Yummy :) The atmosphere pretty relaxed, plenty of seating. And can't forget the retail items, a great selection of items you wouldn't normally find anywhere else. Overall I think I just found my new coffee shop and it is in the heart of Uptown.",

The decor is awesome, the take a book leave a book rack, the projector, the spaces for group projects, all awesome points! The layout makes you never want to leave the place. I stopped in for some tea around 2pm and ONE barista was working. I ordered a hot tea and a muffin, total TWENTY TWO minutes to receive my order and I was the second in line when I came in! I found the pastries a bit over priced considering Amelies sells the exact items in a larger portion, for a cheaper price... and we all know how expensive Amelies is. I finally get my tea and I ask for my muffin and the Barista says i'll get it.... ***waits for 2 minutes** never attempts to get my muffin. I ask another girl behind the counter (who is not really helping the line which has grown since I came in) to give me the muffin she manages to give it to me. No organization, no communication, bad service... I won't be back. Too many other coffee shops with far better service in uptown.",

FYI - pastries are half off after 5 PM, at least on Fridays. Found that out after I purchased a cronut at 4:58 PM. The third party beverages they have on hand are a little overpriced, at least that was my experience when buying a bottle of Lenny Boy kombucha. They do have a nice selection of locally produced goods that are great for gifts. They have multiple seating styles which makes it easy to meet in pairs, small groups or by yourself.",

Did I mention there's also a little space upstairs for kiddos?  Bright, clean, lively ambiance.  Courteous and friendly staff  Good coffee Decent breakfast/food options (though, a little pricey) Great location They've got everything they need, to be a 5-star cafe in my books! :) I'm enjoying the fact that they don't get ridiculously busy right now because they're still relatively new, but I have no doubt that that's going to change very quickly once word gets out!",

There is a wide set of stairs in the front of the store adorned with bean bags and pillows for all to cozy up (Side Note: this would be a perfect location to sit and watch one of the infamous Charlotte summer time storms). They have a small meeting room area in the back that you can reserve to get some work done. And of course they have the traditional tables and chairs upstairs.   They also have a small shopping area with cute trinkets. The assortment includes perfumes, teas, greeting cards, and unique household items like plates and coasters.  To quote some of my sorority sisters, this place is \"TOTS ADORBZ\" (pronounced: toats a-door-bz meaning: totally adorable)",

It's pretty quiet here during the day so I like coming when I feel like  taking a walk and a break from the office.  All their drinks are pretty overpriced, but their ambience is on point. How can I describe it? The wooden paneling give it a rustic vibe, but it kind of also has a modern vintage twist. Littered throughout the store are also offerings of vintage-type goods (they were/are selling a typewriter) as well as cards (think birthday cards) and they use barrel as display tables. The staff are really nice, and they don't kick me out if I want to just stop by and sit down to absorb the ambience.  The only menu item I've tried so far is their mint tea which they brew using tea leaves and not a tea bag. But that also justifies a price hike, about $5 for a normal cup of tea. I might as well order the leaves online. I have yet to get the expensive coffee here, but when I do, I'll give an update.",

A coworker and I walked over this morning, and I'm already trying to figure out how to move in my office so I can just work here full-time.  We got there around 9 a.m., and the place was pretty empty. Or maybe there were a ton of people there, but it's just so huge with a million different seating options that we didn't notice? Regardless, it was nice to be in a coffee shop and have plenty of room to breathe and sprawl - there's a bar along the window, massive stairs with comfy-looking pillows heading to an upstairs area, and tables and cozy chairs around the back. It pretty well takes up the entire space that Savannah Red used to.  My coworker and I were boring and got 16 oz coffees, and it cost $3.75 total - wha?!? A large coffee was only $1.50! And it was GOOD.   We didn't have much time to look around, but we noticed all kinds of snacks, sandwiches, sweets, and of course, drinks. There's a loyalty card, and you get a free drink after 10 purchases, which shouldn't take me too long to knock out.  I feel like I need to walk a fine line of telling everyone how awesome C&TD is so they stay in business but not telling so many people that I have to wait in line. But go there. Seriously.",

I also ordered a Kronut - croissant/donut. It had numerous layers that were flaky like a croissant, but it was much much heavier than a donut. I swear it weighed over a pound lol.I chose the pecan.

There are also numerous chairs and tables upstairs while  the lower level has stools and chairs by the windows. It's a really great use of space. The coffee shop used to be a sports bar, so it's cool to see how much they achieved with the space they were given.  I'll update my review once I've actually tried the coffee.",

    "text": "My new favorite coffee shop! Love the vibe! I decided to stop in here on my way back from breakfast to grab an iced coffee. I was really surprised in how cute this place is. I was expecting it to look like your stereotypical Starbucks as it's connected to a hotel but it was the furthest thing from that.   The inside looks like an old coffee shop that you'd expect to see in a place like NYC. There's also unique local gifts to purchase along the side of the store which i enjoyed looking at waiting for my coffee. The seating was my favorite thing about the place. I'll include a picture as it's hard to explain, but basically it's multiple levels with cushions.   I ended up getting cold brew coffee that was great! Can't wait to come back and try some other drinks off the menu. This was definitely a pleasant surprise!",

    "text": "Disappointment. I came in with high expectations after reading some of the reviews and hearing people rave about it over social media. The location is great and the interior is so unique. With elevated seats, it creates a spacious yet cozy environment that welcomes its guests to sit down and get whatever they need to get done done.   The menu is rather small. There are not many options at all. For such a creative space, I would like to see a comparably creative menu. I settled on a latte because I just love lattes. The guy who rang me up seemed like he hated his job and neither of the employees seemed like they wanted to be there. After placing my order, he forgot to write it down and then asked me to repeat it (which is okay, like no hard feelings haha). He said he had a rough morning, which I totally understand. The person who made my drink told me she tried to make my latte art into a heart, but it's more like a peach now. I kinda just shrugged it off. Now to the actual coffee: bland. There is no distinct flavor of espresso at all. The coffee is just not good in my opinion. I felt like I wasted my money on my cup.   The place is aesthetically pleasing, but not fulfilling for a coffee lover like me.",

It does get a little chilly so be sure to bring a sweater if you are planning to stay for a long period of time.",

For the uninitiated, a kronut is a cross between a doughnut and a croissant.  It has so many layers, fried crispy on the outside and chewy goodness on the inside.  My wife got a coffee version with icing on the top.  I got the pecan pie version.  Both were just incredibly good, right out of the case at room temp.  We visited on a Saturday, being that this is in the lobby of the uptown Mariot, we have heard it gets crazy crowded during the week.  We have not had the pleasure of visiting then, but on this Saturday, it was quiet and calm.  Perfect for enjoying a latte and kronut in the shadows of the skyscrapers of uptown Charlotte.  I really enjoyed the different spaces this place offers.  My latte was solid, nothing spectacular.  Come here for a kronut and a Center city feel.",

I'll start with the positives; the interior has a rustic farmhouse vibe and has an array of seating options that are really cool. There's no shortage in decor and witty sayings to keep your eyes amused. I ordered an iced cold brew coffee and my husband ordered a hot chocolate. As a coffee snob and self proclaimed expert, the brew was decent. Hot chocolate is hard to mess up, so my husband was satisfied. I would return for the coffee if I were in the area.  The negatives; our customer service was not the best. Our barista that checked us out seemed less than impressed with us and annoyed by my questions as a first timer. We also ordered two breakfast sandwiches which would've been delicious except they were cold. Not what we were looking forward to!   I wouldn't make a special trip to return here, but it was neat to check out.",

    "text": "I'm pretty impressed with Coco and what I've seen so far.  Probably the most impactful thing they have going for them is their space.  Located right at the HEART of Charlotte, TRADE & TRYON, we are talking about prime real estate here.  I'm not sure where you would go to park, but I'm a big fan of walking around everywhere.... make a trip out of it and use the light rail, or park at your usual go-to parking deck, and stroll out uptown.  If you enter in from the street, you notice a large lounge and stairs with lots of cushions on it for laying down and relaxing.  Turn around and they've got a projector playing on the wall - great for movie night events (I think there is one coming up).  You can just relax, have your treats and work/watch tv/read...  I like the concept.  Probably the only downside is when people decided to get \"too comfortable\" here and probably aren't wearing the best clothing for said laying around.  Makes for some good people watching though!  The baristas? (I don't know what they call them here) have all been super nice and they always start a conversation with you more than the robotic, \"can I take your order\" at other places.  They know their menu too!  I've had a couple of questions - like what makes a \"dirty chai\" \"dirty\"... and they were very accommodating and knowledgeable.  Along the right side are lots of trinkets and eccentric goods you can shop (good gifts) or inspiring artwork to look at.  And if you continue on to the right, the Marriott Lobby is connected to this place along with Stoke.  There's a large table in the back and also one in front of the place for group meetings and collaborations... and with the 2nd level up top... there should be no problem finding a seat / space here - very versatile.",

Coco and the Director serves coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches, salads, dips, etc. Inside is very nicely decorated with lots of fun stuff for sale! Tons of different tables and chairs. On this particular occasion, we just grabbed a beer. However, I want to go back for lunch to check out some of the salads!  I absolutely loved the stadium seating inside. We enjoyed our beers while listening to a couple play music (seems like they have entertainment here alot).

It boasts a huge are of industrial modern decor! They have cute things for sale aside from food and coffee, and also a great selection of cold bottled drinks lining their walls.  Staff- Fun and friendly! I loved the charismatic people I encountered! Nothing makes an area less relaxing than unfriendly staff, so I was happy to see sweet smiles!  Coffee- I drink a lot of coffee, like a lot! This place had some good stuff! My boyfriend ordered a caramel latte and loved it! I ordered a dirty chai and it was pretty good, not the most flavorful chai but hey their espresso was good! I also noticed they sell a local tea company tea which I thought was a cool touch!  Overall, a must for coffee lovers (and not, I mean they have tea and yummy looking sandwiches)! Also just a great place to go and hang out! I got a lot of work done and was reluctant to leave!",

They did a nice job trying to remove themselves from the Marriot - I would've never thought this would be the type of coffee shop connected to a Marriot - it's funky, cool, very trendy.   3 stars for the service, I was confused and asked a question to who was at the register about their sizes ( low and behold they only have one) but my question was almost met with an eye roll and I felt embarrassed after for asking it, I felt a little dumb, and I think the register worker thought the same. HOWEVER, the gentleman making my coffee, and the one who handed it to me were both very sweet and made me forget about the first worker.   1.5 stars for the coffee, though not \"pricey\" per se, I felt ripped off for what I got. The one size fits all was tiny, and I was running low on fuel, I needed caffeine to give me it's helping hand :( and the child size did not do it for me. On top of that, the coffee was not good, I sipped on it for a moment and threw it out. Had to stop by elsewhere to get my fix.   Cute spot to hang out in, decent service (for the most part), not good coffee. Solid 2.5 stars overall.",

I love that they partner with Green Brothers Juice and offer 4-5 different smoothies. The barista informed me that all iced coffee is cold brew that they get locally from Rock Hill, SC I believe (beans harvested from Columbia). They also offer alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, sparkling wine, and spiked seltzer's) if that's more your vibe for the day. A small lunch menu is offered as well. Tip- order the banana bread and ask for them to warm it up...it is sinful. Overall, this is a solid spot to pop in or hang out! They carry lots of local goods which I am always a fan of and they have a small gift section in case you're in a pinch!",

    "text": "I discovered Coco and the Director while searching on Yelp one day for coffeehouses.  \"What's this?\" I thought.  \"A gigantic coffeehouse with stadium seating?  How did I not know of this?!?  And who are Coco and the Director?\"  So one Sunday afternoon, we decided to venture into Uptown to check it out.  First, let me preface my story by saying that I am not a football fan (yeah, sorry), so I do not keep track of game days.  Second, let me say that going on any Sunday into Uptown during football season (the fall/winter months when you most likely want hot coffee) is a crap shoot unless you know the Panthers are playing out of town.  We drove around for about 20 minutes looking for a (free) parking space.  (I wasn't going to pay $20 to park, the going rate during a game, just to get a cup of coffee.)  After circling for quite some time and going down one one-way street to the next, we finally found an available parking spot on the street.  It was about 1/2 mile away, but it felt like 2 miles after driving so long.    So now we're there.  It wasn't super busy, most likely because of the impossible parking situation.  Upon entering, you're blown away by the size of the place and the amount of detail that was put into it.  It's truly an amazing establishment.  There are rooms with comfy chairs (even a conference table) tucked behind the main room as well.    I ordered a mocha and we split a cronut.  For it not being busy, it took much longer than Starbucks to get our drinks.  And, sadly, my mocha was just tepid.  The taste was ok, but it was really lacking the warmth I was craving.  The refrigerated cronut was just ok, too.  I'm not sure if they're made on premises, but most likely they come pre-packaged.  I certainly wouldn't get it again or spend that much ($6).  It wasn't out-of-this-world, it wasn't super fresh, and it wasn't that big (did I mention it was $6?).    So while I wasn't truly impressed by the food or drink quality, I give Coco and the Director four stars for its amazing atmosphere alone.  (I knocked off that extra star because of the food and drink.)  I might come back if I happen to be Uptown in the future in the morning or afternoon, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way, especially on a game day.",

They have pillows and seat cushions and this is a great place to work on your laptop, meet and chat with friends. They also sell food here too! Fairly priced espresso beverages, I had the iced mocha and it was absolutely perfect. Will visit again when I'm uptown.",

I was with a co-worker who had the same but with cream. He took a couple of sips and threw the rest in the trash.   Skip the cold brew, try something hot and enjoy the decor.",

Someone recommended it as a place to take our engagement photos (we wound up shooting them somewhere else), we had to take a peek at the location and, of course, try their coffee.   I am so impressed with the aesthetics of this place. I was a little disappointed walking up seeing that it's in the bottom of a hotel, BUT beyond you'd have NO idea once you're inside. Coco and the Director does a great job of product placement and leaving art littered throughout the shop so you can maybe instagramable photos.   Coffee was on point. I ordered an iced mocha with almond milk. Note, non-dairy options are soy and almond, no coconut milk. I also ordered a dip hot coffee. I wanted a dark roast, but they were roasting a medium that day. The coffee was incredibly hot and the sleeve didn't help with the heat. Beyond my coffee being \"too\" hot and not offering a dark roast, I am so tickled that Coco and the Director is in my backyard. I can't wait to come back and see this team again!",

They have decent coffee, smoothies from Green Brothers, food options and just an awesome space with my favorite being their staircase seating. I love to just plop down on a couple pillows and work away. Plus they have outlets everywhere which is a definite positive! My least favorite thing is their bathroom location since they connect thru the hotel lobby but it's not the worst thing. Just feels weird if I wanted to leave my stuff there while I do my business outside of their establishment haha. Overall tho, if I lived in Uptown, I'd be here literally everyday to work.",

It's not a cheap cut of food is good quality meat and the chicken I had last Friday on \"chicken Friday\" was so moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside just the way I like it mmmmm. Can't wait til the chef does waffle &chicken Friday.  Today was a brisket that was like an OMG moment!  I was going to work through lunch but I couldn't think while I was eating lol.  Tomorrow and Thursday will me another omg moment. I'm trying to lose weight but my resolution any be to get and ap that shrinks my size on the phone.  So for the price of sandwich , soup or chips and a drink, its well worth eating fresh food that's so yummy.  Would have gotten 5 stars but stood at register for one person to ring and take the order while it looked like 4 people not doing much. Felt they should help out so not to lose business  But I happy mmmmm so it out weighs the order process",

Overall a great place to hang out or to meet someone. I also love that it's attached to the Hilton hotel!

Although there aren't many people that pass through the shops, I am constantly rooting for them to pick up a customer base!",

    "text": "Charlotte is now home to a few coffeeshops with grassroots character.  I don't know that I'd call C&D grassroots, since it's heavily tied to the Marriott, but they show promise for sure.  I certainly keep them in play on my coffeehouse rotation.  The biggest thing going for them is their location.  You can't really beat the exposure offered from the Trade and Tryon intersection, and the space is massive for a coffeeshop.  They made great use of natural light via floor to ceiling storefront windows.  There is a second, loft-style, level with overlook seating, and of course, the infamous \"stadium seating.\"  The stadium seating is nothing more than stair stepped bench levels that offer a grand seating area with various coffeehouse-esk pillows and cushions strewn about.  Works for me.  The menu is limited and offers no blended type beverages, so if you're looking for a frappuccino, step on around the corner to the nearby buck stop.  They do offer some deli style sandwiches and such in their readymade cooler.  In addition you'll find quirky snacks and a variety of bottled beverages.    There is a book swapping station.  Take one, leave one if you will.  There are also a few giftable items for purchase.  If you wander around the corner towards the back of the bar area, there are larger tables for sharing that are a bit more private.  Up front there's one large community table beneath the large, suspended projection television.    I don't think the coffee is the greatest in the world, but it's not horrible either.  They offer a frequent punch card, and it's a great mobile working spot.  The Wi-Fi is one and the same as that of the Marriott, but it is free.  The backside of the space opens up directly into the Marriott lobby, and is the only outlet to a restroom, as the space does not have its own designated bathroom.  Each time I've visited, I've seen more and more people taking advantage of the space.  It's definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "I try to find a new coffee shop every Sunday to sit and write. I finally made it to Coco to see what it was all about. I must say that the pictures of the \"stadium\" seating is what really had me needing to come here. I also entered with the expectation that the prime seating would likely be crowded, it was. Yet I found a cozy spot tucked away in the back at a huge table...alone!  I ordered a coffee and a matcha cronut. I was anxious to try it because well, it's a cronut! Who doesn't like croissants and donuts, and a mash-up of the two couldn't be bad. I will say that the cronut was a bit sweet for me. Specifically, the green icing on the top and then the additional icing that filled the middle. I don't think it was needed. I also felt it was a little too greasy. I don't think I'd order another cronut based on my experience with this one.   In addition, one of the reasons why it had taken me so long to visit this place is because it's in the heart of the city and I knew parking would be difficult. Well, I spent $18 on parking alone. Do they validate? I guess it's a little late for me to ask that question. That was the only thing that will make me less likely to come back, not unless I rent a scooter, bike, or public transportation.   Overall, I think Coco is a very cool place to just sit and have coffee and write. I really wish it was in a different location with private parking.",

    "text": "One of our favorite coffee spots in Uptown Charlotte! This place opens very early (6am) and closes late so it's perfect for early morning coffee or as a place to finish up work late into the evening. The interior seating area is one of the reasons  that helps make this cafe stands out from the others. The coffee and selection of pastries (especially the croissants and cronuts) are amazing as well. Finally, the baristas are kind and helpful. To see and experience what the cafe is like, visit our Instagram page @kukoomedia !",

I love that the projector was going so I could watch the nearby NBA all star game while getting work done. I'd definitely come again! Only downfall is the lack of parking nearby as it's in the heart of uptown.",

They have a sandwich menu which keeps changing every week. They have an incredible idea of the architecture of a coffee shop. You really feel like sitting there and working. As many reviews, it has a stadium seating.  They have two different seating areas one is on the left which is more if you want to sit alone and study or work. Other is the lab where you can book the table for meetings many meetings and interviews were going on there. Coming to the coffee they have amazing local roasts which you can try. Baristas are great they are very friendly. They have a variety of cronuts, croissants, loaves of bread. They even have sandwiches, soups, and salads.  Well overall this is a great place for anyone students, working professionals or any coffee lovers.",

I ordered a cinnamon sugar cronut and a latte...for $12!!! The coffee tasted burnt and had I tried it before I left the restaurant I would have asked for something else. The Cronin was good, but definitely not worth $6. This was a one-time deal for me. I most likely won't go back and I don't know that I'll recommend it to anyone either. The food/drinks just aren't worth the prices they charge.",

In addition, the music is not blaring so you can easily have a great conversation without yelling.   The coffee is super fresh and the espresso is smooth. My go to lately has been the latte with soy milk. Super frothy and enough sweetness without adding any sugar to it.   I haven't had their food yet, but they always have a featured Sandwich of the Day for around $9-$12. Their baked good also look grand, which they mentioned they get from some local bakeries. The one that always catches my eye is the cronut. One day I will eat my guilt and order it... one day.",

    "text": "I had a hankering for cronuts on my road trip and mapped out to visit this spot many days in advance. There were a couple other cronut spots in Charlotte that looked like they might have them on select days, but this was the only place I could find online that seemed to always have them in stock + have an interchanging variety of flavors. I also wanted to the place to serve a local coffee and Coco and the Director uses a local roast out of South Carolina.   This cafe is located inside the Marriott hotel in Uptown Charlotte. I visited in late Summer 2019 and the construction was insane downtown. I ended up parking about 5 blocks away and paying the meter because there was so much construction it was impossible to navigate/park closer. It's a beautiful walk, though, and there's some really cool sculptures and water features close by.   The environment here reminds me of a co-working space or a tech company in San Fransisco. It's well spread out with multi-level seating, tables for groups upstairs and down, and reserved meeting spots around the corner. There's also a ton of outlets and free wifi - I would definitely recommend this coffee shop for plugging in and working.  I ordered the maple bacon cronut and an espresso over ice with a splash of oat milk. It took us about 5 minutes to get through the order as the gal could not hear a word I was saying with all the noise behind her, and I could tell she was frustrated. I asked a couple questions about the different cronuts and she recommended the plain one for me as I didn't want anything too sweet or too savory. I asked for that one but when I got the box it had the maple one in it - no complaints, though, it looked amazing.   My espresso came out a few minutes later and the staff were very strange about calling out my name. I was standing right there but they were being petty about who would say it and arguing tensely amongst themselves. They forgot to put milk in there which I noticed after I left and was bummed about because they charged me extra. The cronut was also way too sweet with the pounds of thick cream they had in the center. The dough itself was delicious and had a nice savory touch to it but they ruined it by overloading it with the sweet cream in the middle. Don't get me wrong, I wiped it off after a couple bites and ate the whole thing, but I'd never pay $6 for it again.   This is a really cool spot to work out of, the espresso was tasty, and I would come back to try a more savory version of the cronut varieties. However, the odd staff experience kind of left a bad taste in my mouth and their prices are little higher than I think they need to be.",

    "text": "One of my absolute top favorite coffee spots in Charlotte! Within walking distance of the epic center and so many delicious restaurants! The layout and ambiance of this coffee shop is what constantly draws me here to complete work! Pastries are from the 2 time National Bread and Pastry Champion, Sugarrman! These pastries are outstanding!! Pairs perfect with the caramel latte! If I have time, after a cycle class at cycle south I walk to CoCo and the Director for a Green Brothers- Ms. CoCo- Smoothie! ITS. SO. GOOD! CoCo and the Director is perfect for group meetings, there's a co-working space in the back and also a large table in the front! Smaller tables for smaller groups! And of course the stair seating for solo or couple lounging! It's all soooooo perfect! Don't believe me, come visit for yourself!",

When you walk in, you'll first notice the \"lit\" up seating area which is different from most coffee shops. It's very casual and relaxing. There is a second level or more seating. Also, on the other side of the order area is more seating options that are more private. I loved how there was an area that was dedicated to books and games. There even was a projector that had a movie playing while I was there. I ordered the cinnamon sugar cronut (first time) and an iced caramel macchiato and both were delicious. Servers were pleasant. I'll definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "Kronuts, kronuts, kronuts!!!!  I must admit, yeast-based baked goods are my Kryptonite. While you might not expect to find good food in a hotel lobby, Coco has a lot of great quick grabs that'll have you wanting to come back. It must be something in those dang kronuts because I swear that I'm bewitched.  Let's break down the star of the show. First of all, these kronuts aren't golden brown, they're dark brown. A lot of caramelization is happening here, and with it a lot of flavor. They've done a great job folding this dough and when you get one you can peel the layers off individually and try to make it last as long as possible. As for myself, I like to get a bunch of layers together because I love the crunchy texture outside, and flaky inside.  I've had the cold brew a couple of times as well. It's a great, low-acid option for those that need their caffeine fix pronto. The staff is such a pleasure and it's not just your usual retail chit chat, I love a team that engages with their customers.  They do seasonal specials and sandwiches for lunch and next time, really next time I promise I'll forego the sweets in favor of trying something new, maybe... but those pastries, they're calling me!  As others have said, parking is a bit difficult. If you're riding into Charlotte I suggest the Lynx light rail and just leaving your car at one of the many park & ride locations. The CTC/Uptown station is a mere two blocks away from Coco, just walk through the Epicentre corridor, down the stairs, and walk across Trade and Tryon, Coco is on the corner that the Halal cart is always at.  If you're looking for a place to bunker down with a book or laptop for an hour or so, Coco has you covered. If you just need your coffee, they're a real crowd-pleaser!",

There are regular tables set out and then a HUGE area to lounge and study or catch up with a friend, pillows for comfort included. You can also rent a space in the back for meetings which is pretty nice.    I loved all the cute little gifts they had available for purchase, if you're in a bind for a quick present--this is the place to drop by.   Pricing was fine and the cold brew was great. Service was friendly and attentive, I would absolutely recommend it and can't wait to go back and try a kronut!",

They also serve wine and beer and they have a small selection of pastries. We tried the pumpkin croissant and it was delicious ($2 - half price pastries today yay!!) and had Dirty Chai Latte - it was alright. Nice staff, interactive and lots of people were coloring something and having wine today some kind of \"adult coloring and wine\" day I think.  Above all it's the ambience that we would want to go back again.",

There's another side of the place with a TV and lounge chairs, one area with a wide desk, and another area upstairs with seating where you can easily eat lunch!   I had the chicken Caesar salad, and it was amazing! I was apprehensive because it was a bit pricey ($13 I believe), but it was a decent size, and the chicken was GREAT quality!!   I also got a bottled Michelin Ultra (I was SO happy they had my favorite beer here) and an iced cappuccino. I normally don't like coffee that's not from Starbucks, but this drink is great!  On top of all this, the location is incredibly convenient. I happened upon this place as I was starving and looking for a different restaurant. What a great detour!  I will definitely be back next time im in Charlotte. (:",

While the decor screams Portland, it features a well thought out interior that has many work spaces (and outlets), huge open layout, and stadium seating for the occasional small concert. My wife and I swung in here on a whim on Friday night and were pleased to stumble upon a small concert and enjoyed a beer in the stadium seating. Overall a very enjoyable and relaxing experience. I would love to use the space during the day to get a coffee and plug into work to knock some stuff out. Overall a really cool space - especially since it is so un-charlotte and right in the middle of town. Props to the owners for having the vision and confidence to bring this neat concept to Charlotte.",

There's an upstairs lounge and they even serve beer in the cold case if you want to grab a drink in the afternoon.   I usually just get a drip coffee so I can't speak to their espresso drinks. The coffee is pretty good though not gourmet. I prefer it over Starbucks and many other chains in the area.  Their breakfast sandwiches are quite good. The one healthier option - the chicken sausage and egg bagel - is kind of hard to eat though. The sausage casing causes the links to pull completely out of the sandwich on the first bite. Kind of silly to point out but I don't get this one anymore because it won't stay together.   I've gotten a chicken Cesar salad before and it was decent, though not worth the price. For a coffee, yogurt, and salad I think my total came to $21.   I like the place but it's not my favorite. Definitely a convenient and decent choice around Trade and Tryon though.",

I get back to my desk to find, sauce on the sammie, not on the side.   No biggie, I'll deal.  The meat was too greasy for my liking, with fat blobs that I'm sure some people love but not me.  The sauce I though would be hot was so very mild (not a bad thing in my book).   I had, had their porchetta before and that was super yummie the first go, the second go wasn't as good.

Although, they don't have much selection with coffee flavors, I tried their Caramel Latte and it wasn't too bad. I'm also huge tea fanatic and I had to try their Governors Grey from the Charleston Plantation and it was good. I typically put honey in my tea and I'm impress their honey was good too. (I'm really picky with my honey. Real honey over fake honey) This place has a modern look, but homey feeling. Compare with the coffee shops I've tried in Uptown, this would be my favorite. I haven't tried their food yet, but I'll save that for the next time I'm there.",

I cannot wait to be an regular here, the staff was amazingly friendly and inviting. You can tell they really believe in the vision.

The intersection of Trade and Tryon looks like it will be the next hot location with Coco, Essex across the street and the new Bank of America Plaza opening next Spring.  I had a cinnamon and brown sugar latte which was amazing.  I picked out the banana bread from the bakery display.  It was delicious and totally different than the typical sliced loaf.  This was more cake-like and lighter with a crumble topping.  I saw a lot of other things I would like to try next time.  They also have some sandwiches and salads.  Prices are very reasonable.  I hate to say it but this place really puts Starbucks to shame.",

Oh yeah everything is for sale,they have the cutest little trinkets that you can find. It reminds me of things found on Etsy.   I had a cronut.

I feel like the tables by the window left me a little slouched over trying to do work, but are great for conversation.

I have heard the maple bacon is great as well! I also tried the almond croissant, really really good! There was so much I wanted to try but my diet would not allow lol.

My fiancee and I were looking for a place that served alcohol and coffee in a coffee shop setting. We tried out Coco and the Director and were not disappointed!   They have this crazy unique stadium seating facing a projector. The staff mentioned to us that they plan to show Panthers games on a big screen. Also, they said that you could buy any beer or wine at Stoke and bring it over.   We'll be back to Coco. The ONLY downside is that you have to pay for parking but there is an LAZ lot that is $5 after hours nearby on Church St.  Overall, would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Unique! Love this new spot. With little signage and no outdoor seating it may not look like much from the outside, but the inside is another story. It's VERY big. There is stadium seating (a favorite for pictures) with a big screen TV, an upstairs with a few tables, a row lining the window, around the corner is another area with quieter working spaces or big group seating tables. They sell fantastic coffee and Charleston Plantation teas. They also make homemade unique sandwiches. A few pastries and sweets are in the case by the register. They also have healthy or fun prepared options like brownies or a superfood salad. I would highly recommend coming here to work on you screenplay, do some homework, or meet with a group of friends.",
