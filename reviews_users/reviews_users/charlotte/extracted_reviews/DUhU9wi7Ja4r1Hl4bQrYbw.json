These idiots let 8 or more orders back up before handing them out while 17 people waited for their food in a hurry to catch their plane. This lack of service would be bad enough, but in an airport it is unacceptable. The manager was a complete mess and looked as if she was on methodone. She was useless, clearly needing to be fired. I sent a long email to the owner, and shockingly it came back undeliverable. no surprise there, they are probably as inept as their employees. I doubt they even care if they get good reviews or not as they have a captive audience who have limited food options and have to eat this swill. I sent the same email to BK corporate and asked for a return phone call....something needs to be done about this. Next time, I will take the time to go to Chock-fil-A and get real food and great customer service.",

The line at this Burger King gets pretty long during lunch hours, and the employees haven't figured out a way to process their many customers in a more expedient manner. It took about 20 - 25 minutes for me to get in line, order my food, and sit down with my meal.  One perk of there being so many customers though is that everything has to be made fresh. Those were some of the hottest fries I've ever had!  Other than that, the food here is pretty standard for a Burger King.",

She sat and talked to a coworker about personal things for a few minutes with me just standing at the register. That displeased me more than the disappointing food.

She handed my receipt and card back without even looking at me or saying thank you,  still talking to the coworker.  I still wanted honey mustard, so finally I said Excuse me, to which she replied, Huh? I repeated myself and she says they will help you with sauces down there when you pick up your order.  I went to the other end, they threw my chicken fingers in a bag and folded it, never asking me if i wanted any sauce at all. And no thanks or nothing.   I was hoping the chicken fingers would at least be good, but no such luck - they were dry/hard and not good at all.

Being that Burger King is one of the only places open really early, I chose it.  Plus, I enjoy their breakfast items.    I know it's come to be commonplace to expect poor service at fast food restaurants, but...why?  I worked in fast food in my younger days and provided quality service.  I was quick, I was knowledgeable, I was friendly, and I was attentive.  Is that really too much to ask?  If you can't make it in fast food...where can you make it?    Anyway, I stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast.  I stepped up to order when it was my turn, and after the co-worker next to him finished talking to him...or at least took a break.  I placed my order and then stepped down the line to await my order.  I looked around and saw chutes full of pre-made sandwiches sitting under the warming lamp.  Employees were congregated in the back talking.  And more employees were congregated around the register talking.  Nobody was working except for the cashier, and even he was doing a half-assed job.  The cashier abandoned his register and came over to fill the first guy's order.  He then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order.  Some jerk-off airport employee behind me \"kindly\" offered to take the coffee I had just been poured so I could get a \"fresh\" cup.  Thankfully, the BK employee continued to give me my cup of coffee.    The food was good and still semi-warm, but is it too much to ask that people do their jobs while on duty?  Do you really need 10 BK employees standing around doing nothing?",

She took like half an hour to check if they could even make it like that. I mean what the ****! And then when I get my Burger, there was no patty in it....! What the **** ! So, I go back to the hostess and I was like where is the patty...? She is like you said no meat. I was like yeah... That's why I asked you to sub a veggie patty. And her response was gold. She said that they consider ALL the patty to be meat. And the worst part is that they were all laughing at me for wanting a 4 cheese burger with veggie patty...!  I didn't want to create a scene... But these people need to respect the customers... The stupid ungrateful bunch of illiterate jerks....!",

    "text": "I didn't walk up to Burger King with high expectations to begin with therefore this review is just going to focus on one menu item.    Side order of buffalo chicken strips.   Granted it's difficult to fully determine how an order is prepared based upon that little image of chicken strips stacked upon each other up there on top of the menu board, but what I could determine from that avatar of an image is that the stack of buffalo chicken parts isn't drenched, soaking, dripping and or otherwise smothered with buffalo sauce.   There's no way to eat this without a bib and and a spatula.  Not a good choice for running between flights. Good thing I didn't think I could just eat it on the plane.   The item should be called buffalo soup with chicken strips.   As to the flavor? If you can get past the gooey consistency it's a \"meh\"   Avoid the buffalo chicken, just get the plain. It's probably a better level of ordinary.",

The food came out fast and hot as expected and it definitely gave me what I was looking for to start the morning.  Having to get through security that early in the morning, I just wanted something in my stomach to start the day.  For the airport, it's good to have a fast food place located inside of it depending on your situation and how fast you need to eat.  At the same time, I wish \"fast\" did not equate to \"poorer quality\"... I guess Europeans have it right when they take their time eating their meals....",

The pretty lady at the counter tells me how much I owe her. I hand her my credit card, she swipes and hands me a receipt with my order number on it. I grab myself a soda and proceeded to the waiting section. A few minutes after, they call my number, I pick up my food and off to my gate we go.  My experience was actually very pleasant. I came for food, I got food, I ate and I was satisfied. No bad experiences, no drama, no violent reactions. I would buy my whopper sandwiches here again and again and again and again.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!",
