If it wasnt for the bad service, I would have given this specific location a 5 Star. The hostess was rude, did not smile, and as I walked through the doors holding a baby carrier she just watched. Our server was extremely slow, and the restaurant was not busy enough to make up for her lack of attentiveness. I was disappointed to say the least.",

At times, I've left a restaurant feeling like we were an inconvenience because the waiter was just aggravated due to multiple tables or personal issues. Curtis gave 5-star service from beginning to end. His hard work & professionalism will take him far in life.",

I realized that he was a bit \"too friendly\" when he sat at our table while taking the order. I did not mind that, but I though it was a bit odd. Furthermore, at one point he put his foot on a chair in a \"captain Morgan\" pose while talking to us. Also,  we had to hunt him down for everything. When the food was ready, he brought our food out with someone else's. He dropped our food off and not once came to check on us. Even when we hunted him down for our check, he never asked how everything  was. He told my boyfriend to \"sit down\" when he went to hunt Greg down for a check. I know he was joking around, but it was just the wrong timing (not to mention that you have to have a limit on what you say to the customer). I did not like my enchilada soup and I did not eat it, however, since the server never came by I never had a chance to tell him. At the end we were in there such a long time, I thought I will gladly pay for the nasty soup so that I don't have to wait for another hour. Lastly, the restaurant was dead and we sat next to two dirty tables for the majority of our visit. A lot of room for improvement.",

My second visit was an offense when the manager spoke to me in a tone that suggested I was a problem to be managed, rather than a valued customer to be served (my medium-rare sirloin came to me ice-cold).  Today I tried again because the location is good and I like the overall predictable atmosphere.  The server took 5 minutes to acknowledge me though there were only two customers seated at the bar. I ordered my beer and mentioned that the air conditioner was quite cold. She suggested that she \"could ask someone to turn it down, but it would take over an hour for the system to adjust the temperature anyway (shrug)\" I assured her it would respond within a minute or so, and she grudgingly complied with a snarled affect. Fortunately, the freezing air subsided and the ribs were fine. Unfortunately, her tip reflected her attitude. I suppose it's reasonable that this spot is focused on the short term visits from the extended stay hotel across the street but repeat locals should avoid it.",

As we were being seated, the hostess and a waitress argued about who was going to sit us because we didn't look like good tippers. We were sat in the back, by the cold door, and away from everyone. Ten min after sitting there, the waiter came to the table to tell us that the fryer is down and that it's so bad there that we should leave. Got it buddy...we left.

I walked/ran 4 miles and came out on the opposite side. Omg I was so tired and hungry. I would have to walk around 4 miles to get my car.   So I saw a chilis and walked over there. My phone was about to die so the bartender charged my phone for me. Such a sweet girl. I get sliders, egg rolls and boneless wings. I always ask for no bacon on my burgers and every time I get bacon on it doesn't matter where I go even when I repeat no bacon. I never understand.   This time I got it and didn't see the bacon I was like wow they got it right. I tasted bacon and spit it all up. I was so upset. I got her attention and she was visibly upset. She was so apologetic. She went to the kitchen and yelled at the cook when he told her she didn't specify that on the ticket. She said she def did. So she told the manager and they not only cooked me new burgers but they comp'd my entire meal.   How sweet. I was in shock they have never done that. Dylan was the manager and he came out to apologize and check on me. The server, I can't believe I forgot her name(Short pretty petite girl with dark hair) to the host were so nice. Hands down best chilis I been to. Thanks. I will most def be back when I'm in the area.",

I guess there's no such thing as safe.   So when Mickey and Mooch - shoot, when Qdoba - is next door, why the heck would you bother with this dump?",

One of my coworkers went and ask the bartender should we seat ourselves, she said no and came over a few minutes later to seat us. Our waiter Keith came by to take our drink order, in an attempt to avoid rushing I explained we were on an hour break and wanted to make sure the kitchen would be able to accommodate our time restraints. I requested to place my food order along with my drink order. Keith seemed annoyed, and made it uncomfortable at first. Anyway the food arrived really fast, and was decent. We were able to dine in and make it back to work with time to spare. The food was fine but I still wouldn't go back to this location, I like to spend my money where I feel welcomed. My first instinct was to leave when we were left standing at the hostess station and against my better judgment I stayed. Won't make that mistake again.",

    "text": "I love Chilis so in my heart of hearts I can't give them less than 2 stars but our experience was AWFUL!   No one standing the hostess stand. We waited for a few minutes before someone emerged from the kitchen and approached us with a \"How many?\" No I'm sorry for the wait, How are you this evening... Nothing just How many? We stated we had two and she said \"lounge or restaurant?\" We looked kinda confused and simply stated , \"we would like a booth.\" She points to a booth in the bar and we said that table is dirty. She grabbed menus and started to walk away... She didn't state, \"Follow me, This way.\" Again nothing. It was actually quite rude. She takes us to a small booth in the dining room area and before we can even sit down the server who's section we were apparently being said in says, \"IM CUT!\". What a unprofessional way of handling that situation. Right in front of guest saying you are cut. Makes them feel extremely unwelcome or like a nuisance. I work in the service industry and would never say I'm cut in front of a table. You handle any of that behind the scene. Then it took forever for someone to come to the table and guess who greets us? The server that was so called cut, I'll call her server 1! She greets us and because it had been so long we gave our whole order then.   After awhile another server comes up to us, she was super nice and I believe they were team serving, I'm gonna call her server 2. Server 1 then comes back and says, \"You don't have your chips and salsa? I'm going to kill her!\" and walks off. Again SO unprofessional! Once they brought out the chips I asked to have my cup of soup. They brought my dates soup. Then return to get my cup of soup and bring the wrong soup out! At this point I'm trying to be patient but are you even looking at my ticket in the kitchen? There are seat number and an order with all my information on it. Well needless to say the rest of our hot food order arrived before my simple cup of soup. I'll say I know how Chilis works because I use to work for them so like most restaurants the soups are made and kept in soup wells and servers are responsible for \"prepping them\".   Moving on to the main order.. Which wasn't right. I definitely made changes to the Quesadilla Explosion salad but I always do. I asked for a different chicken on my salad and extra dressing on the side. My salad came out dry with all dressing on the side so I did have to ask for extra dressing again which is something super small that would normally not iterated me but after everything else going wrong I was pissed.   I ask for a box for the rest of my salad and some Togo dressing. This takes forever from server 2 and for some reason she brought a bag and then went to get dressing, consolidate your steps is like day one of serving!   Side note: server 2 was extremely nice and at least acknowledged how awful our experience was and apologized for the mistakes.   We never had a manager touch our table. If we had the. We most definitely would have explained what had happened. Again I really hate to rate them low because I love Chilis. It was my first job and I worked as a hostess and a server so I do know how the system is suppose to work. I would have been completely embarrassed if this was an experience that I had delivered.   Side note: This isn't the first bad experience I have had at this location. I have ordered take out and gotten home to find that my whole order was wrong. They really could use some work!!",

My wife and her friends say it is not normally like this, but I will not be back. My summary would be undertrained and understaffed.",

Highly recommend you go in and sit at the bar because of their happy hour food deals. Almost every appetizer on the menu is half price if not cheaper and they are full portion sizes for most of them!

It had huge pieces of chicken and sausage with a creamy base and just the right amount of kick...I loved the spicy after taste each bite left the tortilla strips on top were a nice crunchy kick to top it off!  And just a regular house salad, lettuce, cheese tomatoes,cucumbers, onions and cruotons...it came in a small bowl and for the lunch portion I considered it a lot of food.  The only reason I didn't give more stars is because it took forever to get our lunch...we only had an hour for lunch and 40 minutes later we were still without our food...  But for a quick bite, its a good deal....depending on what you get its either $6, $7, or $8...and that's not too bad!",

I'm a little disappointed because they don't offer the pork carnitas tacos anymore. They were a gluten free item with corn tortillas but they don't offer them anymore. The ribs are good. Although, last time I had the ribs with honey chipotle sauce. I could hardly taste the sauce and the ribs were a little dry, which was a first for me bc they're ribs are usually juicy.",

The floor hadn't been swept and many of the tables hadn't been bussed. A nice young lady got our drinks for us but it took our server Davante another 10 minutes to show up at our table and take our orders. My wife's salad arrived first. She said it was okay. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after the salad. She had smoked wings with ranch dressing, they arrived with barbecue sauce. I had the Ancho salmon. It was over cooked and tasteless. We had to ask the guy delivering the food to refill our drinks since Davante was too busy chatting in the kitchen to do his job. When it came time to leave he was nowhere to be found so we used the electronic check out. My wife was so displeased that she complained about the meal on the Chili's website.",

I live over 20 miles away and my disabled son had a doctors apt at 2pm just down the street from this location. so we thought we would stop for lunch.  I left my home at 12:15 and we arrived at the location about 12:50pm. sat down and quickly ordered drinks and then the 2 for $20 in which I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta WITH EXTRA TOPPINGS (and I made sure she knew what I was talking about by stating \"you know the sauce, tomatoes etc?\" she said yes extra toppings. daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles. the pickles came out fast and were very hot. as we got towards the bottom the off tasting set in and to see the BROWN grease pooling in the bottom of the container was enough to know they haven't changed the oil lately.  finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the REGULAR way. after a few minutes I ask the server for more alfredo sauce. I sit there and wait and wait. finally she brings it and by now I ask for a box because I have run out of time. I box my meal ( think I ate about 5 bites) and my daughter is about finished. OH AND BY THE WAY- I HATE those kiosk things. how my daughter managed to charge $2 by playing games to my check I don't know! DONT LET YOUR KIDS PLAY with that machine unless you want additional charges added to your check!  I paid with the kiosk because I couldn't wait on my slow server anymore and the stupid thing did not print out my receipt !i had less than 15 minutes to load up my son and get around the corner.  slowest server I have ever had. I was in a hurry but this is why I ASKED FOR MY ENTREE in a specific way- so I didn't have to ask again later!  the grease apparently got to my daughter, because as soon as I had loaded my son in the car she was at the front of my car and threw up.   I am so disappointed. I usually love Chili's but today wasn't their best by far!",

    "text": "It has been awhile since we have been to a Chili's, but we had a couple gift cards to use so we decided to take advantage of them for a Saturday lunch.  It looks like the place has been updated/renovated, looks nice and clean.  We arrived just before 12, and there were only maybe 2-3 other tables at the time.  Service was slow, it did get a little more crowded as the time went on, but it still just seemed to drag a bit at times.  I will also add that our server didn't really seem to want to be there compared to watching the other servers who were happy with their tables, but ours was just meh, which may have added to the slowness.  We asked for to go boxes and our server did bring them, but after we filled our boxes, he never cleared the table with the dirty plates.  You would think he would want to make room for us to be able to sign the receipt and leave a tip...  We started with the bottomless chips and salsa, which has always been a good consistent starter at Chili's, really like their salsa.  Husband got the dry rub ribs with corn and fries and I had the chicken/mushroom fajitas.  I have had the fajitas before, but I do not recall them having the mushrooms with them, really like that addition.  The ribs were good as always, corn was good, but the fries were overcooked.  My fajitas were good too!  I love that you get a lot of leftovers - that is if you eat the proper portions.  Plus it is easy to fill up on the chips and salsa that you don't end up eating much of your meal.  So I had plenty of mine to take with me.  I do wish they would give you more fajita shells, as I think it came with 4, maybe 5, and that is not many with the mass amount of filling you get.  I just turned the leftovers into a rice, meat, veggie bowl.    Chili's is an okay choice, they do have consistently good food, but that is all for me.  I would probably give them a 3.5, but they are not quite in the 4-5 star range for me.  Not great/outstanding, but not bad.  It is just not close enough to us that we think about it, plus we have places that we love going to that we would like to go to instead.  I would still recommend and would go back to Chili's.",

I can make my meal there stretch into three meals and that's only spending $10 plus tip!  I think I've reviewed other Chili's before (yes that's how much I like them)  but I've started frequenting this one since I moved near by and it has yet to disappoint.  I've only sat in the bar area because it's never been crowded and I can take advantage of their happy hour specials.  It appears as if they have added their 3 for $10 option to their regular menu. (flip it over and  it's on the back page.)  You get a drink, soup/salad/chips and salsa, and an entree for $10.  But wait, there's more! If you are a Chili's rewards member then you get to add even more food for free!  Everytime you check in with your rewards menu on the computer device on the table, you get to chose between a free soda/non alcoholic beverage OR BOTTOMLESS CHIPS and SALSA!!!! nom nom nom.  That stuff is addictive.  I start nibbling and next thing I know, BAM! I need a refill.  Blushing a little bit here.   So, here's my go to order! Chilis Rewards freebie: chips and salsa 3 for $ selection: coke zero, bowl of chicken enchilada soup, and honey chipotle chicken crispers with corn and fries.  It is plenty of food for either more than one person or for multiple meals.   I am stuffed when I leave there and leave with food for later.   Service has been great, food has been great, and the restaurant has been super clean.  There's always plenty of parking and even when the main dining room is busy you can easily find a seat in the bar area.   I can't wait to go back this weekend and get my fix on those bottomless chips and salsa.",

I have joined the Chili's Club and get a free dessert, or free salsa w/ chips or a free coke on a regular basis!  I enjoy walking thru the door and every one recognizes me and calls me by name.  I have NEVER been disappointed with the food and have recommended this Chili's to my customers, who after I get back with my Take out lunch, will get up and ask what I have and then go to Chili's while they wait for us to finish their vehicle.  I have never heard any of them complain about the service OR the food, and most of them started waiting for lunch on the days they are coming here and plan on having lunch at Chili's.  After reading some of the comments - I have to say, I don't believe what was said -  BUT I DO Believe, that some folks are just not happy unless they can complain about something. (Like wine actually Taste different depending on the shape of the glass??? Really????)  But, just know, I Love the food, the employees, the customer service, the management and the greeter at the front door.  ALL of it make my lunch so enjoyable!  Thank you Chili's Employees - you bring light to my day!",

    "text": "While I usually go to non-chain restaurants,  I enjoy Chili's.  It started with a southwestern egg roll obsession in high school.   On this trip, the hostess was strange. We told her how many and that we wanted a booth. She said something about sitting us in the bar area because service would be faster or something. The booths there were small, so we asked for a different section which seemed to bother her. Eventually we were seated in a wide booth.  Our server was much better and friendlier than the hostess. We opted for the two for $35 deal which is pretty great: an app to share, two entrees, a dessert to share and two presidente  margaritas.    The food was good. It wasn't anything groundbreaking but we'll cooked comfort food. We had Texas cheese fries which were hot and loaded with cheese and bacon. I got the chicken fajitas. The chicken was juicy and came out sizzling with peppers and onions. I also appreciate that guacamole is one of the toppings you can use. I love the flavor of the black beans and mixing that with the rice. Dessert was a berry cobbler with ice cream. The cobbler was sweet and balanced with cinnamon.  All around a pleasing meal.   For a late meal, it was noisy. One table in particular was really noisy so the environment was not the best.  On our way out, the hostess was sitting down with her shoes off and looking at her phone. She didn't acknowledge us walking out. Not a \"bye\" or \"thank you\".   So overall a good meal at a decent price. Customer service could use a little work.",

I came in a few nights ago with my boyfriend and best friend to get some dinner; when we walked in the door there was no hostess to greet us. we stood there for 7 minutes before someone came up to us and when she did, she said: \"Hey guys. Sorry but it's going to be a 10-15 minute wait.\" Keep in mind it was a little past 8 and there were only a few tables seated. Obviously, I left. Drove to Red Robin at that point. Just very disappointed in the constant poor service.",

Our server wasn't very attentive and my poor grandma literally never got her water with lemon. He brought her a water and then ten minutes later we asked him for lemons again and five more minutes later he brought her a ramekin of limes. A few of us ordered the 2 for $25 because we wanted the skillet cookie but he neglected to tell us the only dessert they had available that evening was cheesecake which nobody really wanted but we sort of had to get. The queso (and this is not the servers fault) was literally watered down. You could see it separating from the cheese. I love Chili's chips and queso but this stuff was inedible. This was not the best experience we have had here and will likely venture to another location next time I'm craving some good old fashioned Chili's food.",

Took 30 minutes to get the food (I believe she forgot about us) when she did bring our food it was COLD soup and cold tacos. She said they ran out of avocado (clearly they put half a slice on one side of my taco and my other two tacos were left out lol) they not only ran out of the avocado but the main sauce for the damn tacos! Ummm sooo why not respectfully ask if I would like to order something else since they ran out of the ingredients??? So let me say this about the service her facial expressions said EVERYTHING she was thinking smh!  Manager never came back to speak with us guess he was offended that we were offended...smh!",

    "text": "Tuesday's is our night out, and we frequently shop in this shopping center.  I had concerns that it was going to be too much like Applebee's, with all the focus on booze and food service being secondary.  Nobody was stationed at the front desk nor seemed interested in greeting us.  After a pregnant wait in an almost empty restaurant at 7 PM on a Tuesday, we eventually were led toward an area and my wife requested the quietest area you have, and with a chair, not a booth.  That set off some kind of internal argument and it was announced that the quiet area was closed, followed by a change of mind while I'm hobbling along on my cane.  The man seating us literally threw the menus on the table letting us know his disgust.  Our waitress was pleasant, but obviously very new, lacking basic knowledge of the menu and did not ask how we wanted the burgers cooked until I stated a preference.  The baked potato soup was very good and at the appropriate temperature.  After the burgers arrived, i grabbed the glass salt shaker and nothing came out.  I gave it a solid rap on the table and still nothing came out.  The salt apparently was one big clump, perhaps someone filled the shaker while it was still wet.  How does something like that go unnoticed?  While we are eating, another employee was behind me, loudly sorting out silverware on a table that looks to be permanently dedicated to holding dirty dishes.  She eventually found us a working salt shaker, but no action was taken to take the bad one out of circulation.  The burgers were OK, albeit a bit greasy.   The soda came in a really cheap plastic mug.  Real root beer comes in glass mugs that are chilled in a freezer.  After getting our \"No thank you\" about dessert, the bill was not forthcoming.   Apparently, the bill might have magically appeared on a device on the table except we were seated in a table that was closed out in the computer.  I left a 20% tip only because 45 years ago, I had a similar job in high school and felt sorry for her.  I got the message.  This is Charlotte, the city of boozing millennials.  People like us are not wanted at Chili's.  The industry statistics about the bottom falling out at Chili's, Applebees et al confirm that large numbers of former customers also got the message.",
