The lamb was as flavorful as it was plentiful. Topped with just the right portions of tomatoes, onions and tzatziki, these gyros are unforgettable. Then add the authentic, homemade Greek dressing and there you have a complete, unparalleled sandwich. All three of my visits also included substantial portions of Greek french fries and a Greek side salad which concluded delicious, filling meals at a more than affordable price. The food was always backed by service that kept all facets of my visits at 5 stars. Unfortunately I live a couple hours away, but that won't keep me from coming back, nor should it keep you.",

I grew up working at a Greek restaurant in my youth and I feel I know what good Greek food tastes like. I had the Greek Stuffed hamburger steak and it was so good. It is a huge piece of hamburger steak filled with onions, green peppers, and feta cheese. It melts on the fork! I got the Greek fries with it and they just were delicious. Am I gushing about the place, you bet I am! The friends I was with had the marinated beef tips ans souvalaki and they were blown away too! The portion sizes were huge and the prices very affordable! My Greek Stuffed hamburger steak was like 7.95. The waiter was very courteous and friendly. We drove like 20 miles from our house in Fort Mill, SC on a tip we got from a neighbor and it was worth every mile! I cannot wait to go back again and try something else, like the BAKLAVA! As Homer Simpson would say,\"Baklava.....YUMMMMMMMMMM!\"!",

To begin with the tables, booths, fake plants and sagging ceiling tiles are any combination of worn out, dirty or sticky. The service is abysmal, at one point I was literally mid-sentence telling the waiter something and she just walked off.   The \"rotisserie\" lamb is actually browned in a pan, and it makes for some soggy meat. And careful for what you order, it's likely to be called a gyro and end up being meat in some store bought pitas with absolutely nothing else on it.   The \"Greek\" fries had a few flakes of dried oregano on them and the salad was nothing special, especially the styrofoam tomatoes.   And for some reason the sides are all American fare, fried okra, cole slaw...not sure why there isn't anything greek about it.",

    "text": "I came to Athenian wanting Turkish coffee (or Greek, if you'd rather); instead, I left with my heart won over by Chicken Salad Pita and its lip-smacking, chunky self... not to mention Chef's Special Fried Cheesecake -- its delicate filo and sweet syrups still on my tongue. And though that coffee was a no-show (not sold here!), I heard I could dine with a wine or two next visit. I'll keep that in mind when I'm in the mood to undo some Grape Leaves or get nice and intimate with a Chicken Souvlaki Platter one evening.  I was serviced well here. Wave upon wave of full-bodied flavor. Moreover, the atmosphere was full of energy... patrons having at it here and there, everywhere... whether it be Horiatiki or Lamb Gyro or Baklava. All for relatively cheap.  Any innuendos aside, Indian Trail has a solid Greek eatery up its alley. Yet with an ever present crowd already in on the action, I doubt there are many who've yet to hear just how good Athenian is. I'm already dreaming about my next visit...  FYI -- (1) free WiFi available; (2) again, no Turkish/Greek/Arabic coffee here; (3) not surprisingly, no hookah here; (4) outdoor dining available; (5) best tzatziki in the area; (6) AMEX NOT ACCEPTED!  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.25 - Food taste and quality = 3.5 (nothing on their menu's formulaically bland, despite \"what-the-heck\" items like BBQ Wings or Shrimp Po' Boy) - Portion size = 4 - Price = 4.75 (compared to Greek eatery prices I'm used to seeing, the fact that 100% of the menu is below $8 amazes me...) - Atmosphere = 4.5 (I hung around studying all afternoon, and the place was at least half full at all times... great music too!) - General service = 4.75 (my waitress Amber killed it -- in a good way of course) - Waitstaff = 5 - Location = 4 (nice, visible area... abundant parking)",

We prefer it over several other local Greek Restaurants in the area.  It's more authentic overall and frankly tastes better.  One of my favorites is the burger stuffed with w/feta, onions and peppers.  The Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) are the bomb and the best I've ever tasted.  I just wish they had Moussakka.  The owner truly cares about making his patrons happy.  The didn't serve decaf coffee so my husband requested it a couple of times and then wrote it on the back of his check & the next time we visited it was available.  We hope they stay around for a long long time - they're a part of our family tradition.",

The establishment is rather small but cutely decorated with Greek-inspired artifacts. A young host greeted me and showed me where to place my take-out order. The menu has all of the popular traditional Greek items, from gyro pitas to greek salads to souvlaki. I am a shrimp lover and chose a grilled shrimp pita, no veggies. The host-turned-server suggested the fries for my side so I went with it.   I didn't open the box on my way back to the office but the aroma coming from it was wonderful. When I finally opened the box back at the office, I was astonished at the portion size for less than $8. My pita was LOADED with grilled shrimp. I was expecting maybe 5, 8 if I was lucky. The tzatziki was delicious although next time I will ask them to go a little lighter on it. I see why he suggested fries! I was determined not to even eat them but once I saw them, I tasted one...then two. Ok....I probably ate about 10. No idea what the seasoning was on them but it was awesome.   Above all, the sanitation rating was 99.5.   Great food, fast service and friendly staff help this spot get 5 stars from me!",

The Greek seasoning was not bad, it just didn't add much flavor. Really, a minor complaint. Wanted it to be special like the rest of the meal!  Waitress was friendly and didn't make any mistakes. Prices were very affordable.   The baklava wasn't one of my favorites (it's my second favorite dessert overall so I'm picky) as it was slightly dry and not as nutty or flavorful as others I've had. It was the largest piece I've ever seen but it was also expensive for the size ($3+).   I'm new to the area so this was my first try to find a non-chain restaurant for a fast casual style meal. But, with those minor issues aside, it still earns top marks and will be my go-to gyro place from here out.",

Our order was incorrect; we had asked for a salad with no cucumbers, and they made a mistake. We asked them for a fresh salad, and they quickly returned. We asked the waiter directly if \"they had just picked off the cucumbers be brought it back\". He said no, but the first bite of salad had several cucumbers. He admitted he'd lied.    We asked to see the manager several times, and he never appeared. Highly disappointed; I get that his staff was inexperienced, but he's unable to manage his front of house, then he needs to get someone he can trust.",

The pitas come without lettuce, which is a first for me after visiting many Greek restaurants, and they won't do any customization to their food. Ordering a pita with half one kind of meat and half another is just not something in the realm of what they are willing to do. The dolmades were served chilled with no ground beef inside.... Another first for me. Atmosphere was pleasant and the staff was friendly. The small soda for the cost was a bit outrageous... Better off getting a beer instead. Edit: Downgraded from 2 star to one star after learning that my mother in law asked for a glass of ice 4 times before getting it served to her at the end of her meal... Let's bring a little Greek grill here to show them the right way it's done!",

    "text": "Typical Greek restaurant, which is a good thing because when it comes to Greek joints, \"typical\" means lotsa good food for the money,  friendly, attentive service and pride of ownership. It  doesn't have the most exciting atmosphere (also typical) or located in the most appealing area (a storefront) but let's face it, who really cares? Not the faithful regulars that love this place.   The menu includes the usual array of gyros, souvlaki, burgers, salads and desserts. I went with the Chicken Gyro with hand-cut Greek fries. The pita bread was perfectly browned and loaded with an ample supply of tender chicken, tomatoes and Tsuziki sauce. The Greek fries were a little too soggy for me, while the normal fries were quite good.   My wife tried the Chicken Souvlaki platter. It came loaded with the same delicious tender chicken, Greek salad and a mountain of fried okra, all of which was pretty good.  Everything else was okay too, especially their sanitation grade of 100! Definitely worth a try but just short of  Gotta Try. Personally though, we'll be back.",

We both chose the Athens Gyro Platter generous serving of meat with a side salad and additional choice of side.  Was a bit surprised to see the gyro was only meat on the pita but perhaps that was because it was served with a salad? Friendly, welcoming staff.  Fast service too.",

I was expecting something delicious with feta, well It was dry with no flavor, my son had a hamburger also that was dry, the fries had no flavor and under cooked, the the fried cheesecake was good but it was mostly outside crust with no cheesecake filling.  It's good to try a place once which I did and others may like it. Maybe the Greek food would be better. I wasn't impressed especially for what I paid.",

    "text": "In Indian Trail for a basketball tournament, I quick checked Yelp for nearby good restaurants and picked this unpretentious little Greek restaurant for dinner just one short mile away. Since we're down here most weekends I consider this a great new find!  First, this place is ridiculously affordable.  My dinner was $7.95!  Second it's got an overall 4.5 star rating for good reason. Third, our server Quinn was a delight. Helpful throughout, he was pleased to give recommendations when I accepted his offer (who else knows the food as well as the employees?)  I went with his favorite, the Athens Gyro Platter which was gyro (lamb, I'd imagine) meat on a pita with a side of delicious tzatziki, Greek salad and my choice of side. Quinn had mentioned earlier that the fries were seasoned with the same Greek seasonings as the wings so I tried them... yum!!!!!  I'd never get plain fries again. $7.95  My husband went with the chicken pita which was grilled chicken, tomatoes, onions, tzatziki and also chose the fries. $6.25  I also ordered the Horiatiki Village Greek Salad as an appetizer to share which is a lettuce-less salad of tomato, cucumber, red onion, green peppers, feta, black olives and three dolmades which are rice-stuffed grape leaves. I've had them before when they are super-piquant and these were happily a little less so which meant my husband enjoyed them also. Plus it came with warm pita triangles which were just yummy. $6.55  We tried the baklava (the only thing I forgot to take a picture of but someone else did) and it was warm!!  Absolutely delicious and only $3.25!!!   All the servers checked in on us at least once. Quinn was great. I wish we had this place up at Lake Norman but since we don't I'll have to come back on some future tournament weekends. Two thumbs up!!",
