But since I moved I hadn't been in years and the only reason I did go back was so my nephews could have breakfast with Santa before Xmas.  I have to say it wasn't too bad.  It was a buffet for like $15 pp and that included a non alcoholic beverage.  Our server was really great and she even offered to take pics of our whole fam for us.  The food was very decent for a buffet, lots of fresh fruit, biscuits, pancakes, eggs.    Santa was a little different then what we've seen elsewhere, my 3 y/o nephew had no issues with him but the 6 y/o was like uh uh, that looks nothing like Santa I don't want to sit on his lap, ouch!!  Overall I have never left Red Rocks and thought, wow what an amazing meal, but on the other hand I have also never left and though, ew that was awful.",

She is the epitome of customer service.  It could be months since my last dining experience and she ALWAYS remembers my name, greets with a smile, and usually a hug.    The menu has a broad range of offerings.  The chicken salad is very good as is the Reuben (corned beef or turkey).  Those are my usual go-to choices but I have ventured to other dishes and never been disappointed.  Their desserts are quite good, especially the coconut cake.  It can get a little noisy at times but there is plenty of seating indoors and on the patios.  The restaurant is always clean, as are the restrooms (very important), and the service is always friendly.  Staff has always been attentive, well-groomed, and professional.",

With as little enthusiasm possible, one led us to a spartan, outdoor area, enclosed by a tent, with heat lamps, on a cold rainy day. We were one of two tables and then alone in the sad room. Did she offer us another option when we showed obvious dismay, of course not. That being said, our server did offer any other table in the outdoor area, but nothing inside. Food just ok. Server never came back to get our credit card, had to bring it in to a manager. On our way out we passed what had to be a manager, some guy in suit and tie at the hostess stand inputting something really important into the computer. \"Hey folks, thanks\" ahhhh NO, not a word to us, not even a glance to say goodbye and thank you. Didn't even look up from the computer. Never going back.",

It's the type of place that feels quiet while you're there, yet you feel like you can speak in a normal voice without the booth next to yours being disturbed.    I've had the Kobe burger, crab cakes and the chicken salad sandwich.  The Kobe burger sells for only 10.99 or so, and is well worth the price.  Kobe beef makes for a pretty fantastic fancy-urger.   The crab cakes were pretty good.  Not too dry, but the seasoning and sauces overpowered the meat.  But it's tough to do shellfish right so far from their harvest point, and at the price they sell it at Red Rock.  So the additives probably did a good job to mask a mediocre flavor. The chicken salad sandwich was a chicken salad sandwich.  I probably wouldn't get that again for the 8.99 I paid.    Their beer selection isn't fantastic.  But they do have some good staples.  Yuengling, Guiness, Blue Moon and a light lager of some type fill their taps.  Pretty standard.    I'd probably not eat here if it weren't so close to my home.  But as it is, I've partaken a couple times and felt both times that the food and atmosphere was worth the price.",

I'm a salad person and all of their salads are wonderful. We recently had a visitor from out of town and of course we took him to Red Rocks. It was the perfect venue. We ate out of doors on their new patio. It was the perfect place to take someone we hadn't seen in years. We especially like Dante the manager.

We were disappointed not to have gotten a booth as they are way more spacious ---had a tiny little table against a wall and very cramped during the entire lunch. I have no issues myself with the food---I ordered a pasta dish, chicken and penne in a four cheese sauce with mushrooms and tomatoes. It was very tasty. My friend ordered a Kobe beef burger and had asked the server if she could substitute the soup of the day , broccoli and cheese, for a side. The server was glad to oblige and said sure you can. So her meal arrives and on the plate is a cup of chicken noodle soup instead. My friend summons the waitress and says \"I did order the broccoli cheese, did I not?\". She responds, Oh, they ran out!  Now folks, don't you think it would have been prudent to tell my friend beforehand that the soup she wanted was gone and not just bring any old thing?  So, the server does ask if you want to take it back and get something else. By that time , the other food was getting cold and she told her to not bother. Here is the kicker, though---when the bill arrived , she was charged $2.00 for the soup!! Why the server did not alert her before hand as to the extra charge, I can't imagine but she did have an obligation to say something. Rather than complain again , she decided to say nothing and pay for it. Wrong!! I wanted to make mention of this to the server and the management.  Not good business people , bringing out a food item you did not want in the first place and then charging you for it. You can do better than that, I am sure.",

There is a Little know parking deck in the block behind the cafe so no need to pay a valet, he is going to park your car there anyway.  The atmosphere is very laid back.  We went as a group.  The client tell is made up of a lot of locals on dates and the last time there we were graced by the presence of Daryl Waltrip and his entourage.  It was a nice evening and no it was not a madhouse.  Just business as usual.  Both nights I had the Fletwood's Sesame Tuna cooked rare.  an 8oz. sesame seared yellow fin tuna over wild rice risotto with asparagus finished with a ginger teriyaki broth.  Magnificent!  The drinks have a good amount of alcohol in them, the wine selection is very good and they have a very good selection of beer.  The only thing I would change are the outdoor chairs.  They need to be a little wider.  The wait staff are very nice and friendly.  Both our servers talked with us for a good amount of time between customers.  There are plenty of seats inside.  The bar area is designed for people to stand and talk as well as sit and eat.  Great transition between the cafe, bar area and main restaurant.  Not much I would change here.  If you are in the area check it out.  You feel like you are on a real main street.  And of course there are plenty of beautiful women to keep the conversation going.  I love the south!",

My dish was a calamari app which was different than most, strips with a nicely seasoned breading, fried greaselessly, and served with a very nice marinara.  Common bar fare very well executed.  My entree was copper river salmon, very nicely seasoned and cooked as requested to medium rare. A very generous fillet, clearly very fresh, and needing very little adornment. It was served with an interesting rice dish -  a sort of Mexican rice that was very sweet (almost dessert-like) yet also very spicy. Different, but it worked.  Wish they had a better beer selection as they just have crap on tap and the usual generic stuff in bottles. But all in all a very nice stop, and the menu is vast. Hopefully they do it all well. I will go back to try more.",

The kid menu ditto.  Out waitress, Cheryl, was so accommodating and on top of things that the meal became a friendly experience.  It took quite awhile to get our food, but it did come and was hot and correct.  The side salad was generous and we were glad that we ordered one to split.  The cajun chicken pasta, which I substituted shrimp, was in a spicy cream sauce and I was delighted to finish all of it.  Gosh was that good!  Wife had a spinach walnut ravioli which she liked enough to have wanted a larger portion.  Perhaps the dinner portion is more generous?  Although not a desert eater, granddaughter asked for key lime pie, selecting from one of those most dangerous trays containing at least six waist killing items.  Apparently they are known for their cakes, pies and pastries.  And now we know why.  The Military Officers Association of America frequently has meeting/dinners here and I think I will start attending.  It is a comfortable, classy, yet casual place for great lunches and dinners.",

We sat outside on the patio, where we received excellent service from both of the waitresses outside. The manager even came around twice. I ordered a glass of Moscato, which arrived in a big, tall wine glass. Very refreshing. My friends were pleased with their mixed drinks.   The menu is large, and a bit overwhelming for those who have never been. For my meal, I ordered Chet Snow's Salmon. I was able to substitute garlic smashed potatoes for the wild rice with no problem. The dish came out beautifully. The salmon was placed upon the garlic smashed potatoes with the lemon dill sauce on top of the salmon. The green beans were placed to the side. The salmon was cooked very well, with a slight crust all around, but still tender inside. The lemon dill sauce complimented the salmon very well. The garlic smashed potatoes were excellent-not too salty or garlic-y. The green beans had been blanched I believe; they were bright green and cooked, but still retained that firm bite when you crunched into them.   Overall, the next time I'm in Charlotte, I wouldn't mind returning to Red Rocks Cafe.",

    "text": "Red Rocks Cafe, nestled in South Park, offers an extensive menu of upscale American cuisine. The ambiance at Red Rocks is posh, yet relaxed and welcoming to families. I adore dining alfresco, and Red Rocks has a beautiful patio that allows their patrons to enjoy the southern weather during the spring, summer and fall.  We got off to a great start as Red Rocks impressed the kids by giving them a pirate sticker activity set that kept them content as we browsed the menu selections.  Once we settled in we realized that our most difficult task of the night would be choosing the winning entree. In my mind there were about five that were major contenders. The menu options are seemingly endless, and they all sounded amazing. They offer everything from burgers and salads to surf and turf, with many unique treasures in between.  We decided to try the Scott Andrew's Crab Cake Sliders ($12) as an appetizer - they were perfectly seared with a tangy dill mustard sauce. Their light flavor and full texture were taste-bud pleasing. Even little hands wanted to try these pint sized appetizers (as you can see in the photo!).  I shared the Cesar salad ($5) with my husband and S. The lettuce was fresh and crisp and the portion was large enough to share, but there was too much dressing for my liking. This was just a preference issue for me - because S thought it was perfection. I'd recommend asking for it on the side if you are 'dressing sensitive' like me, because it was a great tasting dressing.  S wanted fettuccine alfredo - do you sense a theme here with her dinners? The kids menu only offered marinara pasta, but the waitress let us know that they could easily swap out the marinara for  alfredo, and S was content with her favorite cream sauced entree.  E tried their burger, as did I, and it was juicy and tender. His latest obsession is ketchup (aka life blood as we call it) and he enjoyed dunking each piece of burger and french fry into his favorite condiment. I appreciate a restaurant that offers entrees that the kids will eat - and not complain about! Dining out should be a fun experience and picky kids with limited menus can pose a problem, luckily there was no such problem at Red Rocks.  Our patient, and attentive waitress visited our table and explained their specials and tried to help me narrow my top five to just one. Ultimately I ended up ordering the Eugene Robinson's Shrimp and Scallop Fresco ($18). I'm a fan of seafood, artichoke and sun dried tomatoes, and together they were served up together as a savory medley. The entire dish was tasty, but the scallops were phenomenal.  Jim's take: I enjoyed the crab cake sliders and Cesar salad. For my entree, I settled on Barry Giller's Blackened Tuna Avocado ($23).  It featured two good sized portions of seared sushi grade tuna over a bed of red risotto, grilled asparagus, avocado, and pico de gallo.  The tuna was a little spicy (which is a good thing to me) and the accompaniments complemented it very well. For dessert we had the chocolate cake, which was three delicious layers of chocolate cake and frosting. This was a major crowd pleaser.  We didn't sample anything from the wine menu, but next time we visit without the kiddos I'll have to enjoy a glass of one of their many wines.  I was thoroughly impressed with the entire staff, one waitress even stopped by and asked if she could clean off the tidy tray that we bring with us everywhere that E had used. Our server was attentive and able to anticipate the needs (more napkins, don't put the drink in front of the baby etc.) of our family without fail. The restaurant was well appointed, clean and the bathrooms had the ever needed changing table in the women's room. Parking was a breeze and they take reservations (always a bonus when dining with the little ones).  Red Rocks Cafe has two locations, the one in South Park and then a second location in Huntersville in the Birkdale shopping center. You can like Red Rocks Cafe on Facebook, or follow them on Twitter.

    "text": "We went to Red Rocks for Mothers Day brunch.  We were surprised by the price fixed menu because the website had described more of a buffet which we found out was only for the Birkdale Village location.  Instead, for $35.00 we had a choice of salmon, prime rib, Chicken Marsala or crab cakes Benedict.  Since it was only 10:30 we opted for the Benedict while my son got the prime rib.  We received our entries before we were done with our soup and about 5 minutes after we ordered.  Obviously they were ready for a crowd as it was all done in advance.  Pancakes were cold and had a strange flavor- the plastic packet of syrup didn't exactly help.  The eggs were overcooked and the English muffin was hard as rock.  Ugh!  People were not happy and we watched three groups look at the menu and walk out.  Meanwhile, it seemed like there were a ton of managers around and they were all taking selfies!    If you have been to Red Rocks, you know how big their cake slices are.  Well, brunch came with cake but it was this little tiny square piece - like 2x2.    We felt totally ripped off.  We have always liked the place because of the outdoor seating but it will be a long time before we go back.  The bait and switch on the website was unforgivable.",

    "text": "I would give this place 3.5 stars.  My husband said it perfectly...it is like a glorified diner.  They sorta fall under the \"jack of all trades but master of none\" category.    We were here for Brunch last weekend and had a decent experience.  I wasn't wowed and I wasn't disgusted.  I think there are some things they do really, really well and then other things they could improve upon.  Their desserts for example are amazing (oreo cheesecake and key lime pie to name a couple).  But other items on the menu don't seem fresh or homemade...everyone loves their bacon salad dressing and their salads overall seem to be a hit.  I tried the steak and eggs meal and it was pretty good.  The steak was cooked well and it was rather juicy and tender...can't go wrong with that.  It was served with a hashbrown patty that was a nice addition to the meal.  Hubby tried the chicken pasta dish and it was decent.  The sauce was not bad but the chicken was pretty flavorless.  It was sorta like a rubber ducky heated up in the microwave and then slapped on the pasta.  It would have been better if it was marinated or cooked in lemon, oregano, garlic, basil, heck anything!    The service was decent...our waitress seemed a little disheveled but she was fine for the most part.  I used to work at Red Rocks in my waitressing days so I have a soft spot in my heart for them.  I only wish the best for them and I know they have a loyal following so they will do just fine!  I will be back and once you know what to order and what to avoid, you will have a good experience.",

They have a TV that plays a fish tank scene which is awesome. Their She-Crab soup is amazing and a must have.  All the menu items are named after local celebrities like Dell Curry and Steve Udelson which is a fun touch for the few of us Charlotte natives.  Side note, this restaurant seems to be a big hit with the senior citizen crowd. There were at least 5 tables filled with charming elderly women enjoying a little lunch.",

You're going nowhere because you're too convenient to ignore.   But today, I received a pleasant surprise. Ordered a dinner entree for lunch.

And although the presentation looked odd, and the fish was a bit overcooked, the flavors were excellent.   Bartender even pulled off great and friendly service. And, I do always love the greetings at the door. Like you're genuinely glad I'm there. Being an ex industry girl, I know you're staff has \"issues\" - but I didn't see it today, and I didn't taste it today.   So...kudos. And, yes, I'll be back.",

    "text": "I have been meaning to write a review for this place for awhile now.  My husband and I went for Valentine's day 2018 which was my first visit there.  I try to keep a neutral idea in my head when eating at an unfamiliar place and was I ever impressed!  We were originally seated on the patio where they had a thick plastic sheeting hanging over the sides of the roof.  It was cold but they had heaters which were working well except for the cold air blowing from the outside under the sheeting.  I'm a cold-natured person so this was just too much for me.  My husband told the staff who, after about only 3 minutes, reseated us inside.  I like an extremely dirty vodka martini before a good meal out and rarely does anyone get it right the first time (I usually tell the server to go ahead and bring more olive juice) but this bartender must have known what I meant when I told the server \"if I can see through it, it isn't dirty enough!\"  The service was excellent, food superb, and the coconut cake is to die for!  I noticed a couple dining there also who where were hearing impaired.  Red Rocks sent over a server who signed to them and I think even had a small conversation with them.  How many places do you know of that can offer such a great experience?!  Red Rocks Cafe is definitely on the top of my list of choices for great food and service in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Easter Brunch at Red Rocks Charlotte was fantastic. We made reservations for 11:45 and it was good that we did as the restaurant got pretty full. The brunch was buffet style, starting with breakfast items (bacon, scrambled eggs, pancakes, biscuits) and a salad. I didn't waste time with those! The remainder of the buffet included deviled eggs, garlic mashed potatoes, creamed corn, Mac n cheese, green beans (that were so delicious they cannot have been healthy!), four cheese pasta, lemon dill salmon, sliced ham, and a carving station for prime rib au jus. It was delicious and the price ($30) was reasonable.   The highlight, however, was the dessert table. Oh-Em-Gee. It was incredible. Cheesecake, assorted truffles, chocolate cake, carrot cake, tiramisu, banana pudding, berries n cream...amazing! I had not been to Red Rocks in awhile and this was a good reminder of why I used to go more frequently.",

However, it has been years since I have been back since I have moved and it is not right down the street, as it was in the past.  My Mom and arrived shortly after 5:30, an early dinner before a show, and were seated and approached for our drink order. After reviewing the menu, my Mom ordered the Crab Cake dinner and I chose the Crab Stuffed Trout special.  The crab cake was breading only with a little shredded crab and definitely overcooked.  As for the crab stuffed trout, very misleading. It was a piece of trout with a crab cake on top. And, as I said, the crab cake was ver disappointing.  The trout was cooked very swell, but missed seasoning that I actually had to add salt as I was eating. Both dishes were served with fresh veggies, really??? All raw. And mashed potatoes or rice. I had the potatoes, okay, and Mom had the rice, undercooked.  Overall the food was a complete disappointment and I would not return. However, our server, and I hate that I don't remember his name, was so nice and was on top of refreshing our water, offering us another drink and checking in throughout the evening.",

I have had quite a few different dishes, chicken marsala (my aunts favorite), burger, ravioli, but the one dish I always come back for is the cajun chicken pasta.  This has to be my favorite pasta anywhere!  Love the sauce, having chicken and sausage, vegetables, and of course cheese!  I've gotten to the point, that's all I can order, but they have plenty to choose from.  Kevin loves their saltimbucca!  My last visit earlier this month was with some girlfriends.  They asked about bread, and they offer it on an as ask for basis.  I've never asked for it, so it was news to me.  The bread is just as good as the rest of their food, it is very soft and light.  They of course have plenty of desserts.  I love the oreo cheesecake!  Overall, this is in my top 3 of favorites here, can't wait to go back soon!",

    "text": "This place has disappointed us a couple of times since the recent renovation.   The menu was changed, and not for the better, in my opinion.  But execution is where Red Rocks has gone downhill since the renovation.  Last night my steak was not cooked properly--too rare by far-- but I did not realize it until I had gotten past the edges of it and the server had already come by and inquired about it, and I had not indicated a problem, so I did not track down the server and send it back.   Probably should have anyway.   After two in a row disappointing steak entrees in my last two Post-renovation visits I will avoid ordering any steak here henceforth.  On the plus side, the service is always good, the desserts are outstanding, the wine list has you covered no matter what you want to spend, and the sides and the fish dishes are generally well-executed.  Salads and she-crab soup are always good as well.  I am not quite ready to give up on the place yet, but it has moved downward on our rotation due to these things.",

This meal tasted like you were visiting family that has not seen you in years and they cook all your favorites! I went back again on my last night in Charlotte, I didn't realize they were 10 minutes from closing. I felt horrible and was going to leave but everyone of the staff welcomed me in like I was their first customer of the day! This time I got the meatloaf w/ garlic mash and veggie medley. I've never had a more delicious meatloaf and it had marinara sauce instead of ketchup which I thought was AMAZING! The meat was so tender.. I finished my meal off with a piece of the most delicious and moist coconut cake I've ever had in my life! The thing that really stood out to me was the service was amazing & even 10 minutes before closing the meal tasted like they just opened. No sloppiness or leftover just throw on a plate so they could go home.",

If your looking for a recipe straight from low country itself, this bowl will not disappoint. They even add just the perfect touch of sherry. The menu is very large, plenty of choices for everyone. They are known for their desserts as well and don't let the price tag fool you......I ate on my piece of cake for probably four days!! I hope to see you soon Red Rocks!!",

    "text": "Red Rocks is always a hit for us. Seated quickly despite having a party of seven, Red Rocks did not disappoint. Our server was phenomenal. He was extremely attentive and responsive to our needs...it was almost as if he anticipated our needs.  I tried the cajun salmon for the first time. It was delicious. I was extremely surprised at the size of the filet; it was huge. I am not an asparagus fan so I substituted it for garlic mashed potatoes. I regretted that because I was in carb overload with those plus the risotto. But the salmon, risotto and few bites of the potatoes that I could stomach left no room for dessert. Not getting dessert at Red Rocks is an absolute sin. So I had to taste hubby's red velvet cake which was to die for. Our sons shared (it's massive) the five-layer chocolate cake. Always moist and decadent, the chocolate cake is a True choco-holic's dream. Our friends enjoyed their meals, too, and desserts ranging from ribeyes to lobster ravioli (delicious) and key lime pie and strawberry cheesecake. Once again, awesome experience!",

    "text": "Very Disappointed in this experience at red rocks on Friday night.   Our waiter Adam was excellent, however the music was way to loud, I asked twice for it to be turned down, I felt like constantly everyone including myself were trying to talk over the music, so we ended up having to move to the outside room.   The food came, the salmon was supposed to be plain with no seasoning/pepper as someone in my party has an allergy but came out and tasted like Cajun.   To be honest this is getting frustrating as food supposing to be plain has came out incorrectly 3 times within about 2 months.  I don't know why it can't just be plain? It is frustrating having to wait for something to be redone when it should have been right the first time.   I wish the music wasn't so loud and the salmon could have been right the first time, not sure if it was the kitchen or ?  Overall tonight's overall experience is a 2, lots of times it's been a 5/5. But tonight was a 2/5.  Update:  We went back to red rocks about 2 days ago and the manager took care of us.   The food was 5/5 and the experience was a 5/5. All the food was perfect with no pepper/seasoning and great!",

Very sedate.  We decided to eat at the bar so we could watch some baseball.  Our servers at the bar were very nice, but almost a little to enthusiastic (i.e.  listening to every word we said & chiming in).  But it's better than being ignored.  We both had the sea bass in two different preparations.  Livingston's Chilean Sea Bass over risotto w/asparagus & pineapple chutney, & Steve Urvan's Southern Citrus Sea Bass over Sweet Potato Fries topped w/Spinach & a Gran Marnier Buerre Blanc.  They were both cooked perfectly and were equally delicious.  I liked the Citrus one the best because the Sweet Potato Fries were lightly crispy & were cut short so everything fit on the fork & into your mouth in yummy bites.    The only issue with the dinners is mine came out piping hot on a \"please be careful it's hot\" plate, but sweetie's was only just warm - so it evidently sat for a while waiting for mine to be re-done?  Supposedly Red Rocks is known for their homemade desserts so we tried the something peanut butter bread pudding ---- it was not good.  Barely room temp, no flavor, hard, we both took one bite & sent it away.  They were nice & tried to interest us in another dessert, but we didn't feel like trying one after that.    We did let the manager know that it didn't ruin our experience with the rest of the food or the service & we would be back.",

My biggest complaint is that the red wine is always served too warm and I finally figured out why. They keep their bottles on top of the bar refrigerators. The heat from refrigerators warms the red wine enough that I usually have to put in an ice cube (not what I want to be doing.)   They now have a big beautiful outdoor seating area.",

Had a bowl of she crab soup and it was also full of crab and very rich, not really for me, but good. I had the wedge salad with filet medallions whic,h was very tasty!!! Would order this again. My husband had a cheesy pasta with chicken and tomatoes and some kind of bacon?? He thought it was very rich and creamy and would order again. Our 11 year old had the kids steak with mac, n cheese and enjoyed the meal.  We shared a lovely layerd chocolate cake which was very good. We were told that this cake was not made here, but it is still worth ordering.  We had an overall fantastic dining experience and will be back.",

I guess their \"tradition\", \"location\" or whatever sustains them.....certainly not food quality. I went to Red Rocks by choice about 10 years ago for the first (and last) time. Ten years later we went tonight for a group event. The \"second last time\" if you will. The She Crab soup tasted old and salty. The Rib Eye was about as low a cut and cooked with as little flavor as possible. At $25, not a good investment.  Usually I like to make reviews with motivational direction but apparently they don't need it if they survived the last recession without the need to improve quality. So I guess they deserve begrudging kudos in a way!",

When I had another waitress stop her from putting in my order because I wanted to add/change something, she visually was irritated making gestures you would expect from a 2 year old child who had a toy taken from them or you asked them to go to bed. I had never seen this in my life from a server I was truly shocked.  Her name was Christine. If you decide to go don't let her help you.  I called her out on this and of course lied and said the lady said something else but I totally caught her off guard.   The food was just ok nothing special or delicious to make me want to come back. Had I not had this experience I may have desired to go back and try another dish. I had salad and a fillet w/ mashed potatoes. I had to send my food back be sure it clearly wasn't cooked to the appropriate temperature. Then my sides got cold.   My friend that I was dining with had blackened tilapia and that was pretty good. But this service makes me never want to go there again. After all the server and the service you receive at a restaurant is very important. I eat out all the time. I consider myself to know what great service is. This was by far the worse.   I was really disappointed in Red Rocks. I was looking forward to a great experience. ; (",

    "text": "Like the restaurant, but had a bad experience last time. Got the ribs, which are extremely good, and ordered double slaw instead of fries. The slaw had turned rancid, quite bad, so I returned it. Waitress said chef was opening other slaw containers to see how wide spread the problem was, offered a different side. I picked Mac and cheese. It was really amateurish, not good at all, no reason to eat it. No apology for the rancid slaw, which would have been appropriate. So, today we went again. I wanted to try the ribs again, but looking at the sides, and of course leery of the two from the last meal, I gave up and had the chopped salad with filet, which was great. My observation is that some of the items on the menu seem dated and not up to the level of most of the menu. I recommend updating the sides and some of the appetizers, bring them up to the same quality as the rest of the menu.",

They were just unhappy that they didn't have a spoon to scrape up what was left of the sauce. But they managed to use fries from my salad for that. I normally get a hamburger or fillet sandwich but decided to get a salad. This one had London Broil and fries in it.  It was excellent.  ( Pittsburgh Salad ) The oriental dressing is perfect and always ask for their horseradish sauce to dip your fries in. This is one of my top five places in Charlotte to eat.  Never disappointed!!!",

The prices may seem a little pricey but the ingredients and their portions match up with the price. They have the same environment as any other high end restaurant but you don't pay big bucks for a kid size meal. Bartenders and waiters are always on point and very friendly. Don't leave without their chocolate cake!   Weatherly Cajun Salmon- HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Blackened Tuna- Nice thick slices  Lobster Ravioli- Very Rich & Creamy  Cajun Chicken on a Croissant All their steaks are great, whoever grills them up really know what they're doing, never had an under or over cooked steak.  Really great ranch dressing (For those who are like me that are really particular with Ranch)  Last night they have a Caramel Balsamic Reduction sauce that paired so well with their steak. *drooling as I type* Pittsburg Salad- Nothing better than an unhealthy salad!  Moscow Mule with extra lime- LOVE IT HERE",

Yesterday we tried Red Rocks and to our surprise they had crab cake and she crab soup on their menu. All restaurants say theirs is the best and in our opinion we agree with their boast. It was one of the best examples of crab entrees we have experienced. The soup had sherry wine on the top and the sandwich had little filler and made with quality parts. If you come here and like crab, these are a must. The sandwich is under $13 and the bowl is only $7. I also had the blackened chicken club sandwich and was very good offering a contrast in taste by using a honey mustard sauce. Service was very good and our waiter, Patrick, did a great job. Our only wish would be that the owner offer traditional calamari rather than trying to satisfy that need by offering julienned squid bodies rather than traditional calamari tentacles.",

    "text": "We've been to the location in Birkdale Village and really enjoyed it. We had been waiting for the reopening to go in for the lobster linguine and salad with buffalo chicken and of course their coconut cake. The only thing that didn't disappoint was the cake. Service was very slow and then the first bad news- no lobster linguine. Finally decided on the four cheese penne after a warning from the server about how cheesy it was, which was more like a selling point to us! Husband ordered a salad with the buffalo fried chicken and daughter ordered the Black ended shocker croissant.  About 15 min later the server comes out to say they have no croissants. He did not bring a menu just offered white or rye bread. She chose white but was bummed. At this time I asked if they could still try to make the lobster pasta but with angel hair pasta instead of linguine since I saw on the menu that they still had both lobster and angel hair pasta. After a long wait the server came back to say that no that couldn't because they don't have lobster or linguine. Even though they have two other dishes on the menu with lobster and angel hair pasta o just dropped it. But was annoyed. Then the food came- there was NO cheese in my cheese sauce, only the light sprinkle of cheese on top. Disappointing. The buffalo sauce on my husband's salad was SWEET. Another bummer.  The worst though was when the bill came and I was upcharged $2 for shrimp and husband $1 for buffalo sauce. However if were nickel and diming-  o credit for my daughter's missing croissant! Another dish had a $1 upcharge for shrimp so it seemed odd to be overcharged for the same. And then to charge for buffalo sauce? That just came across very cheap.  We'll definitely give this place plenty of time for the new staff to get up to speed before returning or maybe just forego this location altogether and go to birkdale village instead.",

A friendly African-American staff member working at the dessert bar was real helpful in telling me good dishes to choose from and dessert with pricing.  The desserts were thick and priced at about $8.  My order didn't take long at all. The atmosphere was 70s tunes and red dim lights in random spots. I asked for garlic bread with my meal and the bartender said it wasn't a problem.  Unfortunately, I found my Lobster Linguini to be quite bland. I was expecting some seasonings that complimented the lobster instead of relying on the taste of Alfredo sauce.  I do have about 3-4 servings for the money.  I'd like to visit again and try dessert but I see at lot of reviews of blandness of the dishes.",

To come back with family after all these years and see that all those qualities have been kept intact speaks for itself. This is a local restaurant that I'm so happy Charlotte has!

    "text": "Time for a review update!!  3.5 stars.  I like this place, don't get me wrong...but the lunch I had the other day wasn't my favorite.  A few things on their menu are just missing something.  I had the spinach walnut ravioli and it was the lunch portion.  Tons of spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms..with hardly any ravioli.  That's ok, it's lunch, I get it.  The flavor was a little off. It was just too bland for me.  The sauce didn't have much flavor at all and the tomatoes weren't very good.  The she crab soup was yummy. The flavor was nice and I did enjoy it.  There were a few shells...but nothing crazy.  I wish I would've gotten the lobster ravioli.  Once I find something I like, I should probably just stick with it.  Lesson for next time.  I will be back.  I'd like to try some of their apps and maybe dessert.  The people are really nice and the service was perfect.  There was no wait at lunchtime, which is appreciated by many on their lunch hour.",

I had the Asian salad which was good but a little boring. It definitely needs more crunch like little wonton strips. I would come back here and try some other things.",

They took my steak back to cook it some more and way overcooked it, way past well done, ruined. The mashed potatoes were plain and dry, the blue cheese was soaked in blood on my plate, the asparagus was plain and very woody.  Even the horseradish sauce had a funky aftertaste and no bite so plain! From our experience today the quality of Red Rocks is way down and will be a long time making the list of all the fine restaurants in Charlotte to dine! So to be fair..... Another in our party had a pasta dish that was really good. Then yet another really loved his salmon.  I'm not sure what one had but he ate every bite.",

It's behind the Strawberry Hill apartments and you can also reach their parking lot from them in the event you accidentally turn into the apartments.   The decor of the place provides a steakhouse feel, but the service was more personal like a local mom and pop shop. The wine list was extensive and was reasonably priced by the glass, but be careful... those prices add up real fast!   Our food was well seasoned and spicy where indicated. The menu is larger than most places near the Southpark area so take your time. Not that you'll be rushed but this place has a lot to offer. I ordered so much food that I wasn't able to order a dessert but based on the Yelp photos... I will be making my way back here for a wine and dessert night!",

I had the she-crab soup , good flavor but minimal crab meat, and there were bits of shell.  I also had the crab cake, not even close to lump crab, was pan fried with oil vs butter, was supposed to be on brioche bun and was served on a hamburger bun, and it contained bits of shell. The only star was the sides, broccoli and cauliflower, which were flavorful  and cooked perfectly.  Service was also sub-par, I was at the bar and the bartender seemed angry about something and was perfunctorily polite but not friendly. Lot's of locals love it , I guess they remember your name, but I prefer to have good food - I'm staying away.",

After we ate, individual bills came out immediately. It was almost the fastest service I've seen.  My salmon salad was good. It wasn't outstanding, but it was good. The noise level inside the restaurant was a bit much, but not impassive to chat.  Even though I try hard to not eat desserts, I know that they offer a wide selection of yummy desserts.  They also have areas that they can block off for larger groups, so the restaurant is really good for groups of people.  Getting into and out of the parking lot at the Strawberry Hills Shopping Center is not the easiest thing with all of the construction going on.  Even before the construction, I never really liked the parking lot. But with that said,  Red Rocks is a solid choice for restaurants in the general South Park area.

I've eaten and restaurants all over the world and Red Rocks is still a very unique special place. Very friendly and  a lot of regulars consistently dine there. I had lunch there last week. The experience was absolutely fantabulous. Our waitress' name was Leanne. She did her job extremely well. She paid close attention to detail, was very attentive and proficient, made suggestions and new the specials well. She made the experience very enjoyable.

The staff was courteous and attentive to everything we asked, not to mention patient and playful with our 3 and 4 year olds (more on that later).  We started with the calamari appetizer. These were not your typical overly-breaded thin slices of greasy squid. These were hearty tender chunks with a pleasantly seasoned and crispy coating that worked perfectly with the moderately spicy buffalo sauce. Also started with a cup of the she-crab soup which was absolutely delicious and luxuriously velvety. For her main course, my wife ordered the blackened seafood salad which she describes as the best salad she's ever had (not including my grilled homemade Caesar of course). I ordered the Jambalaya and was very pleased with the results. First, it was of the red variety and, secondly, the dish incorporated more of the red sauce than you typically see in many Jambalaya dishes. This application included the perfect ratio of sauce to dirty rice, ensuring no bite was mealy, clumpy, or dry. The vegetables were al dente and the shrimp was cooked perfectly until just done. One of the best I've had myself.  To finish the meal, our daughter asked for chocolate cake and when it came to the table with raspberry syrup flower decorations around the plate, it was like she saw a unicorn lol. In all honesty, the cake was delicious as well.  I found no flaws at any point in our meal and the staff went out of their way to bring a smile to the kids' faces as we were leaving by showering them with more stickers for their activity books.   What else can I say? If I lived here, I'd be eating at Red Rocks Cafe very frequently. Do yourself a solid and get a great meal at a very reasonable price.",

The entire meal was a parade of servers and hostesses stopping by to loudly chat and make plans and talk about other guests.

And, a handful of my friends really like it. So, here we are. Lunch at Red Rocks. Again.   My go-to order is the chicken salad and fruit plate. Their chicken salad is pretty tasty, all white meat. They bill the fruit as seasonal but it has always been the same mix of melon, pineapple, grapes and berries when I get it.   On my latest visit, I decided to branch out and try something new. I ordered the blackened chicken club croissant. I should have stuck with my usual. The croissant was soggy, I guess from the juicy chicken, and the bottom disintegrated in my hands at the first bite. In hopes of salvaging the dish, I peeled the croissant off and ate the chicken/cheese/lettuce/tomato/bacon with a knife and fork.   While I'll probably lobby to go some place else when the \"where should we go for lunch\" convo comes up at the office, odds are I'll loose that battle and be back again soon. I'm coming to terms with the fact that it's pretty unavoidable.",

The fish was cooked well, and the asparagus was perfect, not mushy-a good bite.  My dining companion had tenderloin Medallions with blue cheese crumbles--it came with fresh veggies and also the risotto.  Overall, OK.  Th Grouper was the winner tonight.

We asked for recommendations from the bartenders and they advised on the surf-n-turf special for $27. Great deal which included two 3 oz. center cut filet medallions, lobster Mac-n-cheese and sauteed spinach. It was an excellent choice, the food came out pretty quickly. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was in the top three. We had several rounds of drinks and they were great as well. Then, they brought out the dessert tray  They were huge portions and all looked delicious. We got the coconut cake and split it. That had to be the most delicious coconut cake I've ever had and it's my favorite dessert. The restaurant wasn't too loud, we could comfortably have a conversation at the bar. Highly recommend this place, we met a local who frequented there and gave it high marks as well. Worth checking it out.",

I chose this restaurant because I've had such wonderful experiences with the location in birkdale. Casual atmosphere from jeans to dresses. Appeared to be kid friendly as there were families with small children. In fact the family next to our table had a server who interacted with the kids and kept them laughing which I'm sure those parents appreciated.  I'm giving 4 not 5 stars with hopes of returning when it's not restaurant week. The selection for the menu was great but I chose the coconut salmon with risotto and asparagus and I wasn't impressed. I LOVE salmon and I would not order this again. It wasn't bad but there certainly wasn't anything special about it. My sister had shecrab soup for an appetizer and that was delicious. I had the kale salad which was outstanding. Oh the chocolate cake....mmmmmm.  No complaints on the cocktails either!",

The food just isn't what it used to be albeit the menu is the same.  My daughter (23 yrs old) ordered spinach ravioli with chicken.  What she got was a soup with some ravioli in it.  It wasn't a sauce as you would expect, it looked like it was in chicken broth.  After she ate a few bites she said she didn't see any chicken, so we flagged the waiter since he hadn't come back to check on the food.  He apologized and went to the kitchen to get the chicken.  He comes out with a some chicken chunks on a small plate and said it was sitting there already prepared, they just forgot to put it in the ravioli.  Strike 1.  My wife ordered lobster ravioli.  It was bland tasting and anemic looking.  Strike 2.  We were there celebrating my daughters birthday.  When it came to desert, the waiter said went through the choices and also offered a complimentary pc for the birthday girl.  She said ok she'll have that and then he says they no longer have complimentary cake.  This was 1 minute after he said they did.  There were 4 of us at the table, we all heard it.  Strike 3.  Not surprising, there wasn't an adjustment on the bill for the late cold chicken either.",

It was very rich, and delicious), and every item I've gotten there has ranged in quality from good to gourmet.  The crab cakes, for example, were pretty tasty, if not out of this world, and they were accompanied by simple fresh vegetables.  If you have a bigger stomach than me, or if you're just prowling around for dessert, you should try their desserts.  I say this not because I have (I'm always too full) but because they _look_ very good, and I've often read that they have some of the best desserts in Charlotte.  Decor is nice.  I almost feel bad going in there in t-shirt and jeans... but not so bad that I stop.  Service is good, and very helpful (\"I've never had She Crab soup\" and she brought out a small sample).  In fact, the one reason I don't go there more often is that their prices are a bit on the high side.  I think Yelp's price range system fails here: I would typically go to restaurants rated \"$$,\" but since it says \"$$$\" is more than $31/person, I have to put Red Rocks in the \"$$\" category.

Try the pastas dishes, filet mignon, and seafood. They have a huge patio to eat on and the atmosphere inside and out is terrific- upscale without being pretentious. Ask for Ann Marie or Jenny. You will leave happy.",

I was SO impressed with how beautiful the dining room was set up - not only did they have the tables beautifully decorated, but there was a Christmas tree and fireplace - absolutely gorgeous! I felt that the price was the best that I could find for what we were aiming to do - a lot of restaurants charge an arm and a leg to reserve, but I felt that Red Rocks was VERY fair with the price. The staff was absolutely phenomenal. I was impressed with the waiter and waitress who were able to keep every person's order as we mingled. The food also came out super fast! If you are looking for a restaurant for your event, Red Rocks is a MUST! I will definitely be returning for events that I organize. I'm so grateful that Red Rocks helped create such a stress free and memorable surprise 40th anniversary for my parents, family, and friends!",

I've never been WOWed....except for the size of the desserts that are presented after the meal. Dang, that's some big cake. Plenty of vegetarian-friendly options, and for the carnivorous, there's the obscene Tom's Pittsburgh Salad, topped with London broil and fries.  It's a popular spot for folks a generation (or two) older than myself, and I can see why. Chili's wishes it were the staple that Red Rocks is for the Strawberry Hill area.  Service is fine, not overbearing...and they can tell that if you're coming in for lunch (or dinner, for that matter), you're not in a great hurry.   Oh, and right now, they have a Yelp check-in deal for 10% off your meal. That's definitely in their favor.  Red Rocks is often a choice for people working in my office or living in the vicinity, so I end up there more often than I'd rather. All in all, it doesn't disappoint.",

    "text": "In February, husband and I had a disappointing visit to Red Rocks and had the opportunity to try again.  The revisit is why I like giving restaurants a second chance as long as they're not super-scary bad (which Red Rocks wasn't at all; we just found it disappointing for a variety of reasons). Any restaurant can have an off night, especially when it's crowded for a holiday.   This time we started with the spinach queso dip, which was delicious. I chose another steak, this time a center-cut sirloin, while my husband had the kobe burger. He also enjoyed two cocktails, which I cannot remember but he liked very much. The food was much more flavorful, the meat cooked to order, and the service spot on. As before, the dessert was splendid (carrot cake for me, Oreo cheesecake for him), and we were comfortable and well attended throughout the meal.  Thank you to the owners of RR for inviting us back. We would be happy to return now and have marked RR as one of our go-to spots.",

Upon asking the hostess if I could sit and work prior to the meeting she gave me the dark bar as an only option. I was about the only person in the place. When asked if I could have a table outside instead she advised me that \"they really didn't like that unless I were ordering\". After I offered to leave she gave me a table on the empty patio. Once there I felt pressured to order food so I ended up eating my meal prior to my colleagues arriving. My waitress was very nice and my salad fine. The menu seemed over-priced for the area. Once my colleagues arrived at noon there was still no one else but me on the patio. I really don't understand why the hostess made a fuss about it. I moved to where my colleagues had a table inside and met with them while they ate. It was noisy and felt awkward having already eaten. Based on my experience with the hostess and possibly the prices, I don't know if I would come back here.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Red Rocks many times & find the food to be good but the service really can be hit or miss.  I have been on several occasions for dinner meetings, and the wait-staff for special events are normally on top of things.   On my last visit, we went in around 8:30 or 9 PM  to have beverages & appetizers. Now, Red Rocks would not normally be my first choice as a place to go just for drinks & appetizers... however, I had friends from out of town staying close by and they really like wine rather than beer or mixed drinks... so this was the closest place to them that offered a decent selection of wines by the glass.   Since we had a group of between 8 - 10 people, we told them that we didn't really want to eat dinner, but would like a table so we could order appetizers and drinks. The waiter assigned to our table was apparently not happy that we were not all ordering dinner (but, as it turned out, a couple of people in our party did order full meals).   But,  the service was the worst I have ever seen, and our server even left in the middle of his shift  and handed off our table to another server.  (Thankfully, she was much more gracious and attentive).   The appetizers were good -- we had the Artichoke & Crab Dip, Queso Spinach Dip, Buffalo shrimp and the guys ordered the Kobe sliders.  As usual, the quality of the food was good... I just wish the service had been better.",

We made a reservation, we were told they were 10 minutes behind, but more like 20 minutes was our wait (This was ok and expected for a Saturday night).  We were then seated on their 'enclosed' patio, which is not a place to sit people when it's 28 degrees outside.  The very cold air still seeped into the room (Feet were freezing!), and the heat lamps were not at every table.  As far as the tables go, I could have gone to my garage and had the same experience.  We ordered the steak, my food was delicious but my wife's steak had to be sent back twice as it was still not cooked to order.  By the time she had her meal cooked to order she was ready to go.  While this was our first time at this location, the one in Birkdale has never disappointed.  We will not be attending the Providence road location again.    First impressions are everything, please do not sit your customers on your patio during winter, it's very warehouse looking and does not make for a romantic dinner for this time of year.  Unless you like to be cold, sit on lawn furniture and see expose cables and wires everywhere.",

Strangely the entrees have been forgettable to me, the best options are probably too expensive for me to try. :-) Atmosphere is dim and intimate, great for couples.

I even questioned the server if it was really risotto - perhaps I got the wrong side.   He assured me it was.  Poorly prepared if it was.   When he took my plate he asked how it was and agreed \"it is kinda mushy\".   The service was good - the only reason I give it 3 stars.

Comfort food, Italian food, seafood, vegetarian, lots of salads, and even some pretty casual, but fancy sandwiches.  The atmosphere is nice. It's fancy enough so that I feel inclined to wear a dress instead of yoga pants, ha. I love the drum shade lighting and all the booths. I just wish the decor had a little more personality, to give it less of a \"chain restaurant\" look.  The smartest thing the owners do is entice you with dessert before you even eat, by having all their fresh baked good on display as you enter. Remember how good those look as you walked in, but you're too stuffed to have anything else now? Good luck with that will power... After you finish your meal, the waiters bring out a tray with a slice of each cake on display. They describe in detail each piece. Yeah, I can never resist. So I usually get a piece to take home.  My favorite dishes here?  Appetizers: Parmesan Potato Cakes, Queso-Spinach Dip, and the Homemade Potato chips. I guarantee you won't be disappointed by any of these!   Salad: Small Baby Field Greens (pine nuts, goat cheese and craisins.. YES!)  Pastas: Walnut and Spinach Ravioli, and Quarto Fromaggio Penne (minus the meat of course)  Sandwiches: Portabella Mushroom Melt  FYI: It's much nicer and quieter here on a week day/night. Sometimes the weekends can be crowded and annoying.   Would probably come here more if the prices were just a bit lower.",

However the food that my friend and I ordered weren't that great. It tasted generic noting special. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. I just think overall the experience was average as well as the food.",

Today we asked if Red Rocks is LGBT friendly in view of the Legislature's recent law passed to legalize discrimination. We wanted to to ensure the comfort of all our diners and got a resounding \"yes, of course!\" Stephanie took care of us today and was friendly and efficient, delivering extra salad dressings and drink refills without us asking.  The food is always fresh and generous in size too. We've never been disappointed so we will be back, probably next Sunday!",

I was disappointed that they don't have a lunch menu - unless you want to pay $20-$40 for lunch, at least 1/3 of the menu was off limits.   BUT, to offset my disappointment, I had the key lime pie and it was wow in my mouth. I could taste the freshly zested lime. It was basically perfection in a slice.",

He allowed the table set up for us to keep the previous customers seated even after their bills were paid and service finished. He didn't ask them to leave, saying the table was needed for other customers. When reservations were made (much) earlier in the day, we were informed that the patio might be available and it was heated. The manager never asked us if we wanted the patio so we assumed it was closed. We won't be coming back any time soon - if at all. I will be writing up a review on Yelp/Charlotte. A most unfortunate evening and a loss of 12 customers.",

Enjoyed a cup of the chicken and rice soup before a wonderful plate of the lobster ravioli with shrimp and scallops and baby asparagus. Brunch options were delicious too, others having steak and eggs, and strawberry crepes, crab cakes benedict. Jambalaya had the right spice as well. And portions were just right--not too big. Definitely recommend!",

(Hubby did not want to wait!)  Although the restaurant was crowded, we were seated immediately. The menu is large and varied, therefore a little overwhelming. My husband couldn't find anything that jumped out at him as he then realized pizza was on his brain. But here we are . . .  He chose the Reuben & fries and I got the seafood special - grilled mahi with creole corn-tomato sauce, fried okra, over wild rice risotto (I guess since it was Fat Tuesday they wanted to offer a Cajun dish). His was ok he said, nothing special. Mine was good but after further inspection realized it basically was all frozen or canned. Frozen fried okra (which I still liked!) and canned corn and tomatoes. The risotto was unique and somewhat tasty, but didn't seem to go with the rest of the meal too many flavors competing with each other!  I have no desire to return. It wasn't bad but certainly didn't impress us! I gave them 3 stars although 2.5 might be more accurate.",

First the waitresses who work as a \"team\" were relentless in asking if we were ready to order, finally when we ordered we were first disappointed in the presentation after the food was delivered. There were no herbs to be found and the food looked plain (I had a ribeye and my wife had a filet). The food had no flavor, just plain. The \"team\" then started asking if we were ready for desert when half my steak was still on my plate and I was still eating it. Finally when we finished they brought out a dessert plate it was very unclean and waitress coughed over the cakes. The chocolate cake was the lone highlight of the meal. Will not go back",

Last night I ordered the chopped salad and ribeye filet special smothered in horseradish cheese sauce served with roasted potatoes and creamed corn. Yeah, you can't put that on the Specials menu and expect me not to want it...  The food was very good and the service was even better. Our waitress was so excited to serve us that my date couldn't help but smile and comment on her vivaciousness.   The only thing that I regret was not ordering the chocolate layer cake for dessert. I've had it a couple times before and OMG is it delicious! It's honestly the best chocolate layer cake in Charlotte next to The Palm. It would be hard for me to have to choose between the 2.   All in all, I like Red Rocks and wish there were a location closer to me in Uptown. The menu is vast and reasonable. You can order a burger, sandwich, steak or seafood. The atmosphere is nice but a little casual. I suggest giving RR a go and don't forget to take a peek at their massive dessert tray!",

    "text": "Let's just start by saying - This place ROCKS!  As I have done in the past I use Yelp, and the Open Table Reservations to make the weekends more enjoyable by placing reservations online more than a week in advance.   Our reservations were for 7:15pm and we were promptly seated at 7:15pm.  Our servers name was Ann Marie and she was fantastic.  She provided a few good suggestions for the meals and was very quick to keep our glasses full.  I had the Chicken Marsala w/ wild rice and vegetables (I have added a picture), and my wife had the Petite Filet.  Her meal was fantastic as I was able to swipe a piece or two of her steak.  It was perfectly cooked and was very tender.  Kudos to the chef. Mine was even better than the photo.  The chicken was tender, the marsala sauce was perfect, and had just the right blend of mushrooms to bring out the delightful flavors and it even smelled as wonderful.  This is definitely on the short list as it was very solid in its food,the staff, and the service.  Oh heck, I only gave it four stars, but believe me, it may be worthy of the 5th.  I will be back.......and I am hoping it will be as wonderful.  I would strongly recommend this place. If you have heard of this place and can't find it, it is because it is behind the Fresh Market off of Providence Road and has only one road into its location, it is not like you will just stumble upon it, you must search it out.  Remember to mention Yelp, and you get 10% off your bill.  NCFoodGuy",

You can see the \"ladies who lunch\" crowd here or even the dude in his power suit ready to \"rock\" a deal with a client. Can't say you'll see too much wowing going on from the food perspective.   I came here for lunch with a friend since it was the most convenient location for both of us. Ended up ordering a salad with rare, seared tuna and the light balsamic dressing. I've been on a kick of lighter lunch options lately and Red Rocks' salad options fit the bill rather well.   Our server was....friendly, but seemed a little perturbed when we presented a coupon. Not a huge deal, but just something to keep in mind.   Would I go back? Sure. Am I rushing back to excavate the rest of the menu for something worthwhile? Nope.",
