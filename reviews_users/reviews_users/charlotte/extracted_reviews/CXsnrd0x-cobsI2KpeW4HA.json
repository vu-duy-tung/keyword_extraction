The Spa Cucumber Water and the Sweet Tea sweetened with honey is fab.  Pricing very reasonable.  Sit outside.  Enjoy your lunch or dinner.   So glad you made your way to Blakeney.  Love it!",

They have an assortment of salads to choose from or you can create your own. I had some sort of chicken cobb salad and wifey had a veggie salad with chipotle dressing (hot). They have a drink bar with different kinds of tea and lemonade, all were pretty tasty. They also have a cucumber and lemon water choice, didn't try that. The atmosphere is very casual and clean. Will definitely go back.",

Typically great service and quality but the last 2 visits could have been better- skimping on lettuce to avoid refilling the salad bar- visibly looking for a new container of lettuce and then just moving on when it couldn't be found. Came across as lazy. That being said, still a solid 4 as I love my Palm Beach salad here so much that 2/20 isn't really too bad.",

Seriously, there could not have been 3/4 a cup of soup in the bowl for nearly $7.00! I can only imagine what a cup is served in; a shot glass?   I have never refused to pay for an order of food before, but today I did. That is how ripped off I felt. Corn chowder! There wasn't one expensive ingredient in that tiny bowl for them to justify serving such a ridiculous portion.  The salads, on the other hand, looked more appropriate for the price charged. However, I did not order a salad. This review is based on what I did order.",

I cannot say enough about the great flavors, healthy options, informative nutritional information (calories and labeling for vegan, gluten free, etc.), and the competitive pricing.  I usually create my own and can keep the cost under $10 for an amazing salad.  The staff are friendly, the produce is fresh, and the free flavored water is stupendous!",

But here is the problem and the reason why I gave 3 stars.....I ordered a salad for myself and my son...I stepped over to the chopper and forgot that my son wanted his in a wrap.  I told the chopper and he told me he could only use half the salad for a wrap.  Wait a minute here...you mean to tell me Chopt is charging the same price for a wrap as they charge for a salad bowl yet they only put half the salad in the wrap???   The chopper did offer to put the other half of the salad in a bowl for me.  But I got to thinking all those times I've ordered wraps and have been charged for a full price salad when I only got half a salad?? That seems very wrong to me!!!   So from now on I will order the salad and ask the chopper to put half in a wrap and the other half in a bowl.  I just want what I paid for and the fact that they charge for a full price when you actually get half seems like a rip off to me!",

    "text": "Horrible!!! A few adjectives, Slow, Rude, Out of stock, no manager, all employees with attitudes, poor dining experience. Let me start out by saying, I have eaten here a number of times, I like their salad, BUT tonight when I arrived at 8:45 there were 2 people in line, I waited at least 15 minutes to have the privilege to TRY to order, the place was out of some of their lettuce (imagine a salad place out of some of their lettuce) out of tomatoes, out of heart of palm and from the looks of it out of most toppings. There were 2 employees working the salad line and one guy running around picking up the table in a effort to close and get the heck out of there AND  IT SHOWED!!! There was no manager in sight! They were VERY UNDERSTAFFED and the 2 employees were rude and Slow (if I have not made that clear). We ordered 2 salads, there were very sub par, very small (did not fill up the bowl) and for $23, I would expect quite a bit more. As I stated, I have been there before and will give them another chance, but if this had been my first visit, I would be beyond done with this place. You might want to check back and see if they fire the manager and get some decent staff and food product inventory or just go to one of the other 10-20 places within 5 minutes and get a better dining experience.",

    "text": "It was surprisingly hectic when I walked into Chopt at 2:30 on a Friday, but I was greeted at the door with a menu and ushered into a line.   Basically you either pick a set salad (there are no sandwiches, even the confusingly-named  \"salad sandwiches\" are just salads) or make your own a la carte. It's a big menu, with lots of options and add-on pricing. It seemed like pricing could get steep if you had lots of mix-ins.     It then got a little confusing from there. I picked a set salad and somehow the person working on my salad didn't get it right. She didn't really even make eye contact with me and she walked off (it was hard to keep track of her) She then handed me a slip with an incorrect salad listed, and before I could correct her she said \"go to station 2\" and walked away. There were no signs just lines of people. I looked for station two, and went to the second cash register (that was wrong), so then they pointed me to the right place...I think signs would be helpful for when it's really busy.   I would have just went with the salad they gave me at that point but I couldn't eat a main ingredient in this one so they re-made it for me quickly. After your salad is assembled they take it out and place it on a table where they chop it into tiny bits and add the dressing. The salad came with really good free bread and they had a nice selection of teas and infused water. My salad was under $10, but was huge and contained chicken so I felt like it was fairly reasonable.   I ended up with the Po-Boy Salad Sandwich (salad) Overall the flavor was good, I didn't love the panko-crusted chicken (it wasn't crispy and was cold) so I would choose grilled next time. I would say it was a good salad and a nice option for fast-casual.   Now that I understand what I'm getting myself into, I think the process will be easier next time... I hope!",

So when I came here and had the crispiest lettuce with the freshest toppings... I was in heaven!!!  The salad is huge! I've been twice now and neither time have I been able to finish it!  The layout of the store was a bit overwhelming when you walk in as there was no clear direction as to what we should do or where we should go but we just took it slow and merged in with everyone else. The staff was very friendly even tho it was hard to hear them at times. The process between when you order and when you pay is very quick!  This is definitely a new favorite spot :)",

I must caution anyone planning to eat here after 7:30 pm to lower your expectations. We stopped by tonight, and ordered our salads as normal. When we walked down to add toppings, we were told they were out of Avocado, carrots,  quinoa, cranberries. We ordered 2 chicken Tinga's and 2 kids craft salads. We were understanding of not having some toppings, but after they started chopping and asked what dressing we wanted, there was no California goddess dressing. We opted for caeser instead because that was the only non-spicy dressing that they had. There were maybe 2 very very very short squirts of dressing (#very dry salad). She also loaded my chicken tinga with 3 spoonfuls of chicken (more than likely to compensate for not having quinoa which she didn't tell me until the very end. This was THE chewiest dry dry driest salad I've ever had. The workers seemed to be pretty annoyed with having to explain that they were out of each topping that even the customers behind and in front of us asked for. My husband overheard the girl chopping our salads mentioning that they had carrots and cranberries in the back, but it wasn't \"prepped\". How can you have over an hour and a half til close and not offer your customers something that you simply \"have in the back\" but \"don't feel like prepping\". We spent $40.00 on subpar salads tonight. NEVER AGAIN will we eat there after 730 again.",

The salads are about the same price as Panera, but way better. You get to build your own salad or pick one theirs off a menu. You also get to choose the amount of dressing on your salad which is convenient. If you go around lunch time it'll probably be busy, but the line moves quickly.

At first I was a little intimidated because it is always a long line especially on the weekends and the menu you has a lot of options that made it hard for me to decide what salad to order and then what salad dressing I wanted to add to my salad.   My go to salad is the California Steakhouse. OMG its amazing and I cant seem to order anything else yet. I added fried onions to the salad to give it a little crunch. You really cant beat that huge salad that only has 230 calories!! The ingredients are always fresh and the employees always chop my salad to perfection. I can never finish a whole salad so it might be perfect for people to possibly share.  The teas are really good and so many great flavors. I did not realize there was Agave available to sweeten your tea but my tea was still good unsweetened. There is not soft drinks available here.  I love Chopts unique concept and their amazing menu.",

U can order a menu salad or a mix of what u crave. Agave is used instead of sugar in their dressing which makes for a healthy meal...no crashing after an hour! There's a Chopt app u can download b4 eating here. Don't know the details but I'm sure it must b to the customers' benefit. I'm sure to come here again. Only peeve is that each extra selection is 79 more n I so wanted a sprinkle of corn and a boiled egg but my salad was already $8.97 but so worth the freshness. I usually go to Moe's but this is a step up in freshness. Wish we had a Chopt in Waxhaw!  12/08/16 Spicy Cashew Soba Noodle: was hoping for cashews as the name implies but I guess it's in the sauce. Had to try it n now I recommend if u try it to hv more sauce added than usual because I did n it wasn't enough. I recommend that Chopt top whole or chunks of cashews. Love the edamame but I don't think I'll order this again, rather I'll order it without the soba noodles n add arugula for that nutty taste",

I finally had the opportunity to try them out and ordered some takeout. My salad didn't have avocado (an item valued at $1.99). I called and spoke to a very friendly and understanding employee who offered to remake the salad for me. I explained that traveling back to the store was not conducive to my plans that evening so she took my information and offered me a free salad upon my next visit. That was very kind of her and I was quite impressed with her ability to provide legendary service by exceeding my expectations.   Minutes later, I received a call from the manager. To my surprise she informed me that despite the lack of avocado in my salad she would be doing nothing. I would not be getting the agreed upon free salad. In my opinion, the manager handled the situation very unprofessionally and I have no interest in returning.",

I am not surprised that there is a buzz around this place considering Charlotte doesnt offer a ton of easy, casual, healthy options. When I think of healthy, I am talking about food with integrity. No hormones or antibiotics in the meat, organic when possible, clean ingredients, fresh, etc.   The place was very clean, the menu pretty easy to follow and overall friendly service.  I decided to create my own salad. The salad was huge but I found out after the fact you can do a half order which is a nice option. I chose the mixed greens for my base and they loaded me up with all the other veggies I wanted.  The veggies/toppings are good but they didnt have a few staples like artichokes, almonds, fruit (other than dried cranberries), red onions (only some weird grilled version), red peppers, etc. I went with the grilled chicken and it was gross. Tough. Flavorless. I opted for the white balsamic vinegar and that was pretty tasty. They allowed me to try a few dressings before committing, which I appreciated considering most of them were pretty unique.    Overall, good place. Not my favorite but I would go again when I am craving a huge salad.",

I was eager to try Chopt though as an alternative to days when I am feeling lazy about making a lunch.   When I went the line wasn't too crazy although parking can be a bit interesting. Inside it's very sleek and modern but some signage about where to line up to order and where to stand for the chopping station would help to lessen the cluster. To help, you order all the way to left. If the board menu is too overwhelming, there are card menus nearby on the wall.    I tried the Mavericks grain salad, which has quinoa, scallion, corn, cilantro, and avocado on a bed of kale and cabbage blend. I added grilled chicken for extra protein. I tried the chipotle vinaigrette with a squeeze of lime as my dressing which helped up the flavor profile. The chipotle definitely has some heat to it though. I though the size was underwhelming for the price. It looked like you get maybe more bang for your buck if you create your own.",

Do you know what it feels like to be so sick from throwing up for six hours straight that your body is weak and shaking uncontrollably because it is doing everything it can to force the bad out? After ten hours of being sick with maybe a total of two hours of terrible interrupted sleep, I woke up to a fever of 102 and I am still running to the bathroom all day today because my body is still sick from your dirty contaminated salad. I have never been so sick from food before in my life, but now I can thank CHOPT for showing me the limits of sickness that a body can endure.",

    "text": "Finally decided to give this place a try and I'm a fan!  First time I had the Cobb salad and I was pleased to see that they packed the salad and toppings in and weren't stingy at all.  They ask you what level of chop't you want and they also allow you to let them know how much dressing to put on it.  You can make your version of a salad or you can pick from their signature salads or grain and noodle bowls.  I was certain that after my cobb salad I would be hungry in a couple of hours but I wasn't!  It was quite filling.  We even got a slice of bread to go with the salad.  My daughter got the Kale Caesar and my friend got the cobb for herself and the salmon bowl for her hubby.  Yumminess all around!  We returned today, three days later and got the Kale Caesar again and my other daughter got the Santa Cruz quinoa bowl.  Today the person making it was a bit stingy with the ingredients on the Santa Cruz bowl and they only put a 1/4 piece of avocado in it whereas you get a half avocado in the cobb salad.  They wanted to charged $1.99 for another quarter avocado which I think is just insane but the guy was nice enough to just add a little extra since we didn't know it would be so costly.  That extra piece would put the bowl at over 12 bucks and the bowls are not that big. The Kale Caesar is $6.29 and the Cobb and Santa Cruz bowl are $10.29.  Despite that, the salads are very good and the Santa Cruz bowl, though pricey and a bit lacking on portion size, was delicious! The Kale Salad was delish but it would be great if they added a tad bit more cheese because once you get it all chopped up the small amount of cheese gets lost.  They do have the option of you choosing your greens and up to 4 toppings from a specific category but if you like a lot of stuff in your salad it can get a bit pricey.   I feel like this place is like Chipotle and your experience can hang on whether have you a tight fisted employee or not. You know the ones who act like if they give you even one extra grain its coming out of their paycheck? LOL!!  With the prices, they'd be good to err on the side of generosity in order to make customers want to come back again.  My first visit I definitely felt okay with the price because they were generous and the second visit, not so much and we didn't get any bread. The food was still yummy.  Let's hope the third time is like the first.  I'll let you know.  That is all!",

When we walked to the line, I told the girl I wanted romaine lettuce and to add steak to my salad. She asked me if I didn't want any other toppings to it? So, since I'm new to all this, I thought maybe she wanted my toppings first and then let her know I wanted steak later. It was pretty obvious I was new but she didn't really walk me through with anything. They had a good variety of items. You can pick up to 4 items and anything over that is .79 cents extra. It can definitely get expensive. You get a ton of lettuce but I don't think it was worth it with the little toppings. She walked me over to the gentleman that was gonna chop my salad. He was mixing it and chopping it up and then asked me about my dressing. Wait...what about my steak? He said it wasn't written on there. So you had to go all the way down the line to get my steak. I didn't know the steak was gonna be cold. I thought it would be warm because I've had steak salads before.   I paid over $13 for my salad. Nice and interesting experience but definitely not worth it for me.",

Service is amazing - from asking you if your salad is chopped enough to letting you try any dressing that intrigues you. They have the best crusty bread, and if you need extra it's free! The salads are very filling so I think the prices are fair. Pro tip: get it split in two with dressing on the side and you have two smaller meals. They have a great rewards program if you go a lot you get $10 after every $100, so basically one after every 10 salads. Last but not least, they're environmentally friendly and provide recycling for plastics used and added regular bowls for dining in. Love chopt!",

If you want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a salad that they pulverize with a big knife to make it look worth your money, go for it. The salad was good, but definitely not worthy of the price point. I got the Mexican Goddess bowl. I was really looking looking forward to the street corn on it, which ended up tasting like nothing. There were about three chips on it and the only ingredient that there was an abundance of was the pickled jalapenos which I had to pick out. I like spicy food and it was just too much. I wish I had gotten it to go because the to-go salads look a lot bigger, and the one they gave me in a bowl left me hungry an hour later. The crumb of free bread is laughable. The iced hibiscus was great. I will not be back.",

It initially provided great freshly made salads along with enthusiastic and competent service. The food preppers now consist of lackadaisical teenagers, who really couldn't care less about their customers and who know little about their product.  Our salads had considerable amounts of wilty and/or rotten spinach. The turkey meatballs were cold and tasteless. The young girl who checked us out was aloof, rude and was more interested in the two young men visiting her than us. To add insult to injury, both my wife and I woke up feeling nauseous later that night.  Again this is all too bad. We really liked this place.  Now its completely chopt from our restaurant list altogether. My advice: Go somewhere else, there are simply too many better, cleaner, and better managed options in the area.",

They cut everything up and mix the ingredients together which makes the salad super easy to eat, unlike some places that place large amounts of food in piles on top and expect you to do all the work. This place was refreshing for me. They have a lot of options to choose from and I ended up ordering the Santa Fe Salad. I got the Mexican Goddess dressing with it and it all tasted great! The dressing was a bit spicy so keep that in mind :) all the ingredients tasted very fresh!  I was ordering for multiple people who had very specific requests and I almost expected the workers to get impatient, but they were extremely kind and helpful throughout the whole process!   Prices here are good and the portions are really big! I could've shared it with a second person and both of us would've been full from it :)   In summary, here's why I give Chopt 5 stars: 1. Great customer service  2. Fresh, easy to eat salads  3. Good prices for large portions   Can't wait to come back!",

Today was different, maybe because Zac and I went right after the lunch rush.  I created my own salad with romaine and kale and falafel and cucumbers and tomatoes. I had a low calorie creamy lemon herb dressing. It is amazing how finely they chop everything.  You almost don't know what's in the salad because everything is so chopped up.  They definitely earn their name.  Anyway, my salad went on forever.  I was barely able to finish it, though it was very tasty.  There is definitely a need for restaurants that offer foods that are not fattening.  Too many burger places; not enough good salad places.  This one fits the bill nicely and I hope they continue to do well.",

One of my favorites is the Chicken Tinga.  I have made this selection on my past few visits here.  I love what I like to call their traveling menu.  Every few months they have special selections of pre-designed salads that are based on a specific global location.  It's truly hard to choose, they all sound very tempting.    I do find it a bit pricey for a salad, but the portions are generous and the chopped feature makes a salad into what you really want at home but aren't into all the work.    They do offer bread to accompany your salad but only on request.    Despite my minor concerns, I will always return to Chopt when I'm hankering for a good salad !",

Quinoa is in too many of their salads, and it's pretty nasty, I hate the texture.  Other than nasty quinoa, everything looked fresh, and tasted good.  The Chopt name is because they take all the ingredients, dump it on a plate, and use a two handled knife to chop the salad into tiny bites.  A little gimmick that mixes everything together, but after you chop salad up into tiny pieces, dream on about it not turning into a wilted mess after a couple hours.    The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a trendy salad joint...it's a trendy salad joint stuck in the shell of a mix between Five guys and Chipotle.  To quote the Simpsons \"You don't win friends with salad!\"  It's a good salad, not a bad choice if you are looking for a salad, but they are darn near the price of a firebirds entree salad.  They have tons of people working, so it explains why it was $25 for 2 of us to eat, and I had water.  I just didn't find it was that good of value.",

    "text": "Very different, but good.  You line up after you have read all the menu options posted above the kitchen.  Lots of variety, but you really need know what you want when you hit the cashier.  The salads are very generous.  You get alot.  They put your components together and mix them before loading they in deep plastic containers.  You sit where there is room or take you salads to-go.  Simple operation and they move fast.  Can be expensive if you really lard up on ingredients.  Pay attention.  Their basic salads do not need much more to make them better.  Drinks are at a separate bar/area and you set up what you like.  Good for kids if they are into veggies and salads.  Tell them that it is rabbit food.  Reminds me of places in California:  fresh ingredients, custom blending, many options, fast service and do-it-yourself.  Eat and go or go and eat.  Simple and it works.",

I have long awaited the arrival of this location after discovering the location on Park Rd. After falling in LOVE with Chopt and meeting the mangers at the Park location and discussing expansion over a salad I anxiously awaited the opening of this Blakney location and today was the day that we decided to dine out for dinner and what better FASTFOOD (Anything I don't cook is FASTFOOD) to have than a SALAD.   I had a Chicken Tinga (No Chicken- sub with Tofu), my daughter had a Caesar Salad & my hubby had a create your own salad. The Mexican Goddess Dressing is THE TRUTH & the White Balsamic as well.   Even ran into Brendon Haywood (former NBA player and currently a commentator for sports) on our visit.   This place is awesome I LOVE the lighting as its well lit and has more seating than the other location. I'm super HAPPY with this location :-)",

    "text": ",We enjoy salads for lunch so we decided to try Chopt, a salad restaurant . The restaurant has a myriad of salads : you can create your own you, can order classic salads , grain salads , platter salads and sides of salads. There is a variety of dressings to chose from:: the goddess dressing group the nut and yogurt dressing group , the vinagrette group, Caesar group , creamy classics group and their pantry dressings and condiments such as vinegars  lemon, olive oil etc. Almost every salad ingredient you can imagine such as romaine, kale , arugula , spinach etc . tomatoes and, peppers, cucumbers, different  fresh and dried fruits , different veges ,  peas   beans , chips croutons,  etc plus grains such as quinoa, lentils, millet, falafel and  soba noodles . A variety of proteins  such as chicken , steak, bacon,  shrimp , tofu, nuts and  hard boiled eggs. Different beverages such as natural type of sodas, fruit drinks, are available as well as packaged cookies if somebody wants something sweet . Bread and soup are also available .Prices are moderate, could get expensive with added ingredients ,  portions are not skimpy. The restaurant is clean and bright , friendly, well staffed and busy when we arrived .  You stand at the counter and  pick out your salad selection or ingredient choices. The salad is chopped on a cutting board in front of you behind the counter  ,placed in the bowl, given to you and lastly you pay the cashier.  I ordered the Palm Beach salad with chicken plus a hard boiled egg . My choice was the basil mint dressing which I did not care for  so I requested a different  dressing which they readily  gave me. Initially the salad came with a hot honey vinagrette which I did not want .  I enjoyed my salad very much couldn't finish it ,so it was put in a take out container for me to bring home . I certainly would return again and try a different salad on the menu  Update: returned with my dining mate and enjoyed 2 different  delicious salads. I tried the Classic Cobb with a Green Goddess dressing  on the side and my dining mate the Nashville Hot chicken salad with a buttermilk Caesar dressing. Both large salads priced around $10. Certainly a full meal , with ones Vegetable and protein combos. We also tried the vegetarian vegetable soup, basic in flavor and full of assorted veges. I noticed a menu for kids salads and a  blackboard designating their use of local produce in the area. Definitively a great place to go to if you enjoy delicious salads . The staff are well organized, helpful and friendly.",
