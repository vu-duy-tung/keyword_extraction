My favorites are pad Thai, if I want something sweet and sour and a hint of spicy (you can choose between mild, medium, or Thai hot) and pad see-eu is an all time favorite that I will never get tired of. The place has a Thai feel and the way the servers treat you makes you feel not pressured to choose anything and are open to many amazing dishes. And they serve sushi now! And man it is AMAZING!",

The presentation is always gorgeous. I am a lover of duck, and although it's pricey, I got it once or twice, and yum! I'm also just a lover of meat, and unlike some places that are stingy, Thai 1st is NOT. You order a dish with meat or nuts, and you'll get meat and nuts. Highly recommended, for a friendly outting or a lovely date.",

We were told it had very mildly spicy but once it came, we had one bite and it was way too spicy for our taste. We sent it back and ordered a different dish but when the bill came, our server brought the boxed returned dish and explained that she had only taken 50% off the price of the returned dish and had also added the gratuity. When we expressed our disagreement, she said that was their policy and she couldnt do anything else about it. Eventually we sought out the manager and after speaking with him he refunded the whole amount of the dish and also took away the boxed dish!   In a market with many excellent restaurants, it is unlikely that a restaurant with these policies will stay in business long. As far as I am concerned, I am not going back!",

Crazy,   On the other hand the Nam Sod appetizer ($6.95) is excellent and the Spicy eggplant w/ pork ($14) was very good. Tuesdays and Thursdays they serve serious martinis for half price (4$!!!) other days they have wine specials,  Conclusion: if you order judiciously and you can have a fun Martini-Thai dinner, order indiscriminately and you'll spend too much on too little. If we lived nearer by we'd probably go back often ( I'm a sucker for Martini)",

Coming in I was positively surprised by the decor and atmosphere - not your typical Thai restaurant decor, more contemporary, almost NY like.   Service was good and swift and we ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup, the crispy duck and the cashew chicken.   The soup was just ok... Very watery and i definitely had much better.  My wife thought the cashew chicken was average, not bad but nothing to remember either.  The duck was crispy, the meat tender and the red curry sauce nice and spicy.  So you might ask did i rate this 3 stars?   Well, its because even though the place looks good, has good service and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the food - it was just that: good, average Thai food.   There are definitely better Thai restaurants in Charlotte - but if you're in the neighborhood and crave some Thai curry or the smell of lemongrass you can't go wrong here.",

My friend told me there was a thai restaurant around the area so we both came here for the first time. My friend and I were craving thai food and It didnt seem too busy for lunch hour so we were seated quickly by a very sweet waitress who was also very attentive. My friend and I both ordered the pad thai. Usually when we go to thai restaurants, I can never taste the spiciness so I decided to get the very spicy option where my friend decided to get a medium spicy one.  As my friend and I were conversing, the food came out surprisingly quick. The pad thai was nonetheless VERY SPICY even for my friend who got the medium spicy option.  I've always considered myself to be able to hold down my spice well but after a few bites of my spicy pad thai, my glasses began to fog up. It was delicious! Inside, the restaurant was darkly lit but just enough light came through the windows for a good atmosphere. The decor was not the typical older asian restuarant as it had a modern twist. As the only thai restaurant where I can actually feel the spice I'm my mouth, I will definitely be coming back for more.",

I've worked in a restaurant/waited tables since I was 16 years old. I understand that everyone has bad days, but it took 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge I was there. I then ordered an appetizer and my lunch. It took 20 minutes for my shrimp rolls to come out, and the waitress never even came by to ask me if I enjoyed them (which I didn't). I then got my entree. It was okay. Again, no one checked on me. I went my whole lunch without a drink refill. The lunch was okay, just incredibly salty. I had to ask the hostess for my check because the server was chatting in the back. I asked to speak to a manager and I told him my complaint. He told me that they did team service, and that everyone was my server. Now, I've done team service before at my restaurant and if you team something, you should be giving twice as good of service and you should have multiple people checking on you. The point of working together as a team is to make sure at least one person has a chance to check on a table. Let me also add that this place wasn't very busy. Needless to say, the manager was very unapologetic and it was an awful experience. I will never be returning.",

I was very certain I didn't because I didn't even look at that dish on the menu.

I explained to them this didn't make any sense and they said if I called back when the manager was there, they could refund the money, but that they had no choice but to charge me.

My son prefers Chinese dishes, so when I saw that Blue Thai (now Thai 1st) had fried rice and Pad Thai we had to try it. We were not disappointed. The decor is simple and modern with low light and some asian decor. It is a small restaurant, but we never have trouble getting in and the service is fast. Our servers have always been knowledgable and fast. Now to the food!  The fried spring rolls are great. I prefer the spring rolls to the egg roll wrappers so that was a major plus for me. They are rolled tight and are vegetarian, which is also a plus. The sauce that it comes with is sweet and spicy and really good. The first time we went I got the Chicken Pad Thai and my son got the Beef Fried Rice. You can add heat to either dish so I got mild and he got medium. The mild was almost perfect, but might be a little too hot for those not used to it.  The pad thai had a good amount of meat and vegetables and lots of pad thai flavor. I like mine extra peanut-y so I always get a side of peanut sauce, but it really is good without it. You get a decent portion too, so it could almost be two meals for a light eater.  The beef fried rice was so good I started getting that along with my son on future visits. Lots of beef, fried nicely and seasoned!  We've also had the chicken skewers and Pad Prik - again both great.  Overall a great place and the only down-side is they don't deliver!",

The meat tastes like jerky and hard as a rock. When I complained to the staff, the manager said that this is the way the duck is usually cooked at their restaurant and would not even bother to replace it for me. I had only eaten a bite! Even their staff member did not agree with the managers decision to do nothing. For 23.00 dish it was a waste! Don't bother with this establishment. It does not even deserve a 1 star!",

    "text": "Tried this place for lunch today since it's so close to my work, and I was really pleased throughout the entire experience! I chose to do take-out since I was short on time between meetings, so I called in and Julia answered with the enthusiasm that I wasn't expecting from a hostess. She took my order, gave me advice on what to order since I'd never been before and said my 2 entrees would be ready in 5-10 minutes ~ this was a definite plus since I'm always looking for something quick!  When I arrived, the decor and lighting of this place is really modern with a touch of Thai - since I'm used to Thai House's elaborate wood work, this was a welcome change and somewhere I could see having a dinner date or group there.  Julia was ready with my food, and she was so helpful about what else was in the area since I mentioned I never knew they were there until I saw them in the Entertainment Book! Now on the the food....  Pad thai - I chose spice level medium and it was PERFECT in terms of spiciness. No burning in my mouth, but enough spice to make me grab some water after a few bites and to me that's perfection. The portion was generous, but there was only 1 shrimp in my order and 3 pieces of chicken, amongst a lot of thin noodles.   Pad Karpow - God I hope that's how you spell this dish. Delish! A friend got it with Tofu and spice level medium. Rice on the side, I literally hated myself for not ordering this! A lot of onions, it could have been a bit more varied in the vegetable dept, but other than that this was a 5 star dish.  Overall, a great spot with friendly, quick service. Expect to pay $8.95 for a lunch entree, wait only 5-10 minutes and be sure to accurately ask for your spice level!",

Once we were seated I asked the waitress about their Valentine's Day drink,  \"sweetheart martini\". She said it was \"raspberry flavor\" so I decided to give it a try.  The drink was served with a cherry in it,  I'm allergic to cherries. Unfortunately I had to wait 10 minutes before she came back with napkins or silverware to fish it out.    After taking our order we waited about 20 minutes for the food to arrive.  Ordered the pad thai with no egg (another allergy) and it was just.... ok. The sauce they used didn't taste very good to me.   Our waitress was impossible to find (at this point they were maybe 40% full). The few times she did breeze past the table I'd try to politely get her attention,  only to be ignored.  I finally had to do what I  HATE and wave like a lunatic. Our checks were messed up,  she charged me for 3 drinks,  I only had 2. She didn't charge my friend for her 2 drinks... again,  waitress was no where to be found to correct them.  I finally asked a different waitress if she could help and it was taken care of.   The atmosphere was \"meh\". The food was \"ok\". The signature drink was good,  once I took the cherry out.  Would I go back again?  Sure,  if someone else was paying and I wasn't in any particular hurry. I've had better thai at less expensive places,  I'll probably stick with those restaurants.",

I was skeptical because of the bad reviews, but when my  wife is hungry, decisions need to be made quickly. So we jumped!    The waitress we had was an absolute sweetheart, didn't catch her name, but she was of asian descent. We made her aware of my wife being Celiac and she quickly got us a Gluten free menu. We both order the typical PAD THAI, which we love. The food arrived lightning fast (Thank you GOD), and was very tasty. My wife's PAD THAI included large shrimps, which she said was not fishy at all.     The place had a steady flow of customers with heads down and forks in mouths, so I'm not sure of the bad food reviews. Maybe something else on the menu would change disappointed YELPERS minds.",

Have eaten in many Thai restaurants in the past and Pad Thai is not suppose to taste like this.  The other item that was ordered was the Pad See EU. The flat rice noodles was all curled up at the edges. This definitely not how it is suppose to be cooked. They must have over cooked the noodles. The broccoli was not fresh. Do not know why they made this dish spicy. It did not list this on the menu.  The place was not busy at all. Walked in and hostess was busy on the phone.She stuck her finger out so we waited. Finally, waitress sat us down. They quickly want to take your order, bring your food and check if everything okay. Give you bill and send you on merry way.

But that's when the entertainment began!  Our waitress said she wouldn't charge us for the fly and removed the meal. We assume to replace the meal. She did return, within 2 minutes, with what she said was a child's portion but assured us it was a fresh meal. Funny thing is she never returned to our table.  Another waitress, also part of the comedy team, cleared our table and brought our check, which included both meals. When I mentioned the live fly she responded, \"see even the fly wants to enjoy our food\"!   While the meals cost wasn't significant enough to debate with a skilled comedy team, I was a bit taken by their flippant attitude. So I asked if she really expected me to pay for a meal with a live insect in it.   The comedy routine continued, as she asked, \"was you meal served with the fly or did it enter during the meal?\". I suspect my facial expression reflected my displeasure.   She begrudgingly removed the meal from our check but couldn't resist one final joke, drawing our attention to an open door,  with a chair strategically placed, to assure the staff easy access to the outdoor seating. \"See, that where the fly came from, not the kitchen\"! I couldn't help but wonder if the open door was part of a health code?  Next time your craving Thai food and live comedy, I suggest Thai 1st Bistro! Good humor and free fresh protein!",

    "text": "I spotted Thai First on my way to a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant round the corner and decided to try this place instead. I was really wanting to like this place as I've just moved to the area, Thai food is my favorite cuisine and this place is close to where I live. If I liked it it would be become my regular dining place whenever I was in the mood for Thai.   So I pop in, take a look at the menu, unfortunately they didn't have one of my fav dishes - mango shrimp - but no biggie. I order instead the red curry which shows as $14.95 on the menu. The friendly staff ask if I'd like white or brown rice and I say \"brown rice\". I was taking out as I had somewhere to go. I get the bill and instead it's $16.95! .. I guess because I'm getting shrimp and not chicken or beef? The menu doesn't tell you that shrimp is more or how much more. While I waited I was offered some water .. unfortunately it was tap water that didn't taste like it was filtered. So I get home excited to dig into my nearly $20 takeout meal and what a let down! Not only was the portion size really small, they gave me white rice instead of brown (why ask if you're not going to honor the customer's choice). The red curry sauce was so watery and coagulated - not creamy and smooth as you'd expect. The bamboo shoots were tough and stringy and, on top of all that, they threw in 5 measly shrimp.   Needless to say I won't be patronizing this restaurant again in a hurry.",

    "text": "My wife and I are from the Detroit area and are used to award winning Thai food.  Since moving to Charlotte we had yet to find a good Thai place.  We got some carry out tonight and after paying $35 for 2 small to average size portions I figured/hoped that the food would be worth the price.  I really wanted it to be great.  Not even close....  I ordered one of the signature dishes, Thai Lover, and asked for it to be spiced HOT.  What I got was a bland Masaman sauce with zero heat whatsoever.  The vegetables were soggy and didn't seem fresh.  The chicken and shrimp were underwhelming as well.    My wife got the broccoli w/ tofu. We saute fresh broccoli weekly in our house and know what fresh broccoli is...what she got was small dark little shrubs of broccoli with little to no crunch.  The brown sauce was basically a very salty soy sauce which made every bite a salty letdown.  The tofu was cooked decently but was mushy inside.   I called them back after a few bites just to politely discuss the matter.  I was told by a manager that all produce is selected daily and prepared and all sauces are made \"in house.\"  She hesitantly offered to make us something else but we saw little to no hope that this place can actually produce authentic Thai dishes so we declined.  I stated that we would appreciate a refund and would be happy to return the food.  I was told that she would speak to the owner and call me back after dinner rush.  11PM...no call.  Not surprised.  This food was MAYBE worth $6-$7 per dish...$35!?!  Needless to say, one and done with Thai First Bistro.",

Ordered chicken noodle soup ($9.95) and garlic chicken with white rice ($13.95). Both are in my opinion WAY over priced. Both dishes uses thinly sliced chicken breast which was blanded, the soup had bean sprouts, green onions, and fried garlic pieces. The garlic dish is just stir fry with some garlic soy with cilantro with some sliced lettuce. As you can see in the pics these 2 dishes don't worth the price respectively. I can get bigger portions for less than that at Pei Wei or at Ghengis Grill. So the verdict is that I won't come back ever again.",

    "text": "I meeeeaaaannnn... maaaybeee I need to order something different. It's like when you go to a restaurant and you just pick something off the menu that looks good and by the end of the meal you're practically licking your plate and scooping bits up with your finger cuz it was a dope a** dish. You just know if you go somewhere else for the same dish it won't be the same. Well I've experienced that with some dishes including Green Curry. Now I understand every restaurant is going to be a bit different. And compared to what I've had previously... well that was the case this time.   I LOVE me some green curry. I love the coconut flavor, some cooked but crunchy veggies and shrimp or chicken... whatever I prefer at the time. There's no point in saying where I've had the best curry because it was overseas.   On to this dish. Yeaaa ummm... it was aight. Really just aight... and I say that because of the price compared to the portion size. I paid muthafreakin $17!  Check the pic and you will see how anyone would be a bit befuddled by the fact that they paid so much for such a small dish. That's like barely 2 portions and this was TO GO!  Luckily I wasn't that hungry because I would have torn it up with nothing to show for it the next day.   The flavor was aight. I had to add salt and pepper for mas flavor. It was a light coconut flavor, like they used diet coconut when they mixed the veggies and shrimp or maybe it was water? The veggies were crisp and the shrimp were a nice size. Also, the rice was good, even the next day it held together fine.   The lady who took my order was very accommodating considering I pretty much made up my own dish practically switching out all the veggies for different ones.   Now the lunch price is about $10. I would be willing to pay that price for what I received... sooo... i would be willing to go back and give it another try for lunch obviously hoping I get the same amount and maybe a lil bit more coconut flavor in that bad boy.   So....  Star: Service Star: Accommodations Star (potentially) for portion of food/price of lunch",

    "text": "The food is incredible!!   I've been here numerous times, but with the poor service, I can't see bringing myself to come back.   Our Last Bad Experience...  My friend and I decided to dine outside on the back patio. It was a pleasant day with the sun, but slightly on the chilly side. I asked for the umbrella to be closed. That helped, but it was hard to see my friend and get the sun where the umbrella was shading. We lifted out the umbrella out gently and put it out of the way on a vacant table. There weren't any severs around to ask. Shortly after, a server comes out saying the umbrella must go back in. I ask why and she said her boss is watching everything on cameras all over the establishment. -- can we say creepy --  She also said that her boss told her that in the past he had too many umbrellas that broke, he had to pay for them, so he wanted them to stay in the table.  End result, the umbrella went back up. My order was also specifically placed and they had to re-make it twice due to adding additional unwanted foods that ruined the taste.   This is not the first time I've had bad service so for us, we've decided to rule it out of our regular restaurants. Also, Knowing that I'm being watched is pretty freaky.   Cuisine Ordered in the Past..  SPRING ROLLS Egg roll fillings (no meat) wrapped in egg roll wrapper. Served with sweet and sour sauce.  *These are incredible! Yum. To perfection!  MASAMAN CURRY Potatoes, onions and cashew nuts.  *Omg! Delish. I have cravings for this now. I never used to like curry or anything spicy before coming here. This dish really isn't all that spicy. I order it with only potatoes, pod peas, and broccoli. AMAZING!    I wouldn't recommend the onions in any dish though. Not cooked all the way..crunchy.. and not the sweet vadalia kind.   Spicy Tina & Yellow Fin - #1 plate here for my friend!!! She loved it!!  PANTHER - My friend ordered this, with tuna and fish eggs, she loved it 9.5 out of 10.  SHRIMP FRIED RICE Excellent, once again minus onions + broccoli.   PAD SEE-EU Flat rice noodles stir fried with egg, broccoli, and garlic in a sweet soy sauce.  *Amazing!!!  I ordered it with no meat, and loved it!  CUCUMBER SALAD  *Eeek.. only if you like acidic, vinegar tasting cucumbers with little thin rice noodles on the bottom. It came as a complete surprise. Not a fan!  A tad bit about the Servers..   Jackie, a neat Asian dude that was a great server!  Love his attention to detail.   Bunny, also a very sweet older lady who was very kind and helpful.   Nicki, a new girl. Very sweet and accommodating. A great addition to the team.  Maria, initially a great server and seamed to always have a great experience. She was always extremely helpful in knowing the menu. As a regular, she started to call us, \"my ladies\" (not appreciated) and the service provided went way down.",

When I asked again for the receipt, stressing that if I had been dine-in, they would have given me my receipt, she had to get the manager to show her how. Manager was telling the girl that you always give a receipt (me: duh. Also me: duh) as they were walking up to the register. *I had to ask for soy sauce and she gave me one packet. It's a good thing I had extra in the car. *Whoever tied the bag tied it pretty tight. I really had to dig to untie the knot. *She did give me chopsticks in the bag but no napkins. Again, it's a good thing I have them in my car. *At least the service was fast and there were at least four pieces of shrimp in my order (my standard fav, Pad Thai).  *Not much green onion or chopped peanuts, and they gave me a halfway dried lime slice with a few drops of juice left. Maybe their other dishes are better, though I dare say you shouldn't mess with the national dish of Thailand. *If you're desperately really craving Thai food, these guys will do. I'm from California, where they have loads of different Asian communities with lots of real family restaurants, and I miss real good Pad Thai. *I will continue the search for good Thai food that's not a formal foo-foo restaurant. I'll let y'all know if I ever find one.",

We were also able to give our drink and meal orders pretty quickly. My coworker ordered the Thai Lover. Their Masaman Curry sauce is her favorite. I ordered the Three Flavor Shrimp and an appetizer of the Shrimp Rolls. As I ordered the Three Flavor Shrimp she explained that it would take a bit longer to cook and asked if that was ok. I asked her how long it would take and she then replied \"not long\". Imagine my confusion. But we had time so I ordered it anyway. Plus we had the appetizer while we waited.   The Shrimp Rolls came out fast and looked delicious. I bit into it and it was piping hot. Their serve them with my fave, Thai Chilli Sauce to dip. I must've missed the ground chicken though. Was more like deep fried shrimp, but still good. Though I doubt i'd order it again. Our food came out and it looked amazing. So amazing that I forgot to get my yelp pictures for it lol. I dived right in. They were both served with a side of rice. We shared our meals and they were both absolutely delicious. All of the flavors came through and just danced on my palate. But, were they worth the $20+ prices? Nah. Their prices are a bit steep. I mean I only got like 6 shrimp and a bunch of vegetables. How is that worth $25?  We finished up our food and asked for our checks so we could head out. This was a 30 minute process even when telling her we were rushed to get back to work. We asked for the check, took her 10 minutes to come back with them. When we gave her our cards, took another 10 minutes, then she came back and we asked for boxes, yet another 10 minutes. She also rarely came to our table to check on us while we ate. Was weird as there weren't many people dining. So we finally head out and get halfway through the parking lot and the waitress comes running out saying they charged me for the wrong check. O-M-G!!! Now i'm super mad because i'll be even more late! So I go inside and she shows me the correct price, so I ask them to charge the difference instead of voiding and re-charging. She takes my card, and comes back with a voided check and a new charge. Then I ask for a receipt for the new charge and voided charge, they write \"void\" on the old receipt and give me the receipt of the correct charges that doesn't show my credit card charge. I've never gone through something so ridiculous in my life. And guess what, this took another 20 minutes to do!  While the food is good, I doubt i'd return to Thai First on my own....",

My yellow curry was fine though more potatoes would have been nice.  If it is listed on the menu, having only one small one in the bowl may not be right.  My wife was not happy with her dish which was too salty and barely warm.  We would have thought being some of the first visitors, the food would have been hot.

Pretty good size servings my only issue with this place was I looked at the menu they have on there website to place my pick up order and I guess they have a lunch and dinner menu but only have the lunch prices on the menu online so I was planning on 2 meals being about 23.00 and it was 32.00.  Food was good tho and my husband and j shared some noodles and curry",

She never came back to check on drinks, on our food. Nothing!! No the only thing she did DO is charge us 18% Gratuity for a party of 5!!!  Charged $2.25 for Seltzer Water!  My first visit to Thai First.... kinda left a bad taste in my mouth!  Literally!  So many restaurants to choose from around here... which means why do I need this aggravation, right?  Poor service and the prices on the website is not what they charge at the restaurant!!  :(",

I asked for plastic utensils and a server told the hostess that they do not provide utensils unless requested... umm.. ITS A TO GO ORDER! I didn't fuss about that as the food is relatively decent. Id visit again but only if I have no other options. Id say save your money. Just WAY TOO PRICY for the portion of food.",

I wish I could remember the name of what I had but it was under Rice and Noodles and highly recommended by the waitress who answered all of our questions with a smile.  We didn't try any sushi, but they did have a sushi bar and the atmosphere was great.  We all really enjoyed the night and will def be back soon.  It was very cold inside but once we tasted the food, the chill didn't seem to bother us.  Really glad we found this one!",

It's on the small side which makes it quaint. It was clean and well decorated. We were the only ones there on a Sunday at 3:00 so service was excellent. We both ordered the pad Thai which was priced quite reasonably at $15. We received our food pretty quickly as we were the only ones there. Portion sizes were generous and the food came out piping it. The rice noodles had just the right combination of heat and sweet. I will say the chicken however was a bit overcooked and dry though the shrimp wasn't. In all a good experience, I'd go back if it was convenient.",

The chicken was tender and juicy. The server had asked for our preferred level of spiciness. I asked for mild, and the server smiled and asked if I wanted it on the side instead. I had no idea that was even an option (she was probably laughing on the inside at how pathetic I am with my spicy intolerance). When the server returned, she gave us a red bottle of spicy chili sauce and another bottle of spicy powder. My boyfriend had Pad Thai ($14.95), which includes chicken, shrimp, egg, bean sprouts, scallions, and peanuts. The rice noodles are thinner than what I am familiar with for Pad Thai, but still delicious. I approve of their portion sizes, very filling. However, the prices are too high. Their Basil Rolls ($5.95 for 2 rolls) are also good. They consist of basil, shrimp, rice noodles, lettuce, and bean sprouts, wrapped in rice paper and served with Thai peanut sauce. I do wish that more than 2 rolls were included. Each roll is fully packed with a nice fresh crunch with each bite. FYI, people are reckless and do not know how to drive in this plaza so beware!",

The prices moderate, adequate portion size and plated nicely. Food came out hot and was tasty. We ordered the almost $10.00 chicken coconut soup, enough for 4 servings. It was delicious. The spring roll, crispy and basic. Our chicken satay appetizer was tender with a tasty peanut sauce. We certainly would return to order a dinner entree. See my photos for specific menu choices.

Pad Thai, no egg with shrimp only. When  my plate hit the table, all I could smell was fish sauce. I took a bite, and could hardly swallow it. I informed my server, she argued that the sauce is a shrimp sauce, swearing that there is no fish sauce in the pad thai. She said something to another server and just walked off. She never came back! The second server was sweet. I told her that my meal reeked of fish sauce, and asked if it was indeed in the recipe. She said \"there's fish sauce in there, there always is.\" She went on to explain how the sauce is made in large quantities daily and the recipe is usually the same, but they may have added too much that day. I asked what my options were, she recommended a different noodle dish. Explained that it was \"full of veggies\".  Now, I will say, I should have asked what kind of noodles, but at this point, I'm super hungry. The dish came out, it didn't look appetizing at all. It was full of veggies, but had thin clear noodles in a brown sauce, it was dry. I didn't care for it, at all. I asked if I could pay for my appetizers and drink. She came back and informed me that the Manager would not remove the food from my bill. He said there was nothing wrong with it. I explained that there was DEFINITELY something wrong with the pad thai, and that I didn't know what to expect for the second dish, as it was ordered solely from her recommendation. The manager NEVER came to my table. He wouldn't come and face me. He sent messages back and forth via the server. Who does that?! I was made to pay. A $30 tab for food I didn't eat. I will never patronize this restaurant again, ever.",

Greeted and seated by very friendly waitstaff the booths are comfortable and the atmosphere was inviting.  The menu had a lot of what appeared to Me to be Chinese and sushi options which I wasn't expecting...  but there were Thai items as well so there was that option for some whom may want other options?  I ordered an appetizer- Edamame and the special- Pad Woon Sen with chicken.  My friend ordered the Pad See-Eu with chicken and fresh Basil rolls.   The edamame came out just minutes before the meal so we really ate our way through the appetizer as well as meal at same time.  My food was delicious and I had a shrimp basil roll as well.  It was really good!  There was such a large lunch portion that the \"to go\" box will surely serve me another complete meal!  The food was flavorful and delicious! I would say this will definitely be a book mark on my list of places to eat!",

The inside is quaintly decorated with paper umbrellas and the service staff was very friendly and never rushed you.   I only came for their sushi, but the presentation of everything was like art. The cucumber salad was thinly sliced and delicious, a great light start to a meal that could easily be shared. I also ordered the spicy crab tempura roll, and it was piled high with spicy crab, which had just the right amount of heat. It was light and filling, definitely a perfect dinner for the warmer Charlotte nights. I certainly will be back again to try some of their traditional Thai dishes.",

Although the poke wasn't made with Hawaiian ogo, the bright green seaweed was an okay alternative being that we are in North Carolina after all. The Tom Yum soup had body and it was very tasty but on the sweet side. I'm looking for more of the lemon grass touch. Masaman was home cooking tho it could hv a lil more zing added. The waiter is very sweet and attentive!. Will be back over n over I am certain. This is my go-to place for the home cooking cravings.   07-05-17 Power outage n construction work forced us out tonight.  Closest comfort food was here. Tho, too bad the basil roll sauce was too sweet n the shrimp salad a bit too spicy. Shud've requested less  chili.  Ate it cuz we were hungry. Red Lotus drink n Lychee Martini hit the spot just rt. The Tom Yum soup was tasty enuf to want to bring some home. Just a lil salty, not so bad. Love the Masaman curry with cashews shrimp n chicken. Just that and two bowls of rice can b for two ppl. We also took home an order of Pad Thai but it's best to eat it freshly made. On the sweet side, a bit too sweet for me.",

    "text": "Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm, mmmm, mmm good!  Had lunch here with my hubby and teens to celebrate my birthday and I wasn't really that thrilled about going at first because another place was really my first choice.  We got there about 15 minutes before they closed after lunch so apparently they close at 2:30 and then reopen at 5:00.  They were very kind to us despite our timing and we were only \"rushed\" so that the kitchen staff could be done by 2:30 and leave.  We order three Pad See ew, two with tofu and no eggs, one with beef and for myself I decided to try the Massaman curry which comes with a crispy spring roll. My hubby ordered is tofu pad see ew with a level 4 spice, highest you can get and he enjoyed it but he said he likes the wider noodles that you typically get at other thai restaurants and I must agree with him. His portion size was good as well. My daughter had the same thing with a level 3 spice, wished she'd gotten the 4 but enjoyed it nonetheless.  My other daughter got the one with beef and enjoyed it but she was upset that she didn't really have enough noodles and I must agree.  It was a lot of beef and broccoli but very few noodles, bummer.  Now, on to my massaman curry, level 4.  Amazing!!  At first I looked at the portion size and it seemed really small but it wasn't because I ended up having enough to share with my hubby and daughter.  We did have to order another bowl of rice because most thai restaurants never give you enough rice it seems.  But it was sooooo good!  Great flavor, perfectly seasoned, hot and spicy!  I was pleased as punch with my selection.  The waitress was really nice because she told me that if the kitchen hadn't closed she would have given me a dessert to celebrate but that next time I come in to remind her and she'd take care of me.  The meal with tax and tip cost us about 62 bucks which was a bit steep for a lunch that didn't include any appetizers, drinks or dessert so we may not come back much as a family but I'll certainly be back to get some more of the curry and maybe try a few other options but overall, it's worth a try for sure.  Enjoy!  That is all! (Don't forget to hit the useful, funny or cool button.  Would love the feedback.)",

    "text": "Good food, comfortable, and causal, but they could use a little help with service.  I'm not sure if it was because it was the day after Christmas or if it is usually like this, but there were only two servers for the entire establishment, so there was a little bit of a wait. To their credit, even with the lack of help, our waitress still managed to regularly visit our table.   The food, as good as it was, was a little pricier than what I'm used to for Thai food although it certainly could have just been because of the upscale area that it's in. I ordered the fresh basil rolls ($5.95) appetizer, but was a bit surprised to only receive two small rolls for that price. I ordered the green curry ($14.95) and added the sea food combo (additional $4) which included shrimp, oysters, and what I believe was imitation crab. With the white rice mixed in it was absolutely delicious.   My two dinner mates both ordered the same mild pad thai ($14.95), but when they began eating they realized that there were distinct differences in the level of spiciness. Even the color of the noodles were different, but it wasn't immediately apparent because of the low lighting. I can't attest to their meals myself, but despite the spiciness not being what they ordered they still throughly enjoyed their meals.   If you're looking for decent Thai food this place will hit the spot, but it may be hit or miss on the quality of service you receive and again it's a bit on the pricier side for what it is.",

A friend in the Tyne advised me to this place and said they heard it was pretty decent so I decided to try them for takeout.  Perhaps one day they had decent food, however I will definitely not be headed back.  I ordered the Pad Kee Mao, also known as Drunken Noodles based on its origin.  The noodles were not the correct style of noodles for the meal, let alone quality.  It was as if they had boughten the cheapest noodles they could find at Harris Teeter.  For 15 dollars I thought I would be in for a great meal, but in the end it was just tasteless.  My search for excellent Thai in the Charlotte area continues, but to anyone who is looking for an honest opinion, for both quality and price point, I would avoid grabbing Thai here, as Pad Kee Mao is an extremely common Thai dish, that should give an indication of a majority of the menu.",

    "text": "The name of the place is now Thai 1st. This was the worst experience I've ever had eating out. A friend recommended Thai 1st and raved about it so I went with another friend to check it out. It was terrible. Everything the waiter ordered was disgusting and when the food came, the beef tasted so suspicious in every dish. The waiter asked and then suggested we send it back if it was not to our satisfaction, only to have him charge us for the dish we did not touch and sent back. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I know that when a customer hates something enough to not eat it and sends it back, you don't charge them for it. $74.00 late, we got out of there and will never ever go back. Please do yourself a favor and save your money and time.",
