When I was back in town on business, I definitely added it to my list of places to re-visit and it did not disappoint. I was completely exhausted after a busy day and I hadn't eaten all day either. Thankfully they had drink specials and if I recall correctly my Michelob Ulta was only $2 (maybe $3) and it was served in a chilled beer mug. Perfect! It was just what I needed. My food came out quickly... it was tasty and plentiful. I probably shouldn't have cleared my plate but hey, I did, and I enjoyed it. I even topped it off with another beer. I can't remember how much my bill was but it was inexpensive, which is why I used to love coming to this place so much. Oh and it's never packed. There were only about 4 tables seated while I was there and I remember always being able to be seated immediately and takeout was ready in minutes.",

My job has moved back to uptown and i still don't mind driving 20 minutes one way to eat at this place.  This place is so good, I filled out this information and added their business onto yelp!  The inside is very nice and high end looking for a family run Chinese restaurant. I have no problem bringing a nice dinner date here.  Its also very clean and doesn't have that oily smell many do.  Be sure to check out their Sunday lunch buffet to gorge self for $7 or try their hot pepper chicken, eggplant with chicken(its a special from time to time - its not on the menu but they'll make it for you), or just about anything.  I'm moving to san francisco in a couple months where there are over 750 chinese restaurants according to google and i'm worried I won't find one as good as this place!  Make the trip to north charlotte. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

There were only two or three other groups of people eating at lunch time on a Saturday if that tells you anything. We ordered our food, I got sesame chicken. I could have gotten the same stuff at any food court in any mall. Overall, I was not impressed. I didn't feel like it was anything special.",

It's probably not the best Chinese you'll ever eat, but its high quality and well prepared. The preparation is typically very fast- like under 5 minutes from order to table. The service at lunch is also great- my glass is never less than half full and the servers are friendly.  My favorites here are the Sa-Cha scallops and the Bento boxes. If you order a chicken dish, you can also ask for all white meat for an additional 50 cents. Overall the prices are very reasonable.  And there's usually a lunch special with soup/salad and entree for like $5 or so.  You won't be blown away by this place but you'll have a good meal here.

I ordered Vegetable Lo-mein that $7.95 served in a shallow black plastic dish which I requested no mushrooms but the restaurant felt I didn't want any veggies. So hardly none were added. Had a total of 5 broccoli florets, 4 snow peas and a few stalks of miniature corn. (Over priced $1 to much for what I got). Chicken wings (6) for $4.95. Not the entire wing which includes flats & drums...they were tinniest wingettes that were overly fried. Either make it an entire wing or reduce price. The Crab Rangoon tasted okay. A bit salty as if Cod fish was used. I bet there wasnt any crab meat used. Still tasty w/6 included. But..the vegetable fried rice served in a traditional pint container was decent. For $23...wasn't worth it. Friendly ppl, picked up order (otherwise they charge $3 w/in 3miles to deliver...that's cool. But order must be at least $25..WOW. A bit much for delivery and small quantities of food prepared. 1st time ordering and my last time as well. Out of 5- I'll give them a 1 b/c I ate the food which wasn't that that bad.",

When you sit down you're greeted with a bowl of fried noodles and duck sauce which is very nice to munch on while you wait.  The won ton soup is excellent with fresh made won tons, and an excellent broth. The crab rangoon are fresh prepared as well.  The sushi here is outstanding. We have never gotten a bad piece, and the presentation is suitably authentic and ornate. They will gladly honor special requests. There is a selection of rolls and pieces available for half price on Mondays and Tuesdays.   Service is quick and attentive. The waitstaff is knowledgeable, and makes helpful suggestions. Portions are large.   The spicy dishes are relatively tame, but they will adjust the heat according to your liking.   Overall, and excellent establishment, and very good for a date night movie combo at the nearby Northlake Mall theater.",

They raved about the food so I decided to stop in one day for lunch.  Was quickly seated and received my drink very quickly.  However, as I was waiting on my entree, I noticed movement on the floor.  I quickly realized two roaches were crawling toward me from the kitchen area.  In fact, one was very close to my table.  By the time I got my waiter's attention I had squished one roach to keep it from crawling under my table.  My appetite was gone and I told him I would not be needing my entree and would not be paying for the two sips of tea I had.  He said I would have to speak with the manager before he'd allow me to leave without paying.  I told him he could tell the manager I'd leave quietly or I'd make sure everyone saw the dead roach by my table.  I will NEVER go back and I've told all my co-workers that the place they're ordering from has roaches.  Roaches crawling across a dining room floor are a sign of more roaches in the kitchen.",

The best part is that they have a mini buffet on Sundays from 11 am to I believe 2-3pm. I haven't tried the buffet part just yet, but I'm pretty sure it is good and it's only 8.99 a person.

Much better sushi at the Harris Teeter next door, and I'm not even sure if the chicken in the \"habachi\" was actually chicken.  I've been to half priced sushi on Monday's and Tuesday's that were pretty bad, but I just blamed it on old sushi.  For me to come in on a Saturday lunch and get pale (not torro) looking tuna is just not acceptable.  With the sushi lunch, you get 5 pieces of sushi and tuna rolls.  The tuna in both was barely edible.  3 of the 5 pieces of fish were fishy mackerel or yellowtail.  Just stuff they were trying to get rid of.  The one piece of salmon I got wasn't half bad.  My date ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch.  This wasn't chicken.  It was weird, pale, and kind of gelatinous.  The teriyaki sauce was mostly high fructose corn syrup.  Even my dog looked at me kind of funny when we tried to feed it to her.  Yes, thats where the food went.  Even the little fried pieces of wonton with duck sauce were stale.  These guys need to figure out if they are a Chinese place, a sushi place, or a Japanese place and just do one thing right.  I'm kind of surprised with the rating and that they are even still in business.",

Their lo mein dishes somehow magically double in size when you open the container and their crab rangoon is the best I've had. Other favorites are the hot and sour soup and they have a really great ginger dressing for their salads which is hard to find. The star for me is the sashimi, though. Thick cuts of incredibly fresh fish cut with expertise is reason enough to keep coming back, especially given their lunch specials. The staff is fantastic and always remembers me.

The dining room and bar were totally empty at 3pm on a Saturday aside from a table of high school kids. After my experience, I have no idea why. The food was seriously delicious, the prices were more than fair, and our waitress was great.  Weird note: the decor is neat and what you would expect of an independent chinese restaurant striving for a cool look. But they had a case of cell phone cases for sale behind the register Hahahaha what the heck?",

Their fried Chicken Wings and a side of Fried Rice is a wonderful combination when I'm looking for comfort food. My mom is a huge fan of their Eggplant in Garlic Sauce. It's typically not busy when I dine in, so it's quiet (then again it is 5:30 when I get there). They also offer take out and delivery!",

The presentation was kind of neat in the plate they serve it in.  The only reason the rating is not higher is the service.  It was a bit lagging.  I had to wait a bit to get my order taken - longer than what I consider normal over the lunch hour.

I got a shrimp tempura roll, Alaskan roll, and crab rangoon. The sushi came with wonton soup and wontons. It was a ton of food for less than $14 and I was able to save some for dinner (score!). This place is less than a mile from my office so I'll certainly be back on days when I \"forget\" my lunch. Next time I'll have to sit in and try their buffet.

I paid $7 for the meal and my husband and I shared it so that certainly speaks to the amount of food that came with the meal. The bad news is it was just okay in flavor and execution. There were pieces of shrimp tail in my dish and one shrimp hadn't been deveined. Also, the inside of the egg roll was mushy. I like egg rolls that have texture, crunch and taste fresh. This egg roll tasted similar to the ones you get at the food court.   Overall, I don't think this is a terrible spot but I also don't think it's great.",

Chef Mike was in the house since the food arrived within minutes of it being ordered. The dumplings were tasty and they were accompanied by a sweet, hot sauce. The Hunan beef was also nice and tasty and spicy too.  Was it the best Chinese food I've ever had? No it wasn't but it wasn't anywhere near the worst either. It was hot and tasty and hit the spot on a cold evening. I'll probably go back and see what else I like.",

I used to work near a Chinese restaurant whose fried rice was my very favorite and the frequency of which I would order it proved that very fact. I now have a viable option with Golden Taipei.  It's located in the Davis Lake shopping center that houses the Starbucks and Harris Teeter. It's very small on space and offers a few booths, center table seating, and a couple outdoor tables. They have the typical Chinese restaurant lunch special offerings that come with your choice of egg roll or spring roll and pork fried rice. There's also sushi and hibachi lunch specials, however, I haven't tried those yet.  I can highly recommend the shrimp and broccoli. Unlike other places that rely on bulky pieces of shrimp (to mislead you into thinking you're getting more shrimp), Golden Taipei's take consists of small pieces of shrimp and they are generous!   If pork fried rice is not your thing with the lunch special, they will switch it up based on your preference. Food is ready promptly, so you can either call ahead or dine in during your lunch.",

If you're looking for something with more variety, go to a full sized buffet, but if you're looking for something more discreet, lowkey, reasonably-priced, and also good in taste, this is a great place to go to if you're within the proximity of this location.",

    "text": "Stopped by for lunch. The food as you can see looks like it came from a can and tasted equally bad. No flavor even though I requested spicy. The fried rice was honestly the worst I have ever tasted. The egg roll looked and tasted like it came from a fast food place at a mall. My server had no personality at all. She didn't ask how I liked my food or comment anything when she came to take my plate full of food. I think Tiffany wanted to get back and eat her lunch at the bar. Terrible food and experience. If your on a budget I get it but you get what you pay for.",

They were cleaning up from the Sunday buffet that they offer.  The food was very hot and fresh.  The BEST lo mein I have tasted in awhile ( it actually had veggies in it as well.  Chicken and egg roll fried well. Hard to find a good and reasonable Chinese location for take out in the area. I will return.",

She didn't tell us that somebody would come and help us and we waited 5 minutes for a server and they never came by. Me and my partner decided to leave and find the next Chinese restaurant that was closer to that location. I have never left a restaurant for bad service and I am usually patient even if I don't get the best service. This occasion really surprised me and made me upset because I also saw the same thing happen to a couple that came in right after us. If they don't improve their staff I honestly think that might ruin their business.",
