Good pizza is finally back just wish they were open Sundays. Need some za for watching football.",

I have to say tag lines of \"Real Italian Food\" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately, I was let down. There is nothing authentically Italian about this eatery. Staff was upbeat and nice , pizza buffet was sparse and pizza looked old. It was right around dinner time , so if anything, that's when the buffet should  be stocked with choices.  We ordered a pizza with meatball and pepperoni, and a side of mozzarella sticks. Sauce was decent and sticks were good, toppings were fresh. It's convenient, if you live in the area, but I don't understand all the hype.",

It is bar none, the best pizza in the Tega Cay/Fort Mill area.  This includes the way overpriced Carmellas over near Carowinds.  Better yet, they send out coupons monthly in the mail that can be redeemed for $ off your order.  Unfortunately, Village Pizza closed it's doors thus I have dropped the rating to 1 star to reflect this.  Another pizza restaurant has opened up in it's place but I have not yet had their food.",

I LOVE their pizza- the Red Veggie is my favorite. They definitely have the best sauce in the Fort Mill/Steele Creek area. I have tried almost everything on their menu and it is ALL delicious!  My favorite dishes are: the Stromboli, the Chicken Parm, and the Hot Roast Beef sandwich with Au Jus- yum!  My husband's favorite is their homemade lasagna, which he says is better than his Nonna's. The owner Ginny is so sweet and always remembers me and asks about my family. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "I went to the lunch buffet. Never seen a team work harder in a restaurant. So... I'm honestly not sure how to rate them. It's either a 5 or a 3. I'm going with the 5 but let me explain why I would consider knocking 2 points off:  Pros: - Never seen the staff in a restaurant, let alone a buffet, busting their butts like the gals here. Everyone was attentive. - The place was basically spotless. - Was busy but not overcrowded. - Located in a spot that reasonably easy to get in and out of. - Locally owned, not a chain. - They use good cheese. Important on a pizza. - Slices are a nice size.  Cons: - Selection. While we were there, they usually had 3 pizzas out at a time. Most of them are split - i.e. half pepperoni, half cheese only; or half supreme, half hawaiian. - I would have liked to see them offering to customize a slice or two to order. - Toppings were a bit sparse on most of the pizzas I saw on the buffet. - Pasta station is clearly an afterthought and doesn't get much love. - Crust was bland to me. No yeasty flavor or other characteristics.  If you want a simple pizza - i.e. cheese or pepperoni - and a salad, you can't go wrong here. If your pizza preferences don't fall into the standard pre-made pizza categories, you're kind of out of luck.  Suggestions for improvement: - Rethink the pasta station. There's got to be a better way to hold pasta and sauce. And why hide the breadsticks there? - Offer to customize 2 slices to a customer's preference. - Put a stack of plates to the right of the salad bar to improve flow.  So I'm going with a 5 for this review because if I was a mom with teen boys who wanted pizza for lunch, this would have been a homerun. And for a quick stop on your lunch break, it checks all the right boxes.",

The quality of the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. Salad didn't look so fresh, didn't touch that. The seats & tables are quite small and the restaurant itself didn't seem so clean.   The manager came by around once and asked if everything was okay, so that was nice.

    "text": "Village Pizza receives a one star rating from me based on taste, food appearance, food temperature, and inaccuracy  Order  I placed an online order on September, 4, 2019. I ordered lasagna, chicken tenders, fries, grilled chicken salad.   Packaging  The lasagna came in a plastic container--the bowl was black, the top was clear. This was in a plain brown paper bag with the receipt stapled to the bag.  The chicken tenders came in white styrofoam container. The salad was in a clear container with a \"9/4\" date scribbled on a piece of masking tape. These items were in a white plastic bag.  Food Appearance  The lasagna looked weird. The sauce was super dark. The noodles were black. The lasagna was more sauce than anything. The cheese on top looked fresh. It looked like the lasagna was made awhile ago.  The chicken tenders were square and flat. They looked like the a low end brand from the grocery store. They looked cold. The salad didn't look fresh nor appetizing. The grilled chicken on the salad looked old and dry.  Taste The lasagna tasted weird. It wasn't the best nor the worst. I've had better and can cook lasagna much better. The sauce wasn't good. The chicken tenders tasted freezer burn. They tasted like they had already been made. They didn't have much flavor.   The salad was ok--I ate the iceberg lettuce and few pieces of chicken and picked over most of it because the tomatoes and bell pepper didn't look good. The tomatoes were not bright and fresh.   Temperature  The chicken tenders and the lasagna was cold. The lasagna was also cold.  Accuracy  My order was not accurate. I did not receive the fries.  Customer Service There is no email address on Village Pizza Website. So I could not send an email about the missing fries. I called, but no one answered the phone.i",

This place used to be great and our regular Friday night spot to order from but after our delivery orders were consistently wrong we stopped. Well, we foolishly gave them another chance and low and behold the order showed up wrong. When we called to let them know we were told we ordered wrong (didn't know there was a right & wrong way to order a sandwich) and they did offer to give us a free sub the next time we order, however, these were our dinner plans and the kids were hangry NOW, not next time. So after being scolded for our \"incorrect ordering\", being told it would take a long time for another one and then reading the menu to them so it would be made correctly the second time around, we sit here and wait for dinner. NEVER. ORDERING. FROM. YOU. AGAIN.  UPDATE: We ended up having to cancel our order because the kids bedtime came before their dinner did, so thanks for that Village Pizza.",

Well we ordered a supreme pizza tonight, it look like they already had pepperoni pizza made up & they just added toppings on top & heated it up. The bell peppers were not cooked. They were hard & crunchy like raw bell peppers. Called Village Pizza & explained to them how the pizza looked. They gave a lame story/explanation of why it was like that. They had no compassion really for what I was saying or how disappointed I felt about this pizza. They never once offered a manager! Well for $40 worth of pizza that I was disappointed in, we could have just ordered regular Pizza Hut or Domino's Pizza. We will not be returning here to eat pizza. Maybe & hopefully they will pay attention to their reviews on fb, Google, Yelp, etc since there is no concern or compassion when you call them.",

But when I came in the door they had bright vibrant colors and the table cloths had glass covers. It's all counter service but they do everything very well. The pizza was hot fresh and hand tossed. The salad bar was well stocked and it even had chocolate pudding. I had read several negative reviews about this place but I think those helpers are either snobs or were having a bad day. Not every place is serving gourmet custom flash fired pizza. This is a great place with a nice setup, hot fresh food at a reasonable price and friendly staff.",

I did ask for vegetarian options but everything they continued to put out had pepperoni on it. I was taking my 14 year old out to eat as a reward, so this was very disappointing. He only got 3 slices of pizza and was prepared to pig out. We came for pizza and got six slices (total) for $15.80...would have been better off just getting a box of something. We left highly disappointed. We did try the breadsticks which were bland and no marinara to dress it up. They also tasted old, as did the cinnamon sticks.
