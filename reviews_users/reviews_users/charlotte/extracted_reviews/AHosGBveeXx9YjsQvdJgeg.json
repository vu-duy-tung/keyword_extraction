If you go to this restaurant and don't look like a rich person they will treat you like a second rate customer. Went for birthday celebration and was very let down. NOT worth it! This restaurant wants to cater to the upscale but leaves very much to be desired. When I relayed my dissatisfaction to the owner he offered to buy me a chocolate martini- sorry that won't cut it, I will never go back and I will make sure to tell all my friends and clients how bad it was!",

Our candle lit booth with a very high back was seated right in front of the windows overlooking the city.  The waiter was very helpful recommending several wine selections that were reasonably priced.  As we had our first glass of wine we watched the sunset.  Warm fresh baked bread was served.  Ordered the  Oysters Bentley to start, amazing and fresh!!!  Next, Cesar Salads, very good.  My date ordered a platter of bison, filet and lamb.  Each bite was perfection. I ordered the special which was a mouth watering sea bass.  The wait staff was very attentive but also didn't bother us too much which I liked.  Lastly came complimentary candle lit Creme Brule that was very tasty.  A great way to end a romantic birthday dinner, leaving us both very happy and satisfied!!!  It is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants in Charlotte but definitely worth the money!  We will be going back for my 30th very soon!",

    "text": "I took my wife here as a surprise for her birthday and we came away a little disenchanted.  It began with a Reservation that was made online a little over a week before our dinner. After reading all of the reviews about the view, I requested a table by the window and that a bottle of her favorite wine be table side when we arrived. I received a confirmation in less than 5 mins.  When we arrived, the hostess escorted us to our table. This would be my first disappointment of the evening. She put us in a table as far away from the windows as possible. I noticed this was the only empty table and to top it off the blinds were down ( they did open them as the sun began to set but we had to get up and walk over to the window to enjoy any part of the view) so I tried to hide my dissatisfaction and move on. There was also no bottle of wine waiting for us either, but they did bring it right after our waters were poured.  We both ordered our meals and 2 of the window tables opened up. I walked up to the hostess and told her that we would like to move to one of the tables by the window that just opened up. She told me that she could not re-seat us as it was not fair to the other guests??? I told her that my reservation clearly asked to be seated there and she told me that there was no guarantee on where you would be seated. So, why wasn't this stated anywhere in the website or even mentioned in the confirmation? Why couldn't the hostess have told us when we arrived that the table I requested wasn't available and given us the option to wait or take what they had? I went back to my table and explained to my wife what was going on. She said that what appeared to be the Manager was making his rounds through the other tables and that I should talk to him. So I decided to wait until he got to us. In the meantime, now there were 4 tables unused by the window and it was quite obvious that they had no further reservations for the evening.  As we waited for our food, we finished our glasses of wine, water and the piece of bread that was brought. Now, when you are paying $50 for a $9.99 bottle of wine, and over $50 per plate, I would expect to NEVER have to ask for more wine, water or bread, yet, that is exactly what I had to do. The wait staff was very attentive once we engaged them, but really? Why do we have to point out these things? This place prices itself to the extreme high on the fine dining map yet can't get the little things right.  When the food arrived it actually looked good and was prepared perfectly. I had the Bentley Ribeye and my wife had the Mixed Grill. The food was quite enjoyable. For Dessert we ordered the Bananas Foster. This was prepared table side and it was delicious.  We never saw the Manager (my guess is the Private Party they were attend to in the other room had his attention) so I could not voice my dissatisfaction with their seating policy and as we got up to leave and there was STILL 4 empty tables at the windows that no one was ever seated in, I became more angry then I was when we arrived. The view and the seating were the main reason that I chose this particular restaurant as well as giving my wife a great dining experience. The food was good but it didn't make up for the other things that this place lacked and the total disregard they had for regular people that come there to drop well over $200 on a meal AND an experience.   Save your money - you get treated better, and spend less money at the Melting Pot, The Capital Grille, Ruth's Chris or probably any other place in the City. This is one place that we won't ever patronize again.",

They certainly went all out. Service was detailed oriented almost to the point of forcing more drinks and food upon us. My wineglass was never empty and countless options were presented. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The view is incredible with floor to ceiling windows - all that wine made the experience go to my head a little. Special occasions belong at Bentley's. We missed the parking deck on the first so keep your eyes peeled.",

    "text": "Great view. (insert sounds of crickets chirping here)   But that's about it. Bentley's really didn't impress me the other night.   When we got there- the hostess asked us to take a seat in the bar as our table wasn't ready. Okay. So we sit in the stylish bar in front of the fireplace and a woman comes over to take our drink order. At that point the hostess came and got us for the table and the server basically never got us our drinks. In most fine dining restaurants- once the drink order is taken, it doesn't matter if you drink them in the bar or the restaurant; they take them to where you are. But not the case here. So we never got that first drink.   That was the first service mis step of the night. The rest of the service errors were due to the server who we had (or didn't have, as the case may be, as this guy was missing in action for most of our VERY long dinner).   We were celebrating a birthday and had asked for a window table for this occasion. We were seated in the perfect table- right on the edge of the window looking out over downtown Charlotte. This was off to be a great night. Or so I thought.   Our server came over with a couple of bottles of champagne to tempt us but we were in the wine and cocktail mood so we passed on the champagne. Maybe that was our mistake as this guy didn't come back to our table to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes.   No drinks. No bread refresh. No fresh ground pepper (other tables had it) No service. Where is all this \"southern hospitality\" that my friends down here talk to me about? Not at Bentley's on this Thursday night, that's for sure.   We placed our order. Too bad for me that they didn't have Grouper on this night although it was printed on the menu (my fav) but had instead substituted Mahi Mahi in for it. No thanks. I went with surf and turf with a filet and crab along with a salad to start.   My friend ordered escargot to start and this same server tried to talk him out of it saying it would take 20 minutes to prepare. \" Hey!\", thought I. \"The man wants snails . . .give him snails!\" Don't try to talk him out of it. So the rest of our appetizers came up with the snails and were quite good.   There might have been a pacing problem in the kitchen as our entrees then took forever to come out. And when they did, other than the sides coming out piece meal, the food was pretty good- although there was gravy over my filet when I had ordered it with Bearnaise sauce. Also-there were only 2 melted butters brought out to the table- when clearly 3 of us were having lobster or crab.   At this point- our dinner was going on the 2.5 hour point and we were meeting others and had to go. However- we knew there was a special birthday dessert coming out but again . . .it was taking forever. When it finally came out, we had a forkful and then practically ran out of the door.   Dinner for 4 ran about $400 which would have been reasonable for a fine dining restaurant, had we gotten a fine dining experience.   An off night? I don't know. This server really blew it. And at that price? I am sure there are better choices in Charlotte.",

The second server over did filling up my water glass, constantly. Later the first server said he forgot to tell us the name of the second server. I left a 23% cash tip. When we left the first server passed by and did not even acknowledge us or say anything. I felt that we were treated differently because we were two women and did not order  drinks. I will only go back for the view and dessert. I live uptown and this was my my worst upscale restaurant experience. Back to the Capitol Grill where the staff treats you with dignity and respect.",

Starters were superb (blackened tiger prawns and luxury mac 'n cheese). Main course was good (dover soul and the seafood speciality). Although the latter was overly rich and could have been a little more balanced.   The cheesecake dessert was however a letdown and it took forever to make its way to our table. Suffice to say that the best thing on the plate was the fresh fruit. Bentley's on 27 is knocking on the door of 4-stars but just missed the mark.",

A reservation is an absolute must and be sure to request a table near a window for really spectacular dining views.  I've been for dinner, drinks, and lunch. Getting drinks at the bar is the one thing I wouldn't  recommend, unless you're just waiting on a table. The bar area is generally devoid of people, has a strange assortment of furniture, and the bartender isn't exactly attentive.  The food: the plaza salmon, filet, salads, and soups are all delish. The grown up mac and cheese is good, but over-hyped and far too rich.",

The wait staff is very attentive & welcoming.  We ordered drinks that were perfectly balanced and the kick came a little later. I had the Bently Martini (2) & my husband had a Pink Lemonade cocktail but I don't remember the name. Both delish!  For an appetizer we started off with the crab cake. While small...it was mouth watering. I actually closed my eyes to savor the moment, ha! Definitely more crab than cake, seasoned & cooked to perfection.   We both ordered the Filet Oscar served with whipped potatoes and asparagus. Beautiful presentation and so filling! We both were unable to finish oir entrees & I didn't have to eat a single thing else for the rest of the evening.   After finishing up with our entrees then came the surprise surprise! For my birthday they brought out the most delicious Creme Brulee. I don't even like custards and puddings but THIS...wow! As stuffed as I was...I couldn't resist.  Bentley's gave us a great 1st time experience with amazing views of Charlotte! Service was prompt, food was delicious & the setting was perfect! Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "It helps when your restaurant is located on the 27th floor of a skyskraper and overlooks an entire city...  ...the view from above is amazing and makes your overall dining experience that much better. Bentley's has a clean atmosphere, simple decoration and tons of light coming in through the wall-sized windows surrounding the entire dining area.  I've had the unique pleasure of eating here on numerous occasions and while it would seem that a place so upscale and sophisticated would cost you a week of lunch money, a quick look at the menu keeps your feet on the ground.   Every dish on this menu is delicious and there's really nothing you can hold against the food here - especially not the prices. A new york strip over roasted potatoes and green beans with a pepper sauce goes for $18 at lunch.... that's probably the most ridiculous thing I've heard in culinary pricing. The almond crusted trout is sublime - crispy, savory and colorful. Bentley's presentation though is what really makes the food stand out (see photos). You can tell they have perfectionists in the kitchen because each dish comes out like a piece of artwork and the portion size is generous - even by American standards.  If you have an hour for lunch this is the place to go. It's never too busy at lunch time... because most people don't have time to fine dine in the middle of the day, but my experience each time has been consistently good. Frankly, I can't think of any other restaurant in uptown that stands up to this one at lunch. Not even Ruth's or McCormicks. If you're looking to just snack, they even have light appetizers like French onion soup and a variety of gourmet salads.  Definitely worth the ride up the elevator!  5/5",

    "text": "3.5 stars. Caveat can be found in the food section below.  I was here for a company group dinner last night and would have to say that I was a nice experience.  Ambiance: being on the penthouse level of downtown Charlotte, this restaurant has (I think) a 360 degrees view of the city. Just magnificent and romantic.  Service: along with the top prices you pay here, the services is TOP NOTCH, which I would say that I'm quite impressed with the wait staff. Just very professional and very polite which positively contributed to my overall experience.  Food:  I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if I my meat would have been done right. Let's break it down:  Apps:  shrimp cocktail was fantastic. The shrimps were humongous and my colleague really liked them. I did not try them myself.  Tuna carpaccio: I thought this was pretty good.  Escargot: omg so delicious on the tiny toast!  Very nicely seasoned with garlic and herbs. I really have enjoyed this dish.  Fried calamari: OOOMMMGGG! Best fried calamari EVER! You have not lived until you've tried this calamari! Well if you're a calamari person. I called this fried calamari steaks! Lol. Cut into thick slices and delicately breaded and seasoned, they were fried to a perfect consistency. The slices of sliced calamari were perfectly cooked, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Just absolutely amazing! the aioli was just phenomenal!  Side salad: standard salad but the balsamic dressing was way to acidic for my taste.  Entree:  Bourbon filet mignon: I didn't eat this but my colleague told me that this was very good.   Mixed grille: I was a little disappointed with this dish... The mixed grill included 3 different meats: lamb, bison, and filet. The lamb was fantastic! The filet was a little too salty and over cooked (medium instead of medium rare) and the bison hanger steak was cooked correctly but lacked flavor. I was surprised how lean the bison hanger steak was, and I thought it lacked flavor. The red wine reduction was too salty.  The bamboo rice was very good.  Bananas fosters saves the day! For dessert, I shared a bananas foster with my colleague and we were all pining for more!!! It was a show and a desert because they prepared it table side and we can smell the caramelizing sugar while the waiter prepared it. I would have licked the bowl if I was alone! Lol  Overall, very good restaurant and had the prices to match it. However next time I will  order fish instead of the steaks.",

The menu was a prix fixe, so options were a bit limited.  We started with the Queen Charlotte salad. The sweet/savory combination of this salad really worked well for me. The entree I chose was the filet mignon. This was prepared perfectly. Medium rare and tender as any steak I've ever had. The red wine reduction was quite well made as well.  The restaurant did not go short on the wait staff either. The food came out fresh, hot and together (for 50+ people, no mean feat) and nary had a wine glass remained empty for long. Creme Brule finished the meal and a slow stroll back to the hotel.",

The food is absolutely killer and I don't even know who the chef is. I'm a first-timer. The best sea bass I've ever had, garnished with marinated Brussels sprouts. My server (a word I hate, remind me what's wrong with waiter?) was a 10. Truly. Jason knew not only the food inside and out,but the entire wine list, which is very thoughtfully put together. Someone seriously knows their wine. Susan, the other server, has an attention to detail one only finds at places like Boulud. The bartender, Susan, made me a perfect Martini. I mean perfect. She could be chief bartender at Kings (St Regis). Anyone who knows bartending knows it all begins, and ends, with the ability to master the martini.  Hang on...Grace, the hostess?  She's just that...grace personified.  You simply won't find types like her up north. This place is on floor 27, with astounding views of Charlotte. I watched the sun set as I sipped my super cold martini and nibbled on freshly warmed focaccia. I'm bringing my wife here. Candles, intimate booths.....This place is exceptional.  Stay at the Hilton, right next door.",

First I'll start with the good: - Amazing atmosphere and view - Exceptional Service - Calamari  & Stuffed shrimp were both very good. - Temperature of the steak was on point - The waiter was kind enough to bring out a free dessert for my birthday  Cons: - items were $4 - $12 more than the prices listed on the menu on their website.   - Quality of the steaks: My boyfriend ordered the Strip steak and I ate almost a third of it because he filled up eating the app and half my meal because the steak just wasn't great. The sauce was very good but the steak itself was chewy. I have had a lot better steaks places that were significantly lower in price. I would expect a diner to cover a low quality steak with a great sauce hoping someone wouldn't notice NOT when you are paying $38 for the dish.   - Sides weren't that great: It was like they put all the thought into the sauces but just didn't care about the sides. One dish came with small potatoes that had absolutely no flavor. The mashed potatoes and green beans were the same way.",

We always make reservations and arrive early (even though there are plenty of tables available at lunchtime) because we want to get the table with the best view of the city. On our last visit, I ordered the Chef's special which was a lovely salmon, with grilled asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a delicious mushroom-bourbon gravy. I have never had salmon cooked any better, to the exact temperature that I'd ordered it.  And although I don't love asparagus, theirs had that freshness, but was still tender, with the hint of a char. Yum! I would eat that asparagus every day.  I attended lunch with two co-workers who were dining at Bentley's for the first time. Both loved their meals and the entire experience.  Service was on-point, the atmosphere was great, the food was delicious.  Ahhh!  I couldn't ask for more.",

We got a roll before everything and it was good but I LOVE bread and was looking forward to eating more than just one roll, but that's okay.  We got to each pick an appetizer, I got the filet wrapped bacon and he got the lobster cakes mine was good, I tried his (even though I don't like lobster) and I thought it was over-flavored with lemon. For our main course we both got the filets that came with artichoke and potato.  My filet was overdone with no pink and kind of burnt even, when I asked for medium-well which means some pink.  (Don't judge me on my filet preferences lol). I also was expecting the filet to be flaming as I saw in the pictures, but I guess that's because it was a set dinner.  The artichokes had too much flavor for me to eat them, the potatoes were okay but not amazing.  Moving on to the dessert, I got the strawberry shortcake cheesecake, and it was fantastic, probably the best dessert I have ever had, he got the chocolate truffle mousse  and really liked that too.  I probably would come back here (not on a fixed menu night though) just because of all the really good reviews on here, it may have been just an off night.",

It wasn't as crowded as we expected it to be on a Saturday night.  The waiters were just okay. I found that one spoke too loud for the environment and interrupted conversation. The other continually put food and drinks down in front of the wrong people. The only plus was that the water glasses was always full.  The drinks from the bar seemed fine. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food. My entire order was a strike out. Malbec by the glass was awful. French Onion soup was just okay. Nothing special. I then had the peppered steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was bland and fatty. The potatoes were bland and less than creamy. The green beans were well seasoned or marinated.  My dad ordered the calamari for an appetizer. Warning: It can feed three to four people, which they fail to state on the menu or out loud when its ordered. The only redeeming quality to the calamari is that the pieces are huge and fresh. The restaurant was also out of tuna tartar. A crab cake was ordered, as well as the adult mac and cheese. The adult mac and cheese has truffle and lobster in it, but is way too rich for one person to finish by themselves. The crab cake comes over couscous in some sort of creamy pesto sauce which was okay, according to those who had it.  The lamb chop is delicious, as is the bison steak. The bourbon filet is just okay, but if you're into bourbon then it may be right up your alley.  I certainly will not be back based on my personal experience.",

He is a regular for lunch here, was expecting the dinner prices a bit higher than lunch prices but it was not the case. Entree prices for dinner were more expensive than we expected.    We ordered the following items Appetizers; Bacon wrapped jumbo prawns - one of the best shrimp I had. Crab cake - I have eaten better at other places.  Entrees: Mixed grille (Filet mignon, lamb chops, bison piecea on a bed of rice cracker and vegetables) - ordered it as per our waiter suggestion and glad we did. Filet mignon was juicy and slipped into the mouth like butter. Bison was ok. Lamb chops were tasty.  20z Ribeye -  It was really big and one need an empty stomach to finish it. Size worth the price but as per the taste, I had eaten better tasting ribeye for cheaper price elsewhere.  Dessert: Creme brulee -  I love this dessert and it always finds a place in my order. Simply I liked it here as well.  Service: Our waiter, an elderly person has good knowledge of what goes in each of the food item, how they are cooked/tasted, suggested some wine pairings and his explanation tempted us to order all the entrees. In a nutshell I loved the service.  Decor: This place is known for the view of downtown. We pretty much concentrated on the view outside. Interior was ok for me.  Total bill: $152  Bottom line: One time experience for dinner. Always stick to lunches here.",

I lunched here recently for business with my recruiter and had a marvelous dining experience! He and I shared our love for oysters over the Rockefeller. So delish were they that we were falling all over ourselves to offer the other the last one. I insisted he have it out of sheer politeness, and the fact that he was picking up the tab. Likewise, I endeavor to stay in his good graces... he is after all keeping my resume in the forefront of his mind for gainful, high-paying employment to keep me eating and Yelp-ing!   With oysters devoured, and without further niceties, we both ordered the salmon Oscar, which was the day's lunch special. When it arrived looking all scrumptious and stuff... OMG, I could hardly contain myself. It's presentation was a feast for the eyes, and the type of entree you knew was going to bring about a feeding frenzy for the palate, just from the mere sight of it. And, indeed, it did not disappoint! The salmon was moist with the perfect doneness, not overcooked or dry. It was topped with a generous amount grilled asparagus spears, crab cake (yes, crab cake, not lump crab meat) and buerre blanc sauce. Of course, I ordered extra buerre blanc on the side, just 'cause I'm saucy like that! LOL! It was accompanied by a well prepared vegetable risotto, laced with cheesy creaminess, roasted zucchini, yellow squash, and red pepper... somebody pass the tip jar for that risotto alone!   The wait staff service (there were a few) was very attentive and accommodating, although the female taking our order did not have the greatest personality. Nevertheless, napkins were folded, crumbs were whisked from the tablecloth, and beverage glasses were kept full at all times.   No dessert pairings this time around, as the remaining time was spent talking business. If our meal was an indicator, then we are off to a good start to add Bentley's to the list of upscale restaurants to which I have grown accustomed!  Loves it!",

The minute you walk into this place you can see that not a lot of thought went into transforming the space from offices to a restaurant - it feels like you are having dinner in a conference room.  The same lack of attention is found in the kitchen - nobody is trying here because they don't have to.  The nice waiter \"George\" has been there forever I am told and he was far and away the best thing about the place.  Another $500.00 wasted that had us looking for a burger on the way home...sad!",

    "text": "So Bentley's does hold a special place in my heart, but nevertheless the food and staff are amazing!  My husband and I had our wedding reception there in September, and our guests are STILL raving about how amazing the service and food were.  We had a seated dinner with a choice of filet, chicken, or halibut--all of which were rated \"SO GOOD!\" by our guests.  The staff was so attentive that wine glasses were never empty.  The only complaint I heard was that the Bentley's martini ran out shortly into cocktail hour.  We should have ordered a larger batch!  You don't need to go to a wedding at Bentley's to enjoy it though.  I've been there several times, and the food and service have always been amazing!  The Bentley's ribeye is very yummy--especially with the jumbo asparagus and bacon cheddar mashed potatoes on the side!  The Chateaubriand, filet, king crab legs...all to die for!    This is definitely not an every day type of place because of the price (not unreasonable for the quality), but it's a wonderful location for a special date night or nice dinner.  Or if you're considering having a party or wedding reception there, I'd definitely recommend it!",

My first choice was BLT and when I tried to reserve there they right away informed me they had a private event and cannot guarantee us seats Bentlye's said nothing when I reserved. I show up for dinner and i see that they have a private event...they take us to sit in a stodgy room on the right of the reception . They were asking us to sit by the wall in a booth instead if by the windows. I said i would wait for a window seat and was told there was no chance of that due to the private party which had taken over their main dining area. This was very upsetting....considering the reservtions were made weeks in advance with a cell phone number on file and for a birthday...but we were never informed about a private event...needless to say we left and went to Aria for an amazing evening...ver very disspaointed with Bentley's",

To begin with the restaurant is beautiful with a great view.  We sat by the top to bottom window overlooking uptown. The food was superb.  We had an appetizer which included bacon wrapped filets, perfectly seasoned and cooked calamari and lobster cakes.  All of which were great.  My husband had the ribeye and i had a perfectly cooked shrimp dish.  For dessert we had banana's foster which was as fun to watch as it was on our taste buds.  All paired with a bottle of pinot noir.   The service was top notch. On one occasion I asked one of the servers where the restroom was and he escorted me to the ladies room.  When I walked out of the restroom, and to my surprise, there was the server waiting to escort me back to my table.  It doesn't get any better than that.  We got the royal treatment and Bentley's made our special night a memorable one.",

When I called they asked what the occasion was and I told them it was our anniversary. When we got there they had a great table set up in a private area that felt like they took the extra time to set it up just for us (it was almost in an awkward spot kind of in a corner but almost still I'm the way).  The food was great! We started with the calamari appetizer, which was almost perfect and not chewy like some places. It was a huge appetizer by the way...  I had their Stuffed Shrimp which was basically crab cakes stuffed with large shrimp and my partner got the filet mignon; both dishes were very good.  When we were done with our entrees, they brought out a creme brulee which they said was to celebrate our anniversary and that it was on the house!  I would like to say the view was amazing but it was so foggy we couldn't see much. What we could see was nice though.  We will definitely be back!  P.S. I wish this place was on OpenTable!",

The assistant waiter should have been the head waiter because he knew how to conduct himself the way a waiter in a restaurant of this caliber should. It took us half a hour to have our order taken. Our appetizers arrived half a hour later and our meal arrived a hour later. The assitant waiter was the only one who asked us how our meal was. The hostess and the assistant waiter were the only ones who made us feel welcomed. The head waiter acted as if he was doing us a favor to acknowledge us. We spoke to the owner as we were leaving about the situation. He really acted as though he could care less.",

We thought it would be best to take him here to view the city while we dine with some great food. The bartender - awesome. Hostess - awesome and even all the wait staff except our primary waiter. He was from New York and seemed very rude when asked questions. For example, when asked what ingredients were in the cheesecake he said, \"cream cheese\". We asked another waiter who did diligence in asking the kitchen and came back with a list of three cheeses. Non of which were cream cheese by the way... He also told us that all domestic cheeses are pasteurized and seemed condescending to our question which was asked due to health reasons. (This was not our question but yet he felt the need to school us?) Additionally, the food was so so. For the price you are really paying for the atmosphere not the food. Capital Grille is still (in my opinion) the best fine dining in Charlotte. Perhaps we just got this place on an off night? Bentleys should pay a little more attention to the New York waiter. It could cause loss in clientele such as myself.",

I had a very bland French onion soup (after a couple of spoonfuls, I decided there was no point to eating the rest). The rest had a really excellent salad with brie. Three of us had the bourbon filet, pretty good beef, a twice done potato, not too bad, and our fourth had a sea bass special which he liked quite a bit. It has a old school feel in the meal preparation and plating. My point is that it wasn't really bad, just not up to the standards I would expect from the location and reputation. We probably won't be going back, there are too many other restaurants with better food and, bottom line, that's what we are looking for. For a company outing, where food isn't the main concern, the view and surroundings are great, so perhaps that's where they do most of their business. Mediocre.",

    "text": "My wife and I went tonight as we're moving away from Charlotte and wanted to have a nice dinner beforehand. We ordered the Queen Charlotte Salad, very tasty and fresh though the dressing was a bit too overpowering for my taste buds. We continued with the Chateaubriand for two. I was a bit skeptical as the tenderloin is not usually as flavorful as other cuts of beef. But this was amazing, cooked as ordered with an amazing sauce. The side items included asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, potato dauphinoise. I'll note that the asparagus were cooked to perfection which is not always the case. Anyways, back to the beef. It was as tender as anything and just spectacular, despite not being labeled as prime on the menu. We did had dessert, the creme brulee, which was good. The service was outstanding, our drinks were never left to empty which is a great indication that they're on top of their game. Moreover, the head waiter turnover is minimal, if non existent, assuring consistency in the experience. Coupled with the view and intimate atmosphere, this is hands down among the top restaurant experiences in Charlotte.  The two negatives I see is that the table top cooking is really more for show, as the Chateaubriand and the rest of the meal were already cooked, the table side cooking was just to make the sauce and slightly brown the beef. If advertising as table side then they should stick to it. The other negative is that this is not really a French restaurant, more like an American restaurant with some slight French inspiration. But all said I will note that what they do they do really well. Definitely worth the time and money.",

    "text": "Confidence is magnetic; arrogance is obnoxious.  Bentley's errs on the side of arrogance (especially when it's an unwarranted sense of self-righteousness) and seriously, it left an unsavory damper in our romantic dining experience.  I'm giving Bentley's 3 stars for: 1. AMAZING ambiance (the best in Charlotte); 2. Underwhelming service; and 3. Hit or miss cuisine.   TIP:  There's no valet parking (seriously?!?) so get an uber (like we did) or be prepared to walk.    1.) Amazing ambience.  The view is spectacular.  It's the kind of view that Fahrenheit wishes it could feature but note that you're paying a heftier price tag to enjoy it.  Inside the restaurant, there is a cozy lit oversized fireplace that is extremely warm and welcoming.  The restaurant is dimly lit and candlelit at every table to immerse you in the upscale yet romantic backdrop.                 We sat in a booth adjacent to the window, which really augmented the intimacy of our romantic dining experience.  If you're in LA, this restaurant is akin to WP24, Wolfgang Puck's restaurant.  Like WP24, this is the restaurant that we would take our suburbanite out-of-town guests to understand our draw to downtown living.    2.) Disappointing service.  The waitstaff is comprised of a team of 3 so theoretically, the transition through the courses should be seamless and your needs should be anticipated with an impeccable level of detail.  In application, they just fell flat.  It seemed like they weren't communicating with one another -- and frankly, there weren't that many other patrons in the restaurant so unless they were back in the kitchen acting as cooks as well, it's a little bewildering how this could happen.    For example, we had to ask for certain things at least twice with two different people.                 My drink was prepared inadequately and sent back three times before I just gave up and concluded that the last endeavor was \"good enough.\"  I know that they specialize in wine but I'm not a wino and it can't be that hard for the bartender to put together pineapple, Sprite, and citrus vodka to make it fruity and sweet.  Further,  this seemed discombobulating to the team.               Ultimately, they:               **  couldn't prepare a simple alcoholic concoction;              **  served bad oyster(s);              **  got our order wrong and we had to wait for the right dish to be prepared.  With this whole debacle, the main server at the end of the meal had the audacity to ask us,  \"I trust you enjoyed your meal,\" which seemed more like a flagrant challenge than a genuine intention to ensure that we had a positive dining experience.                 Having both been a waitress and bartender in college, my boyfriend and I have sympathy for how demanding the service industry can be; however, we have dined at Buddha Bar in Dubai, Alain Ducasse in Paris, Providence in LA, STK in Vegas and LA -- you get the gist -- the service at Bentley's was the absolute worst  we've encountered for an upscale restaurant.  Nobody has ever been as presumptive as the staff at Bentley's.  Locally, they can learn from the staff at Capital Grille (\"CG\"), Del Frisco's (\"DF\"), or BLT, who have their service execution down to an exacting science.    3.) Hit or miss cuisine.  We've had:  _______________Absolutely divine hits.   ***  escargot.   The scrumptious way escargot was meant to be served -- buttery, garlicky and not fishy at all.  A top 5 contender for the best I've had globally, including in Paris.  ***  Lobster.  The lobster is foodgasmic good.  I usually prefer Alaskan King crab to lobster but the buttery and sweet delivery of the lobster was mind-blowing.   ***  Caesar salad.  It's deconstructed but the nice balance of lemon, anchovy and Worcestershire sauce along with the crisp lettuce made it on par with other steakhouses like CG, BLT or DF though.   *** Lobster bisque. Great blend of sweet and creamy.  Gives CG's bisque a run for their money.  ______________Meh.  Good but you expect more for the price and projected caliber.  ***  shrimp cocktail.  It's good but they give you 4 shrimps, which is less than CG, DF, or BLT  but not more remarkable.   ***  creme brulee.  Just standard old creme brulee.  Come on!  This is a French restaurant; you can't serve me less caliber than what I get at Georges Brasserie during their brunch buffet!    _____________Miss...WTH?!?  ***  caviar oysters.  I. Love. Oysters.  If they have them;  I'm ordering them.  I've had my share of bad oysters but would never expect to have it served at this caliber of restaurant.  Seriously;  that's unforgivable.  #3 was bad so I couldn't risk trying 4,5 or 6.  They took it off the bill but rightfully so.    Overall, I would come back for the ambiance and the amazing escargot, lobster and salad; but the service was so deplorable that we will opt for CG, BLT or DF over spending another disappointing dining experience at Bentley's.  Get over yourself, Bentley's, you're not THAT great.",

The steak was perfectly cooked and I think the baked potatoes was the best I've ever had in my life lol...yea a little dramatic but it was that good. She had the steak and asparagus. She loved it.

    "text": "We used to love Bentley's, but things have changed since our last visit, and now we will never return again. I should start off by saying my husband and I are extremely easy to please while eating out. We both order the exact same thing, we drink water, order quickly, eat quickly, and tip well. My husband and I made our reservation one week in advance, anticipating a much needed date night without our one year old. We arrived to a building being remodeled and it was difficult finding our way to the restaurant. That issue however, was not the restaurants fault, nor would we blame them for that. We were seated quickly at a table by a window. The issues with our visit began when we were ready to order our meal. I asked the waiter what their side options were and in a snide tone I was told, \"pretty much what you already see on the menu.\" And then was told \"we can't substitute anything tonight anyway.\" So just the one night we are on our date night, they can't substitute any sides. Because of the unhelpful reply's from our waiter, I asked to speak with the manager. The manager made a comment about me as he was walking towards me thinking I couldn't hear him. It was, \"yea I know, she doesn't like the menu\" in a condescending tone. I actually do like the menu. I didn't like the service or not being able to substitute one side item at $50 a plate. I explained to him our service experience and then asked why all of a sudden they don't substitute sides, since they have before every other time we've eaten there. He said he didn't want to substitute sides tonight because last night was so busy. So I had to remind him that it wasn't last night anymore. It was 6:20pm and most tables were empty, so it wouldn't inconvenience the kitchen, at all actually. He then said he would substitute my side if I wanted and when I asked him what my options were, he basically gave me the same reply as the waiter. So at this point, I see why the staff is able to get away with poor service. I called two other restaurants to make a reservation, but they were both booked completely. Keep in mind, Bentley's was still sitting mostly empty at this point, and other restaurants were booked solid for all times. We would have left at this point, but we decided to stick it out since the food has never disappointed us before. We ordered two salads and two filets with substituted sides. We were unimpressed with the quality of meat tonight, which is what we used to love about Bentley's. We actually used to love the whole experience. The service, the food, the view. But now everything has changed, except the view. It has been 3 years since we ate there last, and unfortunately, a lot has changed in that time. The price tag would still suggest immaculate service, incredible food, and an overall amazing experience. It used to. Now, I would highly encourage you to spend your money elsewhere. There are tons of other great restaurant options in Charlotte. This isn't the best choice anymore and I will no longer be recommending it.",

    "text": "I am now convinced that this is the best restaurant for fine dining in Charlotte. The food, the decor, the ambience, the service all deserve thumbs up.  We got to sit on the opposite side from where we sat last time. I loved the view over Charlotte including the Bank of America Corporate Center and the Hearst Tower on one end and the BB&T Ball Park at another corner. We actually got to see the game from our table. Yes, we think we got the best seat in the house. Early birds do catch the worm.  The same person who waited on us last time was one of the three that night. They were all professional and knowledgeable. I always look for, not just manners and confidence, but intellect. Outstanding hall staff know when to interrupt and even make out what you murmur even if it's not clear - and get it right! At least two of the three were super last Saturday night. They recommended the tuna/crab/filet trio for appetizer, which was great, and always had my champagne glass full. But they never came over when we didn't need them after my wife told them that it was our anniversary.  And the food - We had the tuna/crab/filet trio for starter, bourbon filet and shrimp for entree, and got the creme brulee on the house. All amazing. Even my wife, who's not a big steak fan, was awed by my bourbon filet mignon. Her shrimp was great as well. We also ordered a bottle of Moet Chandon after our cocktails were done. We loved it.  I'm sure there are many more foodies and Yelp elites who have experience more restaurants in Charlotte than me; and I do not doubt that some will disagree. But I really vote for Bentley's as the best fine dining restaurant here in Charlotte after going around for 3 years now. It could be my preference. I do like places with a great view, excellent food, and it can't be too loud. The famous steakhouses here are mostly on the first floor, the other one on top of another building is too loud. Yeah, I like this place.",

The bartender was pretty bad. He never welcomed us, just asked what we needed before we even sat down. I then asked for the drink menu, and all he said he had was a wine menu. I thought this was odd but just assumed they just didn't have one. Once we were approached that our table was ready, I asked if I needed to close out our tab. The hostess stated that no, she would just have the bar tab transferred. As we were walking by the bartender, he was yelling out to us to close the tab first. The hostess interrupted him stating she would take care of it. Just a bad way to start off our much anticipated visit to a nice establishment. To top it off, we were handed a drink menu once we sat down.  The rest of our visit was fantastic. Our wait staff was very professional and nice.  The portion sizes were large and so were the views.",

    "text": "My birthday & anniversary with my boyfriend happens to fall back to back. We generally go to a nice restaurant every year to celebrate both these occasions. I was blown away when he told me we were going here for dinner!  I've been to Bentley's on 27th before for a private lunch - many, many years ago.   Shawn had called a few weeks ago & got reservations for 7 PM, as well as told them what we were celebrating (which comes in handy later). We were running a bit late, due to Saturday night traffic downtown. We called ahead & told them we were running a few minutes late, & they were very nice about it.  We got there about 7:20 & were seated right away - on the side of Wells Fargo & NASCAR Hall of Fame. Yes, they tout themselves with nice views of the city (& beyond) & they live up to this claim! Unfortunately, yesterday was rather cloudy & storms were coming, so we saw quite a bit of dark clouds. No fault of Bentley's though!  We knew automatically what we wanted to eat...we started out with the Maine crab cake ($16). Mmmm! It was rather small, but it did us well splitting it.  It was nice & \"meaty\" & the couscous was a nice addition underneath the crab cake. You also get a warm, crusty bread roll - too bad you only get one. The roll was devine. For drinks, my boyfriend got a Jameson on the rocks & I had a pineapple martini ($10 & $12). Delicious!  For our entree, we chose the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere (18 oz. Tenderloin for two, with asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, Potato Dauphinoise - Red Wine Reduction at $72). We could not have made a better choice! It was simply amazing. I have to chalk it up to one of the best meals I've had. The steak & sides are prepared in the kitchen; however, they bring a cooking table out to your dining table.  They plate the sides & do the wine reduction on the cooking table! Such a nice touch! The waiter cut up the steak into generous portions for both of us. The steak was SO tender & cooked to our order of medium well. The asparagus was grilled & tender - delicious. The mushrooms are sauteed & cooked & they were a nice touch with the steak. The potato dish was like sliced, cooked potatoes stacked high, then baked with a light cheese (?) \"crust\" baked on top. It was really good, but very filling.  Our waiter was an absolute pleasure. He was very friendly & attentive. Other wait staff kept our water glasses full & picked up our used plates in a reasonable amount of time.    While we were waiting for the check, our waiter brought out a plate & lit a candle on it.  He said, \"I understand you are celebrating a birthday & an anniversary, so we would like to give you this to help celebrate!\" It was creme brulee. OH MY GOODNESS...it was out of this world!  What a thoughtful surprise! I asked Shawn did he plan this & he said \"no, I'm just as surprised as you are!\" And he was...  All in all, I am extremely happy with Bentley's. While the space isn't huge, they have a good think going here.  But this isn't a \"hey, let's go to Bentley's all the time!\" place...it's extremely pricey. However, it is good for special occasions.",

    "text": "My husband and I have a date night every Wednesday night and decided we would try Bentley's this time. I'd heard many a good review and heard this place \"knows\" their steak. Boy, I was wrong.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess. She found our reservations quickly and had us seated within moments. We were seated with a corner view of the city. THIS IS THEIR SAVING GRACE. The view. The ambiance. Watching the sunset over this beautiful city.  Our waiter was kind, seemed to know his stuff as far as the menu goes! He recommended the Veal Chops and told us the Bourbon Filet was the most popular item (it gets lit on fire at the table). Service is prompt and fast. He had my cocktail and my husbands beer out before we had even decided on a wine for dinner.  My cocktail was good. I ordered a Hendricks Gin Martini with extra olives. Very good.  We ordered a phenomenal bottle of Malbec, the Daily Oysters, Filet Oscar (Rare), and Bourbon Filet (Medium Rare).  The Raw oysters were fabulous. They come served on the half shell on a bed of ice chips, with a mignonette, half a lemon, and cocktail sauce with horseradish. It's hard to mess that up. They were gorgeous and all a very good size.   When our food arrived. I knew I wasn't going to like mine. I ordered the Filet Oscar. It comes topped with lump crab and bearnaise, with mashed potatoes, and asparagus. The first thing I noticed was the bearnaise was SUPER dry. Almost like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10-15 minutes. I cut into the steak, the temp was perfect (Rare), I noticed that there was not a good sear on the steak. I asked our waiter how the steaks are cooked. (Olive oil, s&p, on a flat top, and finished in the oven) Which leads me to wonder how if it's being seared on a flat top and finished in an oven... why there was no sear? The lighting was dim, but when one sears a steak, the meat does not look light brown as if it's been boiled. There were some LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT sear marks that looked more like pepper. I took the crab and bearnaise off the steak because I wanted to see more of the sear/what the steak looked like without the topping and also because the sauce was too dry. Still the boiled brown look. I initially thought they may have used the sous vide technique and maybe didn't sear at a high enough heat. However, the cut of meat was very good and extremely tender. (I asked about this as well. Apparently the chef makes his own cuts.)  -All in all, MY Filet Oscar was sub par. It needed more s&p, a better sear (it should have had a crust like sear), and the sauce was dry.  My husband ordered the Bourbon Filet (medium rare). His came out, they lit it on fire, it looked to have a much better sear than mine did. (Maybe it's because it got lit on fire... LOL) His steak was Rare, not Medium Rare (he doesn't mind eating rare, so that's not a huge deal, but there are some people who are very picky about temp), the bourbon flavor was overwhelming. The steak was also under seasoned like mine was. His twice baked potato was apparently the star of the show.   We finished our meal and our server came to ask if we wanted to order a dessert. I heard you MUST order the Bananas Foster if you come here. Knowing full well that we probably would not come back, we went ahead and ordered it. A different server came to our table to prepare the Bananas Foster. His name was Ray. Ray was an absolute delight. He regaled us with stories from his past and working in different restaurants and one particularly funny story about how he was the reason MJ was standing outside the Ritz in his underwear! Great guy. We talked a lot about cooking and knowing that I was interested, he walked me through step by step while he was making the dish. We had some fun sprinkling cinnamon on the fire while he was flambeing the dish. The Bananas Foster experience was really great. The taste was nothing immaculate or special, but it was a nice end to a rather sub par dinner.   After dinner, the husband and I chatted a little about the food and decided that we were likely to not come back again, but that it was nice to try a place we hadn't been to yet. Maybe, it was a bad night, or maybe it wasn't, but we hope they do improve. The view this place has draws quite a few people, but it would be even better if the food matched the ambiance.  1-5 Ratings: Ambiance - 4 (Great view) Service - 4 (Great service, but it wasn't over the top amazing) Food - 2 (But because I know my way around a kitchen, the food always holds the most weight in any of my reviews)",

Service was AWFUL - owner's kid was rude and messed up all my food. I have allergies and he had no consideration and then boxed up my food with my husband's leftovers so I definitely couldn't eat anything after that. After going here over the course of many years, we will not be back. Terrible service from staff - even the owner seems to come in and do things inadequate; replaced my nice, crystal champagne glass with an old, small and discolored one....after I already started drinking from the bottle we ordered! Perfect views of the city, but does not make up for poor service. Needs a serious revamp in staff and to bring the level of concierge up to this century.",

This past visit was for NYE dinner and we chose our meals from a set menu, which we were unaware of when we sat down, but our palates weren't disappointed.   Appetizers: crab cake (really tasty, though nothing out of the norm for this dish), and the Oysters Benedict (AMAZING!)   Dinner: my husband and I both had the filet mignon, and were quite satisfied. Unfortunately the air vent was blasting right above our table and my meal cooled down significantly at a significant pace. Why the restaurant was blowing cool air on December 31 is beyond me.   Dessert: bananas foster and chocolate cake (pictured). I'm not usually a fan of banana in my desserts, but that was definitely the better choice.   Overall, great experience -- will be back again for another special occasion.",

A little background; my boyfriend was surprising me with a dinner date there tomorrow for my 30th birthday. He previously made a reservation via email for this occasion and received a confirmation email back. He received an email and a call today at 8pm stating that they would not be able to accommodate us due to a \"human error.\" The first person he spoke with, Allison, was very sincere in her apology but did not offer a solution. I then called back and asked for a manager. As a previous GM of an extinguished restaurant, I am aware things happen but there is always something you can do to make the situation better. As I explained the situation and expressed my concern, Carl was no help at all, at the same time he seemed annoyed about my call and was extremely rude on the phone. He offered no type of solution until I asked for one and it was not accomendating to us since we live out of town. I asked for the General Manager's name and he only gave me his first name and then told me his last name was not needed. His name is clearly on their website so there is no reason why he could not have given it to me. I am just very disturbed on how they treated us in this situation and they are suppose to be a high class restaurant. Very unacceptable for any restaurant.",

    "text": "We had the best dining experience last weekend at Bentley's. This restaurant exceeded my high expectations with the outstanding service and phenomenal food not to mention the spectacular view!    Our night started with a call to the restaurant to hold our table while we found transportation into the city. I had never realized how much we depend on Uber until their platform was down and we were scrambling to find a plan B! Bentley's was very accommodating and was happy to hold our table. Thankfully we weren't more than 10 minutes after our reservation time.  The hostess led us to a booth by the window with a great view of Charlotte. I could see South Park from my seat and the boyfriend could see the Knights game. We started with water and reviewed the drink menu. I loved that the booths at this restaurant were set a couple feet away from the windows and from other booths. The wait staff was able to slip in almost unnoticed to refill glasses and clear plates the whole night.   We started the night with the Bentley's Oysters which were floated with Rose Champagne and topped with creme fresh and White Sturgeon caviar. These were the best oysters I have ever had. So decadent, so delicious!    For our main we decided on the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere, which was a wait but completely worth it! The tableside preparation was a great touch that added to the presentation of the meal. The sauce the server poured over the meat after he flambeed it was amazing.  This is one of the few restaurants in Charlotte that maintains exceptional standards which enhance the special event experience of dining here. This restaurant has shot to the top of my list of splurge night out dining.   PS the cocktails were reasonably priced, my Bentley's Martini (pineapple inflused vodka as the base) was only $12. For an opportunity to take in such an amazing view in a classy atmosphere I will probably be back for a cocktail fairly soon.",

I will echo other reviews and say the view is amazing. I wasn't really into the decor. I loved the fire places but the Christmas decorations seemed a little dated. We arrived and our young server seemed very nervous and an older employee kept reprimanding him which was awkward. We ordered our dishes and everyone loved their food. I ordered the trout and I was most impressed with the mashed potatoes. The fish was a little salty. Overall good dining experience, it took forever to get the check. I don't think I would ever come here on my own dime.",

From the calamari and prawn appetizers, lemon drop martini, lobster bisque soup, fried Brie salad, bourbon filet mignon with twice baked potatoes and veggies and bananas foster dessert - they were just fantastic. This is me just being picky, but next time I would order the filet mignon minus the bourbon. I felt the cut and the seasonings didn't need anything further. I still ate it and enjoyed it thoroughly. Too bad the restaurant is moving locations by next week - the views here are simply breathtaking and that will be sorely missed. The staff also mentioned the menu will be different so we're looking forward to seeing what's to come!",

There are white table clothes, mis en place, and the actual view you get from the twenty-seventh floor is great too. All the food I had was great. I tried the calamari, caviar, and mussels for appetizers and for my entree I had the Holland Dover Sole.  I would recommend all of those dishes. Everyone else in my party liked their food too.  This place is very much your typical extremely high end steakhouse with an interest in caviar. I would recommend going earlier in the evening (before 7:30 pm). Our reservation was for 8:30 and while there were people there, I think this place sees most of it's action earlier and for me it's always nicer to walk into a more lively restaurant. They also close the kitchen at 9:15.",

    "text": "Bentley's delivered a wonderful and memorable meal for our anniversary this past August.  I've thought a long time before writing my review.  Was I just captivated in the moment?  Starry-eyed and amazed?  I mean we've been married 40 years, so yes, all these emotions are still True (my wife is the most fantastic woman, for sure).  On our anniversary we usually dust off the wallet and do something expensive as well as go someplace new to us.  OK, Bentley's on 27th, your turn.  We ordered both the Escargot Bourguignon and Oyster's Bentley as our appetizers.  Pow!  We're off and running with developed flavors, perfect presentation, and culinary excellence.  The main course I ordered the Bourbon Flavored Mignon, a classic they light on fire for all to ooh and aah.  I was entertained, and the steak was cooked perfectly, as one expects.  Lori chose the Lobster Louis-Pernod, with pumpkin sage ravioli, roasted pine nuts, and their lobster Pernod sauce.  Of course, it also has its own little show table side, too.  When our meal was over, we voted, and the cow beat the lobster by a nose; fun was had by all.  Really, really, good.  Our servers, Dawn and Jordan, were simply spectacular.  Nothing went unnoticed and unattended.  Yet, happily they managed to keep their distance and let us love birds celebrate privately our good fortune and God's blessings.  Attn management:  Give these guys a Christmas bonus, they earned it.  The verdict:  looking to spend some change and get it back with class, elegance, and style--plus great food?  Way up on my \"Give 'em a Whirl\" meter.  Celebrate here!",

    "text": "Ignore the negative reviews on this amazing restaurant. After reading some of them I have no idea how they were even eating in the same place.  On our arrival we were greeted by a very polite and personable host (possibly Allison, I'm terrible with names). When she found out we were celebrating our anniversary, she told the waiter to give us \"the best seat in the house\". We were led to a pair of seats in the corner window overlooking the city with a stunning view and privacy.   Our waiters were personable and attentive- some of the best service I've had at any fine dining establishment. My wife and I are both in our 20's but the one thing we love to splurge on is food. Often times at these kinds of restaurants the staff can be pretentious due to our age, and that was not at all the case here.   The food was fantastic. To start we had the Crab cake over cous-cous with a pea puree. If we had been at home I would've licked the plate. 10/10  For my entree I had the Mixed Grille with Australian Lamb Chop, Bison hanger steak and Filet Mignon, grilled veggies and a potato croquette. Everything was phenomenal but the steak was literally perfect. 10/10  My wife had the \"Taste of Hawaii\" which today was a pan seared sea bass with lobster, asparagus and a potato cake. The fish was perfectly cooked and everything paired nicely with the sauce. 10/10  The staff surprised us with a complimentary desert for our anniversary, mascarpone cream puffs and macaroons, beautifully plated with chocolate and caramel. 10/10  Despite being stuffed at this point, I finished with an order of sorbet which included lemon, raspberry and mango sorbet with fresh strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. It was delicious and the perfect portion size. 10/10  My wife and I have eaten at Relais & Chateaux restaurants, Michelin Star restaurants, and had chefs tasting with world famous chefs and we are both in agreement that Bentley's on 27 is our favorite meal we've ever had. We're already planning our next trip back. We would LOVE to see a chefs tasting menu or something similar in the future! Thanks for a great evenings",

You'll have no problem spending well in excess of $100 for two people. The food is good as far as high end restaurants go. We both ordered the filet which was decent. I still think it's a bit overpriced for what you receive. But if you're in the market for high end you could do worse.",

Fantastic selection of top notch caviar, a traditional service with knowledgeable and attentive waiters, fantastic beverages and very classic flavors. My lamb ordered medium rare came out raw and needed to be brought up. That always bothers me that at time dining if an order is not correct it should be redone as a whole not take a rack of lamb half cooked and cut into and then cooked up to temp, my meal shouldn't suffer because of your mistake. Regardless everything other than that was exceptionally well done.",

Went here just once for lunch and had the whole place to ourselves.   The ambiance was something straight out of American Psycho ( Thinking Dorsia) except no need to grab a reservation for lunch on a Monday.  Got the rib-eye steak sandwich and couldn't believe the portion size given the $15 price point.  It was very good for lunch and we also had the fried calamari which was delicious as well.  Overall I'll be back but maybe just once every quarter as this is a HEAVY lunch.  We had a seat right by the window which I probably would have paid another $15 just to get that view of Uptown again (wow, seriously impressive).  Food:  4/5 Ambiance:  5/5 Service:  5/5 View:  10/5  Will be back next quarter!",

Jackets are recommended for gentlemen but not required.  Definitely plenty of space for large parties, rehearsal dinners etc...  This is a really nice view from their bar and restaurant.  A beautiful space for drinks or dinner!  Right away at the hostess desk, the girl was super welcoming and happy to let us relax in the bar for awhile.    Susan in the bar was also very welcoming and attentive.  A great view is such a part of the experience here.  The decor is very neutral and understated.  We had a lovely booth table with amazing views.  It was a great evening weather-wise and we could see the baseball field in one direction and all the way to Ballantyne in another.  The bacon-wrapped shrimp were  delicious.  It was fun to get the flamed bourbon filet and it was beautifully rare.  Both filets were cooked perfectly and the sides were good as well.  They are very sweet to bring out a birthday creme brulee, but we also ordered the tableside bananas foster.  It's not an every day dinner place, but very nice for special occasions or great impressions.  Definitely will go back to see Susan for drinks and the view!",

The prices match the quality of service, the ambiance, the views, the exceptional service and definitely the portions. Like many others, I Started off with the pineapple Martini and hubby got the Bentley's Bee's Knees whisky. Both were so smooth and subtle that we forgot they were cocktails! Next we ordered the Bentley's Oysters (a must!!) and finally decided on the bourbon filet (with the twice baked potato) and the lamb. Both dishes  were   Extremely savory and the table side finisher of the filet is a nice touch. This is a steakhouse. No artisanal flavors, no farm to table fluff. Just good ' steak and potatoes. Yum! We ended the night with a complimentary dessert and espresso! We wished we could taste a dessert but we were way too full!",

We ordered the calamari (I wasn't a great fan of it), bourbon steak, Alaskan king crab and drinks: lemonade cocktail and the whiskey sour cocktail (also, not the best). There were ups and downs in our experience cuisine-wise, and there was a restaurant hospitality disconnect with having 2 waiters, but they anticipated almost every request. Nevertheless, it's an iconic place to dine at downtown and granted everyone will have their own unique experience.",

    "text": "Went early on Saturday night 6.30, place was basically empty \"I know it's early for most\" Beautiful restaurant with views of city. Ok now the good. bentleys oysters fabulous! Escargot fabulous! she crab soup not hot needed salt. Wife had Dover sole fabulous \"but eggplant really\". I had hawaiian sea bass fabulous! see not so good next. 1. Hostess with long black hair didn't smile \"at all\" or even say good evening. Wow really? first impression not going well. 2. We were facing the glass with our backs to dining room \"our choice\". When waiter came he stood behind me to my right to talk. I could not make eye contact with him. Wife said why didn't you turn and look at him? I said he could have taken 2 steps forward to address us plenty of room on both sides of this table. He also did not tell us his name when we were greeted had to ask Taylor. Just my personal pet peeve. Other than that he was very fast and stealth. 3. Another Waiter that brought out Dover sole used 2 forks to filet. I would say using a large serving spoon would have been more effective as he struggled to filet the fish.  4. This is for the owner if you read reviews. Sea bass was superb, but the risotto cake NOT. my first bite of the cake with the fish was very \"dry\", over seared and crunchy then finished gummy. I first thought it was bones and my waiter was there and asked, so I told him whats the crunch bones? He said \"everything else ok\". So I didn't eat anymore of the crunch patty after that. Wife confirmed it was not good. Told Taylor after the meal to share with the Chef. In my humble opinion a classy lobster risotto would have sent the dish over the edge. Good concept just not executed well. A better approach may have been, can I have the Cake \"and dish\" redone or would another side be better? OK enough banter sorry. In Taylor defense he did bring out complementary dessert that was fabulous. Only negative with that was we were full as we ate a lot of food.  5. Back to the hostess talking at the podium with another server and lady who seemed to be a mgr. Wife asked for ladies room and the mgr lady pointed it out \"she was smiling\" as the 3 of them were discussing embarrassing another employee about something while I waited on my wife. No (how was dinner? thanks for coming, have a nice evening!  SUMMARY will we come back? Yes but not for everyday dinner very expensive which I knew before hand. Menu is awesome right up our alley. I am an old school Chef and this type of service was my training ground.",

We then had salads- my companion had the house salad which was great and I had the Cesar salad. The Cesar was good but I wish they would cut the salad for the costumer and make it slightly less fishy. It was just a tab overpowering taste. Then we got our main dishes. The steak was cooked to perfection - the mashed potatoes were amazing but maybe needed more gravy. Asparagus was brilliant. My one complaint was that the service was probably a 3 at best. It took a long time to get plates to be picked up - our waiter seemed to be confused at times and just not the best service. Overall you are looking at a pretty expensive meal but so good!",

Jason has been our server each time, and has done an excellent job ! He is very pleasant and helpful in finding foods we would enjoy.   BEFORE DINNER.. Complementary Roll- They serve either a white or wheat fresh warm roll. I don't care for the butter, a butter, honey, garlic mixture. Instead I order regular butter.   Salads - Cesar Salad - ok              - Romaine & buffalo mozzarella - ok.                  The cheese was the best part Dressing... They only have 2 primary choices Cesar- not very good Champagne vinaigrette - too acidic the first time, but loved it the second time.  Oil & Vinegar - oil was so so  Gin-a-tonic with Hendrick-just right the first time! Very good! They were out of my primary drink this this evening.   DINNERS.. Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, Zucchini, Squash & Green beans- Delicious!!!! ......The potatoes were just perfect & nice and creamy! The zucchini was grilled but you really couldn't taste anything charred. The Green beans were crisp with just the right amount of parsley.   Bourbon flamed Filet w/ Twice baked potato and carrots- Amazing! My friend loved it!!  .......My friend thought the filet was very good, but the Bourbon flavor was a little overwhelming.    Veal with guda mashed potatoes- my friend said the mashed potatoes were the best part of her meal.   DESSERT.. Mango, raspberry, & lemon sorbet that came with strawberries and blueberries- Incredible!!!!   Creme Brulee- Excellent!! Really nice, served complementary for my friend's birthday.",

The most special place, overlooking the city on the 27th floor. We saw places we didn't know were there, from the beautiful dining room. Their service is outstanding and though  their menu is not huge it is full of delicious choices that they do very well.. Every one ordered a soup or salad except me ( I had to wear my dress out of the place later) The servings were generous and everything was delicious (The  Clam Chowder was very good I was told by the master soup eater) We had 2 bottles of Merlot for our table which were reasonably priced for a place like this and a couple of cocktails that were well balanced in alcohol vs mix. The birthday boy ordered the Dover Sole, which they de-bone tableside. Their French Table service was outstanding, as with the Caesar's Salad done tableside. The Salmon I had was perfectly prepared with just the right amount of blistering on the outside and a tender flesh on the inside. The Crabcake Mama had was perfectly shaped considering what little filler they used and delicious as well. We ended with a Creme Brulee we shared and 4 chocolate Martinis which were delish and make me want one now.  They have a  wine list,  a specialty drink menu, and a dessert menu as well as a Dinner menu. Not at all cheap but well worth it!",

After she completed the exam decided we needed to celebrate so I checked the reviews and off we went to Bentleys on 27. We arrived a little early so we had a cocktail in the bar. When your 27 floors up you can see for miles! After a short time we were seated. The dinning room is very nice. Elegant table setting, service was fast and consistent. Now I have to point out that we were the only table in the entire section. If possible request a table by the window. The view is great! My daughter ordered the filet and shrimp which looked wonderful, and it went well with her champagne. Wife had a salad from appetizer menu. Sorry but I don't recall what type it was but she did say it was delicious! I had the dover sole over vegetables with what tasted like a lemon sause and absolutely loved it! We all enjoyed the experience at Bentleys on 27 and would recommend it to friends and family should they find themselves in Charlotte. We are here for four mites and may go here for dinner again.

We went for New Years Eve for their special dinner and there were 3 in our party.  My husband and myself had not been for several years.  Last time we went it was superb.  This time, we took an out of town friend to really treat her to a special New Year's Eve night out on the town of dinner and a play at the Belk Theatre to see Kinky Boots.  We were hugely disappointed and embarrassed at the price of the meal and the level of service we received where you expect it to be superb and first rate. Our filets were very tasty, the ribeye was well done as well, but the lobster was tough and overcooked.  The mashed potatoes served were watery and had no flavor.  Same for the tiny bit of spinach that came as well. No flavor and watery. When asked if another potato option could be replaced for the one that came with the most expensive lobster and filet meal, we were told that it could happen, but an extra charge would need to be added to our bill because it would be considered ordering an extra side item.  Sorry, but at $115 for the entree, we said no thank you to that.  Better customer service is expected and we were embarrassed our friend even saw this reaction from a highly rated downtown Charlotte restaurant. Any other restaurant would have gladly brought a better replacement side item to make a customer happy with the whole meal at NO EXTRA CHARGE.  The appetizers were just ok....not very big portions on the crab soup or our friends lobster appetizer.  Our main waiter never came back to our table to ask how the food was after the main entree was brought out.  We finally asked one of the other waiters about the potatoes.  Our main waiter was busy making lengthy conversations with another table and we felt ignored honestly.  Wish I could write a better review for Bentleys 27, but with spending over $400 for 3 people to eat, we expected a lot more.  There are numerous wonderful restaurants downtown and in the Charlotte area...all of which are much less expensive and much better quality food, better service, and where customers are truly valued for coming there.  We will not be going back or recommending this restaurant ever again.",

The food was great while being a bit overpriced.  I had the Chicken Paillard featuring Ashley Farms chicken breast with goat cheese risotto. Veggies were a great medley of grape tomatos, artichokes, zucchini, carrots and butternut squash. Crisp textures with creamy risotto and tender chicken, awesome!

This means you have to park in a parking garage and walk over to the building which isn't a great \"mood setter\" to start.  After that, getting off the elevator on 27, it's very easy to find.  Was greeted by two hostesses and promptly taken to the table.  I was worried we wouldn't be able to get a window seat, but that wasn't a problem.  The view was wonderful even for a city the size of Charlotte.  Appetizer consisted of Filet, Shrimp and Tuna.  All excellent!  I ordered the Bourbon Filet, but must say I was out ordered by the grouper!  The grouper was magnificent.  Had a nice bottle of Pinot Noir after a very tasty dirty martini.  Overall, very nice experience.  I'd highly recommend.",

We met with the event coordinator, Kay Emad, and squared away all details for the day. She seemed aloof and really unconcerned with our details. This was evident in the way she neglected to write down any of our requests. Kay assured me that every detail we discussed would be met on the day of. When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve.",

    "text": "Worth EVERY penny!  This is my favorite super-fancy place to eat in Charlotte.  Inside the Charlotte Plaza Building (some call it Darth Vader building!) located on the 27th floor.  They offer services I will never be rich enough to partake in - like keeping a wine locker for you stocked!    The boyfriend took me here for Valentines Day and I had only previously been for lunch or drinks - which were fantastic.  The view is stunning.  I remember the lunch portions being HUGE and delicious.  For dinner tho we started with the Oysters Bentley.  At $14 bucks they were worth it I have to say.  Fresh ingredients made this boring dish extraordinary.  What is the difference between this dish and Stuffies?  It is the same thing except Oysters Bentley sounds so much sexier.  Same idea - oysters removed from the shell and mixed with spinach and stuffing and put back in the shell for presentation.  Excellent.  I was really full at this point but we carried on to dinner.  The tableside Chateaubriand Bouquetiere is a huge steak seared at your table.  Yay fire!  So fun.  Served with veggies and Potato Dauphinoise (Picture a neat bundle of scalloped potatoes).  We obviously could not even get close to finishing our meal because it was so much food.  Probably 4 people could eat this.  It was never ending.    The only thing I think was not worth it was the Grown Up Macaroni.  Touted as lobster and truffles and three cheeses it sounds like it will be the best part of the meal.  If they changed the noodle and added more sauce it may have been a little bit better.  The lobster was fine, the truffle sauce was delish.  Just the whole thing together was a bit boring - especially if you have ever had the Lobster Mac and Cheese at Capital Grill.  Not even close.  Stunning experience - wine, service, food.  I need to increase the max purchase amount on my credit card to eat here again.  Let's just say it is a once-a-year splurge and the rest of the year just give me a beer and let me look out the window.",

In any case, Bentley's on 27 offers a wonderful dining experience with a great view.   We started with the Oysters Bentley (yum) and Tuna carpiccio. We had stuffed shrimp and halibut dishes for our entree. Both of which were beautifully executed! Our wine selection was Far Niente (an excellent wine for those who don't care for overly buttery/ too-heavily-oaked Chardonnay). Instead of dessert, we opted to have Port and Cognac after dinner... ahh... the good life! However, as we were there for a birthday celebration, we did end up njoying a birthday sweet after all!   Throughout the evening, our server was very attentive, entertaining, and was a True professional - which sadly, in this day & age is no longer a given (even at this level of restaurant).

But apparently when she only ordered a glass the waiter put us on his \"2nd Class\" list for that night.    The food was excellent.  I would give that 5 stars by itself.  But the service was just horrible.  I had to ask 3 times before I received my ice tea.  While we were eating dessert, the waiter walked by and tossed the bill on the table.  No offer for coffee or an after dinner drink.  I will not be returning.  After reading a lot of other reviews, I am not the first to experience this poor service at Bentley's.

No apologies for the mistake and the girls were rude.  This was March 7.  Think place needs to teach their staff some manners.  Needless to say went somewhere else.     We ended up at Flemings Steakhouse.   The food was awesome and they treated us very special!!!!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE service from receptionist to wait staff to general manager. Food was ok but couldn't get past the service. Felt like we were intruders. They would not validate parking bc ...they ran out?  Parking is $17.00 in parking deck noted on their website, only added salt to the injury. Stay away, plenty of other great restaurants uptown that are happy to have your business.",

    "text": "Was just here for a wedding, and oh my, was it fun!  What a cool spot for an event!  The food was really great (those shrimp... were HUGE!).  Dinner was heavy hors d'oeurves with a carving station and luckily, we chose a spot right by the shrimp/brie/delicious table.  The view... SPECTACULAR!  And the decor meshed really well with what my friend chose for her theme (although, she IS a wedding planner, so maybe that was on purpose :P)  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that there was that the waiters kept walking in between our conversation (although, we may have been standing in not such a good spot, but whatever.)  And the dance floor was a little tiny.  Otherwise, though, SPECTACULAR.  ...and way out of my price range, normally, so don't expect an updated review until I win the lottery.",

    "text": "Lat night I had dinner at Bentleys,  delicious food, and a nice presentation.  View was amazing and aperance of resturant was a bit dated, but the view made up for it.  The service was good, as she came at the right time, and left us alone when we were talking.  Spent about 350 for two people including a nice wine, impressive wine list.  My complaint is that when we left a little after nine, there were people in the bar area right off the dining room in shorts and flip flops.  You cant be a 5 star resturant with the prices you demand and not enforce a dress code.  There were several couples celebrating an anniversary or special occasion and they were really dressed up, so I can imagine what they thought when they walked by the guys in shorts.  Shame on the young lady at the front door that allowed them in, dressed that way.  Step it up Bentleys, your not a sports bar !!!!!",

    "text": "One undeniable fact about Bentley's is of course, the the grand view and ambiance. If you get seated next to the window (and please ask for a window seat), you won' t be disappointed. They will seat next to each other to be romanced by Uptown's mesmorizing skyline. When we get to the food and service though, slightly unimpressive.  The Valentines day experience had the prefix dinner and a classy lounge band singing some classic slow dance tunes that all age groups would appreciate. When we get down to food and service, I can't really say I was courted ever so eloquently.   While the food and service was A-okay, truth be told, they really aren't up to par in comparison to the prime real estate.",
