    "text": "I went to Pikes with a group of friends for Sunday brunch which was a buffet. Having worked in restaurants before I tend to pay attention to the cleanliness of a restaurant and especially on a buffet I'm cautious about how safe the food appears to be to eat.    There were items I stayed away from because I didn't feel they were safe. For example, the cold salads that were sitting on top of an ice well. They should have been sunk into the ice to cover most of the container.   I touched the outside of one of the containers and it was room temperature.  No thanks I'll pass.   And then there was the sneeze guard over the lunch items (sort of off to the side) it looked like a relic from the 1920s complete with a plexiglass cover that you could barely see through it was so scratched and smudged.   I couldn't bring myself to eat anything from underneath that relic of the past.   But the worst thing was the uncovered pan of (I hope!) discarded meat from the roast beef sitting on the floor behind the buffet.  Disgusting!  No wonder I had to shoo flys away from our table.     The items that I did have were:  Bacon -- it was bits and pieces of bacon not strips.  Very greasy.    Biscuit and gravy - biscuit was good.  Gravy was blah  Hash brown casserole - good.  Best thing I had.   Eggs Benedict - OK \"A\" for effort here but honestly don't serve Eggs Benedict on a buffet.  Just don't.   Chocolate cake -  I take it back THIS was the best thing I had.    To be fair my friends said they enjoyed the food and thought it was a pretty good buffet.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, and already I have decided that I absolutely LOVE this place.  Because it's a soda shop, the decor is old-fashioned and reminiscent of my childhood days when the last of the soda shops and pharmacies were fading away.  The music played was mostly 50s and early 60s.  They even have a soda (and booze) bar at the front of the restaurant, where you can order a variety of soda and ice cream drinks.  My first trip was on Sunday for brunch.  For $13.95 (which may seem like a lot, until you try the quality of food on the buffet), you get access to a buffet with all kinds of goodies.  In addition to the traditional eggs and breakfast meat, you can choose muffins or pastries, a hashbrown casserole, eggs benedict, some french toast casserole thing, and fresh fruit.  After 10 AM, they also feature lunch dishes, including roast beef, soup, salad dishes, and pasta.  Finally, they offer a range of desserts to go with all of that, in case you haven't eaten enough pastries or other sweet things on the buffet.    You don't like buffets?  No problem for brunch!  You also have the option of ordering omelets, quiche, and pancakes as well, not to mention lunch items.  My second trip I went  for dinner.  I ordered the salmon caesar salad and fried pickles, and my friend got their pot roast dinner.  Both were quite delicious - the salad was filling without being too big.  The fried pickles were so good - cut somewhat thick with a tasty Southern batter.  I decided to order the Tollhouse Pie for dessert - it was so good, I'm convinced I could have eaten a whole pie in one sitting!  She had the carrot cake, which was delicious with a lighter cream cheese icing.  And the best part is that most of the dinners are $10-$15, which is quite reasonable.  Both times, we had awesomely friendly servers, both of whom were quite attentive.  My only gripe about this place is the parking situation.  Unfortunately, they do not have a parking lot that I could find; it's all street parking.  While there is a decent amount of parking, you have to fight traffic in the evenings to get to the parking, and I'm sure it becomes very difficult to find the busier they get.  Still, it's right off the light rail, so it would be super easy to park somewhere else and just take the light rail there.  I can see this being one of my regular places to eat.",

In no time we were called to a booth, and looking around the decor was so interesting. All sorts of Pepsi memorabilia and old Pharmacy equipment.   On Wednesdays the soup of the day is tomato, which I paired with the 3 cheese grilled cheese. It was awesome. The waiter was awesome. The only thing that wasn't awesome was the parking, I had to parallel park. I am from Charlotte I cannot parallel park. Easy solution, ride the light rail. It's right there.",

We had family in town this weekend - you know,  one of those situations when the kids outnumbered the adults.  We wanted a place that was accommodating for a party of around 20 with affordable options that could suit varying tastes.  Pike's checked all the boxes beginning with their ability to seat us in their private dining room with very little notice (called about an hour in advance).  Having tiered buffet pricing for adults and kids was a huge bonus and very family friendly weekend brunch option.  I almost forgot to mention the food - it was simply delicious with all the brunch staples and a few bonus surprises - sweet potato casserole, their fruit salad and the small pieces of cake were big hits.  I rarely post online but I was so impressed with our excellent experience that I had to recommend Pike's as an awesome option for families, big kids and little kids alike.",

I sat at the soda counter which was cool and my server was Kyle who was nice enough.  I signed up for their rewards program, got points for my milkshake purchase and also earned a first-timer award good for a free dessert or appetizer on my next visit!! SCORE!!

As I understand, it is in the South End part of the city. I was glad he made the suggestion, as I and my friends had a great brunch experience.  The facade is a nice brick one, looking like another trendy place to go for eats or to hang out in the city, liked how it looked going in. Once inside, you are treated to a interior much more on the old fashioned side as the name suggests. Great look as an old time soda shop combined with a nice dining area on both sides. Very welcoming in design and look. I liked the atmosphere it gave.  As I said, we went for Sunday brunch, which is a buffet there. Man, it was some good stuff. Healthier fare such as fruit, cereals, or light breads, even to scones and a very light coffee cake. For more hardcore eaters, carnivores, and breakfast traditionalists (that would be me), there are eggs, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, french toast, biscuits and gravy, grits, etc. There is also a side station for other main meals faves such as a wonderful beef carved as you come up to ask for it. Most everything I had was great, definitely a three plate brunch for me. The grits were a bit thin and my buds were not wild about the green beans but all in all, it was a great selection and meal.  I recommend going by Pike's for the Sunday Brunch buffet...good price (below 15 bucks as I remember) , great food, and nice staff. I will go back!",

Very flavorful with just the right of spice and a generous portion of gravy covered my loaf and mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were some of the best also to compliment my meatloaf.  The disappointment came from the green beans.  They looked unappetizing like they were cooked too long or came directly from a can with that grayish green color.

Ordered: chicken tenders/fries and green beans + thin mint milkshake.   Tenders and fries were both pretty soggy. The breading on a chicken tender should be crispy. They're honestly the quality I'd expect out of a freezer, even fast food places have better texture.   There's literally no seasoning in the breading of the tender or seasoning on the fries. So they're soggy and lack taste.   This would all be ok for me if I could dip them in sauce. I got one, half-filled cup of honey mustard. I got through about 2 tenders (out of 6) before I was out of dipping sauce. Didn't even get to dip the fries. Why sell a tender/fry combo and provide only one measly filled dipping cup?   Green beans were ok. Milkshake was good. Only good the milkshakes here, the food isn't very good.",

I had a build your burger on a salad bowl...the burger was delicious! Super flavorful, good portion sizes and I appreciated the option for fruit on the side instead of fries. This place has malts, homemade milkshakes, desserts, etc. There was a chocolate cake in the dessert case that had cake slices the size of your head...it was crazy! We each decided to indulge in a milkshake for the road. The chocolate was delicious, since they use their homemade chocolate ice cream for it there wasn't the overly sweet syrup, make you sick to your stomach chocolate syrup taste. As for parking we parked on the road (pay to park) but were able to find a space pretty easily. Will definitely come back!!!",

    "text": "Welp, that makes two disappointing meals from Pike's.  The first time, wanting to try a new place, we tried the Thanksgiving turkey, mashed potatoes, etc dish. We also ordered a veggie plate, which never showed. First off, the portions were tiny. $14 for a meal about the size of the tray I used to have to eat in middle school. The taste and effort put into the food seemed about on par, as well. I LOVE the quintessential Thanksgiving spread, and I would never ever order this again, The Oreo milkshake, however, was pretty good. Dairy Queen is better, though, if you're looking for an Oreo kick.  The second time, I felt like a milkshake. I ordered the Oreo milkshake (with malt, I though)... and my milkshake had neither malt nor Oreo. It did, however, have chunks of ice, and it tasted like when ice cream defrosts and then gets re-frozen. It's lost that creamy consistency and is just sort of sweet and powdery/icy. What the heck? Food? Per someone's review, the Honey Pecan Fried Chicken was a must-try. Let me tell you, it's really not. It's a slab of chicken which by itself is pretty tasteless. The size and the texture of the \"slab\" was again on par with middle school cafeteria food. The honey pecan is simply a really watered down syrup with chunks of pecan in it. Really? What a disappointment. Mashed potatoes tasted like they were either really pretty old or they were made from a box. Broccoli casserole was just really salty. And that was $11!   If you are the kind of person who typically enjoys sub-par food, microwave TV dinners, and disappointing cafeteria food, this is the place for you.   Don't expect your order to be made correctly, and don't expect wonderful food. Expect a lot of sugar and calories that weren't worth the time and effort you spent masticating.",

Initially I ordered a black bean burger, but it was sorta mushy and didn't have a good taste to it. I sent it bk and got a salad, fried okra, and green beans. The okra wasn't bad. I took two bites of the salad, tried one bean, and ate a few pieces of the okra. I was obviously displeased with my food, but I was still charged full price, even extra for guacamole on a burger that I didn't even eat. Oh well, I probably won't go back, but the waiter was handsome and smelled nice.",

And it all could have been what I ordered...but for me this place was just okay. I'm allergic to pecans so their signature dish of Honey Pecan Chicken was out....but since I just had to try their milkshakes I opted for a chocolate shake and the Panther Burger (Black and Blue) with fries.   I substituted a turkey burger for their regular patty. The burger comes only topped with blue cheese but I added lettuce and onions. For me it was just too dry and I could have used a little more seasoning. But the milkshake was tasty, very thick thick and creamy and the fries were crispy and hot. But overall I'm saying A-Ok.   I'm totally willing to give them another chance, order something different and have another milkshake. So stay tuned for the update!",

Usually so quick to refill dishes, several pans stood empty the whole time we were there. Many of the others were barely warm.  The gentleman at the door very politely greeted us and held the door for new arrivals. On a cold morning, with no  lids on some of the trays, eggs Benedict get cold pretty fast.  Things were so different, I wonder if there's new management and they're still adjusting.  In any case, we'll wait awhile before we visit this former favorite again.",

The grilled cheese is really pretty awesome!  It's got two kinds of oozy, gooey super melted cheese on it.  And when I ask for it to be well done, it comes out perfect, yay!  The pecan fried chicken is another good one.  Its sweet and savory, and all kinds of bad for you but hey sometimes you gotta splurge!  It comes with a broccoli casserole which is also delicious, and the mashed potatoes, which I do not love.  But that's okay you can sub a different side for $1!  Desserts are very tempting.  So far though I have resisted, except I was given a slice of the mousse cake for my bday fro my boss, how could I say no to the boss??  Its a cheesecake with layers of the chocolate mousse, it was really silky and smooth tasting, very decadent and very delicious.  Luckily I had co-workers help me eat it.  The prices are very reasonable here.  Service is hit or miss.  I feel like they just drop you check right after you get your food, which is odd because I eat lunch at off peak times so its not like they need the table.  No matter, I sit and read and enjoy my food and leave when I am ready.  Otherwise, everything else is great!",

One table features traditional breakfast items like grits, blueberry French toast, eggs benedict (not the best since English muffins get tough after sitting around for awhile), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, fruit salad and fluffy biscuits to serve as a vessel in a sea of sausage gravy. The other table featured roast beef, sweet potato casserole, brocoli casserole, black eyed peas, and green beans. And if you save room for dessert, there are tiny morsels of freshly baked carrot cake, red velvet cake and key lime pie.   Service is great and beverage glasses never got low. Plates were continously cleared away.   I am a big fan and can't wait to go back.",

That's all I get when I go there. #3 The people and atmosphere. Like hearing yourself? Enjoy super nice wait staff? Don't want to feel crowded or have to wait? They got you covered. #4 The shakes.

    "text": "On a recent business trip to Charlotte, we had lunch at Pike's, per someone that used to be a local.  As soon as you walk in, you feel like you're in an old tried and True soda shop.  The place was packed at for lunch and as much as we wanted a solid lunch before heading back to Charleston, the dessert display and menu was hard to ignore-- cakes, pies, cobblers, ice cream, sundaes, milkshakes, malts, sodas... oh my.   After much contemplation I ordered the vegetable plate.  Not to worry, the only reason I did was so that one of my sides could be the mac and cheese (a special that day).  The sweet potatoe casserole was just as good as my mom's, the greenbeans were awesome, and even my side salad didn't dissapoint.  Everyone else got the hot turkey plate (massive portions of stuffing, mashed potatoes, turkey and gravy) and the pecan fried chicken (boneless chicken breast breaded in a crispy pecan crust and choice of side).  Everything was homemade, delicious, and not a single one of us could finish.   Then dessert.  I skipped, but fortunately my friend with the Tollhouse pie was very generous.  It was something just shy of heaven and automatically came a la mode w/ no extra charge (huge brownie points).  Again, everything was fresh, homemade and very satisfying to the soul. There are lots of healty options at Pike's as well.  I noticed a lady next to me had ordered a salad topped with blackened salmon.  She too was enjoying a very generous portion of food but in my opinion had no idea what she was missing... or maybe she did and that's why she was eating a salad. Lucky for Charlotte, Pike's is not a chain.  Next time I am in town, I will go back to Pike's for good service, great food, and lots of calories... no salad for me, thank you. I hear their brunch is stellar, no surprise.",

I got a great feeling the moment I walked in the door and could see most of their desserts on display inside a glass counter.  And they sell cupcakes if you're into that fad.    We were seated right away and our waitress was awesome.  She was so sweet and very quick to bring our drinks and subsequent refills.  I ordered the chocolate, peanut butter and banana milkshake recommended by another yelper and it was very tasty.  Most of it was well-blended but it had chunks of banana which I liked.  The hubby got a brownie hot fudge sundae that was amazing.  One friend ordered the gooey pumpkin cake and it was delicious as well.  I'll have to come back sometime and try some food if I can restrain myself from ordering a huge dessert.",

No stomach aches for me, and it was one of the best brownie a la modes I have ever had. And so big! I mean, there's no way the two of us would have been able to finish the one on the menu, but we devoured what we had. I hope to be back soon to experience the delectability again!",

    "text": "Now this is why I use Yelp.  Pike's is an upscale rendition of an everyday soda shop / diner.  With its fancy brick South End building right off of the light rail line, you might mistake this place for some frou frou joint that serves burgers with \"aged artisan cheese\".  You'd be wrong.  For lunch on most days, Pike's deliver an excellent burger and shake meal.  Finish off with a red velvet cupcake or a slice of pie and you'll be in glutton heaven.  That said, the real show here is Sunday brunch.  Wanting to show my visiting parents a good Charlotte breakfast outing, I took a risk in taking them to Pike's.  I'd heard good things on here about the Sunday offerings but never had them in person.  Oh man, did this bet pay off.  Their $9 breakfast buffet has everything from blueberry french toast, eggs benedict, sausage and bacon to hashbrown casserole.  If you get there after 10AM and fork over $14 instead, you can chow down on all of the above PLUS roast beef, sweet potato casserole, green bean casserole and lasagna and more.  Lasagna?  WHAT?  The best part is that all of the food is crazy delicious.  I mean three-plates-full delicious.  The kind of breakfast you walk away from kind of hazy, unsure if your legs are still gonna work.  Sunday here is simply awesome.  Any other time, it's still pretty good.",

The deserts look great but I haven't tried those yet. Maybe on the next visit.",

I recently enjoyed a tasty lunch here and look forward to returning for brunch and to sample the famous ice cream, especially the milkshakes! Service was professional and efficient and the chicken quiche made for a satisfying lunch with the accompanying side salad and muffin. I didn't taste the reuben ordered by my dining companion but it also looked great. I love the ice cream sodas here. Kids will enjoy sitting at the old-fashioned ice cream soda fountain counter and the lovely patio is available for outdoor dining. On Sunday Pike's is open earlier for breakfast and brunch.",

It came with a dude of mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole. The broccoli casserole, I wouldn't even try. It literally had a pool of grease and just looked disgusting. The mashed potatoes were bland, but sadly came in far above the chicken. It just wasn't good at all. Luckily, they were very nice about swapping out my meal, and I got chicken tenders instead. Again, not much flavor, but leaps and bounds above the honey pecan chicken, and I was hungry, so I ate them. To finish, and to boost my opinion of Pike's, we shared a mint chocolate chip shake. I wish I could say it was good, and it was, until I found a hair in it! :( Pike's just isn't the place.",

After receiving a warm welcome when we stepped through the door, we were quickly seated at a comfortable table, and left with our menus.  Our server came immediately, greeted us, and took our drink orders, which she promptly delivered.  We opted for a couple of extra minutes to peruse the menu, as this was our first visit to Pike's.  I ordered the Honey Pecan Chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole and my husband chose the Buffalo Chicken with fries.  Everything arrived quickly and as ordered, and was delicious!  I ordered a old-fashioned chocolate soda, which was a disappointment to this northern girl.  I'm used to ice cream, chocolate syrup and soda water, which was what I thought I would be getting.  Instead, it was chocolate syrup mixed with Coke and served over ice.  Lesson learned.  Overall, our experience was great and we plan to return.

The Sunday brunch includes the usual eggs and grits and sausages and bacon. Then you'll find a sweet potato casserole, meaty lasagna, hand carved roast beef (with horseradish!), broccoli casserole, bread pudding and more. And of course, you can keep eating until you're stuffed.  Wine and beer available (after 12:00 of course) or just go with the coffee or Pepsi products.

    "text": "So I came in the other day to pick up an online order for Postmates. The bartender, Constance, was clearly overwhelmed with a busy Friday afternoon lunch and a new trainee. I waited patiently for my client's food to be ready; I'm fine waiting in a busy restaurant.  Eventually my client's food was ready, and I watched in dismay as Constance ignored it on the expo line minute after minute. My daytime job is at a full-service restaurant; I am very aware of the concept of 'dying food'. As I watched my client's order (chicken fingers and fries) slowly die in the window, I figured I'd ask another employee to hand me the food. After all, it had already been paid for, I just needed to take it to the client. Just hand me the food and I'll be on my way.   Constance noticed when I tried to grab a manager's attention, and said, \"No no no, I've got it, it's just Postmates,\" and shooed away the person who was trying to help me.  I'm sorry... what?   A) I'm sorry (not sorry) Constance, you did not 'have it'. You were clearly weeded and needed help, but your pride got in the way of good customer service.   B) \"... 'just' Postmates\"? Really? REALLY, is a Postmates customer not adding to your revenue? Is the customer I'm representing not worth your time? If you give ME, the Postmates driver fresh and quality food, then your customer gets fresh and quality food. Not lukewarm soggy fries and tender.  All in all, this interaction gave me a very poor impression of this restaurant. I got the impression of a restaurant that has no vision of the big picture or guest experience. Management should have stepped up and helped her, or they can keep guests feeling like an imposition.",

We both saw this restaurant on websites and Yelp so we decided to give it a go.  The display was cool - a little janky because some of the dishes holding the food were broken or hard to get into.. One or two didn't even have covers because they were off to the side ripped off. Wretched, I know! Nonetheless, there weren't many people so the food was abundant.  First round I tried the scrambled eggs, coffee cake, bacon, hash brown casserole, grits and a ham on an English muffin with a poached egg  (forgot what these are called because I normally don't eat it - but as soon as I was typing it.. Something benedict came to mind lol). These were all pretty darn good. I really enjoyed the casserole. It was nice and cheesy. I got some as soon as it came out so it was best fresh.  Second time around, I went and got a few different things.. This time I got some warm apples and a biscuit with gravy. The gravy was pretty bland but the biscuit was fluffy. Catch 22!   I wouldn't come here again because there are so many places to eat in Charlotte but this spot does have that old soda shop feel, so I'd recommend it for the experience.",

If you want breakfast only, you need to arrive before 10am; otherwise, you'll be charged the higher price.   We are usually not fans of buffets, but Pike's has lots of options.  Since they are so busy on Sundays, the food is always super fresh.  My favorites are their biscuits and gravy, cheesy hash brown casserole (absolutely delicious!), extra crispy bacon, and blueberry French toast.  I'm not a fan of eggs Benedict, but theirs looks pretty good, too.  Their butterscotch scones are reminiscent of the now-closed Pewter Rose's scones.  And on the lunch side, their lasagne and roast beef are very good.  Kali (Cali?) is a great server.  On one occasion, another server attempted to provide us with less change when we paid with cash.  Was she trying to hold back more to increase her tip?  I'm not sure, but it was very suspicious, because she immediately responded that she owed us more when we called her out.  Other than that, service has been very good.   I definitely recommend Pike's for Sunday brunch!  Now if we can only get out there for lunch or dinner one day....",

The mint choco-chip malt wasn't that minty (which was great for me) and had HUGE actual chocolate chips in it.  She brought it out and poured it into the old fashioned glass from the large silver shake mixing cup right in front of us.  She left the metal cup on the table as it was still plenty full after filling the malt glass--nearly another malt's worth was in there.

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try this place when I really wanted an old-fashioned diner experience. It's located in a fashionable district, South End, with easy access by car or the light rail. Parking might be a problem if it was busier but we went about 3:30 pm on a Wednesday and found a good spot.   When you walk in, the decor in the front has an old school vibe mixed with some modern touches. We were seated in a quiet corner with a high backed booth that had a mirror after passing several cabinets with antiques.   The menu has a number of choices that are comfort food as well as specials like a Reuben and more. I had the turkey and dressing with mashed potatoes and black eyed peas and my wife had quiche with a side of mac and cheese. Both were very flavorful and delicious; very tasty!  I had the Coke float for dessert and it was so good (even if it was in a Pepsi glass...lol).   I don't know about others' experiences but ours was amazing!",

I got a key lime pie when I first stopped in.  The food is fine nothing I would remember but I am being told by the local it is standard good old fashion southern comfort food. That I give it 3 stars. I could be wrong and I will go back to try something else.  All in all I would go back, the people are nice the food is decent and I like places I can walk to easily.  This place is very dog friendly. They bring you dog a real water bowl.",

The fries were nothing special but pretty good dipped in ranch. We sipped dessert after such an indulgent lunch but the ice cream and sundae options sounded delicious, the peach milkshake special of the day sounded wonderful. Overall, we had great service and a good lunch in a fun environment. We look forward to going back.",

I must say that I truly wanted to like this place, but after 3 different visits I've come the realization that it will never happen. I do not claim to be a chef or an expert on food, but I know poor quality food when I taste it. Not only is the food overpriced, but about half of what I've tried here tasted as if it were microwaved. The only thing worth going to Pike's for is the root beer floats, but if you're hungry I suggest eating somewhere up the street instead of wasting your hard earned money here.  Giving 2 starts instead of 1 because of it's pleasant atmosphere.",

The interior was nice and homey, and the patio looked perfect was slightly less warm weathers.  I looked at the menu and got excited to see quiche there. So I ordered that. My boyfriend had the pimento burger. One of our friends had the Mexican omelet and another did the brunch buffet.  The quiche was okay. It wasn't bad, but I've had better quiche on multiple occasions. My boyfriend's burger was delicious. So much, that the piece that I tried, I saved a part of it to eat after I finished my quiche. The Mexican omelet looked good, but the brunch buffet seemed a little steep at $14 for the kind of stuff our friend had on her plate.  No milk options for your coffee, only whole milk or half-n-half... bummer.",

Upon arrival the 3 hosts informed us without a smile, eye contact, or any grace at all that the wait would be 15 minutes.  Another family arrived right after us and asked to be seated on the patio which was empty. While we waited beyond 30 minutes, 20 more people arrived all if whom were asked also to wait.  When it began to sprinkle outside I decided to look inside the restaurant. I was dismayed to see 6 open and cleared tables awaiting paying customers.  The wait staff were not working with any urgency at all and the 3 hostesses were certainly not at all interested in service.  My family and I left shortly after another family.   Strictly from a business perspective why would Pike's pay 3 hosts to treat customers so poorly?  Alienating customers can easily be achieved by paying 1 host.  When I called and asked to speak to management I was told they were too busy to speak to me.  Pike's food does not warrant enduring such treatment. Pike's is not distinctively better than other choices in Charlotte. There is no reason to return and my family and I will not.",

    "text": "We had Sunday brunch buffet at Pikes a few weeks ago, I suggest you go before 11:30. They do accept reservations for parties of six or more. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting. We arrived shortly before 11:30 therefore we had no wait, upon leaving the line to be seated was out the door and extremely congested. I suppose you give your name to be placed on a list to be seated, that said it seemed most people waiting lingered around the door area. This made it a tad difficult getting through the buffet line as well as trying to get through the door to leave. I think there's very limited waiting space at the door although there were chairs for those waiting to be seated just outside the front door for those waiting to be seated. We were very pleased with our brunch especially considering it was a buffet we weren't sure what to expect. There were several different pastry type items to choose from, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, bacon, sausage, hash brown casserole (which was wonderful), a blueberry French toast that was wonderful as well. They also offered steam boat roast beef sliced for you as well as several other \"non breakfast\" type foods that appeared to look as good as the breakfast stuff. We were to full from our breakfast choices to give those a try. I'm certain there will be more trips to Pikes from us in the future. I should add although they are clearly busy for Sunday brunch our server was very helpful (this was our first visit) as well as attentive in refilling drinks and clearing our table of dirty dishes. Give them a try you won't be disappointed!!",

Once seated our waiter was very attentive and immediately came over to greet herself and take our drink orders. My children ordered from the kids menu and I ordered meatloaf and string beans.

    "text": "The day South End loses this place to the non-stop hipster construction and rebranding, we will have all lost something. I've ate here 4 times, each time was a day that started off with a craving for home cooked food. The least eventful memory was the quiche I ordered to go. Anyway, here and Midnight Dinner are where I've ended up on my diet-crashing days. Yesterday I took advantage of a GroupOn that has been sitting around. A mushroom Swiss burger with fries and a last minute call on a brownie sundae. I asked for the burger medium and it was just over into medium well but nonetheless, still juicy. Fries are pretty typical and came out hot with the perfect crispness. The sundae was insane and would be the perfect \"date dessert\" where you sit on the same side of the booth and feel utterly sinful together but oh no, yesterday it was all mine. And it may seem minor but I'm from Pittsburgh so having Heinz ketchup on the table instead of the Southern-preferred French's also helps compliment my Pennsylvania palette. Thank you Pike's for consistency, quality and always friendly wait staff.",

    "text": "Love the location of this restaurant.  It is in the trendy south end and right next to the light rail.   The counter and the stools and decadent desserts behind the glass display transport you to a by gone era.  I had a salad with  scoops of egg salad, tuna salad, and chicken salad.  It was a hearty portion and the side of fries that I ordered made the lunch a bit too filling.   It's not the first time I have been too full!   This would be a great place to come for dessert and a beverage at the counter.   It's definitely a casual place that is probably better than the local diners. A lot of food sandwich and salad selections.  Apparently the fried pickles are pretty popular here. Fun atmosphere. I would have given more stars had the service been better.  Our server never checked to see if everything was alright and I almost had to stand on my head to get a refill on the iced tea!    Anyway, I hope this place stays here forever. It deserves to have patronage!",

From the moment we entered to the moment we left, the staff bent over backwards   The Brunch is divided with breakfast on the left and lunch on the right.    The breakfast is fantastic.   I am 100% a bacon and sausage snob, but this was some good meat.  Great bacon makes any meal spectacular.   The biscuits are fresh and the home made gravy, is a southern delight.  They had real scrambled eggs, cheesy hashbrowns, eggs benedict - all great.  I noticed they had thick French Toast, but did not partake.  The lunch side started with a cup of Tomato Bisque, add ground up bacon and it was a home run.   I just want to go on record, that this was one of the best prime rib steak meals I have ever had.  I walked by and thought, damn that looks good, but then I observed the carver placing \"choice\" cuts in the au-juice.  He served up some cuts that had been in for a while, because I cannot remember tasting such flavorful and tender meat.  Combined with their homemade horsey sauce is awesome....     They had some other lunch plates like lazonia, but I did not try.  I am looking forward to my next Sunday Brunch!",

Chicken and Wild Rice Soup with a Grilled Cheese with Bacon.  The soup was so fresh and although it is cream base, not too heavy. As for the grilled cheese, cooked too perfection, with cheese melted perfectly. This past Sunday we stopped in for brunch. We arrived around 10 so sme items were still being brought out, but what a variety, fruit, scones, grits, eggs, bacon and sausage, eggs benedict, tomato basil soup and even a hot station with meats.  Items were kept filled and the service was top notch.  Come hungry and enjoy!",

Food was ready quick, pick up was easy. Food was still hot when we brought it home. The broccoli casserole was soooo good! The chicken was crunchy. The sauce that came with the chicken was a little too sweet for me, I'd prefer it had a kick at the end. The shrimp and grits were generous in sauce and shrimp. The grits themselves were very creamy but, need to be seasoned a little more. The malt shake was good but, the one from Which Which is even better. Everything was delicious really. We would come back for more! Cheers!",

The food didn't seem terribly fresh, the fruit was soggy and old and the quiche tasted like someone heated it up in a microwave. The middle was icy cold while the outside was burnt.The tea and lemonade was painfully sweet, seems whoever made up the recipe is a near diabetic. The side salad I was served had wilted lettuce and some sad looking tomatoes which had decidedly seen better days. Don't get me wrong this place is a step above fast food but I'd appreciate if someone would act like they cared about the state of the food. Especially when my bill was $35.   So I'm sitting trying to enjoy this mediocre food and I hear yelling from the kitchen. We were situated so we could see in the swinging door where the employees came in and out. I hear this man screaming at people quite loudly. I assume it was the owner because he wasn't in uniform. Very unprofessional. Should spend less time yelling and more time updating the place, it's a mess.  This was my first stay here and I will definitely not be coming back again.",

In addition, she had to scrape the sides of the dish to get it.  It's conveniently located next to LYNX and makes a great stop to and from Uptown for a game or something.

    "text": "Pike's is really fun as it offers old fashioned foods, milkshakes and a to-die for brunch on the weekends. Their meatloaf is just as good as your mama's and their milkshake selection is enormous! All of their milkshakes are made by hand by a \"soda jerk\" and are super yummy. I highly suggest stopping in for their brunch buffet. It offers many different breakfast foods as well as a meat carving station. And the buffet is pretty affordable too, somewhere around $15 or so. Whenever I dine here, the place is always busy but the wait for a table is never too long as they also have an outdoor patio section that is nice to enjoy on a warmer day.   I say start with the brunch first.. then go from there. You will be back! :)",

The fish tacos were not very blackened and a small portion.  The flour tortilla was not warm and was eventually soggy.  My friend had the meatloaf sandwich and she said it was very good.  We passed on dessert which is sad since their chocolate cake is to die for.  I will go back but not for the fish tacos.",

They have old fashioned food like meat loaf and turkey dinner to quiche and Sandwiches.  I have never had an I cream soda there but they look just like the ones I had as a child at an old time drug store counter. The BBQ sandwich was the special the last two times I was there and I got it both times.  Excellent BBQ. My husband had the meatloaf both times and really liked it.  My sister got chicken quiche and she said it was the best quiche she ever had.  I love the fact that they have the very fine crushed ice and great ice tea. I heard from a friend that they have great Sunday Brunch.  Looking forward to trying soon.  Good service.",

You'll find tons of families and little kids there.  In the summertime, it's fun to sit outside and watch the light rail go by and enjoy a milkshake.",

    "text": "Solid 3.5- I've gone several times and overall have enjoyed it.  I've had the breakfast buffet in the past- and it's pretty darn good...but not good enough for me to think to recommend it unless someone is thinking of specifically staying in south-end.   Today for lunch I went with the pecan chicken. I too (like another reviewer) found it to be a bit overwhelming after awhile and would have liked something lighter on the side or for lunch (but that's my own fault). The mashed potatoes were luke-warm and the casserole was good but  very heavy. The chicken itself was very sweet - and the honey sauce can be a bit much after the first bite or two.   I really want to try the limeade/orangeade but at $3 a pop - I may as well wait till after I get off of work and get an alcoholic version for a dollar more. I think if they lowered that price a bit I would definitely go for it.   ...I do feel price-wise the chicken was a great deal at $8.95 - but the sandwiches were on the same price point as the entree- seemed odd?   Service was pretty good- we had a large group and he did a nice job about getting our meals out to us and handled the  separate check situation like an expert!   I still havent found a go-to entree but I will keep looking",

    "text": "Looovin' yoooou, is easy because you remind me of home with your tasty food selection, doot'n doot'n do doooo....  It's True, though. Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop reminds me of the many, many diners that dotted my home town in Maine. I've grown accustomed to Southern food since I've been here, but I love me some yank options.   FOOD: Mmmmmchickeckmushroomonionquiche. Buttery, savory, chicken-ey... delicious, and a very generous slice at that. Accompanied by a muffin and a garden salad, this really hit my comfort spot. The person I went with had the pecan-encrusted chicken, which I eyed jealously due to the amazing aromas that were wafting over to my side of the table. I'm determined to try that next when I go back. We split a piece of tollhouse pie with vanilla icecream, and here was my only disappointment. The icecream was great, but the pie was overcooked and crunchy/stale where it should have been chewy-gooey.   SERVICE: I like'em spunky, and that's what we got. Casual conversation and laughter was abound, with our food also brought out in a timely manner. Booyah.   ATMOSPHERE: Homey diner, with the high-backed wooden booth benches, and the stools at the soda bar. Like someone took a soda shop from the 40's and mashed it together with hipster culture. I know how that may sound, but trust me when I say it was a success.  PRICE: Average, but the food is above average for the price, in my opinion.  Overall: Pikes has been branded my homesick hub. Whenever I dream of Maine, I'll come here, pull up onnah stool, and get meh a hot turkey sammich, yessah.",

When u pay $14 for a buffet, I would think it would be continually stocked, but they couldn't keep up with the demand. If I went on Sunday in the future, I would go before 10:00 so I could get the cheaper price. My wife ordered off the menu and I think I would do the same next time if I didn't do the buffet.  One of the biggest pluses...if you like potatoe casserole, this I'd the place for you...awesome cheese covered potatoes...Yum! All in all... So-So",

    "text": "Finally decided to pay a visit here after taking the kids to Freedom Park - I've seen Pike's from the light rail and always wondered what it was like.   Decor-wise it's a funky mix of old fashioned soda shop (complete with wooden floorboards) mixed with gentrified warehouse chic (complete with exposed girders). The outdoor patio looks really inviting and mellow, especially considering the location (busy corner in the South End).   The menu has a plethora of diner/soda shop standards, notably burgers, sandwiches, and comfort food like fried chicken and meatloaf. The kids ordered the hot dog and grilled cheese kids meals, along with the upgraded milk shakes (of course!). Based on the advice from our server I ordered the Carolina Classic burger - you guessed it, 1/2 pd patty with chili, coleslaw, mustard and onions. Asked for their house chips on the side.   Some observations:  1. The kids meals are impressive in both their size and quality - the hot dog was a kosher beef one, grilled perfectly. Came with two sides, fresh fruit and the house made chips. The grilled cheese was also high quality and overflowing with gooey monterey jack. For the extra $1, the small milkshakes are a steal!  2. The house made potato chips rock -perfectly fried and salted. Completely addictive. They should really create some sort of nacho dish with these. . .if you ladle their house made chili and sprinkle some cheddar on top you would have a heavenly appetizer.  3. While the burger was very good (cooked on a griddle, which I prefer) the chili was stupendous! Meaty, complex, thick - perfect for a burger and made me want to scoop up the leftovers with the chips!   Service-wise, no complaints - prompt, friendly and honest.   Overall this was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone in the Dilworth/South End/Uptown area. Great option if you are at Freedom Park or Nascar Hall of Fame and want a comfortable place for you and the family.",

We were so insanely late to the meeting we missed the entire thing.   Worst service I've ever had in Charlotte, not to mention the fact we specifically told the waitress we were in a hurry, and she said it wouldn't be any inconvenience.

My favorites are the vegetable plate for lunch (don't miss out on the delicious casseroles) or the blueberry french toast at brunch (and all of the yummy desserts).",

    "text": "After an unsuccessful Yelper excursion attempt to Pike's for late night desserts, I decided to stop by for lunch today instead.   The atmosphere is interesting. It's casual and quaint, but set in a somewhat industrial styled brick building. Picture old wooden booths with coat hooks and large gilded mirrors set against a ceiling of exposed air ducts and dropped track lighting.   We were greeted warmly at the door, guided to our table quickly and our orders were taken promptly.   Their menu selection features traditional American favorites, some with Southern twists. Choose your own fixin's style burgers, meatloaf sandwiches, chicken tenders are just some of the selections. Their \"made from scratch\" soups caught my eye, but today's selection was potato bacon and sounded a little too heavy for my tastes.   Our food was delivered within a reasonable time frame. My cheeseburger was good, somewhere between the mark of Five Guys and Penguin's. Fries were crisp, without the taste of old frying oil (my pet peeve). My husband's turkey burger was pretty tasty, seasoned with plenty of flavored seasoning salt.   We finished lunch with the Tollhouse Pie, a chocolate chip cookie baked in a pie crust, topped with vanilla ice cream and fudge. It tasted just as I hoped. Warm, chocolaty, rich, but balanced by the ice cream - an American classic.   My one criticism would be the restrooms which are in dire need of remodeling. I shudder if the old adage of judging a restaurant by their bathroom is really True. At any rate, the dining room atmosphere, food and dessert were all enjoyable.",

The wait staff was super friendly and as you might guess it looks much like an old timey soda shop inside.   My cousin ordered a thin mint milkshake at the beginning of the meal and asked if we could have three straws so my other cousin and I could take a sip. Instead, the waiter brought three cups which was really sweet. I took a tiny little sip - it was delicious.   For dinner I ordered the strawberry salmon salad. It was great. Candied pecans, apples, strawberries, all on a bed of spinach with a very well cooked salmon and strawberry lime vinaigrette on the side.   I thought it was really tasty!   I'll definitely be back!",

Now, if a crowded restaurant is any indication of how good a restaurant is, then the crowd at Pike's will tell you that. I had the honey pecan fried chicken and it came with broccoli and seasoned mashed potatoes. It was awesome and tasty. The hint of honey with the pecans was perfect, I ate it all and will be back for more. Parking will be a challenge at lunchtime, so get there before noon, and that should help you to get seated fairly quickly. The prices for lunch are a bit high, but well worth it. Tip your server well, because they work hard at lunchtime.",

She ordered the honey chicken - a boneless fried breast, coated with honey - very tender, with mashed potatoes and green beans. She loved it. I ordered the turkey burger without bun which in many restaurants come out OK. I wasn't so impressed with Pike's. The turkey patty was small and over-seasoned. I'll give it a 2-star. Unfortunately the fries on the side were a 1 - limp and fairly greasy. Yes, I know if you read any of my other reviews, you'll know I'm a fry-snob. These just didn't fill the bill.   My bottom line is, because of the friendly people, I will go back and try some other menu items.",

Only giving three stars because even tho the food was good, the service was just meh.  1. My husband ordered American classic burger with fries. Really good and meat was really tasty.   2. After debating whether to go with pot roast or honey pecan friend chicken, I ordered the latter. My mind was blown away. This was cooked to perfection. I shared it with my 3 year old and he just kept eating it. The broccoli casserole was really good ,too.   3. We weren't asked if we wanted anything to drink and were brought water, which was fine. Half way through our meal, my husband asked if he can have root beer, server totally forgot about it. Oh well.   4. Banana split dessert was good. Nothing fancy just your average banana split. But my cravings were satisfied.   5. Service was meh. This was our first time here and even tho the food was good I don't think we will be back for a while. I feel like we we're rushed from eating.  I was finishing the dessert with my kid and server took the plate away. Even grabbed the check tray as soon as my husband signed it. Idk if he was trying to get off his shift  but whatever. It made our dining experience lack lustre.",

I'm literally addicted to the honey pecan chicken, broccoli casserole and sweet potato casserole. It's always so delish, fresh and hot. Have never had a bad experience with it. Only reason why I deducted one star is because my nephew was with me and he ordered the shrimp and grits. Although delish and he really enjoyed it, he was not pleased at the amount of grits to sauce ratio. The bowl wasn't very deep so for the price it just seemed to not be enough for what they were charging. Most places I have had shrimp and grits from came in a deep bowl so you could get your money's worth. Other than that a great experience with delish food and a friendly staff.",

    "text": "Perhaps this isn't my first time on this Earth? This was my first visit to Pike's and I loved it. It's not that the food was the best thing that ever happened to me. It's that the food was a solid 8/10. My waiter was an 11/10. The music was a 10/10. The weather the day I visited was a 10/10 (72 in January). Everyone who walked by and worked there smiled and spoke. My overall experience was wonderful.   My waiter, and I forget his name. He was a very handsome, well built, young thang. He had a great sense of humor. Actually joked with us the whole time and was funny. Not corny, not annoying, legitimate not trying too hard made me laugh funny. You can tell he has a good personality 24/7 and I'm not saying that because he was cute. He even told me I was the slowest eater he ever saw. It's True. Management also walked by and asked if everything was okay. He was genuinely friendly. I loved everyone here.  My friend and I ordered the honey pecan fried chicken, which came with broccoli casserole and mashed potatoes. I subbed my mashed potatoes for sweet potato casserole at no additional cost (Yay!). We also shared spinach dip. The dip was creamy with lots of spinach. We ate every single bite of it. The chips were fresh. Not sure if they cook them in house, but they at least warm them up. Also noteworthy is the price point here is really good. $11/ meal.  The chicken was divine. I was a bit nauseous that day, and still couldn't stop eating. The chicken was cooked perfectly and a bit juicy without being drown in honey. The pecans were not cooked,which I think would've enhanced the flavor. I'm definitely going back and getting the exact same meal. Pike's is going to become one of my regular spots to visit.",

It was a Sunday and beautiful out, so it was perfect place to grab some brunch and enjoy the weather.  The service was great, our waiter was super attentive, and we got seated right away.  The brunch buffet looked great, but was definitely a little pricey as others have mentioned.  I wasn't super hungry, so I opted for the quiche (which was good but not amazing).  My husband got the buffet and I kind of felt like there wasn't a lot of stand out options that would merit the $13 price.  Overall I really liked the feel of it and had a good experience, just wish the price wasn't so high or there were more reasonable options.",

He said he could not make food recommendations as he  had only been on the job three weeks.  We appreciated his honesty. The flounder was on special , so we gave it a try.  The fish was okay, but  nothing spectacular.  My fries had way too much black pepper on them.  Why only three stars?  The hostess, the first face you see, was sulllen, her greeting was non existent.  She is a definite downer to the Pike's experience",

My friend  and I had a Greek salad with salmon and it was on a bed of iceberg lettuce and the salmon was very dry. It was not good at all. My other friend ordered the quiche, which came with a brand muffin and a salad. Well she finally got the salad after she was finished eating and I reminded the waitress that she never got it. Another friend asked for a water and finally got it right before we got ready to leave and we had asked for it over and over. Our waitress seemed very flustered. We had to keep asking for the condiments and the dressing that came with our salads. She was so bad one of the girls sked the manager if she was new. It was a horrible way to start my day. Needless to say we will not be going back. The only good thing was the oreo milkshake one of the girls got, she said it was delicious!",

I arrived just after 10:00 and had no problem finding a parking spot as things were pretty quiet.  I was seated quickly and greeted just as quickly by my waiter, Justin.  I chose the buffet which had the advantage of staring me down as soon as I walked in the front door.  The breakfast side of the buffet runs the entire front portion of the front counter, with the lunch side along the wall on the right.  The food was good, with the only strike being the hash browns, which were more like a hashbrown casserole (a la Cracker Barrel).  The service was fantastic.  Justin was on top of things throughout the meal.  Plates were removed quickly and my water was refilled in a very timely manner.  The price jumps $5.00 after 10:00am and I'm not certain if it's worth it.  The breakfast portion is definitely worth it, and next time I'll make it a point to stop by earlier.",

I was served the bisque first and I enjoyed the thick consistency of the soup. The reuben came out hot and tasted good. While I enjoyed the thin amount of dressing, I would have liked a bit more beef. The fruit was decent, too. For dessert, I ordered the gooey pumpkin bread served warm with whipped cream. Delicious!

The chips were soggy, and other foods were obviously previously frozen. We could have easily cooked our food better at home, and not have to deal with the slow and unorganized service.  We asked for particular side items and got different ones that we didn't ask for. The waiters were running around frantically, like they obviously needed more help, and it was obvious to us, because they would constantly bring orders out to the wrong tables.  Sorry to say we don't have anything really positive about the restaurant to say, except that the staff was at least nice and it's in a prime location. Definitely would not go again.",

One of the best comfort food I had in Charlotte was here at Pike's.   As I was looking at the menu, it was clear why people flock to Pike's.  Simply, because of their classic Southern American dishes that cannot be found anywhere else in Charlotte: create your own burger, giant milkshakes, and house-made desserts & sodas, just to name a few.  I loved the fantastic old-school decor with the spinning barstools, and stainless steel furniture. Also, it's pet-friendly which is a plus.  Four and Half Yelps.",

The staff was friendly. I did see bugs crawling around but I kind of chalked it up to just the door being opened & closed. It put me off slightly but I tried to over look it. The menu is a decent size & they do have a lot of things to choose from. I got the Carolina cheeseburger I think it was called. It was just a plain cheeseburger. Nothing special but it was very very good. I will say that. I got the Mac & cheese as my side & well.... that wasn't so good. I didn't like the macaroni at all. It had a very weird taste & consistency. Our waitress was nice but you could tell she'd just started & didn't know too much about the menu. Overall, the place was just ok. I don't think it's somewhere I would frequent though.",

    "text": "When I travel to a city that I have never visited before, I look at Groupon. It's a perfect way to save a bit of money, visit restaurants, figure out where they are, and see how yummy the food is. I bought two Groupons. The first one was with Pike's.  The restaurant's description had me at ice cream. Being borderline lactose-intolerant does not stop me from having it.  The funny thing about both restaurants with Groupon promotions is that I had a difficult time opening the main door at both places. Perhaps I was so weak without any food in my stomach that I didn't have the strength. A male staff member helped me out at Pike's.  I came here for lunch. I got seated in a booth. It wasn't all that busy. It did feel like I was in a time warp. I loved the retro feel.  My server was wonderful. I indicated that I had a Groupon. He encouraged me to order as much as I could to maximize my $20 Groupon. I went with the following items:  - French beef dip au jus - Fries with turkey gravy - Diet Pepsi - Bread pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream  I asked whether I could get gravy with my fries. He asked me whether I wanted beef or turkey gravy. So fancy! Options are wonderful. I went with the latter.  I like that the food portions aren't ridiculously massive. My French beef dip au jus was the perfect size. The beef was tender. The baguette was crusty and tender. The jus wasn't overly salty. It was perfect.  I loved the turkey gravy on the fries. I ate everything on that plate. With the turkey gravy being this delicious, I have a feeling that the beef gravy would have been equally as tasty.  My server was attentive and got me a second Diet Pepsi without my even asking for another. I didn't finish all of it, but I was pretty close.  The bread pudding here is amazing! He asked whether I wanted my scoop of vanilla ice cream to be on top of the bread pudding or on the side. I love how accommodating staff are. I went with the former. The ice cream was creamy and yummy.  In the end, I did well on the how-much-can-you-get-for-twenty-bucks scale. I owed 53 cents! Naturally, I plopped down a decent tip.   I loved it here. I had a relaxing, delicious lunch and visited a different part of Charlotte.  Metered parking is on the street. There was plenty of it when I dropped by after 13:00. The meter accepts credit cards.

I will say that the malts we got were very good! Black cherry was just the right consistency and no big chunks of cherries was a plus. The food comes out pretty fast (we actually got our food a few minutes after our appetizers). The server was very kind and spent extra time talking to our group and appeared attentive to our table. Overall, okay experience, nothing spectacular, but I do have plans to give it another shot!",

All it was missing was the white gravy.  Fries were previously frozen and awful.  The Mac and cheese is boxed, the onion rings were also previously frozen.  And the price for what you get is ridicules.  For the price they charge I expect real made from scratch meals not reheats from us foods.",

Since I'm on vacation, I get what sounds interesting, and this time I drew from the bottom of the menu and pulled out an Chocolate New York Egg Cream. No, I didn't know what it was, but for those curious, it's 1/2 Yoo Hoo! (only much better tasting) and 1/2 whipped egg whites. Or something that approximates whipped egg whites. It fills the \"I want ice cream but not something as heavy as a malt\" gap so well that it really ought to be offered in more places.  With it I got Honey Pecan Fried Chicken, with a side of potatoes and broccoli casserole, in a misguided attempt to eat healthier. As it turns out the broccoli casserole has a lot of onions, but even more dairy, and lots of cheese. Delicious, but oops! The potatoes were very well seasoned. The fried chicken is something they're very good at; perfectly crisp at the margins, flattened to a uniform ~1/4\" thickness, and holding a pool of honey and toasted pecans in the middle. This was great stuff.  They probably could use another server or two, but on the whole I'd recommend Pike's in a heartbeat.",

We ordered Chicken and waffles (they were fried chicken tenders), and a baked chicken breast sandwich (with pineapple and bacon) with fries on the side. I had the sandwich and it was good. I liked that it came out steaming hot because I like my food served hot. My husband had the chicken and waffles and he liked it. So, four stars for the food. My only issue was that I thought the restaurant could be a bit cleaner. A table directly next to us sat dirty and while we were eating a little critter visited us on the side of the wall. It wasn't a roach, but since I was feeling like the dining room could do with a bit more thorough cleaning (the floors were a little dirty too), it made me cringe. I had to deduct a star for overall cleanliness. Oh...and they're a bit too pricey. I would only return if there was another Groupon deal and if they did a better job cleaning up the dining area.",

Big mistake on our part...(for waiting so long to try it).  We were entertaining out of town family and wanted to give them a taste of Charlotte. Ironically we were at the \"taste of Charlotte\" event earlier in the day. But I digress.   We walk into Pikes for dinner and it really does have that old school soda shop/diner vibe. The menu has some great home style dishes and typical southern appetizers, along with plenty of options for milkshakes, malts and floats.  I had the pecan fried chicken. It was atop the entrees listed on the menu. I love pecans. I love fried chicken. It was a great combination. It was delicious and a good sized portion. It came with mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole. I subbed in fries.   I also had a fresh orangeade and for dessert a root beer flavored milkshake. I was very impressed and can't wait to go back. The service was good and the prices were very reasonable. They also have daily specials and brunch on Sundays, both of which were very intriguing.   It's a fun and casual place and very reasonably priced. I look forward to my next visit and definitely recommend for folks to give it a try.",

    "text": "I would give the Charlotte location more stars but I'm a customer big on customer  service and I don't like bad service. I work in the area so we ordered often. I especially like the turkey burger because of the size but it was really small today. I told the cashier I wasn't happy and she had an attitude and she called the manager like....\"dude come tell this chick it's the same ounces every burger\" and the manager agreed with her but offered to make me another. so I had to sit there while she's venting to another  manager in front of me on what happened and her body language, the neck rolling, and the new manager looking at me made feel like she had a problem with me not being satisfied so I asked the manager if she is ok and is it a problem that I'm not happy and she said no but I said it seems like it and she said no she's just going through alot. my new burger came out and they're all standing around to see my reaction to the same  small burger. I told them thanks and left. I threw it away. well there goes almost 13 dollars. my clients or the stylists that came every week will not be going here anymore.  if you complain, it doesn't matter that your the customer because if the cashier is having a bad day......thats more important than customer service......terrible. signed a once happy customer but so upset with the professionalism and how customers don't matter",

    "text": "Equal parts old-fashioned soda shop, restaurant, bar, and hangout. The location is absolutely crucial here. Located in one of the more walkable parts of South End, Pike's is a gem with a hefty menu complete with plenty of sweets and southern treats.  Haven't been to Pike's in quite some time and this was my first go for lunch. Decided to dine al fresco and enjoyed every second of it. This time 'round, didn't go for anything on the sweet side of things, but rather went for the lunch menu solely.   Started with the mozzarella sticks. Both myself and my dining counterpart were shocked that they weren't the \"out of the bag\" variety. These appeared to be hand breaded with a higher quality cheese than typically served. Marinara was standard, but the mozz sticks themselves were great. They also weren't covered with the typical panko, moon dust, crappy breading like usual.  Went with the buffalo chicken sandwich for my entree. Holy craaaaaap. Ditch the bun, eat a few of the house-made chips, and enjoy the chicken. Not only is this sucker lightly breaded and flavored well with the buffalo sauce, it's straight up baptized in the sauce. Swimming, rather. I'm usually not for a pool of sauce, but this stuff was fantastic. It acted as a nice residual dipping sauce for the remaining chips.   Service was friendly, outside was perfect for the present weather, prices are fair, walkability is always a plus. Find a parking space along Camden or near Atherton and you're good to go.",

I love vintage things and I love ice cream, so it seemed like a logical thing to come check this place out!  This place gets more kudos for it's fun, light, family oriented atmosphere and its vintage look.  I love how it feels like you stepped into a different time when you walk in.  The servers were really friendly and cheerful and everyone around seemed to be having a good time.  The food, unfortunately, is just OK.  Nothing special - your typical diner like food and even their milkshakes were tasty, but not anything I haven't already had before.  I did enjoy myself there, however, so would come back again if I were in the neighborhood, but unfortunately, won't likely be one of my regular spots for grub.",

I asked my server about it and this was his story....this is how they make them. If you want it thick you need to request it. I'll just go to Chick-fil-A or Dairy Queen instead!

    "text": "I actually went here twice this past weekend while my parents were in town. We first popped in for dinner and then again for the breakfast buffet. It's worth mentioning that there is actually a breakfast and a brunch buffet with varied times, a bit of a varied menu and a few dollars more for brunch.  In order of how much I appreciated each, I would say the wait-staff deserves the gold, the atmosphere and decor the silver and the food gets the bronze. Now, the same way I wouldn't complain about a bronze medal I really can't complain about the food. However, I truly can't rave about it. So much so that I needed to knock two stars off.  What Pike's has effectively proven to be for me is a close-by place to grab a good meal at a good price without much hassle. Nothing stands out and I'm never craving it but a good stand-by none-the-less.  Disclaimer: This can very well be grounds for an updated review in the coming weeks but the most I've experienced in way of desserts here is a SIP of a milkshake. The cakes on display look great and a slice of one with a milkshake on the side could nudge me to add a 4th star.",

If he had eaten the bread we could have had a life threatening situation since he is severe allergic.

When we moved up here in 2002, I discovered Pike's a few months after getting here and  was hooked  by the Soda Shop sign- my mom grew up in the days when they were the norm.  I appreciate the consistency of the care given by the owner and the staff to their customers and I don't  think I have ever had a bad meal there.  We drive in from University City about twice a month and I know the daily specials by heart- Fish Friday is good ( very nice roumalade sauce!) and the pork tenderloin on Thursday is very nice as is the Mac and Cheese.  If you have good sweet tea, which they do, you are already half way to my heart.  On the special inserts, the owner has a message to take on the bottom of the page and I can honestly say the management abides by it. It goes something like \"Recycle even when it is inconvenient, tip lavishly, do something nice for a stranger...\"etc.  I appreciate people who honestly seem to give a care about  your repeat business and now, almost 8 years from the first visit, we still keep going back. Sunday brunch buffet can get very crowded very fast depending on when you venture out, and that was the one thing that I haven't been that impressed with though there are plenty of options. Bottom line, if you like a laid back atmosphere, aren't necessarily in a rush ( though they do try to be prompt) and remember that you are, after all, still in a southern city when it comes to the menu then it should be a nice experience.  Peanut Butter milkshake is usually divine, too, but a smidgen pricey so get it to drink there ( you get more)!!",

I only liked one or two dishes from the entire brunch buffet. But it has also a great outdoor seating area and inside it is nice and rustic and reminds me a bit of nice brunch places in Berlin, Germany. I will return but hope that the quality of food will increase a bit. The reason I still gave it four out of five stars is that the price might be so low as they are reflecting the quality of the food.

If I read the menu correctly, you have to get there before 10am to get the breakfast price of $8.95 versus the \"brunch\" price of $13.95.  The buffet was perfect and offered everything I could have wanted so I suggest sticking with the breakfast buffet.  Buffets can go one way or the other.  Either they are disgusting (ie Golden Corrall) with a ton of plastic, boxed food or they are a display of heavenly goodness.  Fortunately for me, Pike's offered the latter!   We're talking fresh fruit salad, biscuits and gravy, grits, cheese/potatoe hash, muffins, scones and pastries, eggs, egg benedict, sausage, bacon, blueberry french toast, etc.  Everything was fresh, what needed to be crispy was crispy, what needed to be fluffy was fluffy, what needed to be moist was moist.  It was all very good and of course the best part is that it is limitless!  The servers were friendly and by around 10:30 it was starting to get packed.  Obviously the south-end location is key and there really shouldn't be any other reason not to give them a try!  I'll be back!",

We ordered the grilled cheese sandwich which was excellent and came with and order of tasty, hot, crunchy fries. The bread was thick and perfectly grilled and went really well with the three cheeses. Also, we ordered the blackened fish taco which contained flounder and a variety of spices. Really good. Topped with a three scoop vanilla and chocolate sundae. Good service found street parking around the corner. Check it out!!",

My blueberry Cobbler was pretty good. The place was disguisting. They claim it's \"old fashion\" atmosphere. But no, it's just an excuse not to update anything. Its gross, old, and ruined furniture.",

So, I have lived here for nine years and never step foot into Pike's.   Today I decided to drop in, it was close to three, it is very cute, like an old fashion soda shop (that is a little revamped), a huge drug store clock where it's always ten till eight and cute little memorabilia around.   You may be asking, well Tonya, why the five stars? Let's start.  First of all my french fry barometer scored it a 'yahoooooo' for my scorched fingertips from the hot fries. I ordered a hot dog with raw onion, jalapeno and yellow mustard. My hot dog was made with love, the condiments went to both ends of the dog, not just in the middle and what really made me happy, the simple act of sprinkling salt and pepper on my fries before serving. I can tell, whoever was in the kitchen, prepared my lunch with love.   I also saw a Coca-Cola float go out with Mexican bottled Coke. Can I get a hell yeah? Sorry I was so harsh and judgmental.",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant for a quick bite the day we moved to Charlotte, and we really liked it.  We enjoyed the food, and service was awesome.  Later it was the first patio we took our puppy to when we got him,  (perk- they are dog friendly).  The staff was really sweet and brought out a dog bowl of water for him,  and we were excited to find a place that we could take him.  But our most recent experience there has soured me from ever wanting to return.  My husband and I ordered take out lunch, and it was inedible. The salads were overdressed to the point that the lettuce was wilted and soggy, and my tuna steak which was supposed to be medium rare was well done and burned.  We ended up throwing our lunch away it was so bad.  I could forgive one bad food experience, especially since we have great memories at this restaurant (heck, everyone has an off day), but it was the customer experience after that has been a nightmare.  When we called to speak with a manager, we were given the option of a refund or a gift card.  We requested a refund, and were promised it would be done within a day or two (this was the day we ordered food).  After multiple calls (over a month and a half), and conversations with managers, (Nick and Chris), still no refund. Each conversation they were as sweet and apologetic as could be, promising immediate action, but then, no follow through.  They took our full card info down multiple times, each time claiming they didn't have it.  Last we spoke with a manager, they were going into the office to take care of it and would \"call right back\".  Surprise, surprise, no call back.  And when I called later that day to follow up with the manager, who was supposed to call me back, I was told he was \"in a meeting\".    The food is inconsistent, (but good when they are on), but the place is run poorly.  I may be sweet but I am not stupid.  If you aren't going to refund me for a poor product, then don't lie to me and say you are.  It's just rude.",

Now, I will say the service wasn't the best, however, their food made up for it tenfold.  I enjoyed the pecan chicken which was absolutely amazing, paired with an oreo milkshake (equally delicious). Also, their broccoli casserole was crispy and warm to the bite. Their mashed potatoes were a bit bland so if you do order it, I recommend swapping out the taters for something else like their delicious sweet potatoe casserole.   Overall I had a good experience. Service was a 3/5, but the food was a 5 which is why I'd recommend Pikes a solid 4 stars.",

I wish there was more of a variety but i enjoyed everything I tasted and we were able to take some to go, which is always nice.

After he recommended the blueberry cobbler because it was to die for we went ahead and ordered it.  Not only was the service quick, but the cobbler was AMAZING! Our waiter was super awesome because he gave us a free scoop of ice cream with the dessert (automatic return just for the service).   The ambiance of this place was just as old-fashioned as its name. We kept ourselves busy by exploring the glass cases full of old pharmaceutical products from the early 1900's along with old phones and signs.

My client and I both loved the pecan chicken and our sides.

    "text": "Much has been written about \"Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop\" in local print and web publication so we, as a family, decided to give it a try over Father's Day weekend.  Now let me personally review \"Pike's Soda Shop\" for you...  Most of the people writing that this place is \"an authentic soda shop\" or \"retro\" haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors.  Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building, and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar.  So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed.    Concerning the food, I ordered what was labeled \"Meatloaf\" on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top.  I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn't care for that either, as there were breadcrumbs baked in.  My father ordered a club sandwich less bread, and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad.  You of thought they'd just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place.  He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \"just fair.\"  When dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress, and she then told me that their internet was down and that I'd have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families found themselves in the same predicament, and none of us could cash out.  While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure, and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we wanted to settle up and leave.  He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \"What are you talking about?\"  I said we've been trying to settle up and can't because you can't process cards.  This MOMO just kept staring at me until we got up and I told him to fuck the hell off.  What a dumbass...Anyways after twenty additional minutes, we finally were able to settle up and leave.  The service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more.  (1 out of 5 Stars)",

Parking can sometimes be tough... there are parallel spots out front on Camden and some lots in the back, but usually it works out.  The decor and atmosphere is great - Some of the items on the walls make it really cozy.  The old school pharmacy clock really is a great piece - makes you think about how soda shops were, way back when.  Nothing really flashy or fancy here... just good old fashioned food.  I love their sandwiches and burgers.  And for those of you who have bigger appetites, there are entree sized stuff just for you.

About 15 minutes later our waitress advised us that our food would be ready in about 2-4 minutes. 10 minutes later she returned and told us that our food was sent to another table and that our order would have to be redone. At this point I was appreciative that we were informed about the situation and that it was being taken care of. 30 minutes later our order came (which I think was almost given away to another table again). We immediately dug into our food because at this point we were hungry not realizing that my son's burger was not the burger that he ordered. He decided to eat it anyways because he was that hungry and didn't want to wait for it to be redone a second time. The waitress apologized for the mix up and offered us a couple of free scoops of ice cream for our inconvenience. I had already planned to order the fudge sundae before this happened so I requested for that to be our free ice cream instead. She informed us that she was not sure she could do that but she would check. Needless to say, we did get the fudge sundae however it was included in my bill and the waitress gave me $2 for my troubles. I am not sure who runs this place or who told her to do that, but that was TACKY. I ended up not taking the $2 and leaving it there for her tip, which would have been WAY more then that had this been handled the right way. I didn't even ask for a discount on my bill just for the free ice cream that was already offered to be a sundae instead of two measly scoops... I will not be returning and will not be recommending to anyone else. I get better service at Culver's and Cowfish, I will be sticking to those establishments instead.",

    "text": "We came here a few days ago with some family. We had heard this place was good so we figured we would try it out.   2 aspects I am reviewing:  Food and service.  Food: 5 stars.  Service: 1 star. Average of 3.   First the Food. I ordered the burger with homemade chips (apparently they don't have fries on the weekends?) The homemade chips were crispy and delicious. The burger had great flavor and was cooked to the correct temp (just pink but not red). My husband ordered the breakfast buffet and it was all very good. I tried his Cesar salad and broccoli casserole. I think that the broccoli casserole was the best I've had. It had great flavor and a crunchy top. The buffet is definitely a good option if you are hungry. They have breakfast and lunch options, so many choices available. The milkshakes are also quite tasty. I tried the Oreo milkshake and it was rich and creamy!   Now to the Service: We were seated fairly quickly, so that was good. When the server came to take our order, we asked what was good. She just said the burger. Ok, sounds good we'll order that. The table ordered 3 burgers, 1 buffet and a couple milkshakes. Not a tough order. The burgers did have different toppings requested... (i.e. one wanted lettuce and tomato, another wanted onions and bacon, and the third wanted all the toppings). There was a bit of confusion about the milkshake order. There was discussion about whether they would be ordered at the same time and come out with the meal or later after the meal. It was decided that the milkshakes would come out later.  My husband asked the server about the local beers. She simply said she didn't drink beer so she didn't know. Ok, I do understand that, but it would have been nice for her to say I don't know, but I can get Joe Shmoe who drinks all the time to tell you about them. My husband said he would look them up and pick one. She never came back to get his beer order.  When the burgers came out, they were all messed up. It was as if she had taken the order then scrambled it to see how many things she could mix up. Mine which was only supposed to have lettuce and tomato came out with mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, tomato and onion... someone else's who was supposed to have bacon and onions came out with lettuce, bacon, ketchup and mustard and the third was just a hodge podge of randomness. The server already seemed annoyed so I just scraped off my mayonnaise (ugh) and told her it was fine. One of the others in our group sent his back because it was so wrong.   There were only about 8 chips on the plate. It was a tiny amount... it was as if they ran out of chips and just decided to give everyone a couple chips to make them happy.   Finally, during the meal, someone asked if the milkshakes had been made because they wanted to adjust their order. A normal server would have said, no they haven't what would you like. She responded with \"no! because you told me not to make them until the end! Right?!\" she was extremely agitated that they were asking about the milkshakes. She never came and checked in on us to make sure everything was good...   All in all it was a quite unpleasant experience.",

    "text": "Atmosphere: The building is nestled perfectly with a decent amount of parking on two streets. They offer outdoor seating with area heaters if the weather is cold. As you walk in their is a bar with group seating on either sides of the restaurant. The decor takes you back in time and is almost perfect, save the full wooden tables. The music comes straight out of the decade.  Service: I sat down at a partially dirty table and my waiter came a speedy two minutes later to take my drink order. When he came back and took my food order he tried to change my burger to a custom one that would have had me pay more for the same ingredients. However, he realized his error after starting to write down what I wanted on it. He came back multiple times to check on me and I didn't have to wait long to get my check and pay.  Food: I had a Classic American Burger with fries. To drink I had a hand-made cherry phosphate and vanilla milkshake. My burger was juicy and moist. The pickles were thick and the lettuce was crisp and fresh. The fries tasted frozen but were still nicely cooked and seasoned. My cherry phosphate was not light or heavy leaving me very refreshed. The vanilla milkshake was amazing. I would probably say in my top 5 of any I've had.",

    "text": "This edition of Exited about Eating features a bonus since we visited two restaurants on a holiday weekend. Our first visit was to the South End of Charlotte to Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop.   Now when I hear Soda Shop, it brings back memories of diners that were located in drug stores forty years ago and this place meets the billing. We visited on a Sunday and they were serving their Brunch buffet which I was eager to try. Service was attentive and friendly, and brunch provided a wide variety of both breakfast and lunch selections and also quite of few sweet options.  For breakfast, the standout item for me was the biscuits with sausage gravy. The biscuits were light and fluffy and the gravy creamy with just the right amount of sausage. For lunch, the broccoli casserole stood out, tender, rich, and packed with broccoli. Also the scones and key lime pie were outstanding choices.   Dora here. Lots of carb heavy dishes, but not enough proteins for me. Some of my faves: blueberry french toast, coffee cake, and carrot cake. See what I mean? :) Flavor was great, but a tad lukewarm for my taste. I'm the gal who orders my coffee extra hot.   I would rate this establishment 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

My man and I ordered the vegetable plate.  You could chose 4 vegetables, or three and a salad.  We chose the salad with blue cheese dressing.  A very generous portion arrived, with fresh, crisp vegetables.  The dressing was a bit thin, and I would have enjoyed chunks of blue cheese. My veggie plate featured the mashed potatoes, fried okra, and broccoli casserole.  Oh my goodness!  Such incredible flavors that caused me to eat it all although I probably  should have stopped.  My husband ordered the same, except he substituted Mac and cheese for the potatoes. Our server was the sweetest thing and embodied real, genuine soda shop service. So, daunting parking aside, I am coming back.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this Charlotte staple. I've lived in Charlotte for so many years and I always overlook this little spot. After my office had some food catered from Pikes, it stuck in my head to give it an in person try. On Sunday craving brunch with little diner type spots to choose from, I decided on Pikes. With a a price tag of 14.00 for brunch, I was expecting to be blown away. Blown away I was not. Around noon we were seated right away however, our waitress seemed less than thrilled to be working. she wasn't rude, but not attentive and you could just tell she didn't want to be there. Hey, maybe it was an off day.  On to the food... despite what the sign in our booth said, Mac and Cheese isn't served on Sunday ( disappointment) My sister ordered a bare bones cheese burger and it was just okay. Thrown on the plate with some chips- not very appetizing especially for a place that calls themselves a soda shop...? really, that's how you present a burger?  On to the brunch, there was lot to choose from, but everything was just fine. The biscuits were cold, the scrambled eggs were bland and the potato casserole was drowning in cheese that you couldn't taste potato. The eggs benedict did look good,but I didn't try that. We sampled some of the desserts and those didn't disappoint. Next time I'm looking to drop 15-20 bucks on brunch, I would much rather go to Terrace Cafe or Toast. Pikes, I wanted to love you so so much, but I left very disappointed. *** with all that said, I will go back one more time and order off the lunch/ dinner menu, maybe that will change my opinion.",

As far as I can tell, Pike's is famous for its weekend buffet, which is like $14 (sounds like a lot, but it's as much as you can eat, and it's alll good). This gets you access to normal breakfast stuff (scrambled eggs, potatoes etc) BUT also southern treats like biscuits and gravy and grits (which are definitely worth trying). If you get there a little late and are feeling like lunch, there are options like meatloaf and various other meat cuts for your pleasure. Just don't go there looking for a light meal.   The best best part if the dessert. I know, dessert after breakfast feels a little weird, but don't deny yourself--great coffee cakes, cupcakes, and carrot cake. I repeat: i left stuff. and happy.",

My fault for not selecting a better menu option.  My two compadres ordered the BLT and both thought it was delicious.  Service a tad on the slow side.  Also had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table.  I'll go back for lunch and definitely for brunch.",

    "text": "I accidentally happened upon this place after hitting a furniture store in the area.  Felt lucky because I had the best milkshake I have ever eaten...  it was peanut butter banana!  And they give you a huge portion of it (fills up your glass twice).  And then I had the cobb salad which was good, too, and was VERY large!  Probably one of the largest salads I have ever seen.  And from the sounds of it, the desserts are supposed to be delicious.  Would definitely like to go back again and try one of those.  And I like the old school, soda shop vibe.  Definitely a cute atmosphere.",

    "text": "Just came here for a Mother's Day brunch.  We called the day before and made reservations for 11:00 knowing that it was going to busy.  We arrived about 5mins early and were told that the the table was just going to be cleaned up and we would be seated.  We proceeded to wait for half an hour.  We saw people get seated that had just put their names on the list while we waited, and these were parties of the same size as us (7).  Once we were finally seated we all decided to get the buffet which was kind of the special.  Once up at the buffet it got worse.  It seemed like they had been way overwhelmed. There were things on the buffet that were missing  like the prime rib, there was just a pile of the fat scraps and no one there cutting anything.  There were things that were cold and picked over as well.  Also none of the plates or cups matched, which is not really a big deal but just added to the unprofessional appearance.  I used to like going to this place when I lived here and thought it would be a good spot to take my mom.  It turned out horrible and I will never be returning here, nor recommending it to anyone.",

    "text": "The food here is great - my problem with the place is around two things:  ok although a minor problem it still is a consistent problem...every time I go I get a milkshake and every time it is not mixed well enough.  This results in huge chunks of ice cream you have to mash or wait for it to melt.  I dont like that.  The second problem I have with this place is the service.  I have gone four times at varying times of the day and always the service is subpar.  I end of flagging down the waiter for refills and begging for the check again and again.  But the food is good so if you are only interested in the food and the cute atmosphere then this is your place...not for me though.",

I LOVE the tomato basil soup there. Usually Im not big fan of this soup. But PIKE totally changed my mind. I will come back soon~~~",

Hers had been sitting a bit longer - the cake was dry.  The eggs benedict, french toast, carving station, & dessert bars certainly live up to what I would expect in a brunch.  We were seated quickly & the watier was very attentive.  Liked it so much took my boyfriend who has lived in Charlotte for 12  yrs & didn't know it existed.  We went before the lunch items came out.  Still fantastic but definitely recommend 10AM or after when the lunch, carving, & dessert stations are available giving the full brunch experience.",

The problem with this Pike's location is that they have a full menu that they don't seem able to deliver.  The last time i went i was quickly served my milkshake, but I left after waiting 25 minutes for my food (the waitress never came by and there was no one else eating at the restaurant).  The last time my parents went they said the food was ok, but that when they were brought their food originally both of their meals were wrong.",

If you can avoid the lunch rush do so, it can get kind of crazy at times.  But other than that it's a nice little place.  The chicken salad is great and the selection of ice cream and shakes can provide endless fun.",
