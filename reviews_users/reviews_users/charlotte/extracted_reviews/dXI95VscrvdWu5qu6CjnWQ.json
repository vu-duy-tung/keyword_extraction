    "text": "Wish I could give this place NEGATIVE stars. First off, I love tacos and USED to love this place but just today, I went back after some time of not going and was expecting A1 tacos like usual but this time I ordered 3 tacos, 1 steak, 1 Chorizo (Mexican sausage), and 1 Pastor (Pork) .. well they brought out the tacos and ended up giving me Steak and 2 tacos that did not look like Chorizo or Pastor. One looked like tofu and one was some kind of soggy greasy meat. I had them take it back, because that's NOT what I ordered and they took it back and made \"new\" ones.. when I received my \"new\" tacos they weren't new at all. IT WAS THE SAME PLATE. So, I told them I didn't want these tacos because they weren't good and I was a regular customer and they NEVER looked this way. After 20 minutes of arguing with the waitress that I wouldn't pay for these nasty tacos that I -DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH- she called the Owner over the phone.. which I was happy thinking the owner would accommodate me, well the owner was WORSE than the waitress and said that the meat is fine and no one has complained and that I had to pay for these tacos. I told her fine, I would pay but IM NEVER GOING BACK. She said she would cut the Taco price in half but why would I pay for tacos I didn't even eat? They're full of B.S. and a huge disappointment. STAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLACE!! What was once my favorite Taco spot is now a crap hole with rude employees. Moral of the story is they DO NOT CARE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL. They were more interested in making me pay $6 then my loyalty as a customer. HATE THIS PLACE. NEVER GOING BACK.",

The food was excellent, and my girlfriend and I really enjoyed our visit. We tried tacos of pastor (pork), chicken, asada (steak), and barbacoa. I wouldn't recommend the barbacoa, but all 3 of the others were simply awesome. The restaurant offers three side salsas, but the tacos were so tasty that we didn't really try them for more than a bite or two. I also ordered the torta albanileras, and it might've been even better than the tacos. The bread was super soft, and all the sandwich toppings went together really well and were high quality.  There are servers, but it almost felt like a hybrid between waiter service and takeout because you have to pay at the counter on your own and a few different servers brought out the food and checked on us.",

    "text": "Tacos El Nevado will likely be one of the more borderline Authentic Mexican places you find around Charlotte, the vibe is very kitschy and mostly everything on the walls and playing on the tvs will not be in English, so don't expect chain store tex-mex. If authentic isn't your thing, know the food, the prices, as well as the portions make up for anything that may get lost in those departments.  A few things to note:   * We read in another review that they gave you 3 kinds of salsa, but then charged you for chips. We did not have this happen to us, but admittedly, we got one round of chips and didn't get offered more, but we also weren't charged for them. You do get 3 kinds of salsa.  * The language barrier (could) be mildly problematic. My wife asked if she could have charro beans rather than refried, and there was no way the waitress was going to understand the concept of 'substitution'. After a few rounds of trying to explain, we just gave up and got the refried. Although she did come back and ask if we wanted a small portion or charro beans on the side, so that was nice. Also upon walking in we asked if we could sit at a corner booth, and we were simply told \"no.\" We later noticed it was because someone was sitting there, but either way, it seemed abrupt. But again, after the person left, we were asked if we wanted to move there. So, even though that barrier was tough to breach, the employees were still very helpful, although a bit distant at times.  * The waitress (likely) won't take your credit card up after dropping your check off at the table - you go up and pay at the window. For a new visitor, you may sit there for a long time wondering why your bill hasn't moved, this is why.   * The portions are very large for the price. I got a fajita beef burrito (huge), with a side of charro beans and my wife for the beef fajitas, plus chips and salsa, along with an extra steak that just randomly showed up at the table. (We didn't pay anything for it and we were told it was just 'extra'...we still don't know if that came due to a language barrier or the fact that my wife's fajitas seemed a bit scarce on the steak) either way a nice bonus. The total bill for an entire table of food was a bit over $22, and there was another full meal of leftovers. If we went back, we would get tacos, at $2 each you could try a lot for very little.  Overall, I would recommend trying it out, the language barrier is there, but shouldn't be a deterrent, and possibly getting something a bit more out of your comfort zone if you want a more full experience. You'll likely be more satisfied with an authentic tripe or carnitas street taco here than you will be getting a more common option like a cheese quesadilla.",

First and foremost it's the first Mexican restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life that brings you 3 different kinds of dipping sauce but doesn't provide chips. The best thing about this place was their avocado sauce which swayed us to buy an order of chips in order to have something to eat the sauce with. Turns out they were extremely stale. ;-( We also ordered their menudo which was actually very good, and their steak tacos which tasted a bit off. The worst part of this experience was the waitress, she was extremely rude, made us wait forever, barely checked in on us and the few times she did approach us walked away before we could even tell her what we needed.

Lets start with that my manager went to the one in east blvd. WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE for him. He was kind enough to buy us lunch and he asked us to choose so he place for him to pick up the food, so I choose this place becasue I love the food. My manager came back an hour later (we're only 5 minutes away) and said the service there was horrible and he felt uncomfortable on how he was treated. Yes he does not speak spanish, but the waiters should not be giving him a hard time. he said the ladies kept rolling their eyes and making bad gestures when he was asking for information. Ontop of taking one hour to make the food and he was waiting there patiently, that was very uncalled for. I usually never write bad reviews but I am very dissapointed at this restaurant. We work at a doctors office and we would not treat our patients on how he was treated there. I give this place a one star becasue of this. yes your food is amazing, but if the service is horrible then it makes customers not want to come back. Not coming back again. And I highly recommend people going to the one in central ave.",

Their chicken is amazing. I would rate a 4.5,  i have eatin at many mexican restaurants tho and am very picky.   Also their burrito is good as well. There are green beans and peas in it which i havent seen before and is a little odd.",

Queso is average but still it's white queso so I'm gonna dunk all da tings in it. The tacos al pastor is king here and the tortillas are made in house and so so good. And the cebollitas and hot peppers are great accoutrements. Don't expect this to be a hot date night place unless you are over the frills. Not much ambiance or cocktails.",

(And before you say, \"But, there are amazing Mexican restaurants in Chicago!\", just remember not all Chicago neighborhoods are the same - and there's no decent, affordable \"homestyle Mexican\" in the downtown area - just Rick Bayless' empire of over-hyped Mexican joints serving $55 a plate micro-portions of grilled steak with four artfully arranged black beans)   While our friends dove into classic burritos, like the $7.50 Fajita Burrito, and the mountainous Pollo Asado ($7.99), I caved in and ordered my favorite combination; the Coctel de Camarones (Shrimp Cocktail) was enormous, and perfectly flavored with onion, lime, cilantro and that classic thick, ketchup-based sauce. The shrimp were perfectly poached and the generous topping of avocado made the entire bowl creamy. The $2.25 Lengua Tacos (beef tongue) were outrageously tender and smoky, and with a healthy dollop of their avocado sauce, a perfect match with the cool cocktail. The sweet radishes were a nice touch - very seasonal and they added a nice crunch to the soft-shelled taco.  True \"meat and three\" dining! Lucky for the folks living and visiting Charlotte!",

Seeing boring white people get excited about $2 taco Tuesday at a white owned tex-mex chain is disappointing when there is an independent restaurant a little further away, making their own tortillas, and charging $2 consistently- for a far superior tasting product.   Come here, get several of the tacos al pastor and some queso and chips.  We make it out of here spending $27 pre-tip getting 8 tacos, queso and chips, a Mexican coke, and an extra side of cebollitas and chiles....like a pair of pot-bellies bandits.  Service is usually a miss but who gives a shit? There is sometimes a language barrier and I've never been to Mexico so I don't know if they're friendly at their taquerias to customers, anyway.

Gorditas were killer (really, get the gorditas!!!). The green sauce has a little kick, the red sauce has a lot of heat, and the onion slaw is good and cool. It's a small place, so even if the parking lot isn't packed the inside will be pretty full. A lot of people were ordering the horchata, so it must be good, but I opted for a Modelo.",

    "text": "Serendipity situation - stopped in to get some Horchata and the waitress was selling me hard on their tacos. Their horchata was amazing by the way. Took the bait and ordered a set of four carne asada tacos. Why not. Let's give it a try. Very good move. These weren't average at all, they were True authentic Mexican style tacos with juicy seasoned meat and soft warm flour tortillas. I knew it was a good play when every customer sitting in the restaurant was of Mexican descent and at every table, they had plates of tacos. Always quick scan your surroundings, that's key. Shoot, the name of the restaurant is Tacos El Nevado. I couldn't just come in and get an Horchata drink (which was still big time by the way, second shoutout) without showing respect and trying their tacos. Great quality meat with chopped onions, cilantro, and radish & lime on the side. That's the real Mexican taco way. This place did it right and checked all the boxes. Priced at about $2 a taco with good serving sizes of meat, it's a winner. Unsure if they do the deal here, but guess where I'll be at on Tuesday's. You know what time it is - it's TACO TUESDAY.  Sometimes simplicity is all it takes. Meat, cheese, and tortilla came through with a POW. Ordered a quesadilla to accompany my main course of tacos and it was well worth it. You don't need to get too crazy with quesadillas, and the good ones are packed with lots of meat without being overpowered by the cheese. Beef was far from dry and contained that Mexican grill flavor. Didn't even need to sauce this dilla up. The cheese pulled away gently and didn't stick on hard, which is critical when you're chewing. This allowed the steak to be the aggressive scorer, while the cheese comfortably sat back being a role player, delivering with big time assists. Another perfect pairing with my tacos to a successful dinner.",

Everything in the menu is great and authentic. Every time I come here my first choice is to have the special of the day because is fast, incredible fresh and inexpensive. Service is always cheerful and friendly. It is a super relax atmosphere full of Mexicans, like me, looking for a traditional comfort food, well prepared, using authentic ingredients.  This time I had the Enfrijoladas. Enfrijoladas: Made from scratch warm tortilla folded in half, smothered in a herb infused black bean sauce topped with Oaxaca and cotija cheeses and Mexican cream. Delightful! There is nothing more Mexican than that!",

    "text": "4.5  stars  Great dinner at this small restaurant. A Truly hidden gem, authentic homemade Mexican food.  Be aware it will be fully crowded during weekends.   So, I decided to go with my friend on a Monday night. There were 3 tables and ours. Love the seating.  The place is very colorful gives you good vibes. From the outside you can smell the food...I'm so happy I chose this spot.   Amazing and Authentic food! It taste so good! We couldn't believe how flavorful was the rice, beans, everything.  Our server Cindy, came with chips already made. They were hot! With 3 different kind of salsas.  Service was great, very attentive, knowledgeable and kind. All ladies around we're checking on us.  My friend got a Margarita, it was so cool!   For less than $10, a huge one and good. (other places are too small or with poor tequila)  Homemade tortillas. I got \"the hungry killer with salad\" Portions are BIG. The meat was so tender and flavorful.   My friend went with \"3 Mexican Tacos\". No leftovers for her. Stated it was delicious and full of flavor.   Tacos are $2 EVERY DAY!!! Really once again food inexpensive and delicious.  Only cons are drinks comes in bottles or cans, so no refill. And we hated the restroom was so dirty. That's why I'm only giving a 4.5 stars.  If you are looking just for child and salsa, or a fancy trendy mediocre Tex-Mex place. This is not the place for you.   Definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant. After being living in Charlotte for 3 years and a half I found it!   Other things to note: * You go up and pay to the window. * If you only speak English, make sure what you are going to order. (anyone hardly speaks English inside). However, menu is available in Spanish and English. * Portions are large for the size. * Remember there are no refills. * Even there will be enough space in the parking lot, inside will be full. (You can always choose different days or hours.) *Check appetizers, guacamole, alcoholic and none alcohol drinks like: American sodas (coke-pepsi) with waitress (they are not in the menu). * Address is correct (South blvd) but not the map. (make sure if you are not familiar with the area). * Dont mind about the 1 star's reviews. Probably they only went once and was for sure something out of the menu. * if you like/love Mexican food, this is a MUST!  Hands down! Be back soon for Tacos!!",

The beans were runny, the rice had some dehydrated and dehydrated peas. The beef burrito had very crispy beef bits that I didn't love.

Some are better than others and Tacos El Nevado would be one of the better ones.  It's a small place, not very extensively decorated and it was surprisingly full when I arrived close to 3pm. I was brought to a table and my order taken. About five minutes later, it was served.  Three delicious tacos topped with cilantro and onions. Attractively plated with a big piece of lime and several radish slices. One beef, one chorizo and one pollo, they were excellent. Lots of meat on here, the flour tortillas held together well. The meat was tasty if perhaps a little bit small pieces.  Very inexpensive. Three tacos with a Mexican soda and tip, just over $10.",

    "text": "I have been going here for about 2 years now & never had a complaint. The food is always good and the service WAS great. But I'm sad to say things have changed. Went to eat with my family and we waited for about 5 mins before we got seated. Our waiter came to take our drinks & order, I'd say the food arrived fairly quick. No complaints on the food expect that they do give ONE slice of lime for 5 tacos. Our waiter left & never came back to check on us, no one did. There was waiters asking other tables but not us... anyway we asked a random waiter for more lime & were told \"just a second\" & never received it. My husband had to go up to the register to ask for it. It's understanding when the restaurant is full but that wasn't the case. Probably will be ordering take out instead of dine in.",

    "text": "I just ate here for the second time. The first time I had the enchiladas, which weren't all that memorable. This time I had a gordita and two tacos. The gordita was delicious, and the taco al pastor was the best I've had in Charlotte. I want to come back and try more tacos and the tlayuda. My only complaint is that they didn't serve chips.",
