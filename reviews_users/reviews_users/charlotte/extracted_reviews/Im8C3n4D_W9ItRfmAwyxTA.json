Decor is sparce - blame that on Latta Arcade space...was very clean and I peeked in on the Hookah bar next door and there were a bunch of bean bag chairs in the hookah room...so I guess it's ready for business. All in all - good value/experience for lunch...kind of a poor man's Kabob Grill (not a knock on Metropolitan - it's better than most downtown lunch spots). Also my buddy got a chicken kabob on a turkish pita - huge sandwich that comes with one side....very reasonably priced for downtown.",

When I found Metropolitan Cafe I was excited to see that they served the doner kebab.  My excitement was short lived though.  I wouldn't even call this a doner kebab.  It was more like a mediocre gyro at best.  I'll keep looking and won't be going back here again.  I did eat a delicious gyro right across the alley from them though.",

We ordered four drinks and three of them Mojitos.  The bartender has no freaking idea how to make one and it was so overly sweet we asked for something else.  When she delivered them she was sloppy and short, then when we returned them even worse.  We apologized and even said we are good tippers but just want a good drink.  She was snappy and rude about her mistake.  You don't put sour mix in a Mojito, specially half way up the glass.  We moved outside because inside was so bad.  The weather was nice so that helped but overall the experience was so bad I would never, ever go back.  Even the hookah we got didn't work and they had to grab another.  Bad drinks, bad food, bad decor, then terrible service.  Don't go.",

    "text": "I've eaten lunch twice now at Metropolitan Cafe which is located in the Latta Arcard across from the Plaza.  Cafe is streching it quite bit unless cafe is Turkish for little dive hole in the wall place.  If you are looking for fine dining, even casual dining look elsewhere.  Cosmopolitan Cafe is really a get it and go place.  With that said, it has been busy both times I have been there.  No place really to sit inside, but there are 3 or 4 tables outside.  They serve Turkish cuisine, mainly kebabs and some vegetarian offerings.  The kebab thing threw me off the first time.  I ordered the doner kebab the first time around.  It wasn't meat on a stick like I expected.  It looked exactly like gyro meat to me.  So I googled \"doner kebab\" and up popped tons of sites.  Doner kebab is literally means \"rotating roast,\" and it looks just like a gyro roast.  I don't know whether it is cooked on site or elsewhere and brought, but it was good.  The entrees come with two sides and rice.  The sides are kisir, which to me looked like a version of couscous, which is made with bulgur, parsley and tomato paste.  It was also very, very tasty.  Other sides where a green bean salad, white bean salad, grilled eggplant salad, and cabbage salad.  They also had hot sides such as steam vegetables, which is what I got.  The veggies were way overcooked but still tasted good.  The rice was not just plain rice, but was creamy like a very thick risotto.  The second time I went there I got the doner kebab wrap which comes with one side.  The wrap is just that doner kebab in a choice of wraps (white, whole wheat & spinach) along with other toppings.  For my side I got the white bean salad which was very good.  You can take any of he sides and make a combo vegetarian wrap which seemed to be very popular.  The prices are reasonable, $6.99 for the doner kebab entree with 2 sides & $5.99 for the wrap.  The owner & staff are very friendly and keep the line moving.  Not much to look at, but the food is pretty good.",

I don't think it was anything spectacular - the rice was too mushy for my taste and although the description reads beef AND lamb, I only saw one or two slices of beef.

Although there was a menu with several options we were only given two. They were ill prepared for dinner service but I can imagine the lunch is any better. I ordered the doner kebab on turkish bread and received it on a wrap. After returning the wrap I then received the flavorless meat on soggy bread with no sauce. It was not even edible. I was happy that they did not charge for this mess however they made their money off of a beer they charged us $5 for. The worst part is the website that is so deceiving. We were served food in styrofoam! Sitting in an alley with broken glass and a stereo playing bad music loudly.

    "text": "Holly Molly! Bar Rescue please help these clowns! What can I say about this horrendous place?! Nothing nice since this is by far one of the worst places that I have been to in this town. From the customer service to the quality of their product and the tacky decorations, this place excels at being atrocious and quite frankly a True disappointment. If someone recommends this place to anyone, they got it hate them, because there's no way in hell I'll recommend this dumpster. Where do I begin? First, the staff is extremely rude. This was my first time visiting since I usually go to Crave and I was actually expecting someone to help us get a table. Instead, the lady was very rude when informing us that we need to find our own table and anything that we request we have to come to the register and order it through her. Even the basics as water, you have to get up and walk to the register to place an order. During this visit I was with a group of people and we decided to asked about the prices for a hookah and she proceeded to give us some of the prices for us to split. Anyway, when she came back with the amount, apparently she was trying to beat us for some more money and when we became aware of what she was doing, she became extremely snappy and condescending to all of us. She was so upset, we never saw her again.  Later when they brought the hookah, it was place on the ground and another waitress rudely informed us \"Can't put it on the table. If it breaks, I'll charged you $25 for the damage\". LMAO! Now, the inside. Very dark, very tacky and the couches? I don't have any back problems, but if you do, don't come here. I got a feeling they got those couches from a dumpster because it felt worn out and to the point I literally sunk into the couch. The food and hookah? Nothing to brag about. Food was small (but cheap) and what was coming out of the hookah was weak. I literally didn't feel anything and quite frankly, I was just blowing smoke. The fries were small and let me not forget, the menu is limited and the desserts are not truly available. Someone in my group order cheese sticks and apparently they didn't have no marinara sauce and only ranch as their option. Plus, the desserts were off limits. Advertised yes, but when we asked for an order they simply said \"we don't have anything to make it with\". And also, I wouldn't recommend eating at this place when they got a score of a 88 for sanitation and that's not a good thing at all. The only highlights of the night was all of us leaving and the view of uptown. It's crazy how they have a prime location to have a successful and thriving business, but everything about it is nothing but a headache and regrets. I'm suspecting clowns are running this establishment, because everything about it is laughable.  If someone recommends you this place, I'm pretty sure you have done an amazing job at pissing them off, because there's no way I'll ever recommend this place to anyone and that includes my enemies. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMPSTER!",

Some strange stuff was happening when we first arrived...seems like a popular hangout for teens. When we sat down upstairs (by the way they have an upstairs if you're like us and are completely oblivious haha) this group of kids were upstairs playing a weird ass game where you rock paper scissors then smack the crap out of each other. Yeah, no.  The lights were also super bright and the tv was going all white noise. The waitress fixed both of those and turned the room into a nice chill atmosphere to hookah.

    "text": "Just bad unfortunately. Went on a Saturday night for the first and LAST time.. It was slightly hard to find because of the construction downtown, but anyways, the seating upstairs was pretty cool in my opinion.. pillows, and ottomans in the seating area. Pretty cool. However, after ordering at \"the\" bar and going upstairs, the hookah took a while to come out. I was enjoying the music (mostly r&b, rap) so I didn't mind as much that the hookah was a tad slow. Upon arrival, the hookah was subpar to say the very least. It was not very flavorful or good.. at all. I also ordered wings while waiting for my hookah.. the wings never came. I admit they got pretty busy after we sat down, but there was no communication with the customers about late hookahs or backed up orders in the kitchen. The staff was rude, they would brush right pass you with hookahs without acknowledging you.. there was no interaction at all. They would bring the hookah, sit it on the table, not say a word to you, and leave. I asked to get our table cleaned because the previous customers left it filthy, and the employee's answer was \"Ummm, ok hold on\" She returned upstairs in our room at least 3 times, not once did she return to wipe our table down. The only friendly and professional employee was the girl on the register who took the orders, and kept the tabs open. She actually apologized for the slow and not so friendly service on behalf all of the employees. Lastly, the ladies bathroom was not in good shape to say the least. I will just keep going to King tut for now on.",

That's customer service, especially in a place that has food that some people have never tried before.  I assume they'll only do that when they aren't slam packed busy, but it's worth a shot to ask even if it is.  Lamb kebabs were awesome.  Very very tasty - the spices were so delicious, it almost didn't need the sauces (kinda thin, though - I could have stood for them to be a little more... meaty. ha!).  They give you a choice of a tomato sauce or cucumber sauce to go over the meat - I got both, but I think the next time I'll just get the tomato - the tanginess compliments the meat very well.  You get a pretty decent amount of food for $9, 2 kebabs over a generous helping of rice, and 2 sides.   They have a couple of tables outside and a cute little upstairs part that you can sit at to enjoy your food - and BONUS - there is also a little hookah lounge upstairs with couches and TVs - I'm all about the hookah (no funny business though, straight up peaches and cream tobacco, lol).  I can't wait to come back here and partake in some hookah and relax - that's my kind of date night.  And maybe next time I'll try a GIGANTIC baklava... they looked so gooey and delicious.",

And there shepherd salad was not at all a shepherd salad.

From the minute I walked in, the hostess/server was very attentive. She directed me upstairs and my drink and hookah was out in no time. The music is very mellow and perfect for this atmosphere (reggae). The happy hour (5p-8p) shisha is $10 and the flavor list is pretty extensive. I ordered some cheesesticks to munch on and they were nice, hot and gooey- just how i like 'em. If you're looking for a spot to kick back and relax, this is it! #exhaaaaaaaaale",

However, I have also seen the bad side of this establishment. I have been here when they have run out of multiple shisha flavors. When they have no beers or food items as advertised on their menus. The hookah's are dirty and unwashed most of the time. The sanitary rating is 88%, which is pretty bad for an establishment. Yesterday one of the alley bartenders told me that they let go of one of my favorite servers. I have heard of the two owners being shady and dating their own employees but I didn't think they had continued to let go of their best employees. There have been three other servers that have been let go in the past out of nowhere.  I am not going back to this establishment that doesn't take care of their product quality or employees.",

If I'm in the mood for a delicious scoop of hummus I often come in before the late night crowd and order off the Turkish Dinner menu. They've also just recently renovated the entire downstairs area and installed a new bar- which is great.  Definitely the best hookah bar I've been to in Charlotte.

Previous review: I like it here! This place does a speedy business during lunch, when all the Uptownians come clad in their blue button downs and tight black pencil skirts. I like the flavors, I love the price, and I like that one box lunch makes enough leftovers for a solid cold lunch the next day. The hummus is really good, anything else chickpea so far has been great as well (after 5+ visits), and the meats and rice are pretty consistent. All in all, an Uptown win!",

Found a nice nook by the window and settled in. It took about 10 minutes for our pipe to arrive.   The Good: Great music...The Eagles, Bob Marley, Tosh, Sound Garden all mellow and not too loud  Decent Shisha...papaya mango and mint mix they have a higher end grade also  Atmosphere...it was clean, smelled good, younger crowd in the room we were in but they were cool. Bathroom was clean. I informed a server there was no soap in the ladies and they took care of it right away.  Service...Unlike many lounges I've visited, you are not charged extra for a fresh coal and they come around to tap the ash off for you! Servers were very pleasant and didn't bother you but were available if you needed anything.   Food...we just ordered some wings because we had not eaten all day and they were pretty good. Trust me, I'm from Western NY and I know wings!  Location...It's in the cut and out of the way of the \"Uptown swank\"  The Bad:  Crowd...We didn't go in the other rooms(I think there are 3) but would have liked an older crowd. Right before we left there was a group that came in that did not understand that a hookah lounge does not call for the same volume of speaking as a bar! A etiquette blurb on the menu may be helpful at any lounge.   Food...would have liked to see some creativity on the menu but that may cause the prices to skyrocket so never mind.   Overall: I enjoyed it and will be back. The happy hour is daily from 5-8 $10 hookah. I'd like to try some cocktails on my next visit; maybe the \"Liquid Marijuana.\" It goes with the vibe;)",

They're reasonably priced, and if you get one that's not working properly they will take their time to fix it for you.  Otherwise, I would recommend you get your hookah craving from Crave.

The hummus was original. Maybe a spinach hummus? Made a little coarser than perhaps you might be used to. I liked its originality. They gave me a little warm pita but I def could've used more. The rice was bland but not terrible.   This is a grab and go kinda place. They use that godawful styrofoam (why is this stuff still legal??) we ate outside in the courtyard, which is quite nice.

The reason being is because of the rude bartender, service was so terrible I left!

So one of my friends ask is there a line or something? In this rude tone she goes \" yep it's right over there don't you see it?\" We all took offense and left that's ridiculous not to even acknowledge us standing right at the bar with no wait so we left. Will not ever go back!",

The \"meat\" in the doner wrap, if it can even be called meat, is over salted and tastes fresh...out of the microwave. Real doner has shaved meat off of a huge rotating slab. It's a crime. I hope a legit Turkish place opens and puts this establishment to shame. They should stick to hookah and drinks.",

    "text": "Charlotte has a great selection of foods from many different ethnic backgrounds. Metropolitan Cafe is a great spot to check out for lunch if you're on the go. When you walk in the place is nothing special. A small dark open room with the menu projected onto the wall to the right. A few high top tables and a counter that you order at. I've only had takeout since I normally take my lunch back to my desk when I'm in the city for work. They are located within Latta Arcade which is a really cool area of uptown Charlotte. I work just a few blocks down the street and having as many options as we do in uptown sometimes it's hard to make a decision on where to go. It's funny because I always found myself back at MC. One reason is because they are very quick with getting your food ready. Another is because the food is just great and the prices are right. I love the chicken kabob and also the chicken doner. I've had both the entree's and the pita wrap. The pita is great for light lunch and if you are really hungry I'd get the entree over rice. Both options are very tasty and offer sides that are also great. The sides change daily but they seem to have a few that are always available. Some of my favorites are the spicy beans, stuffed grape leaves, and hummus. MC is definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in uptown quick good food that doesn't break the bank.",

We were talking about what we wanted to order and in the middle the bartender interrupted us and yelled \"so you wanna start a tap or? \" I wasn't even at the point if I knew if I wanted to dine there or not.  Fast forward we decided to sit outside. I never knew that there was an upstairs lounge. The outside seating/ alleyway type thing was weird because there are only like 3 tables on their side of the alley. The other patio table belong to the other establishments and we were told that in order to take a seat at their tables they would like for you to shop with that particular business. Thats not the issue. It would have been nice to have been introduced to the upstairs at Istanbul.  All together it was cool because the outside had lots of characters roaming around. The hookah was cool and the replacement coals came regularly. The food was also quick which was a plus. The minus was that it was all frozen bar food, deep fried and served to you. With that being said, this hookah bar and its surrounding is more club/party like. If you are looking for that. By all means it will serve what you are looking for.",

The past couple of times I have gone, my experiences have not been the best. Last night was by far the worst. I was there with a party of 6, so a friend and I each ordered a hookah. Both the same flavor. The hookah I ordered did not pull properly and the flavor was very faint. I alerted the waitress downstairs and she stated that she would come help. 29 minutes later, I had to elicit her assistance again in which she told me that she was told that it would be extra to get a new hookah. She stated that someone could come upstairs and try to fix it. I agreed and no one came. I then asked for my money back, it had been 2 hours and the hookah sat there and everyone seemed to ignore my request until the gentleman helped me and stated that I should in fact receive a full refund. He is the only reason why there are two stars. I used to love this place. I am very disappointed in the lack of customer service displayed by the waitresses.",

So, I walked over and asked the girl behind the counter politely that my order is wrong. So she takes it back to the kitchen, comes back in 5 minutes and hands me the exact same order!!! She didn't even do anything with it. But, because I learned from experience I checked it there and then and told her that she needs to fix it. To which, she takes back inside and this time brings back almost accurate order, except hummus was missing. I point that out, she takes it back and adds hummus and brings it back. As I said, took only 4 tries to get it right!  All this, without even a word of apology!   (Wish the food wasn't nearly as good as it is or I wouldn't even contemplate going back).

We came in yesterday around midnight for a late night hookah sesh, it was not packed compared to other Saturday nights we've been in. After a while, we asked for a coal replacement and a beer from one of the servers who was bringing another customer their hookah. She said she'll get it started and bring it up. 5 minutes go by, another server brings up the beer and asked her if our coal change was coming soon, she assured us it was. 20 minutes go by, a third server brings up someone water and we ask for a coal replacement again. 30+ minutes go by, still no coals. My boyfriend had to go downstairs and ask twice. Finally after 45 minutes have passed from when we initially asked for a coal replacement and our hookah was completely out, one of the servers came out with coal replacements for everyone 25 minutes before closing. Not cool considering they rip the hookah away from you exactly at 2am. I was kinda pissed that they took out coals at their convenience, we asked so many times. Its just bad service. Especially since there were only a handful of groups still at the hookah lounge.   I am not ashamed to say I didn't leave a tip, I wrote a little note on our receipt explaining why they didn't receive a tip as well. I never not tip, that says something.",

They are great about replacing coals! They could replace some of the sofas that are broken but overall love going to smoke here!",
