It had Bibb lettuce, pears, candied walnuts, blue cheese, with an apple cider vinegar salad dressing! The service was great and this is also a great place to hang out with friends because you can play pool or sit outside. This place has plenty of space!",

    "text": "Went there on Saturday night with reservations at 830 pm during restaurant week. Didn't get sat unit 845pm. Put in order for drinks and upon receiving them put in an order of appetizers. 10-15 minutes later we were told that they didn't have anymore of the short ribs for our appetizer so we ordered something else on the menu as well as our dinner. Shortly after we were then told they didn't have anymore of our dinner entree as well as 2 other items. So we choose the Shepards pie since it was either that fish and chips or a ravioli dish for dinner entrees. Soon after I received my salad but still no appetizers. We didn't receive our appetizers till 945 and then got our dinner entrees at 1015pm. Our pretzel sticks appetizer were frozen in the middle. 2 people had burgers that did not taste like beef. Our Shepards pie looked like a deconstructed upside down smaller portion of a Shepards pie. The only good thing I can say about this place was the view of the city and the manager was nice. After all that we didn't finish our meals. My wife also had her IPhone 6 stolen from there as well. Would not go back again because it looks like there are plenty of other places to go.",

Also siphoned about 4 tablespoons of oil off of mine. Waitress was apologetic, but was very slow and did nothing. Eggs are not much of a culinary challenge... so not sure what was going on.

Huge portion and I had to take half of it home. Shaun presented me a desert menu but nothing was to my liking. I had asked my server if I might find something lighter for desert that was nearby and he took the time to consult with his coworkers. He came back and suggested a place right around the block. I really appreciated him going the extra effort even-though it took away from his sales. Would defiantly recommend this place and be sure to ask for Shaun.",

Walked in and it is a very interesting looking building, there is a roof top seating area also but it was 36 degrees here last night and not the time to sit outside. Our waiter approached us right away and informed us that wine by the bottle under 60.00 was half price and to our surprise they had Klinker Brick Petite Syrah! 13 bucks, half price that is a great deal! We looked over the menu and decided that we would have all appetizers. They all sounded so good we had a hard time deciding.  Our first order was for Devils on Horseback, normally it s Bacon wrapped dates but this was  Figs wrapped with Bacon and stuffed with Goat Cheese..(Is your mouth watering yet) served with a side of Arugula salad with tiny beets chopped up on it ...Wonderful! Our Next appetizer was the Duck Duck Mousse. A gorgeous plate with a Duck Mousse served in a little cup with sliced apple and two kinds of pickles, a Duck Confit salad with a pear Marmalade and sexy little pieces of Brioche buttered and sliced for you to spread the lusciousness on...It was really really good! (I think my favorite of all) Our third app was the Asparagus and Egg, It was really good smoked Asparagus with a poached egg over Pepperonota sweet peppers. And our last tidbit was the Lamb Lollipops, two very meaty ground lamb lollipops over a bed of hummus. The Lamb was incredible, grilled and  succulent. It was served with plain flatbread. The hummus was not so great but the lamb made up for it. Like I said..Peculiar , no, Incredible yes..I will be going back soon!",

Not an extremely large party, right.  OMG we ordered around 1:30pm  BY 2:55pm  OUR FOOD WAS NOT SERVED!   Our waiter kept informing us that the restaurant was \"slammed\" That is odd and not True because when I went to use the ladies room which is located on the 2nd floor, there was very few patrons eating there. Hmm perhaps those few patrons ate all the food in the restaurant??  OH AND SPEAKING of the ladies room, the sink was over flowing.    Meanwhile, when we were nearing an hour of waiting, and watching patrons that arrived AFTER us get their food, one would think that a manager would climb to the roof terrace and offer an apolgy, the truth or (just call me crazy) a discount.  To add INSULT TO INJURY, when we were at the 90 min wait point,  our waiter told us that he would bring some hashbrowns for us to share.   He returns only to inform us that they ran out of hashbrowns and biscuits.  HUH??? I ordered a biscuit for brunch.  I got up and left.    DO NOT GO THERE WITH A PARTY GREATER THAN 2.",

    "text": "The name and concept of the Peculiar Rabbit were enough to draw my attention, and when I found an online coupon for the place I was sold. The idea of getting some good food at a bar-like environment was intriguing, and we headed out Saturday night.  Finding the place is no problem, as it's the big three-story bar located across from the Family Dollar parking lot. Parking itself is a different story, and something that confused the heck out of us. We went at 6:30 (made reservations) and by that time there was no parking anywhere on the street or the lot located near Sherwin Williams. After circling a few times trying to find an actual spot to park in we caved in and parked in the Family Dollar lot, which requires you to give the attendant $5.  Once we were finally parked we walked into the place and I was charmed at first. It has a very nice interior that is ascetically pleasing and looAhhks pretty roomy at first glance. We were sat upstairs on the second floor, and upon sitting down and relaxing I realized that the overall noise of the surroundings was too much for me. Our table was right in front of the bar, so as the meal wore on and the seats at the bar filled up, people began having their drinks and conversations while standing...which happened to be right next to us! It wasn't long before I couldn't hear a word the missus was saying, despite being right next to her. I guess part of me expected a somewhat quieter setting for a \"gastro pub\", but once the drunken young women and disturbingly older men began chatting in arrangement of free drinks, I realized this was nothing more than a bar with a fancy food menu.  Ahh, the food...one of the redeeming qualities of the Peculiar Rabbit. First off, the beer is excellent. They have a nice selection and it is available in 10oz or 20oz glasses. My initial reaction was \"what, no 16oz?!\" but I found that 10oz was a suitable price... especially when I got a draft of Beckenridge Vanilla Porter for only $3.50! When we go out for dinner we have a beer or wine to go with our meal, not to get drunk on. Thus 10oz was perfect for us.  For dinner I ordered the Shepards Pie ($14) and it was done very, VERY well. I've had Shepards Pie at Irish places and found it under-seasoned and bland, but this dish was nothing short of tastetacular! They start with a heaping portion of ground lamb, which is not overcooked and tough but tender and juicy and greasy...just perfect. Peas and carrots are mixed in with it and this wonderful mound of meat and veggies is plopped onto a bed of mashed rutabaga, rather than the potatoes you would traditionally get. The rutabaga was actually better than potato and was much lighter, so I didn't get the heavy feeling in my stomach I would get after eating some mashed taters. Then they top the entire dish off with a thick layer of cheddar cheese that is simply divine. It was the only part of the meal I had to cut with a knife because it was so thick and chewy, and so, so good. The Shepards Pie is a great meal, and definitely worth the price of admission.  The missus ordered the Cioppino ($17), which is pretty much a spicy fishermen's stew. It consisted of scallops, whitefish and mussels drowned in this tomato stew that was heavenly. The seafood was all of good quality and cooked well, but the star of the dish was definitely the stew itself. It had a nice spicy kick to it and also retained an overall seafood taste. I ended up dipping my bread into the stew, which is something I rarely do. There is one problem with the dish though. The menu says it comes with shrimp as well, though the missus didn't get any shrimp on her plate. Also, even if there had been shrimp, the meal has little substance to it. It's just a plate of seafood. Granted, it's tasty seafood, but I think it needed some kind of starch or side to go with it, like pasta, couscous or risotto...something to make it a complete meal. No one can make a full dinner out of a few mussels, scallops, shrimp  (if you happen to get it) and some whitefish chunks.  All in all, the Peculiar Rabbit does serve really tasty food. My biggest concern is the ambiance, as I would only go back for an actual meal, and want to go somewhere that is less...bar-ish. The outside seating seemed to be a bit more our speed, and if we came back (which I would not be against since the food was good) we would wait the 30-60 minutes for an outdoor seat that might prove to be more comfortable and a little less noisy.",

In fact, the second visit was worse than the first....good thing there was beer involved.   My first visit I went with a pretty decent size group, we just went to have a few drinks and share some appetizers. There was no greeting, just stares....not even glances but  it looked like we inconvenienced them as soon as we arrived. Not a great way to start, we eventually make our way to a few tables upstairs and get some drinks...order some apps the crab cakes, fries and some wings. The food was fine (well the wings were pretty damn good) but after the crappy service we had it didn't make it worth it. Ugh.   The next visit (one day later) was equally bad...again we sat upstairs, the waitress never came over we had to go get her, she told us more of what we couldn't have than what we could...she rushed through everything....was slow to refill our beer and overall it was just very weird and uncomfortable.   One time, perhaps was a fluke...but twice....makes it the norm and I'll be glad to visit other places in the future.",

Seemed way more concerned with socializing with one another than doing their jobs! I was honestly shocked by the type and tone of conversations they were having with each other blatantly in front of customers. Would not return here for anything other than just drinks... attitude of the servers was a major turn off!",

I made reservations for a group of 9 for brucnh. The process was easy and we were seated immediately at 1pm on a busy Sunday. We opted to not get the Buffett, but it looked wonderful. The reason for such a bad rating is the service. There were 3 servers on the rooftop(which was not full) and it took us 30 minutes to get drinks and order our food. Our food finally came and looked wonderful. We did not receive silverware. We promptly asked the waitress who seemed to run away every time we tried to ask for her. We had to ask for silverware twice and tried to get some from another server who ignored us. Finally 15 minutes later we were able to eat our cold food with silverware. The food was excellent, but would've been even better hot. I don't think they should offer ordered food on the rooftop because the food and drinks have to be run up and down the stairs. The process obviously doesn't work seeing the other reviews seem to say the same thing. Unfortunately, I think this will be our last trip.",

One of us ordered a delicious \"sounding\" pancake dish of orange ricotta pancakes with pistachio and fig compote. Unfortunately what was served (for $11) were three thin pancakes with perhaps a single pistachio and a hint of fig. Server must have known since she offered to bring syrup.  My order was chicken and waffles with eggs and breakfast potatoes ($14). This dish had possibilities but chicken and eggs (overcooked despite my request) were warm while potatoes and waffles lukewarm at best.  Suppose I could have sent this back but no one came by so it was easier to just deal with what I had. The chicken was decent but overly salty. The potatoes seemed like they could have been cooked a day prior and were lifeless and could have been from a freezer bag and reheated in oven.  Mentioned all this to server who hardly listened but said she would inform the kitchen.  Guess I should have paid more attention to the yelp rating of 3.  We had been to this restaurant twice before and recall a wonderful meal the first time several years ago. Sorry to say though there is no intention to ever return.",

The music on the weekends at night. It doesn't make for a great atmosphere, the management seems completely out of touch with what people want.   The second floor has music blasting, most often for an empty bar, and if you want to grab a beer with some friends and just chill (like one does at a pub) it makes it impossible.   The rooftop is the place to be only because of the view, the DJ isn't very good and you often see what looks like the bar management really getting into it behind the DJ while most people don't share the same enthusiasm.   I used to like this place but I try to avoid it these days. Plaza needs a good all around bar to go to, a place like Gin Mil in Southend where you can dance inside if you want to, chill with some friends either inside or go on the roof. What used to be a great go to rooftop bar has quickly become a place to avoid, try again later and regret.",

It financially makes sense based on the size of the normal $5 ones, but there are nicer places in CLT that are less than $20.  3.) we asked about vegan options and were told the flatbread without the quail egg on top would work. Right as it came out to our table, our server came up to tell us that the naan they use has eggs in it. So we asked about another dish (I forget the name, but a potato, Brussel sprout, kale dish) being made, again without the eggs on top. They came out about 15 mins after the rest of our party started eating. Overall the food was good (albeit a bit salty), but now a few hours later my stomach is killing me. I am guessing there was butter or some other animal product used because potatoes and veggies alone shouldn't cause this type of reaction. 3.) despite being misinformed about vegan options then needing to wait well after the rest of our table ate, nothing was comped or discounted.  Overall I actually would return and give them another shot (probably just for drinks), but I will say that it is 2018 and not having a single vegan item on your menu is really shortsighted.",

    "text": "The food and drinks were great. However the manager that worked during brunch on 1/8/17 was aweful! I ordered a meal, the NOLA Benedict, but the bartender-in-training put in the incorrect order (the regular eggs Benedict). I got my meal and began eating because I was hungry. However, after eating a few bites my girlfriend and I quickly realized that we had not received the correct entree. We asked the bartender if it was indeed the NOLA Benedict, to which she replied she \"didn't know there was more than one Benedict on the menu.\" She put in the new order for the NOLA and everything was great until we received the check. The bartender told us that the manager said that because we ate some of the meal then we had to pay full price. It was not our fault that we got the wrong meal and this having been my first time at the Peculiar Rabbit I did not immediately realize we received the wrong meal. I pulled the manager aside to confirm that we were to pay full price for a meal we didn't order in the first place and he simply said \"yes.\" I told him that was f**ked up customer service and he replied with \"O.K.\" I gave him the remainder on the original meal to throw away because I didn't want it in the first place. I've worked in the service industry for years and I've never seen a manger let a customer leave upset without doing anything to remedy the situation! He didn't even have the manhood to tell me himself that he was making me pay full price, he let the bartender-in-training do it! He was just aweful!",

    "text": "I had told myself I was going to wait, but last week as we were walking towards Soul for a late dinner we changed course and decided to try the Peculiar Rabbit. I'm happy we did, but I'm also looking forward to the changes they make after completing their \"soft\"opening (which we thought was over then, but most likely is by now).  We walked in and asked if we could sit up top, they told us there just happened to be one table left (yay). I'm guessing, as others have mentioned, that they've been cutting back on full seatings while they work out the kinks because there were multiple tables open on the roof. But the view is really nice.  Our server was great, but after telling us they were still in opening stages I was surprised he was handing out three menus to both of us. I was completely overwhelmed, and since this was a last minute decision I didn't have the recommended flashlight packed - so we read by cellphone light. The first oversized menu is beer on the front, restaurant menu on the back, the second is solely wine, and then a smaller manageable card was the bar menu. Having a separate drink menu isn't abnormal, but not everyone at the table needs one, especially when you're already trying to work with a larger sized menu in the dark. It would have been hard enough to take it all in with proper lighting, so after I found what sounded good I just had to stop squinting and hope for the best.   We started with the PBR mussels, and they are amazing. I wish I would have ordered two bowls of them. A few weren't completely purged (not exactly pleasant, but it happens, I understand) but the flavor was fantastic. And the bread they serve with it is tasty as well.  My banh mi, oh my poor banh mi. Apparently a member of the kitchen staff is of Vietnamese descent so for a moment I thought that I was in the wrong with only Americanized versions in my head - but there is no way this sandwich could have been right. Since I don't have night vision, I can really just describe how it felt - like a soft meatloafish portion of (nice flavored) meat on a barely toasted hoagie roll. Mush on mush. There were a few pops with the occasional veggie, but the mayo-like spread on the bread smelled heavily of cloves or anise or something I couldn't exactly put my finger on, but it was potent. Needless to say I left over half the sandwich on my plate. At least it was accompanied by a sprinkling of fries.   The ribs were not a hit either, but as my dining partners stated - bad ribs are still ribs - as he cleaned his plate. It was on what tasted like a sweet corn puree, which I liked, but that's as much as I tried.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, unfortunately all of the games in the game room on the second floor were broken that night so our plans to take our drinks downstairs for a round of video bowling were put on hold. I'll definitely try the Rabbit again, and I'm hoping they'll 1) add some lighting up top 2) fix the games 3) trim down the menu.  As far as the pricing - one appetizer, two entrees, one beer (bottled, on the larger side), and one glass of wine - $50. Not exactly breaking the bank, but next time I'd like to want to finish my food.",

So, I dragged my friend to lunch so we could try this new addition to the neighborhood.  We went on a Saturday and found out they do brunch on both Saturday and Sunday. I never argue with brunch. I decided to try the apple jacks and my friend ordered the FGT BLT. I also ordered a side of the Benton bacon per the waitress' recommendation to have with the apple jacks. It took all I had not to eat everything on my plate! The portions are large and the flavors are amazing. I would have been fine if they had given me double the amount of goat cheese and lingonberry preserves on my apple jacks, but then I guess there wouldn't be as much for everyone else. The hash browns are incredibly crispy and very difficult to stop eating. By far some of the best I have ever had. I was also able to try the FGT BLT (FGT = fried green tomato) and what a great take on a BLT. The bread was perfect for the sandwich and perfectly grilled.   As soon as we finished all I could say was \"when are we coming back?\"",

Now, the negatives - out of 2 apps and 2 entrees, only one was above average (pork belly entree), 2 were average at best and 1 (the bahn mi) was inedible... it was so bad we had to push it aside otherwise we were getting a bit sick from it - not exaggerating.  We ultimately had them take it away.  It was like a rubber sock covered in fish sauce and slapped on a hoagie.    So that's it... just average for food.

The beer is over priced for the neighborhood (this is, after all the neighborhood of the Diamond and Common Market).  The food looked good, but the descriptions on the menu made it unappealing to everyone in our party (and $8 for a side of french fries is ridiculous).  There were a couple of TVs, but this is not a sports bar or even a place to go \"watch the game\".    The service was substandard.  The roof has a GREAT view (but no bar).  The decor is fun, but very ... unoriginal.  There are a couple of bumper tables on the second floor ... but I don't think it's nearly as game-centric as it's sister bar -- Jackalopes.  I'll come back again in a couple months after they've gotten their feet wet, but my first impression is that they have already lost their identity in an eclectic neighborhood dominated by bars with vision (Soul, Snug Harbor, Whiskey Warehouse, Thomas St, CM).",

    "text": "We had to pick up my son from the Amtrak station this afternoon and decided to take a detour and try one of the restaurants in Plaza Midwood.  After driving around for a few minutes my daughter chose The Peculiar Rabbit because she liked the name and the building looked kinda cool with its different levels.  There were only a few people dining on the patio on this gorgeous day. (I had wanted to try Zada Janes because the patio was full of hungry diners, evidence in my opinion of a place with good food.  Shoulda.)   We were seated upstairs right away and had a decent view of the Charlotte skyline.  Our server was great; prompt and attentive to our drinks.  We ordered the hummus appetizer and it took only a few minutes to arrive.  There was a generous portion of the tasty hummus and  crispy thin slices of baguette.  I inquired about the size of the salads and the server told me they were on the small side, which was not a problem. My daughter and I ordered the watermelon salad with chicken and my husband ordered the house salad with chicken.  He played it safe and was smart.    The description said there was watermelon and pickled watermelon rind, so I was expecting some nice juicy sweet watermelon chunks in addition to the pickled rind.  It also listed puffed quinoa;I didn't really know what \"puffed\" quinoa was, but I figured what the heck, quinoa is good so I'll try it.  The dressing was a cucumber watermelon vinaigrette.  When it arrived, it looked pretty good, a little larger than I expected, but I was a little skeptical of the brown gritty crumbles on top.  The first taste of the watermelon was shocking because I wasnt expecting both it AND the rind to be pickled.  Furthermore, there were tiny little chopped pickled onions throughout.  I thought ok, I can skip the watermelon, since there weren't that many chunks, but OMG the puffed quinoa was akin to chewing crushed gravel!  I'm not sure what it's purpose was other than grind down my molars.  It pretty much ruined the rest of the salad because it was stuck to every leaf of arugula.  The only saving grace was the chicken and the dressing.  Since the menu wasn't that big, I doubt I will ever go back to see if I liked anything else.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for my visit to the Peculiar Rabbit.  I had found the restaurant on the renown National Eater heat map and after checking out the restaurants website and menu, I was very excited. The menu was a bit of a hodgepodge with everything from Shepherds Pie to BBQ Sliders to Chicken n Waffles, but there were several things that caught my attention. In addition, the view of downtown Charlotte from the rooftop looked amazing. Unfortunately, this was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have had in a long time.   Atmosphere- 1/1 The view from the rooftop is amazing. It's one of the best views from a restaurant in Charlotte. Unfortunately it began to rain and we would be forced inside.  Inside still has a good feel to it, but we were clearly disappointed in the change.   Food- 0.5/2 *No matter what, this is where a restaurant needs to earn its keep and the Peculiar Rabbit fell way short of expectations. I had looked up the menu prior to coming and knew exactly what I wanted. However, the waitress informed us that the menu had changed and everything I wanted was no longer offered. The waitress recommended a few popular items, but had failed to try most of the menu. We ended up getting a burger and tacos. The burgers were said to be big 1/2 lb burgers with lots of flavor, it turned out out to be ok and small. There was no way it was 1/2 lb. The tacos were pretty good but they came with a side of bland rice and a black bean paste on top that looked completely unappetizing. The food was ok, but I was expecting much better.  I left still very hungry.   Price- 0/1 *Our meal was grossly overpriced. $12 tiny, bland burger? $15 for 3 small tacos and a terribly looking side? No thanks. I hate spending $30 for food I don't like and doesn't fill me up..    Service- 0/1 *Listen, I'm not one to be overly critical of the service I receive. I just want a quality meal and somewhat attentive service. This was one of the worst service experiences I've had in quite some time. Here was our experience: -Waitress was friendly but not knowledgeable of the menu.  -As mentioned earlier, the menu had drastically changed and was not reflected online. When I asked about a menu time that was no longer listed, the waitress informed me that they were no longer serving that. Often, I've experienced that the waiter/waitress will go make a special request to the kitchen, but not here. Wasn't a big deal, but a little disappointing.  -As the rain came, we noticed ever other server came immediately to the assistance of their patrons. Our waitress didn't show up for 5 minutes. We were hesitant to get up without notifying her so that we wouldn't confuse the wait staff and sit in a place that we weren't supposed to. We were definitely a little wet by the time the waitress got back to us.  -As we were moved to the bottom floor, our food came out a bit cold but not terribly. Since my burger came with French fries, I naturally would have liked some ketchup. Not our waitress nor anyone else came up to ask if we needed anything. I finally had to go to the hostess (who was very pleasant and helpful) and ask for ketchup.  -We did not receive one refill the entire night.  -Our waitress was not seen again after we moved to the bottom floor... Not once.  -No wait staff or manager asked how we were doing and if we needed anything.  -After we finished eating, our empty plates sat in front of us for 5-6 minutes as probably 20 wait staff walked by and did not offer to take our empty plates away. I finally had to once again ask the hostess for a little help in taking our plates and getting the check. It was the hostess who got us our condiments, took our plates and got our check.  I could have EASILY walked out without paying, no one would have noticed.   It turned out we got lost in the shuffle during the move from rooftop to bottom floor. It happens, I understand that. But this was more than one waitress mix up, this was an entire wait staff that had no intentions of ensuring that we had a good experience. Once the mix up was identified, there was no one and nothing done to make us feel like a valued customer who regrettably got lost in the shuffle. Just barely a disingenuous \"sorry.\" I've never not left a tip, but if there was ever a case this should have been it. I ended up tipping about 10%, which was generous and honestly should have gone to the hostess.   I have a feeling that if I visited the Peculiar Rabbit again, I would have a better experience. The restaurant really does look fun, it's in a great location, great atmosphere, enticing menu, etc. But I will not be coming back to the Rabbit. I'd rather spend my money where I enjoy the food and am treated like a valued customer. Disappointing.  If any staff from the restaurant would like to speak further about this experience, I would be happy to. Feel free to contact me through Yelp at this time. Thank you.",

I got the chicken for dinner and my fella got The Peculiar Rabbit; we agreed that mine was better, but his was still pretty good.  This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood - creative food, craft beer, good service and warm atmosphere... throw in a great view, and it's quickly becoming my new, favorite place!",

Our waitress had serious issues and was extremely rude the whole time because we came in 45 minutes before the kitchen closing.

The food was overpriced and mediocre, except for the orange juice. That was some damn good orange juice.    It took forever to get our food and the staff was mostly rude and stuck up. Overall I wish I stayed home and ate hot pockets in my underwear instead.   Also they took over the free neighborhood parking areas and are charging $5 for parking there now. WHAT IS THIS.

    "text": "The Peculiar Rabbit is a pretty large bar/restaurant. When I first heard about it being built and finally opening, I thought it would be more of a \"bar food\" type of place. I was wrong. It does have that bar feel and is would be a great place to head over after work with some friends for a cocktail but I was surprised by the menu.   The menu has some unique twists on various dishes. I don't know that I have ever given figs a chance but I do now. The goat cheese stuffed figs wrapped in bacon are something I think about probably a couple of times a month now. They are sooo good. The bacon is not too crisp but just enough that it wraps around the fig and is drizzled with a beet reduction sauce #OMG.   For dinner, I had the mushroom risotto. Another great choice, but I think this might be a seasonal dish and not one of the regular items. And since we were out for my mother's birthday, what dinner would be complete without a little dessert...so we ordered the seasonal cheesecake which hit the spot.   Overall, I would recommend this place for anything from after work drinks to date night. I would not suggest this place for children for various reasons.",

Entranced by the live music and cute stringed lights, we decided to give this a try.  The rooftop was too long of a wait for us, so we sat outside instead, which wasn't that big of a deal for us. We had a musician playing guitar in the background, and surrounded by a lot of chill dogs and dog owners relaxing for the evening with drinks. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxed, and the service was prompt. Our server did a great job checking in on us throughout. To our surprise, Wednesday nights had half price alcohol, so we split a bottle of red wine! Great price for decent drinks!  The food itself is colorful and unique. We split a Portuguese flatbread, which was actually pretty good, but a slight too salty for my taste. I also ordered the fig and pistachio salad, which was decent as well. The squash was pretty hard, but the rest of it was tasty.  Overall, a great place to have a drink and relax--you won't be rushed, and you'll be thoroughly taken care of.",

    "text": "Been here a couple times... mostly for drinks, but never really gotten to have a sit-down meal here until recently.  Probably hands-down the best roof-top seating area in the city due to the restaurants position in Plaza Midwood overlooking the entire Charlotte skyline.  Great place to have a drink and watch the sun set.    Unfortunately a place with a spectacular view didn't have the food to match.  There menu sounded pretty amazing, but it seems like the food execution was off when I went the other day.  We ordered the short rib grilled cheese and roasted brussel sprouts and my friend ordered the chicken and waffle sammich with bourbon creamed corn.  Pretty much the only thing that was memorable were the brussel sprouts so that may be saying something.  Servers and staff were pretty nice... towards the end the rooftop got fairly busy so the two servers were running around like crazy.  Kudos to those guys since they have to run up and down stairs all day fetching people's drinks and food.  Onto my other pet peeve:  parking... sometimes I avoid Plaza Midwood altogether because of parking - or the lack-thereof.  We were lucky since the lot off of Thomas street had one person leaving as we pulled in... otherwise it is full on MAD MAX - everyone for themselves side street parking... and even the \"RAP\" reverse angle parking spots are usually all filled up.  Once you find a spot, you are good, but it is pretty stressful driving around and then having to walk through some alleyways to get to where you are going.  Overall a great location - I think everyone should experience a sunset from the roof of the PR at least once.  Going back for the food - I'll give them another chance, but I may stick to liquid dinners here.",

    "text": "I hesitate even giving this place two stars. I've been to the Peculiar Rabbit at least five times. It's easy to get in when the other restaurants are packed, and they have a great outdoor space, so it ends up being at the default restaurant to go to Plaza Midwood.  First off, why does a fully stocked bar not have a cocktail menu??? I know they used to have one at some point. I ended up with a beer instead, which was ok.  I do like the menu, but the food never tastes as good as it sounds. Last night I got the lamb pita and it was pretty bad. The meat was so dry, served room temperature to slightly cold (although the pita was nice and hot), and didn't have anything inside except two cucumbers and a small piece of fig. My boyfriend ordered steak with a garlic mash.  Steak was cooked pretty well, but the garlic mash was so strong that I couldn't even eat it (and this comes from a girl that cooks with a TON of garlic).  Service was incredibly slow. I really don't understand why it took 45min to get our food, and we never really saw our waitress. This seems to be the theme almost ever time I've gone to Peculiar Rabbit.    I would recommend this place if you're going with a group of friends just to have a few drinks and apps (and you only need to see the waitress about every 30min to order another drink). Otherwise, there are other places around Plaza where you can get a good meal, like Fuel Pizza, which was where I went afterwards to get a slice since I was hungry.",

We thought it'd make a great way to end the evening by having drinks while enjoying a view and healthy dialogue. Until the Manager came and told us we had to leave because all seats were for the reserved. I guess she forgot she spoke with us 2-5min before to tell us how lucky we were to catch the best seat of the house. We politely thanked her and continued on with our intimate conversation. Not to mention, not one host/hostess notified us of required reservations upon entering.  When we looked around, we noticed all the other African Americans at the facility were being asked to leave as well. I usually do not blame race (because I want to give people the benefit of the doubt plus I always see daffodils and daisies); however, it was the first time in a while since I'd felt it blatantly apparent. It made me regret my decision to move back to \"the South.\"  Otherwise, the service - especially from the Manager was terrible! She tried to offer free drinks to compensate for the fact that she was basically kicking us out for no reason. I will never go back again. My money is just as valuable as all other patrons so I'll use my buying power else where. If I could I'd give this place no stars.",

The place is big and has an upstairs rooftop and a cute sitting area downstairs by the entrance. It wasn't loud so me and my friend could actually have a conversation.   We ordered the shrimp tacos for starts, they were good, but I think they could do better, the tortilla was very cold when it got to us, the flavor of the shrimp was good though.   I ordered the Salmon plate. that was very good... Service was slow at first but then they seemed to be more on point towards the end. I will comeback",

We got the purple cauliflower enchiladas, the rib grilled cheese.... and the rabbit grilled cheese.  Soo good.  The waitress said they get a new menu every 6 months. We do feel like you don't get your money worth for everything though. My husband and son were still hungry after they finished everything. If the prices were lower... or you got more food, it would be more worth it.",

We had reservations, sure we were a big party but when I made the reservations we were told to arrive 10 minutes early to be sure to get a table on the roof. Well the hostess didn't like that at all and she made sure we knew it!  We almost made other plans, glad we didn't Natalie was a wonderful server.   Thanks Natalie!!",

The service was haphazard and confusing. The waitress didn't seem to know what she was talking about and kept forgetting about us.   Also- I should note that buying a bottle of champagne and a carafe of orange juice like they suggest does not actually save you any money (in fact it might be more expensive than just getting regular mimosas). The bottomless mimosa price is also ridiculous at $25 unless you plan on sitting there all day.... mimosas are $5 each and unless you plan on drinking 6 mimosas at brunch the deal makes no sense.   Once our food came it got even worse. Everyone who got the eggs Benedict (which was most of our party) couldn't even eat it because the eggs were so overly funny. They weren't just funny yolks- the whites were barely cooked at all. It's really unfortunate because it's a great atmosphere but I will not be back.",

Anyway-- whatever it is called-- it has spiralized sweet potato noodles with a sweet and spicy asian-influenced sauce. It had shrimp and pork belly and brussels sprouts and all kinds of other fun things. I tend the eat a paleo-based diet and very often I struggle to find something on a menu that I can eat and if I find something-- I often make many modifications. This dish was not that way. I enjoyed it right off the menu, as-is. I loved it! I have debated driving over there to order it again-- it is just that good. Get over there and try is asap!",

That being said, the herb biscuits were definitely a standout, both in my wife's biscuits and gravy and my country breakfast plate. We will be back.

However, I was not pleased with the parking.  I prefer a restaurant to have a parking lot instead of random street parking.  We ended up parking in the CVS lot.  I couldn't even eat comfortably because I was worried that my car may get towed.  Besides that, the food was really good.  But the service was super slow for some breakfast food.  My recommendation is to know what you plan on ordering before arriving at the restaurant.  That way, when the waiter asks for your drink order...you can go ahead and place your food order.  And once you place your order, be prepared that it's going to take 20 minutes regardless if you ordered a plate of eggs.  Crazy, I know.  The food was good enough for me to come back.  Just know that the service is slow.  I wouldn't come to Peculiar rabbit if I was starving and wanted food to quick.  I also would be skeptical that they could handle a large party well.",

It game with hummus that was pretty gross, pickled cauliflower - which was probably the best thing on the plate, flavorless pitas, and some olives.  It wasn't awful, but we weren't impressed.  I wish we had stopped the meal there since it went drastically downhill at this point.    Our waiter decided to come by only when we asked for him for things like forks, napkins & water...since they have runners that bring out the food.  The place wasn't even busy when we were in there and I saw him taking pictures with the other staff and laughing...  I ordered the Bahn Mi and it was just so bad I couldn't eat it since it was grossing me out so much.  My husband ordered the burger and it was burned and beyond well done which is ridiculous since he asked for it to be medium.    One of my favorite parts of the night was when we were sitting around waiting for the bill and surprise, surprise, he was no where to be found.  When we asked for him again, he brought the check and we paid with cash - he asked if we wanted change back...if we said no, the tip would have been 50% of the bill! I was kind of impressed he had the nerve to even ask if we wanted change back.  After waiting forever for our change, we left as quickly as we could.  I would never ever ever go back here again.",

We have enjoyed the food here on two previous occasions, and went again for lunch.  After we were seated with menus the server came to ask what we wanted to drink. I asked about cocktails. She acted like I was speaking a foreign language, she didn't know cocktails. I pointed to the menu and said, \"I want something alcoholic that isn't beer or wine... a cocktail from the bar.\"  She told me that all of the ingredients for their cocktails were out of season, so I couldn't get a drink from the bar.  Now, obviously this isn't True. They would have made me something... but this girl was just so stupid that she couldn't comprehend what was happening.  As we were walking out the general manager stopped us and asked what was wrong. I told him, and he confirmed... they had no specialty cocktail menu because all of their ingredients were out of season.  If I were an investor in the Peculiar Rabbit, I would be worried. Not serving cocktails from their well-stocked bar is like pouring money out the door, instead of into customer's glasses.  We will never return.",

So we decided to wait at the bar and have a few drinks. Thankfully, the drinks were great and the bartenders were on point :-)  Unfortunately, an hour went by without any sign of a table :(   We eventually asked the hostess and were seated within 5 minutes just to find out the kitchen was running an hour behind on tickets (We arrived at 7:45PM and were sat at 9:00PM). Our server was great and extremely attentive. And eventually the food was delicious (at 9:45PM)- we ordered the hummus plate, onion rings and the po'boy sandwich. All of which were prepared well and tasted great! Though these were delicious, we would have ordered actual entrees if it wouldn't have taken as long.   I believe there was mention of a new chef, which understandably can be stressful on a restaurant. But I really think the ball was dropped on communication here. We have been to Peculiar a million times and have always loved it. Servers, bartenders, and food have always been great. Hopefully this one time was a fluke.   Will be trying again and hopefully writing a better review. Fingers crossed :)",

It was ok but something was lacking, order was wrong, waited forever for drinks, just not what we had in mind for a night out. We didn't want the night to end so we decided to come to the Peculiar Rabbit and we're so glad we did! We went to the rooftop and it was a tiny bar, seemed lacking, but we sat at the bar even though they only had 3 seats.... We were like what! The bartender just so happened to get to know us and he did! We spent the whole night at the bar, swapping stories like we knew him out whole life! Graham took the time and added a personal touch that is lost nowadays! Graham's the man and it was like he wasn't just our own personal bartender but a friend! We'll definitely be back! Probably tomorrow, hopefully he's working!",

    "text": "Very peculiar indeed.  My experience yesterday afternoon went something like this:  I walk up to the hostess stand and smile.  There was an awkward pause and the two hostesses stare back at me w/o cracking a smile or blinking or saying hello or greeting me.  I felt uncomfortable.  I awkwardly said \"I have 3 people in my party.  Is this where I put my name down?\"  They, again, stared back at me and told me that there was a 20 minute wait without smiling or blinking.....  Awkward pause.  Me: \"So is this where I put my name down on the waiting list or is there another hostess stand?\"  They finally took my name and gave me a buzzer.  What was that all about?!  Me and my friend, who showed up after the weird encounter, proceed to the bar area to get her some caffiene.  We asked the bartender for a cup of coffee and you would have thought we ordered something weird like ...I dunno...sushi?? The whole situation just got weirder.   He gave us this  vibe...kinda like we had put him out.... but later came to realize that he was having a terrible day. He told us what was going on and we instantly felt bad.   He didn't have coffee at the bar, but ran and made her a fresh pot and told her it was on the house.  That was way cool.    So we sat at the bar waiting on our third party.  Bartender was actually really nice, friendly, and was good at making a mean bloody mary (that didn't make your mouth feel like it was going to ignite on fire)  Met some really friendly locals at the bar and chatted while we waited.  And waited.  And ...waited.  20 min turned into 40.  *sighs*. FINALLY we get to our table.  Service was SLOW.  Not our servers fault, but for some reason the kitchen was backed up and we were warned about that right when we sat down. Great.  Glad I'm starving.    We ordered and if it weren't for the great company, I would have been irritated at how long it took to get our food.  I know one girl at the bar had waited for her call in order for an hour.  Foodie Call driver was there picking up an order as well and she had been waiting 30 minutes for it.  Not good.    Food finally came out and It was really good.  I mean really really good....but such a small portion.  I ordered the omlete and I guess I expected it to be more filling. I guess the waitress felt so bad that we had to wait for a long time, she brought my second order of mimosa in a giant wine glass.  Red wine glass full of mimosa made all things wrong...right again.  ha! (and it was only $3.00)   I'll have to come back when it's not at the peek of brunch time.  They do have the best bloody mary's, though.  The food was good, just took too long and was a smaller portion than I expected, and the hostesses are SLOW and not friendly....or weren't awake.  Oh and they ran out of bloody mary mix .....and the bartender said it happens almost every other Sunday.  How does that happen??  *shrug*",

We had a very large party and they did their best to take care of us.The food was good and drinks were average. The manager, Nicole, however, was less than pleasant. She was extraordinarily rude to the servers and essentially accused us of trying to not pay for all of our food. When I reminded the server that he had already charged the girl at my table for an entree she said to the servers: \"You guys are responsible for anything that isn't paid for, so you better not mess up\". If I were the owner and I knew that a manager was treating employees this way, I would be very disappointed.",

We wanted to eat on the rooftop bar so we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated but it was worth it, it has an excellent view (especially at night).  I ordered the caesar salad to start and it was delicious. Normally I don't flip over things like salads but this was possibly the best caesar salad I have ever eaten. It was grilled hearts of romaine and the grill flavor just made it excellent. They also use homemade dressing which is a major plus.  I had the grilled cheese with fries for my main meal and was really happy with both, the fries were extra crispy which I like. My friend had the pork and pimento cheese sandwich and the the only complaint was wishing it had more pimento cheese on it. She had the honey sriracha brussels sprouts for her side and they were heaven, the perfect amount of sweet and spicy.  Will def. come again.",

    "text": "A girlfriend was kind enough to invite me out with her to the Peculiar Rabbit to burn off a gift card that she had, otherwise I would not have ever visited (odd parking situations turn me off - I am an old lady).  I am so glad that she invited me outside of my comfort zone - what a great evening!  The parking... yeah.  There are some parallel spots around the building, but at 5:00 on a Saturday, these were all full.   I drove around the block once to try and check everything out and ended up parking in one of the back-in spots (eek!) on Commonwealth.  When we left around 8:00, all spots everywhere were full - had I encountered that, I would have bailed and told her I caught a case of the plague.  Even though we were meeting very early, I made reservations on Open Table on the off chance that everyone was going to be sick of family and turkey the Saturday after Thanksgiving and bum rush the place.  After 6:00ish, the place really picks up and they were slammed for the rest of the night that we were there.  Very cozy ambiance, comfortable seating.  High top tables and chairs in the bar area, tables throughout the rest of the first floor.  I was seated immediately, even though I was early and the hostess asked if I wanted water and brought it back almost immediately.  Our waiter for the evening was Christopher (?) and he was right on top of things.   My dinner was the Turkey Lurkey, which was a turkey burger with sage mayo, craisins and.... I don't know.  It was good.  Served with a side, I chose the mashed potatoes, which were fine, but the turkey burger was awesome.  Well seasoned and extremely juicy, YUM.  My dinner date is a vegetarian and they made the Holiday Risotto veggie friendly by omitting the turkey.  We split the Oreo truffles for dessert (balls of smashed Oreos covered with chocolate), which was served with glasses of milk.  Deeee-licious and so rich.    We sat there for a while eating and chatting.  Drinks were kept filled, our waiter was fantastic.  It was all around a great evening and I would definitely go again (early, so I can get a parking spot).",

I was a little peeved that we asked to sit inside bc it was so hot out an the hostess sat us upstairs (where it was super hot) in the middle of trivia night that was \"almost over\" but lasted the entire time we were there (over an hour). Meanwhile the lower level had plenty of open seating.  The atmosphere doesn't seem to match the pricing. The drinks and food seemed to be that of a nicer restaurant, but its a BAR. The food was good but not worth the cost.  So I guess if you want to over pay for your food and drinks and sit in a hot bar, THIS is the place for you!",

    "text": "I have eaten at The Peculiar Rabbit multiple times. I've always found the food to be interesting, priced ok but let's be honest you eat here to sit on the roof.   I arrived at about ten til 6 on a Saturday to a completely empty restaurant I was told that we needed a reservation and could not be seated at all. The hostess was quite rude about it. I am not saying she was lying about being completely full with reservations. But the restaurant was in fact completely empty. The hostess did offer up the bar areas as open seating but then mentioned that the bar areas only included the bars. The bar area high tops were  reserved. Lastly the hostess begrudgingly (read: we had to ask about it) offered up the outdoor patio as open seating but warned us if it starts to rain, we wouldn't be able to move inside. The undertone was that we should probably go fuck ourselves.    My advice to management: always keep a line, can't do that if you don't take walk ins. Also don't hire shitty people.   My advice to anyone that absolutely has to eat here, like someone (probably your girlfriend's friend that you don't really like) is holding a gun to your head and will blow your brains out if you ask to eat anywhere else: try the Lamb Burger and steal the pint glass.   My advice to people that don't fall into the aforementioned categories: go some where else. There's some amazing restaurants in walking distance.   UPDATE: actually made it to a table this time. (I went kicking and screaming with a large group)  Bypassed the bitch of a hostess as the group had already been seated. Our server was good and the food was pretty tasty. They did refer to their beer cheese as Rarebit, which I assume is a throwback to the restaurant's self proclaimed English roots. It's simply not accurate: Rarebit is rarebit, beer cheese is beer cheese. I gave them another star for the food.   At the end of the meal we had to hunt our waitress down for checks, and several people had to speak with a manager to straighten things out. I am sure large parties are especially difficult, and things handles professionally, but still a pain. I still probably won't be jumping at the bit for a return trip.",

Originally set up the event a couple of months ago with an employee who was let go (now we know why) who never booked our event and refused to respond to me.  So I called the restaurant today to confirm the event and they didn't have us down! I almost freaked out and then the manager, Kate, was so incredible and calmed me down immediately!  She told me not to worry, \"we will take care of it, just give me 30 minutes and I'll get you sorted.\"  She called me back and had arranged drink tickets and food etc.  She was INCREDIBLE!! I was so impressed that she pulled it together so quickly and so well, especially when I gave her no notice.  I was SO grateful.  She assigned us JT as our own helper.  We were either his only people or he absolutely made us feel that way.  He was SO attentive and fantastic.  No one ever went without a drink, he brought the food out for us to enjoy and was courteous, had a great sense of humor, and was nice to everyone.  He was the perfect person for our group and I am SO grateful to JT and Kate for making this event happen for us!  We loved the patio, it was so great!  The drinks were wonderful and the general vibe was just so much fun.  The event was a huge success, and we even came in slightly under budget!  I would DEFINITELY recommend the Peculiar Rabbit.  If you go, ask for JT!  And Kate is an awesome manager who knows how to handle a crisis!  Thank you so much Peculiar Rabbit!! We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This place is probably the worst thing that ever happened to the history of the known world.  Admittedly the atmosphere is pretty sweet.  Great views of the city, although parking can be a little difficult.  The food, however, I initially would want to call unremarkable but I can't.  I can't call it unremarkable because it is so incredibly remarkably terrible.    I ordered a club sandwich.  It took 45 min to get to my table after I ordered.  After about 30 min I was informed there was no turkey, so they would have to substitute turkey with chicken.  That was fine.  At this point I just wanted my food.  When the sandwich came, my sister who was also with me said the following: \"Your sandwich looks like something they would sell at a gas station in South Carolina\".  I think that was a completely fair assessment.  For a $11 club sandwich and 45 min wait, I had pictured a sandwich carefully crafted with shaved ham and turkey (as advertised on the menu).  What I got was a slab of ham steak slapped on two pieces of bread.   I'm positive I could have made a better sandwich from my play kitchen as a 3 year old.    My wife ordered a burger medium well.  It came out about as rare as I've ever seen meat.  At this point though we had been waiting for so long she just went with it.    To put in perspective how terrible this place is, this is the first time I have ever signed into yelp and wrote a review, and I would consider myself a serious foodie.  Bottom line:  If I owned a gun, and was walking in a field with a \"peculiar rabbit\" just ahead of me.  I would shoot that rabbit dead.  This place is terrible.",

    "text": "After a few less than stellar visits, here's short:  The food is creatively attempted, but without remarkable flavor and tends toward overpriced.   The tap is not interesting. The beer is expensive. On top of that, the staff doesn't seem keen on letting a person hang around and have a few--which at the price is probably a good thing.   The wait staff is terrible. Just terrible. The service is slow to get to you, then inattentive until they want you gone. I have not had a nice, friendly experience on any of my visits. This is key.   All of that wouldn't rate a one-star rating, this puts it over the edge:  The folks at PR have decided to start charging for parking spaces across the street; this impacts not only parking for the rabbit, but also all of the venues around, which have traditionally been open after the shops close. Since they can't seem to make bank with their mediocre food, apparently they need to make up the difference by screwing the neighborhood.  This fact makes them not just an overpriced and uncomfortable place to kill time or have a meal, but an actively bad actor in the community. My advice would be 'avoid' if that weren't True. Since it is, my advice is to actively oppose.",

    "text": "If I could leave zero stars, I absolutely would. Where do I begin... we were seated around 7:30 and ordered drinks and food. Our food came out at different times for a group of 6. For my burger, which was ordered as it appeared on the menu, it did not include the actual ingredients for which it was sent back. I sent it back only to be told to take my side off (Mac and cheese) to hold on to as they fixed my burger. They brought me back the same burger with the ingredient added, and at this point it was cold. I spoke to a manager about this and never being asked by our server for more drinks. The waitress then came over and asked if I wanted food because the manager didn't know if I didn't want food, just my food comped. My friends had all received dinner as I sat there with their food. We were still not asked if we wanted more drinks after an hour. It then took another 30 minutes to receive my burger and Mac and cheese and for my friends to receive a side of sweet potatoes fries. We never saw the manager again who had avoided eye contact with our table when he came up to the rooftop. Not only was our experience unacceptable, but as a former server, it is absolutely embarrassing for the waitress to come back to our table complaining about the breakdown in communication between her and the manager. I am making sure to tell everyone I know to never visit this establishment.  Update: when I received my burger and Mac and cheese, the manager came about 30 minutes later to ask how it was and when I told him that it came out warm but was completely well done instead of medium he said, \"well that's progress\" and walked away.",

    "text": "The only thing peculiar about this place is the fact that the food isn't that great. There is so much opportunity here for them to do and provide better!   My best friend wanted to celebrate her last day in the QC dining at a place that had a stellar view of the skyline so she chose PR. She made dinner reservations for the rooftop on Tuesday (8-30-16). I showed up early and was immediately seated and provided menus. Zack, our waiter, was awesome and answered all of our questions about the drinks and food. Draft beer and bottles of wine were half-priced so we both went with beer. I had the DELICIOUS shoffhoffer (sp?) grapefruit that was on tap.  We both went with burgers: I chose the aloha burger with fries and my friend went with the ghost pepper burger (minus the ghost pepper) with Brussels sprouts (per the waiter's suggestion). Our food came out and I was kinda disappointed. The flavors of the aloha burger were very underwhelming. I could barely tell that I ordered anything other than a regular burger because I couldn't taste anything resembling what was in the burger's description. Also, I kept thinking how this place should take advantage of providing seasonal menus. Like, why on earth are they serving anything with squash during the warmer/hotter months?  Yes, it was quite lovely dining with an awesome view of the skyline and watching the sun set but it would've been even better if the accompanying food was better. There's so much opportunity Peculiar Rabbit, I hope the food improves!",

    "text": "I've gone to Peculiar Rabbit on a few different occasions- brunch, lunch, dinner, just drinks- you name it. The view from the rooftop is pretty amazing and the restaurant is in a convenient location if you're in the Plaza Midwood area here in Charlotte, BUT THATS ABOUT.   SIDE NOTE: There are gems in the area that actually are worthy of your time, money, and patronage (for ex: SOUL GASTROLOUNGE, WORKMAN'S FRIEND, shoot- even THE DIAMOND DINER)  HOWEVER, the service at PECULIAR RABBIT has always been inconsistent, questionable, and sub-par despite the day and the time I have decided to go. That brings me to my most recent and unforgettable experience with this sorry excuse for an establishment.  This evening, I submitted an online order through YelpEat24 app. I received an order confirmation, notifying me that the order was received by the merchant, Peculiar Rabbit, and that my order would be ready for pick-up in a 10-45 min time window- FIRST, what kinda time range is that? (RED FLAG along with the other past experiences I should have taken into consideration). I decided to go pick up my order after about 25 minutes. I arrive to the restaurant and I wait about 5 min for the hostess. Kate, hopefully you were somewhere giving someone else proper service. After greeting her, and telling her that I was there to pick-up my to go order that I had put in and received confirmation for about 30 minutes ago, she told me that they were no longer using the YelpEat24 app. And that they no longer had the items I ordered.    Ok, Peculiar Rabbit, I got questions- none of which Kate had answers for apparently when I was there.    Why do you have the menu online? And if you aren't using YelpEat24, why do they have your menu up? Why haven't you contacted anyone sooner about updating the menu? Why was my order confirmed? Why did I have to come all the way to the restaurant for someone to tell me that my order could not be processed, despite notification that it was being made?  Why did Kate give me an explanation conveniently different from the explanation she gave the YelpEat24 customer representative and the one she gave me?  Why did Kate tell me there wasn't a manager or another person I could escalate this issue to? Who in the world is running the restaurant? Alledgedly, NO ONE. Last question, when are you guys gonna get it together?   I am not surprised Peculiar Rabbit is trying to pass off blame, or has no answer for its horrible service, or lack thereof- it has become a pattern that i will no longer doubt or question, and probably will always consider JANKY.  I'm honestly not sure if the management at this place will ever figure it out- but hopefully something changes.",

Multi level restaurant with tons of seating and several cool bars - check. Great location in Plaza Midwood - check. Great outdoor patio - check. However, this place just always seems to come up short.   I will say the last two times I have been here are on Mondays, so you can take my review with a grain of salt. Drafts of beer start around $6.50/ea and the menu is fairly simple pub fare - a little overpriced IMO. I do wonder how they keep this place running as every time I have been there is always a new server (I mean the \"its my first day here\" kind) who never seems to have the support they need to pull off large groups or answer questions about what is on tap or what is coming out of the kitchen. This normally throws up a big flag in my book for high turnover due to lackluster management skills. Case in point, we had a group last week out on the patio and no one in the restaurant apparently knew where the switch was located. It took about 20 minutes to get the chef out who knew where the switch was located. Odd and overall small situation, but just goes to show how keeping good staff can create a better overall customer experience.   My big takeaways are the menu feels uninspired, the drinks are priced on the high side, and the general experience just doesn't contain the \"Wow\" factor you expect when you pull up. It's frustrating as they seem so close - \"good bones\" kind of close. I hope they can figure out a way to pull it all together.",

Let me begin by giving you the best reason to go... the view. The skyline view of Charlotte is still one of the best in the city. Go on a date, go to impress out of town friends (if you're not eating), do not go to eat.   I say 'anymore' because I used to like coming here... their chicken and waffles was one of the best in the city. Came with eggs for brunch or Brussels sprouts for lunch or dinner. It was my faithful go to.   But let's stop playing nostalgia. We sat at the rooftop with some friends a few weeks ago... The service was slow and they only had a limited menu. The food was just not well executed. The bread was stale, the fries were scarce... not what I'm accustomed to for out of town guest trying to give them the best Charlotte has to offer.  I'm usually not this harsh, but the linear progression down of this place makes me feel that it's no longer a good option in my book.",

They've got delicious food, a range of drinks, and a great view of the city -- enjoy brunch or dinner with this view of the Charlotte skyline. When the weather is nice, this place is bustling.  I recommend the Shepherd's Pie: this entree is DELICIOUS! This dish is made with English peas, rainbow carrots, celery, onions and tender pulled lamb, topped with wonderfully fluffy double whipped potatoes and sharp cheese. Hello savory!  I also recommend the Chicken and Waffle Sammich: this sandwich is huge! Low country spiced fried chicken, bacon marmalade, and honey nut drizzled arugula make this sandwich what it is. If you get this sandwich for dinner, ask for a side of maple syrup (you only get syrup included with the brunch version of this, so you have to ask for this separate if you like your sandwich sweet).",

As we continued to wait we looked down on the street and see the same server yelling \"f_ck peculiar rabbit I quit\" while pointing his middle finger towards the restaurant. Well I think that was our server and we still waited in the blazing heat for waters someone finally came to greet us after 20 min and apologized and explain how our original server just quit Blah blah blah yea bro we heard but can we get waters it's hot.

I went out to the rooftop as on an 80 degree night at dusk, this should be the draw.  I should have known something was wrong when there was only 1 couple and a group of 4 guys out there.  I sat there for 25 minutes and got no service.  4 different staff came up to check on the other groups and all ignored me and my attempts to flag them down.

The 2nd floor of the restaurant provides for a cozy evening enjoying dinner with friends followed by drinks and a beautiful view from the rooftop bar.  The menu is extensive with something at each price point.  Besides the pimento cheese appetizer, nothing really stood out as amazing on the menu.  That is not say that what I had was not good, it just wasn't stellar.    Peculiar Rabbit has pretty good food, but it's appeal isn't really the cuisine.  PR provides a great space in Plaza Midwood where you can gather with friends for drinks or dinner.  The drink menu is wide and sure to appeal to the beer fan or wino.    Lastly, I see all these issues with the parking.  Let's just face it, most of the restaurants in Plaza Midwood do not provide parking.  So park on the street like you would have to if you went to the Penguin, Common Market, Thomas Street and so on.",

    "text": "I have no idea what's driving some of the overly negative reviews here.  But in short, we had a wonderful experience from start to finish.  In long...  First, the whole parking thing.  Yes, there's a convenient lot right across the street that charges $5.  This is a complete non-issue if you are planning on having dinner, because you are going to drop $50 if you get drinks, starters, and a couple entrees and the restaurant will credit you back the $5.  That being said, the restaurant didn't set up shop in a strip mall with 9,000 open spaces, so deal with it, really not worth griping about.  Second, the facility.  As Charlotteans, we should be thrilled that someone was willing to invest so much money in the local food scene.  It's obvious someone spent a whole bunch of cash on this place and it really shows.  I didn't go upstairs, but the bar area is really nice.  Beautiful wood finish, warm, cozy, inviting.    Third, the service.  Nice greeting, quickly shown to our seats, and drink order taken almost immediately.  It was clear there is still a bit of a learning curve for the waitress in being able to talk about the menu, but for a place that's relatively new, I don't really mind if she has to check her notes a few times.  She made some good recommendations nonetheless.  Fourth, the food.  We started with the English Cheddar Rarebit and Lebanese Lollipop.  Rarebit was buttermilk biscuits with a nice beer cheese and tomato confit.  Biscuits tender and flaky, great strong cheese.  The Lamb skewer \"lollipop\" might have been my best bite of the night.  Tons of flavor in that bite alone and that's not including the Hummus and salsa fresca it came with.  Starters, big hit.  One minor nit was that our bread came out after our starters.  It was very good, crusty homemade bread, but the butter it came with was heavily salted.  Not sure if by design or not.  A bit too salty for my taste and I tend to like salty.  For mains, I got the Oxtail Poutine and my wife got the Mussels.  The Oxtail Poutine was off the charts savory goodness.  I mean, house cut french fries with oxtail gravy and cheese.  Very heavy dish but crazy delicious.  The Mussels were very good as well.  Make sure to save bread or ask for more to use in the Mussel broth.    Lastly, dessert.  We got the Car Bomb.  Chocolate pate, mouse, shortbread.  It was really good, but my wife is more the chocolate person.  I would have gone for the fresh doughnuts or fried ice cream.  All of this ended up being way too much food.  We were able to share and we could easily have dropped one of the mains.  All in, before tip, we spent $66 including alcohol.  Dropping a main would have put us around $50-60 and I don't consider that a bad investment for dinner date with food this good.  Way better than spending upwards of $100+ for a fancy steakhouse.  So, bottom line, ignore the star rating and give this place a shot.  If you are a fan of the gastropub genre, this place is well-deserving of your $$$.  I'd love to go again.",

The funny thing is the patio and 1st floor dining room was barely half full.  We said ok, we will go elsewhere.   Went across the street and ate, then came back to watch the game about 45min later and have a few drinks.  We walked in and went upstairs.  They sat us immediately  (only a few ppl up there) and handed us menus.  I queationed why they were able to serve us immediately.  The waiter told us the kitchen was just backed up and the hostesses were told to tell people there was a long wait so they would go away.  To me..thats just bad business.   We still decided to stay for drinks.  The bar and wait staff were good and attentive.   The watching experience wasn't great.  They didn't have the volume up for the game, they were just playing music.  The waiter told us the management doesn't want the volume up and that it's not a sports bar.  Crazy right?  The tv's are small and placed it horrible locations.  My opinion the management needs to fix some issues.  They are missing out on revenue for game days.  The bar is beautiful and in a great location in Plaza Midwood, I hate that it is not being used to its full potential.",

We went around 8:15 with no reservations and was told there would be an hour wait..not bad for a Saturday night.  Sat at the bar and had a glass of riesling with the mussels,  very good! The broth and the tomatoes paired very well, although the menu said it came with crusty bread but my bread was a soft sourdough..ehh. We waited for 50 minutes and got our table for four. My husband ordered the bbq ribs, sooo delicious!  Nice crispy on the outside, tender on the inside saucy ribs with a creamy corn pudding side. I had the butternut lasagne..amazing. Surrounded by a tomato pure sauce, it was not overly cheesey with tender butternut squash and a creamy bechemel sauce. My mouth is drooling thing about it. I ate it all lol Too full for dessert, but I will definitely be back here!",

So when I learned their grand opening was last night, a few friends and I decided to try it out. We made a reservation so we were seated immediately as we arrived, at a large table on the main level.  The beer selection is on point, and our waitress was very knowledgeable about each craft beer on tap - we were thrilled to find that their imperial pints were on special for the grand opening (yyyeeeessssss!). When it comes to the menu, we were all kind of disappointed. The dishes run the gamut - not in a good way - and just seem mismatched. My table ordered the beet salad, oxtail poutine, and fish and chips. Our server just kind of walked away in the middle of our ordering and we had to flag her down to finish...very odd.  The wait for our food wasn't very long at all. Unfortunately, we were all kind of bummed with our dishes. The beet salad, while beautifully plated, is just...there. Cut up beets with some goat cheese and bean sprouts. Meh. The fish and chips got an A+. The poutine....woof. The fries were thin and mushy, the gravy had started to gel, and the cheese was sparse. Super disappointing.  Maybe in the near future they will tame down their menu and adjust their pricing (as of right now, for what you get, it's definitely not worth it). Proceed with caution.",

We are two adults with an 8 year old and 3 year old twins.  We really, really liked the brunch menu.  My husband had two different fancy beers, which he liked.  I didn't have anything to drink, but saw some other folks having yummy looking Bloody Mary's and Mimosas.  But it was the food that was delicious!  Husband had a burger and I their version of a BLT.  The kids had burgers and grilled cheeses.  We were all very happy with our meals and I thought mine was really yummy!  Today, I went back for lunch with a girlfriend.  I had the Vidalia Onion Bisque and my friend had a chicken wrap thingy.  She LOVED her lunch and snarfed it down.  My soup was fine, but I'm honestly less of a cream based soup fan than a broth based soup fan.  So I would have liked a broth based soup option.  It was still fine.    We are planning on going back again.  When we were there for lunch, the let us wander around the place looking at the views.  The upstairs view of downtown is worth coming and having a drink or three with some friends!  Kind of fancy for Plaza-Midwood!",

Was greeted warmly by the hostess who even gave us some good natured SEC ribbing which I always appreciate.  We were confused by the absolutely empty 1st floor, but  frankly it was kind of an off time for a Saturday. But we forged up to the 2nd floor and  caught our groove at the bar. There were several  groups dining and few folks at the bar.   Just there for a quick bite and drink, we ordered a couple of beers and perused  their light-bite ( lunch?) menu. Chose the soft pretzels - a win - and the asparagus with poached egg - also a win.  Bartender was pleasant and professional.  They definitely spent some coin on the renovation and it looks great but perhaps a little, generic? Which is not a bad thing, just no funk or flair like some of the other neighboring joints.  But, CAN WE STOP WITH THE GASTROPUB MONIKER, PLEASE? Disclosure: After spending 10 years on the West Coast before Charlotte I am BEYOND OVER the use of the the term Gastropub  so maybe I am just being a big crank about that.  Moving on... The 3rd floor - outside patio - has fantastic views of the city and I am always a fan of more outdoor seating with a view. The biggest misstep in design for me is the lack of outside bar upstairs. It screams for  bar.  Overall, I though the Peculiar Rabbit was perfectly A-OK. Would like to check it out again at a different time, taste some more food and see how the vibe changes.",

    "text": "Great food with a gorgeous rooftop. Been here a few times now and there's a lot of hits but quite a few misses as well. To start off, the food is beyond tasty and props to the chef for coming up with eccentric flavors that simply just work well together. Stopped by after a yoga class on a Friday and shared a slew of apps - we ended up getting the pretzels, the disco fries and the devils on horseback. Gotta admit, the disco fries were way better than I first anticipated, topped with gravy, shredded cheese and cilantro. The devil was bacon-wrapped figs with goat cheese and a sweet beet sauce. Awesome after workout chill spot on the patio and we really enjoyed ourselves.  Last time I headed over was for lunch with a few co-workers. The service was just not good at all. The server never smiled and hardly ever came by so our glasses were constantly empty. Our order took almost 30 full minutes - really? 30 minutes during a lunch hour on a Wednesday? I ordered the turkey burger with a side of beer cheese soup and both were great... just wish I could say the same about the server. But this seems to always happen with the service. I've only had good service one time (after the yoga class) and every other time it's been slow or unfriendly. Or both. So I always make sure to come by only when I'm not in a hurry... which really is a terrible thing to have to do.   On a side note as well, know that at night you can't grab a table without ordering food. If you ask for a table but are only ordering drinks, you'll be asked to move. Seriously. Even if the tables are empty you must sit at the bar, stand or go elsewhere. Although at night, I'm more likely to rack up my bill with drinks not food so their loss.But if you are looking for a well-crafted meal, this is a good place to check out.",

    "text": "For now, Peculiar Rabbit is only getting 3 stars from me. That is solely because aside from having a small bite of my husband's pretzel, I haven't tried any of their food. Despite not trying their food, I am OBSESSED with a) the view from the roof and b) their perfectly spicy bloody marys. The Peculiar Rabbit is now going to be yet another \"go to\" place when we have out of town guests visiting. It's in a fantastic neighborhood, close to several of our other favorite hangouts, has local beer on tap, and a view of the Charlotte skyline that is unmatched. I haven't been at night yet, so I'm only judging it based on what I experienced at ~2pm on a Sunday afternoon, but I wouldn't mind heading back there next Sunday to soak in some sun and enjoy the views/bloody marys yet again.   My only suggestion, if anyone from Peculiar Rabbit is reading, is to add a few umbrellas or shade structures to the roof. I got absolutely FRIED sitting on the roof for 2 hours, I know I should've worn sunscreen... but I totes would've sat under an umbrella if I had one available.   Other than the sun sensitivity issue, I can find nothing but positive things to say about the Peculiar Rabbit. I hope to try it for dinner and late night soon!",

    "text": "Jackalope Jacks has been contributing to the Elizabeth neighborhood's groove ever since 1994 and its new restaurant concept, The Peculiar Rabbit, will extend that vibe into the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood.  Apparently this bar/restaurant/gastropub has been in the works for years now and renovation and expansion of the old ecclesiastical building feels like it has been going on for a long time, and undeniably it has.    In the 2000s, this used to be the location of the old Steeple Lounge, it may not be immediately apparent to those not from the neighborhood, but this building is not entirely new but rather it is an expansion on an existing building.  Indeed it is unrecognizable.   Ambiance: Strangely, the exterior is similar to the new Cook-Out restaurants that clashes with the contemporary \"Arts & Crafts\" interior.  Despite the clashing aesthetics, the rich woods and dark colors complement one another very well.  This restaurant/bar is three-story's tall with each floor having its own bar.  The main bar is on the first floor and throughout the whole place you can find seating area for eating.  The terrace with spectacular views of downtown Charlotte on the third floor is already very popular and reservations are highly encouraged in order to eat al fresco.  Food & Drink: They have over twenty craft beers (including local) and an array of wines by the glass and bottle. For those who prefer non-alcoholic drinks there are non-alcoholic beers, root beers, sweet teas, juices, and soft drinks.  From experience, one would expect this to be solely a burger place.  Since they just opened, they are offering a limited version of their full menu.  However, they offer more than just the typical \"bar food.\"    The types of dishes you can find are:   *Asian Fusion - such as Bahn Mi, Vietnamese Hoagie *British - such as Fish & Chips & Sheppard's Pie *New American - Burgers galore including vegetarian variations. *Poutine - French-Canadians rejoice, but their version comes with oxtails.  ~Prices in the menu range from $10-$30.  Reasonable, and runs the gamut for different budgets.  If you want to eat a full meal here, you must order before 10:00pm, because after that the Peculiar Rabbit only offers drinks and \"BarBites\" (appetizers) till closing time.  I had the veggie burger and it was very tasty, it was tofu based, with shitake mushrooms, brown rice, rolled oats, and other delectable ingredients.  My experience here was nice and from looking at the enthusiastic crowd tonight, one can deduct this establishment will become a very popular locale in the near future.",

    "text": "The biggest impression The Peculiar Rabbit made was when I was leaving last night. Let me rewind to my dinner last night with a friend to catch up. We had reservations via OpenTable (this venue doesn't give dining points FYI) at 6pm and as the evening was warm preceded to dine on the upstairs patio.   At 6pm the downstairs bar was empty and we proceeded straight up the stairs. The local art on the wall is a good choice for such a prominent neighborhood location. Still it was odd to walk through what used to be a goth dance club to see it all fancy and covered in brightly lit wood. The view is indeed, really, really nice. Our waiter's knowledge of the beer list wasn't comprehensive when I asked him about the type & bitterness of some of the selections but he was able to make a suggestion when I told him the style I preferred. Kudos to them for carrying Breckenridge Brewery's Agave Wheat that I discovered on a recent ski trip. My friend and I were tempted by the PBR PEI's but split the baby back rib sliders with granny smith apple slaw. He ordered the Shepard's Pie I went with the signature Peculiar Rabbit.  I was surprised at how long our appetizer was taking so I believe the kitchen is still figuring out their timing. Indeed the sliders we wanted to share arrived just after  as our main dishes. The fries that accompanies the appetizer looked great but just weren't as crispy as I was expecting but tasted good. The apple slaw on the sliders is really great pairing. I can't speak for my my friend's Shepard Pie as it was gone by the time I looked up to ask. I was engrossed with the peculiar rabbit. The rabbit itself is executed sublimely, with a mild and not overwhelming flavor in the cabernet sauce that envelopes the rabbit meat without overwhelming or hiding it's game meat earthiness. The mashed potatoes the rabbit rests upon are smooth for a rich experience as a dish.  So to recap the food is really good, not outrageous but certainly a price point generally above the rest of the neighborhood but Lulu's, the service/kitchen pacing is mildly underwhelming (and really the only thing holding back a 4th star) but  not impressive and I've already stated the view is great. So let's get to the atmosphere which really was impressed upon me as I left and more people were there.   I can completely see the Peculiar Rabbit becoming the new it place for first or second dates. If you want to impress the first date, spend the money, order dinner and eat on the top level patio. For a more relaxed or mingling evening stay on the second floor & sample multiple dishes from the bar snack menu or drift to the back room for skee ball or bumper pool. To pick up a new upwardly mobile professional friend hang out inside at the first level bar and for a first date cozy up at the tables & heat lamps out front to people watch Snug Harbor or Soul's patrons.",

    "text": "This place is a 3 to 4 stars toss up. First of all I live in the neighborhood, and yet I don't understand the up-in-arms vibes I am feeling with some of these reviews. So here is my honest and fair version after several visits, including the soft opening.   The design of the space is a little odd.  The first impression is that the space is a little tight.  Reason being there are so many oddly divided areas, like the hidden game area behind the stairs where staffs go in and out of kitchen and a separate dining area on the first floor.  The place is an otherwise well decorated, simple, pub-y kinda joint. The service has always been good, though sometimes I think the wait staffs just aren't that knowledgable about the menu. Bartenders were great and are always on their A game.   Beer selection is decent. Lots of local and domestic microbrews. The other night they had $4 pint on any winter seasonal. I think they have drink specials every time I have been here, so complaining about drink prices isn't warranted.   I haven't been back to the rooftop since the soft opening, which was too dark to eat (or see the other persons face for that matter). I don't know if they have fixed it by now.  Frankly I can't truly enjoy any outdoor patio space in Charlotte ever since it becomes smokers' paradise. I may pop back up there when the weather gets nicer.   Food... It is their weakness.  There are always hits and misses.  I have had the mussels and the onion soup on my first visit.  Mussels were a little overcooked in my opinion. The onion soup has always tasted good but it's a very different consistency (it's a cross between creamy and fluffy... Yes, it has a fluff to it). And it's never hot enough for me as a soup. I have had the banh mi in the late night bite menu, which wasn't a bad deal since it comes with a side.  The meat was a bit overly salty that time, but I may give it another try.  The most recent visit I had the Swedish meatballs. It's a typical tapa size, 3 meatballs with mashed rutabaga.  I found the rutabaga to be fabulous but the meatballs were a little tough in textures.  I think if they can step up the game with the food, it will definitely be a 4 stars place.   I do agree that paid parking isn't cool, but I think that even for uptown. They blocking off an area for themselves is no worse than my city which I pay taxes for telling me I cant park on the street and I must pay to park in private parking lot or garage. At least here we still have plenty of free spaces, just have to walk a little further.   I don't know what beef people have with this management, but I truly believe those personal feelings should not be used as \"reviews.\". This place is no more \"out of character\" than Whiskey Warehouse around the corner. At least I always have good services at the Rabbit, can't say that for WW.",

(And you ask because apparently there's always a pretty long wait..) It was hot. And we just sucked it up and endured the heat, and got a nice September tan while we were at it.   I ordered the Chicken Biscuit, and the Lady ordered a salad. The chicken salad was spectacular, topped with hot sauce, a big cheddar biscuit, fantastically flavored fried chicken, cheddar, and scallions. Really filling, really wonderful.   The rooftop itself was an awesome space. There was a fantastic view of the city, and of most of Plaza. I definitely want to come back for regular service dinner, and hopefully they'll get an updated 5 star!",

They ran out of spinach artichoke dip and he recommended we try the Queen City poutine, which was AMAZING. He also gave it to us on the house since they didn't have what we wanted initially and that further justifies the five stars. My husband and I both ordered the classic burger and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I loved it because you can actually taste the good quality beef instead of overbearing seasonings. It's a very hipster scene and the inside felt a bit loud for my taste (perfect for my 20's, not so much for my 30's). All in all, good atmosphere, great food, and amazing service.",

Then someone accidentally dropped a glass and although it was loud no one even came to the table to assist in cleaning up the glass. So, after using all of our napkins we had to ask for a towel from the bar to finishing cleaning it up.... still no one checked on the table and no, no one asked if we would like to replace the drink.

The drink was ok i wasnt too crazy about it. My friend ordered some type of pork loin which looked really good i dont eat pork so i didn't indulge it was drenched in some type of delicious looking mushroom sauce i would  definetly come back here again i need to find a drink that i actually love there.

    "text": "The view from the rooftop can't be beat. Beautiful view of the city.   The menu is very small. It felt more like a bar menu than a full service restaurant menu. Everything we ordered was tasty. I enjoyed the watermelon salad, and my burger was  juicy and cooked to order. I also sampled the mussels and the chicken (from the chicken and waffles). Both also good.   Unfortunately our service was poor and very inconsistent. We had young children with us, so we ordered their meals when we ordered our first round of drinks. Long story short, the kid's meals arrived AFTER all of our other food (appetizers then entrees). It was difficult to get staff attention, so getting basic items like silverware, even after there was food on the table) was a chore.   Too bad.",

    "text": "Went for brunch and what a hot mess this place is.  -Waited 30 mins for a table when there were more than a dozen tables empty.  -waited an hour for our food.  -one of the three dishes came out cold and soggy and incorrect -we asked the manager if we could have a redo on the soggy meal (a quick easy dish, the avocado toast.) he was defensive saying \"well, everyone's been waiting for their food, everyone decided to show up all at once today.)  -the redo meal came back incorrect with two ingredients missing.   I was so hangry, I gave up and ate it as is and left to forget the terrible brunch experience.   To management: your kitchen is doing a new brunch menu? Great. Do more testing and polishing before launching. Train your staff better.  We were served chicken and waffles with no syrup, biscuits with no butter, food with no utensils. We had to ask for EVERYTHING. Also my avocado toast was disgusting. Store-bought preserved gross guac, not fresh avocado? Yuck.  To the manager, Kyle: don't ever tell clients bad service and wrong orders is the norm because you got slammed. That's not our fault. Send over a round of drinks. Apologize. Act like you care, even if you're stressed.   Bright spots: The server was delightful and tried so hard to make up for the abhorrent food service. Good views. A nice roofdeck.   Such a shame this place isn't better.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here on Sunday, simply because we had a $5 off coupon. In the end, the food was an A-ok experience. However, our waitress was absolutely incredible. I really should have gotten her name!   We got here right at 12 (who would arrive before 12 for brunch on a Sundays anyways.....dumb alcohol laws in NC....brunch without mimosas is just a no in my book!). I ordered a double mimosa. It was good. Not completely sure if it was $8 good. However, it was a nice pour. My husband got the Bloody Mary. It came with all these things attached to the skewer, which is just so fun! I think it was like shrimp, an egg, okra, another shrimp.   The waitress brought out some fresh made scones to start off with. They were absolutely delish. Apparently, the chef makes a batch of scones every Sunday and they basically pass them out for free until they run out. Today's batch was a blackberry lemonade scone. Probably the best part of the meal. The early bird gets the scone is what our waitress said!  For our meal, we ordered the corn fritters and then decided to split the shroom and spinach omelette with grits. The corn fritters came out suuuuuper hot. They were just alright. Nothing completely amazing. The aioli with it was a nice additive though. The omelette was pretty good. There was alot of mushrooms in it, which was great. I wasnt a huge fan of the cheese used....maybe it was swiss. Not completely sure but I think it took a way a bit from the flavor. The cheesy grits were A-mazing though!! I believe my exact quote to my husband was that I was contemplating licking the bowl. Since we split the dish, I had to give up half the grits and that was a very hard thing to do!   Pretty good experience but the waitress was just on it the entire brunch meal. She was super personable and made our experience there!",

    "text": "Brunch/Breakfast was good and priced well. Why are the coffee cups so small?  I met friends here for brunch one lazy Saturday and we had to wait about 20 minutes or so for a table, we sat at the bar and since it was almost noon, had a cocktail - they have a good specliaty list. The drink was good.  Once seated we placed an order for each of us (eggs, bacon etc) and then some french toast for the table, since all of us wanted to try that.   My impressions:  1) Coffee cups are too small. If you are going to have coffee mugs that small, leave a carafe at the table, so we can re-pour. The coffee itself was really good quality though. I wonder if the small cups are to slow us down on drinking it all.  2) Service is very slow, but not unpleasant. They just seemed a bit confused sometimes.  3) All the food was well prepared and tasty.  4) Good ambience and cute set up.  They have a killer view of Uptown - and the roof top bar is the best.  I do have to mention that the server forgot to put in our french toast order till much later and so we had to wait for it, it didn't come out with the other items as requested.",

    "text": "My original spot that my brother took my family was Soul. But since they didnt have indoor seating, because it was full, and there was a 30 minute wait time on a Sunday (they had outdoor seating, but it was too cold)... We came here. I'm glad that I had the chance to check out this place.  Located on the corner of two streets, it gives a feeling of it being up to dated and almost, dare I say \"city like\" feel? Hm, I guess that's what I was thinking when I walked in.  Inside, you'll find a nice open area and two floors. They have a full bar, my favorite place because you can see what they have on tap, and plenty of seating. Our waiter was Matt, and was a good one too (even though he sometimes forgot what we asked...I'll give him a break though.)  So lets get to the goodies. For appetizers we got devils on horseback. Not bad. The only problem I feel like this dish had was that it was loaded with cream cheese. I'm not in particular about it or fanatic, but it wasn't too bad.  Second appetizer was the fried pickles. I would also like to mention that they have fried okra mixed in there. These weren't bad, but nothing really amazing to compliment either.  Just fried pickles, okra, and some ranch dip.  The third appetizer was the Korean BBQ skewers. Now these, they're just lacking some flavor. I can see the potential of this, but also the portion I felt was a little too small and lacked the BBQ taste. I wish they would have just a little more taste and that would have made the difference for me.   The entree: I got the pasta and provisions pappardelle. You know that excitement feeling from reading the dish and then after tasting it, you have that \"that hit the spot\" feeling? Well, sadly I didn't get it this time. Yes, I finished my dish, but the aftermath of the dish was just okay. I don't know what it was about though because to me when I ate the pasta it was either too wet (I know theres cream with it, but it wasn't that type of wet) or too thick. The texture in my mouth felt as if I was eating something mushy.   Yet, more notably...the flavor of the cream sauce was good. So it was like eating flavorful mush!  (On the side note, my mother got the Shepard's Pie. This dish is great, I suggest it over what I got.)  Overall, this place I'm just going to give 3 stars. Some dishes lacked flavor and the price of the food I thought was a little pricey, but not too expensive. I would pay any price for some amazing flavor! Hey, at least I didn't have to sit in the cold for food.",

Turnover was less than perfect; we had to ask for water a second time.  Then, we had to prompt our waitress a second time to get another round of drinks. IMHO, they were understaffed.  The pork belly was charred.  Barely edible.  But we'd already waited so long...  Mashed potatoes were tepid, not much more than body temperature.  The cioppino was flavorful, but overcooked.  The shrimp were rubbery.  The fish, mush.  The second floor was so loud, we could barely hear each other or the waitress.  The beer and wine selection were a plus, but getting a last minute reservation through OpenTable was the highlight of our visit.",

    "text": "I've actually never written a review before but my experience at The Peculiar Rabbit motivated me.   Positives: Great space, two levels, beautiful interior.  Nice beer selection and the service was good.  My wife and I split a calamari appetizer which was nicely done and a nice portion for the price. Negatives: I ordered the Guiness beef stew and it was terrible.  I can't recall sending a dish back (unless its obviously under cooked, etc.) but last night I couldn't justify paying for this dish.  For around 15 dollars (can't recall the exact price) I was given a dish with one piece of beef in it and several spoon fulls of vegetables. Also, it was listed a Guiness beef stew and the broth tasted of canned beef broth.  The actually serving dish itself was quite large but the amount of food in it was equivalent to what you would expect in a appetizer size or bowl size of stew and mostly watery broth.   I sent the stew back and told the waiter that I wasn't interested in anything else.  After having sent something back you would expect a visit from the manager but we didn't receive one. I was not looking to complain but more wanted to give my honest opinion.  You would think they would want to hear the reason for it being sent back so it could be improved upon.     My wife ordered the mushroom risotto arancini which was tasty but was a little dry.  Not sure if it was made to order. We did order dessert (we had a groupon and wanted to get our money's worth) and got the apple gallette.  Again, very dry and did not seem fresh at all.  The dessert was barely warmed and filled with mostly raisins.   Again, it was a very cool spot and would consider going for drinks and maybe an appetizer but would definitely not consider eating there again.  They don't seem to be suffering at all, it was packed on a Tuesday, but they definitely need to work on their food.  The price is not worth the quality at all.",

    "text": "The food here is ok-brunch is probably the best serving they have. The problem with brunch is that each of the four times I have visited this place , the employees always look high, drunk, hungover or a combo. The coffee cups were served on app plates-not saucers-and therefore the cups were sliding around. Again, getting refills on coffee were like asking for blood from a stone---are employees incentivized on saving coffee? It is also a pet peeve to have my check brought before we are done eating-especially on a Sunday brunch. This wasn't the mid week lunch, it was brunch and before noon , so clearly not a big rush to turn a table. It does have a great view of the skyline---just don't expect too much else out of your visit.",

There were 5 of us and they were out of the first 4 wine choices and the one recommended was not tasty at all.  We went to a higher priced bottle that was fine and they DID take the first bottle off the menu and apologize profusely.  They have also changed their menu to more mainstream items, and the roof top was closed.  I won't be going for a while and my Southpark friends will stay close to home!",

I really wish I could give it a 5, but unfortunately I have never been served a dish at the appropriate temperature.  It's always been lukewarm in the dozen+ times I've been there.  I've decided in the future I will be requesting my food HOT and hope to receive it as such.  The Saturday special was amazing! It was a crispy duck with mushrooms and bok choy that was amazing in flavor, but lacking in temperature,   I can only imagine the potential of the deliciously balanced flavors and textures to be stellar if served when hot.    Everything is great!  I especially recommend the rancheros for brunch as well as the bahn mi, lamb burger, and the mussels.  The only thing I've had that I wouldn't recommend would be the fried green tomatoes.  They were very underwhelming.    Overall, a great restauarant! Just remember to order your food hot!",

The first time we were already in the area. We got to the restaurant around 3pm and was told the kitchen is not open right now and that it would be open in an hour. Cool! We said we would try later in the week. So we did just that. Tried to call when they said they opened so I don't drive all the way there and be told the kitchen was closed again. Never got an answer. The mailbox was even full so that tells me everything I need to know about the management at least. So got there and of course doors locked. Other patrons were also attempting to get in and were surprised they were closed. They definitely need to get organized. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "I should give them a 2nd star for location and rooftop, but as a bar, this place is beyond pathetic and I don't want to steer away from that narrative.  I will say that I did see a couple servers working hard, especially the one having to work the rooftop.  I came here on the 3rd of July thinking it might be a decent place to watch fireworks.  I didn't realize they didn't have a rooftop bar on weekdays, so I ended up walking back down a floor to the 3rd story bar.  I don't know if it was this girls first day behind a bar or she was having a breakdown or what.  I asked for a Higher Ground, they said they were out(I later found out they had plenty, they were just too lazy to change out kegs).  I then asked what other IPAs they had and she said she didn't know.  I just pointed at Goose Island and took it.  The next time I walked down to her she was saying how she couldn't open a bottle of prosecco without a wine key.....  I think she might have been dumb.....  I heard her later say that they had kegs, they were just too busy to change them.  But the place wasn't busy, which was strange.  And at least one of the servers was making her own drinks down there to save herself time.  I decided to go to the first floor bar for the next round.  Multiple people behind the bar, none of which could serve beers for some reason.  Yet again, no higher ground, so I went to liquor.  I ordered something easy Jim Beam and Ginger, just to get a drink.  Guy pours it, doesn't know how much it is.  Didn't feel like waiting for the total, so I just threw him a $20.  It was sad honestly.  Like, if it was their first day open I'd still say it was sad.",

The huevos rotos was a bit more satisfying with a plethora of spices and kicks but it was a bit spicy. However I'd like to note that the beer selection and service was pretty great. Parking is a bit strange as well.  Overall, pretty good food but a bit too pricy for what we got.  Taste - 3.5/5 Atmosphere - 3/5 Value - 2/5",

I was starving but only ate half.  The roasted potatoes were pretty good, but it might be because my sandwich wasn't?!  My friend got eggs Benedict and didn't like it either.  Can I be honest though... we didn't care that much.  The drinks and service was really good.  This is a place you go to for the view.  The upstairs patio is awesome.

I was also impressed with the chorizo sweet potato tot things that I got as a side with the burger. I sat on the roof where there is a great view of the Charlotte skyline.   Service was fast other than it taking quite a while to get our check. I'll have to go back during a peak time and see if the service is any different. For those that don't know, this restaurant is four floors and I could imagine service could be slow if they were busy and they didn't have enough staff.  I probably wouldn't dine here unless there was seating on the roof available. However, not a bad place to drop in to have a beer due to the vast beer selection.",

The chicken and waffles were definitely solid.  Not the absolute best I've had, but definitely noteworthy.  Chicken was juicy, not dry, you got a decent portion.  Honestly, the chicken/waffles were probably great, but were easily outshined by the amazing brussel sprouts.  They were marinated with some sort of balsamic dressing and cooked perfectly.  The texture was just right.  Overall, this place is probably best suited for a quick bite and brew with the football game, boasts a good beer list, and solid eats!",

We would have been fine waiting until our designated time, but they kindly whisked us upstairs to the roof to a reserved table. It was a beautiful night with a little breeze, and it was really nice to look at the Uptown skyline from our seats.  Our server explained that the restaurant was just introducing a new menu, and asked us to bear with them as everything on the menu was new. We need not have worried, though, because the food was served quickly and everything was out of this world. Our server was also very helpful in answering our questions (such as how many plates should we order for two people to split, what's the deal with the poutines, etc.).  We ordered The Queen City poutine, which is apparently a staple on the menu (so one of the only items that wasn't new that night). I don't remember everything that was on it, but I do know it involved queso and short ribs. SO GOOD. All the other poutines looked amazing, as well. We also split the avocado fried, with green goddess dipping sauce, which were amazing.   Our third and last plate was the corn dogs. While hesitant about ordering something so odd, my husband persuaded me. The corn dogs were maple breakfast sausages rolled in a blueberry waffle batter and fried. They were served with a blueberry maple dipping sauce. Sounds odd. WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. They were awesomely greasy, like a funnel cake, without being dripping with oil. The sausages were large and flavorful. The sauce made it all the better. These are such a cool and special addition to the menu. I highly recommend them!  All in all, I would go back in a heartbeat.",

We asked for the appetizer first, everything came out at the same time and none of it was warm. All the food came out room temperature. Our table was dirty, I cleaned it myself but it was still sticky. The table next to us has old food sitting on it the entire time we were there. They weren't even that busy, probably like 15 customers in there! There was cleaner sitting on the table in front of us for a long time, not sure if that's a health code violation but I wish it had been used for my table. I had high hopes but was disappointed. Probably won't go back.",

    "text": "After walking by several times, I am finally convinced that the reason you'd come here is for the view and not much else. The Peculiar Rabbit has an awesome location in Plaza Midwood but beyond that nothing drew me into to love this establishment.   My sister was here from out of town, and we decided to get brunch. With $16 for an unlimited buffet, it sounded like a great pick. My sister and my fiance, opted for the buffet and we're a little disappointed. When getting the buffet option, you can order eggs, bacon or sausage with your waiter and they will bring them out for you. Unlimited buffet, but with limited options. Almost everything had meat in it for us vegetarians (minus the bread options, which I don't need to carbo load) and they did make a strong effort to have offerings of cheese grits, scalloped potatoes and a vegetarian gravy for biscuits, but this gravy is made with mushrooms and I am not the biggest fan of mushrooms.   With my options being limited, I went off the menu and ordered the crab cake eggs benedict with the hollandaise on the side. Solid choice, a little salty, but I can manage. One thing I thought was strange was the side salad. This little salad consisted of 3 greens and no dressing or anything else. Why was it even on the plate?   As a non-beer drinker, living in North Carolina is hard. A lot of restaurants or bars only offer one cider on draft. When I saw The Peculiar Rabbit had Strongbow on draft, I jumped at the opportunity. Well, the waiter came back and informed me it was flavored: cherry or orange. I've never heard of flavored Strongbow but went with the cherry. Naturally, they didn't have it, so I got the orange. Now, let's revisit, this was on draft, but it came in a bottle. It's listed on both menus as a draft so unsure why it came like this and I had mentioned that to our waiter as well. Be warned that if you're looking for a cider this is not the place to come. I wonder if there is a Strongbow on tap and the server just didn't know.   Awesome outdoor seating, and yes, it's dog-friendly.",

The food is outright bad. The menu makes no sense. It is highly overpriced for what you actually get.   The service follows suit with quite an unmotivated staff. Good luck actually trying to place your order or get a drink refilled.   We even attempted to just do drinks one night to see if the place had changed after all the bad experiences.  Can't mess up just-drinks, right? Sadly my beer was undrinkable as clearly a sour or ipa keg kicked so they switched it out to a stout without cleaning the lines or something. Couldn't even finish the beer nor could I find our server to pay the tab. The rest of the employees were clearly ducking/hiding in an attempt to not help any customers. So we just left cash and rolled out.  Such a waste of space in Plaza-Midwood.",

I know that happens in almost any restaurant, but the kitchen shouldn't make it obvious  The Rabbit has gone downhill. The new menu is boring, and the food is sub-standard. Does management think most customers won't notice? Well, that's their gamble, isn't it?",

Our server was really nice and attentive as well.

We really did enjoyed their charcuterries plate though, wished they gave us more because we all really loved it!  Our drinks were ok as well. We had the peach sangria and it was alright.

If I rated just on the quality of food and price of food, I'd say it might earn 3 or maybe even 4 stars, based on what was ordered.  Certainly everyone in the party wasn't \"wowed\" by what they ordered; one said \"great\", but the rest reported an \"eh-ok\".  The service was poor.  The waitress seemed like she was doing us a huge favor by serving us.  Two of the beers she delivered were not what was ordered.  Oh, and when we sat down and four people wanted to scan the tap beer menu (there was one menu and four beer people), I asked for another copy and was told  \"no, we don't have another copy.\"  What?!? (we got up and grabbed one from another table).  Never came-by to ask how things were going (always had to flag her down).  Delivered a greasy, nearly empty ketchup container that we had to ask for (yeah, and we had fries).  There were other annoyances like that throughout.",

    "text": "After hearing through the grapevine and keeping tabs on construction for this establishment, we were surprised and delighted to hear that The Peculiar Rabbit was holding a soft open this past week. Had heard that it was going to be \"Jack's Across the Tracks\" and a few other rumors that made no sense. After seeing another gastro-pub open in town, the time was ripe to check it out! Here's my take:  The exterior and general aesthetic doesn't exactly scream gastro-pub. It has taken an odd shape with some serious standout qualities. My favorite part is the giant logo literally stamped on the side of the building. Definitely makes a statement.   The interior is very chic and a little more trendy than I anticipated. Wasn't expecting to see such a heavy bar scene. Long bar on the 1st and 2nd floors that I'm pretty sure mimic one another to a T. When it comes to a night out in Plaza, beer is always on the menu. I was pretty disappointed with the beer selection. The draught brews consisted of some NC beers, but only Copper from Olde Meck. Think it'd be nice to get some of the other local breweries on board as well. The bottle selection is decent. Had a chance to order a New Castle brew I had never had.  The menu was a bit limited due to the soft open. We stared with the twice-baked potatoes and pretzels. First, the twice-baked were pretty bland. The creme fraiche was very well executed, but the rest of the dish was forgettable. With only three tiny potatoes, I wouldn't look to order this again. The pretzels....divine. The presentation was great and the portions, hefty two-bite sized pieces, were perfectly crunchy on the exterior and chewy on the inside. The beer cheese, which seems to be rather popular as of late, is splendid. Great texture and subtle flavor. Also came with spicy stone-ground mustard.  We decided to split an entree. Went with Banh Mi. My goodness. Talk about divine. The pork was so flavorful and was reminiscent of some other great Banh Mi I've had. The veggies were fresh and complemented well. The bread, sourced local, was a nice touch. Very good stand up for that juicy which.   The views are absolutely stunning. It was an absolutely gorgeous night and the skyline couldn't have been set more perfectly. The roof deck is by far one of the most impressive in town. I'm looking forward to dining there next time!   One of the most admirable aspects is the farm-to-table practice. Great to see the menu littered with local sources and our server had a great knowledge of where specific items had come from. A rather important trait for a biz to have these days to stay on the radar of Charlotte's culinary-minded.   One thing we couldn't really handle was the noise level. We were sitting across from one another and yelling to hear each others' words. Wonder if there would be an option for sound dampening on the 2nd floor? Also, the natural light that comes in with the sunset was blinding. Curtains will definitely be a must in the coming weeks.   My biggest critique is the parking situation. Goodness gracious. Everywhere you can park around the building is permanently taken and other parking spaces around that part of plaza are marked with what seems like \"PARK HERE AND DIE\" types of signs. If they can work something out with local parking spaces after regular biz hours for surrounding businesses or look into comped valet perhaps, it would serve them well.   I think TPR has some serious potential with that space. Their menu and beer list will definitely see some tweaking and I look forward to the result. Like many new places, there will be many changes made for flow, better service, and overall experience. I'm definitely a fan and the service and experience given to us will have us coming back in the near future. The views alone from the roof will keep us coming back on cool, clear nights!  Glad we had a chance to sample this joint so early! Welcome to the neighborhood!  Cheers.",

While I won't say it was the best mimosa I have ever had as the bubbly was a bit too sweet, I can't argue with that price.   My friend and I split two dishes, a potato tart and the veggie burger. The tart was the better option and was served with perfectly seasoned asparagus, it was tasty. The veggie burger wasn't good. It tasted grossly sweet and had and oat-like texture I didn't get any  chick pea flavor/texture as in the description. The saving grace was It was paired with really delicious fries and the brioche bread was tasty.   The prices seemed much more reasonable this time around and my meal with mimosa came to $15. Our service was leaps and bounds above the last and we also had a server-in-training who did a nice job (he had a good teacher).   I still think they have room for growth but I was much happier this time around...",

(Cocktails were 1/2 price, got The Painkiller for $5, it was delicious) After finishing those, it was about 15 minutes before he stopped talking to the hostess and I flagged him down to order another round... Took almost 10 minutes to get those drinks...Please keep in mind there are 2 people at the bar and only 4 other sat tables around us. This pattern continued throughout our meal :-l  In terms of our food, the beer pretzels were good, but came out with cheese after I asked for mustard (explained to server that I can't eat dairy). Easily fixable, it happens, but just annoying at this point. My boyfriend's grilled cheese (I think it came with shredded beef?) was mostly bread and cheese with barely any meat... My $9 kale salad came out with barely any toppings or dressing..the lamest salad...see picture.  So annoyed at this point that we asked for boxes right away (didn't feel like going through the hassle of sending the food back and waiting another hour)  Since we knew we'd be waiting- and I wasn't driving : ) - I went to the bar and ordered 2 shots of tequila, for $22.....Thrilled at this point.   It sucks when you finally go out for date night and just get terrible service and sad portions, especially when my boyfriend spent over $100 and barely got to enjoy our time spent (which was much longer than we wanted to be there but everything just took so long!) Everyone's food pics look amazing and the atmosphere is great, it was just such a frustrating/disappointing experience :-l rant over",

I'm a rib lover, and these just didn't hit the mark. Everything else was delicious!! The Risotto had amazing flavor, they do a great job at keeping the traditional Chicken & Waffles yummy and savory, and the Crab Cake sandwich had a great sauce and I love a good gourmet bun! The service was ordinary the second time but great the first time and the drink specials are good. I will definitely be back, and I hope I can make it in for a ladies night out sometime too!",

    "text": "After visiting The Peculiar Rabbit 3 times over the course of 3 months, I can only give this place 3 stars. The first time we visited, it had only been open for a few weeks, and since we live in the neighborhood, we wanted to wait a bit for the hype to die down as well as the kinks worked out.  We sat at the bar on the first floor (the second floor was being rented out, as was the patio downstairs) for dinner our first visit. It was a week night and fairly quiet. The bartender was great, and served us quickly. The beer list was pretty good, and I always love seeing NC beers on draft! We ordered the Pretzels with Rarebit dip & whole grain mustard while we perused the menu. The pretzels were super buttery (almost too rich), and the rarebit dip was a little mild. The mustard was great, but since it was whole grain, it was hard to get it on the pretzel (picky, I know). However, it was a good start! We then ordered the Lebanese Lollipop and the Banh Mi with fries to split. The Lollipop was excellent. The hummus and the flatbread were really yummy, and the salsa fresca served with it was refreshing. The lamb was really flavorful, and I would definitely recommend it! The Banh Mi threw me off. First, the pork was in patty form (ground with spices) and in a flat oval shape. The menu said  \"ground pork meatball\" but we didn't expect it to be flat! The texture was really weird. Also, there were fresh jalapenos, which made it too spicy! The house made roll was really good, and the other accoutrement (pickled daikon & carrot) were good. The fries are really really good here, but the sandwich is something I wouldn't order again.  The second time we came here, it was just for drinks on a Friday night. We were happy that the bar wasn't being rented out upstairs, as it would have been packed! There were 8 of us and we floated around the second floor, listening to music and playing some of the fun games. We also went upstairs to the outside bar (which has some lighting and heat blowers). There were 3 groups that had taken up the 3 working heaters so we couldn't be up there too long. The service was good, and if we had stayed longer, I know it would have been a wild night!  The third time we visited was on Friday. We didn't have a reservation (oops), and we showed up with 8 people at 7:15. The 2nd floor was being rented out (again, a common theme it seems) so space was very limited. This was originally intended to be a casual, sit-at-the-bar kind of gathering but the bar downstairs was packed and the hostesses said there were 3 big parties expected at 7:30 and it was worth waiting for if they didn't show. So we waited around the bar area (getting jostled every 2 minutes, it was definitely too crowded) and miraculously they made a table of 6 work for our group of 8. The hostesses were rock stars! I ordered the Burger (fried egg, bacon, Mornay sauce) with those irresistible fries. It came out perfectly medium rare which is nice to get in Charlotte. I was not thrilled with my burger, which should have been a knock out dish. The Mornay sauce was an unnecessary addition as it was very bland. The sauce just really drowned out/dulled all the other flavors! My fiance ordered the Fish & Chips, which were excellent. Other people ordered the Tofu Burger (the only vegetarian in the crowd and it was NOT good), the Ribs (came highly recommended), and the Banh Mi with a side of sweet potato & bean soup, which was apparently delicious.  Service was OK, but I know they were busy so I'm not going to knock them for that.  All in all, I haven't been wowed by everything on the menu...it seems really hit-or-miss. I definitely want to get the Oxtail Poutine and the Mussels next time, though! I will definitely come back in another month or two and keep working my way through the menu because I really DO want to love this place. I think the concept is great and the service is pretty good. I hope they keep working the kinks out!",

While our server was great, we were particularly impressed by the Maitre'd, Nicole. She honestly made our visit as pleasant as it was due to her professional demeanor and pleasant nature. We had come on a whim, you see, and hoped for rooftop seating which, sadly, was not immediately available. However, Nicole went out of her way to show us to the various different bars and dining rooms (and even told us about some of her favorite cocktails!) we could wait in while a table come available. As impatient as my friend can often be when it comes to eating (and practically everything else!) I genuinely appreciated the care and time given to us.",

At first they looked at me like I was insane why would you eat those two together especially for dinner? They loved it! Our server was Justin and we he was great! He was fast getting our drinks and apps out even though it was very busy, we didn't have to wait too long. He also convinced us that we had to get a dessert to celebrate my family in town, so we did and that was also amazing.

We ordered the stuffed figs and lamb kofka skewers over fava bean hummus. The figs were good, but the sauce was too sweet and seemed to dominate the other flavors. Kofka skewers were delicious. The hummus was some of the best I've had in a restaurant. Best part of this place was the roof, the view is killer, and it is nicely decorated.

    "text": "I was SO looking forward to this place because I heard it was delicious.  My boyfriend and I had been traveling a lot and hadn't been on a date in a long time and were VERY excited to try this place.  We made a reservation for 8pm and arrived promptly, but really wanted to sit outside on the upstairs patio so we agreed to wait an hour.  When the hostess got us an hour later, she took us to a table on the ground floor, I explained that we were waiting for a table upstairs.  She snapped \"Well there are none\" and left us to sit outside.  20 minutes or so later a server finally brought us some water (9:20pm) and took our order.  We ordered the calamari salad, bacon wrapped figs, and a duck entree.  More than 30 MINUTES later (9:50) the figs arrived, and you could tell by the heat level and texture that it had been sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long.  The calamari salad came around 10:00 and was horrible and bland.  It is a cold salad...there is no reason it should take 40 minutes to come out.  The entree arrived at 10:20 (nearly an hour and a half after we sat down) and was absolutely terrible.  The duck was greasy yet dry at the same time and had clearly been under the heat lamp for some time.  It was so bad that we ended up ordering a second dinner at the movies later!!  We advised our server around 9:30 that we needed to be gone by 10:15 to make a movie.  He was the one saving grace of the meal.  He was very apologetic about the wait and did take a beer and our entree off the bill.  I know it wasn't his fault...the kitchen was clearly backed up, but it was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Charlotte.    Whoever is the manager needs to take a serious look at the staffing of the kitchen and the flow, especially on busy warm weekend nights.  We will definitely not be returning, unless for drinks only, which is a shame because it is a great location and the menu looked promising.",

Charging for parking in a lot that's used by all local bars and then offering a $5 drink if you pay means they're just trying to steal all business from the other local restaurants/bars. Oh by the way, you have to spend $50 to get that $5 drink. What?? It's disrespectful and it makes many people not want to go to this establishment. They should know better in a neighborhood like Plaza Midwood.",

Our waitress was awful, she was more concerned with hanging out with her friends at the table next to us.  We had to wait for over an hour for our food, and even the food was awful!

I walked upstairs to meet a friend at the bar and I swear it felt like it had the feel of an empty Applebee's. The music was also just pure insanity. If someone told me to come up with a mix of the crappiest songs from the fifties and the late eighties; I wouldn't have come close to the poor selection they offered. After about twenty minutes of joking about it; they changed it to something bearable. Even though the beer selection was worse than the Citgo down the street; the service was actually decent. Gotta hand it to them- they were making the best out of a pretty bad situation. Not sure how this one gets turned around but someone let me know if that miracle happens and I'll give it another shot.",

Myself, my boyfriend, and our friend walked in about 10:00 PM at night on Saturday and were greeted by the hostess, who asked if we were dining in.  We said no, we were meeting some other friends who had texted us that they were upstairs.  We asked if there was another bar on the upper level and she said yes, then looked up at the telvision above her head with camera views of the different areas of the restuarant/bar and said \"It's very crowded up there.\"  Well, it's Saturday night and we want to be apart of the crowd!  Strange that they have the camera views visible.  We got a drink at the 1st floor bar and the vodka/cranberry that I ordered seemed heavy on ice and not on liquid.  We ended up meeting my three friends on the 2nd level, where yes, it was crowded, but fun crowded, not shoulder-to-shoulder crowded.  They were at a table in the corner, drinking.  We were planning to order a few more rounds before heading to Thomas Street Tavern and were enjoying a nice few minutes of conversation when the server comes to our table and asks if we're ordering food or just drinks.  We tell her we're ordering drinks.  Two minutes later the hostess from downstairs walks up to our table and tells us that she's sorry, but since we're not ordering food, we have to leave the table.  It was as polite as possible, but still, I looked around and saw no one else at the tables surrounding us having food on them.  We were still going to be ordering items, just alcoholic ones.  We debated ordering an appetizer, but were put off by the whole scenerio.  What made it even worse was that when we walked downstairs, there were plenty of tables available for people who want a meal at 10:30 PM on a Saturday night.  Really, Rabbit....very Peculiar indeed.    Needless to say, will NOT be going back anytime soon.",

Firstly the menu for lunch is very limited, I also took my kids- no children's menu. I am aware that it's a \"sports bar\" but when you are in this neighborhood, during lunch you should really consider catering to families. They were completely empty and it still took 45 minutes to get our food. The portions were small (which I like) but the prices are a bit high for  food that is just ok . The server was nice, and attentive but we were the only table seated. I will stick to the places I know in the neighborhood, the tried and True standbys.",

    "text": "I post reviews under two circumstances; a place is REALLY good, or a place is REALLY bad...and the former certainly applies to The Peculiar Rabbit.  First, I am not all that familiar with Plaza Midwood or the surrounding neighboorhood, but the location felt hip and trendy without being too young or too old.  The atmosphere downstairs was great; I did not see the bar or view upstairs.  I ordered the Bibb Salad, which was excellent.  Portion size was great, ingredients were fresh and expertly prepared (especially the walnuts).  For dinner, I had the Wild Mushroom Risotto; I'm not vegeterian, and rarely order pasta at restaurants, but the description sounded great, so I went for it.  WOW.  WOW WOW WOW.  Seriously, maybe the best risotto I've ever had.  Risotto is really easy to screw up, and those I've had at restaurants in CLT are average, but this literally blew me away.  I don't know how you make mushrooms and rice taste like that, but it was just so damn good.  WOW.  For dessert, I shared the fried ice cream...which is bacon ice cream.  Yup, bacon, in the ice cream.  Ice cream...with bacon.  I don't think I need to say more than that.  It was awesome.  Wine list was nice too; fair prices for healthy pours.  The Argentinian Malbec was very good.  Having read other reviews of this place, I'm perplexed. I think the folks who gave it 1-3 starts are delusional.  Granted, I had one meal there, but I'm super critical of restaurants, and I couldn't find a flaw.  I can't wait to go back.",

I have watched this place with great anticipation for months, wondering what, when and how ..... last night saw that they might be open, called to confirm and stopped in after dinner elsewhere.   My observations echo many of the preliminary impressions. Considering the size of the exterior I had an assumption of what the interior might be... Unfortunately you know that old cliche about assumptions.......  We walked up to the door and there were 2 people chatting  sort of said \"hi \" ....were they customers, employees, door people, friendly loiterers ?? not sure.  A few steps in get to the hostess stand, 3 girls behind podium, no recognition as they decipher seating charts like they were cryptic treasure maps. The downstairs was 60ish % full ... but were told there was a long wait on all floors ! hmmmm  We decided to check out the space, from the  outside I expected a spacious inside. I was wrong. Very choppy, small staircases that serve both customers and waitstaff carrying food / drink, and low feeling ceilings.  On the second floor there were many (many) open tables, I asked if I could grab one and was told I had to go back downstairs..... hmmm .... we continued the journey up the tight stairs to the \"rooftop deck\"    Shauna is exactly correct the deck is DARK... it feels like they are going for a \"Miami Lounge\" feel, if so it doesn't work, it is also much smaller than it appears.  We looked around and noticed no bar, hmmm,  a group after us said out loud \"what no bar ?\" ......   We head downstairs and I notice a backroom with a sign that says \"Snooker\" ... think to myself \"cool ... Snooker in Charlotte, maybe some redemption for this place\" ....  walk in the room and WTF pops in my head, as I flash back to being 12 years old ..... Bumper Pool maybe fun ? but it is Not Snooker !!!!  As we walk out there is a guy at the door who smiles and says thanks while drinking red bull..... We head over to W.W.   In Summary... the menu looks good, but not sure... very dis-functional design inexperienced and untrained staff  I will watch the reviews and give them several months before I go back.....",

Right before we left it was switched over to a much more eclectic mix, so there's no excuse to play 80's music, ever. (rant)  Service was prompt, efficient and friendly.

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about The Peculiar Rabbit.  I came here for the first time with a Amazon Local coupon, woohoo! This neighborhood is my jam and I was itching to try the place out. Unfortunately, I didn't have the greatest experience.  The vibe of the interior is nice. Kinda dark and pub-like, but clean and distinguished too. We sat on the second level.   The worst part of our visit was the service. Our waitress was just horrible. She wasn't mean per say, just a total airhead that kept us waiting forever on drinks, food, our check, refills. You name it, she botched it. She even messed up our coupon. She told us we had $5 left, so we ordered dessert, but she didn't add the dessert to the coupon, just gave us a bill for it... wtf? And when she was refilling everyone else's water, I slid my over for a top off... but she totally ignored it and sauntered away.   Another thing that bothered me was all the unnecessary frou frou labeling on the menu. This is a bar, not an elite restaurant. We had to ask endless questions about everything, which was annoying for our server and ourselves.  Also, the prices on our check were higher than what was on the menu! That's a no no! Come on!  We split the OMG Pretzels as an appetizer. They were okay, but nothing special. A little too crunchy and the sauce a little boring and stingy on the portion.  My mom ordered the Classic Burger and was happy. It was simple and she enjoyed it.  My friend and I split The Veggie Burger and The Pub Grilled Cheese. The quality of both of the ingredients in these both was really great. The Veggie Burger was hearty and filling, but the flavor was bland and boring. It needed some sort of zing to step it up. The Grilled Cheese was really good. Thick crusty sourdough bread, gooey cheeses, and tomatoes (which were pretentiously called \"tomato confit\"). I would definitely order it again. As my side I ordered The Ginger-Butternut Squash Bisque.... SO YUMMY. This was my favorite thing I tried. Rich and thick but a rather small portion.   We split the Creme Brulee.... 2 thumbs up. It was great and the texture was just right.  I think  I'd give Peculiar Rabbit another try in the future, but please give me better luck with the server.",

Very disappointed in this once-promising place.  We stopped in for lunch today at 1.  There were plenty of people on staff and only a few tables occupied but somehow they still found a way to ignore us for large chunks of time.    We watched our waiter hanging out by the door while our water glasses stayed empty and our food sat in the kitchen.  My wife had to walk to the bar to get her water refilled.  It took 45 minutes for our food to come out which is ridiculous considering the small number of people there.  When it did come, it was not warm and it was dried out which tells me it had been sitting there for some time.  Our waiter didn't come by once to see how the food tasted or refill water.  He probably realized that things weren't going so well.  Meanwhile, the manager was running around trying to do the work that waitstaff seemingly wasn't handling. The whole situation was a debacle and it went from a nice Saturday lunch to both my wife and I sitting there annoyed.    Why would we ever spend money to go through that again? Answer: we won't.",

It took a little while for the appetizer to come out (but I didn't notice because I was enjoying the company I was with) and the only reason I knew that was that the waiter brought over a second appetizer as an apology for it taking so long! Started off with the shrimp tacos-- very yummy but the soft taco shells got soggy and fell apart but the flavor was AMAZING , and also got their wings (personally the wings were nothing special I'd stick to the shrimp tacos). Then our waiter recommended the chicken and waffles-- another fine choice. They were served with a sriracha maple syrup and some tasty spicy brussel sprouts. Last but not least the dessert--FRIED OREOS! really you can get one order and share it among 5 people. One is all you need. All in all I went home a happy foodie (with left overs of everything, the portions are huge) Im very pleased with the service and the food and cannot wait to go back!",

Had to ask multiple times for silverware while our food got cold. Service was beyond terrible. Server was indifferent to our presence. Will not be back.

We were seated around 9:15pm and unbeknownst to my party - which was a total of five kind and cooperative people who barely ordered anything - this was 45 mins before the kitchen closed, even though the place stays open until 12am.  After we had been sitting about ten minutes, the grumpy manager came and started setting down some napkins and silverware without a greeting or even a smile. He made sure to let us know with his body language and lack of response that this was a huge inconvenience for him. After we had already got our food and started eating, it was a few minutes to 10pm and one of us asked for extra dressing for a salad. The waitress returned about 5 mins later and told us the kitchen is closed and that specific dressing was house made, so she went to get a different dressing and when she returned, with aforementioned manager grump in tow, she told us that he wanted her to let us know that the kitchen was now closed and someone should have informed us of the kitchen close time when we walked in the door... Um, ok? We already ordered and were eating our mediocre food...  ...So at that point, it was just rude and unnecessary. Even after all that, we were still very nice and polite; the waitress, Brittany, and more specifically the manager need an attitude check. Will not be returning unless I hear of them getting new management. Such a shame since there were a few things on their menu that I'd love to try.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a place to have a drink with a great view of the Charlotte city skyline, especially if it is nice enough outside to be on the roof, this is a great place.  I would give it 4 stars for that purpose.  The 2 stars is for the restuarant portion.  As others have commented, this place used to have a very eclectic, interesting and flavorful menu.  It was also a place where you could find a table where you did not feel you were part of the bar area and have a relaxing meal.  Those days are gone.  It seems the Rabbit is changing into a sports bar of sorts.  Better food than a typical sports bar (though a bit pricey), but no longer a \"nice restaurant\" destination.  We visted last weekend to have a quiet VD dinner. We were seated in what used to be one of the only quiet spots in the restaurant on the first floor at a table against a wall which had a 50\"+ TV which was just 6\" up the wall from the table top.  We literally felt we were in the front row of a theater.  Extremely distracting bordering on the ridiculous.  Not condusive to having a relaxing dinner.  The waitress however realized we were not happy and immeadiatley pulled the plug on the TV.  Kudos to her and her service.  The specials were pricey for the average quality of the dishes we received. Not very special \"specials\".  The menu is vastly different than when it originally opened and not very enticing in our opnion.  I know the original chef left a year or so ago.     I hope they find their identity in the near future, but until then ..... have a drink, soak in the view and move on to dinner somewhere else.",

    "text": "Overpriced, mediocre food. Bland atmosphere. Completely out of place and awkward feeling. Peculiar Rabbit is what happens when you have no vision of what you want to do, but decide to try and capitalize on the success of other businesses in an area. None-the-less, considering who owns it, I'm sure they will spend all the money they can to try and turn it into the go to spot... Even if people only begrudgingly go there.  Case in point: After a dismal turnout for their first 2 months, they decided to start paying $2500 a month to buy up 210 parking spots (far more than necessary for a business of this size) that were previously used for free community parking for all businesses in the area. Now, these spots have been turned into $5 premium parking spots. As a reward to anyone who pays $5, you get a $5 credit at Peculiar Rabbit! Nice, right? No, because you can't just swing by for a drink and get back your money... They expect you to build up a $50 tab at their overpriced restaurant first, before getting that $5 credit. Needless to say, the $50 catch isn't posted on the signs when you pull into the paid parking area. This is the bait and switch mentality of a failed business idea being forced upon a thriving neighborhood.  None-the-less, find some free parking and check out some of the great bars and restaurants in the area who don't need to turn their customers upside down and shake them to get a couple bucks. For breakfast / brunch, I suggest checking out Zada Janes, Bistro La Bon, or Soul. For lunch / dinner, I suggest Midwood Smokehouse, Soul, Dish, Diamond, Fuel Pizza. For drinks, check out Elizabeth Billiards, Twenty Two, Common Market, Thirsty Beaver, Snug Harbor.  Don't waste your time here.",

    "text": "So after thinking of going here \"one day\" we finally did. First of all, do not let my 3 stars change your mind about going to this place. The food is a-mazing. But my lack of 4/5 stars is heavily influenced by the noise level here. Omg, forget hearing what the people across the table were saying, I could barely hear what my boyfriend was saying, sitting right beside me. Their music is loud, and there are people around yelling on top of that and by the end of our evening I had a headache. Maybe it's different if you sit outside or upstairs, but we were on the main floor.  That being said, all the food at our table was good and there wasn't a single thing I didn't like. For appetizers, we had the Devils on Horseback, OMB Pretzels and the Disco Fries. The first two were awesome, the disco fries were a bit soggy. For entree I had the Bahn Mi, my boyfriend had the Peculiar Burger and the two others from our party had the Peculiar Rabbit and the Pork Belly. The Bahn Mi was totally mind-blowing. The Peculiar burger was good, but nothing great. Probably not worth $11 I would say. The Peculiar Rabbit was alright (yes, it's rabbit meat) and the Pork Belly again, was really good.  My only complaint about this place really is the noise level. I know I said it already but it's worth stressing on because it really was annoying. We will definitely go back, and sit outside or on the roof, since it looked really nice out there. I would probably have the Bahn Mi again though.",

    "text": "What happened to this place?  I went here exactly a year ago and was blown away by their menu. They had an awesome poutine selection, lots of other impressive menu items and these sausage rolls that were wrapped in blueberry pancakes that were absolutely one of the best things I've eaten in Charlotte (which is saying a lot). So I find myself asking, what happened to this place since their menu selection is vastly different and even things like their sausage rolls are dreadful now.  I went with my wife on Saturday and we sat on the street level patio which is apparently smoking seating in Charlotte? Weird. Anyhow the service was so-so. The waitress was very nice but barely there. I ordered the sausage rolls which did look a bit different then last year on the menu. Regardless I hoped they were still close to the same.   Wow was I wrong. They were terrible. Different kind of sausage used, it tasted more like a turkey than a pork breakfast sausage. The outside was just this boring bread concoction instead of the super tasty pancake outside like last time. There was no maple dipping sauce, instead it was topped with this awful new sauce that was a tomato base or something. It was so awful I didn't even finish it.   I also had their watermelon and pork belly salad. The Watermelon wasn't ripe or very flavorful at all. The pork belly had a very odd consistency. It felt like they were trying to recreate Soul's famous Pork Belly & Watermelon tacos but in salad form and just failed at it.  The entire meal was such a  disappointment I wanted to get out of there quickly and find food elsewhere. I'm shocked at the drop in quality from last year to now. I'm not sure if they had a change in management or turnover in the kitchen, but this place is a shadow of it's former self. Until things improve you really should go elsewhere since there's so many better places to eat in that area.",

Salsa, bachata, merengue, cumbia... he had it all in his repertoire, and kept us moving for hours! We danced our butts off!

This place always caught my attention because they have like a rooftop with a nice view, specially at sunset. We were a party of 20 people celebrating one of my friends birthday. We got there around 7pm and were sat on the second floor. The place wasn't busy at all. The waitress came and got or drink order. Unfortunately they only had beer and wine to serve, since they are changing their menu all the special drinks were not being served.  The food options are kind of weak and pricey. I am glad they are changing their menus.  The decoration inside is interesting and they can fit a lot of people  in there. Our waitress did a good job but she could've done better.  Our food took around one hour to get ready, take in mind the place wasn't that busy for the food to take so long!  My husband my friend and I decided to order the Korean Bbq fried chicken. The portion of food had no consistency at all!  I had 8 pieces of chicken, my husband 7 and my friend 10. How come they have no consistency on their food portions? Also the wings were just okay, definitely would not order again! I tried some of my other friend risotto and it was no good. I love risotto and can tell that was one of the worst I've ever tried.  As you can imagine I will never be back, which is sad since the place is nice and the service was good, but the food and the wait just terrible!",

To add onto my honesty, this is probably my least frequented spot (next to Whiskey Warehouse) in all of Plaza Midwood but it's a decent place to take friends or family from out of town.   Definitely grab a drink at the bar, and if the weather is right, head on up to the rooftop and enjoy Charlotte's beautiful skyline. Take your boothang and impress them! ;)   The food here has been hit or miss for me. Couple years ago, I came here for a post-work Team Bonding event and they had great food for dinner. I thought I recalled more burger options? Most recently, I came with clients and the food was so-so. I have heard that the weekend brunch here is really great though and a totally different menu so I won't totally disregard them just yet!",

I would say this place is a little over priced for the proportions they give you. But the chicken was amazing! I received one chicken tender, and a waffle for 16 bucks. I will say, it was a harty tender, but still across the street they're serving the same thing w more tenders for 11 bucks.  You can do the bottomless mimosas for 25 a pop per person. Don't think you're about to share this, they will quickly shut you down. A cheaper alternative if you're not wanting to go that route would be to do individuals for 3 bucks a pop.   In short, I will be returning. The service here was excellent.",

    "text": "The owner or manager has somehow gotten my name on his email list and has been persistent in trying to get me to come to this restaurant.   I think they think that I am a still a manager in the pharmaceutical industry and they are trying to get me to recommend them for catering meals in doctors' offices.  I was a little bit surprised to find that this feels exactly like a pub with bar food.  Its atmosphere was somewhat dark and it definitely had the Plaza Midwood funkiness!  Tom and I sat on high top bar stools and had a waitress who was fun and fit the place like a glove.  I ordered the fish and chips. It was a very large portion size.  I would say it was average for what it was. I didn't finish it because I just got full and tired of eating.  Plus, I normally don't order fried food.   The menu was full of different burgers and sandwiches and salads.  For me, it just felt like a good day to order the fish and chips, instead of another day for salad. Sometimes you have to take off your Bugs Bunny hat and eat real food!   I am not sorry that I went here, but would probably not be in a big hurry to return.  I am surely not their demographic ideal. It is a long way from my crib.  But, if you are into restaurants with a funky bar scene, this might be the right place for you.  If you are into fine dining and are a foodie, you may want to choose a different restaurant.   I DO like their marketing and their persistence. It won me over.  And just yesterday, I received an email offering me a free appetizer.  Obviously, I cashed in on this and ordered some chicken wings.  That may have turned out to be my favorite food item today!  The wings were plump and really good with the blue cheese dip.",

There is absolutely no excuse for an unclean environment (I never noticed this during my recent visits) but giving a place 1 or 2 stars because they didnt have carrots to go with your wings or you saw bugs while eating outside is a bit much, to me.  I wouldn't call this place a dive, per se.  However, it doesn't pretend to be an upscale joint, either.  For being a super casual pub-style venue, this place has good food and excellent drinks (for example, try their Kentucky mule). My second time visiting, we went on a Wednesday night and they had good live music.  Restaurants don't often offer such amenities, especially mid-week... because it can cost a lot of $ extra.  This place seems to be more about guests having fun and enjoying good bar food in a laid-back atmosphere.  I've only encountered friendly staff, quick service, and a welcoming environment.  All of that said, I have seen a lot of complaints about unprofessional staff and I did see our server eating his dinner side-by-side with some lady (by their seated positions, assuming to be girlfriend/wife), which I wouldn't normally expect at a restaurant. Every restaurant I've worked at allowed eating on the job, but in the back or otherwise out of sight of customers.  It does seem like the management here may need to run a little tighter of a ship here.",

Although it looks a bit divey both outside and in, Peculiar Rabbit makes high quality food and drink. They have a seasonal menu, and I've had great meals there in both summer and winter now. From a loadedgarden burger to their Summer's End Salad (which gives salad a whole new meaning), you can't go wrong. They also have awesome fries, which is a high compliment from a fry snob like me. They're thick-cut and seasoned, almost so delicious you don't want ketchup (but I still want ketchup because I love that too).  On my last visit, the Goose and I bypassed their crumpled draft beer menu list and found the cocktails on the back of the menu. They had a good range for all liquor preferences and were all reasonably priced as well!",

The Onion soup was good.  The rabbit was great (i would hope) and the pork belly was also very good.  We thought the prices were good for the quality of food and setting was great.

Once you actually get there you will find yet another menu.  So, if you are looking for something in particular that strikes your fancy, don't get your hopes up, it's probably no longer on the menu.  Wait you may say, the menu probably changes often?  No!  According to our server (who was excellent) the menu hasn't changed since she started in February.  We decided only to have several small plates and share..some were hits, some not so much.  I think we all agree the Disco Fries were the best thing we had and the Beef Wellington was really good, but it would have been nice to note on the menu somewhere it was actually de-constructed Wellington.  The pulled pork slider with a sugary glaze on the bun was just weird, some heat or spice to counter the sweetness would have been really nice.

There was no discernable flavor of chimichurri, and I kind of expected some actual chimichurri sauce, but they didn't have that. It just tasted like steak, nothing at all special or rememberable. My steaks at home are much better, and for $27 I could have gotten steaks for everyone! Plus it was overcooked, I asked for medium rare, it came out medium to medium well. I couldn't even finish it it was so tough. The \"salsa\" on top was made from canned tomatoes, kind of gross. The black beans tasted straight from the can, I know because that's how I do mine. If I pay that much for a meal I expect better. The corn casserol was so saturated with butter that the butter seeped out all over the plate. The only thing cuban about this was the sprig of cilantro. My boyfriend got the sheppards pie, and said it was fine but the portion was small for $14. The drinks were well prepared. The dessert was pretty good, a little rich for us and we couldn't finish it. Overall I would return to enjoy a beverage and look out into the skyline, but I will never eat here again, waaay too overpriced for par food. If I pay that much I expect it to be worth it.",

My father worked diligently with the event coordinator, Suzanne, and with her expertise they were able to successfully pull off the surprise.  Suzanne was very helpful, efficient, and organized.  The staff at Peculiar Rabbit were pleasant and very professional.  They assisted with decorating the venue and with creating the theme of the party.  The weather created an unexpected twist as we had planned on having the party on the rooftop, but we decided to have the party inside (due to rain), Suzanne was able to reserve the second floor for our private event with no hassle from other patrons.  The travel theme provided an array of their delicious food (jerk chicken, lamb, etc), which Suzanne and her staff provided the leftover wrapped up at the end of the evening.  We highly recommend The Peculiar Rabbit for any private party needs!",

Clean, cool views of the city, nice decor.   Food: First, our server brought out some delicious chocolate nut banana bread which was a tasty surprise. I ordered the chorizo omelette at the recommendation of our server. So glad I did, because it was so full of flavor. The chorizo was really tasty and perfectly cooked. Paired with home fries, it was a delicious combo. I also ordered a cup of coffee which wasn't too good but that's ok, the omelette made up for it.   The boyfriend ordered the French toast which I snuck a bite of and it was also really good. He loved it too. Peculiar rabbit is generous with their portion size, so go hungry.   The service was attentive and quick and friendly from the time we walked through the door.    I definitely plan to go again for dinner and check out the rooftop seating. Give this place a try!",

We were seated in the downstairs bar area after calling ahead with a reservation for a seat upstairs.  They were not accommodating in the least.  Then it took almost an hour to get drinks.  They were out of beers but didn't tell us until after ordering.  Ordering took another thirty minutes to an hour with food coming out cold, burnt and not together.  My salad took almost ten minutes after the other entrees came out.  We complained to the manager, who we thought was going to help.  He did comp half the checks, which was nice but then everything continued to go down hill.  Our checks were a mess and that took another thirty minutes or longer for them to run out credit cards.    I will never go back here.  The service was awful and food was ok at best.  Also the server was rude.  Sadly, it was my friend's husbands 40th birthday and we expected better than this.  What a horrible evening.  I think the one star I gave this was very generous.  Likely they will be out of business if they continue with these idiots running the show.",

Inside was pretty loud but nothing too crazy.  Took forever to get food. Went with three others and they got their food a good while after we ordered. I got mine about 5 to 10 minutes later. Before that I was approached by the manager and was told they were having to remake my food and it was on the house. Pretty awesome on their part for owning up to it.  Sampler plate or something named similar to it. Eggs, biscuit, cheesy grits, and bacon. Grits were pretty awful. Eggs had no flavor. Biscuit was dry without any flavor. Bacon was good.  Friend got the chicken and waffles. Looked great tasted okay but  without a lot of flavor.  Wife and other friend got biscuits and gravy. Which was totally awesome. Seriously I can only recommend that dish because it was the only thing that had flavor to it.   I will give this place a second chance maybe later and get something off the dinner menu.",

We were sat in one of the small back rooms with an unstable table, which we didn't notice until our beers started sliding. Our waiter asked if we were ready to order not long after we sat down so we asked for one minute. We subsequently waited a long time until we had to flag down our waiter to order.   We ordered the poutine fries and pretzels as an appetizer with the short rib grilled cheese as an entree. After waiting 20 minutes, the short ribs grilled cheese entree came out. The creamed corn side was cold which had me concerned about the state of the appetizers we still hadn't received. After I had flagged down our waiter again, I had to ask him to check on our appetizers.  Luckily the appetizers were warmer and had more flavor than the entree. The pretzels with the beer cheese were good. The fries were also pretty good (especially after we added the beer cheese from the pretzels since there wasn't much cheese on them originally).  All in all, our opinion of the restaurant would probably be very different if the service wasn't so bad. I'd give them leeway if it was a busy night, but on a dead Sunday evening, I'd expect better.",

    "text": "Knowing that it was going to be an awesome Saturday evening weather-wise, I booked our first reservation on OpenTable for the Peculiar Rabbit, hoping to dine outside.  When we arrived, the hostess \"couldn't find\" our reservation (but OpenTable was quick to send me an email later letting me know that I didn't show up for the reservation I made), and we were seated in a \"dining room\" in a side room off the first floor, back in the very corner.  It was great for conversation in an otherwise noisy bar/restaurant, but the room had no atmosphere whatsoever.  It felt like a cafeteria dining room, and put an immediate damper on our first impression/visit.  We stuck with it, though, trying to make the most out of the situation.    We started with the pretzel bites appetizer because it came with a \"beer cheese dipping sauce.\"  You only get a tiny ramekin of \"dip,\" which was actually just the beer cheese soup.  (Our server did kindly bring us more upon our request, though.)   I assumed the beer cheese dip would be different than the beer cheese soup since they'd require different consistencies, but since I'm not a professionally trained chef, what do I know?  I know not to order them again or recommend them, that's what I know.    The pretzel bites were a bit greasy and we realized that we had to ask our server for napkins/silverware, which the hostess neglected to give us upon seating us.  (Seriously--is checking off reservations, seating people, and bringing them menus & silverware too much to ask of one person?  Is it too much to remember?)  My partner ordered the Vegetable Wrap and loved it.  I ordered the Lamb Burger and loved it.  It was juicy and had a lot of flavor.  As a side, I went with French Fries, and they had a lot of flavor, too.  They had a crispy coating on the outside and were an excellent complement to the burger.    Having never dined at the restaurant before, I asked our friendly server Christian about the other floors of the building.  He told us about them and recommended we walk up to the rooftop for the view.  The second floor wasn't that great for dining, but when we got up to the rooftop, we loved the view and saw open tables.  Why wasn't this an option for us?    So because the food and service was great, we'll return, but we'll know what to do next time.",

This neighborhood pub attempts to make everyone feel at home with their comfortable interior and friendly service.  Dora here. Oops. Forgot to snap a picture of that comfortable, inviting interior. I was so impressed with all the beautiful exterior seating.  While we waited for our appetizer, the server dropped off complimentary scones. Fresh out of the oven hot, the coconut pineapple pecan scones melted in my mouth although I couldn't really taste the pineapple.  Dora here. I'd go back just for the scones! Soft, light and delicious!  The Mexican Street Corn Fritters may be some of the best I've ever eaten! Roasted corn on the inside, good texture and golden brown on the outside. The honey-lime cilantro aioli paired perfectly with the fritters.  Dora here. Such a wonderful blend of textures with the crisp outside and soft inside, and loaded with corn. Loved, loved, loved the lime aioli.   The Chicken and Waffles dish was huge! Chicken battered in 12 Herbs and Spices, malted milk waffles, Vermont maple syrup and two soft scrambled eggs. The eggs and waffle took a back seat to the fried chicken. Crispy, tender and moist. Outstanding!  Dora here. I visited Peculiar Rabbit with a dear friend a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it so much, I was anxious to bring Ernie back. The last time, I sampled the PR Burger. Awesome, btw, but this time I ordered the Chicken Biscuit. A giant cheddar biscuit with fried chicken breast, American cheese, hot sauce and mayo served with crispy breakfast potatoes. Yum! A tad spicy, which I like, but I preferred to eat the chicken and biscuit separately. The breakfast potatoes were tasty with the perfect amount of seasoning. I wanted to cry that I had to leave some on my plate. Maybe the next time we'll check out that rooftop deck. :)  ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

The first thing that strikes you upon entering the Peculiar Rabbit is the peculiar environment and Peculiar ambiance that exist within the walls of this Plaza Midwood gem.  Its hard to describe, its kind of dark, feels like your eating in an old house that was remodeled into a restaurant/bar.    As far as the food, I thought it was good not great.

It was a funny coincidence because I was with a friend and had just been telling her how much I despise absolutely everything about bananas, the taste, the smell, the texture... Then we walk in and the bartender immediately suggests that we try The Elvis, a dessert comprised on banana nut chocolate chip bread, peanut butter ice cream, salted caramel, candied bacon and whipped cream! My friend's eyes lit up and 4 out of those 5 components sounded amazing to me so we gave it a shot! We'll it was beyond amazing and the banana flavor was faint enough that I was still able to enjoy the dessert. Every component of The Elvis, including the banana bread, was perfection and this experience definitely makes me want to go back and try some of their other items!   I also found out from the bartender that they employ a pastry chef who is solely responsible for the dessert menu and thought that was very impressive, especially for a gastropub. I would never have thought of The Peculiar Rabbit for a romantic date of dessert and drinks, but now this will go straight to the top of my list!",

    "text": "Is it okay to write a review even though all I had was dessert?  For me, desserts tell a lot about a place.  I look at the dessert menu before I even order my meal typically because I want to know what I have to look forward to.  I also like to see how creative the chef is and if they have gone the extra mile to hire a pastry chef at some of these establishments.  If you put time and money into dessert then you clearly want your patrons to have the full experience and you care about the details.  If you slap on the usual (NY Style cheesecake, molten lava cake, carrot cake, brownie with ice cream, etc) then I have to question your loyalty to your customers.    All of that to say, I was excited to see some creative options when I was handed the dessert menu at TPR this past Friday.  My eyes immediately went to \"The Elvis.\"  It was described as a chocolate chip bread with peanut butter ice cream, whipped cream, etc.  I was so excited but once it came out and I took my first bite, I was so distraught.  The bread was so dry!  What was it? Ezekiel bread with some chocolate chips smashed in?  The ice cream layer was so thin that you couldn't even take your spoon to get scoop.  it just melted into the hard, dry bread and it wasn't even making the bread soggy if that tells you anything.  How could this be?  How could something that sounded so good, be so awful?  I have to say, this was probably one of the worst dessert experiences I have ever had.    Good thing they have a fabulous rooftop and are in such a great location.",

Ordered the corn fritters, and it took about 25 minutes for them to come from the kitchen, at 6PM on a Thursday when the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded. This meant I had to wolf them down quickly in order to make it to our concert on time.  I really wasn't impressed with the dish. The fritters were oily and tasted burnt. It tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in some time, and there had been several items burned in it previously.  The fritters were also lava-hot, which is normally a plus in a restaurant when you have time to eat them, but not in this situation when I had only about 5 minutes to finish all of my $8 dish.  I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the Peculiar Rabbit, but I hear they have a great rooftop view (haven't been up there) and they are rather close to Oven's Auditorium so if I'm back in the area, I'll give them another try.",

    "text": "Food was amazing. (See Pictures) The flat bread was unlike anything I ever had. I love Brussel sprouts - and they did Brussels right in both the dishes I ordered. Every ingredient on the menu could be tasted. It was my first time eating at Peculiar and the food did not disappoint!   My group was also able to sit on the rooftop, the view + amazing weather + great food - pretty good combo.  The service was not the best, but our group came at an inconvenient time - and they let us know it. When we got there the hostess told us brunch would be over in 30 minutes, we were actually turning around to leave, but she called us back and said if we ordered quickly it would be fine.  We got sat down, the area was pretty full of people who hadn't gotten their food. We immediately ordered, didn't get our drinks until 15 minutes after and food about 40 minutes after.  Once we got our food, about 10 minutes the waitress was already rushing us about the check and asking if there were any plates she could take away. The whole patio was filled with other groups eating, so we tried not rush enjoying our food - but naturally we rushed. We did decide to just sit and enjoy the view/weather after our plates were taken away.   Nonetheless, food was amazing (5 stars in my opinion) and at a decent price.",

I got the short ribs, mash potatoes and sweet potatoes fries- that's a whole lot of carbs  The ribs was extremely tender and very flavorful. It was a bit salty but I did not mind cause it went well with the mash potatoes. The potion was a bit small, but a value the quality over the quantity. The fries paired perfectly with a beer. Highly recommend and would come by if I'm ever in town again.",

I felt as though I had to justify everything and tell them how amazing it once was, but isn't anymore. There were three of us there and we ordered our food and drinks. The drinks came in plastic bar cups like you would get at a night club...I didn't like my mimosa from a plastic cup. The Bloody Mary was watery. When the food finally came out, there were only two plates...they'd put in the completely wrong order for the third. The waitress hardly apologized and never came back to check up. Finally the food came out, after the rest of us were totally done eating, and she said nothing other than, \"sorry, here's your food.\" There was no real sympathy or apology, no offer to comp anything, nothing. I was so disappointed and probably won't return.",

We had a large party and were seated in the side room. Service was pretty slow and the food was just okay. I had a Cheeseburger while others had Wings, Salads and Ribs. With the restaurant being as quiet as it was I would have expected are service to be a little bit better, but did appreciate they were able to split our tabs and everything was split correctly. Overall, may stop in for a drink again but not sure I would stay for food.",

    "text": "I wish I could give more stars, I feel like 2 is pushing it. I've continually had terrible experiences at The Peculiar Rabbit and was hoping that would change, but it seems to be consistent.   I will review solely on my most recent experience, but again, it was very consistent with the last few times I've been there.   We went in on a week night, it was around 5:30pm--so around dinner time. When we first entered, all the staff was gathered around at the bar and someone said \"Look alive people, look alive!\" what concerned me about this, was that it wasn't just staff members who were working--it was staff members who were there hanging out and drinking, so this didn't appear to be a \"huddle\" before the shift, it looked like they were just hanging out. There was only 1 other table seated at this time. Throughout our entire time there, the staff was yelling to each other across the room or sitting at the bar or playing around right by our tables. It was so unprofessional. Not a single staff member took the initiative to say it needed to stop, manager on duty and bartender included.  We ordered the salmon flatbread to start, it was tasty--but small and came with one quail egg on it, was expecting a little bit more. For entrees we ordered the short ribs and fish and chips. This took quite a while to come out. Our waitress was mediocre at best. We had to ask for silverware after the appetizer came out, and it took 5 minutes to flag her down after the entrees came out to request salt/pepper and ketchup. Once the meals were on the table and we started eating we almost had to ask another server for water because ours was not paying any attention.  The short ribs came with a summer succotash that was SO salty we couldn't even eat it. To be clear, the entire meal was incredibly over salted, but the succotash literally burned your mouth. The fish for the fish and chips was impressive in size, but dripping with grease and mostly breading--I would cut off big pieces that were nothing but breading. I totally get wanting to go for the appeal of how it looks, but to sacrifice quality seems wrong.   The kicker was the bathroom. At this point we've had poor service, poor food quality and then we find out the bathroom is a complete DUMP. I went in right after a staff member to find there was no toilet paper, but they had moved the paper towels in front of the toilet...sitting on the floor. The trash can had no bag in it and was disgusting. It just killed me to know that a staff members saw that and didn't care. That sums up the experience at Peculiar Rabbit, it's like the staff just doesn't care.   Lastly, when I checked into Yelp--it said the soonest they could seat us was 9:00pm. I'm not sure how that is handled, but the place was completely empty other than two tables...had we checked Yelp first, we wouldn't have stopped-in thinking they couldn't seat us. So I'm not sure who handles the Yelp account, but they are either not doing their job, or purposely putting they cannot take tables to keep people out. I'd look into that one if I was the owner.  We've given this place multiple chances, it's just not improving.  At this point we've accepted it is what it is, we won't be back.",

They were out of olives, which happens to be one of my favorite parts in a BM.    The restaurant had opened about 30 minutes before we got there and the top deck was dirty and didn't look as if it was swept or recently cleaned.  There were broken glass pieces  (larger pieces) on the floors between us and a table next to us,  the table Next to us had a young child walking around, so that was our concern.  We told our waitress about the glass all around us and she wasn't surprised and told us ok.  It was very flippant reaction.    So our food came and most of it was just ok - nothing to write home about.  Home fries and eggs were decent, however the biscuit was HUGE but too dry to eat.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for one of her friends birthdays. So there was about 15 of us. However, this place doesn't seem well equipped to handle large parties as the service was really slow (not due to wait staff). Our food took about an hour to come out.   To start off the menus they handed us, the drink specials on the back we're not even being offered. We were told a new menu was coming and that was the reason. Okay, not a huge deal. I have never been here so I didn't really know what to expect from the food menu. My grandmother was British so I grew up eating a lot of English style food. A lot of their menu featured items I ate as a kid. The biggest thing I noticed right away way that a lot of them were kind of British but not the traditional/classic versions. Almost all of the menu items had a twist or spin on them. So if you want traditional style British food, look somewhere else.   Being that a lot of the revisions turned me off from the British items, I decided to try the Korean Fried Chicken. The menu said it came with Drums and Legs. Which are the exact same thing. The drums were not that good. They tasted like old microwaved chicken. The sauce had too much vinegar in it. If you like Korean BBQ chicken, look somewhere else. To make matters worse, my wife and one of her friends both ordered the same thing. Her friend received 10 drums, my wife 8 and myself 7. But we were all charged the same price. The drums were $11. Which I find was overpriced for what I received.   The wait staff was decent but nothing exceptional. But it is a pub, so I don't expect high levels of services. Some of the other people with us enjoyed their food, but my experience left me very unimpressed. I didn't even eat all of my wings, they were that bad. I've had real Korean BBQ wings and this were not even close to what I was expecting.   If you want a place to hang out with some friends and grab some drinks, then this place would serve you well. Other than that, I can't recommend this place at all.",

Took forever to even order appetizers...main entree came out literally an hour later and we waited for the check for another 30 minutes after demanding it.  Often our drinks were empty and to try and smooth things over the waiter brought out disgusting shots that no one drank because...we all had to work the next day and didnt want to waste empty calories on over sweetened pineapple upside down shots....complimentary appetizers would have been a better idea.  Had to remind the waiter to bring out the birthday brownie...and this was after we received our checks which was a little tacky. The excuse for the suckiness was...\"we had a large party\" to which I responded...who's fault is that??? The food was not really that good either...the hummus lacked seasoning. I looked forward to the lamb burger which was dry and dull...the disco fries were pretty good. I think this restaurant is good for brunch but dinner is not their bag for sure. To add, parking is terrible even on a slow night!!!  Lastly, the waiter forgot to split the checks and put the birthday girl's check on everyone else's check and instead of letting us know this he sent another waitress over to inform us because he was embarrassed...this was also tacky and classless as well. Not to mention, Im sure the trainee learned how to suck at her job in the future...will never return for dinner ever again.",

My friend lives right near the Panthers stadium and it was a quick uber ride to the restaurant. Since we took an Uber, I am not sure about the parking situation because I just wasn't paying attention to that. We made a 2:00 reservation, but were having issues with our Uber and called the restaurant to let them know we were running behind and they were understanding and gave us a little more of an extension. We arrived right on time and were immediately seated. We were seated in the front of the restaurant near the bar and it wasn't really busy. The restaurant is large and they have an outside patio and a rooftop area (with a fantastic view I might add).   They are doing a brunch buffet right now so I decided to take a look and see if I wanted that or their plated meal options. The buffet was small and OK. It wasn't bad, but not great either. I did decide to do the buffet since I could just get as much as I wanted for about $17. Some of the items on the buffet include: waffle station, carving station (there was pork and beef on that particular day), biscuits and gravy, meatloaf with cabbage (that was so good!), corned beef hash, cookies, salad, pastries, etc. You could also order eggs, bacon, and sausage made to order in the kitchen and brought out to you. The food was really good.   The drink specials were $5 mimosas and bloody marys and $10 manmosa (2 mimosas and a shot of vodka). I ordered a manmosa and it was good. Strong and good.

Management obviously needs to retrain their employees / hire competent ones who aren't talking behind the backs of other waiters/waitresses to their customers. They need a hostess who is actually at the hostess stand. They need to remove their Bloody Mary from their drink menu. The gamechanger as they call it \"has won many awards\" however you will be extremely disappointed when it comes out with no toppings and a very very,basic probably store bough,  Bloody Mary mix.  Parking is a nightmare as well.   Been here 5 times (yea why do I keep coming back lol, stupid friends) and they are consistently bad!! Not worth the price.",

It started off great, but somehow the kitchen stopped giving a darn about the quality of food they put out. Maybe they changed the head chef? We have probabaly been here a total of 8 to 10 times, but the last several visits have been a disaster. The brunch was cold and tasted like it had ben sitting out for several hours before it was served. Not to mention, every time we called lately we got a different answer on whether or not reservations were needed. We were turned away last time, because we did not make reservations, but I was told on the phone we did not need them? Get your act together people, and for our sanity please hire some decent waitstaff. I know this is a hipster part of town, but you do not need completely green wait staff working at a place that requires reservations, or do they?",

The only thing I didn't like was the celery mashed potatoes. My boyfriend got the peculiar rabbit and really liked that as well as his mashed potatoes. He was impressed at how tender the rabbit was. Lastly, we split two desserts: the apple rhubarb crumble with honey wildflower ice cream and strawberry panna cotta. He doesn't like sweets but really loved both of them. I liked them both as well.

    "text": "So...my husband and I were a little leery of a giant restaurant owned by Jackelope Jack's in the heart of our neighborhood. Maybe rightfully so. This week we've been there twice, on a Monday and a Wednesday. The first night we hung out on the second floor, in the game room and at the bar. We sampled their selection of beers and besides the service, were pretty pleased. The bartenders didn't seem to know anything about wine and little about beers (except for what they didn't have) and were pretty uninterested in us for the most part. The shoddy service might be a theme, as it just got worse on our second visit, not what we expect from a restaurant in PM. This time we felt like the server was rushing to get us out since we only had a beer a piece and split two apps. We were only there for 45 min. He kept trying to take a menu from us that we we kept in case we wanted to order more. He then kept trying to give us the check, they weren't busy, mind you. We ordered the duck mousse which is phenomenal (order extra crackers as they don't give you nearly enough for the generous portion of mousse) and the PEI mussels (not so good. Pretty scronny and about 1/4 were empty shells. The ham and pbr broth is not very flavorful, lacking salt, and isn't hardly enough in my opinion). The frites that come along side though, with the homemade ketchup, are up to par, nice and crispy. Hopefully they are still working some things out because it would be a shame to have such a monstrosity of a business in my hood that I can't enjoy. Hands down, BEST view of the downtown skyline I've found.",

Very flavorful with some asian inspired spiciness. Girlfriend was not as lucky.  Her braised pork was a huge piece of inedible fat. Yes, it should not be a lean cut of meat but it was like a slab of lard. Dessert was great. It's called The Elvis. The name alone gives you a hint that it's going to be big and decadent and it is.  Big enough for 3 or 4 to share. Service was good for us but we could see from the tables around us that not everyone was so lucky. But we had a very good waiter. So all in all they hit on 2 of the 3 dishes and we had good service. Not sure if we would go back though. It's not fair for people to gripe about the parking because that is a neighborhood trait and not their fault. If you don't like hunting for parking and your parallel parking skills are weak, you may want to skip plaza mid wood altogether anyway.",

If I have to offer advice I would say split a bunch of bar snacks everyone I have had has been awesome. For dinner I have had the scallops and pork belly and both were great.

Sunday I decided to take my wife out there for a late lunch at around 2:30 in the afternoon, and it was a great visit once again. It was her first time there so I gave her a quick tour, the patio was a bit too chilly so we grabbed a table on the second floor with great views of the skyline.   She had a Peculiar Burger ($12) and I had the OMB Baby Back Rib plate ($12)...  The burger was a good lunch portion with a side of fries, my wife usually likes her burgers fairly plain but the egg and bacon were a nice treat that she loved!  The ribs were cooked well (fell off the bone and with lots of good flavor) and a great portion, I wasn't able to eat them all and had to take some home  For dessert we had the donuts ($7) and they were awesome! They come with both a chocolate and raspberry dipping sauce, my wife and I both preferred the raspberry since we are not huge lovers of chocolate, but the chocolate was good when I tried it.  Definitely going back again, for the food, and a beer special in the $3-4 dollar range would keep me just to grab a drink more often (I didn't check last time I was there so they may already have a beer special of sorts, I will have to find out.)",

My sister ordered two cocktails & both tasted like cough syrup. That was the only part of the dinner that came up short. We ordered the shepherds pie & it reminded me of something my mom would make, which is def a good thing. Very comforting. Last but not least, we got the chocolate car bomb for dessert which was amazing. Overall we had a great experience & will be coming back soon to try the salmon!",

The rooftop does have a great view but I would suggest just enjoying it with a couple after dinner drinks and eating elsewhere.",

    "text": "The peculiar rabbit seems to come under a lot of scrutiny due to its location and I guess some history people have with the management. Personally, I'm not too tied in with all that drama so I'll have a go at typing out my impressions.   The inside itself is pretty inviting with the wood floors and bars and moderate decorations. There wasn't any whacky stuff hanging from the walls and you definitely get the feel that they were trying for a more upscale atmosphere with this restaurant. The staff is friendly as you'd expect and I personally didn't have any trouble with the service. They do have a nice selection of beers and some stuff from local breweries which is great to see around. The food on the other hand was just kind of ok. I've tried some of the appetizers (fries, oxtail poutine) and a couple of the other menu items (Burger, Sliders) and nothing really blew me away. It was all adequate but with the menu prices where they are you'd probably expect a little more bang for your buck. If I was going to spend 40-50$ on a meal I'd probably want to just skip on over to Soul which is in the same area with better prices and much better food imo.",

We all ordered the burger platters and all of us were very disappointed. in fact none of us came close to finishing what was  on the plate. the fries were old and spongy, they had been sitting in the fry for hours. All 3 hamburgers were burnt and not cooked to any of our likings. We all agreed that we would have been better off visiting a McDonald's. For $57 with included 2 drinks, it was not worth it. We left and went to Fridays and had a great meal  All in all I would go for the crowd and a drink or two, but pass on the food....go else where.",

The bread that came with it was undercooked & turned doughy when dipped. Toasted bread would have been better. I got the pork belly & the flavor was good but it was dry & stringy. I was hoping I could cut it with my fork but I def needed my knife. The brussel sprouts were under cooked. I also had to add salt to all of it! Not a good sign. My gf played it safe & got the burger, which she's had before. I refuse to eat their burger because I want the Kobe Beef burger Jackalope Jack's used to have. Why don't they have one here? I think I'm done trying this place for a while. I had the fried chicken & waffle another time I ate here & it is just a boneless chicken breast like u would get from the store. $18 for a chicken breast??? The flavor was good but if it came with a bone-in breast & thigh it would have been amazing! Might try brunch in the future. I heard it was pretty good. The waitress was nice.",

Our waitress, as many reviewers have said, was good BUT not well-served herself by the kitchen on the Sat. Night we visited around 8 PM. Appetizers came out quickly; then we waited & waited for food, finally truly pleading that they at least serve the 9-year old with us. They did that but other plates then trickled out over such an extended time that the last of our party was only served as those served earlier were finishing up. My advice: don't go with a family or people who are tired or hungry; the wait for food can just be too long.",

We had to wait about .15 minutes for a table to be cleared. The restaurant was busy and at about 80% capacity. When we sat we noticed no Silverware or maintained table . Table was still dirty and sticky from pancake syrup. The server arrive promptly to take drink orders - ironically drinks took .15 minutes to arrive and were blamed on the Bar being slammed. The Manger came by after we complained about drinks not coming out and he said they were busy and blamed it on large parties, un-expected business and offered no additional assurance. He was very Rude and un-professional. The Food did finally arrive in pieces. some of us got our order as others had to wait. The server and everyone seemed Hungover and clueless. I asked for a shot of Fireball and they said they were out. We were also told they were out of at least 3 other advertised Draft Beers. Overall the service was a 2 out of 10 we asked for extra napkins and that took forever, we actually had to ask for silverware and that took too long. The Manager with the Black hair was never compromising nor polite - he looked like he had a rough night the day before. I can't say Ill be back. This place has potential but the Lunch menu needs to change - there are too many Breakfast items listed for a 1:00/2pm lunch crowd.",

    "text": "Perhaps my expectations were set too high, but I am just not as impressed as I had hoped.  I have been to Peculiar Rabbit twice--once for dinner and once for brunch. We decided to try it out after a co-worker recommended going for a few drinks but once I saw Chicken & Waffles and Disco Fries on the menu I decided I needed to try the food as well.  The building itself, dining areas, bars, and rooftop are splendid and I will definitely be returning solely for the sunset view of the city. Caution: Be sure to check the weather, our first visit was plagued by sporadic raindrops, which sent us running under the awning a few times.  The drinks are strong and the craft beer selection was impressive. I enjoyed my Bloody Mary, but was slightly annoyed to have to have the spice subdued. Not a big deal.  We had a very difficult time with our waiter. Bless his heart, he was extremely friendly and admitted he was new, but made many errors with our order and had to be reminded of drink orders a few times.  The disco fries were the exact over-indulging, heart attack-inducing deliciousness you'd expect. If you're looking for comfort food, these are your answer.  I ordered the chicken & waffles and was disappointed that the waffle wasn't light and fluffy but overcooked and flaky. Long story short, the flakiness of the chicken (which alone was not too bad, but again, overcooked) paired with the overcooked, flaky chicken turned my meal into underwhelming flaky, overcooked mess. Thank god for the maple glaze, which may have been the best part of the dish. In summary, I should have ordered the shrimp & grits.  I wasn't keen on returning for brunch only a week and half later but were meeting friends and didn't really have a choice. I ordered the eggs benedict, a predictable choice for me.  Hollandaise was bland, shaved ham was flavorless and the hash-browns did not taste homemade. I was not very pleased with my meal, but to be fair, I tend to be overcritical when it comes to eggs benny's and very rarely am I impressed. :)  Overall this is a fun place to grab a few drinks or watch the sunset on the rooftop but the food seems to fall a bit flat. Too bad, I really wanted to like it.",

They have a full bar on the roof and will let you wait up there for your table. Also our appetizer, the duck quesadilla, was literally one of the best food items I've ever had. My boyfriend got the short rib grilled cheese and said it was good.  THE BAD: I ordered the salmon and it was terrible. It was overcooked and was much worse than any easy salmon you could make yourself at home. Not sure if that was just a fluke but I was really disappointed. There also were quite a few cockroaches running around on the roof. I don't really think this is their fault, it is an outdoor patio after all, but was still pretty icky to see and might deter you from going if bugs freak you out. Letting people wait on the roof for a table was great but they don't have any clear area available so it can be hard to find somewhere to stand. We ended up putting our drinks on the railing and standing between two tables of diners while we waited. This could probably be fixed with a couple small standing tables and rearranging the tables.  Overall, I might go back for a rooftop drink but would be careful about what food I order.",

One rooftop experience was well, weird. We went for a late lunch, ordered, food, it arrived then that was it!  No follow up to see if we needed anything, no check, no nothing. We ended up (because we are nice people) taking our own dishes down four flights and paying our tab at the bar.  A few weeks ago, again for lunch, the rooftop was not open (no explanation) so we sat on the ground floor patio.  We ordered avocado fries as an appetizer, which were not available. Darn.  I find the service to be somewhat slow and inconsistent every time we visit.  I think the servers need a nice pep talk because they all seem to be slightly disinterested.  Our very first visit had us on the rooftop and waiting 20 minutes for a server. When he arrived he said he had overslept and they were short staffed.  Too much information. Just apologize for our wait and take the order, life goes on.   But of course, for the food, we will be back.",

    "text": "This was our first time at the Peculiar Rabbit, as we are new to CLT and trying out as many places as we can to find some regular go-to spots. I was excited to try this due to reviews I read, and its proximity to Legion Brewing and Plaza Midwood.  We arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated. The server was very attentive and prompt in getting our drinks, and in checking in on us through the meal. My low rating is due to food quality and value. Our server did what she could, and management was attentive and apologetic as well.  I ordered the paella, my husband the wagyu burger, cooked medium. The food came out within 15-20 minutes, hot. The paella was about 10 parts risotto to 1 part proteins (chicken, shrimp and salmon). The dish was well seasoned and tasty, but would have been better with more veggies... or, waaaaaay less risotto.  The wagyu burger was overcooked, and dry, which was sad given the price point and type of meat. Our server promptly addressed this and offered a replacement. No harm, no foul. Unfortunately, the second burger came out just as overcooked as the first. The meat was tasty, but dry and unappealing.  Both the server and manager were more than accomodating, apologetic for the quality of food. The matter was handled appropriately, but I was disappointed at the experience. We may go back, but it will be awhile.   I have yet to find somewhere that is a go-to mid-tier priced joint to get reliably good food, have a good beer list, etc. Pro-tip: If you want a slammn' burger, head up the street to Moo and Brew.",

The bar is usually ok service, but if you sit at a table be prepared to have a very uninterested 20-something kid take your order, mess it up, and then forget about your party (that has been more or less my experience every time).

However, I usually give every place a 2nd chance before I make my final judgment.  This time we have a groupon so we went during dinner peak hour on Sat night. The place seems way more crowded than last time. We got seated pretty quickly, and the server was ok. He was not that attending because he didn't check on us after he delivered our food but to give us our check. But it was much better than last time.  The food is ok, but they are way overpriced. Korean BBQ skewer consists of 2 beef skewer is $10. A bowl of fries with oxtail sauce, mushroom, and cheese is $10. This 2 I can accept, what made me crazy is the lobster mac & cheese. The plate is $22 itself without any side items, so I expect at least a handful of lobster meat. Instead we got a bowl of pasta salad looking pasta with no more than 5 piece of meat, and a tiny spoon of crab meat slaw. The entree is very disappointed, because for that price I can get unlimited crab leg somewhere else. And not to mention it did not tasted like Mac & Cheese at all!!!  So will I go back for food, definitely NOT! However, I might go back for a drink at the rooftop for the view of the city, not because the restaurant itself attracted me back.",

I was being a diva and left. Advice: If it's not broke, don't fix it.   On a positive note, anything with salmon is good here. They make mustard sauce in house, so sometimes it's stronger than others.",

Really tasty, my friends and I almost always get them when coming here to go along with our drinks.  No problems with the staff, they've always been cordial and friendly even when coming here during late hours.  Another thing about this place is that it has 3 different levels to it.  There is a very nice view of Uptown Charlotte you can see if you sit at the top.  Good spot to check out with a lady friend.  Recommended.",

The inside upstairs bar is also pretty cool, too. There are plenty of hightops that aren't positioned right on top of each other, so you have room to breathe,  which makes it more relaxing. I don't really care for the inside/downstairs area though. I found the tv too loud down there (has music videos cycling on it). My preference is definitely the outside seating areas and the inside upstairs bar area.",

Lots of beers on tap - at least six local brews - as well as just about any mixed drink you could want.  I tried the Ghost Burger with the sweet potato mash.  Actually preferred the mash to the burger - the bacon slices in with the sweet potatoes were quite tasty!  The Ghost Burger itself was spicy but not outrageous.  A bit overcooked, but the grilled onions on touch were a nice touch.  Waitstaff was not great, but it was a Friday night so they probably were just prepping for a long night.  Prices were high - spent $20 for a burger and beer.  Would expect to pay about $10-15 for the quality of the food served.",

As did others outside waiting.    Either the staff has no way of marking what tables are what.  Every time new food came out to terrace the runners stopped at every table ( Including folks already eating). With plates of food.  Asking \"is this your order?\"     The entire experience was chaotic.    Months ago I dined there and had similar experience.   For the Price point of the food.  I expect better service.",

I visited the downstairs bar while waiting for the group and enjoyed the excellent selection and bar tenders' personalities.  After moving upstairs (2nd floor) with the group, we were well taken care of even with the large number of guests.  I ordered the chicken and waffles which were great, not the best I've ever had but I'll have them again.  The other food around the table looked good with most folks offering compliments.    Along with pricey food and drinks, this place has a loud, trendy, almost college vibe but I'll be back.",

    "text": "Last night was my second time going to The Peculiar Rabbit, the first time for food. The first time I only went to the bar and it had been a very good experience. While there the last time I had stared in awe at the beauty of the chicken and waffles, so I decided I should go and try the food. The environment at Peculiar Rabbit was a typical pub like atmosphere, nothing too out of the ordinary.   After debating on the menu for quite some time I decided to try the Peculiar Burger with corn pudding, although the Krispy Kreme Sliders and Chicken and Waffles tempted me. The burger was good, but nothing too special. To me the corn pudding was kind of mushy and didn't have much flavor. My friend had the mac and cheese, which came with slightly unappetizing pork but I guess tasted good.  I think the worst part for me was the staff. At first our waiter was marginally attentive, but as the night went on she became more pushy and rude. Normally when I eat at a restaurant, waiters have the curtesy to allow you to finish at your own pace, eat, converse, and pay on your own time. Not is the case at the Peculiar Rabbit. We were given our check while we still had an entire beer left. For the first time all night our waiter was on top of her game. After that we paid and she even took our checks after we signed, while we were still there. Its a little thing I know, but it was the first in a series of uncomfortable events that told us we were no longer welcome to stay at this table. Then several different waiter came by, lurked, and bused one thing at a time off our table. All the while we are still drinking our beer. They basically could not show us out the door fast enough. As we walked out I heard waiters talking about us and the hostess gave us a curt goodbye. The menu is interesting, but the service really ruined the whole experience. If I try again I hope the staff learns some manners.",

    "text": "So, the food was good, not great, but I'd go back to try other things on the menu if the rest of the experience was great, but it wasn't.  I had the chicken and waffles upon suggestion from our server.  The chicken was a bit salty and dry, but I'd give other things on the menu a shot, it looks like there's potential.  Peculiar is the perfect word to describe our overall experience.  Our party of three arrived and was told there would be a 30-45 minutes wait (for inside or outside) and that all the bars were open if we wanted a drink.  My friends suggested we go to the rooftop where I would be able to take in the skyline (I was visiting Charlotte).  When we arrived upstairs, we noticed that nearly every table was empty.  So, we thought that maybe they weren't seating dinner on the rooftop (it was a nearly chilly March evening).  We asked if we could sit at a table while we waited for our table for dinner and were told no, that we would have to see the served to be seated.  Whaa?  So, after about 20 minutes of waiting, one from our group went back downstairs to ask about seating, since there were clearly (dozens of) empty tables and clearly people waiting.  She was told that the 'kitchen asked them to slow things down since they're fully booked.'  About four minutes later, the hostess came upstairs and invited us to sit at the vacant table we had been standing next to for 30 minutes.  We then had a hard time reading the menu and navigating our meal because there wasn't much lighting.  I mean, shame on us for sitting outside?  Peculiar, indeed.  By the time we left, the rooftop was pretty packed with people getting their weekend drink on. I mean, I get if the kitchen doesn't have the capacity (maybe), but it seems like a better approach would be to not allow dinner guests on the rooftop and offer it as a place for drinks/to wait.  The whole experience was just bizarre and left us wondering what was really going on.",

Today, I had the club sandwich for $12.  The description sounded awesome...but the actual product was disgusting.  Dry, old bread...a little swipe of mayo on the bottom...lunch meat...1/5 a piece of old bacon...very disappointing.  The $3 diet coke really drove me over the top.  $3 for a diet coke from a fountain...really?  The waiter removed my sandwich and $3 diet coke from the bill.  But if I had not spoken up, I would have been overcharged.  We are not going back to the Rabbit this year.  Too many other places to eat lunch.  Sad because they use to be good...but the past 6 months has gone down hill.  I'm sure it is hard to keep people working in a restaurant, but good food is your product.",

We had the poutinne fries and the wings for appetizers both of which were just okay. We had the chicken waffles which was very salty and not a crowd pleaser in the group. Someone else ordered the short rib grilled cheese which consisted of a lot of different cheeses and not that much short rib. We weren't offered a dessert menu and we had to ask three times for water for the table. We were looking forward to trying this restaurant but left disappointed.",

Didn't much care for the Lamb Lollipop, which had ground lamb.  I ordered the Rabbit for dinner-something I had never had before. Not my favorite, but it was good. The best meal of the night was the Pork Belly (it was on special and is currently NOT listed on their menu; it was not served with noodles). The ribs were also fantastic!  We had drinks all night from the bar-great beers, and fantastic hand crafted drinks as well.  Great atmosphere, so eclectic and really fun to people watch there.

I dined with a dear friend for lunch today, it had been awhile since we'd seen each other, so needless to say the menu what not high on the priority list. Our waitress was very kind and checked back with us several times to see if we were ready to order. After awhile she came back cordially as ever and we placed our orders. I ordered the bahn mi and asked her opinion on it. Surprisingly she gave me a very honest answer, \"I don't particularly like it, but some of the staff claim it to be their favorite.\", I risked it and I'm glad I did. It's not traditional in any sense of the word but it was delicious nonetheless.   I recommend giving this place a shot. Do be aware though that parking is a little questionable.

My friend and I both ordered coffee. The coffee arrived with a bowl full of crinkled up brown equal and Splenda packets and the tiniest little pot of cream I've ever seen. The server was nice enough to run to the kitchen to bring us some real sugar. Alas, once it arrived, there weren't any spoons to stir the sweet goodness into our cups.   Fast forward to the food. The grits tasted like a strange sweet creamed corn and the chorizo omelet was just okay. My friend ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon. Let me just say, hashbrowns do not mean cubed fried potatoes. I mean really, they're like mini-fries. What is the fun in that? And the scrambled eggs? Well, they were a bit creamy. I think they were underdone.   Their menu has a lot of variety and I give them kudos for that. However, I can't say that they do any of it well. The view is nice and the vibe is chill. Other than that, I don't think I want to eat here again. Perhaps just drink?",

We were seated on the second floor, and it felt hot initially, but that was most likely due to my walk. Drink orders were quickly taken, and bread with butter was served.  The area was brightly lit, and loud, commercial pop music played.  Would have preferred dim lighting and background jazz, but I am sure they are going after the young demographic . I ordered the Mediterranean plate, which featured pickled vegetables, hummus, pita bread and falafel.  Delicious, and a nice portion for a light meal.  Service was on point, even when it came to bringing the checks. There are a couple of things that I found unappealing.  I excused myself to go to the ladies's room, which is downstairs.  A server who was ascending cut me off, causing me to wait.  You can \"ma'am\" me all night long, which they did to my annoyance, but actions speak louder than words.  Show your manners. Furthermore, this building used to be a beautiful, old church and now it resembles a big box, cookie cutter chain restaurant.  Sure, they can cram them in and give them a view, but there is absolutely no charm in this place. Still, the restaurant is in my neighborhood, plus food and service was decent.  I will support it.",

    "text": "I bought a Living Social Deal for TPR because it included alcohol, something I'm always excited about because deals normally do not.   We went here with a couple of our friends and between the table ordered muscles and fries, and disco fries for appetizers, and then we got the BBQ sliders, fish and chips, ribs with corn pudding, and burger with butternut squash bisque.   I thought the disco fries were very good. They included meat, which the one other time I've had them they only cheese and gravy, but I liked it a lot! If you haven't had disco fries you should definitely give them a try. I had the burger with butternut bisque. I got the bisque as my side (which they do not charge extra for), because we got the fries earlier and it had creme fraiche (South Park nerd). The burger was pretty good, fairly standard. I thought the soup was the star of my meal.   Everyone also got a 20oz beer (they have 10oz and 20oz), which was around $5.50. They do not have cider :(. The bartender was also nice enough to give us an \"extra\" beer that they had for Free. Love Free.   Our waitress was Megan, who I thought was good. It did take a while to get going, but you have to remember this place is fairly large with 3 floors. We made a reservation for 6:30 on Open Table because they did not have any 7 available, although they had plenty of tables still available at 7.   To address the parking situation, we were able to find it pretty easily, and we did NOT have to pay any money, which is something I know a lot of other people posted about.   After the Living Social deal we were only left with a tab of a little over $3. (The deal was for $40, and we got the disco fries ($10), a burger with soup ($9), ribs with corn pudding ($16), and a 20oz beer ($5.50).)    So if you find yourself wanting to try something new I suggest The Peculiar Rabbit, good ambiance, lots of TVs, and good food!",

It's very American of me to want more cheese on everything though, especially when the cuts of oxtail were surprisingly large and juicy. If I could change them, I would put curds of cheese, more like the amount found in poutine and shred the oxtail pieces into the gravy to make them easier to eat and share.   My dining companion had the burger with an egg, bacon, and pimiento cheese on it. It was giant and difficult to hold and eat - I would suggest offering to cut it in two or sending a knife that's up to the challenge out with the burger. I tried a bite -- it was delicious, but very messy due to its size and construction.   I had the chicken and waffles and while I was initially concerned about anise being added to the syrup (I don't like licorice flavors), I tried it and it added a depth of flavor to counteract the sweetness of the syrup while being otherwise unoffensive. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy inside a crispy crust of breading. The waffle was made with cornmeal, which helped make it less like a typical breakfast waffle. The Brussels sprouts were caramelized with bacon. All the flavor profiles on the plate meshed very well.",

I was part of a large group celebrating a birthday and I enjoy hitting the Plaza Midwood neighborhood now that I live in the 'burbs.  Found the interior inviting and loved the track doors and woodwork.  I am not a fan of sitting on barstools so I chose the booth side of our platform raised table near the bar.  Our server was excellent, and realized we had some old menus.  I have to admit the overhauled new menu was much more to my liking.    We shared pimento cheese, pretzels, and deep fried veggies for our apps. I found the pimento cheese a bit dry, but well seasoned. I skipped the other apps, but the rest of the group enjoyed them. The large bite size pretzels and beer cheese were the crowd favorite.  For my entree, I chose the chili. I would call it greek style, sweet and slightly spicy. I really appreciated the portion size too.  This place is huge with three floors, VIP room and a roof top bar that has excellent skylne views. The main floor bar had a nice buisness for a Monday night and should be drawing a neighborhood crowd.  Our server was excellent and had no qualms about seperate checks and splitting the birthday girl's tab among all of us.      I cannot complain about parking since it was a weeknight, but I know that I sympathize with other Yelper's complaints about the $5.00 charge.  We actually parked across the street.",

It was a nice find with 2 levels, and the 3rd, being on the rooftop.  The people who worked here were kind enough to provide the event with New Years gear, champagne, and fun sparklers!   Overall, the setup for Peculiar Rabbit is great because I tend to get bored being in one area, and I am able to move around on different levels, or play pool in another room, or just grab some fresh air on the rooftop.  The place is also new looking, and is not shabby at all!",

It's just ridiculous to rate this place 1 star because of that.  Broke ass hipsters need something to complain about.  Weird thing is, most of them don't even drive. Ironic, huh?  They always have drink specials, even on weekends.  I hate when I go somewhere on the weekend and they don't have ONE special.  You'll always find one here.  Last time I was there was the epic 'ice storm' of 2013 (lol).  They had $3 imperial winter draft pints.  That's a 20 oz beer by the way.  The food has always been consistently good.  They source local ingredients, which is the norm now if you want to be a hip place.  My favorite dish from what I've had was the fish n' chips.  Waitress persuaded me to get it because the Triggerfish was fresh off the boat that day.  Needless to say it didn't disappoint.",

    "text": "Do you like paying exuberant amounts of money for mediocre bar food and domestic drafts? Then this is the place for you!  When I first walked into The Peculiar Rabbit I noticed the lack of, well, everything. The bland decor, the lack of customers, and a complete disregard for the plaza-midwood neighborhood mentality, made me feel a bit peculiar. See what I did there!?  It is very apparent that this restaurant is trying to play off the success of more \"upscale\" businesses in the area. With a restaurant like Soul around the corner who offers a much better atmosphere, food, and price point, it is hard for me to understand why anyone would waste their time and money on this establishment. It is amazing how uninspired this business is and how their idea of making a restaurant a success is to alienate the community and throw money around. Just because you built a giant crap hole with a nice roof deck, doesn't mean you can ask people to pay ungodly amounts of cash for a bud light and a burger.  Their real mistake is when they started to infringe on the accessibility of local businesses by leasing a vast majority of the parking spots in a lot that serves many establishments. Which is kind of a peculiar (LOLZ GET IT) site because there are a total of maybe 5 cars at any given time using the $5 to park makeshift lot. Good thing you guys paid all that money to rope of the parking lot because it is really being utilized.  The only redeeming factor of this place is the staff. Which were friendly and helpful.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this worthless business.",

    "text": "Despite the uproar that this place has caused, leading many Plaza Midwoodites to call it the Puke-ular Rabbit, I enjoyed my dinner here.  The interior is strange but as Ron Burrrrr-gundy would say \"that's a given\" since the shape of the building is right out of an Escher creation.    Service was all over the place.  We had a lot of different people come by our table and some of them were attentive and others seemed to be checked out.  But the mussels and the large pours of Belgian beer were very tasty.  My wife got some sort of seafood conglomeration and enjoyed it.  By the way, IN RE the parking situation, I live just down the street and y'all can come park in my driveway for free if you do something nice or funny for me.  Y'know, leave a little package of Swedish Fish in my mailbox.  Or maybe you can dress up like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins and sweep my sidewalk and sing Chim Chimaree.   Anyway, if you can figure out the parking thingamajig, I think it's worth a visit to Peculiar Rabbit to give it a shot.  And stop by all the other cool places nearby afterwards - Snug Harbor, 22 Gallery, Petra's.",

    "text": "My wife and I and another couple visited this restaurant on a Friday night.  Luckily my wife had made reservations several days ahead of time, because when we arrived at 7:00, the wait was 1.5 hours.  We were seated promptly at a nice four top table next to a window on the first level.  Unfortunately, things went down hill from there very quickly.  Our waiter came over for our drink orders and we had to tell him multiple times which wines we wanted and finally had to point to them in the menu so he could write them down.    Drinks came and then we ordered appetizers. After 30 minutes, I had asked the waiter to check on the order.  The appetizers were delivered a short time later.  We then put in our dinner orders, and after about an hour, I finally asked another waiter working in our section if the kitchen was having problems because the delay in getting our food was ridiculous.  BTW, we are not high maintenance people so it is very unusual for us to ever complain.  Jason, the manager, came over to our table and apologized for the delay and said it was our waiter's first night and they had to pull him off the floor because he had gotten overwhelmed.  Jason said our food would be on them for our trouble.  Fair enough.  Class move by him to admit the problem and make it right.  That's when things got really strange.  15 minutes later, Jason came back to the table and said the food was being plated.  Then, a short time later, our original waiter (the one who had been \"pulled off the floor\") came back to the table as if nothing had happened and asked if we wanted dessert!  We had to tell him we still hadn't gotten our food and he promised to check on it.  Finally, about 30 minutes after we were told the food was being plated, it arrived piping hot.  Jason came back to the table and admitted that there had been issues in the kitchen as well and comped our entire meal drinks and all.  The food itself was great once it arrived and Jason did what a good manager does when there is a problem which is why I gave it two stars instead of one star, but it is hard to overcome the bad impression the service made.  Maybe the restaurant needs to limit the number of seatings per night until the kitchen and wait staff rise to the level of their food.",

Then we ordered drinks and tried to order food, they were out of what I had chosen, of course that happens, but added to the bad experience, server was trying their best at this point.

I had the chicken biscuit and ask for gravy instead of hot sauce and mayo, I was a little disappointed because the gravy came on the side in a very very small bowl. I was hoping that they'd just smother it in gravy. Oh well. My husband got a burger and fries and said it was pretty good. We got there around \"Brunch\" time, the menu didn't have a huge selection and I did think it was a little pricey. After eating, I had to adventure to the second floor. Off to the side where the bathrooms are was another sitting area where they had these awesome paintings of Alice in Wonderland scenes. I love restaurants that have funky art work on the walls. Overall it was an okay place to eat.",

Another time I went a friend ordered a side of toast that was not brought until almost 15 minutes into our meal. The last time I went I had coupons and asked the hostess if I could use multiple since there was no mention of combining coupons. She said they now had that stipulation in writing on the new coupons, and since mine was before that I should be able to combine. Of course when we got the check the waitress refused to apply more than one coupon.   All that said I have never tried (nor am I tempted to) this place for any meal other than brunch.  As a bar this place is fantastic - large beer selection, knowledgeable bartenders and solid views of the city.",

I got the mushroom flatbread and it was really quite good. Our drinks however, were incredibly watered down. I'm a lightweight and if I really had 5 drinks I would have woken up in a dumpster somewhere, but I was quite sober. I really like the place, when it's warm they have great rooftop and outside seating which is great. I'd go again, it's in great position for bar hopping in.plaza midwood.",

    "text": "Amazing city skyline view from their rooftop section, their best feature, especially at dusk/night! Most of my visits here have been only for drinks, as it's a good place to mingle and have convos. The space is separated into three floors, with the middle floor typically the most lively, because that's where most of the alcohol is. Lots of beer on tap and craft cocktails to choose from.   This restaurant deserves more credit for their creative menu. I appreciate the trendy menu featuring unique combos that the chef envisions but unfortunately, the food doesn't seem to leave a lasting impression. Not bad by any means but doesn't stand out enough to warrant the slight price premium of their menu.   Overall, The Peculiar Rabbit is a solid spot to for a casual date or a drinking stop with some friends. It's a bit more low key than I'd personally prefer, lacking much buzz but it has its moments. This place is still good and I'll be back again, but my other neighborhood favorites will more often than not take higher precedence.",

When it was time for the tabs we noticed that we each had a 18% gratuity included. I asked the waiter why we had the gratuity with a party of four. He bluntly said I added it because the person that left did not tip. I said OK that was a 12 y/o child that paid for her own tab and had to leave to get ready for school. As if that had anything to do with the company policy! I asked for the manager he laughed OK sure. The manager came was very respectful apologized and explained that the gratuity should not be included. He offered a gift card I declined but my friend accepted it. I will never go there again. I cannot think of any reason other than bad ones that he would think to automatically add gratuity to our $20 tabs. Sigh",

    "text": "Peculiar Rabbit offers something for everyone.  Let's start with the building itself.  Located in a former church and former nightclub, there are 3 floors with distinct feels.  The front patio is covered - and, weather permitting, usually has a fire pit or two going.  It's a cool vibe, but admittedly can be hard to take advantage of in the brutal summer heat.  The bottom floor has a mix of high tables, booths, regular tables and a bar.  The dark wood makes it's feel very cozy and romantic.  The second floor also has a bar and lots of tables with a great view of the city skyline from the 2nd floor windows.  In the backroom on the 2nd floor, you can play skeeball, air hockey and bumper pool.  This area can be reserved for private parties/celebrations.  The 3rd floor is a rooftop bar with one of the best views you can find of the Charlotte skyline - come prepared for the weather, as there are no heaters or fans.  The menu as Peculiar Rabbit seems to change with fair frequency.  The food is consistently good.  There's a mix of burgers, salads and heavier entrees.  While nothing stands out as a must-have for me, I always enjoy whatever I eat.  A lot of people rave over the fried chicken and waffles - I must say, it always looks amazing.    For beverages - there are about 15 beers on tap and a great selection of cocktails, including 8 or so different mules.  The Plaza Seventy Thyme is one of my favorite cocktails here - it has gin, thyme and st. germain YUM!  I think I come here more for the atmosphere than what's on the menu - but, fortunately, I really do enjoy most everything on the menu.",

My poor server, obviously within his first week, asks her questions and specials of the day. Not only does she not even bother to look up to help him and US, his customers, she stated there are no specials (as I stare at a sign stating the Red Bull&Vodka are $8 every day).

    "text": "I came here last night for my birthday with a reservation made three days in advance for preferable rooftop seating, 8-10 people. We were told the rooftop was full, yet when we went to take pictures of the view there was a COUPLE taking up a long table alone up there. We were seated outside on the patio on the bottom floor. We waited 1.5 hours for our food, after having to specifically request to order appetizers and food. After finally receiving the food (most everyone got burgers), we concluded that it was not worth the wait and was sub-par in taste.   Pros:  The view on the rooftop is beautiful, especially during sunset. Drink service was mostly quick (in the beginning). Pretzels with beer cheese were amazing. Cons: Slowest service I've ever received. It was a Tuesday so I'd hate to think this is how service is during busier times on weekend or at brunch. Burgers had no sauce or cheese. Salad was whole romaine pieces which needed slicing; lettuce was grilled/charred which made the taste kind of odd. Not accommodating at all for a large group or apologetic about the bad service until the very end of the meal when it was time to pay/tip.   The only thing that made this meal bearable was that I was with a large group of people so we could entertain ourselves by talking. After two hours, we were starving and all talked out. We contemplated leaving multiple times but decided to stick it out and give this place the benefit of the doubt - don't. Overall, it didn't make for a good birthday meal and I was disappointed.",

    "text": "The Peculiar Rabbit, or I as I call it... the funny bunny.   No matter what you call this place we can all agree on one thing: the real reason to come here is the rooftop patio. #AmIRight?! Tremendous view of our gorgeous uptown skyline. I think it beats Whisky Warehouse based just on layout and setup.  Foodwise, the menu can vary because of PR's farm to table concept. I really like that. Our latest visit here we ordered calamari. I wasn't a huge fan of the breading. A squeeze of lime drastically made this better. I ordered the watermelon feta salad. Simple, clean, fresh flavors. My friend got the chicken and waffles. Holy, it looked like an entire chicken was on the plate. A-OK is a good description for the food here. I've never had anything bad... it's just there is nothing that has been overwhelmingly impressive.  I've only been here during evening hours, so I usually park across the street at the JLC Wearhouse. (Only when it's closed of course) I don't understand the whole reverse parking thing in Plaza Midwood. You can translate as, \"I'm not very good at parking.\"   I think The Peculiar Rabbit rooftop is a great place to grab drinks and apps for a date, a night out with friends or to kick off an evening. Because of the size and all the levels, it would also work well for a group dinner.",

After 10 minutes, we were told we could sit outside. After about 10 more minutes, we got to get our drink orders in. We didn't complain but we just wanted to order.  After a little more waiting, who I'm assuming is the manager came over and apologized to us that the wait was so long! We said its no problem and thanks for coming over to us. He told us to order a round of drinks of him, wow - that's great service! Well, it would have been, if someone ever came back to the table for us to order said drinks.  Okay, on to the food! We only ordered a couple apps, which were fantastic! We got the beet salad (Yes!) and the Carolina Poutine (HECK YEA). Both tasted amazing, and I'd go back for the food!  Overall, Food: 4.5. Service: 2-ish.",

But due to Souls two hour wait, we came here.   We started off with drinks I kept it safe with a beer but my girlfriends had cocktails that were watered down. We also ordered an appetizer \"Sweet Tea Chicken Wings\" wee great the have us only one ranch when we asked of three. The girls changed their drinks and then dinner came out. I ordered what I thought was a gluten free lamb burger but it was shredded lamb, one of my friends ordered the same. The lamb was so dry I barely would swallow it, I had to chance it with water. On top of that it really wasn't that hot.  After reordering something different the manager came out and I spoke with him. Explaining that my mind was set on their Lamb burger as the menu states it's Burger but items shredded meat. Instead of saying \"oh I apologize that's an old menu, or we haven't updated our menu\". Instead he said \" we no longer the burgers.\" So my question is how long are you going to have False advertisement. But you menu clearly said Lamb Burger.  I've been here three times one in which was a birthday dinner and this by far was the worst",

    "text": "OK, I'm just going to put it out there.  There is no rabbit anywhere on the menu.  Thank goodness though that there is lots of other great food.    I had driven by this place several times recently and wondered how it was being received by the Plaza Midwood area.  When my daughter and her husband offered to take me there for my birthday lunch, I jumped at the chance to check it out.  You can't review The Peculiar Rabbit without talking about the parking situation, or more precisely, the lack of parking situation.  There is literally no place to park legally.  End of story.  If parking in a business lot and sneaking across the street creeps you out then eat somewhere else.  The venue is pretty cool, 3 levels and the layout is nice and cozy.  We opted to sit on the roof.  It was a nice day with a great view of uptown and the service was prompt.  For a starter we went with the mousse and pickles, which is duck liver mouse and house made pickles.  I love duck liver mousse so I was looking forward to this.  It was good but not great, nice and smooth and flavorful, very classic.  The pickles were ...ahem....\"different\".  Okra, radish, mango, jalapeno, and cauliflower, in a sweet, spicy, vinegary brine.    Between us we had 3 different entrees.  I had the braised brisket sandwich.  This was a solid hit.  A nice mound of tender flavorful, juicy brisket that paired beautifully with the caramelized onions and blue cheese, all sitting proudly on a soft but crispy hoagie roll.  French fries are hand cut and fried pretty well with tons of flavor.  My daughter, Melissa had the Banh Mi, a first for her and she is definitely a fan.  She said her life is now divided into two periods, before Banh Mi and after.  The Rabbit's version is pretty traditional with a very flavorful pork patty that Melissa said tasted like the inside of the best egg roll you have ever had.  I tasted it and have to agree.  With the pickled daikon, cilantro aioli, and jalapeno peppers it has that traditional bite of spiciness.  Chris had the lamb burger, big, fat, meaty and so juicy that the juice dripped onto the plate with each bite.  He said it was really good.  He ate it so fast I never got a chance to poach a bite.    If you're in the Plaza-Midwood area for lunch or dinner and don't mind circling the block a couple of times for a parking place, hop into the Peculiar Rabbit and give them a try.",

I had the peppercorn bistro steak and it was cooked and seasoned so perfectly that I would say it rivaled 5 star restaurants. Drunken mussels for an appetizer which were also \"off the chain\".  This place is not McDonalds cheap, but remember, the food is so perfectly prepared that it is worth far more than the menu price.   Don't forget what many other reviewers said... One of the best views of the city hands down, especially if you sit upstairs.   If you live in Charlotte or are visiting Charlotte, this place is worth a visit! YUM!",

Yes I understand it's good for when it rains you can sit out there, but the lighting could be better in my opinion.

This is more of a restaurant than a bar, so I recommend you try their food out. Brunch items are great, as are their burgers, sandwiches, and traditional irish pub food. Do yourself a favor, get a side of the corn pudding. It's the only time I've ever gone to a restuarant and re-ordered something when I ran out.   Give it a shot, sit on the rooftop patio (it's covered so no need to fret over the weather), and enjoy yourself. Great food, plenty of local beers on tap, and typically good rotating drink specials. One day during the week I know they have a $10 burger and beer special...why wouldn't you try it out.  Happy to have this place in my backyard.",

I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner from start to finish.  As far as the service went, our waitress Elizabeth was excellent.  I am one to ask 20 questions about the food and she was patient and provided great explanations and recommendations on everything.  The service could not have been better.  As far what we tried, it was all great.  The beer selection was outstanding, I got to try the Stella Cidre which was really good.  We started with the bacon wrapped date appetizer.  Very flavorful.  My boyfriend had the fish & chips plate which was a HUGE amount of food for $13.  I had the mushroom risotto dish and it was amazing.  He kept eating my food.  It was risotto balls that are excellent with several different types of mushrooms.  The flavor was great.  It wasn't a healthy vegetarian dish but it was outstanding.  I think I will be craving this dish on occasion.  I don't know how we managed to eat dessert too, but the pumpkin cranberry bread pudding was really tasty.  I was pleasantly surprised after reading the mixed reviews.  I am so glad I gave this place a chance.  I will definitely be back!!!  OH yeah, I read a review about cheesy pop music playing and we did not experience that.  When we were there it was good music in the background with matching videos on some TVs and football on others.  There was some fun 80s music with some radiohead, modest mouse and music like that thrown in.",

It made sense and the hostess said it would be a 25 min wait. We decided to wait.   Almost 1.5 hours past and our buzzer still hadn't gone off. People coming in after us were getting sat before us. It was becoming very frustrating. We finally complained to the hostesses and they said they forgot about us. It is very unlikely because we were standing in front of the hostess stand the whole time.   The server was lovely. She did a great job. The chef's can cook there. It is just sad that an experience that could have been very positive was very negative and it is all blamed on the hostesses (one of them being a manager in a purple dress).",

Drinks were fine, nothing memorable.   The service was attentive but maybe a little over eager. I asked to have the salmon entree modified to be served gluten-free and, after a quick trip to the kitchen, I was told that wouldn't be a problem at all. However ... when I ordered dessert - a pudding, or so I thought, it might have been nice to have been given a heads up that what I ordered was totally not gluten-free. Most people are gluten-free for the entire meal, not just the main course. My mistake but still ... silly.",

Our waitress did not check on us throughout the meal and then asked us if we could close our tab early because she was leaving her afternoon shift-- we had planned on more drinks after dinner. I watched as another couple had to flag someone down to get their check and then later watched a couple one sit down at a dirty table. This place has a great outdoor patio and view of the city.

Definitely a place with no compromise on the quality of service. Highly Recommended. PS, don't forget the short rib grilled cheese sandwiches and the excellent habanero stout beer they have",

I have been a couple of other times and the food has been bad every time. I want to like this place- the atmosphere is good, the waitress was nice (although she didn't seem to care about the disaster of a sandwich when I mentioned it), the fries were good, and they have a good beer selection, but the food has been consistently bad from my experience. It is kind of pricey for the food to be that bad. Peculiar Rabbit PLEASE fix your food- you can do better!",

I brought friends from out of town specifically to eat there and enjoy the view. With an empty restaurant we were told 35-40 min wait. When we asked why she explained that 3 very large parties had just been seated at the same time so we would have to wait. She then said the kitchen couldnt handle what they had. We offered to just sit and wait at a table and have some brunch cocktails but we were not allowed. She actually gave us the name of a restaurant we could walk to because \"she just didnt know if the restaurant could handle any more people today\". WTH. Who does that. We left. Our brunch at zada janes was amazing and the people were much nicer.",

    "text": "Had a 7:45 reservation. Got there and they said if we wanted the rooftop it would be about 30 minutes. No problem, we'll go have a drink and wait.  Almost an hour later when we inquired about our table they said the table was ready but the kitchen was running 20 min behind. Finally got seated. The waiter then also expressed that the kitchen was behind. Ordered 2 starters immediately since we were starving. It's was now after 9:00! Finally got our staters at around 9:35. Then proceeded with our meals. Mediocre at best. Definitely not worth the wait. I suggest stopping for a drink on the rooftop on your way to dinner somewhere else.",

It wasn't the traditional pie he grew up eating in the UK.   Our second visit we ate around 10pm at night, I had the chicken and waffles and my husband a burger.  Chicken was over cooked/dry with a really dark almost burnt skin, and the waffle cold.  Our waiter was indifferent to our complaint about the food. The food is inconsistent,better places in the neighborhood to try.",
