Although with traffic on Independence, the one in Elizabeth wouldn't take much longer to get to. This place is brand spanking new and was nearly spotless.   The staff was extremely friendly, including the manager who stopped at my table twice to make sure everything was good. The nachos I ordered were HUGE. I would say they were piled high to almost the height of a basketball. And at $6.95 including protein, they were a a steal - had enough to take home for a second meal.   There's the reliable salsa bar with several good choices and my favorite which has pineapple in it. They don't have alcohol yet, but the craft beer and cocktails should make an excellent addition when available for those that go at night.   The other positive was the kitchen is a little more closed, so you don't end up smelling like tacos the rest of the day. Look forward to visiting again soon, when I feel brave enough to take on Union Co. Traffic.",

It is an authentic tasting Latin food. Has a similar feel to Chipotle, but do I dare say is better? I certainly like it better than Chipotle, they also have more choices and they have authentic queso! The prices are in line with Chipotle as well, which makes this our replacement since it's right down the street from us. Lastly, the customer service was great, very attentive to customers and eager to please. You have a new customer! Thanks Sabor.",

We split the nachos (wow - what a deal!) and a burrito. We had SO MUCH FOOD! The portion size is ridiculous. We could have just shared the nachos and been full...but why stop there?  We chose two kinds of salsa from the salsa bar (pineapple / habanero, and another tomato one that was supposed to be hot). The salsa seemed flat and almost bland. We were expecting a lot of flavor after reading the names. If you are familiar with Flaming Amy's in Wilmington, this salsa bar and its contents do not compare.  The beer selection was decent - they had Belle's Two Hearted in cans and a pretty good selection of Mexican beers. They also had some local cans (NoDa's Cavu and two Unknown beers).  The atmosphere was ok - we were two of maybe six in there all together. It's small, you order from a digital menu board, and the staff was friendly. It's like fast food Latin-style, with beer.  My take: it was good, not great. I'm probably not going to be craving it any time soon, but wouldn't rule out going back there for a quick cheat meal (definitely the nachos). I'd recommend trying it for yourself, though.",

We ordered the veggie empanada, a vegetarian yuca nacho thing, and a meat taco for my hubby. There was MORE than enough food for the 3 of us and everything was delicious. The yuca was perfectly cooked and the empanada had a lovely cheesy interior (i wish there was more filling though). The nacho thingy was listed on the menu with sauteed cabbage, but ours was not sauteed and it added a nice crunch (but made it tricky to eat).   The only complaint I have is: part way through our meal the volume to the music got really loud in the restaurant which made it difficult to hold a conversation.",

    "text": "Thank you, Indian Trail, for finally having more locally owned restaurants with variety - some of us are tired of seeing the \"chains\" that are going up on Independence lately.  I truly enjoy this restaurant in the Elizabeth neighborhood and was super excited to see this going up in IT. The BYO Burrito was the BEST I've had in a long time - and hands down beats anything from Chipotle, Qdoba, Moes, Salsaritas, etc. Thanks for also offering a craft beer selection - good to see the locals (NoDa & Unknown) in there, too. The only drawback to the IT location is that the decor and atmosphere feels a bit stale - unlike the Elizabeth location. Keep slingin' awesome food!",

My only knock is that some items could be cheaper, but we're not in Tijuana so I get that a novelty street food concept in NC can never be as cheap as real street food south of the border.

He being a Chipotle fanatic wasn't swayed, but thought it was a solid alternative. The seasonings were the tie breaker. My daughter had the children's chicken taco meal with the half ear of corn. Nice hearty meal with shredded cheese for a topping. I had the shredded chicken empanada with yuca fries. My meal ended up being the family favorite. Perfectly crisp, not greasy or soggy. Another nice bonus is the free salsa bar ranging from mild, sweet or spicy.  Overall everyone was able to find something satisfying without having to try to navigate a huge menu that other Latin restaurants are guilty of. Kid-friendly with a solid kids menu, high chairs, and changing tables in the bathroom. Seating is limited, but food arrives fast so tables open quickly.",

My standing order is typically a Gordita, Empanada, Yuca, and Elote Loca, oh and a Mexican coke - you know those tall bottles of Coke with the white label - the BEST!  Of course my eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I end up taking a bunch home as left overs.  If you have only had Taco Bell as your Mexican food experience then please don't argue with Sabor that their Gordita is not a Gordita.  Sabor has it RIGHT!  Think of a homemade corn masa cake that is cut from the top and stuffed with pure deliciousness.  The Empanada dough is crisp yet flaky and chewy, and drips of cheese.  The Elote Loca is an ear of corn lightly spread with mayo instead of butter, has crumbled cheese on top and then has seasoning sprinkled on top.  Sabor's menu is a la carte, but has a little something for everyone!  Is anyone hungry yet?",

Chips cost extra but it's only $1.50 versus $3.25 at Chipotle. The salsa bar caters to 3-4 different levels of spice  like my Mom says, if it doesn't make you sweat, it ain't hot enough. They've got salsa that will spark joy (and fire) into your taste buds. If you haven't yet tried Sabor, I highly recommend giving any one of their tacos a try ($3 per taco isn't bad). The only downside is the size of the restaurant. Too small for the volume of business around dinner hours. However, it's a quick and easy way to please your family if you choose to order everyones dinner online on your way home from work.",

Everyone liked what they ordered:  * Gordita (My complaint was that I couldn't get a bite that had everything - I had to eat the lettuce and cheese first; then the meat; then the beans. Other shops can build their Gorditas so everything's evenly spread out like in a burrito, just saying.) * Protein bowl * American tacos * Chicken tenders  About $45 with a 15% tip, which is what I usually add when it's not proper table service.",

I lived in Houston for a few years so perhaps I'm biased, but I tried the corn and it was bland: there was seasoning; however, the mayo was piled high that you could hardly taste anything - even after I added more seasoning. Not a fan, I'll stick to the authentic Latin flavors found in HOU.  Update: I've tried the fries topped with steak, avocado, and a few other toppings... boy oh boy! It was yummy! The steal was well seasoned. Definitely a must try! Did I mention the drinks? Get that, too.",

    "text": "Do you eat your feelings? Do you have a LOT of feelings? Then, boy, have I got a place for you!  At Sabor, the food is inexpensive, flavorful, and comes in large portions. The employees seem to skew very young, but are always in good spirits and have provided pleasant service. The location is unfortunate, and without a proper vestibule, outside air blasts in every time the door is opened. If you're visiting on a nice day, it's not an issue, but in poor weather it can get uncomfortable.   You've probably seen Sabor's nachos on a handful of \"Best of Charlotte\" lists, and for good reason. I've tried them with shredded chicken and with ground beef; both come scattered atop a mountain of hot, crispy chips and are a real crowd-pleaser. And, really, bring a crowd. The amount of nachos you get for $9 is astounding.   The gorditas are messy, but they're tasty and filling. They don't make a good sharing dish, so get one all for yourself.   Sabor's tacos may be authentic, but compared to everything else I've tried, they aren't as packed with flavor. I've dribbled fresh lime juice and various salsas over shredded chicken tacos and they just don't stack up for me. If you're looking for a healthier option, these may be a good pick. If you, like me, are about sour cream and guacamole and cheese, skip these.   The plantains may not look like much when they're dropped off at your table, but they're always piping hot and perfectly sweet. Try 'em with a bit of queso fresco for a great flavor combination.   Are you still reading? If so, you've earned my best tip: get an elote. Get several elotes. All the elotes. They're the best kind of street food! Seriously -- don't fill up on the nachos. Get a smothered cob of corn and tear into it with reckless abandon. Have a napkin at the ready.",

I also ordered the burrito but I wish the filling was more evenly packed (the guacamole, pico de Gallo, and sour cream were all at the bottom while the first half was rice, protein, and some lettuce). My mother ordered two tacos with shredded chicken and grilled chicken. Definitely preferred the shredded chicken because the grilled chicken was too dry.   Overall, the restaurant is clean and provides ample space for dine in. Check out the pineapple habernero (my favorite of their sauces)!",

I was headed back to Charlotte from Marshville today and on the drive back I was debating on what to get for lunch. As soon as I saw the Sabor sign from the edge of Hwy 74 my mind was made up.  Since I frequent the NoDa and Pineville restaurant, I have a good idea of what I want. I usually get tacos, Locos Al Pastor with a side of queso. Since today is national burrito day I decided to try something new and how could you go wrong with \"Sabor Especial Burrito?\" My girlfriend was with me and she got a Locos Taco and an Empanada.  We got seated and when the food arrived I was blown away at the size of this burrito. You get to choose your protein (I got Al Pastor Pork) rice and beans. I thought just getting one menu item was going light but they give it to you hot and heavy! Great seasoning on the pork, crisp veggies, wonderful rice. What a homage to the holiday!  I'm feeling a little under the weather so I opted not to steal a bite of Krissy's empanada, the fry on the outside and filling inside looked great and she had no complaints. The Locos Taco is exactly what I'd expect from any other location.  Fast AND friendly, the manager not only took our order but also served it and stopped by our table twice to see how everything was. I can dig it! What's better is that everything from the tables, to the drink station, even the restrooms were squeaky clean.  It might have been nice to have a special for National Burrito Day (they did have some special, as they do for every day of the week), but considering that they're going for authentic it's probably for the best. I'd bet my last dollar that this \"Holiday\" was created by some national restaurant exec who needed to sell sell sell more burritos.  It's always a pleasure to see a True local chain not only thriving, but taking root all throughout the area. I hear there are plans for more locations in the works and I'm all for it. Can't wait to see where I'll be eating delicious Sabor Tacos next!",

Well I went inside and they denied my service and said they were closing. I'm not one to comfort people, especially at a place I enjoy eating at, so this is why I'm posting it here. Very unprofessional of a business to have employees that treat people the way they did with me. They had plenty of time to fix something for me.",

Had a chicken empanada & street Mexican corn on the cob, made it a combo, which came with bottomless chips (just came out of the cooker - nice & warm). Good selection of salsas at their salsa bar, mild to hot. Food was excellent, service team was friendly and helpful. Will go back for sure, might make it a regular lunch stop as our lunch order came out pretty quick.",

Luckily I looked at the menu ahead of time on Yelp!  I walked in to just a few tables in use, in a long skinny unit.  The kitchen takes up the right-side while dining, a salsa bar, and the beverage machine take up most of the left.  As I arrived our food came out quickly and was delivered to our table.  I had the protein bowl with grilled chicken and my friend had gotten talked into the night's special of an Arepa and an Empanada both with shredded chicken.  My protein bowl was delicious and while it came with pico on it, I added both the pineapple habanero (delicious, but sneaks up on you) and mild salsas to it as well from the salsa bar. I would highly recommend this place to anyone with a hankering for latin food!  While I didn't try my friend's, they certainly looked delicious and the empanada was a good size.",

The chicken was a little dry but it was really good and satisfying especially with the rosa sauce. I always get extra onions which I think is a extra 10-20 cents per taco. Definitely worth it and worth trying.",

We ordered nachos with steak and carne asada fries, among a few other things. The nachos arrived first with the steak so burnt that it was literally crunchy in my mouth. Several minutes later the carne asada fries arrived with the same burnt steak and no queso. It was explained that there was an accident in the back and more queso had to be made but they would bring us a side dish once it was ready. Unfortunately, they got busy and the queso never arrived. I hope the issues are isolated to this visit at this location because we truly love sabor and visit other locations regularly. We won't be back to the IT location.",

I personally really like the Empanadas. Build Your Own Bowl (BYOB) is also a great option. They have healthier options as well such as quinoa.   The thing Sabor does well is to keep the menu concise. One mistake made by many restaurants is to overload the menu with too many options. Especially being a newer restaurant chain, I think Sabor will continue to expand with a smaller menu.   This place keeps the food really fresh; I actually witnessed a supplier bring in fresh vegetables. The chips here are excellent and they have five different sauces. The green monster was spicy but delicious. I put it on my bowl and it was perfect addition.",

    "text": "If you need spicy, delectable fortification for the drive along the future I-74, swing into Sabor for a bite!   This quick-casual restaurant specializes in street food handhelds like empanadas and arepas, but their more utensil-dependent options are equally as scrumptious. From quinoa avocado bowls with roasted veggies to yuca fries smothered in cheese and seasoned steak, you can truly not go wrong with any of the entrees or sides presented.  The tortilla chips here are excellent--sturdy, dusted with a top-secret spice blend that sets them apart from all others you've tried at those other restaurants. While you wait for your entree, grab some salsa cups and peruse the salsa bar at the back, which has excellent choices in a range of capsaicin levels. I adore the Arbol and Pineapple Habanero, but highly suggest you test your mettle with them all.  The guacamole and queso are also delicious, and you can order a side portion or enough for the whole group (though you will fight for it, so let the chip-bumping commence!).  Burritos are very popular here, with options to build your own burrito or else choose from their carefully crafted selections. My favorite burrito is the El Dominicano. It's a delicious departure from the typical protein-bean-rice formula, featuring shredded chicken and seasoned cabbage and veggies. All the burritos are stuffed with goodies and flat-grilled, so you may want to bib up and save yourself the grief of a soiled shirt. You'll certainly receive no judgment from me! (Three unfolded napkins should do, btw)  Sabor also keeps in mind dietary concerns and features delicious vegetarian as well as gluten-free options. They even worked with Fitness Hero to create entrees with healthy substitutions that never compromise on the flavor.  Customer service is also exceptional--Tom and Hailey saw to my every need and made my dining experience that much more enjoyable with their help and humor.   Overall, an excellent choice for a quick meal or take out or even delivery through Postmates. I'm already looking on Yelp for Sabor locations slightly closer to home, but rest assured I will be back to this location any time I'm in the area if only for the superb service received here.  Thanks again and enjoy, y'all :-)",

The smell of the chicken just bothered me, idk might be the cheese/sauce combo, did not eat. The veggie empanada was, well I would not order again, the shell was tasty but the same weird cheese, saturated in cheese and bits of veggies, too greasy for my taste. Now the Burrito was ok...ish, too Salty, low quality in my opinion, 100% of all of us there prefer Chipotle. Now comes the Elote Loco, ugh, corn tasted old, dressed up with tons of mayo, cheese, chile to mask it, i feel. The yuca fries were, nice, pretty yummy. The drinks and yuca fries where why they got two stars if not 0. That's the way meow see's it.",

There were only three tables with guests and 4 people behind the counter (one dishwasher, someone prepping for dinner, one cook and a cashier who was doing nothing more than pacing behind the counter).  The lone cook was preparing one item at a time instead of working a full ticket at a time or the same item from multiple tickets at the same item (all three tables ordered nachos that required nothing more than making three piles of chips and throwing prepared toppings on them).  The prepper nor the cashier pitched in to help expedite or prepare orders.  I can't imagine the wait times during peak hours.  This place won't be here long.  I miss Genaro's :-(",

The chicken empanada had a lot of cooking oil dripping from it and it was 25% chicken and 75% air.  I had empanadas in Puerto Rico so I know what they are supposed to look & taste like if they are home-made and made properly.  You pay at the counter \"BEFORE\" you see the food. They turn the cash register monitor around for you to sign AND the screen will show you recommended tips to add to the bill.  Of course you will feel compelled to add a tip even though you have not received any food or service. Both empanadas came on a single metal plate so we had to share the plate.   As a Hispanic, I was expecting some authentic \"Latin Sabor\" (flavor) but we walked out very disappointed.",

This location has the same menu but it was missing a few things that we loved about the Elizabeth location.  The ambiance just wasn't the same which I think effected our overall enjoyment of the meal.  The location was very clean but it just felt more fast food vs the latin flair of the other location from the decor to the music.  The food wasn't the same (point for Elizabeth).  The flavors were similar but the presentation and amount of accompaniments were not the same (another point for Elizabeth).   The food just tasted and looked better at Elizabeth.  We will definitely go to sabor Latin Street Grill again, but we will go to the Elizabeth location as it is overall the stronger restaurant.",
