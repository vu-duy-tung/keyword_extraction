    "text": "Down from Northern Virginia, and of the discerning palate, we decided to turn to Yelp to identify a decent place to grab dinner downtown.  Relying on Adam D.'s review, we decided to try Mimosa Grill, which was within blocks of our hotel ALOFT.  We were surprised that the place was relatively empty on a Friday night.  But the decor was beautiful, and we were seated immediately.  Greeted by a friendly and helpful waiter, we quickly ordered a mojito that hit the spot.  Upon the recommendation of Adam D., we started off with the hushpuppies, followed by the scallops and the filet.    The hushpuppies had just the slightest kick to them, and we loved the crawfish and the sauce.  The bread basket contained warm yummy biscuits and cornbread with apricot butter.  Next came our entrees.  The star of this party was the mesquite grilled filet, which was cooked to perfection atop a grit cake.  I could tell that my husband was incredibly envious, so I gave him half.  His scallops were good but paled in comparison to the filet.  Before I forget, we also ordered the grilled zucchini and squash.  They were excellent.    On a high from our amazing dinner, we decided to share the trio of creme brulee.  Sadly, the dessert fell short.  Otherwise I would have given Mimosa Grill 5 stars.   Although very edible, we could barely differentiate between the three flavors - lemon, ginger and pistachio.  In summary, Mimosa Grill is a must try for anyone who appreciates southern fair with a dash of sophistication.",

    "text": "Went with a group of 10 people for Charlotte Restaurant week. (twice a year you can try some of Charlotte's best restaurants 3 courses for 30$) Mimosa prides themselves on being a Farm to Table restaurant. So thats why we chose Mimosa. If you like vodka and ginger beer you must try the Moscow Mule. It came served in a nice copper mug. This was sooo good, I could have easily drank 5 more. LOL. My meal started with the lobstah mac n cheese. This was loaded with big pieces of lobster and creamy cheesy mac. I felt like it might be a bit too buttery (yes buttery) as what I had left was huge pool of it in the bottom of my dish when i was done. My friend had a hummus plate and it was probably the best hummus I had ever had. That appetizer was a winner! I also had the Short Rib as my entree. This is very much like an updated version of beef and noodles (which is my go-to comfort food)The Ramen noodles tasted homemade and the broth with the veg was delish. The beef was very tender. For dessert I had the pecan pie. It was a small tart with a dollop on maple tasting icecream. Very refreshing. The only thing negative I would say that some people in my party ordered extra sides or apps and they came out at different times then us ordering just 3 courses. So therefore we had finished our entree and others had'nt even gotten theirs yet. Awkward service. Hence the reason I only gave this 4 stars.  Overall we would go back again as the food was fresh and yummy.",

There is also no limit to how many mini plates you can order. Its all included in the price:) Also noteworthy was the mac and cheese, green beans, sausage gravy and biscuits, various cheeses, glazed ham and heavenly dessert selection complete with chocolate covered strawberries. A few of the breakfast staple items on the buffet were just ok. A bit better bacon would earn them 5 stars from me.  Still, I say it would  be a damn shame to go somewhere like Ihop, when for a few bucks more you can have an epic brunch here.",

    "text": "****** 4.5 stars *****  One of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \"great\" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.  I really like the \"upscale Southern\" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.  Whether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!",

Minding my own business, I invited my daughter and a friend of hers whilst on a business trip in North Carolina to sup with me (they are at Belmont Abbey nearby). I love my daughter (Rosa Maria - aka, Bobo, Bobes, the Bobester, Rosiropasucia, <a href=\"mailto:bobes@ropasucia.NET\">bobes@ropasucia.NET</a>, etc.) - there, just had to say it. Mariana came along as well and was a delight - PLUS, she is over 21 so we were able to KILL a bottle of wine together! Lots of good, local food (I love that whole local thang) and a server who was good if not fastidious in making sure that my underage daughter (19) didn't get served alcohol.  I understand, but...  Anyway, why 3 stars? It took FOREVER to get seated and the place was not packed - I guess they were shorthanded, but man!  Then, after FOREVER to get our food, I got the wrong item.  By this point, it was late and I still had to drop the girls off and drive up to Greensboro, so I ate what they brought.  I got a credit for my meal, but it's important to do these kind of things right if it's an upscale restaurant, right?  Anyway, yes, I'll go back.  I'll also make sure that they are properly staffed and that I make reservations.",

As many of the yelp reviews suggest, we started out with the lobster mac and cheese which was pretty good. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about but the lobster was awesome, and they didn't skimp on it which I appreciate. My boyfriend and I got the salmon and the trout special (?) which weren't anything to write home about. I honestly felt like I could have made something similar at home. Also, the trout special was wayyyyy oversalted. My boyfriend literally would lick salt off of a plate (gross, I know), and he even thought it was too salty.

The bad - staff was not personable, felt rushed and understaffed (I ate at the bar, where one bartender covered all the lounge booths by the bar (8), bar seats and making the drinks for everyone else). I know it can be better because her attitude towards the friends / employees also eating at the bar, manager and waitstaff was much better/friendlier/more relaxed than to the customers, although I feel for her and the amount of work expected.  The other - the decor was a little dated and the staff was pushy and pretentious, example would be serving hot tea and plates to customers ordering, interrupting and telling the customers to watch out they are hot (as opposed to waiting for the order to be taken and then serving.

We drove 1 hr. to eat here because this was were my wife wanted to go. Never Again! . Wife & I have traveled the World. Longhorn or any number of establishments are better at half the price.",

    "text": "Had my birthday dinner here with a group of 13 and it was great! Service was prompt, portion sizes are ridiculously big and the food was tasty.   Started out with the lobster mac and cheese (delish), some ordered salads and my mom ordered the sausage flatbread (delish). Soooo, the chef sent out my mom's flatbread and 5 minutes later the waitress comes back with another one, a bigger one! Compliments of the chef bc he thought the first one wasn't big enough (looked big & good to me lol). Now that's customer service.   Entrees varied and all were pretty good! Hubs wasn't a big fan of the short rib entree. The potatoes that came with my trout was pretty sweet like maple. Overall,  everything else was pretty good, especially the appetizers and small plates! Great atmosphere, great food and great service! Will definitely return! Thanks for a great birthday dinner Mimosa Grill!",

He even took it in stride when I called him by the wrong name (Alejandro).  :)  We both had the pecan crusted trout, which was very good.  Had the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert which was also very good.  Definitely recommend... Even better is that if you are staying at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn, you can ride the free shuttle there and back (provided by the hotel).",

Sat in a nice outdoor area, though I would have been nicer if they had used nicer tables.  - Service (5/5) Very quick, very courteous, very professional.  - Springer Mountain Fried Chicken, $24 (4/5) Really good flavor from the brown sugar sauce on the outside of the chicken, though I wish it had permeated a bit better.  Certain parts of the chicken were very flavorful, and other areas had less flavor.  All in all, a really nice (and hefty) piece of fried chicken.  The toast it came on soaked up all the goodness and was oozing with flavor.    - Southern Braised Greens, $6 (4/5) Great flavor, though I found the greens themselves to be a bit tough.    - Blackout Chocolate Cake, $8 (4/5) Good cake, though could have been a bit more moist.  The banana was a very good complement.  - Value (3/5) On the surface, the prices are pretty reasonable, but that piece of fried chicken ought to be a bit less expensive, and the braised greens also were a bit overpriced for the portion.  - Final Word All in all, a tasty meal.",

I will say that 3 green beans is not worthy of saying that there are green beans with the fish . Lol. The banana pudding was good but not the best I've ever had. (The best banana pudding is at tupelo honey).  Warning. We came here on a Sunday night before a performance at the knight theatre and they were not prepared for us. They made us wait for a table for 10 Minutes because they just sat a bindi of folks and they wanted to space out the orders to the kitchen. The kitchen had no trouble with our meals, but I did see other tables getting served where half their table got their entree 10 minutes after the others at their table. And our wine order came after we finished our meal. Very odd experience. I felt bad for the waiter and I could tell that he was stressed . No comps for the issues either.   I would still come again though even with the issues.",

Mimosa Grill has found a way to answer all of these dilemmas. The shrimp and cheesy grits (with Moscow Mule) was a lunch for the ages. The presentation? Gorgious. There is a generous amount of shrimp- not just a skimpy amount lost in the cheesy grits as you might fear-all for $14.   But, you might say, I hate shrimp. Fear not, the chicken wednesday special was also amazing. A unique spice blend on the chicken skin that was finger licking good.  In summary: make this place your next food stop. Your loved ones will love you more, your business partners will marvel at your food acumen.",

It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu , I questioned it then said no thank you . So my gf orders the oysters 6/$15 , after a long wait they bring them out and they are gulf oysters .

LOOOOOOOOVE.  i came here during happy hour on my trip to take boards in charlotte. came solo, sat at a table at the bar and pretended to look busy. had a great glass of pinot grigio, and decided to order up a storm, as i thought appetizers would be small.  uhm, but they are NOT. no wonder the server looked at me like i was crazy when i ordered. haha. got the wild mushroom flatbread. it was amaaaaaaaaaaaazing. so freakin good. and huge.  i also got the mussel bowl - which actually comes out in a HUGE freakin mountain in it's own cast iron bowl. and is amazing. so. delicious.   and blt sliders. what the freak. you HAVE to get one of these. oh, what the heck. get more than one!!!! pork belly? fried green tomatoes?!?!?!?! SO PERFECTLY DELECTABLE. get it. get it. get it.  the perfect pre-boards meal. i had to finish the mussels, so i brought the entire flatbread home with me. and the total for my meal? it was like... $20 with tip? if you go early during happy hour, it's even CHEAPER than the listed prices. what in the world. huge screamin' deal AND delicious? how often does that happen?",

I ordered the Rock House Farm Artisan Pork, which turned out to be teeny slices of unseasoned chewy pork loin layered with collard greens, some mac and cheese, a cube of fried pork belly with a greasy dab of something they call Arkansas black apple sauce. The collard greens were great, and the mac and cheese were great, but the rest was not worth eating.  All for $27.  Folks, pork loin is not expensive, and should always be tender and bountiful.  And don't give me a cube of fried pork belly and call it braised smokey bacon.  The Arkansas black apple sauce makes me never want to go to Arkansas.  The two stars are based on the nice decor and excellent service.  But the food was not so great.",

Our waitress was nice but I'm 90% sure she was super hungover. She disappeared for about a half hour and we contemplated leaving without paying just because we were waiting so long for the check. For food, I tried the papperdelle, which was the first time I ever had it, but it reminded me of the noodles you would get in a pad si-ew. It was wonderfully done with the fennel and and mushroom. My boyfriend got the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly and came with some nice fries on the side. The prices are a little on the high side considering the small portions, but it's in a great location and a good place to stop in for a bite while exploring Charlotte.",

    "text": "The most memorable part of my experience at Mimosa Grill was the house-made pimiento cheese. Served in a ramekin, warm and gooey with crusty bread and celery, the dish was tangy and sumptuous. Even my boyfriend enjoyed it, and he does not like pimiento cheese.  Mimosa Grill has a stunning interior--dark wood with soft lighting and brick accents--reminiscent of a bygone era of three martini lunches, but without any hint of retro kitsch. In that way it's modern, impeccably melding comfort and aesthetics. Mimosa Grill is just as well-suited for Easter brunch as it is for a bachelorette party.  Initially we ordered the daily lunch special, short ribs, but they were out. We were out for a late lunch, around 2 PM, but I still found it strange to run out of the special. The entrees we settled on were a wild mushroom flatbread and a cheeseburger. The flatbread was nice and the mushrooms very fresh, but the flavors were a bit one-note. My boyfriend found his burger overcooked.   Our server appeared distracted, even though we initially were the only diners. When a group of young women came in they sat them in the booth closest to ours. Considering the restaurant is GINORMOUS, I was frustrated. My boyfriend and I were obviously on a date, and we would have felt that our experience was a priority to Mimosa Grill if the server had simply acknowledged us by valuing our privacy and seating the young women elsewhere.  As one of the ubiquitous high-end Southern restaurants popping up all over Charlotte, and the South in general, Mimosa Grill offers a gorgeous setting. Hopefully the food and service will catch up soon.",

I sat at the bar and while there was nothing that my server failed to do, he was more focused on providing prompt service throughout and did not bother introducing himself at any point. Had their crabs eggs bene dish and while it was pretty tasty overall, the crab cake mix was a bit too heavy for me. I had a mimosa and hot tea to accompany my meal and the check came out to $28 and change - pretty decent value. Apparently, it is a Charlotte staple that has been in operation for over 25 years and I plan to return to try their other dishes.",

    "text": "We didn't expect Charlotte to be such an enjoyable city. So that was a surprise--as has been the food, the service and the friendliness of everyone we have come in contact with during our visit.   And Mimosa Grill was another example of a high quality food/service experience. We had lunch there, starting with a delicious ramekin of warmed pimento cheese followed by Sandra's hanger steak with truffle fries (you could smell the oil from a distance, so hope you enjoy truffle oil--Food Network judges notwithstanding!) and me with a beautiful iron skillet salmon accompanied by a wonderful blend of sauteed vegetables.   Sandra was uncertain which Chardonnay she wanted, and no sooner did she express her indecision than two tastings appeared at the table. She was not disappointed.   Matthew was our server and he was exceptionally--and appropriately--attentive to our questions and the timing of our food.   Not to mention the outdoor setting, of which there are many in downtown Charlotte. In fact, that's one of things we have been surprised and enjoyed about this city: lots of high rise offices and residences downtown, however pleasantly walkable with a number of green spaces and places to just sit down and talk, or have a cup of coffee, or enjoy your lunch. There is a certain vibrancy that has struck us in such a positive way. Not a defining character like Savannah or Charleston, but a business center that has livable characteristics that actually encourage you to walk and enjoy a bit.   We are optimistic to continue our journey here and suspect we will not be disappointed. Mimosa Grill is one more gem in Charlotte's crown.",

There is a full bar which also has tables on a first come first serve basis. I dined with a large group. We had a limited menu and I can speak for at least 10 of us by saying Mimosa Grill did not disappoint. The servers were on point! They worked together to make sure our food arrived promptly, empty plates were removed immediately, drinks filled instantaneously and constantly asked if there was anything else we desired...all done with a smile. Mimosa Grill is fine dining. The table top tea lights, linen napkins and gorgeous view really set a great tone for an evening out.   *Food synopsis:  Cream cauliflower soup  Lobster Mac & Cheese (don't leave w/o it) Stuffed hush puppies with shrimp, clams  Fried green tomatoes Salad with parsnips, tomato, Asiago, vinaigrette  Grilled chicken & fingerling potatoes (I sub'd for green beans)  Salmon & sauteed veggies  Fruit cobbler  Cheesecake   *Rating for all above items:  Whopping 5/5 Stars on the Christy Scale.",

They weren't too busy and we were seated in this nice enclosed patio area (inside with the air conditioning, but had glass windows all around so you can look outside).   My coworker got the iron skillet roasted salmon and said it was just okay. She also had very fibrous pieces of artichokes on her dish which wasn't edible. However, I ordered the pecan crusted NC Mountain trout and really enjoyed it. It came with mashed yukon potatoes, green beans, peach chutney, and honey-lemon butter. The dish came with two pieces of trout topped over the mashed potatoes and green beans. I really like the pecan crusted fish because it gave the fish a nice nutty aroma. I also really like the honey-lemon butter. You can taste the slight sweetness from the honey, but it doesn't overpower the flavors  at all. The pecan crust and honey butter was a great combination on the fish.   Service was good and the trout was delicious!",

Hollowed our hush puppies filled with leeks langastino and crab.  They are smothered in a cheese sauce and served with a duo of sauce.  Them for the meal had the flank steak but sub the potato for spicy broccoli. It was amazing and had enough heat to make me warm.  The steak was amazingly seasoned and tender.",

We wouldn't see him for 15mins at a time, noticed all other tables had bread...we didn't, never really checked in on how our food was. He also told us wrong things about the menu.  As for the food, price does not fit the quality or size. We ordered a salad and the cheese plate for appetizer... It was average. I got the short rib which was really good. Perfect size for  female small for a guy. My husband got the pork and was ok. The server said the portion was larger for that dish... Not at all, less food than me and had 3 gnocchi on the plate.  Dessert, I got the silk pie and it was ok, the crust was kinda odd, too much peanuts or whatever they used in it. My husband got the pecan pie and he liked it.  We don't plan to returning. Bad service, expensive food that's average at most.",

We had 1 person greet us to tell us she wouldn't be our server but got our drinks.  1 person simply sat our mimosas on the table and didn't speak.  The 3rd person who was not our server finally explained the menu options.  Our server finally showed up at that point we had already looked at the buffet and would have preferred an a la carte option. He then recommended a place down the street that stopped serving brunch at 12noon...  It was 12 at that point. And for the finale a different person actually brought us the bill for the mimosas we ordered....  Overall poor service. Not coming back.",

With that said, the restaurant was nice - good location and great ambience. My pecan pie was delicious as well - it came with an ice cream that tasted of bourbon. Very nice pairing.   I got there as happy hour was finishing up, but it seemed like it was the place to be for local finance execs.",

I could have just spent the whole meal eating those but couldn't because I still had so much more to try. And the only item I would not get again was the Apple salad.

He said the kitchen was recovering from the previous hour or so. Just what you want to hear when you arrive! -_- He didn't offer anything other than water and alcohol. He was basically like, \"I'll get you some water and here is the drink list\". He greeted us - left. Gave us the drink menu - left. Gave us water - left. Told us the specials - left. Gave us an update on our appetizers - left. Gave me my drink - left. FINALLY received our appetizers - left. FINALLY took our order - left. (That was about 30 minutes in itself.) Cue 25 minutes after that - finally received our entrees. He was still very professional and kind throughout the entire meal. It wasn't even a super busy night either. The four tables closest to us were all on desserts and after-dinner drinks. I guess the kitchen staff was very slow that evening.  The food and the drink I ordered were so mediocre it's ridiculous. My boyfriend and I ordered the lobster mac & cheese and the crab cakes for or appetizers. The crab cakes were burned a little bit, but the salad that goes along with it was amazing. The cheese mixture on the lobster mac & cheese tasted a little funny. We both ordered the NC Mountain Trout and the entire entree was mediocre as well. Which is weird because that's supposed to be one of their best entrees... I ordered the Spiced Pear drink and it was TERRIBLE. Don't try it!! I had high hopes for this place, but I would not go back again.",

There's lots of yummy food on the buffet itself, but then you can also order small plates like walnut crusted French toast with berries and/or their quiche of the day.

Make your reservation accordingly. :-)  The prime rib was the best prime rib I've ever stuffed in my gob. The horseradish cream was perfect. It's worth going just for those two items.

The meal started with the lobster mac&chz and stuffed hush puppies as appetizers. The good news were that the apps were presented well and very tasty.  The bad news is that they were the best part of the meal. The m&c had good texture and balance but was highly seasoned and both my dining partner and I felt that it was too salty. The hush puppies were spot on. Loaded with shrimp & crawfish in a delicate white sauce with toasted onion slivers. Yummy! The crispy texture of the hush puppies, paired with the creamy sauce was just perfect.  As for the entrees, well that's a whole different story. I had the short ribs with the risotto. The ribs were cooked perfectly but the risotto was crunchy ( and I don't mean al dente) which made it difficult to enjoy the meal....I'm not interested in just eating a hunk of meat.  My companion had the Red Snapper which was served over jambalaya which was also lackluster. All in all, it was just oh-Kay.   For dessert I had the apple pie cheesecake. It clearly had not been made the same day because it had developed that \"skin\" on it that comes from keeping things refrigerated but uncovered. It was not edible.    This was $100 meal that was more like a 2 for $20 deal at Chili's or TGI Friday's. If I ever go back to this place again it will be for the apps only. Save your money.",

Wait staff seemed to not be overwhelmed but for some reason took quite a bit of time to wait on the table.  Ordered 3 appetizers to start the night with.  We got the small Jambalaya, the Brussel Sprouts and the P.E.I Mussels.    The Jambalaya was great and the rock shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The rice was at a great texture and the sausage really added to the flavor profile.  Brussel Sprouts were nice and crispy, served without sale (had to add some).  Good order with them.  VERY disappointed with the Mussels.  I am from Maine and have been used to the freshness of these mussels.  The mussels were all open, but seemed to have been cooked to fast.  They were not firm, lacked flavor, and in all honesty, it seemed like I was eating a cooked clam and not a mussel.  They took the mussels off the bill which was nice, but the waiter seemed to delay any response to our table afterwards.  A manager did come to the table to see what was wrong with our order which was nice.  Could have been a 5/5 stars if the mussels were cooked fresh and properly.  Great atmosphere and quite a few quality selections to choose from on the menu.",

The cheese sauce wasn't anything spectacular just felt like a regular mac and cheese sauce. I feel this could be such a great dish but it was just okay.   My husband had the slow roasted bbq pork flatbread - it was good but a little too sweet and a little too much cheese. I KNOW... TOO MUCH CHEESE? NEVER! But seriously when it comes to pork and cheese together there is a limit. DON'T JUDGE ME!  The best part was that if you are staying at the near by Marriott then you get a discount.",

    "text": "Man, I rarely give out 5 stars...check my history you'll see...well, I'm giving Mimosa 5 stars.  I don't wanna say it's begrudgingly, but it kinda is.  I'm one of those where 'nothing is perfect and there's always room for improvement'  thank goodness I'm not a teacher.  Anywho, I'm going to go for 5 stars instead of 4 simply b/c this was the best meal hands down that I've had in Uptown since I moved here.    Better than Chima, 5 Church, Aria, that awful BBQ place I can't remember the name of..the list goes on.  Lobster mac and cheese.  Good HUGE hunks of lobster, I only ate a bite or two at the restaurant b/c it was very very creamy, and I have issues with dairy.  I know, why'd I order it...did I mention the huge hunks of lobster?  Seriously there was a whole claw that was still in tact.  I went to town on it when I got home and could verify it wasn't going to upset my stomach.  The asparagus - yum, it had a very smokey flavor.  It wasn't your standard grilled asparagus.  Finally I had the hush puppies.  This...now let's take a minute here.....it's actually a hollowed out hush puppy with a shrimp filling that is all kinds of yummy.  Oh, it was just the bee's knee's.  I'm totally doing this place a disservice with the description above b/c the hush puppies were on point.  And very unique.    Oh and for dessert, a mini pecan pie with chocolate chips.  Yummm.  Our server was also excellent.  It was just myself and a friend and we are quite chatty and so was our server.  So I liked that too.  To recap - I'm giving them 5 stars...so Mimosa Grill please don't let me down next time I visit you.",

    "text": "Mimosa!  Man, it's hard to judge this restaurant because I seem to have such highs and lows here! Nowhere in between.  I usually come here every week on Sunday morning to get at that all-you-can-eat brunch for ~$20! The food can be hit or miss at times, but the staples of crispy bacon, fried eggs and fresh mimosa never cease to amaze! Sunday brunches showcase some of this place's creativity because certain menu items (the specials, quiches and desserts) constantly change with the week and season. The food overall is just alright, but if you don't want to cook and need a lot of choice (indecisive), this is the place for you.   During the week, I come here regularly to pick up my dinner because it's close by and my workday is long. They have a great corporate menu that lets you have a $20 (tax included) dinner that comes with entree, salad and two sides. Your choice is grilled chicken, steak, or salmon with sides of fries, mashed potatoes, green beans, or spinach (can't remember the rest). I will admit, for the most part the taste is rich and delicious, but their execution is so inconsistent. Occasionally the salmon is undercooked, or the chicken charred on one side, or the mashed potatoes liquidy. And once I recieved my food 50 minutes after ordering... but more often than not, I am pleased with the efficiency and quality that I'm paying for.   I would say this is a pretty sweet spot for brunch and a convenient place to grab dinner, but don't always expect it to be \"like last time.\"  4/5",

I had the trout off the small menu, which was pretty good and surprisingly filling. Service was very good and they were attentive.  Not the restaurants fault, but some of the crowd there, apparently 'loading up' on the buffet weren't exactly quiet and respectful of others.  not sure if this is a normal sunday afternoon or not but don't think i would chance that time again both with the crowd as well as being limited to the buffet.",

I have been with the banking lunch crowd, on a dinner date, for Restaurant Week, and for Thanksgiving. Every time the food has been great! The place is known for its lobster mac & cheese, although I have never had it, the people I dine with usually get it. They put a giant lobster claw sticking out of it so it looks ready to attack your fork!  Their cocktails are very good and they have a nightly drink special so ask your server- I know with the Sunday brunch they serve $3 bellinis and mimosas.It is usually brand liquor during the drink specials too, which is an added bonus. They offer a bar bites menu too if you want a little something to go with all those cocktails.   It is a little pricey depending on what you order. This is a great place to go for a power lunch, corporate dinner, date night, drop in cocktail after Alive After Five, nice dinner if you are staying in a neighboring hotel, or place to go when your parents are in town. It's a win-win all around!",

I ordered a fried chicken dish and the chicken was undercooked. When I told our server he tried to convince me it wasn't and that it was just the sauce they put on the chicken. What?! Firstly how dare you insult my intelligence. I've been eating and cooking chicken for over 20 years, I think I know when I'm eating undercooked chicken. I'm assuming the cooks just weren't going to cook anything else bc it was late. The chicken came with Mac and cheese which was ok. My fiance had the trout and said it wasn't good. Overall the service was ok until the server blew off my complaint I had about eating undercooked chicken. That's the ultimate turn off. Won't be going there again.",

I felt that the table that my waitress was helping was getting much better service . My service was so slow , I couldn't even wait for my waitress to come back after leaving the check. I had to pull out wallet and give payment cause I couldn't wait another 20 minutes for her to come back. I will never go back.

I had the lobster mac and cheese for an appetizer which was pretty good, nothing overly impressive other than the portion size. The portion served felt like it was more than an appetizer but I wasnt complaining.  My wife on the other hand had the Georgia Stuff hush puppies and I can eat these all day. I really cant tell you what was in it other than craw fish, but the dish was spectacular. The dinner was good too. The portion was not too big, but just enough because we had appetizers and was pretty much already fool.  Overall the service was good and our dinner was good too. Highlights were the Iced tea, and the Georgia Stuff hush puppies.",

It was a bad cut with lots of gristle that I couldn't even cut through, so three sizable pieces couldn't be eaten.  The Tiramisu Chocolate Martini was with the whole trip to Charlotte!!!

They have an amazing brunch buffet that consisted of Mac n cheese, ribs, chicken, bacon, shrimp and grits and everything in between. Also included in the brunch are made to order tapas that you ask your server to bring out. The walnut crusted French toast is to die for. The place is so beautiful and upscale and if you go in the warmer months patio seating is a must. Even in the colder months they have heaters on out there but have the window covers down so can't enjoy the view of the hustle and bustle of downtown. If you're a Charlotte native and never been or visiting from out of town it is a must you hit up their brunch. Will NOT be disappointed.",

This is not a coincidence. Maria, the manager of Mimosa Grill, did not take any responsibility for this (she blamed their vendors). I warn you NOT to eat here. I hope the health department shuts them down. ***In response to the owner: the health department found that kitchen workers did not wash their hands, they were wearing jewelry, and cross contamination (there was prepared foods next to raw food).

They offer a modest selection of local Charlotte beers and 5-6 craft cocktail options.  You are served delicious mini biscuits with a honey butter while waiting. These biscuits are slightly addictive and I could see myself eating far too many. While I was really torn on the sweet potato gnocci (sounded delicious - with brussel sprouts included!), I went with the trout, served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I was able to sub brussel sprouts for the green beans, and it was a delicious decision. The trout was cooked and marinated perfectly and was a delicious choice. I would definitely order it again.  The service was great - attentive, friendly and able to modify choices as needed. I always appreciate when restaurants can make necessary modifications, because sometimes it does require more work on their part in the kitchen. I also loved the inside and the brick and stones. They have a covered patio portion as well, which is great for this spring weather in Charlotte. I will be back soon!",

    "text": "Mimosa Grill provided an excellent dinner while in Charlotte on business.  It is an upscale restaurant with a casual feel.  I love the ambiance of the place: it's lively in a quiet way.  Good for large groups or romantic couples.  The menu is compact yet offers very interesting and delicious dishes with a Southern twist.  There's a selection of small plates, soups, salads, and entres.  Their signature dish since opening in 1995 is the NC Mountain trout.  Three in our group had the trout and all loved it.  I had the spicy fried chicken which was terrific.    If you're in the mood for drinks and a little to eat, they have a very nice bar.  A great place to unwind after work.",

Wanting to get some vegetables in before all the bridal festivities (and schedule) started, I chose the kale and arugula salad to balance us out.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  We started with mimosas (not because they're the special or they have anything to do with name, but because we needed a little something and we weren't going to work), and they were a good blend of bubbles and oj.  Our food arrived in short order, and our server brought us additional plates to make splitting the items easier.  The salad was good, though slightly overdressed.  I think I'd get the dressing on the side next time.  The shrimp and grits had lots of flavor, smoke and salt.  Something made me quite thirsty in the hours following.  The grits had nice texture, there was plenty of flavorful (tomato-based) sauce, and good chunks of shrimp, sausage, and veggies.  All in all, a good fancier lunch if you're in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "So I am behind on all of my yelping and wanting to catch up. I have to spotlight Mimosa Grill as one of my spots in Charlotte especially till about June of this past year. I kid you not that I literally would go every Monday from February all the way through June pretty much because of this crazy delicious dish they had. My yelp elite homie has now reached the point of just asking if I am at my usual spot in which she is implying Mimosa Grill. This place is next to the Wells Fargo building and is tucked away near the corner Tryon and EMLK Blvd. The hostesses are always super nice along with the waitresses but the bartenders are rock solid. Especially the female bartender, I feel like she is my friend away from home and she is always so sweet in remembering my order for drinks/food.   The joint itself seems to always be busy and a popular spot for happy hours as well. I went here once with a fellow yelper and we grabbed a few plates including the tartare which was ok but the star of the show here is just so delicious. I ended up getting the wagyu flat iron steak and the side of Brussels sprouts which had bacon and an apple vinaigrette to it. I swear to god if I could eat this combo every day I would...but seriously... It is the most delicious and tender piece of meat that just bursts with flavors. The portion is just perfect and it is amazingly good. The Brussels sprouts are just fantastic and I asked to make my two sides that come with the steak to all be Brussels sprouts. That is how good this dish is. I don't even remember what else I ordered since it was just meh compared to these outstanding plates. Now unfortunately the bad news is that they got rid of the Brussels sprouts in june and while the steak is delicious I am just missing this side so bad that the experience is not the same.. and trust me ive asked if they can just make it haha.   Even with this slight hiccup this continues to be a solid spot for service, coziness, and good food. I will continue to visit when I get a chance and hope to god that these Brussels sprouts will make a repeat appearance.",

I ordered the kale and arugula salad with shrimp, and it was pretty good considering I never usually order salads at restaurants. I do wish the dressing came on the side; the leaves were almost too drenched. However the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the parsnips and radishes added a nice bitterness and crunch. The cornbread that came with it was amazing as well. I tried a few bites of the shrimp and grits though and instantly wished I had ordered that instead - SO GOOD and had more than just shrimp and grits. So if I ever come back I know what I'm getting.   The staff were all nice and so is the atmosphere and decor. A bit pricey, but within reason and well worth it.",

I ordered a chicken plate entree and it tasted like frozen battered chicken. I would not recommend this place for most part.  1. It took the waiter 5 mints to tell us they doesn't have something while we could have ordered something else. 2. Refills for water took a while too.. 3. Small menu that is overpriced. 4. Idk if anything tastes there good. 5. Took another 15 mints to get my check.  What your paying is the view. Not kid friendly since I didn't see any.",

Service was decent at best. Hard to find our server. I ordered the Wagyu, med rare. Why in the world would you smother a great cut of meat? It was literally drowning in a sauce with mushrooms and whatever else. And I wouldn't be so worried about that, if it was actually med rare. It was just under medium and burnt solid. Really disappointed this time around. Sent it back. The manager just came by to apologize which is nice. I'll be here for a few more months for work. I'll give it another go.   Update: They made it right with the filet. So good.",

But on a recent visit with business colleagues from out of town, I was pleasantly surprised by both the service and the meal. From the extensive wine selection to the delicious appetizers (the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Carolina Crab Cakes were both outstanding), the entire experience surpassed my expectations.   The Scottish Salmon I ordered for my entree was also superb, served with a wonderfully spicy salsa dressing and on a bed of risotto. And my colleagues aved about their dishes, as well, which ranged from Mountain Trout to Fried Chicken. After sharing bowls of sorbet and a warm chocolate cake for dessert, they were thoroughly impressed by the Queen City's restaurant scene, and I was thrilled I gave Mimosa Grill another chance.",

While the plating was on point,the food was generally bland. To start, we ordered the Blood Mary flight and some watermelon-tequila drink. The flight was unexciting, mediocre, and all tasted the same. The watermelon drink was ok, but not we'll balanced. Next, for appetizers we ordered the devilled eggs (bland and basic) and crab cakes (overcooked). Finally, for entrees we ordered the pecan crusted trout and chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles was terrible. The chicken was small and dried out and the flavor didn't even compensate. The best thing we had here was the pecan crusted trout. It was well-cooked and the peach chutney on top was a nice compliment.  Overall, I won't be returning if I find myself back in Charlotte.",

My son had the filet with sweet corn which he thoroughly enjoyed. I ordered salmon with roasted cauliflower. The salmon had a delicious sauce the complimented the salmon.

I was beyond impressed with this incredible brunch. First, the spread was huge...Anson Mills Grits with a lump shrimp and sausage topping to  a juicy herb encrusted pork loin to a delicate homemade banana cupcake with walnuts, pineapple cream and  the most fabulous frosting I've ever tasted (so light and airy).    Second, the food is fresh and hot...it's serve piping on skillets and it is rotated often. The green beans were crisp my friends, the do not cook food to oblivion (hallelujah buffet gods!)  If buffets are not your style (which trust me this one should be), they do offer a  made-to-order breakfast tapas menu that is included in the $20 price (it also includes drinks).   Third, service is super friendly...our server was so on the ball she gave us the same level of attention as if we were at a seated meal. Never was a drink left half-empty or a stack of plates visible...and I did eat stacks haha. Also, be sure to park in Wells Fargo building 2 because they do validate at the restaurant (via token).   My personal favorites were the prime rib which was honestly so tender and flavorful I could cut it with a butter knife. I also drank the heck out of their Mimosa tea which is essentially an Arnold Palmer with a slight hint of orange (and it is very refreshing). I ate way too much and honestly wasn't hungry till 8pm that night, come hungry and you will not be disappointed!   I will be returning soon!",

    "text": "I've been to this restaurant for several other business dinners but this visit was the most unsatisfactory visit.  Fresh off a 5 hour flight, we checked into our hotels and went straight to dinner at 8pm. We were famished after our flight.  The meal started out great. We ordered the LOCAL ANTIPASTO PLATTER with assorted dry cured 100% berkshire meats, olives sweet and salty pickles, and toasted bread. It was delicious!  We took our time to enjoy the appetizer while chatting. When we finished our appetizers 20 minutes later, we looked around for our waiter expecting our dinners. He immediately came over and apologized that our 2 dinner entree order went in after a large table's order and he was working on getting our orders rushed through.   Unfortunately, our table didn't receive any bread so we had to ask for it to tie us over. He looked perplexed why we didn't get bread but made sure a basket was brought over immediately. Don't know if it was because we were starved but the house bread was yummy with peach butter spread.  It was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners. He exclaimed that it was an ordeal trying to get our entrees. REALLY?!? Sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected. Hell's kitchen wouldn't stand for it.   - PECAN CRUSTED SNAKE RIVER TROUT: hearty portions/ over blackened - PAN ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS: right portion size but toooo salty - LOCAL SQUASH & ZUCCHINI WITH SWEET VIDALIA ONIONS: over cooked and mushy.  Our waiter, Adam, was very nice and checked in on our table several times throughout dinner. He apologized several times and we understood it was out of his hands. The restaurant GM should have made an appearance to our table. Lucky we didn't have clients with us this evening. Poor kitchen line management explains another reason why business dinners take 3 hours at these types of restaurants.",

The atmosphere is nice and the service is good but, unless you're a Smuf, you'll spend a lot of money to leave hungry.  In the future, this place will surely be a \"drinks only\" place and we'll have dinner somewhere else.",

If you like to endlessly stuff your face, then that might be a great value but I prefer quality over quantity. Maybe I was expecting more because all of the hype and rave reviews. For $24 I would have easily gotten a better meal at a sit-down, made to order restaurant. They had a decent selection though,  for example: fresh fruit, salad, breads/muffins, scrambled eggs, mac and cheese, potatoes, bacon, sausage, grits, cocktail shrimp, salmon....etc. Nothing stood out in terms of taste except the mac and cheese was pretty good. Service was ok too.",

The dishes were well presented and the taste lived up to expectations.  The stand-out was the pecan-crusted trout but one can't go wrong with any of the dishes.  Why 4 starts and not 5?  Our waitress was the reason for that.  We only had two drinks per person and each round took forever to arrive. She really should have tried harder.  Highly recommend Mimosa's food.",

    "text": "If I could give Mimosa Grill \"0\" stars, I would.  I made a reservation with Mimosa for my family's Thanksgiving meal in 2012.  I called a month in advance and inquired about the menu.  I was explained all the menu choices that would be available and with Mimosa Grill's reputation, decided to go forward with it.  When we arrived on Thanksgiving Day, the restaurant did not have a menu - it was a buffet.  Never was this mentioned during our 15 minute phone call when I made the reservation.  A lot of people do not like buffets - so this should be made clear!  Secondly, the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet.  This caused the restaurant to REEK of salmon and therefore every bite of food I took tasted like salmon (which I don't particularly like).  The rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy.  But, hey, at least I didn't gain weight over the holiday.    I believe when a restaurant serves a holiday meal, there is a special trust they must have with their customers.  We choose to trust the restaurant with our most treasured memories. Also, holidays are so booked, we can't leave and go to another restaurant!  Mimosa Grill blew it (although I am pretty sure we will look back at this and laugh).  We did call Zink's (where we ate last year and owned by the same company) to see if they could fit us in.  Unfortunately, Zink's had also chosen to go with a buffet this year (unlike last year)  and didn't have any tables available.  What a shame - I will definitely be more discriminating next holiday, and my sister is even entertaining the idea of cooking.",

We followed others to the line and quickly noticed that there were labels for items but no items. what I couldn't believe was the fact of cold food in the pans. I sat down with my food and noticed how cold it was, the waitress removed it never asking if everything was alright. I made another plate without items which could not be microwaved. I asked the man at the carving station and he got someone to heat my food.  I was also surprised at the lack of breads, pastries, waffles, pancakes and egg choices. The thing is that all of these comments, problems, and people walking away hungry could have been solved in house if they had managers checking on their guests,",

It was just ok. Fairly bland, not much more than that. As for price? Maybe a bit overkill. Got nothing fancy and left at probably $120.

    "text": "Disclaimer: This review is for their thanksgiving brunch only.   This is our family's second time doing thanksgiving with the folks at mimosa's grill. Last year, I would give it a solid 4 stars (but this year it's more like a 3.5). Here's why:  The food was pretty standard for a thanksgiving buffet. They had all the fixings that you would find (stuffing, green bean casserole, squash casserole, sweet potato, and turkey). There was only 2 carving stations (ham and prime rib). The prime rib was INSANELY salty, tasted as if the beef was cured (or the chef forgot how much salt he put in it). The highlight of the buffet would be the giant turkey legs, side dishes, and the raw bar. I love raw food and there was an array of cocktail shrimps, oysters, and smoked salmon where I was able to munch to my delight.   Here's the TLDR: Pros: Casseroles: it's pretty hard to mess up casseroles but I have to say it was pretty delicious Raw bar/cheese and meat station: the appetizer courses were honestly my favorite.   Cons: Carving station: only 2 and the meats were not that great Dessert: the dessert was all pre-bought and you could blatantly tell. For a thanksgiving brunch, I would want it to be homemade.  For $40 bucks a person before tax, I do not think this was worth it. But the reason I give this a 4 star instead of a 3 was because of the service. I'm going to be honest with you and my family is filled with looney bins and we ask for some silly requests (warming up cookies and a glass of milk). The server answered all of our requests without hesitating and that basically made our meal. Would we come back again for thanksgiving? Maybe. But we'll keep our options open for next year.",

We've seen the restuarant in passing and I work in the area so I see it while taking walks and never thought to go inside. WHAT HAVE WE BEEN WAITING FOR?? Is all I can say...  Our first course included: Hummus with veggies & olives plus grill pita bread & Season Salad with FRESH tomatoes, carrots, etc.. Both were AMAZING, the Hummus was so tasty and the pita bread had a very nice char taste to it. The dressing on the salad was so GOOD that it made me want to rub my finger through the bowl and lick them :-)  Our Main Course included: Pecan Crusted Trout over mashed potatoes & haricot verts & Herb crusted Salmon over fresh sauteed sweet corn with cilantro and veggies. There are no words to express how FRESH both entrees were and how many flavors were involved with each. They were both very pleasing to us.  Our final Course Dessert: Cheesecake & Peach Cobblese with BrownSugar Icecream We are not big dessert eaters however my husband demolished the cheesecake which was pretty tasty, the peach cobbler crust was good (seeing that we both are not into cooked fruit, we just ate on the crust with the ice cream which was a SCORE)..  I enjoyed my dinner so much that I walked over for lunch the next day and had a Hummus Wrap which was AMAZING. I really like this place, the only reason they didn't get a 5 STAR out of me is because I have to ensure they are consistent. Once visit doesn't amount to 5 stars, nor does two visits. I need to see them under pressure (service, cooks, etc..) so I will wait until I visit with a large group and see how fast, professional, and good the food is and if they pass I will update my review accordingly.",

I can't help writing a review this time. I sat at a booth table in the bar area because I was interested in their \"Bar Bites\" menu. I started with Ridge Wine Three Valleys Zinfandel. So  nice! Then I had Chopped Salad. Really good! When I was about to finish my first glass of California Ridge Zin, I ordered the Angus Burger without knowing that they grind meat in house and the meat consists of chuck, brisket and short rib.  OMG, how wonderful!  My Angus burger came with coleslaw and fries. Coleslaw was so good without being too sweet or salty or saucy. Fries were so crispy and light.  And the burger, the buns were nice and soft, the beef patty was cooked accurately medium as I requested and juicy and flavorful. Because it's Chuck, brisket and short rib! That's why! What a combination! This was the best burger I've ever had in a very long time.",

Plenty of space for large groups. We only had 4 people and sit by the window.   Our food was delicious. We went with all the Yelp favorites - grilled kale salad.  Yummy. Not heavily dressed - trout - 5 stars.  I don't usually eat trout but this was tender flavorful and very memorable - duck - very tender. I had it medium and it was just the right temperature for me.    I would recommend for locals and travelers alike.",

But tonight, my waitress convinced be to try the very popular pecan-crusted trout. It was wonderful! And the mashed potatoes served with it were silky smooth and delish!  For dessert, I had to try the Banana Puddin' Creme Brulee. No regrets there.  But the highlight of the meal for me was the appetizer. Mimosa Grill's version of hush puppies has the hush puppies hollowed out and filled with a lightly sauteed shrimp in a white wine cream sauce and served on a bed of a red pepper and tomato sauce. Just better than you can imagine. Don't miss trying this appetizer.  The waitstaff was so nice and helpful and the decor and atmosphere was so pleasant.",

I sat in the bar, ordered a trio of appetizers and watched the Celtics/Magic playoff game on TV.  Pros -Attentive Service - the bartender was Johnny on the Spot and got my martini to me coldly and quickly, kept my water full and got my food out fast and hot. Nothing wrong with that. -Food - I ordered the beet salad, carolina lump crab cake and hushpuppy crusted oyster grits off the Grits Bay menu. While the beet salad wasn't great, the other two knocked it out of the park along side the awesome assortment of fresh-baked bread things (no idea what they were actually, smallish muffin). A dash of hot sauce and I was having the Southern Food experience I hadn't yet had in Charlotte. -Lowkey Atmosphere - I'll reiterate that as a solo business traveler, environment is key so you don't feel like a total creeper eating out alone. The bar at Mimosa was the perfect environment to blend-in, eat some great food and not feel like a pariah. I'll be back.  Cons -One bone to pick with the beet salad, not enough beets and too much goat cheese - more of a goat cheese dip with beets.",

I couldn't stop texting all my friends about how great my dinner was while I was eating it; It was mouth watering. I would have given this restaurant 5 stars until I had the dessert...it was a complete letdown.  I ordered the creme brulee, it was ice cold except for the Luke warm caramelized banana on top. I think it would have been great if it was even  luke warm, but it obviously just came out of the fridge.   It was even served on a napkin as if it would be too hot for the plate..definitely not the case. I am not sure if this was a 1 time thing or this is how normally served, but in my opinion, have the excellent dinner and either order a different dessert or get one elsewhere.

Started off in the bar which was ver nice. Tuesday was $5 watermelon drink day. They also offered us 2 plates of mussels that were extra from the kitchen somehow. And at no charge!  Attentive servers and liked the menu choices.  A little more expensive than other places but worth it for the great food and atmosphere.",

I live in New York and haven't been back to Charlotte in a while, but any time I hear someone is visiting, I always suggest Mimosa and the wagyu flank steak.  They also have a complete wine list and the bar is fun and modern.  I was there for a business dinner a while back and 2 different couples got engaged there on the same night so it's safe to say that it is very romantic as well.  Very highly recommended restaurant.  I can't wait for a reason to go back to Charlotte so I can visit.",

We were seated promptly and offered beverages within minutes of being seated. I got a basil strawberry martini which was refreshing. My husband ordered a mojito. I ordered the pecan encrusted nc halibut. It was crispy and delicious. It was served over a potato puree with green beans. It was a good portion. I was full but still had room for dessert. We ordered the apricot dessert and sadly this was my least favorite item on the evening. It tasted old and between my husband and I we didn't even finish half of it. We ended the meal with a couple of expresso and got the bill which was 125$ Everything was worth every penny except the disappointing dessert. But whenever we are in town again we will probably try this place out for brunch, lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "My coworker and I were working a show at the Charlotte Convention Center around the corner. We had to get out of that hell hole and see the sun, so we took a little stroll over to Mimosa.   Using spicy ranch instead of regular ranch at Buffalo Wild Wings is my co-worker's idea of adventurous eating. However, being a good food ambassador, I always encourage, nay insist, that when travelling and working with those of the \"meat and potato\" crowd we exit their comfort zone. So far, I have been shown nothing but appreciation in this regard and have even converted some folks from the boring, mundane blahs of chain food dining.   I forced my slightly older pal to go here instead of Bojangles in the Convention Center. I am glad we did. I looked over the menu and there were plenty of good options. As a southern boy at heart, I had to go with the shrimp and grits.   I am demoting one star for this dish. Yes, it was technically grits with shrimp, but so far from traditional or anything recognizable as the dish, that calling it S and G is improper. This was more like a gumbo than grits. The grits were well cooked and creamy. The shrimp was most definitely the bite sized frozen shrimp available at WalMart, so points off for using that crap. There were peppers and onions and some sort of red \"gravy\" on top that can only be classified as a tomato-based sauce reminiscent of that served on gumbo.   Everything tasted nice but the huge deviation away from traditional shrimp and grits had be bummed. I'm not hating on the flavors, but serving this as shrimp and grits in the South will only get you ridiculed.",

We decided on Mimosa Grill based on their amazing Yelp review and delicious pictures!  I ordered the catch of the day, which was Swordfish swimming in a pond of the most amazing sauce I've ever tasted! The fish was accompanied with shrimp, beans, corn, tomatoes and lots of delectable vegetables. This was my first time at Mimosa so I didn't have any expectations. Needless to say, Mimosa completely blew it out of the water. My friend ended up getting the NY Strip which came with potatoes, also delicious (but I liked mine more :P) I can't wait to come back to try the Wagyu and crab cakes!",

There was definitely more southern seafood options which I don't eat but other than that things were fresh and the menu listed local farms on the menu which I like.  I got the burger and it was delicious and the bacon aioli was heavy (in a good way) and tasty. The bun didn't seem quite brioche to me but still very good. The burger was cooked perfectly (medium). I asked for seasoned fries but got the sweet potato, the bartender got me the right fries though, she was great about it. I of course tried the sweet potato fries, I didn't care for them, a little too soggy for me. But the seasoned fries were great, similar to old bay seasoning. Service was pretty good.  This place definitely is a fav, it filled fast for the lunch crowd, including the bar. If I were back in Charlotte I'd give it a try for dinner for sure.",

The salmon was crispy on top but mushy beyond belief on the inside. The lamb was not only horrible but $35. The fried chicken came out black, not dark but completely burnt.  When I said to the waitress the chicken was burnt she replied that it has a sugar crust and that was how it was supposed to look.  Right after she left the neighboring table said they have had the chicken many times and that it was in fact burnt.  For over $50 per person for a meal I would expect better.  Maybe it was an off night but with dozens of better places in Uptown I won't be back any time soon.  AWFUL",

    "text": "WORST EXPERIENCE AT MIMOSA GRILL...EVER...TONIGHT!  Good heavens...what in the world has happened to quality service?! The food was good. Not great on all counts, but solid in the good category.   Our server? What a total ninny!  He asked for drink orders & disappears. ELEVEN minutes AFTER I started looking for him other waitstaff notice that we're looking around & ask if they can help & he suddenly materializes, asks us...AGAIN mind you...if we'd like a drink.   \"Why don't we start by bringing the ones we ordered earlier before we try to order another?\"  He looked a bit confused and then realized that yes...he DID get our drink orders. Ay yi yi!  We decide to order a few appetizers and a salad to share. Manager brings the prosciutto flatbread over, shares that the dough technique & recipe have been updated and we will love it.   He was not lying. It was fabulous though far more of a pizza (even the shape) than a flatbread. No points lost here, I wanted some cheesy goodness with a nice, dry prosciutto and a chewy crust. The fact that it was round and cut in 8 triangles is not an issue. Hushpuppies=yum!  Waiter returns & takes our entree orders. Standard scallop dinner was described on the menu and I asked the waiter to share the difference between the special and the regular dish...which I have had before. He fully confused the two and mixed up the size, the volume, the accompanying sauces/items and basically was twirling in a circle. He stated that the kale was mascerated. I asked if it were in a sauce and he looked at me like I was as dumb as a box of rocks and then S L O W L Y repeated and overly articulated Maaaa-sur-AY-tid. He continued on... \"That is a special way of making the kale\"  I could not help myself.  \"Do you perhaps mean massaged? With a combination of acid, oil and salt?\"  Waiter stepped in closer to the booth. Maaaa-sur-AY-tid.  I GIVE UP!  This, of course, is the same waiter who when I asked to hear about the specials & told him I had a severe finned fish allergy and could only have shellfish went on to tell me about the SC Tilefish and how marvelous it was & the spectacular Trout. And when he DID tell me about the Prince Edward Island mussels and described what they were cooked in...a rich tomato, garlic and fennel sauce and I asked if the PEI were done in a cioppino style he replied...I kid you not...\"Pea E Aye, what? And what's cioppino? I have never heard of that.\"  PEI...Prince Edward Island...& then I went onto describe cioppino. OY VEY!  So my son...who I had been so excited to see after a nearly 5 hour drive in order to do so...ordered the scallop & oyster special and I selected the pimento cheese ENCRUSTED filet of beef. Served w/ vegetables & iron skillet potatoes. Okay.   FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES after placing our entree order...it arrives. I know this because I was taking YELP photos after he walked away and have a time stamp.   Plate in front of son looks somewhat close to what he ordered. Mine looks NOTHING like what was described except that it is beef. The 'encrusted' pimento cheese was lukewarm, at best, RUNNY to the degree that I initially thought my beef was covered w/ creamed corn and the vegetables were TIRED and lukewarm. The skillet of potatoes were less full than I have ever experienced in the past. Here is a tip...say 'encrusted' and CRUST should be a part of it. Salamander grill it!  So I eat a few bites of my filet and it's okay, but the temp is far too cool to be fresh...more along the lines of it were sitting for a LONG LONG time. When my son has enjoyed his fill (and kudos, the bay scallops were large and tender) and we ask for boxes we are rebuffed. Instead, worlds worst waiter is going to box it up for us. When I was served I had cut my filet in half, knowing one half would come home as I am not eating half a pound of meat at dinner. The other 4 ounces I had cut up and eaten less than 2 ounces of. The small box came back and I had to move it so I could open my wallet. Box felt very light. Looked in...no potatoes. No vegetables. None of the cut up meat and none of the 'encrusted' pimento cheese that had slid off the filet half. Just one sad, room temperature piece of meat alone in the corner of the box.   I indicated that I intended to take ALL my food home and he was a) very surprised I wanted my plate b) said he hoped he could still get my plate and c) my son had predicted that my plate was going in the trash when said waiter took it the first time. He was darn near right.   128$ later including tax, I still left a 23.00 tip. I have GOT to stop tipping for craptastic service. For whatever reason, I cannot bring myself to do so.   For many, many years I have eaten at, and very much enjoyed meals at Mimosa. This was so epically bad on so many levels that I frankly cannot imagine what on earth would possess me to waste 2 + hours, 150$  and end up with ridiculously poor service that would not fly at the Golden Corral. How is this happening at Mimosa Grill?   GAH!",

After taking a mini vaca to Charlotte, let's say we were two very hungry people after that 8 hr drive...and Mimosa happened to be around the corner from our hotel. Never having southern food before, I was somewhat skeptical, however, Mimosa changed me for the better.  We literally got a sample of most of the items on the menu. The 'sweet' tea drink = FANTASTIC...it's some arnold palmer mix with a little southern lovin ;) then their cocktail - superrr strong but still awesome....    As for the food, the pulled pork was just great and so was the salmon...plus all the side dishes we got with it. gumbo, mashed potatoes, two tacos...absolutely the best food I've had in a long time!!!  plus the bartender was so cool, Rob was the nicest person ever.",

The cosmopolitans were tasty (yes, I still drink them!) and mixed well.  I spilled my drink about halfway through & the bartender came around to help me mop it up & graciously remade me my half drink!  The appetizer.  The Popcorn Shrimp.  Not good.    Maybe it's just me, but I think of popcorn shrimp as little nuggets of shrimp wonderfulness, just crispy enough, but not over done.  No sauce on the shrimp to weaken the glorious bond of shrimp & crisp, light batter.  We didn't get those.  My sweetie said \"I've never heard you say you don't like something at all\",  but I did just that.  The poor shrimp were smothered in some kind of sweet-ish red sauce and then covered again in some kind of sweet horseradish sauce.  There was no crisp left in the coating and the texture in the mouth was swampy & eel-like as the coating slithered off the shrimp.  I don't usually have texture issues either, but ugh, blech, blaaah!  Sorry, Mimosa.  You need a re-do on that app.",

Instead, guests were forced to stare at a large wad of rare beef for about 20 minutes under a heating lamp until a new piece came out. Mimosas were good at $3.00 per unlimited.

Drool. Perfect mixture of textures and flavors.   2) I was in NC for work and flying back to CA with only a few days before the foie gras ban so I wanted to get some in NC. Lemme tell you, not many places in NC serve foie gras. I saw they had it on their menu served on a burger so I asked the chef to make me a special foie gras appetizer. I could tell it wasn't grade A based on the texture but the dish he made was still delicious. Seared foie gras, grilled peaches, caramelized red onions, mixed greens, shaved Parmesan on a rich, buttery rosemary biscuit. The foie gras was a tiny bit grainy and didn't have the uber melt-in-your-mouth-jizz-your-pants creaminess and richness but again, it was still very good.  3) The bartenders were awesome and super friendly.  Side note: They have half off bottles of wine on Sundays! Bottles start around $32. Definitely a good deal.",

    "text": "We went to Mimosa Grill for the first time this past weekend.  It also happened to be Restaurant Week, but we weren't really planning on doing the Restaurant Week menu since we wanted to try their normal menu.  Also, many times the regular menu is cheaper than the Restaurant Week menu, which didn't happen to be the case at Mimosa Grill, so we went with the three-course meal for $30, not only for the price, but also for the delicious-sounding selections.    I started with some corn and lobster fritters which came in a small basket filled with 5 or 6 golf ball size fritters and thick, creamy Cajun remoulade.  It was a good-sized portion for an appetizer and tasted excellent with the slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Next came my rare tuna steak, cooked and seasoned to perfection, atop a bed of flavorful beans.  I then finished off my meal with a miniature pecan pie covered in ice cream with a side of peaches.    Our service was impeccable and our server treated us with the utmost respect (you never know during Restaurant Week).  We were seated underneath the large windows in the front of the restaurant which let in a lot of natural light.  We could look out to Uptown Charlotte.  It provided a great atmosphere.  Our visit was a great introduction to Mimosa, and we're glad that we picked it.",

I can't speak highly enough about the staff: from the event coordinator Abby, to the incredible service staff, to the night manager Greg.  Everyone made the evening flawless.  The food was delicious, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked.  We started with a cocktail hour with passed hors d'oeuvres, like beef wellington crostinis, mini crab cakes, and prosciutto wrapped pears, and a huge charcuterie display.  After cocktail hour, we sat down on the outdoor, covered patio for a 3 course plated meal.  I ordered the NY strip and was thoroughly pleased with the seasoning and temp, considering it was being prepared and offered to 40 guests.  The staff kept the wine flowing all night, never letting a glass go empty, which is awesome!  The servers even ran out into the rain to help bring our decorations in so that we wouldn't ruin our dresses.  I was overall completely blown away with the restaurant and will definitely be back for dinner multiple times.  Thank you Mimosa!  You made the wedding reception flawless.",

Last night we went there and had exceptional food, great service, and enjoyed the relaxing environment. I think my boss -- who picked up the tab and is notoriously stingy -- even liked the price! I had the Low Country Shrimp and Grits and we shared a side of the Sweet Potato Spaetzle. Both fantastic.  Tonight, after a day at the convention center, we considered our dining options. \"Hey, that Mimosa Grill was pretty darn good. Why don't we walk back to Tryon and take a stroll down the street? If nothing sounds better, we'll go back to Mimosa,\" I suggested.   And we did just that. Tryon Street has the usual suspects: Ruth's, Capital Grille, Hooters, Champions, etc. Nothing caught our interest, so back to Mimosa Grill we went.  This time, they topped the previous night's visit. I went with the 24-Hour Painted Short Ribs prefaced with the Pear Salad. Dang this was good. REALLY good! When I was served the ribs, I realized that my knife left the table with my salad plate. No matter -- these ribs needed no knife. A fork was just perfect for pulling the succulent and tender meat apart! And the risotto underneath the short ribs were cooked just right and added a nutty flavor and texture.  It's too bad that I am leaving tomorrow, or else I might break another of my dining rules: never eat the same meal at the same restaurant! ;)",

The house salad was forgettable though - way too much lettuce and almost nothing else.   The facility was beautiful, all field stone and dark wood and bright light. I'd eat there again, but it was not over-the-top wonderful.",

    "text": "Dinner last night with Granny and Waiting for a table for a GREAT steak was NOT an option. She wanted to go to Mimosa Grill as I had taken her there in the past and she loved it!  When we arrived, the restaurant was empty. The Hostess explained that they had just finished a buyout for 160 people and that we were the first seated after that. Our Server, Tom, was prompt in greeting us and setting menus. The nightly \"Sustainable Seafood\" feature sounded amazing, and was a brilliant idea. We were in the mood for Steak however, and so we both ordered the Filet, with Smoked corn and Anson mills grit cake, and asparagus. The order of Hush puppies (an institution) was ordered for the first course. We also wanted something from the chef and were sent a scallop duo.  The Scallop dish was a TRIUMPH! The first scallop, seared beautifully, was atop a Tempura fried Meyer Lemon Wheel, ditalini pasta, and blistered local tomatoes. The second scallop, seared perfectly as well, was collared with pork belly lardon, and set atop an English pea and mint puree and accompanied by a fresh Morel Mushroom. AMAZING. The Pea Puree was perfect. a great blend of texture, essence of the mint, and taste. I could have eaten it as a soup!  The Hush puppies came out and were delicious as always, although, a little salty, we still found them just as remembered, outstanding.  Filets arrived at the table and smelled of the wood burning grill. One of the main reasons I order a steak at Mimosa is because of the Grill. To my knowledge, no other restaurant in the city is currently using wood int he grills. I love this! The flavor is so multidimensional and savory.  The filets came with asparagus, which was soft and sweet. The grit cake, again, had a generous amount of salt, but still added the contrast between sweet, and salty. My Steak, Rare, was so good that it didn't last long, and Granny's (which she couldn't finish) ended up on my plate. Service the whole time was pleasant, courteous and unobtrusive, all qualities I think Tripp Cagle (GM) and staff do a really great job in training the staff.  Alexis Mejia, in my opinion is one of Charlotte's up-and-coming pastry chefs and has really taken the Mimosa dessert menu to new heights with items such as Peanut Butter Mousse Bombe with Concord grape granita (which we ordered) and the Key lime Cheesecake with Candied Orange Rind. All southern favorites, with some really fun accents!  I will say, I have always loved this place and get a feeling of nostalgia when I walk down the long hallway that is the dining room and feel the warmth from the sandstone columns. I know I'm going to eat well when I'm there, and they never disappoint.",

Appetizers that couldn't be beat: Lobster mac n cheese with Ritz cracker crumb crust!  Nummmy! Creamy, chunks of lobster - great comfort food on a cold night! Fried green tomatoes perfectly tender on the inside, crispy on the out...and a large portion of about 6 of them!   Now that I'm full before the entree, ordered the FAROE ISLAND SCOTTISH SALMON anyway, with a lobster and crawfish boil, rock shrimp, creamy grits, peasant bread & carolina bay aioli.

I'd been meaning to check out Mimosa for a long time and so that's where we went. Liked the decor - classy and understated; nice lighting and it wasn't noisy (that's an important thing for me - I hate having to hear the chatter and cacophony from neighboring tables in crowded restaurants!) The special for the evening was Seabass and I decided to go for it. They said I could replace anything I didn't like and so I went with asparagus instead of artichokes which is what they were offering. It was an INCREDIBLE dish! Amazing flavors and perfectly cooked fish. Even the portion was perfect (this is usually a grouse for me at these fancy restaurants - I feel like I haven't gotten my money's worth quite often). Just filling enough to leave some space for dessert. They have a nice selection of desserts too. I went for the Chocolate and Mint Torte. It was excellent! Great way to finish off the meal. My friend had the Salmon and a gingerbread-based dessert. He said his food was really tasty too. The service was good too. As is the case quite often, the waitress didn't make it easy to select an entree (which I guess is a good thing because she had wonderful things to say about all the options I was considering!). She was attentive throughout, especially with refilling my water, which I drank a ton of! Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I'll definitely be coming back sometime.",

The $7 cheesecake could fit on a tablespoon!  The service was pretty good in the beginning, but as the place filled up our server seemed to disappear.  He never returned to refill our glasses or bring the missing ice cream that was supposed to go with my dessert!  While the restaurant interior is lovely and the location is great for all those that work in uptown, the price you pay for the small amount of food makes it not worth it.",

I didn't eat the potatoes, but the beans and fish were excellent and it was such a hearty portion that I couldn't finish.  I also had a refreshing margarita. My coworkers ordered the chicken and the shrimp and grits - all 3 were very satisfied.  They also ordered wines and cocktails from the menu and were pleases.  Great server too!",

I wouldn't suggest all the plates on the menu but I would definitely suggest that you don't miss the lamb shank. It is huge!!! Reminds me of something Barney Rubble might eat. Very caveman like. So delicious and falls right off the bone. Minimal fat. The steaks are also very good. Do not recommend the chicken and dumplins. Salty and not at all like what you would expect.   Again a pretty good wine list and their bar area had lots of TVs so you could watch the game and have a beer or wine. Large restaurant. Good for groups. Had a pretty good cheese plate. Definitely recommend.",

I had the trout, and my parents both had the pork chop [with a side of mac/cheese] Before the meal we had an cornbread appetizer.   All of the dishes were well plated. My trout was good, but wasn't great. I was disappointed because the pork chop + mac/cheese was awesome. The pork chop was moist, thick, and just amazing. The mac and cheese was tasty but different.   For three, app and entries came out to $75. Not bad for a very fancy restaurant.",

    "text": "On a cold night that just happened to be my birthday, my friend and I strutted into Mimosa awaiting an experience. We had reservations and were promptly seated next to a window that looked out on a beautiful city view. The restaurant is warm, inviting and cozy... yet its a decently large area. I had really high hopes for this meal and there were hits and misses throughout. Either way I had a fabulous birthday.  Starting out with the service... WOW! Its been a while since I had that good of service, especially in North Carolina for that matter! Our server was a dashing fellow by the name of Adam and he definatly made our night. I think that his great attitude and subtle humor made my review jump up a star. Our water was always filled, food was coursed very well, and Adam showed great knowledge in the menu.  Now getting to the menu, which in itself was a bit of a cluster-F. I like more of a structure in a menu, perferably with no advertisements or noncense. I like Structured menus I guess. Maybe I am just nit-picky. At any rate we started off our meal with all recomandations from our server. The trio of Pear Salad was first. Three applications of pears were showcased, the only one that needed to be on there was the savory cheese cake with pears. The other two were nice but the cheese cake was rad. Then we enjoyed the blt Belly Sliders and the stuffed hushpuppies. I think the Belly Sliders were good... but I think they required salt, I felt that belly fat plus fried tomato could definatly benefit. The hushpuppies... no complaints.  Now the thing I was looking forward too was this pork chop with foraged mushroom mac and braised greens. We ordered our porkchop medium/rare and what we got was... well nicely seared but the inside was so bloody red it looked like seared ahi! We sent it back and by then there was no hope left... Alas! an overdone chop. If something is sent back I would be sure to watch it like a hawk! While the mac was good I really wanted a good porkchop.   The meal as a whole was good, save the chop. Im not sure that their \"farm to plate\" Ideal came across incredibly well, but I like the initiative. Definatly a delightful evening.",

The decor of the restaurant is inviting and upscale and the tables we walked by all had tasty looking stuff on them.  Our waitress was a chatty lady (I forget her name) who knew a lot about the Charlotte food scene as well as the menu.. and she went ahead and dropped some knowledge on us out-of-towners! Our waitress brought us a basket of biscuits for the table, all ofwhich were light and fluffy and oh so good! For starters, we ordered a couple of plates of meats and cheeses. The cheeses were good enough that our Swiss colleague even gave them his \"legit cheese\" stamp!  I ordered a pecan crusted trout as my entree and I thought it was VERY good! I was a bit too engrossed in my trout to follow what everyone else was eating, but I heard several sounds of contentment from all around me. I highly recommend the trout! You should try it!  For dessert, I had the pecan pie - it was good, but not fantastic. However, the dessert portions are just right.. doesn't leave you feeling like a bloated diabetic (no offense to bloated diabetics)  Overall, this is a really nice, upscale restaurant and it seems like it is one of the better restaurants in this area. I know I will be back here.. you should check it out too!",

Their appetizers (especially the tower) are delicious. It is a bit pricey and with it being uptown can be a little confusing to park. They do offer complimentary valet parking (tip them please!) and they do validate your parking. Lat time Dan and I went we didn't park in the right deck, however we went out for drinks and by the time we left parking was actually free.   They do serve lunch if you want to be a bit more conservative and just try it out. But I do recommend dinner, trust me the food is worth it. And I recommend the duck!",

It had thinly sliced apples, bacon, goat cheese, crispy black eyed peas and a lemon pepper vinaigrette - simply amazing.  Then I went for a side of sweet potatoes in back fat gravy (is that even what that's called?  I'm a Northerner by nature but wow, I walked back to the hotel practically skipping because of the complex deliciousness) and a side of cremini mushrooms and goat cheese (another standing ovation).

I ordered the salmon BLT with sweet potato fries, and as with all of their sandwiches it came with cole slaw. The salmon was cooked to my liking, had good flavor, and my only complaint is that it was slightly too small for the bun and I was left with a decent sized piece of aioli covered bread. The bun was awesome, however, and the salty bacon and aioli sauce complimented the salmon and vegetables very well. Both the lettuce and tomato were very fresh. The sweet potato fries were under-seasoned and not that great, but the cole slaw was some of the best I've ever had! I can see why they offer it with all sandwiches. The service was quality as well, and the manager even promptly fixed a \"messed up\" order when one of my fellow diners said her burger was incorrect for having sauce when she said cheddar and aioli only (but didn't realize aioli is the sauce). All in all decent quality food with pretty friendly service, and they were fairly quick during lunch time which was nice to get us in and out in a short enough duration.",

I loved that you could order off the tapas menu, which included omlets, quiche and french toast as well as have access to the large buffet. The biscuits and gravy were the best I've ever had!! They have an extensive bar with salad, mac an cheese, potatoes, salmon, roast beef, grits, green beans, eggs, bacon, and lots more that I can't think of. There is also a dessert bar available. This place is excellent. With the buffet, drink and tip it was around $40 per person. I will be back!!",

    "text": "Great spot in Uptown Charlotte.  Came here for a solo lunch while on a work trip, and sat out on the patio since it was a nice day.  The patio overlooks a nice little plaza area.  My server was nice and came to check in at just the right times.  She helped me decide which salad to get (I decided on the Pecan-crusted Chicken Salad).  For being called a lunch salad (as opposed to an appetizer or starter salad), it actually looked a little on the small side.  It ended up filling me up, but someone with a larger appetite might be disappointed.  I also ordered the Moonshine Sangria, as it intrigued me.  The flavors were good, and it was quite strong (they were also half off that day, which I found out after I ordered, score!)  Overall, it was a great little lunch, and for a decent price.  The service was also friendly without being pushy.  If you're looking for a bit of a kick, I highly recommend the sangria.",

Pimento cheese fritters were good but no competition for the stuffed Hushpuppies- I've dreamed about them. We had the Springer fried chicken and special filet, and finished it off with Milano cookie ice cream and key lime pie, both of which were not too sweet, which I appreciated.

The service is excellent and our food was delicious.  I ordered the shrimp and grits during lunch time and the dish was fantastic! I love traditional shrimp and grits so I really enjoyed the version I had here. The dish was topped with sweet onions & charred peppers andouille sausage, smoked tomatoes, and tasso gravy, all of which complimented the shrimp and grits nicely.

We had a reservation for a Sunday 11am that we accidentally slept through, but we showed up as soon as we could (1:30ish) and were seated almost right away. I normally don't like buffet brunches but this place got it oh-so-right. In addition to the buffet you could order tapas to the table. Be advised, these were not \"small\" plates, they were \"teeny tiny\"... like Barbie doll plates. The main event here is definitely the buffet. All the food was delicious from Mac and cheese to eggs, Ribs, potatoes, steak, sausage, bacon, baked sweets and more... I seriously would have went up for seconds and thirds if I hadn't already done so much damage to my waistline during the holidays.   Anyway, the point is... go here. Eat, and be merry. Grab a brunch cocktail because why not when delicious Mimosas and Bellinis are only $3each?! You're welcome in advance!",

    "text": "I had to call twice to book a reservation for my wedding anniversary for about 30 people. The first tome I called, the young man stated that he would take my information and get it back to the event coordinator. After a week of not hearing anything, I called back and spoke with the same young man. He had no recollection of the call nor was the event coordinator familiar with my reservation request. My information was taken for a second time with the promise that it would be given to the events coordinator. The following day, I was contacted and was able to successfully book the reservation.   Many days prior to reservation, I learned that many guests traveling from the Midwest wouldn't be able to make it due to winter weather. I called to change the headcount to 15-17 people, which she was more than happy to alter if I could bump my reservation time back an hour. I accepted these terms.   Upon arrival, I stated that our group size had turned to 11. We seated and all went well until the check was dropped. I was charged for 17 heads when only 11 were present. The manager stated that since I signed a contract, the best he could do was offer to remove 3 charges. I stated that my group was seated for a 11, but I was still forced to pay for the missing heads.   Now I could understand if it were a crowded establishment with a huge wait time, but there were more tables empty than seated. The manager also went on to state that since a contract for 17 was signed, then they had to make special accommodations to ensure all guests were sat; therefore, those accommodations warrant the charging of absentee guests.   This seems ludicrous to me. I have to pay for people that didn't come to your restaurant because of non-existent waiting customers?! There was no empathy, no care. Just pay us because you told us you were going to bring us more business. This was so rude.",

Another entree was the stuffed shirnp in what appeared to be a potato ball-- looked delicious and was devoured!  Feta and arugula pizza and a steak dish were also enjoyed at the table  Finally the desserts -- we received desserts with two.of the entrees - the pecan pie and the peach cobbler.. we all tried them and none of us were overly impressed and would PASS on dessert in the future  It or may not be worth a trip back depending on my circumstances for downtown Charlotte",

    "text": "We came here for restaurant week with friends to celebrate my birthday.  Unfortunately our visit started out poorly from the start when we had to wait 5-10 minutes for the Valet to return to get car so that we could join our party in the restaurant.  Once we arrived inside we were sat with our friends who had arrived before us.  The menu is very limited (only about 6 entree choices).  The Queen's feast menu was their typical menu with upcharges from the $35 3 course meal price on certain items.  I chose to order the baked camberlet, the filet mignon and the 10 minute cookies and cream dessert.  I'll start with the camberlet.... While this was delicious, the normal $14 price tag on it seems high for what was a small individual serving of baked cheese serve with two pieces of toasted bread with lots of butter on them.  Unfortunately my filet was rare when it came out (cool in the center) even though I had ordered it medium rare plus, it took a good 5-10 minutes before I was able to send it back, I had order my steak with the sauce on the side and it came back out covered in sauce, I chose to not make a big deal and tasted my steak..... It was chewy and had an odd flavor to it...I even had two other people try it and neither liked it. I let my waitress know it wasn't very good and a manner came out to apologize, he offered to get me something else, but I declined. He did bring me a complimentary glass of wine. Next came dessert, I was so excited for dessert and figured I'd be getting hot fresh cookies from the oven, this was not the case..... My dessert ($8 on the regular menu) consisted of two small cold chocolate chip cookies and a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. The manager informed me that he took my steak (regularly $28) off of our check but would have to charge me for my appetizer.  When our check arrived, I had been charged a la cart prices for my appetizer and dessert.... Essentially being comped $13 for the $28 steak that nobody liked.  This was a little disappointing.  My husband order the scallops, which he said we're mediocre at best, we found it odd that they were only seared on one side of each scallops and the butternut squash slaw placed on top of the dish was cold and mushy. If you are looking for a place to go uptown, I personally would choose elsewhere.",

Considering the time and location (the heart of Wells Fargo's Charlotte base), the restaurant was relatively empty and we were quickly seated.  To start, I ordered the garlic Parmesan fries. By no means the most delicious fries I've ever had, I nonetheless found them to satisfy my urge for something salty. They remained crispy through the meal, which you certainly can't say about many fries, and the garlic Parmesan seasoning was tasty enough to eat on its own.  I also ordered the ahi tuna as a main and it was, in a word, delicious. Not only was it well-seasoned, but it paired beautifully with the farro and cabbage.  The service was above-average, with the waitress quick to refill water glasses and more than willing to offer her honest opinions on various menu items.",

    "text": "So my first night in Charlotte for a convention and we came across this place. Initially they said they didn't have any reservations available until 630p so we decided to come early to have drinks and wait for our table. We get there at 530p and the place is practically empty. Huh? How is it you don't have any reservations and there place is empty. Anyway my small party is seated and we have a nice meal. I had the spice grilled Ahi Tuna which was delicious. Without doubt one of the best Tuna dishes I have had. The crawfish hush puppies are a must do. Could actually be a meal by itself. Overall service was great, atmosphere equally great, and meal was awesome. Dessert selection was mediocre but I won't hold it against them.",

It was hard to walk by the yummy shrimp and grits but overall MG has a decent #ketofriendly brunch menu to include standard items such as bacon, sausage, and eggs but I certainly appreciate the addition of seasonal veggies like zucchini and squash medley and expanded protein offerings like salmon, shrimp, and prime rib. I also think more restaurants should at least have one sugar free dessert option .",

I was able to get in and out at my own pace, and Derek's service was excellent. Would recommend this spot to anyone downtown who wants a good meal at a reasonable price.",

We started with the cheese plate and seafood hush puppies as an appetizer and both were very good. I had the friend chicken and pimento Mac n cheese. The chicken was dry and lacked flavor. The small Mac n cheese portion size was disrespectful lol but the two bites I had were good. My wife had the pecan encrusted trout and she said it was delicious (8 out of 10). When I mentioned the small portion size to our server he laughed and said \"yeah that is pretty small. I will let the manager know what you said about it.\" If you go stick to the seafood. I don't plan to go back.",

One bite in I knew immediately that the shrimp were treated with sodium tripolyphosphate  which is a solution used on shrimp to keep them \"fresh\" longer. Also leaves a nasty chemical taste and taints the whole dish. Since this was a business lunch I didn't want to make a fuse but I didn't eat my meal.  The server asked if I wanted it boxed up, I said no thanks. She never once asked if there was any issue. I had to ask for drink refill as well.

This was a great intro to the encore; I had the special which was blackened Maui Maui with grits and shrimp succotash.  The grits had grape tomatoes, sweet corn and arugula and was made with real stone grounded grits.  The Maui Maui was grilled perfectly with a crusted exterior and a white soft interior.   This meal was pleasant on the eyes and stomach and the portion size was just right. 2 of my coworkers got the hanger steak with sweet corn and potatoes, another got the fillet and a Cesar salad and lastly one of my colleagues indulged in seafood with grilled scallops over a bed of lettuce with some type of white sauce that she liked very much.   I was stuffed by then, but we tried the Key Lime Pie and the blackberry upside down cake both of which looked and tasted great.  This was my first time eating at Mimosa Grill in about 10 years and I will not be as patient between visits next time.   Phenomenal meal, enlightening conversation, in a beautiful atmosphere. Thanks MG!!",

    "text": "I went for brunch on a Saturday with a friend. Reservations aren't required, but I made some just in case. They have $25 mimosa carafes that are actually strong. Our waiter poured our first glasses and if he came by to check on us and we needed a refill, he would pour for us. Excellent customer service because we didn't expect or require him to do that.   We ate out on the patio, which provided us with a nice breeze and views of Uptown Charlotte. Even though there is a buffet, they also provided an unlimited tapas selection by request. The hostesses were super pleasant and our waiter was really nice. We even sat and talked for awhile after eating and he still checked on us.   The food is BOMB! The walnut crusted French toast has got to be the softest and most moist French toast I've ever eaten. The Mac n cheese had Parmesan sprinkled on the top. Personally, it could've been a little burnt, but that's just a preference. I don't even like grits, but I still tried the grits bar- twice LOL. The scrambled eggs didn't taste like powder- like typical buffet style scrambled eggs usually do. I want to take my dad when he's back in town.   This received 4 instead of 5 stars from me because of parking. Parking is NOT on Tryon; it's on MLK. After parking, there is a sign in the garage with an arrow to direct you where to go. It's misleading. It should be pointing to the left when it actually points to the right. I walked around the entire block before I even got to the front door. Also, they're supposed to validate your parking but the chaser ticket they gave me didn't work and i had to pay :(",

Decided to sit on the patio to enjoy the evening and ambiance. Patio dining is traditional wrought iron but the cushions on the seats help!   The cocktail menu has a fun selection but decided to have a Double IPA on tap called \"Baby Maker\" which I was glad to have a non-judgy female server to take that request. Taste was closer to a standard IPA in my opinion but that isn't the restaurant's call.  Ordered the Baked Lobster Mac and Cheese and it was ready before I was halfway through my beer! The meal comes out on the cast iron pan and they are quick to warn you not to touch. The Lobster Mac was very rich and well balanced. Could have done without the bread crumb topping but overall pretty delicious.  Service was good and attentive but not overbearing. Would recommend and will likely return on a future trip!",

From the potatoes to the Mac and cheese things seemed to be lacking in flavor and seasoning. They also offer a tapas menu where you can order from. I opted for the goat cheese and spinach Frittata which tasted like instant eggs and was not seasoned. My daughter picked the French toast which was compressed looking and sad. It tastes like cardboard and didn't even look good.   They offer a variety of options from biscuits and gravy, prime rib, green beans and a tapas menu with omelets and bennes. I wouldn't return here at all unfortunately. Maybe their dinner menu is better?",

    "text": "I was here 11 years ago with my daughter for dinner. I remembered how much I loved it, so I made a point of making a reservation for Saturday brunch with my husband while visiting this weekend. This was one of the best brunches I've had! Often, they are extremely overpriced because they offer such a huge array of foods. Honestly, how much can you really eat? I like their high quality yet plenty of great choices approach. They give you a selection of chef made dishes to have delivered fresh to your table in addition to the buffet. You can have all you like!  This eliminates the need for long lines at omelette and French toast/waffle stations, or rubbery pancakes which deteriorate after 10 min on a buffet. Great idea! Although tempted, I filled up nicely on the prime rib, shrimp and grits, smashed potatoes ( sooo good) Mac and cheese, green beans, kale salad, large chilled peel and eat shrimp. That was less than half the buffet. My husband loved the glazed salmon, tender and juicy.    For dessert, I had fresh fruit and their delicious peach cobbler. My husband asked for ice cream, maybe? Our server, Raghda, shuffled off, said they found some vanilla bean gelato and gave us a generous helping! Now, that is service! Btw, their Bloody Mary was outstanding. Wow. We both agreed that this is the best bargain we've seen in a long time. The food was perfectly prepared. The buffet was kept fresh and warm an top quality. Service from Raghda and the team was superb. We both agree it is one of the best weekend buffets we've ever enjoyed for the quality, quantity and price. Don't miss it!",

    "text": "So-- to begin this review, I will say, if you're considering this establishment, you can book a reservation online by clicking on their website through Yelp. It's super easy to maneuver! Although I'm not sure if it's needed-- my husband and I made a reservation 2 hours in advance and was seated immediately and there were about 3 other tables. Not packed at all, but the interior looked beautiful. Perfect for a business casual lunch or a nice evening date. Whether you're seated indoors or outdoors, the view is stunning-- in an urban city type of way. It's overlooking the courtyard and a pretty water display out front.   I suppose the only annoying thing was that once we were seated, it took about 15 minutes before we were greeted by our server and finally given a pitcher of water. Our server seemed very standoffish and left us waiting the majority of the time-- waiting to get water, get food, get dessert, and the check. I will say, It doesn't seem to be consistent, as the two other servers appeared to be very peppy and involved with their tables. Maybe our server was just tired after a long day?   Moving on. The menu seems to be revolving which can be great for those who are seeking variety. I was scrolling through the pictures and was hoping they had the braised short ribs; however thy didn't have it for my visit.   They have a plentiful variety of alcoholic beverages. Wine, spirits, beers, cocktails etc.   We had the cornmeal fried oyster for our appetizer. The texture is very crunchy and didn't have that overly seafood taste. The Fried okra is crunchy with the typical slimy texture . The Oyster to Okra ratio is 1:2 .  Fried Chicken, on top of Texas toast with Mac and pimento cheese. Per my husband, half of the chicken was cooked perfectly. The other other half was very fatty. The good half was tender and juicy. The crust was crunchy and not too oily. In regard to the Mac and cheese, for it being pimento cheese, it was really good. For those who are strictly traditional Mac and cheese or those who despise it, don't try it. (Albeit, there may be very few of you anyways)  I ordered my wagyu steak medium and at first appearance it looked medium well. Towards the center, it was more rare, so I didn't mind it at all. This dish also came with a lobster claw meat, fingerling potatoes and a corn/ bacon bit mix. It was delicious. The steak had a peppery crust but wasn't over flavored.   I had a coffee to conclude my dinner and my husband had the peach cobbler in a jar. He enjoyed it and said the flavors and textures complimented each other.   Do be cautious-- the cloth napkin does tend to leave lint on your lap. Easy to brush off but was annoying to look down after getting up .",

    "text": "When I first moved to Charlotte, this was the first restaurant I went to - the stakes were high. Mimosa did not disappoint. We came for lunch, so it wasn't too pricey. It's around $20 a person if you get an appetizer. The service is good overall but it did take a while to get our food and it wasn't that busy. Parking is difficult and expensive but that's common in uptown.   We started with the parmesan truffle fries, which were delicious, although just a tad greasy. I had just moved to a real southern state, so obviously I had to order the shrimp & grits. Fantastic dish, extremely flavorful, and not too heavy (for shrimp & grits). My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which he said was delicious, but complained that there was only one piece of bread/texas toast. \"A sandwich has TWO slices of bread. I got NO warning.\"... If you're a normal human being, I don't think you'll mind.   I really enjoyed eating here for lunch and I'll probably stop by again before I head back to Florida. I hear the brunch is good, so we'll have to see!",

The Shrimp & Grits station in particular is my favorite. They also know how to make a really good Mimosa. Great way to get a Sunday-day Drink started ;)  I highly recommend making a reservation beforehand. They tend to get busy but I've always had a really positive experience with the staff trying to accommodate as many people as they can.",

They had black linens as well as white linen napkins - always good for business lunches when you're wearing dark pants etc.  Several items looked great on the menu, so I decided to choose 2 entree's- Mountain trout, which I understand has been a staple on their menus since the first opened, and the Shrimp and Grits.  Both were amazing choices and I'd gladly do it again!  The wait staff was great and very friendly.  Made for a great experience!",

It's a little pricier than my typical lunch spots, but it also had a sophisticated and upscale feel.   They have beautiful, shaded outdoor seating which is the perfect place to sit on a nice spring day. Service is great, and the menu offers a good selection.  I went with a salad which I customized to add salmon and remove dairy, and my order came out perfectly. The salad was full of flavor, and I'd love to have it again and again.  My friends had sandwiches and truffle fries, and the sandwiches were big! They took 1/2 their meals home for dinner.  Expect to pay about $15-$20 per person for lunch, but also expect big flavor, great service, and a nice view of the pedestrians shuffling about uptown.   They do fill up for lunch early on nice days, so I suggest arriving a bit before noon!",

Facing the concrete terraces outside this masculine decor restaurant is an excellent bar and novel menu oriented toward adults.  I mention this as exhausted wife and I, after walking in the city center after a day at Discovery Place, arrived with our two grandchildren.  Yes, we had a cocktail as we gave the menu a once-over.  Cokes for the boys.  It was tough choosing as it was an adult menu, not children's menu.  There are great choices in appetizers, mains and desserts.  Seafood (4 of 8 appetizers and 4 of 9 entrees).  Four salads and one soup.  Entrees of steak, seafood, chicken, lamb, pork shop and duck.  All looked great and we had to negotiate with the wait staff for get something that the boys would eat.  Thank goodness for child-sized pizza ($7.95) and pimento mac n cheese ($12), along with an onion ring appetizer ($10) did it.  Wife had chicken ($25) and I had a nice burger ($7.95).  Two mimosas (natch!) were $12 each.  Total bill was $99.48 which rated a $20 tip for the great and accommodating service.  We were beat, but everyone was happy.  A very nice date place or for a couple of couples out for a nice evening.",

I asked for a recommendation on a cheese selection her choice of a local goat cheese was fabulous. For the entree I chose the New York Strip Pepper Steak and it was prepared perfectly. A glass of Beringer Reserve Cabernet went very well with the meal.

The shrimp and crawfish cajun hush puppy appetizers are a great twist on a southern staple.  They're big, but split in half and hollowed out to make way for the Cajun seafood mix.   The grilled romaine is delicious, but a little heavy, with bacon and quail egg.  We had the pecan crusted trout and the blackened mahi mahi, both of which were perfectly prepared, and beautifully presented.   And our waitress Swan was as delightful as she was prompt.   We probably don't try nearly enough different restaurants in uptown simply because we always know we will enjoy Mimosa so much.",

I am so happy to have found another great restaurant in Charlotte - we had relatives staying with us last week and didn't want to take them anywhere we hadn't been yet, in case it wasn't good, and we went to Mimosa after they left - were were so upset we didn't take them here!   The service was excellent - our waiter was totally on point and had a great personality, and we made excellent recommendations - I'll get to that in a minute. The atmosphere is beautiful - we ate outside, it was a gorgeous night. They have fountains right out front and large plants out on the terrace to create a nice relaxing feel. The restaurant has soft lighting and stone walls, and you could eat inside or out and it will be just as beautiful.   For an appetizer we got the mussels, which were in a garlic butter white wine broth - we were scouring the broth for escaped mussels by the end of it because it was so good we devoured it. Of course, even though I say I won't, I dunked the bread in the broth - delish. For the main course I had the horseradish-crusted salmon, which was very good. If you order this be aware that while the salmon is hot, it is served over cold vegetables - cucumbers and green beans. The dish wasn't as great as I thought it would be and I had immediate food-envy when my finacee's dish was placed in front of him - piping hot scallops, shrimp and lobster over grits and brown gravy - WOW! This was so yummy that I totally dipped into his dish after I finished mine. The manager even came over to see how we were because he noticed the switch - he was so nice, and stopped over a second time just to talk once our meal was finished. I can't wait to go back here!",

The trout (which I was told has been the only entree that's been on the menu for 18 years running) was incredible; light and perfectly flakey.  The homemade biscuits with seasonal fruit butter were light and melt-in-the-mouth good.  Unlike many establishments in the area that over-serve huge portions of food, this place understands the art of presentation and equally steps up to the quality you'd expect in the leading gourmet meccas.

Beyond the meal, my server was attentive, knowledgeable and courteous to my requests and expectations. My only qualm would be that the hostess was aloof and unconcerned. A common issue overlooked by even the most establishments. If I could offer any advice to the manager is that a hostess is the am ambassador to your production.

We went for Sunday brunch and were seated in the bar with the bartender as our server even though the place had many seats open. We started by ordering drinks off of their specialty cocktail menu. They had advertised a Jalapeno Margherita. After about 10 minutes and well after my dining companion had received their drink, the bartender came over and said that I needed to choose another drink because she could not find the vodka. We ordered shrimp and grits which were served with a film layer on top of the gravy as if it had been sitting an excessive amount of time in the kitchen and a minuscule portion of grits. The dish had fine flavor but was nothing special. My dish was the Mimosa Eggs Benedict special but unfortunately the eggs in the benedict were cooked hard so no delicious yolk to ooze onto the dish as intended. The bartender forgot we were there for awhile and our drinks were empty and then appeared to be caught up in eating some pizza and talking to other employees and we had to walk over just to pay and get out of there. I might give this place another try during a busy night but was very disappointed. This may be one of those places that is living off of a good start and good reviews but has suffered a major decline in both quality and service. Oh and by the way, if you are going to advertise a drink and don't have the ingredients then please offer the person a cocktail of their choice complimentary as an apology. That is what sets the 4 & 5 star places apart from the rest is a combination of good food, service, and management.",

According to my husband, the cobbler was \"OK.\" The trout was delicious and I would definitely order it again. Also, I tried the lobster macaroni, it was awesome and the portion was plenty.  The service we received was poor, as the server was inattentive, lacked understanding of the menu, and was not friendly. I would go back for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I have been dining at Mimosa for about five years now, since I work uptown, for lunch, happy hour and dinner.  I can say it is always a mixture of good food, average food, good service, bad service, mostly good service....I continue to return because it is most convenient for occasional work happy hours, work lunches and a few dinners... My last experience, drinks and apps at the bar, was yet again a mixture.  The first bartender we had was NOT attentive AT ALL, she did not bring waters, which we asked for, and is crucial for two women who have just left the office and are consuming wine...We ordered the shrimp appetizer and chips and dip.  Both were VERY good.  We ended up ordering a second shrimp. I had to flag down the bartender every time I needed something because she was too busy flirting with her partner, James, who later took over.  I HATE having to flag down a bartender because I feel rude but I needed my wine refilled!  The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is typical of a chain restaurant but still nice and clean.  I would not recommend an out of town business guest to go there, would not go for date night dinner or girlfriends dinner, but would go again for a quick glass of wine and app with a work girlfriend or if it was on work $.",

We were looking to have a delicious, upscale meal and that is exactly what we got. They had a great (and reasonably priced) wine selection. The chef sent out a really nice parsnip puree amuse-bouche for us, it was so tasty. I got the Pecan-crusted Trout as my entree and it was one of the top 5 entrees I have EVER had. It was absolutely delicious, what an incredible dish. I'm still thinking about it a month later. It has apparently been one of their restaurant staples - that doesn't surprise me. Our waiter told us that Emeril had been in the restaurant a week earlier and gave his compliments to the chef for the same dish. My husband got the Peppercorn crusted filet which was also fantastic. They did a wonderful job on it considering they're not a steakhouse.  Overall a WONDERFUL restaurant. My only complaint would have to be the background music - AWFUL. The restaurant is so elegant and lovely, and they were playing terrible pop music in the background. Hopefully they'll switch to Miles Davis by my next visit!",

We all struggled to find anything that tweaked our interest AND our pocketbooks. Wagu Flat Iron ordered Medium Rare came out Medium. I kinda expected something else on the plate other than some bread that the meat rested on. Ala Carte for $36? My wife had a $25 piece of fried chicken, again with the bread! Service was spotty (remember 20). I ordered coffee half way thru dinner and was never offered a refill. David needs a refresher course, refill iced tea, refill coffee and never constantly reach across guests to serve! The highlight of the meal was the hot biscuits but they were late in arriving, like almost at the end of our meal late. They would have made my Buffala a bit more enjoyable.",

They have daily specials and a catch-of-the-day as well as flatbreads, sandwiches to cover the level of hunger.  Desserts were a little small, but I guess that's a good thing so I don't come back to the desk with a food coma. Too late - food coma it is...",

When I walked in I did not know what to expect so I went to the bar to get a pre dinner drink and a peek at the menu. When I sat down Liz approached me with a warm greeting and asked me if I had dinner with mimosa before, I said no and she started to introduce the menu to me while giving great explanations of each dish. Because of her hospitality I decided to eat my dinner at the bar and that was a great decision! Liz recommended to me the New York strip special and it was superb! Liz also recommended falcons perch to go with the dish and she was not wrong. After the meal she started to recommend desert and if I had any more room I would of taken her up on it. In conclusion I WILL be back, The steak was amazing and the service still out shined it.",

MG rotates their menu seasonally, so even though I work nearby and stop by for lunch and dinner, they pride themselves on offering new, fresh selections all the time. Their bartender (an older, professional gentleman) is talented, cordial, but not always attentive.  Their salads are unique, filling, fresh, and seasonal. They have an extensive top shelf liquor and wine selection. If you're not interested in alcohol, try their sweet tea--it's a Southern Arnold Palmer (half lemonade, half sweet tea, all yummy)!",

The only food item that could have been improved upon was the boiled shrimp. And because I'm New Orleans, I think I expect more from everyone because New Orleans has the best seafood lol. Overall, I enjoyed brunch and a few belinis (y'all should consider a bottomless option).",

We both had cocktails, both were delicious. Started with the strawberry salad, light and perfect. The server then brought their house made biscuits with honey butter... WOW. I could've made a meal out of those. They melted in your mouth.  Then we had the meat and cheese platter. We had the spicy coppa with goat cheese and feta (I forget which of each). Probably my favorite part of the mean. They serve the platter with crackers, fresh fig jam and honey. Pairing that with the cheese and meat was to die for. I'd go back JUST for that.  We then split the stuffed chicken with their brussel sprouts. I'm a fan of brussel sprouts but these were like unlike any I've had, they were cooked to perfection with honey, walnuts, bacon, and other deliciousness. Get them, hands down.   The chicken was perfectly stuffed, not heavy handed just the right amount of everything. Super tender and juicy! The chicken just fell apart in my mouth, I'm smiling thinking of it.  All in all this place is amazing. I can't imagine anyone not finding something they love off of this menu.",

I had the sausage flat bread, which I would call an ordinary pizza, followed by the lobster mac and cheese. Back in the UK, macaroni cheese is a basic home cooked food for no special occasion, not restaurant food and I saw no reason to change that opinion after this meal. The lobster was nothing special either, lacking the slight sweetness and delicacy that it should have. Why would you mix those ingredients anyway? The coffee afterwards was truly the devil's work, I have never had a cappuccino taste that bad, burnt coffee with some kind of artificial foam on top. Definitely wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "Mimosa is another classy dining establishment in the heart of Charlotte. It's great for a business lunch, or a nice dinner. They also offer brunch, but as expected, it's pricey. The food is consistently good. Fresh flavors, interesting pairings, and they really have something for everyone. I very much like Mimosa, but don't frequent it as I (personally) prefer Ruth's followed by Capital Grille on the rare occasion we like to splurge. Though, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. It's great for a special dinner celebration. It's upscale and while not formal, somewhat dressy. However, business casual probably best describes it.",

    "text": "Saturday night early dinner. They have an outside patio that overlooks a court yard. Nice view! Don't worry it's covered and has ceiling fans for a steady breeze. We walked through the inside on our way to the patio. It was beautiful cool and dark. Romantic evening anyone? There were 3 of us dining.  To start we  ordered 3 appetizers. Tomato Salad Lobster Mac and Cheese Hush Puppies Stuffed with Seafood All three were very good. There was enough for the three of us to share.  Tomato salad was very fresh with raw peas and a yummy creamy sauce. There was a cored green tomato breaded and fried. Balsamic drizzle. realistically it could have been a bit larger. I mean how expensive are cherry tomatoes!  It was Yummy! Lobster Mac and cheese was delicious and creamy. It had big chunks of juicy lobster. The cheese sauce was divine. It was served in a cast iron serving dish. Hot! The pasta was orecchiette which can stick together. Maybe they should have tossed it in the sauce a few more time. It was still very good. The stuffed hush puppies had craw fish and shrimp in a tasty sauce.  Very good!  For entrees there was a Trigger Fish special which quickly disappeared.  Two of us had the fillet Mignon.  I ordered medium rare and my husband ordered medium. Of course they mixed up the plates. There was a size difference in the steaks. He ended up with a very thick big fillet and mine was thinner and smaller in diameter by at least half. Odd to say the least. My smaller piece had a chewy hard section.  My husbands was wonderful and he ate it all. The steaks come with 2 standard sides. A cast iron rectangular dish with cheesy creamy mashed potatoes which they brown on top which for the most delicious crust!  The second side is grilled peppers onions and squash. Yummy I tried the signature margarita. $13 my advice skip it.  There is free valet parking. Of course please tip your valet.  Our food server was a little odd.  Not much personality but maybe she was having a rough night it was a little warm to be running around outside. Humid!  Now it is a little bit of a walk from the valet parking. I overhead our food server giving wrong directions back to the valet parking. Maybe she was new. Who knows.  There are a few steps here and there so people with mobility issues please be aware.  Overall nice place. The food is fresh and most is locally grown.",

I ordered a chocolate martini which looked and tasted like a first time bartender made, not to mention, the glass wasn't close to being full. I had the lobster Mac and Cheese. I only found a few tiny pieces of lobster, one with some shell still on it. The Mac and Cheese wasn't anything special either. Our drinks and entrees took so long we asked for our checks as soon as the food came out, then had to physically track down a manager to take our pricey checks. Maybe they were understaffed or having an off night, but I won't be back.",

    "text": "Holy mackerel was this place amazing!! LBD status to the max.  My father, cousin, bro in law, grandfather, and uncle all decided to come down for a weekend for some bball, football, & brews brew. I researched some places to take them to dinner. I'm tired of the traditional places here in Uptown (Blue, Cap Grille, etc), so I decided to try something new. Working at BofA and living on 7th, I rarely have the opportunity to venture down Tryon. This has opened my eyes to a whole new world, just like Aladdin.  Not taking any chances, I made reservations for the 6 of us. For 7 pm, I really don't feel this would have been necessary, as the place was practically completely empty. Let me give you the run down of everything we ate. Please don't judge me. I know I'm a gavone :) ___________________________________________________ Appetizers  Lobster Mac & Cheese: Thought this was the worst of what we ate. Still, would order it again. Has a completely different texture of your traditional mac & cheese.   Cornbread: Comes out in a hot skillet with melted pecan butter on top. Do I need to say anything more about this?  Pei Mussels: WOW. The flavor of these mussels will stay with me for the rest of my life. The way they not only smelled, but tasted :)  Shrimp & Grits: A teacher of mine used to say: \"So good, it'll make you want to slap yo mama.\" Yeah, that applies here.  Pork Belly Sliders: This could have been my meal and I'd be completely happy. I NEED THESE AGAIN!  Stuffed Hushpuppies: Halved-hushpuppies, stuffed with crawfished and rock shrimp. This was the complete showstopper. It was spicy, but tasted so damn good.  Some Special Bean Soup: I honestly don't remember the name of it, but it made me all warm and tingly inside. It was in like a beef broth with veggies, beens, and chunks of ham. Splendid ____________________________________________________ Dinner (yeah, we had room for this too)  \"Old World\" Duck: This was the biggest piece of duck I have ever seen. It was cooked to complete perfection and had the perfect complimentary side of butternut squash.   Hickory Beef Tenderloin: A hunk of beef, thrown onto a plate with phenomenal ( and i mean PHENOMENAL) risotto. I devoured this thing faster than you can read this off the menu.  \"Duroc\" Pork Chop: Although I did not have the pleasure of enjoying this, my cuz pounded it (not pounded out). It's a traditional pork chop, but with fresh homemade apple sauce along the side of it. He did not finish at the table, but instead finished while sitting in his underwear on my couch at midnight.  So I decided to give this place 5 stars. But if you have read my reviews before, stars don't mean anything. It's all about the LBD scale, and let me tell you, this gets a 9.5 on the LBD scale. If I gave such raving reviews regarding the food, why a 9.5 you ask? BECAUSE I didn't get to try their desert. I'd be lying if I gave it a perfect 10 (like Scarlett Johannson) and it has a terrible desert. I will definitely be back there and will adjust the LBD scale accordingly.",

When the weather is nice, sit outside. The decor on the inside is stunning - good for a group or a date night on the Uptown.   Lunch specials are around $11-12. Without alcohol, dinner for three can easily dip into the $80-$100.",

We were sat without a reservation upon arrival at 12:10pm - no wait.   We commented how we had not been here in awhile and we were impressed with the service and expeditious arrival of our food. I ordered the daily special: chicken pot pie which came with a salad and my friend got the wonton grilled chicken salad. We shared our meals and they were both delicious. I would love to go back for a dinner, when I could spend a little more time enjoying the ambiance.

But then I saw the menu.  There were so many really interesting looking things on it that I wish I was with a bigger group so there could have been more ordering and sharing. I ended up starting with a goat cheese, beet and orange salad. With those ingredients, you can't really go wrong, and they didn't.   For dinner, I had scallops that were encrusted with bacon crumbs on top of a pumpkin bread crustini. Really amazing flavors between the bacon, scallops and the pumpkin. My colleague also really enjoyed his pecan encrusted trout.   Bottom line: boring corporate setting, the opposite of boring food.",

Definitely try the espresso cheddar! Everything else was great as well and we definitely planned to come back. Little did we know we'd go ahead and wander in again on Sunday for brunch.  The brunch buffet here is fantastic. Easily one of the best I've ever had. Not only was there an exceptionally tasty selection of buffet items (delicious potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy plus lunch selections like mac and cheese, green beans, beef, desserts, etc.) they also have a tapas menu of included made-to-order items. The walnut/strawberry french toast was out of this world. Several different omelets and more. Without a doubt this place earned a spot on our must-stop list of restaurants when in Charlotte.",

Our waiter, Andrew, and I hardly say his about a waiter, worked our table with perfection.  Being seen when needed, suggesting menu items that he liked over others, and was just plain honest, no smoke.  Many kudos to him. Three chefs and three food brokers dining.  We order their appetizer tower designed to our needs.  Kitchen executed w/o issues.  The crab cakes, mussels, hushpuppies and charcuterie platter were perfect. Entrees varied from scallops to Scottish salmon to the catch of the day.  We all shared.  All foods were prepared extremely well.  Only caveat was my spinach was sandy and gritty. We ordered an array of desserts; all presented nicely and we suggest the butterscotch parfait bread pudding. This was my third time visiting Mimosa's this year and I tell every one what a surprise I have had each time having lower expectations and a getting superb experience. Try it, ask for Andrew and enjoy the experience.",

Because it is located in the Wells Fargo atrium, it is advisable to make reservations for lunch during the week, because it can be quite busy! The interior is beautiful and relaxed chic. I had the hickory grilled steak and parmesan frites. I didn't care for the mimosa steak sauce that came with it, but I never use steak sauce, so take that for what it's worth (served on the side). The flank steak was served sliced and cooked as I had requested, and was topped with a gravy/sauce of some kind that was phenomenal. The frites were good too. My dining partner had the trout, which he had on a prior visit and was pleased as well. Our server was attentive but not intrusive, the manager came over to check up on us; the service was above par. For dessert I had the chocolate ganache cake and my lunch partner had the chocolate bread pudding.

The location and atmosphere is simply wonderful.  We sat inside at the bar on a Friday during happy hour and things started jumping.  Not jumping like packed and annoying, just enjoyable with people all over the place.  The bartender/staff was very attentive and very good at her job.  That is nice.  Just outside is a large patio area over looking a beautiful courtyard in the city.  Great location!    Truffle fries.... Now, the only other fries that I have ever had that didnt require and condiments were at Capital Grille.  They were $10 fries.  They are $4 here and simply delicious.  I will be going back many times to this place just for those fries (see picture).  Also stay tuned for update about the dinner menu.  Very soon.   Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

The first time here I got the chili because the items on the specials menu are only available that day. The chili was unique in some kind of crunch it had mixed in but just ok.   This time, I ordered the special of the day which was fish and chips. The fish was huge (plus in my book) but tasted like Captain D's (definite disappointment). It's near my job so I may try this place again to make a final decision on it.",

This review will be for all my lunch experiences which have generally been pretty good so, 4 Stars.  Honestly though, if I were reviewing the dinner experiences, it would be a solid 3 and I expect more from a place like this than A-OK.  On to lunch...  There is a good mix of appetizers, sandwiches, salads and entrees from which to choose.  There are also daily specials.  The only one I can ever remember is the Friday Fish and Chips because it's always the special I want and it's never Friday when I'm there!    I mostly land on the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.  The greens are always fresh and the shrimp are plump, firm and seasoned/grilled well.  Monday's Caesar dressing was just a wee bit flat but that was the first time ever so, forgiven.  Also opted for the Tomato Bisque yesterday.  It was quite good.  Nice balanced flavors, hot, creamy, delicious!  When I have strayed to a burger or something else more substantial, I always walk away satisfied as well although, it's not a cheap lunch by any stretch.  Not sure I will ever give them a chance to up the 3 Star dinner lens with which I view them.  Too many other, more consistent, options in the price range and vicinity.",

Even though the service can be inconsistent (I have experienced extremely bad service on occasion as have my colleagues), the food has always been excellent!  Last night my colleagues and I went to Mimosa as usual for dinner after work. As usual, we did not have a reservation. We were told we could not be seated without a reservation because \"we must honor our guests with reservations.\"  Of course, we would understand if there were a wait, but no seating?  Really?  What kind of restaurant doesn't set aside seating for walk-ins? Just stupid and rude, especially during Restaraunt Week. Done with Mimosa for good. Had an excellent meal and excellent service at Aria!",

I'm not sure if it was the hostess policy or just the hostess herself, but when I make a reservation for a business dinner for 9 people, I don't understand why you'd make us wait until everyone arrives to be seated. You can assume we'll spend a few hundred dollars and it seems that seating us sooner is in everyone's best interest.  Now to the dining experience...our waiter was great. The food was also delicious. The drinks were strong. The prices were reasonable (for a nicer restaurant). The ambiance was quiet and quaint. I'd go back, but probably not with a reservation so I wouldn't have to deal with the hostess issue again.",

Just as you think you can't take anymore, she'll show you things that you have never even thought were possible: made-to-order walnut encrusted french toast (seriously, best french toast ever), creole egg benedict, and whatever else comes to her deliciously profane mind. And you can't but eat anything that she puts before you.  Then, just as your eyes role to the back of your head from the sinful pleasure of overpowering deliciousness, she sucker-punches you with juicy chocolate covered strawberries, bread pudding, cobbler, and all kinds of cookies and brownies--if only to tease you of the sweetness that could have been.  Needless to say, this brunch will stuff you eight ways from Sunday and have you begging for more. Despite the trembling knees, out of breath gasps, and swears of never eating again, you'll be back.   Probably next Sunday.   And you'll again pay $20 for the pleasure (unlimited coffee, tea, orange juice included!).",

Everything was just really good and fresh.  I will definitely make it an effort to visit again when I head back to Charlotte. Probably try dinner. Wish I had made it to dinner for Restaurant Week but Beyonce was calling!!!!!!......  I don't know why the low rating but I know brunch and will say this place could come to DC and never been empty.

Mimosa, and it's sister Upstream, were two of the first restaurants in the city to recognize that plating is also a major component of the dining experience, and they didn't disappoint. My pecan encrusted trout was as much a feast for the eyes as it was delicious. Likewise the other two dishes at our table, diver scallops and short ribs were enjoyed with so many ooohs and ahhhhs I thought I was in a Vivid Pictures production. We also shared the squash casserole, greens, and roasted Brussels sprouts that were so good if you put them on top of your head, your tongue would slap you to death trying to get to them.  Service was outstanding, the decor and environment here is amazing, and the food is equal to those standards. Oh, sorry I don't have any pics this trip. We were having dinner with my GF's sister who I'd never met, and I must have heard 20 times...\"Don't embarrass me by taking pictures of your food (you idiot).\" So like the obedient submissive I am, I followed my instructions to the letter.

The interior is well done with a slick looking wine room/exhibition but that where it all ends. Chicken sandwich was bland but smothered in sauce. Side of bland coleslaw that looked like it was dribbled on the plate and hour before. Pulled pork was average if not dry. Chili is really bean soup.   Service was adequate but slow. While we ate a manager interviewed a prospective employee at the next booth. Seemed odd to me to do that where we could hear the whole interview.

    "text": "Folks, hands down this has to be one of the best brunch spreads in Charlotte!!!   I met some girlfriends here for brunch on Sunday afternoon. I scored a parking space on the street but they do offer valet and there are plenty of parking garages.   The inside of this place is gorgeous. There's plenty of beautiful tile work and it's all windows in the dining area so you'll have a great view. In the warmer months, there's even a lovely patio section!   For Sundays there is no regular menu! It's brunch or nothing! But that was totally fine with me! It's one price for all the brunch and tapas plates (mini omelets, french toast, eggs benedict) you can eat.    That brunch bar is loaded! It's got everything:  Mac and cheese (cheesy goodness)   A Grits Bar (Yep! There are tons of toppings like ham, cheese and bacon crumbles to add if naked grits aren't your thing)  Smashed brown potatoes (like hash browns but 10x better)   Peel and eat shrimp  Biscuits and gravy (mouthwatering good)   Herb Crusted Prime rib (tender and delish)   Salmon  Bacon and Sausage   Eggs  Shrimp and Grits The grits were nice and creamy! Just the way they should be. And the shrimp were tossed in a gravy sauce mixed with andouille sausage and spinach. With just the right amount of spice and flavor...I could eat this every day!  Chili (forget everything you know because it's freaking fantastic)   Whew!   I'm sure I'm missing a ton of things but it's more than enough variety for you to make sure you leave full and happy. What the heck are you waiting for?   Oh and if you somehow manage to have room left after sampling all those goodies....they have chocolate covered strawberries! Yum!",

Our server(Heather) was extremely courteous and took great care of us. The meal was fantastic and arrived quickly after ordering! Everything is made from scratch and any ingredients that you don't want or are allergic to can be removed easily. The restaurant offers a variety of beverage selections and also supports local farmers! I would definitely return for another great dinner!",

One of my friends used the term \"dead inside.\"  He also just kept pushing stuff we didn't want!  And it's not like we weren't ordering.  We ordered drinks, an appetizer and all three ordered dinner entrees.  And still he kept pushing like a used car salesman.  Speaking of cocktails - I ordered a $14 dollar old fashion that was served in a glass dixie cup.  I wouldn't even be upset but it wasn't good AND it was tiny.  Like a cocktail for babies.   Another classic quote from the evening.  My friend ordered the \"Tortured Pineapple\" signature cocktail because she LOVES pineapple.  When she asked about it he had abosolutely no idea what it even was.  \"I was tortured listening to him describe it.\" It also came in the baby glass, and didn't taste like pineapple at all.    All of that said, the food really was good.  And we didn't let Wet Toast ruin our time.  I'd go back!",

I asked to order certain items a la carte and for some other things and the waiter flatly declined each request.  Not rudely, albeit, but either he or restaurant policy was particularly inflexible.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  It was very, but I had to wait almost 40 minutes for it despite the fact that it was between peak times and there weren't many people there.  The food was great even if the portion was pretty small.  I actually left considering going somewhere else for the main course.  I provided 3 stars because the primary subject, the food, was great.  But most everything surrounding did not justify the pricing.",

Still an excellent place, but after reading the other Yelp reviews, I went in with 5 star knock your socks off expectations, and it's definitely not THAT good.    They make a solid cocktail in this joint.  Very good spot to catch a drink after work.    A lot of the dishes don't look like they do in the Yelp photos.  I think that's because every dish is made from scratch, hence slightly different every time, which is only a good thing.  They def keep it local and fresh here.  I recommend the pimento cheese appetizer, that was amazing.  The lobster Mac n cheese was fantastic, except they forgot to put the lobster in the Mac the first go around so I had to send it back.  Crab cake stack with fried green tomatoes was excellent as well.  Shrimp and oyster gumbo was fantastic.  Overall solid spot, but I'm not rushing to come back any time soon.",

There were SEVERAL people from the wedding party that ate at this restaurant that became very ill, had to go to the hospital and my daughter, who was hospitalized for almost a week and was incredibly ill!!!!!!!!!  This is unacceptable!!!! This restaurant shouldn't be in business as they do not know how to keep a proper kitchen, obviously and/or the chef and/or kitchen staff is not practicing safe, and hygienic methods in the kitchen !!!! This should never have happened !!  They should take responsibility and make sure this never happens to anyone else instead of sweeping it under the rug.  I guess if it was one of their family members or one of their own staff, maybe they would wake up!  This restaurant should have zero stars!  Our family is disgusted at what happened to our family member and the others of this wedding party on a day that should have been the most special day for them instead of seeing their family being sick and hospitalized!",

    "text": "This review is for Bar Bites only.  We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon near 5:00 after attending a nearby show at the Knight Theatre.  Hostess told us they weren't seating for dinner yet. (although according to Yelp they had been open since lunchtime) After asking to look at the dinner menu (it wasn't offered to us), we asked if we could just go to the bar.  Yes?  Yes.   They were far from busy at what was apparently a very off-time.  Another couple were at the bar already and obviously not happy with whatever was going on.  (I think they were trying to get somewhere and their app didn't come out fast enough...have no idea how long they waited, but they were clearly unhappy).  Fortunately we weren't in any hurry and started with a glass of chardonnay for me, and bourbon drink for Husband.  Bar Bites menu is so enticing we had a hard time narrowing it down:  Decided on: Nduja Sausage & Pimento Cheese Dip with house tortilla chips for $8.  And:  Fennel Sausage Flatbread charred peppers - caramelized onions - ricotta for $12.  Both of these were exceptional!  Full of flavor and perfectly executed!  As much as we loved our drinks and food here, I have to say that we felt like we were sort of/kind of in the way of them preparing for the REAL guests that were yet to arrive...We felt like we were trying hard for them to WANT us to be there.  (I know that sounds weird, but it was made even more obvious when we left and went to a much more welcoming place).    That being said, the food we did have was so good that had we felt more welcome we would have possibly had a great dinner to follow those bar bites! Which is also why this is still a 4-star review.",

As always, the cocktails were delicious, and service was excellent. Ordered two sea food towers for the table and it was beautiful and tasty. I ordered the trout as my entree and it was great, I always love fish prepared here. The salmon is absolutely amazing!

    "text": "We dined at Mimosa Grill for Mother's Day Brunch and it was quite disappointing. We have been to Mimosa Grill for special events before (Mother's Day and Easter) and we always enjoyed it, but this time was quite a departure from the norm.   They had a very hard time keeping hot food warm and there really wasn't a great selection of \"breakfast\" items. The two carved meats were VERY fatty (especially the beef), there was hardly any shrimp in the shrimp & grits, and the chicken was too spicy for most palates (which would have been fine if it were displayed as spicy). The breads were too hard to eat and they were completely dried out. The desserts weren't \"dressed\" properly so we ate something that resembled a Tiramisu, but it was lemon (who dusts cocoa on a lemon dessert?). The service was painfully slow and we had a pile of dirty dishes on the edge of our table at almost all times. For the price ($42.50/pp), they had many \"filler\" items such as salads, hummus, breads, dips, condiments and only a few hearty food items. Granted, we didn't leave hungry, but we would have preferred a few additional hearty selections. On a positive note, the potatoes were probably some of the best I have ever had.   Unfortunately, that was likely our last outing at Mimosa Grill.  For $200 (plus tip) for 4 people, I can't possibly justify returning.  We have ZERO issues with spending money on a meal, but we expect the quality to meet the price-point.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here.",

I love to go in the spring or fall when the weather is nice, so I can sit on the patio.   They offer a buffet and unlimited small plates for $20. You can also upgrade your meal to include mimosas. The buffet is delicious. I love the shrimp and grits and the Mac and Cheese. I also like the way they provide the bacon. It's in a large pan and they have pieces that are crispy and pieces that haven't been cooked as long, so you can pick the option that appeals to you.    In addition to the buffet, they also offer several small plates: omelets, French toast, etc. I like being able to go to the buffet and to select items that are prepared for me. The restaurant has a very appealing atmosphere. This is the first place that I take people for brunch. It's a great experience and a great value.",

    "text": "Took my parents here for brunch on a Sunday. First of all, decor is classy, but the carpet near the windows is torn up and stained. A place that gets this much traffic *absolutely* should have the extra dough to spend on replacing the carpet. So, that gets a low mark in my book.  As for the brunch itself, it was very Charlotte. That is to say, what you'd expect Charlotte to do well, it did great. It failed in other categories.   What was good: the grilled salmon was phenomenal. I think they used hickory. Just awesome. Eggs, green beans, mac and cheese were all above par. Another VERY UNUSUAL offering was smoked salmon with caviar garnishes (chopped eggs, red onion, capers). Is this a dish that is unique to Charlotte or the south? (I liked it, although I would have MUCH preferred to eat my caviar garnishes with caviar (including blini and sour cream).) For dessert, there were giant chocolate-dipped strawberries.   Also unique to this place is the all you can eat made-to-order tapas menu that comes with brunch. The walnut-crusted French toast with mixed berries was sublime. The classic eggs benedict was good, not great.  What was bad: they had an appetizer selection of cheese and fruit that was unimaginative, unappealing and un-quality (yes I made that word up to get the point across). Generic cubed hard cheeses and melon and strawberries that were under-ripe and looked like they hadn't been vetted for quality. The shrimp and grits was absolutely awful: a soup of gravy, some overcooked tomatoes and you had to fish around for the damn shrimp. The prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cobbler dessert had mushy apples, as if somebody had just tossed them into a pot and left them out in the sun for three days. The brownies and lemon tarts looked generic and store-bought.  The service was very good - our server took care of business and was perfectly charming.  So, this looks like a three star review. Why two? Well, the price was $21. For a dollar more, I could go to the Omni and have a proper brunch with an omelet bar, *real cheese,* fresh fruit, free fresh-squeezed orange juice, farm-raised bacon and sausage, and fresh bread pudding with vanilla creme anglaise. In fact, I think that's exactly what I'll do next time, thank you very much!",

The flatbread was amazing, hush puppies were good, crab cakes with the raddish salad were just as good, and the lobster mac and cheese was fantastic! Can't go wrong ordering any of those. Each appetizer is pretty small by itself, so keep that in mind if you've got a bigger group. Even though we couldn't finish the apps, we ordered dessert as well. The chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The cake was moist and not too rich and it was eaten quickly! Overall, great atmosphere. Went in for dinner on a Thursday evening and there was plenty of seating. Cocktail attire is what most people were wearing. Only reason I'm giving a 4 star and not 5 star is because I've had better hush puppies and crab cakes elsewhere (although they were still tasty here)!",

    "text": "Though it took me about five drive-bys to find the restaurant (it is exactly where my GPS said, just offset from the street - meaning I did not really look hard enough), the \"search\" was well worth it.  I was in town for business so I was dining by myself and wanted a good meal.  When I entered the restaurant, I liked the ambiance and appreciated the Southern hospitality.  The waiter was even nicer - good conversation but not too much plus great recommendations!.  For my cocktail, I had the Berry-Peach Mojito - yum.  The flavors perfectly mixed and the fresh mint added to the flavor.  Then, the meal - Pressed \"Springer Mountain\" chicken, braised greens, and Carolina Gold Grits-Risotto. all perfect.    First, I went against my usual to order the chicken (working for a chicken company - I eat enough of it on my own).   However this farm raised bird was perfectly prepared - crunchy skin on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside with the lemon-butter to perfectly compliment the flavor.   The braised greens were seasoned so well - a nice kick from the pepper vinegar and, of course, everything is better with bacon!  The Carolina Gold Grits-Risotto was also excellent, of course with soppresatta and goat cheese - how can you go wrong.  NOTE:  I really enjoyed this side - it is much more risotto than grits.  The only thing that was disappointing was that I was too full to try dessert.  I know if would have been fabulous!  Well, at least I know where I am going next time I am in Charlotte!",

The atmosphere is classy and urban, the service is phenomenal, and the food is outstanding.  Very creative twists on classic dishes, as well as some very original dishes.  This is an excellent place for a date night, or even an after work dinner.  I am a very big fan.",

I've liked everything I've ever had there from the pecan crusted chicken to the asian salad.  Can't speak to the drinks (probably wouldn't be a good idea to slam cocktails at a work lunch), but the food and service is always great.  It's not my favorite place in the universe, the southern-y type places are just not my thing, but I can't deny that the food is deeeelish.  Their catering service is also pretty great, and they're very flexible with choices.",

They seemed in a good mood and provided very nice recommendations for wine, appetizers, and meals.  The wine selection is incredible but, i was disappointed with the tap beer selection.  Normally, I would ding a place for that but, this is the South and, beer is not considered a food staple as it is back home in Wisconsin.  Also, this is a pretty fancy place and, they tend to focus on wine.  According to my colleagues that are very into wine, the selection was quite good.  I had the pork chop for myself, which was served beautifully but, a bit under cooked.  I ordered medium rare, it was rare.  They were very prompt and gracious about it - brought me a new one, perfectly cooked, and offered me a variety of other things to tide me over while I waited (it only took them 10 minutes to bring the new one).  It was cooked beautifully, very tender, well seasoned (balanced, you could tell it was quality pork), and it wasn't a \"chop\"....it was tenderloin meat on the bone...a very nice piece of pork.  i will definitely come back!",

When I buy A BOTTLE OF IT at Total Wine for $19-22?  Yes this bitch has felt the need to indulge after a hard day at work but seriously????  This is not a frequent splurge.  The service is impeccable and the lunch and dinner menus are top rate.  I will of course be back (unless my office gets moved too far away lol).  You are A-OK my pricey little Mimosa!",

Ordered pork belly and scallops for 30 bucks. Came out as two scallops and a piece of pork belly about the size of the scallop. Pork belly was overcooked and scallops were cool in the middle. I've had better quality and quantity for ten bucks less. My boyfriend ordered short ribs and that was awesome. For dessert we got the creme brulee (nothing special) and a pecan pie (crust dough was essentially raw). That said drinks were well priced and service was okay. For total price, I would not come back. There is better quality food and service at a better price elsewhere. We got 1 app, 2 entrees, two desserts, four drinks, and two coffees for 150 bucks before tip.",

A little on the pricey side, but not to terribly bad.  The only real down side was the service.  Now we might have caught them on a bad day, but the waitress seemed rushed and we had to flag her down if we needed something.  Other than that though, it was a good experience.",

I recall delightful scallop dishes, great sandwiches and great, locally sourced eats all around. Most recently, hubs and I enjoyed a tasty Easter brunch at Mimosa - a solid spot for all things eggy, French toasty and, well, Mimosa-y.   For $24 I indulged a large buffet full of goodness and the best part is the included small plates menu during brunch time. Not only is the buffet nicely stocked, but the small plate menu is impressive. You want the special benedict? Order it. It's included. How about a few slices of walnut crusted, banana French Toast? Got for it. And, the crowning glory to their Sunday brunch? $5 mimosas. Mmmm hmmm.   Get ye to Sunday brunch at Mimosa and be sure to visit the line a few times, including the dessert section!",

On Tuesday, July 15 after visiting Enso's in the Epicenter for a gathering, we decided to try Mimosa Grill for a late dinner.   We were seated immediately and sat near the windows overlooking the outdoor seating area and a courtyard. It started raining and the ambiance was perfect for an evening dinner.  My wife ordered crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and greens. I decided to try the lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms. WOW! I'm glad I did. Our meals arrived quickly and the lobster mac & cheese was served piping hot. However, the other items were lukewarm. We informed our waitress and she immediately took our items back to the kitchen. Several minutes later, the food arrived and everything was nice and hot. My wife stated the salmon was excellent and my lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms were to die for.  Though our waitress suggested many dessert options, we were stuffed and decided against dessert.  The excellent customer service, great food and the late evening ambiance was a perfect way to close an evening. I highly recommend the Mimosa Grill.",

Appetizer was reall good - epically the duck which literally melted in you mouth!  The stuffed hush puppies were OK, but didnt live up to th e hype the waitress gave them.   I had the scallops, which were done to perfection. The only slight nit I had about e dish was it was a bit over- designed, with a smoked pork wrapped around the scallops, and peaches on top.  I think the food could be a bit more streamlined, but it was really well done.    The wine. If list is fine, but a little short on choices. If you a really looking to have a great wine with your dinner, you might consider bringing your own and paying the corkage.   I overall, it was a good experience!",

However, this two stars comes from service. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and found it was missing avacado. The woman behind the counter looked put out when our (very nice) waitress asked if she could chop some. The avacado that was chopped for me was mostly black and rotten. My friend who owns her own resturant stopped the manager, Jared, to let him know and explained we didnt want a free meal just wanted to let him know. He looked annoyed that we stopped him and showed no level of customer experience. When he walked away from the table we all just looked at each other like, what just happened??? I figured if that is how management feels about the food they are serving then I can't  recommend this place. They took the salad off the check, but, again, that wasn't what I wanted.",
