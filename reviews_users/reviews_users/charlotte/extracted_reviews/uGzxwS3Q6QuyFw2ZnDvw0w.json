The first waitress was really nice but another waiter was in training and he took our order.  I ordered two hot dogs with a side of fries and my husband ordered a widow maker philly with a side of mac and cheese.   The food took over 30 minutes to come out. Im not sure if they were having an off day but 30 min for a hot dog and cheese steak is pretty ridiculous. All the tables around us looked pretty pissed waiting for their food.  The food itself tasted like food from a carnival. soggy bun with store bought sausage. My husbands sandwich was served with the fries I had ordered with my hot dogs and his mac and cheese never came out. The fries were sooo crispy it tasted like potato chips. Overall, very bad experience. Will not be coming back.",

I run the breakfast burrito, which is always made fresh to order, filled with soft, scrambled eggs, cheese, bacon and green peppers.  It's is very big and very filling (that's what she said, haha).  I have a buddy that always orders the eggs benedict, which he swears bye.    The service is superb, especially at the bar where I always sit.  JackBeagles becomes a much more appealing option when you consider how packed places like Zada Jane's gets on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  The early morning simplicity is what draws me to Jack Bs for breakfast and is why I will definitely be back one morning soon.",

Tip: if you want something so bad for you but is soooooo delicious get the shhh on a shingle... My personal fave.  I will be back and I don't have to convince the Mrs to come back for her fave pancakes . Let's keep this standard going... Awesome !

We ordered a dozen wings - oh there is an UPCHARGE for everything ! So after deciding what we wanted I told the waiter -  I would like this flavor -- Oh that's an UPCHARGE, to this SIDE which was to be $1 - Oh that an UPCHARGE. This was all told AFTER the fact.... okay so we settled with the non-UPCHARGED items and ordered.  The menu stated the wings come with Celery - nothing about CARROTS! (which I HATE). The WINGS came out all FROST BIT - so dried up and hard it was UN-eatable!  By the way on my way out there was a table of 'OBVIOUS REGULARS' Big Barley Men - unlike petite me - who had FABULOUS FAT, MOIST & MEATY WINGs - so there is the FAVORITISM also!  The waiter also DID NOT GIVE THE WINGS 1/2 OFF!  After all that & having LOUSY DRIED UP NO MEAT on WINGS served to us -- they were NOT EVEN 1/2 off as promised!  They charged us 7.50 for $9.99 - so they don't even know the MATH!  Doubt this place will last long at all if they continue doing business.  To the Owners of Jack Beagles  Here is a thought for them - STOP UPCHARGING things - it's a MARKETING thing that people come in for a special & try one of YOUR specialties... you think they will come back again?! HUH? Instead you give the lousy flavor out of the can chili that was ssooo nasty & Thin & Burnt (nothing like in their viedo of over night soaked potatoes) which were over cooked not -wedged (as I was told they were) French Fries - I would have called them CHIPS not French Fries cuz they looked like Potato chips to me - round cuts cut in half.  Well you should think about marketing and making people WANT to come back but I bet you won't",

And with the burger came the Mac & cheese, and it was surprisingly good (and I'm kind of a mac & cheese snob). So the food was better than I expected, and the prices were reasonable, so I'd say that's a win-win. Now, if only they'd put up ANY sort of a sign outside identifying the place, more people could find it. So if you're in NoDa, check it out, but be sure you have the address.",

    "text": "Went tonight on the recommendation of other Yelp users, hoping for the best.  There was a table available with no wait, and the service was superb.  Food was outstanding!  Had the Blue Bayou burger, the pulled pork sandwich, and sides of mac and cheese and chili.  EVERYTHING was terrific.  Extremely fast service, great prices, and overall a wonderful surprise.  Had no idea this place was even there, and the other reviewers who mentioned the lack of signage weren't exaggerating.... There is no sign in the front other than a small white board inside the front window with a handwritten \"Jack Beagles\" and the daily special written on it.  Am almost glad it's hard to spot -- Would hate to have to wait for such great food and service if word really got out!  Fabulous!  (We actually recommended the place to a couple that were debating whether or not to go in after they found out about the wait at the place a couple of doors down...... Hope they liked it as much as we did!)  Will definitely go back.  The wings looked really, really good!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went for lunch here today around 1:00pm and we were the only ones there. She ordered a single burger well done and I ordered a Philly cheesesteak. My sandwich came out first and was delicious.  I was going to wait to eat my sandwich when she gots hers, but it became clear that my food was going to get cold so I began to eat. She did not get her burger until after I had finished mine. When the waitress brought her burger we complained about it taking so long and she said \"that's how it always is here\". I said no it's not because we had been here once before and got our food at the same time. On top of that, the burger she brought was a double and not a single as ordered. I would not normally complain about that, but my girlfriend is turned off by double meat and only eats 1\\2 of a single. She refused her burger while the waitress apologized and again said that's how they serve their food. When she says she wished there was something she could do, I suggested that she stop saying \"that's how they do it here\". Because it's not! Pretty lousy experience since I ate but girlfriend was pissed. They didn't charge for her order, but did mine, and I tipped 20%.",

The back patio has a large number of tables, a bar and a sometimes stage with live music.    It's a bit divey and more than casual - making it the perfect place to grab a burger or wings and a beer with absolutely zero pretense.

But I feel like now I need to express my opinion in a truthful manner because I've been in the service industry a very long time. I came in at a decent hour and the bartender didn't have a great attitude which I usually expect. I proceed to order the special and ask for it with one specific item without. I repeat myself more than once. I also ordered some Jack Mack and some waffle fries with a side of beer cheese. At the end of my order I receive the special menu item with the item I requested off. Then they proceed to take it remove that one item and bring it back to me which I refused to eat because some people are sensitive to some foods. I didn't get my mac & cheese even though I got charged for it and they only gave me my waffle fries with the beer cheese. I don't understand why this keeps happening. I still decided to tip even though I probably shouldn't have at all. My yelp review probably doesn't mean anything but I have to confess what keeps happening at this place. It seems like they don't really give a damn about the customer or what they would like to order. I feel like I genuinely wasted 15 bucks.",

Which is filled with many eclectic and fun bars. The abeyance is real cool and laid back. Tables are comfortable and clean. I went for a late lunch on a Monday and was seated as soon as we walked in. The waiter came with water in hand and was ready for our drink orders.( That was great). We came in after viewing the menu on yelp. So we were ready to order.  I got the treasure fries with chili W beans ( don't be like me and let your eyes be bigger then your belly.) i also ordered 12 hot wings 1/2 hot and the other 1/2 hot garlic parm.  The food came out hot and was very good. The fries could have used a lil salt but hey they were still good. The service was great and it's good bar food.  Think I'll try their signature Mac. Don't look at me crazy because I heard it was amazing. Go try it for yourself and let me know what you think!",

The cheese grits were not what I was expecting because it wasn't mixed in, but the worst part is that it was melted on the top and wouldn't mix in with the grits. So I had grits with chunky cheese which didn't taste right. The Classic Beagle was out of this world. Outside of that the rustic warm artistic feel and Irish coffee makes it worth while.",

I love it when the server is a fan! You can tell right away if they like working there and more importantly eating there. I often ask...what's your favorite thing here and when they know right off the bat and their giddy about it that is a good sign! Mel was a fan!   We started with waffle cheese fries - loaded with chili, cheese and peppers! Oh dear Lord! Then we went on two orders of Mac n Cheese - they have such a selection! We asked Mel and she said the Blue Cheese with Bacon and the one with garlic so we listened and so glad we did! Damn they were both good! The blue with bacon was the best though! Then...yes we continued...boneless wings with the sauce that had both BBQ and wing sauce combined. Can't remember the name but ask Mel!   Oh and I almost forgot. I got a blueberry beer that wS on tap...still looking for something similar! So refreshing and light! The hubs went for a local beer \"Birdsong Brewing Company\" brown ale.   Just go...the end! Oh and ask for Mel!!!",

    "text": "We came here after work one day and wasn't too impressed with what we found. We sat at the bar hoping we could get a couple of drinks in. Wednesday's was $1 off whiskey and half off wings, deals we thought would be pretty good. I ordered a fireball  just to gauge prices, and including the discount it was $5...eh not that great since I get $3 fireballs from on the border...  The bar tender took forever to notice us..I literally had to stare her down to get her to come over. She was nice, just not attentive. We ordered a bowl of jack mac, they have 4 different kinds of mac and cheese options with some twists. I can't help myself when it comes to mac so I had to order a bowl to split with the bf. In light of the half of wing wednesdays we ordered a 10pc with hot garlic parm and the spicy mango habanero equivalent.   Didn't take long to come out, that was probably the biggest plus of our meal. The mac and cheese bowl looked like the cup size...seriously tiny and not worth the $6...it had good flavor not amazing and no texture...I wouldn't call this adult mac and cheese. Maybe I just spoil myself with the mac I make at home with all the fixins thrown in. The wings, celery sticks and carrots were sad, soggy and lukewarm...I am 99% sure they were frozen though the website seems to claim otherwise. The flavor of the sauces was good though the mango habanero was NOT SPICY at all...I just wished the quality of the wings and sides were just as good...BWW does wings way better in my opinion..  In addition, the wings were not really half off...they docked on extra 2 dollars because we ordered two different sauces...which is lame. We had an ok experience but I doubt we will be coming back for after work munchies..",

We chose to sit outside at a high top, the patio area was super spacious and wide open, I can see it being amazing on weekends & at night when it gets crowded. The bartender was a dark haired guy who helped me choose a beer & let me sample a few. I decided on a cider that was so crisp & perfect for fall. I had heard great things about their Mac & cheese so it was a must that I try some. I went for the \"Jack Mac\" & it was absolutely stupendous. The perfect amount of kick & garlicky taste on the most perfect noodles with an obnoxious amount of cheese...heaven on earth. The service was really one of the best things about our meal here, the bartender's timing was absolutely perfect & he was so friendly & accommodating. At the end of the meal, there was a problem with my card & I had to charge up my dead phone to use Cash App to pay for my meal. The bartender was so unbelievably kind about the whole thing & I know it was a situation to easily get exasperated with. He provided me with a charger and an outlet to use & was so patient while I jumped through hoops to get my payment right. Never did he catch an attitude, he was smiling & helpful all along. I would highly recommend Jack Beagles to anyone in the NoDa area looking for good drinks, food and service",

And don't forget to grab yourself some hot, crispy and delicious fries! They're thin wedges and damn delicious.   I like me some JackBeagles.",

I dropped in for some late night noms the other night though, and was very pleased.   I wasn't very hungry so I just got fried mushrooms, expecting the little button mushrooms you usually get. Boy was I surprised when these giant slices of fried goodness appeared before me! They went awesome with the horseradish sauce that came with it, a nice change from the typical ranch. My friend got a burger and it looked incredible. I can't wait to find myself hungry in NoDa again.",

Huge difference in flavor guys!! I love me a good glass of sweet tea with my meal. Also, when asked for my biscuit to eat my gravy with, it was literally hard as stone. No kidding. I showed it to the waitress, and she did bring out 2 fresh ones. But, it was a joke at our table. Food was ok... Potatoes/home fries needed more seasoning. Bottom line, I'll be back. But, not for a while to see if they got real tea to serve to their customers.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times since it has opened.  I have to say it is pretty damn good at a nice price.  There are two reasons I gave Jack Beagle's five stars.    First... good drink specials.  The two times I had gone there they had Dale's Pale Ale for $2.50.  I went there on a Sunday and they had $2 Bloody Marys and Mimosas.   **EDIT: They raised the price of Bloodys and Mimosas.  They are now 3.50 and 2.50 respectively.    Second... The best hot dogs in town.  They are smoked hot dogs that can be ordered grilled or fried.  Fried hot dogs do not appeal to me so I went for the grilled.  I ordered one hot dog with chili, slaw, and onions.  The chili they use for the hot dogs is very tasty.  For my second dog I ordered it with a mango chutney and jalapeno relish.  The sweetness of the mango with the spicy of the jalapeno made for a fantastic combination.  Now for the good part... I got two hot dogs and a side of delicious medallion/half-moon shaped fries for about $5 and it is worth it.    I would like to describe Jack Beagle's as cozy.  Jack Beagles is a small place and does not have a great deal of seating.  I did not get the fastest service but I did not seem to mind.  The server seemed new and by herself so will not be holding it against her or the establishment.   I also had the wings and cheese-steak.  Both great eats but I would go for the dogs first.",

When we arrived the music and atmosphere were fun. That was the end of our enjoyable lunch...well, we actually never ate lunch. We sat for several minutes and were never acknowledged. There was 1 other table of patrons and 3 servers standing around doing nothing. One server looked over and made eye contact, but did not come to our table. Finally, she took our drink order (3 soft drinks and a tea). She delivered them, but we still didn't have menus. I had to ask for menus which the server handed to our table without speaking a single word. I can guess that maybe none of the servers had facial muscles because no one smiled or talked. We looked at the menu which included breakfast and late night snacks...neither what we wanted for lunch. I asked for lunch menus and was rudely told they only have breakfast until 1:00. The menu states that breakfast is available until 1--not required until 1. Two of the 4 of us did not even take a sip of our soft drinks, yet when we told the server we were going to leave because we wanted lunch she managed to tell us the bill for our drinks! We had pay over $7!!! Then as we dug in our purses for the money the three servers stood and talked about us...in front of us. You can complain about customers after they leave, but not in front of them. You were in the wrong. You should have thanked us for stopping in and said you hoped we would come back again someday. You should have told us there was no charge for the drinks. This establishment needs to hire new servers with personalities. What a terrible experience!",

And their inventive mac n cheeses never disappoint!   Only downside is that there are only 2 one-room bathrooms, which creates long lines when it's crowded. It's not much worse than a typical bar though, but they're right by the door to the patio so it can get real cramped while you're waiting to go!   Bathrooms aside, this will continue to be a go-to bar for me as I love the atmosphere, food and the drinks of course!",

The food was great (I had takeout that time). I went back yesterday and was amazed that I had found a new HOT SPOT. They are currently building an awesome back patio with a stage and I can't wait for them to finish. As for the food, I had the Blue Cheese Burger with fries and an order of the boneless wings in the Spicy Jack sauce. My friend had the Philly Cheesesteak (he's from Philly). We were totally impressed by the quality and flavor of the food. The burger was cooked exactly how I had asked, and the fries are KILLER. If you're going to get something that introduces you to JB's get the wings with the spicy Jack sauce. I could probably eat 10 lbs. of those!   In addition to the great food is the excellent prices on their craft beers. They do not carry as many as some places in NoDa, but the selection is varied and CHEAP. I will be coming here at least once a week because I want to support places that provide quality to their customers.",

I found myself at JackBeagles in the company of a certain spectacular photographer ;) and the kind owner of this flavorful establishment. Inside, JB's offers cute and cozy bar setting with additional setting in house and out on the patio.  The patio offers a friendly escape from your typical dining environment, and a pretty sweet view! I Likey =) Encompassed by a few tall trees and tiki torches there's just enough light, just enough ambient sound, and the right combination of company that made for an almost vacational dining experience. The patio gives guests the perfect combination of feeling included in the restaurant atmosphere and simultaneously offers seclusion from it, an interesting combination and so amazing!  On to the eats! By recommendation I tried one of the delicious hot-dogs. My toppings of choice.. Cheese Of Course! (And ketchup, and mustard) Let me tell you that my hot dog was so delicious and juicy, it was like Nicolas Cage ... Gone in 60 seconds! And the fries, oh the FRIES! In a word..\" mmmmmm\". Yup that's right, \"mmmmmm.\" No word's necessary, just my delicious and satisfied sound. These fries are the perfect combination of real potato crisp and salt. The fries were soo good I could eat them without ketchup! Gasp!   I look forward to my next visit at JackBeagles. I'll definitely be back to taste a few spirits, and take a bite out of one of JackBeagles fried hot dogs. Mmmm! That is all for now, keep up the great work JackBeagles!",

When I see a beer of this variety available on draft I typically ask for a taste so that I can decide if I would like an entire pour.  I don't need anything more than a drip on my tongue to make up my mind. I found it a bit unnecessary to charge $1 for a taste of this beer. They had Lagunitas IPA so I stuck with an old favorite because I was off put at paying to try the porter.   The servers were attentive in replenishing beverages outside and the prices for beer were as expected. The patio was nicely heated with plenty of seating. I give JackBeagles the thumbs up and will probably have drinks here again but just can't say it is anything more than average.",

When we walked in, the ambiance was artsy, the drink specials were awesome, and the menu was to the point and full of goodness.  I got the Market Steak sandwich (YES. It is AMAZING.) With Chili-Mac on the side. You will think that it's just macaroni and cheese, but the way they make the noodles al-dente and have such a buttery cheese sauce with perfect chili... you cannot pass it up. Don't fall for the gimmicks of murals and colors... this may look like a plain little section of NoDa but it was a highlight of my trip. I will be back.",

JB based on some of the locals I've spoken to live by their Mac & Cheese  which comes in different flavors, my fav is the classic which is awesome to say the least. I have to admit that there is A & C squad. From my experience the later it gets the food quality changes. I've come around 12pm on Friday vs 1:30am on a Saturday and ordered the same thing with different results.   Anyway with all that being said its still an awesome spot and they have events and live music out on the patio. Great group of people and diversity with varying music so a little something for everyone.   I recommend the Mac and try the wings which are great. The hotdogs and chili are also a fav of  mine. JB also steams their drink glasses which was new for me. Coming from NY, that's not something I've seen in high end bars.",

I came here on a night out with the boyfriend. Try all of the mac and cheeses.... they are so good. I also ordered a burger that I cannot remember. It was average.   There was music playing in the background and a great overall vibe. Service was just decent but I know she was hustling.

The band started playing about 10 minutes later. Once the band started playing, it was to loud to talk to anyone ( which I get is common with bands but it's wasn't pleasant). Our server dropped off waters and then disappeared.  Lastly, I walk up to the bar to order a cider and the bartender was trying to tell me about the different types of ciders they have but, it was so loud I couldn't hear her.  She gave me the one on draft, it came in a little 12oz plastic cup. Once I got the bill, they charged me $6.50 for that little glass of cider.  So in the end, this place is really loud, has bad service, and the drinks are expensive. I won't return.",

    "text": "I have neglected to review Jack Beagles for far too long. To me, this place is practically a NoDa staple these days. I can't even think of NoDa without it coming to mind. Nor can I think of mac and cheese without it coming to mind!  If you're up early you can take advantage of their quick and easy one-page breakfast menu with a selection of specialties, omelets or just a regular old American south breakfast - eggs, sausage or bacon, grits or hashbrowns, toast or biscuits. During the day and into your nightly escapades you can have yourself one of their many delectable [hot] dogs or a choice of 4 or 5 different kinds of mac and cheese. I personally love the Blue-Black Mac with bleu cheese, bacon and cracked pepper. I wouldn't want anybody to forget though: they have a full bar. You name it, they'll pour it. Not to mention a regularly update (practically daily) list of local and unusual brews to partake in.  Foodskis and brewskis aside, the ambiance in here is pretty damn sweet. Yeah, I'll admit it's not top-notch, best place you'll ever sit in, mindgasm level. But it works for a bar. Hell the only improvement would be if the place was a bit bigger. Out back they frequently have live bands even on nights when most places in the neighborhood are slowing down and the patio will be pumpin' as the warmer days roll in. And if it's late out and you're drunkenly stumbling in there's their unmistakable ID checker guy out front on a bar stool as usual waiting to draw a happy smiley face on your hand. A night out in NoDa REQUIRES a stop here.",

We both had macaroni and cheese but were so full we couldn't eat it so it's currently in our fridge. Overall, the food was okay but nothing that I left raving about.   Service: while we liked our waitress, we were both unimpressed with the time it took for our food to come out. We noticed other tables had quite a long wait for their food as well.

    "text": "Normally I would rate Jack Beagle's at least 4 stars, but this was a terrible experience. The problem appears to be they are not a breakfast joint. Took 35 minutes to get bacon and eggs and there were only 3 other tables in the place, all of whom already had their food. The server explained they were training kitchen staff. Toast was cold, eggs tasted like they had been cooked in a dirty pan, and the grits, which is the one thing I come here for tasted like instant. Huge disappointment. I guess we will stick with the dinner menu.   Update: we've been to JB's twice since the lousy breakfast experience and both times were just awful. This place has really gone downhill over the past year. The service is friendly enough but SO SLOOOWWWW! I waited 46 minutes for this last night. It was not a complicated order, and when I asked the sever to check on it after 40 minutes the excuse I was given was \"the fries are taking awhile to cook.\" I told her to ditch the fries and give it to me to go. By the time we left it was 10:00 pm, and I just wanted to leave. So for $11 this is what I got...yea, I got charged extra for the sauce",

But it seems a price jump has them charging $11 for a burger with no side, which is absolutely crazy. It makes me really really sad to say I won't be back because I can go to 40 other bars in charlotte and get a burger and side for less than the price of just one burger there. Sad day, jack beagles.",

    "text": "This will be a painfully honest review of Jack Beagles. We had heard from friends that Jack Beagles was a great place to come for food and drinks, so we took them up on their recommendation. We arrived at approximately 5 pm on a Saturday evening. It was not super busy, as we walked in we stood at the door for approximately 3 minutes before anybody told us to sit wherever we want, which was after the group of waitresses and waiters finished their conversation. Once we sat down, we were offered water and the waitress we had asked us if we wanted anything to drink, my wife was fine with water and I ordered a draft beer which promptly came out. We placed our order with the waitress, and she asked for my credit card for the tab. I was a little confused by this as we were sitting in the dinning area. I think she said it had something to do with people walking off, but I couldn't exactly here her with the loud music and background noise. So I paid for entire meal ahead of time which was a first for a sit down restaurant. My black and blue burger came out, I'll be honest it was very good. The chicken wrap that my wife ordered came out approximately 5 minutes after my burger, I don't know if the cook doesn't know how to pace an order or what? My wife was only able to finish half of her meal, as the salsa that was in the chicken wrap made the tortilla soggy and unable to pick up with out falling apart. I'm very disappointed with Jack Beagles after such a recommendation. Just being honest.",

Apparently, it was brand new the first time I went which explained why I wasn't sure how I ended up in this place or why I had never heard of it. It began as any awesome place should. Small menu on a piece of paper, drink specials on the board, fun wait/bar staff and a casual, artsy atmosphere. First impression was that it is s.m.a.l.l. I wondered how we would fit a large group in here on a Friday night while we're bar hopping, but do not fear. We've done it successfully many times since then. After gathering my visual impressions, I ordered a beer the waitress suggested and some food and all I can say is HOLY. The beer was a cider-type something or another and it was sweet, light and delicious. The food was a California Philly. I didn't think I'd like the food but I gave it a shot and I am SO GLAD. The fries are more like thin potato wedges with spices and they're fantastic. I love a bar with unique fries - makes a lasting impression. I've since tried almost all of the menu items (which they continue adding to) and I love it all from appetizers to entrees to the new breakfast menu to the excellent beer selection. Double date night coming up? Hungry after bar hopping? Not sure what to get for dinner on random Tuesday night? Jack Beagles has NEVER let me down.",

THEN..... the check came.  It was half price wing night.  3 people at the table ordered 12 wings.  On the menu 6 wings are $5.99 and 12 wings are $9.99.  This should put our orders at $5 each.  We were all charged for 2 orders of 6 totaling $6.50.  None of that makes any sense to me except incorrect ordering on her part, possibly trying to up the check average, and incorrect pricing on the menu. Everyone at the table is in the bar/restaurant business and noticed the problem too late.  This will definitely stay in our head the next time we want to go out to eat, which we do a LOT.",

It's really laid back and cozy.  The outdoor patio is heated in the winter and has live entertainment.  The prices are really reasonable for an up and coming neighborhood like NoDa.

The atmosphere was great and I was ready for some great Hot dogs in the Charlotte area. 4 different hot dogs were ordered at my table and when being served all were so wrong that we looked confused. Might I add that it too almost 35 minutes to receive our food at 6:30pm on a Tuesday. Questioned by the waitress we explained that we couldn't figure out how to give the right hot dog to who ordered what. The food was returned for a recook and 5-7 minutes later we had our correct hot dogs. However, this time the hot dogs were still cold, the buns were cold, toppings were perfect, and the fries were from the original plate. I tasted the jalapeno relish and fell in LOVE!! Regardless of how bad the first visit was I will be back to retry and finally have a hot dog location in Charlotte. TRY THE JALAPENO RELISH!!",

This was my first time here, but the burgers were recommended by our friends and I ordered the classic cheeseburger, while the wife had the vegetable pita wrap. I also ordered a Hopulent IPA, which they had on draft, among the 8 or so draft beers that they had to offer.  Burger meat was cooked medium since the waitress asked about my preference and my burger was juicy, but not really greasy.  The standard toppings included lettuce, tomato and onions.  I did not get a side, since we were just getting a snack and I was not too hungry, but I guess those are extra.  I really enjoyed their basic burger and would certainly try another one of their signature burgers next time. The wife enjoyed her vegetable wrap, but found it a bit greasy due to the amount of cheese on the inside.  She actually removed a good bit of the cheese, and would probably try something else in the future or maybe holding the cheese on the veggie wrap.  The atmosphere was cool inside, as it was an old brick building that was a manufacturing plant in the past before it was converted to a restaurant/bar.  It was a little hot inside the place, probably due to the central open kitchen and the fact that it was 100 degrees that day.  I would return on a cooler day with no hesitation.",

They have breakfast wraps and tweaks to your standard breakfast fare.  Next time, I will venture for the Shit on a Shingle.  Up north, that is creamed chipped beef on toast.  There, it is more like your sausage biscuits and gravy only on texas toast. All of it is reasonably priced and a great breakfast option in the hood that is open early.

Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "I will typically try the Mac and cheese wherever I go because, hey, why not?  What I can tell you is that Jack Beagles has the best mac and cheese in town.  With options like Blue Black Mac, Chili Mac, and Mexi Mac, what's not to like?  I've tried nearly all of them at this point and they are all stellar. My favorite though is probably the Blue Black Mac. Their burgers are good but there are definitely better in Charlotte (Cowbell and Kickstand to name a few).   Not a place that necessarily sticks out in Noda but certainly a good choice for those tired of some of the staples in the area.  I like the fact that this is more of a low key spot where you can relax and grab a good meal.   Oh, and by the way, they have a nice bar for those looking to grab a beer.",

Low key atmosphere. Friendly staff. Great prices. Killer tunes. Unique beer selection. Nice patio area. They serve food late night and offer a fantastic breakfast menu on the weekends.  The wings are tremendous. Wednesday is half price wing night and $1 off whiskey. If you're with friends... I recommend hot garlic parmesan. Outstanding. Skip these if you're on a date. Well, unless your sidekick also wants them. Then I guess you can follow the rule of the couple who eats garlic together stays together.  Jacks also serves a mean hot dog. Be sure to get jalapeno relish on it. And don't forget an order of fries. Think thin wedges of heavenly potato goodness. You can also get these buried treasure style... loaded with a laundry list of toppings.  This is a must visit place if you are ever in the NoDa area",

    "text": "Looking for a bar with good food, good drinks, a friendly staff, and nice people? Well normally I would tell you to keep dreaming because no bar has all of things at once right? That's what I used to say before I went to JackBeagles!  I first discovered this place a couple of years ago while hanging out in NoDa shortly after moving to Charlotte.  Since then I've been back several times.    The staff is always friendly, it's like they actually enjoy their jobs and want to be there.  I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience here with any of them over the years.  I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the other patrons are and how inviting the atmosphere is at a whole.  One of the  few bars I've come to where you can really just sit down and feel free talk to anyone. Just about everyone seems to be having a good time enjoying their food/drinks and very social.  I've met all kinds of people here.  If you come during evening hours they usually have some good music playing in the background as well.  But enough about the people, let's talk about the food.  First I have to get into the Mac n Cheese because this is the dish that's going to keep most coming back.  JackBeagles has hands down some of the best Mac n Cheese I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of mac n cheese).  They have several different styles but if it's your first time then I recommend starting with the signature Jack's Mac.  Prepare to be blown away.  On your subsequent visits (because you'll probably come back), feel free to try the other flavors as they're all amazing.  My other favorite is the Mexi-Mac.  If you need something more then you have to try one of their hot dogs.  Trust me all you need is 1.  These things pack a delicious wallop.  For the bravest souls I have to suggest the Buried Treasure Fries.  These aren't your traditional cheese fries.  Once you order them and see all the things topped onto them, you'll realize why they're called \"buried treasure\" fries.   You might want to share these with your date as it's quite a bit for one person to handle.  I can't recommend this place enough.  If you're only in Charlotte for a short amount of time and want to experience a good bar atmosphere and at the same time grab a delicious meal, head to JackBeagles.  Good thing I don't live in this part of town or else they'd have all my money haha.",

For being a \"dive bar\" the menu is surprisingly large; perhaps not the most vegetarian options but if you are a vegetarian just order two mac bowls and you will leave happy!",

They had a great beer selection but I'm not a beer girl. I drink cider which I know I know is not really beer but it's the closest I can do. But with $1 off whiskey and a good cider the place had me. I had the Classic Beagle medium well and asked for caramelized instead of raw onion. They were happy to oblige. The burger was delicious, it wasn't overlooked, and was quite juicy. The waffle fries were seasoned and quite tasty. Craving a good burger or some hearty food and this is your place. The drinks are good. The music is solid. The staff is very welcoming and the service was great.",

Our waiter was pleasant but the whole time I kept thinking about how rude it was that we were ignored and not greeted or told we could seat ourselves. I ordered the cheesesteak, hotdog, and macaroni. The cheesesteak was ok. Not the best. The hot dog was pretty good. The mac and cheese was very good. Overall the experience wasn't the best and the food was decent.

    "text": "If you're going to JackBeagles, you're getting one of the mac and cheeses. That's just a fact, right? There's a mini menu of mac and cheeses to cover any taste-buds which means order them all if you show up with a severe mac and cheese craving.   During my visit, I went with the classic mac and cheese as a side to the outdoor-style hot dog (outdoor-style = grilled) to accompany an order of wings for the table. Personally, the mac and cheese was the winner, followed by the wings and then the hot dog. I think I should've ordered more toppings for the hot dog so that's on me to change the next time I visit.  I visited on a beautiful Saturday afternoon right after the brunch was finished being served and sat out on the back patio since one of my dining companions was a sweet little pup. There were plenty of dogs out back that provided some entertainment for the humans and fellow dogs.  I found Jackbeagles to be extremely laid back with surprisingly good food.",

It's all great, the waffle fries, cheesesteaks, wings, and wow, an incredible brunch. There are 5$ BIG mimosas and they do not skimp on the champagne. Totally recommend this place to watch a game and just relax!  PS the chicken gravy biscuit was only $8 for 2 large biscuits per order!!!!",

Their classic beagle burger was really good but caution to anyone looking for a full meal- it does not come with any sides. Live music at their outdoor bar gave the place a fun vibe. Fabulous place to go with a group of friends for a night on the town! Be aware, this is a fun bar type atmosphere so it does get noisy. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a quiet dinner conversation.   There is nearby public parking for $3-5 so since you are paying to park already, I would recommend not just going to dinner but also checking out the other nearby shops on the street.",

I've had real kimchi before. What they serve is essentially sauerkraut covered in an Asian sauce. Really the worst burger in terms of toppings I've had. I also had some of their Mac and cheese- which is great but I ordered it as my side and got charged full price after I asked many times about the sizes and prices. Then the waiter was incredibly rude about it. The place could be really great if they got their act together.",

Their food is second to none and I thoroughly enjoy almost everything on the menu.  Can't beat the weekend breakfast options whether that be the breakfast hoagie, the breakfast special or beagles breakfast (you get some real solid Texas Toast). The Lunch & Dinner menu is phenomenal as well, the wings are as Tony the Tiger would say, \"Grrrrrrrrrrreat\", the steak and cheese is mouth watering, and I can't forget the heart attack you get from eating all of their mac and cheese (its a good heart attack trust me, you'll bounce right back soon enough).  Their draft beer selection is always full of several local brews (I prefer the Noda Brewing Company brewskis).  It seems as if there is always something going on here, so it's a great place for a newbie to the neighborhood to meet some new friends (live music being among the events).  I plan on getting myself a breakfast hoagie this weekend so I'll see y'all there (along with several bloody marys as well).",

    "text": "Wings and mac and cheese. Done!  - That should be enough to get you through the door, right?   If you're confused as to where this NoDa gem is located... look for Cabo and it's on the opposite end of the same block. As expected, parking is at your own risks, so find somewhere and walk on over to join the crowd. The food will put an end to any complaints in the event you're just a passenger.   At first glance, the place seems small and you're probably looking around to see where you can wait for an open table. The hidden treasure is the back patio with a second full bar. The patio has more TVs and larger tables for larger groups, but you may need a coat once the temperature drops.   Luckily, a few chairs opened up at the first bar so my friends and I were able to grab a spot and quickly order our drinks. There were a few specials available, so be sure to check the (lighted) list to the left of the bar before placing an order. We were informed that the kitchen was running behind, so our food would take a little longer than normal. I always appreciate a heads up before making my food order, if the kitchen is running behind, so the bartender was already turning into my best friend.   After ordering a dozen wings I was pleased to see that they weren't tiny wings that some pubs like to offer and if I must say... give the Cajun and Jack's Hot Garlic Parmesan a try, thank me later. The only setback was the fact that I smelled like I'd been cooking the food myself, as sitting at the bar resulted in my jacket smelling like french fries upon my departure. However, that's not enough to keep me from this place.   Hope you take part in all the mac and cheese options they have to offer!!",

They have a delicious menu, but the only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because of their terrible service recently. For some reason they have been opening at noon on the weekends, instead of their normal 9am opening time. The staff does not answer the phone or have a voicemail setup that says why they aren't answering and why they aren't opening until noon. I have been trying to eat breakfast here for the past three weeks  and each time we have called ahead to pick up, we have been directed to voicemail or if it was past noon, they say they are no longer serving breakfast (one day we waited THREE HOURS until their noon opening time just to have them tell us breakfast is no longer available - thanks for starving me).  Today, I called three times, no answer. I physically drive to the restaurant and see their handwritten note saying they don't open until noon. I am disappointed that I had to physically see the sign in person to know what is going on. It is frustrating that they are not clear with their customers on their schedule both online (Yelp) and over the phone.   Jack Beagles staff - please fix this as I've been wanting your breakfast burrito for WEEKS and you guys are preventing me. Thanks.",

    "text": "Oooooooh Beagles, how do I love thee, but the last 2 nights in a row you hustled me on my tab.  I really hope this rant doesn't affect my future service at this place, even with the bad rating I will return and hopefully update this with a higher rating in the future.  I can't not come here, its probably the best place in NoDa for a reasonably priced food and beer.  That patio will be rockin in the spring.  I'll tell the 2 stories though.  The first night I ordered a ripper, awesome dog for the money.  I got the special tropical version with mango.  Soooo tasty and I'm not a hotdog lover.  It says on the menu $2.99, $1 more for a jumbo.  I would assume that that means it would come to 3.99, but it rings up 4.50.  I asked my waitress about this and she said nobody had ever complained before.  I told her that it didn't really matter that nobody had noticed the overcharge I wasn't going to pay it.  She said she couldn't do anything about and got the manager.  He was seemed friendly at first but then actually had the nerve to tell me \"its only .50\", I agreed with him.  Yes, its only .50, but it took some bickering back and forth before I could it taken off.  If the customer catches you overcharging, don't argue with me about it.  Ironically, I was hilariously talking NASCAR with the owner at the table next to us but I don't think he noticed what was going on.  I still tipped the waitress $5 on this small tab, just to let her know it was the principle of the matter, not me being a cheap ass.  But, I still love this place, so I came back the next night.  It seemed like the perfect segway between the Triple C elite event and the absolutely amazing Emancipator show at the neighborhood theater.  Plus, they had hop slam and 1/2 priced wings, or at least advertised half priced wings.  I ordered 12 wings, the menu says they are $9.99 and the specials board said half priced wings, so that comes to $6.50 right?  No, half of $10 is $5, easy math I thought.  When I asked about it, I was told that the half priced deal is only on the 6 wings and I didn't order 12 wings, I ordered to orders of 6.  I thought that 6 wings were only $6, not $6.50 as well, but maybe I was mistaken.  This time I didn't make quite as big of a deal about it as it was still a good deal.  But then, as we started to leave my friend noticed her purse had been sitting in a pool of water that they neglected to clean up.  Her key FOB for her car was ruined and all of here business cards were as well.  Not completely their fault as the customer who did it should have fessed up, but PLEASE get your $@!^ together people.  Moral of the story is, this place is awesome and the prices are fair, but please just let me know if you are going to charge me more than what the menu states, maybe if I was drunk I wouldn't notice, but that practice just ain't right.",

Going inside Jack Beagles did not help me out with either of those things.  First it took about 40 minutes to receive our food. Our waitress just sort of stared over at our table wondering what the hell we were still doing there while talking to friends and the bartender. During this 40 minute time period the fans were turned up to such an astronomical speed that in my winter jacket i was freezing to death. We asked our waitress if there was anything to be done and once again she just stared at us like we were the biggest morons to ever grace her presence. We noticed a lot of other patrons becoming really cold too, so it wasn't just me being a baby either. It wasn't until my friend got up and told her we were going to walk out that they finally, oh god, finally turned them off. Oh and then the air conditioning kicked on and blew right onto our table. Thanks guys.  I ordered a burger that was supposed to have cheese, bacon and jalapenos. This burger had so many jalapenos that it was literally just a jalapeno burger. The burger was just this really super weird combination of blandness and burning of my stomach lining. My friend got fries with cheese and gravy. I ate one fry and wanted to die. Not because it was good, but because if that's what passes as gravy these days I no longer wanted to live.",

The best asset is the back patio and it looks like they are putting more money into to make it even nicer.  Nice little stage for a local band to play certainly creates a nice environment to come and kick back.",

    "text": "JackBeagles has recently become my \"go-to\" for a weekend breakfast...it's like a Budweiser: always fills me up, and never lets me down.   I think it's always a good idea for a restaurant to keep a simple menu, execute a couple of items that you do really well, and don't overcomplicate or spread yourself too thin by trying to appease everyone. I think JBs really embraces this concept; they stick to a few basics, throw in a special or two, and keep the prices very reasonable.   As for the building, I've always just walked in the front door (push don't pull), and sat right at the bar. I'd probably just classify it more as \"counter-service\" than bar, as the kitchen is visible and somewhat open, and the service up front has always been efficient. Side note: I like that the coffee mugs are just a random assortment from local businesses that they probably got for free...It's kinda like a koozie, it's always better to collect them rather than buy them.    The inside has a real laid-back vibe, and you'll usually catch a couple of people at the bar completing a crossword puzzle, or just there sipping on some coffee. Striking up conversations with others is typically easy & comfortable.   As mentioned before, I've only been for breakfast---but I'll definitely check out their lunch/dinner options if I'm ever bar hopping around NoDa some night.",

I ordered a classic burger with a side of mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork salad. The burger was pretty good, but I was expecting to be REALLY blown away based on these reviews. As for the mac and cheese... eh. I like mine to be creamy and unbaked. I was hoping for more with that whole little menu of mac and cheeses and was very underwhelmed. (My boyfriend did like his salad.)  The service was not great. We waited over half an hour for a burger and a salad in a mostly empty restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was particularly professional. I don't mind a little wait, but this didn't seem proportional to what we ordered.  I really wanted to like it here, but based on my experience, I will not be back next time I'm around Charlotte.",

He raved about the wings and the mac and cheese and I have to admit he was correct although I have fell in love with the cheese steaks, usually the Widowmaker but more recently the Stugots. Words cannot describe how delicious this sandwich is. Bread is nice and soft and the pepperoni gives it a different flavor. Would definitely recommend. The atmosphere in Jack beagles is pretty cool and laid-back. We like to head out back to the patio and listen to live music. I knew they were dog friendly but for some reason I never paid attention to it. If I had to have a complaint about anything it would be how employees come and pet dogs and then they are around food. Now I didn't see my server do this but I did see several employees pet the dogs there on the patio and then go serve food. Now I know that pets are like some people's children but I would prefer if the person that is handling my food not just get licked by a dog. Other than that I love Jack beagles and will continue to frequent this establishment. I'll just make sure I keep a hawk eye on my server.",

JackBeagles has been around for a year and a half, and it's so low-key that we drove right past it and had to narrow down the location based on the address (it's in between Cabo Fish Taco and Salvador Deli, but we didn't see a sign).    We got there around 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, and the place was about half full.  It's definitely a bar that just happens to serve food, and we were immediately greeted when we walk in.  Great service, friendly staff and absolutely delicious food.  We both ordered the Beagle Breakfast, which is 2 eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes/grits and toast/biscuit, and neither of us could stop raving about how good it was.  I'm not even a biscuit fan, but theirs was awesome - light and dense all at the same time.  The eggs were super fluffy, the sausage patties were sweet and smoky, and the potatoes had a little kick.  The menu is fairly limited, but this is definitely a case of do a handful of things and do them really well.  Next time, I might have to get the S%!# on a Shingle, just for the fun of it.",

You can get a hot dog, with variety of toppings (I usually get mine grilled with sauerkraut and spicy mustard), for just $2.50, add a side, like fries or coleslaw, for $1. Best deal EVER! Beers on tap are local and are changed frequently. Addition: The macaroni and cheese is to die for.  The music is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get. I've heard Prince, Smashing Pumpkins, TLC, it's all over, but usually themed for the night, i.e. the night I heard TLC was mid-late 90s hits. Sometimes it's 70s funk, or 80s rock.... Aaaand it's awesome. You get the picture.   Our favorite bartender is Kristin or \"Bunny.\" She's attentive, efficient, and super sweet and pleasant.   There isn't much seating, so if you're a group of 5 or more, good luck with grabbing a table inside. I think they have live music out back and more seating, but smoking's  allowed (it's outdoors).  To sum it up: Jack Beagle's is a hipster dive bar, with good music, decent beer selection, and low prices. It's completely unpretentious and is, what I think, the jewel of NoDa.",

I understand the transition to lunch but to sit and can't order any food for 30 minutes is ridiculous! Spoke to the manger about it and  she asserts breakfast ends at 12:59. Yeah ok, so I should have been literally 30 seconds earlier.  All I wanted to do was sit down,  drink a mimosa and eat a scrambled egg... I guess 30 seconds eliminated that's possibility.

No matter if you show up for Trivia on Tuesdays, to watch the game on Sunday or to just relax after a bike ride, Beagles is sure to make you happy.  Oh and their \"Jack Mac\" mac & cheese.. stupid good.  And you've gotta love a bar that has no sign out front :)",

Easy watering hole for the NoDa walker in us all, and plenty of bar food to fill the bellies of those pounding copious amounts of brewskies or other unmentionable swill.   Gotta say I love the Rippers. I'm a fan of a hot dog just about any day of the week and JB's was right on the money. I like a little bit of char on my dog, a little white onion, relish and yellow mustard. However, \"ripped,\" means split and deep fried. What the eff?! Who knew hotdogs could be more awesome.   Plenty of beer to choose from here. Love that they have a good variety of bottles, too.   Where I can't say this is my go-to spot for dinner or food in general when in NoDa, I really want to check out the brunch. With \"Shit on a Shingle,\" which I haven't had in years, these guys have piqued my interest for a future Sunday brunch spot.",

It's a little rough around the edges and grimey but it fills a niche. Enjoyed a few too many beers at Salud and need a little greasy food to sober up? Head to Jack Beagles! Arrive to Haberdish to find a 2-hour wait and want to grab a few drinks while you wait? Head to Jack Beagles! Hung over as hell on Sunday and need some bar grub to bounce back? Head to Jack Beagles!  I try to avoid their draft beers as they always taste a little off. (I'm not sure they clean their lines enough for my admittedly snobby beer tastes.) Good news is they have a ton of bottles and cans. Plus prosecco. You can never go wrong with prosecco.   They crank out some really good bar food. My favorites include the boneless wings with barbalo sauce and any/all their mac and cheeses. Ted loves their buried treasure fries. I always sneak a few and can't argue with waffle fries covered in cheese, onions, peppers, sausage, etc.",

We started with wings and added waffle fries for $1. The wings were ok, sauce was great but wings were plain. Just warm chicken and skin with sauce on bottom of plate- next time I would ask that they be grilled, fried or charred. This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  But we did not go there for chicken wings we went for burgers! We were not disappointed. I had the classic with American cheese, Little mayo, lettuce , onion and tomato on a great roll. My son ordered the bleu cheese burger which was covered with yummy toppings and perfectly cooked. I cannot say enough about how good though rolls are, like a kaiser roll but not as doughy. Great beer, great service, great burgers and fun venue.",

The chef was in rare form and was very entertaining (the kitchen is sort of behind the bar). They turn out some great food from a tiny little kitchen.    They had Coco Loco from NoDa Brewing in bottles. yum!  I ordered the cheesesteak and fries.  This was in the top 3 best cheesesteaks I have ever eaten.  The steak especially had excellent flavor.  Peppers and onions were cooked well.  Cheese was correctly portioned so as not to overpower the steak.  Bread was fresh.  Fries were good.  We overheard the staff talking about the live music that was about to start so we moved outside to the patio and grabbed a table. Soon enough the acoustic goodness started.  The outside area was packed as well and so loud that we couldn't hear very well but it was a very nice outside area with additional bar and lots of seating.  I wish this place was in my neighborhood!",

Best part being they have a fairly comprehensive vegetarian/vegan selection in what typically wouldn't offer such fare.   Great drink selection with draft and can beers; full bar and the staff is awesome.   We've been in 4 times since living here for a year, and the most recent 3 times have been within 6 weeks because of how good of an experience we've had.   We're not the type to crave a conversation with our bartender while bellies up, but it's sure nice to have human interaction. Too many Noda bars are focused entirely on service and ignore the human experience piece that we enjoy - not to mention that being the arts district m/neighborhood in a city you'd probably expect some sort of personal service. I enjoy getting recommendations from the staff and this place is happy to oblige. Plus, unlike other Noda joints, they don't make you feel like they always have another table, another order, or another plate to run. It's a much friendlier experience than some of the other spots in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "If you're looking for atmosphere, this place has it. If you're looking for delicious food, I'd warn you to steer clear of here.  Came here on a busy Friday night. Tables turned quick enough for there to not be a wait. We walked right in and sat right down. We looked at the beer menu and while a decent size, I wasn't impressed. I don't know much about beer but I do love fun beers and I think there were about 4 of 5 to choose from. Not my style so I didn't order-no biggie. I'm here for the food anyway.  My boyfriend was in the mood for a burger and I was intrigued by their Mac n cheese. There were only three burgers to choose from. Meh. I got a pretty basic spicy one. Buzz words for my burger: roasted jalapeno, wasabi mayo, pepper jack cheese. Yes. I love spicy. I also decided upon the Stadium Mac n Cheese because it had beer cheese and a hot dog and pretzel on top(yum! Sounded like it was going to bring me back to my baseball fan years). My boyfriend and I are low carb so we got no buns for our burgers. ( I wanted my carbs to be from the Mac n cheese since that was a different dish). My boyfriend got the bacon and blue cheese burger and fried mushrooms.  Everything came out at the same time. The fried mushrooms, which should take maybe 5 min to make, came out last. *Confused emoji* My mac n cheese  looked and tasted like it had been sitting in the window, but unfortunately I think that just how it was supposed to taste.  I was bummed by everything we ate. My burger was definitely a basic burger. Like, those burgers you eat just because you're drinking. The ones that just make you sad and depressed about your life. There was nothing fun about this...actually I take that back, that wasabi mayo was pretty good and different, but that was the only thing I liked about the burger. Easily could have made one 1,000x better at home.  My Mac and Cheese. SAD SAD FACE! This dish had SO much potential! Beer cheese is amazing. This beer cheese was not. I tasted no beer at all. It's a STADIUM Mac n Cheese! I need beer flavor! The macaroni tasted like this cheap stuff my mom used to buy for us growing up. .99 cheap from a discount grocery store in a box by a brand so \"off\" you wonder if it's even made out of anything real. The same goes for the hotdog. Cheap skinny hotdogs. Man, when I go to a baseball game I'm going for the FOOD. Big fat steamed ballpark dogs! This, was not that. And lastly, the pretzel. Oh man. Here in my mind I was thinking it was a soft pretzel (because isn't that what you get at a baseball game?) but again, so much disappointment. It was a rock hard pretzel stick smashed in the back and sprinkled on my .99 cent macaroni. Wow. I was like, ultra disappointed. So much that the whole night I was talking about going out on the town because we NEVER go out. Yeah, after this dinner I just wanted to go to bed. Which we did. I had three bites of my Mac n cheese and left it. Literally that bad.   I feel like I need not to go into explanation about how disappointing the fried mushrooms were.They weren't those big fat juicy kind. Very dry and shriveled. Soooo basically you're eating fried batter.   Here's the thing. My boyfriend, who doesn't care a lick about food. Said everything was great. Haha.  So long story short: if you care not about food and want a great social spot, come here. The atmosphere was pretty fun. But if you enjoy taste and innovative food then this is not the place for you!",

Because this was a sunny, warm, winter day in NoDa, there were some crazy waits at Cabo.    I had been to Jack Beagles once before for a quick bite and thought it'd be the perfect place.  We had a bit of a wait because all eight of the tables were taken and the patio wasn't quite open.  It was odd hanging out by the door waiting for a table with no recognition from the staff.  We finally got a table and were greeted by our waitress.  I ordered mac & cheese - the one with the pepper jack cheese.  A friend of mine, who loves everything super hot, ordered the hottest wings that they have.  The food didn't all come out at the same time, which was a bit weird, but it was all super good.   I need to go back and try other mac & cheeses.  I love that a bowl is filling, but also easy on the wallet.",

Nice area out back for us smokers, (boo hiss) but also great for dogs.

It was a very inviting atmosphere and the staff was friendly. As I checked out the menu, I noticed that they gave many of the dishes colorful nicknames. I thought to myself, this concept can either create a local legend or go horribly awry. At that very moment, I saw a cheesesteak they offered called \"the stugots\", which is Italian slang for a variation of \"stu cazz\" or \"stu cazzo\" i.e. \"My d**k\" or \"my balls\", or \"my d**k AND my balls\"; terms used interchangeably to express ones defiance or disbelief in something or someone (courtesy translation for the ethnically challenged). Needless to say, I had the cajones to order the stugots. I asked the chef to add green peppers as they were not listed in the menu description. He balked at the idea for a second, but then threw a few on the grill with the onions, steak and pepperoni as per my request. The result...boom. It kicked off like a loose forward. I have since drastically reduced the amount of red meat in my diet. If you are likewise, they offer it with chicken as a no-cost substitute.They have a pretty good beer selection as well.",

I then made a joke, and was pushed out the door despite the fact that I was not resisting or denying leaving whatsoever. He just said \"Then you can get out again\" and pushed me. \"Escorting\" and pushing are two wildly different actions. I don't think that's fair or professional. After the owner of another business who witnessed the whole thing reasoned with him, he then told me I could come inside.

    "text": "Again, I wish Yelp had half stars, because this was a 3.5 experience for me.   I ordered the CHEESESTEAK with onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. I chose melted provolone as my cheese. I asked them to hold the mayo, because mayonnaise on a Philly cheesesteak is sacrilegious. I drank a STONE IPA, which paired well with the sandwich. (Harpoon IPA was on tap, but I didn't notice that until later.) Total price for my meal was a few pennies over $12.  I sat at the bar and watched the short order cook prepare my meal, to see if I could learn any secrets - I didn't. The cheesesteak took about ten minutes to arrive, smoldering lava hot. I liked the components, which were plentiful, and well cooked. The line cook used grilled steak, and definitely not \"Steak Ums.\" I especially enjoyed the nice crusty bread. The sandwich lacked something tastewise, which was hard to pin down. I'm not saying that it was bad, or that I was disappointed, it just lacked some \"oomph.\" There was no salt or pepper added to the meat, so that would have helped somewhat. At home, I would also have added a few shakes of garlic powder. Cheez Whiz would have added significantly to the authenticity of the taste. I've had better cheesesteaks, but I've had far, FAR worse. Portofino's/East still remains my benchmark for CLT. I haven't tried the food trucks - YET, but I will.   My barstool neighbor was downing mixed drinks, and munching on WINGS with ranch dip and celery hearts. Both the drink and his food looked good.  A mother came in, accompanied by her small daughter. The female bartender told them that Jack Beagles makes a great BURGER. I watched this being prepared, and it surely looked delicious. I would probably order that next time. It seems that almost every other reviewer says their mac 'n cheese is amazing, so that would be a \"must try\" eventually as well.   SERVICE was very good. The female bartender was friendly and properly attentive. I didn't have to wait for anything. There were a couple of loud young guys bragging on their drinking prowess, but no one was being overly obnoxious. The female bartender deftly kept them in check.   I love the RELAXED ATMOSPHERE of Jack Beagle's and the wonderful LOCATION.   There were large size TV's over the bar.   I found the place to be very CLEAN.    This place makes me wish that I lived in NODA.",

The food was actually done and the customer service was actually comparable favourably with other burger joints I've been to. However, the last time, I feel as if they were sequestered (on a Wednesday Night 22 July). My order came within a reasonable timeframe, yet the order was not the way I ordered it. I ordered a burger with no jalapenos or Chipotle aioli. Secondly, they must remember that the customers do not want to see the underwear of your cooks, so their britches needed to be pulled up at all times. Thirdly, when someone say \"well done\", it should be well done, not medium rare. I would love not to die of botulism.   I'll give Jackbeagles another try within the next 3 weeks. If no noticeable changes occur, I'll not return.",

I tried to order wine (because that's what I know) but they didn't have a Riesling or Moscato. Bummer.   So why the 5 star rating? The food was phenomenal! I ordered the chicken philly and it was delicious! We also ordered the waffle fries with cheese, onions, jalapenos, and tomatoes and boy was it good!  I told the waitress I'm one of those people who need a drink menu because I don't know alcohol and what mixer goes well with it. She asked what type of drinks I like, and I told her and she came back with a delicious tall glass of goodness! Now that's great customer service!",

    "text": "This review is based solely on my take-out experience and my lack of knowledge about the Impossible burger at the time.   I wanted to try the Vegan's Paradise burger, which is the Impossible burger with cheese, lettuce, etc. I called in the order for pick up. Upon my arrival, I was asked for my ID. I left it in the car because it didn't occur to me that I would need it, as I had never been here before. I told the guy that I was there just for take-out. He informed me that I would normally need an ID so to have it next time. My order was ready when I arrived.  The burger really was good, I must say. However, in all of the recent Impossible burger hype, I've since done some research and will never eat it again. Not just from here, but anywhere. So this decision has nothing to do with this establishment.  I will say that the mood in the place was electric. There was loud music and it was pretty crowded and a party atmosphere.",

    "text": "So I've been here once before and I've also ordered them on Postmates. The food has always been good. Such a great cool vibe for some casual food on a Friday night. The music is great and it's just really chill and laid back. Much like anything else in Noda.  So, unless you've been living under a rock you know that their staple is their loaded mac and cheese dishes. They have about 7 and the all look awesome! Wasn't feeling mac and cheese tonight but in the sprit of \"it's Friday and the diet is out the window until Monday\" I got one of their loaded fries. I ordered \"the rabbit\" which are waffle fries with feta, sweet onions, tomatoes and cheddar drizzled with ranch dressing. So church... What's missing??? Oh yes... BACON! Amen! Life is better with bacon... And a apperently so is \"the rabbit\".  I ordered the wings and though I wanted 2 flavors they only come in a denomination of 6 and they won't allow you to get 2 flavors unless you get 12. #Bummer! That's just too many wings for me. I got Cajun and they were delicious. A bit salty but really tasty. My wife got the chicken Philly which was equally as delicious. Will certainly come here again next time I want some comfort food.  Room for improvement: - Cocktail menu - Allow 2 flavors of wings with a single order",

    "text": "with a group or without JackBeagle's is alright by me... first time in was after an event with other Yelp people and we needed some food after, got some hot wings and realized my math error shortly after they arrived: \"too hot\" is an understatement but it's bad form to waste food so I did the honorable, if uncomfortable, thing. oh well, if you play stupid games... Still, I was so impressed by the basic goodness of the wings that I had to come back. Didn't want a table and there was no room at the bar so I went out to the free-smoke patio. This time I let reason prevail and thoroughly enjoyed a wee bowl of stadium mac and a beverage: creamy, cheesey, macaronis tossed with sliced fried wiener and pretzel bits accompanied by a delicious red cider with jam in its name. Plenty of categories on the menu - burgers, dog, waffles... so I'll be back.",

The Mac n cheese is creamy and almost tastes like the kind mom would make .   The hubster enjoys the IPA's available as well.    The waffle fries are plentiful and while I'm not sure it tastes like they put Old Bay Cajun seasoning  on them - can you say yum    The only challenge is parking. There's limited street parking and DO NOT be tempted to park in the YMCA lot a block away as they will boot your car and it'll cost you $125 To resolve.    Holidays and special events making the parking a disaster but still worth the trouble for great food.",

It's a great neighborhood bar with one important distinction: the food is unique and delicious. The bar tenders and servers were very friendly and helpful. We got there early and had no trouble getting a table.   We got entirely too much food, but it was too good to stop. We got the Buried Treasure Fries, the Widow Maker Philly cheese steak, the Country Mac, and the Jack Mac. The mac and cheese was the star of the show. The Country Mac was our favorite, but both were delicious. The fries were awesome as well. The Philly was at the bottom of my list, but it was still very good. It just didn't stand out quite as much as everything else.   There was so much on the menu that I wanted to try, so I'll definitely be back for more. I think this place is flying under the radar for those that don't live in the area.",

They have healthier options (like salads and sides), but if you're looking for something that is hearty, hot, and tastes great, give this place a shot!  The food is perfect for carb-lovers and burger-fanatics and the mac and cheese has a lot of flavors to choose from. My favorite GO-TO meal is the loaded BBQ/Pulled pork waffle fries. I always have enough to share and even take home afterwards.  They have an outdoor bar which has a ceiling to protect against rain or cold weather, and even outdoor heaters. You can even bring your dog to the outdoor bar. It can get pretty noisy as they may have live music playing outside or over the speakers, this is NOT a quiet spot. (not good for headaches, but great for 'Hangry' people)  The service has been great every time I've been there, bar and table for both. It is definitely affordable for the quality and quantity of food they serve. The atmosphere is laid back and casual. I plan on coming back often!",

I noticed it was different from the last time I was there and that the prices have increased a good amount.. I go ahead and order my burger the double cheese burger with 3 x bacon and 2 x American cheese for $13... I asked if fries come included and waitress said no and that everything is a la carte (not a fan) I still ordered fries at $3.. so total is $16 for a double cheeseburger with fries.. where as most places fries or a side is included not too mention I asked about lettuce and tomato and was told that would be an additional charge as well and I asked the burger to be cooked Medium...   Then after placing the order the server then request for a card to start a tab but I'm not sitting at the bar and she couldn't explain to why she needed a card to put on file when I wasn't sitting at the bar..  Food comes out super quick which is good and as I'm looking at the burger her and I both notice that it's missing the 3x bacon so she takes it back and then they just slap the bacon on it. My burger was actually cooked well to well done instead of medium the fries were decent enough..  As we were wrapping up before even showing the bill the waitress asked if she should charge the card that I had handed her.. which rubbed me the wrong way, not sure if they have alot of people skip out on tabs or what to input some of these policies.   To each there own but I probably wouldn't go back mostly because of the policies they have there now.",

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Tenders, which came with waffle fries. My food arrived quickly. The buffalo tenders were delicious-- white meat, tender chicken ..melt in your mouth. The waffle fries are ok. For it to be later in the night, this food went above and beyond my expectations. I'll be back to try the mac and cheese and the nachos. Cool environment, awesome live music, and fun vibe.",

I went there for brunch on Sunday morning and the omelet I had was AMAZING! With every bite I could taste the cheese, peppers, onions, and bacon (I got the Western omelet with bacon instead of ham) so they did not skimp on the ingredients inside of the omelet at all which I find a lot of places do. The taters were well seasoned and cooked very well (not too mushy but not too hard either). I experienced great customer service and was more than pleased with the quality and quantity of food I received. I would highly recommend this place",

    "text": "Finally made my way here since we were on the hip side of town and were pretty much famished...  Luckily I don't have a problem talking to strangers because I knew where this place was supposed to be, but I saw no indication that it was actually there... If I hadn't asked the nice ID checking guy standing at the door, we'd have walked right past it... Can we at least get him a shirt that says JackBeagles? lol  I'm going to go ahead and put my cards on the table... If you put anything spicy in front of me, the battle is already half won... I love a nice, bold, spicy dish and that Jack Mac is the definition of delicious in my book... It's the perfect combination of cheesy, creamy and spicy... I will absolutely be back for that... The boyfriend got the Chili Mac and while it wasn't bad, the chili pretty much overpowered the mac... It was good chili, though...  We got two of the philly sandwiches... I got the regular one which was absolutely amazing... The bread was soft on the inside with a nice crust around, the fillings were nicely sliced and were packed inside great... I hate having to wrangle a messy sandwich... lol The boyfriend got the philly with the pepperonis and it was a hit with him... I liked it, too, even though he drowned it in mayonnaise... (Ick.)   You know, it was the kind of night where I ordered a beer and it was decent, but I honestly can't even remember the name of it... And I didn't write it down... Sorry about that, guys... lol  They do have a solid beer selection, though, so I'd give it a whirl...  There's a new patio out back, apparently, but this hungry girl didn't make it past the plate this time... Next time we head in, I'll update...",

I had the patty melt which was very flavorful, if a bit greasy, on Texas toast. It was served with a side of waffle fries. The fries have recently started some type of seasoning, which I can't place. It's neither good nor bad, it just is.   The chicken tenders are always a great choice. They have a light breading, and there are a variety of sauces. We tried leg jumper based in the reviews of other helpers. It was a spicy mango habanero. When it was too spicy, we asked for honey mustard. That was an additional 50 cents on the bill for a second sauce. Lame.   The patio is nice, and I recommend sitting out there.",

    "text": "So, I was looking forward to returning to Jack Beagle.  I told my husband how good the Turf and Turf Burger was and how that they will give you a portabello mushroom cap on the bun without the beef and bacon.  Well, he ordered it that way and ended up with three mushroom slices on a bun.  He was still hungry after he ate  it and ordered the blue Mac and cheese.  When I ordered the portabello burger with no meat, it came with a side, those delightful waffle fries.  My husband was shorted. However, I ordered the steak salad.  They had a vegetarian option that substituted portabello mushroom slices for steak.  I also subbed the garlic ranch dressing for the balsamic vinagrette.  With those fried onions and blue cheese crumbles, that had to be one of the best salads I ever had.  I have a feeling though that one portabello cap was shared between my salad and my husband's sandwich. So, if someone orders the portabello cap with no meat, please give them them the whole cap as the menu clearly states.  They want to have a satisfying meal, too.  Vegetarians don't live on air, and they don't like to be cheated.   Otherwise, our server was very nice.  And, if my salad wasn't so good,  the rating would have been lower.",

This is also an excellent place to go watch the game with your friends. They seem to always have some kind of live music whether it is an open mic night or an awesome local band like Swim in the Wild. This place can get pretty crazy on the weekends like any of the bars in NoDa but it is always a good time and never disappoints. They also have a pretty awesome selection of beer with usually at least one really nice craft beer on special for $2-$3. I highly recommend this place.",

The issue that I had was she was visibly disrespecting her staff for clearing tables and bathroom checks continuously; however, she stayed seated at a table texting on her personal cell phone while calling out orders. It even got to the point the cook brought her a bowl of food out., as he was waiting on her hand and foot. You could tell her staff was visibly upset by the way she was treating them, but didn't have the voice to be able to speak. As a customer,  I can use this platform and hopefully the owner/upper management  of Jack Beagles can get to the bottom of this serous management issue.",

The staff is always super friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and I always manage to meet interesting people here. The drinks are strong and the bar food is yummy. I definitely recommend the wings and the mac 'n cheese. They cook up the pasta, then add things in to toss around in a pan, and the final step is they put it into an oven so the cheese on top melts. If you sit at the bar, you're going to have to order it, because it'll be right in front of your face, calling you.   The funny thing is that everyone seems to have one item they say you have to try. I've heard so many now that I can't keep track. Go with your gut, your hungry growling gut. It can't go wrong here. Plus, the patio in the back is dog friendly and the music is always great.",

Consistently, they have some of the best bar food, burgers and mac & cheese I've ever tasted. However, we've been dining here since 12' and the service is always the worst part. I don't want to say what all I have witnessed from the FOH staff but it has been awful at times. I know it's NoDa and all but service is service..whether at a bar or white table cloth. Last night, our server Logan won us back over. As a server myself, I saw that this guy went over and beyond! He greeted us promptly, brought our dog a bucket of water, and was just a friendly guy who made us feel welcome and taken care of. Logan rocks!",

Sometimes it takes a minute to get noticed once you sit down but after that your in the clear. Best Mac and cheese ever! I honestly have never had a bad meal here! Perfect spot for a relaxing meal!",

A comfy, orange-and-brick space with beers both adventurous and non, a large, well built bar, good service and few TVs. Tuesdays are half price pints, lovely lovely. Low-key personality and it kinda works.",

    "text": "Great food, cheap price, great service. What more could you ask for? We stumbled upon this gem Friday night and despite a decent sized crowd, service was quick.  This place features greasy diner food, Northeast style. My friend and I had the rippers, deep fried hotdogs, and they were great, although I am sure that was my recommended calorie intake for the week.   We both had 2 rippers, fries (which were like really really thick potato chips and delicious), a beer each, and walked out with a $15.50 bill. With so many new restaurants charging more, it is nice to see this spot solidifying itself as the neighborhood hole in the wall.  There was no visible sign out front that I saw. I had to ask the waiter what the name of the place was, hopefully they will work on better branding with their menus/signs in the future. Also, the door guy has no personality and even though I went to the place twice in 1 night, he had no short term memory and kept IDing me. Otherwise, great experience, will definately be heading back in the future (after 5000 sit-ups to cancel out the first visit!)",

I'm not surprised however considering all of their staff look like they haven't bathed in months.

Arrived at 12:45 on a Sunday. Sat and waited... and waited... and waited. Finally. After getting a menu craving some brunch I ordered a beer and... waited. Food order finally taken at 1:15 only for the server to come back and tell us that they stop brunch at 1pm... Well then... Understandable that we were cutting it close but the service was ridiculous. Few tables on the patio and a few inside. Not busy by any means. However. The beer was delicious. Asked for a HOPPY ipa and was not disappointed (not sure what it was). After the long wait and no brunch settled up for the beer and headed to Cabo. Sad I really want to like this. Maybe down the road.",

I enlisted about five months later but I still go to this bar every single time I return home! I always get the same great service with the same great prices. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and nothing disappoints me.   I met one of the owners once and frankly, he looks like everyone else working there. Jack Beagles' is my favorite bar anywhere and I'll gladly continue supporting this place. Special shout out to Henry, Alex, the cooks, and the hilarious DJ who's name escapes me at the moment.

    "text": "Last night one of my roommates were in the area for Noda Crawl. After walking around for a bit we decided to stop for some dinner in Jackbeagles. After looking through Yelp earlier in the day, I read a lot of good reviews on the various Mac and Cheeses so I was enthusiastic to try it for myself.  Let me tell you, my bowl of their signature Jack Mac did NOT disappoint. It was everything promised in the description: a perfect balance of spicy and cheesy flavors. You can tell that the chefs at Jackbeagles put the time into making each bowl of mac and cheese in house (none of that throwing frozen noodles into the microwave business). It was the kind of food that left me feeling sad when I scooped up the last bite.  As far as the venue goes, it was a small space with limited indoor seating. There were tables outside but we were able to snag a table inside in the seat-yourself restaurant. The decor wasn't anything fancy or unique, but who needs it with Mac and cheese so good? Some servers seemed more enthusiastic than others but overall I had a great experience.",

I, wasn't hungry (surprised?) but my brother was so he got a meal and told me to order some appetizers.   We ordered the mac n cheese and the buried treasure which was covered in beef, cheese, on top of waffle fries. They were delicious. The mac n cheese wasn't bad but the only problem I had was it was a little on the salty side. Though, I didn't have a good beer to wash it down so that's probably why it's a little salty. If you have some alcohol with that I bet it would taste awesome.  The service. Not bad. When we went in there it was during late afternoon so it was sort of dead. But, that doesn't matter when the waiter was nice and offered her favorites on the menu that made our decision for what to get.   All in all, I would come here to drink and eat. But I want to emphasize, next time I'm definitely going to get a beer with my food.",

    "text": "After spending two nights in downtown Charlotte, we decided to see what this NoDa thing and JackBeagles were all about before we headed back to Raleigh.  (thanks to Yelp for letting us know about both). I will say that getting to NoDa was interesting, as our GPS led us first to a street that was totally closed off, then to one that made us wait for the longest slowest-moving train on the planet.  But it was all just a plot to make sure we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes for JackBeagles to open at precisely 11:30 on a Monday morning.  We weren't the only ones waiting, and within minutes of opening, 4 or 5 tables were full.  Server handled it all well.  Drinks came out fast.  Sadly, we were hitting the road, so we didn't partake in brew offerings.  Love that they have cup sizes of the different Mac n Cheeses, enabling me to try a couple of them...Jack Mac and Mexi Mac at just $2.99 each!  Husband did the Reading Street Steak Sandwich, which  involved mushrooms and tomato.    Note:  this isn't already-prepared Mac 'n Cheese...you can see them make it to order!  Both of mine were rich and delicious in an under-stated way.  I enjoy a cheesy Mac n Cheese, as compared to a baked kind, and that is what they deliver.  For the Jack Mac, think cheese with a Frank's Red Hot kinda subtle undertone.  Mexi-Mac had some green chiles of some type in a subtle way as well.  Liked them both equally well, and thanks to their richness, got to enjoy them again the next day.  Meanwhile Husband was liking his sandwich and fries. Although he did say he thought it could have used more seasoning.  No leftovers for him though, that's for sure.  Price-wise...very reasonable!  TIP:  Check-out the cute pic on the restroom door!",

I had a more traditional breakfast, whereas my spouse had a gigantic omelette that I helped her finish.  Value...4 stars.  For the amount of food given, this was an excellent value.  Ambience...3 stars.  This is a divey type of bar.  There was outside back seating, which we did not choose, so can't say how that was.  The most important thing was that it was clean enough.

Tons of food choices including a brunch menu on the weekends. Cheap beer and shots specials. And a solid chance you will catch some live music too. They have outdoor seating available year round and a second bar outside by the stage.   They don't have a huge area inside so during typical dinner hours there might a short wait to get a table. The folks who work in the kitchen really know what they are doing whether it's a fried hot dog, a huge burger, sandwiches or their famous Mac and Cheese.  Overall expect a solid calm neighborhood feel from this place. They have great specials throughout the week including 50 cent wings and a great invention called the Macarrito. Also plenty of local brews on tap. So go on our and enjoy yourself :)",

We were famished after all the moshing and head banging and needed food in our belly to soak up the overpriced alcohol and sober up a bit before heading back home (don't worry, we had a DD).  Each of my friends ordered the Philly cheesesteak. One even ordered it with cheese whiz (ugh... just... no). I, however, strayed from the pack and ordered a basket of fried mushrooms and a cup of chili mac. The fried mushrooms were thinly sliced portabellas, lightly breaded, and fried golden. While it was good, I'm not sure I would order it again. The chili mac was made with your typical elbow macaroni and cheddar cheese, but what elevated the dish was the savory, sweet, and slightly spicy chili.   There were no complaints from anyone in our group. We left with our bellies full and smiles on our faces.  I love the divey atmosphere of this little restaurant. The staff was very amiable, especially our server, Ryan. My opinion of this place may be skewed even more favorably since Ryan comped half my meal without me knowing. JackBeagles was a great ending to our amazing night. There's simply no wrong choice with anything on the menu so give this place a visit if you're in the NoDa area.",

    "text": "This is a good place to eat for a good price. Wednesday is half off wings and they are delicious! Try the barbalo sauce if you can't choose between buffalo and BBQ like me. The appetizer chicken tenders are juicy and the breeding is very tasty! Plus they come with French fries. You can't beat that.   The best thing on the menu is the Mac n cheese. You can't go wrong with any of them. I have noticed if you go during non rush hours (probably before 5pm) it's super cheesy. But honestly any time is good and they make it to order so you know you aren't getting 1-2hr old pre-made Mac n cheese. You might be thinking a bowl won't fill you up, but trust me. It will!!   They have pretty good beer specials and prices. The bar staff has always been good and most people at the bar are friendly.   Around 5 or 6pm they dim the light and the music gets a little louder so if you are looking for a more quiet environment come a little earlier. It's a good bet that they will have live music on the stage in the back and every time I've been there or walked by it been great! Good place, fun times. If your in Noda and need a place to eat for on the cheap stop here. Or if you have a craving for Mac n cheese don't even consider anywhere else!!",

I am very disappointed and I will never come back here. What a waste of money.",

Is there something in the air (no, not THAT something)?  Whatever it might be it's responsible for another great place in a great neighborhood.  I've been to Jack Beagle's twice now, both evening visits, and it was a great experience on each occasion.  Their beer list is distinct, and apparently ever evolving as the list on the menu was the same both times but what was on tap didn't necessarily match up, including beers like Abita Select (a vanilla porter) that I haven't seen anywhere else around town.  Along with the snooty stuff I like they keep a selection of the yellow fizzy stuff around to keep that crowd happy as well.  The menu...it's interesting, in a cool awesome way.  Great hot dogs are available any number of ways, including deep fried (not battered like a corn dog, just to dog boiled in oil basically).  And the potato wedge-fry things are the side to get.  Great tasting and they do get at soaking up the extra alcohol from the previously mentioned beer selection.  Head to NoDa and give Jack Beagle's a try, totally worth the trip!",

A mix of peoples, I found a seat immediately and ordered up a dogfishhead pint and gazed at the menu with a small excitement that only comes when I see piles and piles of options for everything. Where to start - the hot dogs which you can get cooked 4 different ways? The Treasure Fries that you can get no less than 8 toppings on?! THERE IS JUST SO MUCH COOL STUFF GOING ON HERE!!!!  The red lighting, exposed brick, small bar, open plan - I love the decor and vibe. The service is quick, friendly and unpretentious ~ and the food? Zing! While they weren't having a great fry night as told to me by the human frymeter that is Tonya, I went with 2 hot dogs and the pasta salad on the side. Hate on me if you will, but I looooove pasta salad and I think it's awesome that this place offers it! It was delish - mayo based with feta, tomatoes, dill and celery. Yum! As for my dogs, I had them smoked with jalepeno relish, chili, slaw and mustard. Boinngggg! I don't even like hot dogs, but these things made me smile big time.  Price wise, this place is ON POINT with my beers, dogs and side coming in at under $11 - I felt like I was ripping good ol' JB off! Will definitely be coming back a lot more now that I know the relaxed, yummy place that awaits across from the sweet NoDa firestation.",

Who would ever have thought that this NoDa bar would have gourmet style Macaroni and cheese???  Well thank goodness my friend who had indulged in a drunken binge of trying some random menu choices stumbled on this.  We tried the traditional and the bacon and blue cheese one....... Omg.  Really, the pasta is traditional elbow macaroni and comes served in these large ramekin bowls, which means they are made for individual servings! Which means you don't have to share!!!!  The cheese was so melty and gooey..... The flavors were spot on! A nice bar to hit, if you are looking for a patio spot, too (in the back).  I am shamed to say that the Mac and cheese is all I've had here.... When it's that good, do you need anything more? No.....",

(The Shit on a Shingle and an order of eggs with sausage) The inside was busy--but not slammed by any means, and we watched as couples sat down next to us and received their orders within 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes pass... Still no word. Then 30 minutes.... Our waitress comes up to us and says she \"doesn't know what happened\" but it \"shouldn't be more than a few minutes.\" Now we are going on 45 minutes, all of the surrounding tables/bar stools have eaten and already left and have been reseated. Our waitress comes up again and gives a pretty insincere apology, saying to us \"it should be coming soon, but I don't know if you want to wait any longer or just leave.\" Since we waited so long, we figured we would give it a few more minutes. Yet another 10 minutes passed... So, hungry and frustrated and without a sincere apology or explanation, we walked out. Not proud of walking out, but an hour of waiting is inexcusable. Guess customer service wasn't a priority this day.",

This is your classic neighborhood bar, but with a fantastic beer selection and great food.   I've only had two food menu items:  the hand-battered corn dog and the fries.  As many other reviewers have said, the fries are more like thick-cut chips and are the most delicious potato I've ever eaten.  I could eat a burlap sack full of them.  I there was a Groupon for \"burlap sack full of Jack Beagles fries\" I would buy it.    A sample menu of the beers I've had a JB:  Heavy Seas Siren Noire, New Holland Dragon's Milk, Abita Vanilla Porter and Oskar Blues GNIGHT.  Not shabby at all.  Pretty damn good, if you ask me.    The atmosphere here is nice and has an eclectic mix of people.  But, dammit!  I can't get away from Will Puckett's art in this neighborhood.
