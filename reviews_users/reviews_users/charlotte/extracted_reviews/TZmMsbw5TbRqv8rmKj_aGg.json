Maybe the parking sitch during the day when it's particularly hopping but that's so not their fault :)  This place is a deli w many vegetarian and vegan options, a watering hole w delicious beer, wine, and my fave -sake!- available to purchase and enjoy on site (hello, pregame?), a performance space showcasing local talent (DJs, live music inside the place and outside on the patio, female wrestling out back, noise show, etc), and the perfect location to buy White Elephant/Crazy Gift Exchange gifts (seriously, they've got loads of kitschy things).   Their grilled cheese and soup daily special is filling, yummy, and a steal at only $6. The selection of kombucha teas rival Healthy Home Market and Earth Fare. The music on Thurs & Fri nights always provide eargasms. The sake selection is expanding and I'd like to think it has a tiny bit to do w me turning all my fellow CM goers on to the bottles of nigori they carry.   In case you are wondering: No, I don't nor have I ever worked at CM and no, I'm not dating anyone that works there. I'm just a girl sitting in front of <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> asking it to love Common Market.",

My favorite times to go are weekend nights to sit/stand out on the front patio and have a few drinks or in the morning to grab a breakfast sandwich from the deli. The beer and wine selection here is great. Pick from the fridge or grab something on tap from the bar. Some nights they have bands play in pretty much any space they can find - inside by the bar, in the little alley, out front. Check out all the other little snacks and knick-knacks for sale. It's like a weirdo's Cracker Barrel in there and I love it.",

The place is usually packed, but it's a fun way to spend your evening   You can grab a six-pack of an obscure brew and drink it right there at one of the tables inside or on the (somewhat hidden) patio outside. On a nice day, the patio is a great place to sit and relax. But after a rainstorm, it can be pretty gross out there.   Common Market has a great selection of wine and beer, but it's often pricier than the Harris Teeter. For example, a bottle of Riesling might go for $10 there while it's $7 at the Teeter. But Common Market is open well past 10, when the Teeter and other shops close, so it's your best bet for late-night beer/wine runs.",

They have a lot of variety and snack foods for vegan/vegetarian folk, and the prices are very reasonable. I love that this place is like a little beer shop you can drink at, aka, they don't have jacked up prices on beer. They also have a great selection beer.  Also all the people who work here are very nice and friendly. I always feel welcome and enjoy the good vibes put out but the employees and most of the patrons. This is a great place to relax with some good food and drink, but not so much the ideal place for a date.",

Walking in is like entering a cave of wonders. The entire place if filled with all sorts of snack foods and sundries which are unique, interesting and fun.  The deli is another great feature of this gem which has many a unique and great tasting sammiches along with a variety of other packaged food that range from vegan dished I'd never dare touch to great individual salads.  Which brings to my favorite part of the place, being a beer nerd and all, the nearly unlimited selection of beers and wine. The Common Market boasts not only of a large selection of macro and micro brews but with a staff that truly enjoys and is knowledgeable of all things beer. Tom, Jason and the rest of the staff can not only pour you a perfect pint but give you all sorts of data and unique facts of whatever you're drinking. Wednesday nights' free tastings are great for those venturing out into the craft beer world as you can sample a variety of beers for free.  The CM has the feel of a backyard lounge where all your friends will eventually swing by or come to hang out. Everyone seems to know each other and the crowd is very varied and eclectic (I've always wanted to use that word).  Ultimately, the CM is a great place to hang out and relax as most anyone will find something for them there.",

    "text": "I want to love the Common Market SO much.  After all, it's a quirky little place, with a great selection of interesting beer, wine and grub.    The things I love:   1)  I love their selection of beer and wine.  I feel madly in love with a Belgian beer, and this is one of the few places in town I can buy it.  It helps that it is so close to where I live, too.  2)  I love that they have beer and wine tastings on occasion.  Nothing like trying new stuff!  3)  All the staff people working there are awesome and friendly.  They helped me find what I was looking for and even recommended some good beers to me.  What I don't love:  1) Their food is really bland.  I have tried two of their sandwiches and two of their soups.  Both times I was incredibly disappointed.  The soup tasted watered down and their sandwiches were flavorless and dry.  The first time we thought maybe it was just a bad day; after the second time, I think I just need to give up on their food.  2) The parking is not great.  Now that they have finished some of the construction on Commonwealth, you can actually use some of the street parking.  However, on a busy night, all these spots are taken and parking is still limited.  3) This place is always crowded.  The space is cramped in there, with really narrow aisles.  The crowds make it difficult to search through the shelves to find some great brews.  It also makes it difficult to order food when the space is small and crammed with people.  I am still never sure if I'm cutting in line in front of someone.  In sum, I love the staff and the great selection of beer and wine.  This is what will keep me coming back.  However, I think I'm going to pass on the food from now on.  Overall, I give it 2.5 stars.",

An awesome selection of beer that you can't find anywhere else, that was the first place I browsed. I drank the Aventinus which was absolutely delicious (and at 8.2% alc. content it got me where I wanted to be.) The only small problem I feel was that the seating was limited and parking was also limited. I think this only applies to the wintertime because it's too cold to go outside to drink.  I have heard raving reviews and talk about their deli, but sadly when I went there it was closed and I didn't get the chance to go and try their food. They definitely have an amazing amount of beer food where it accompanies your drink. I found that really useful as my friends and I did buy some snacks to eat. I will definitely be back here for their free beer sampling.",

    "text": "I dig the Common Market. Why? Because you can come in looking however you want and pick up beer, a sandwich, weirdo flavored chips, condoms, pimento cheese - whatever. Such a cool spot to hang with the dog or friends while drinking local brew outside. The juice is super rad - do that for sure! Also every sandwich they make is like love between bread slices, and the soup is outstanding. I love coming back to the office with the combo to share with work pals.   Open late, its a great place to start or end the night. That late night snack and on less beer before that Uber ride home - or a 6 pack pick up and sammie grab for the in house night cap and snack. I love the local vibe you get here. Random shopping sprees are the coolest here. I once left with a rubber chicken - don't ask and don't be jealous. It was a great night. Common Market = Charlotte must!",

When I was there is appeared to be an organic food store, a farmers market selling fresh vegetables and fresh fish, a beer bar, and a deli.  I was there for lunch so I had a black and white bean salad as a side and a tuna melt.  Anywhere that has a tuna melt is alright in my book, and this place was no different.  The sandwich was fresh and delicious.  The bean salad was awesome.  It was the two types of beans, and some onion, cilantro and lime.  I wish I could order it in bulk.    I was with my vegetarian sister and she enjoyed all of the vegetarian options.  We sat outside on the patio.  There are a bunch of long picnic tables with umbrellas giving it a German beer garden feel.    This place was so cool, and the neighbourhood was so cool I wanted to start looking for jobs in Charlotte.  Seriously.  If you get a chance, check this joint out.",

I wasnt sure what to expect when we walked in - It's a mixture of a bar, a deli, a craft beer shop and a knick-knack store. It's got a good sized patio that's perfect for kicking back and people watching (if you're in to that sort of thing). Blue Ribbon tall boys are priced cheap and the cans are ice cold. Overall the staff was friendly except for the bartender who was just too hip to actually give an answer a simple question. Make it a point to stop in - it grows on you more the longer you stay.",

    "text": "Why hello, common market, and look at your stellar craft beer selection!   I must say, common market is an amazing local staple. Half of the fun is educating yourself on the astute choices of brews to choose from. You just seem to feel like branching out and trying a micro/craft brew that you've never heard of before. Or, for the hipster at heart, grab a PBR and join the crowd. Their selection varies, so be sure to check back for seasonals and different locales to be featured/available.  I love the giant drums of beer and glass bottled coke throughout the shop as well. Makes it feel less like grocery-esque for a quick grab n' go.   The deli is a phenomenon. Friendly for the typical sandwich aficionado and the vegan/veggie types. The flavors and combinations are endless and the deft hands of the deli staff move the lines faster than other places.   Gotta love the niche humor and accessories/toys for sale. Always good for a gag gift or oddly celebrated white elephant party in July.   Something for everyone here. Grab a six pack to go, a draught with friends or snackage for the road.   Never a dull moment for this plaza midwood hearth. Always a pleasure to visit.",

Husband and I were driving around looking for someplace new to try...\"The Common Market has so many great reviews, let's do it.\"   The parking lot is small, but we found a place to park. I thought, \"Wow, this place is hopping already. Can't wait!\" However, once we entered everything came to a screeching halt. It's a weird combination of convenience store meets deli meets poor college student's rental home. There's stuff EVERYWHERE and it's completely overwhelming. The deli is on the side and there's a little bell to ring when you want to order...apparently there's cooler places to be and people to hang with when they're not serving up sandwiches and soup.   The atmosphere is not really chill and \"hippie-esce\" like I was anticipating. It was more edgy and raw, which was not appealing or inviting for my taste. The music was not laid-back, more like aggressive.  We grabbed a tea and headed out only to top it off with the cashier saying that they do not accept credit cards unless the sale was over $5. Grabbed some munchies to push us over the mark (one drink, one package of crackers for nearly $7 = robbery). Geez.   Plus side: They do have a huge variety of beers and wines. Seems like people get pretty comfortable.  Downside: Not for me.",

The front area used to look a little divey, but they redid it not too awful long ago.  Now they have a nice patio out front and its just more inviting in general.  When you walk in the door you immediately notice all the booze in the back.  But wait, there's more.  If you walk to your left you'll see an awesome deli that has limited hours, but they have premade food in the coolers whenever.  If you would have walked to your right, you would have seen some awesome selections of coffee as well as Kombuchas and other similar items.  I love visiting for all these things, but the booze it what normally draws me in.  As per the booze.  They have a great selection of wine and sake, even a better selection of beer.  Not only are the coolers full of all kinds of diverse beers, there is even beer on tap.  Not something you find at your average convenience store.  The taps rotate, so there is no reason to mention what was on last time i was there.  Like I said, you just need to check it out for yourself.  Bottom line. I can't really explain this place.

They specialize in hard to find beers, with a section for sour beers, IPAs, and seasonals. They have a small bar, where you can get a beer on tap, and drink it there, or out on their nice patio.  They also sell wine! They've got a wine expert on site to help you with your selections. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about their beers as well. Since I was an out-of-towner, they were able to steer me to the best local beers, made just down the street.  The store also sells weird knickknacks and strange toys, like pigeon masks, or red fuzzy fezes.   The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. They made the visit quite enjoyable.  In the back, they have a deli with a wide variety of sandwiches, and a vending machine that sells musical accessories, like drum sticks and guitar strings.  The place isn't exactly clean, but I get the feeling that they're going for a dive vibe, which is certainly working for this place.  The patio is nice and large, with outdoor heaters and plenty of seating. They allow you to bring your beer purchased inside out onto the patio and drink it right there. This is something I'm not accustomed to, but I really enjoyed the experience!  If you're looking for something good to drink, this is your place.",

During Food Truck Friday, I highly suggest grabbing your food and then hanging to CM, where you can find seating and beverages on tap and in the bottle.  Like an NYC Bodega, they offer random treats such as King of Pops popsicles, Vegan Cookies, and have a full deli in the back. Sometimes I wake up craving the deli's tuna salad. I'm not kidding...it's delicious. The bartenders are always friendly and passionate to talk beer with you. They offer a large array of bottle beers, and seasonal taps. It's a great place to people watch and grab a quick bite. You can bring your dog too, which is always a plus!  The only reason I didn't give the CM 5 stars is due to 1. lack of seating (when it get's busy, it's packed, and seating is a rare commodity) and 2. It is HOT inside in the summer. I feel for the cashiers and bartenders, as I lasted maybe 10 minutes inside and felt like my face had melted off.  Otherwise, check out the Southend or Plaza Midwood locations. They're awesome and both bring a neighborhoodly flavor to the place.",

We had looked for live music and found Remy St. Clair which sounded interesting so in we went.  The stage area is at the front of a long, narrow patio with some seating, but mostly standing room.  I sat on the end of the stage and didn't feel out of place at all (but that's just me).  Even though there were people smoking in the crowd, because there isn't a roof it wasn't bothersome.  The band played a fun and lively mix of everything including original material.    We purchased a bottle of wine (or two?) and the bartender was happy to provide glasses for us.

What a surpise....haven't been in the central area in a while...so it felt like a hidden gem..I ordered a tuna sandwich and had a beer while we waited. The beer & wine selection is wonderful...it ties in very well with the bar...Most places put mayo in their tuna...this place did not, and it was the best tuna sandwich I have ever had. Keep up the good work guys! I'm going back when the first opportunity presents itself! 5 stars!",

A concept Europeans haven t got yet:) The selection is as good as it gets. Something for everything. When I asked about ciders, then swung me around a corner. Also a wine lovers haven -- asked specifically to recommend wines from Napa/Sonoma region before heading out there, and the lady gave me tons of great recommendation (where I actually visited the wineries of!)

Along with some novelty items, you can also pick up some standards incase HT across the street is closed. Be sure to check out their outdoor patio area, too!

Interesting, and the beer and wine selection is the best possible within four miles of my house. When I come in here to buy beer(let me know if your experience is similar), I tend to spend 15-20 minutes in the beer aisle, eyes 10 inches from the glass. The salivation and incredible indecision have to make my alcoholism and beer snobbery apparent.  If you like beer and wine and live near this place it should be your go-to \"support a local business\" place to stock up for your grill out, fancy dinner party, or lonely binge.   On to the food, though. I don't like it. Maybe it's just not my style but ive eaten here three times and never enjoyed it. Take that with a grain of salt, my friends sing their praises to the high heavens of the deli.   In summation: buy beer here. Buy wine here. Imbibe in the unique atmosphere, with some unique music, then stroll over to snug harbor for a crowd so unique you won't even think you're still in Charlotte. Try the food, if you like it let me know, I want to find something I like to eat here!",

There is occasionally live music and other events on the patio and behind the store. But even when there's not the patio is still a great place to sit and socialize. The only downside to the patio is that it isn't that big and can get crowded and smokey. Inside there is a great atmosphere with an eclectic music selection and usually interesting people with whom you can talk. Inside there is also a deli area with sandwiches, soups and salads. The menu includes vegan options if that's your thing. There are also a lot of interesting trinkets you can buy.  The Common Market is a great place to sit with a group of friends, a special friend, or by yourself. There are areas that get very loud but there are a couple corners you can find that are quiet enough to read by yourself all the while enjoying tasty beverages and food. It's also in a great neighborhood where you can walk to a number of other fun places.",

After you've picked up your food/beer you have the option of leaving or enjoying it on their tiny tiny back patio. I always choose the latter as I enjoy socializing with my buddies and watching the super diverse crowd that is rolling through. (They're also watching us. An older lady told my friend and I that we were \"very pretty boys\"..thanks?)  Often they have live music that is also a treat.  The price is right.

It's a great deli and they always have something for the vegans.  My favorite part of CM is the alcohol selection, especially since you can drink on site.  They have a small bar area where you can get draft beer and the taps are always rotating.  There is also a large cooler filled with beers from all over the world.  It's wonderful to find a great beer without any prior knowledge of it's existence.  The wine selection is also good.  I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I've been given great recommendations any time I've asked the staff.  The best part of all of this is you can pay retail prices for your booze and drink it there.  It's nice they're usually bumping some good tunes too (at least for my taste in music).  Where else can you chill out at a place with a bottle of great wine for 10 bucks?  The people watching is just fabulous at this place too...hipsters, hippies, 9-5'ers, bums, babies, you name it.  Cheap drinking and great people watching.  Love it.  Oh forgot to mention they have free wine and beer tastings, live music on the patio, and it's also a convenience store......Remember, I said it was diverse!",

One guy kept reopening sandwiches he had already wrapped. And we weren't the only ones waiting that long. Just awful and unnecessary experience.",

Everyone comes here: young, old, rich, poor, every race, ethnicity, you name it. They make great sandwiches and have classic snacks and a massive beer, wine and cider selection.   They've recently expanded the interior to include a real bar with beers on tap and booths inside, which adds to the two already awesome outdoor areas (one which is like an alleyway and the other which is the front patio). It's a great way to eat lunch and hang out all day, drinking retail price beverages with a casual deli restaurant type atmosphere.   Also, they have the good chips. Like, the really good chips that will make you break any diet plan you're on, especially after a few mimosas (which they sell all the ingredients for) and a really good made-to-order sandwich from their deli.",

    "text": "If you are wondering where to go if you are in Plaza Midwood look no further. The Common Market is a staple for the area. They have a little bit of everything in there! The inside has so much going on. There is a place to order food, a huge section of it reminds me of a convince store. There are baked goods, candy bars, chips, gum, etc! Then in the back of the store there is a large selection of craft beers and wine that you can buy to go. They also have a bar area where you can order a beer on draft or have a nice glass of wine!   My boyfriend and I did the wine tasting one evening and it was fun! The man that facilitated our tasting was nice and friendly. He explained each wine in detail and you could tell that he is well versed in the subject of wine! It was refreshing.   One area of improvement would be the bathrooms. It is a hit or a miss if they are clean or not. There are only 2 bathrooms available, so the line can get quite long! The last time I went one bathroom had some gross stuff on the inside back part of the toilet and the other bathroom had such a strong smell of urine that I couldn't even go in there and that's saying a lot for me!! But like I said, you never know what they will be like because one time I went and they were fairly clean! Just prepare yourself!   Overall, if you live in Charlotte (or are visiting) and you are looking for a place to visit that is special in Charlotte you need to stop by!",

We gravitated to the bar and had a glass of their excellent house draft. The coolers are filled with beers and wines that you can purchase and drink out on the patio. What a wonderful idea, mega selection and save some money by buying a six pack and splitting it with your friends. Great coffee and breakfast options are on offer. This makes for a great hub for the neighborhood, I am very all in on this place.",

Stopped by Book Buyers first (also a 5-star review) so get some great, cheap reading material, then had to figure out a lunch plan.   I did my best Lance Armstrong impression (sans PEDs) over the the Common Market. I've come through here a few times to grab a beverage and once got a sandwich (but that was after a few beverages so I didn't appreciate it) so I decided to hit up the deli counter again. I got the \"Just Back From Brazil\", which was one of their daily specials. I'm very much a carnivore, but when I chose the Brazil the ingredients looked so good I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE IT DIDN'T HAVE MEAT! WHAT?!? Avocado, hummus, lettuce, a mango-sriracha sauce, red cabbage, green bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers, and sprouts in a lettuce wrap. **sigh**  Someone once described the Common Market atmosphere to me as \"steampunk\". Wouldn't fully agree with that, but it definitely has a different vibe. I showed up one afternoon straight from work (for corporate America) and caught more than enough stink-eye to last me for the week while wearing my shirt and tie. Who cares though?! It's an awesome place with all sorts of different people. Can't fault anyone for being themselves! I'd take all the stink-eye you can throw for some of their $3 pints on Thursdays.",

    "text": "I don't even know how to start to describe this place... Everyone I talked to said we had to go and check it out, especially if we liked beer and people watching. This place definitely fit the bill!  To begin, this place is a literal market. More of a bodega really. You walk in to a small snack shop. They have local cheeses and meats and jar items. And chips, and t-shirts, and cigarettes. If you turn right there is a deli in the next room. There's a cooler with premade sandwiches, salads, pastas, cheeses, etc. And they have vegetarian and vegan items aplenty in there. There is also a random vending machine for musicians with drum sticks and stringed instrument strings.   If you continue straight when you walk in past the bathrooms on the left and the register on the right, you'll come to a small 6 stool bar on your left with 15-20 beer taps and a lot of wine options. They also had canned and bottled beer. In fact you can peruse the extensive beer section at the back of the store and drink it thee if you'd like! There's also a few tables and chairs to sit at, but not a whole lot. You can also drink out on their front patio, that has heaters when it's cold.   This was just a very interesting place to spend an hour at on a Saturday night. But it was fun and the beer was delicious and the company friendly. I'd stop back in Everytime I'm in the area!",

    "text": "The Common Market has two locations: This one in Plaza Midwood and one in Dilworth. They both have a very similar vibe and about the same options. The basics: they have a huge craft beer selection, they have beer on tap, you can drink here, they have awesome deli style sandwiches, the atmosphere is uber hipster.   I came into this location on a rainy day and parked over by Whiskey Warehouse. I came up through the back patio area and tried to order food at the bar. This is a little confusing, but you have to go around to the front, where the deli is, to order food. I asked for some recommendations and the girl at the deli suggested the \"Old Scratch\" on sourdough. The food came out fast and was affordable. I then grabbed a drink on tap at the bar and made my way out to the covered patio in the back.   The sandwich was awesome! They use fresh bread daily made by Golden Grains and this shows. The bread is so fresh and delicious. I'm not even a huge carb guy, but I would just eat a loaf of that sour dough. They also use all Boar's Head meats and cheeses. They have a ton of options as far as sandwiches go.   The outdoor patio, where I sat is a nice change of scenery and it is covered, so you can sit out there when it is raining. They also have seating inside and bar seating as well. This place is just the definition of hipster. I'm not saying that as a bad thing, but it's just the truth. It is so eclectic and just kind of off the wall.   The Common Market is a quick place to grab lunch or a drink. You will be in and out in no time, or you could sit and stay awhile. There are plenty of beers to keep you busy. I will definitely go back to try some more of that awesome bread!",

When I took it back to the point to sell the gentleman there let me know that it wasn't pork and was not helpful at all. I went and sat back down and thought about it And brought the plate back about 10 minutes later at that point the chef came out of the back  and proceeded to let me know that everyone loves his food and he'll paid money out of his own pocket to be done with me. He snatch the plate out of my hand walked to the back where I could see him and started to bang the plate as hard as he could against the trash.  As a food business owner and a person I would never treat any of my customers like this . I called the chef back over to the point of sale to let him know that I didn't appreciate my treatment and his reaction was uncalled for. The people that were at the common market were very nice and I love the idea of sitting outside however I would never go back there again",

I understand that this place has a policy that only allows one person in the bathroom at a time, but yelling \"she can use the bathroom by herself, that's why it's called handicap accessible\" was rude, ignorant, and off-putting.  3 stars because of the uniqueness and atmosphere, but I was not impressed with the staff.",

The horseradish cream cheese really made it. Would be great on a bagel. Other than that it was just a pretty typical roast beef sandwich. Took home a firehouse for my boyfriend. Was also just a pretty typical sandwich. They have beer on tap as well as a huge bottle selection and lots of other snack stuff and a deli case with salads and sides.

That could be due to the odd group of both hipsters and homeless people who hang out and smoke hand rolled cigs in the parking lot, but that kinda gives the place a little character. Then, you walk into a seedy corner store setup that you feel like you may get a bag herion with your food if you order the wrong thing off the menu. That aside the food is just kinda average but I think they're going for that. Again, probably not the worst out there but really overrated and I prefer to spend my money at places that value customer service. The staff is just kind of rude but I was wearing my CC hat and that may have triggered them.",

I wanted a local beer and they pointed me in the right direction (it was soo good), and broke down a six pack for my single brew.  Just...great.  Wish I had this place down the street from my house.",

They have a great selection of wine and beer (in single bottles as well as six-packs) and a deli with some fun sandwich/wrap combinations.    Also, there's a fun outdoor space in the back that is perfect for a relaxing lunch or, even better, day drinking.",

It's ok, it has a better than decent beer and wine selection but the deli falls flat. Boars head is not deli meat, or at least not deli meat to be proud of. I mean its fine for a grocery store, but it's not  crap your pants good.  I recently ran to over there hoping to get a loaf of bread to bring home for a dip we made and they only had pre sliced bread, it was a let down.     I also find the staff a little snobby for the product that they carry, but what can you do.  It is great as a wine/beer store, crappy as a deli, so thats why it lands at a three.    For what its worth, my wife is obviously a little meaner than me and said she has a hard time giving it anything higher than a two.  She might be right.",

    "text": "A few years ago, I wrote an article for the Charlotte Observer about where to take family and friends visiting from out of town and high on my list was the Common Market.    It's a cool little neighborhood place filled to the brim with lovely beers, wines, juices and sodas, as well as sandwiches & food (from their own deli), interesting munchies and a bevy of novelty candies, toys and merch.  I love the patio - it's gone through some major changes since the beginning, some of which has made it more difficult to hang out back there, but I dig it nonetheless.  It can be a little dirty sometimes, but that comes with the territory when you have many people coming and going all day... even though I think the customers should clean up after themselves out of respect for who might be sitting there next....  Keeping me from giving the full five-star treatment is something that is not really the CM's fault.  Sometimes I don't really want to go there because of how crowded and noisy the place can be with people wearing fake glasses and tight jeans.  I never know when the right time to go is.  You might think its safe to go on a Monday night, and you get there and find it's so damn crowded that you can't continue with your mellow hangout plans.  C'est la vie!   But still, I love the Common Market!",

I enjoy their barbeque tofu, and they've got some fantastic sandwiches. The whole she-bang will usually run you around $7, which is expensive when you think you could get the same deal from Subway for significantly less...but you feel better in your soul when you eat local!   Common Market is near Yoga One, which is where I get my downward dog on, so I find myself over there a lot. The staff is friendly, the wine and beer selection is top-knotch, and the food is good.  Another of my favorite parts of this shop is their little weird toy section. I have a stretchy, squishy, sticky red pig that I keep in my kitchen window that came from there, and also a set of unicorn action figures emblazoned with the Russian hammer and sickle vs. one with the US flag pattern. Where do they find this stuff?",

Way back in the day when Blake and Cress first realized the dream we jumped on board and have been enjoying the ride and the experience ever since!!!  Whether it's dropping in for morning coffee, breakfast/lunch/brunch from the deli or beers beers beers... this place has become the heart and soul of our neighborhood.  It embodies the best of what MorComm and Midwood have to offer... the crowd is the most eclectic thing you can imagine, from Izods and sperrys to skinny jeans, nose rings, full tattoo sleeves and mohawks you will see it all here.  People arrive by Range Rover, blown out Honda, Fixie bike, skateboard, or just cruise in on foot and fall in together and enjoy the scene.  The food is great... breakfast picks in our house are the \"later hater\" on everything bagel grill pressed and pimento cheese grits (yes you read that right), and lunch is a \"Jack Kennedy\" (egg salad and horseradish spread with bacon) on marble rye.  If you are into beer, then just go over and settle in and drink your way through the cooler... you will not be disappointed!",

Your typical lunch counter staples, like reuben on rye, clubs, and paninis, but with fancier breads, meats, and cheeses.

Plus, its only a $1 if you bring your own mug!  The beverage selection is out of this world!  Many foreign brands with many, many syllables.    Common Market is also loaded with hipster trinkets;  like dress-up Jesus magnets, cooler and more socially conscious-than-thou bumper stickers, and \"papers\"...he he.

I have fond memories of my visits to the Common Market over the years. March of '05 was my first visit. There, I purchased my first bottle of Pom and my first bottle of wine. On that same day, I learned that filling an empty Pom bottle with red wine makes for a perfect disguise. Since then, I always make it a point to rally some friends together and head here to drink in their quaint courtyard. Not only is the beer and wine selection incredible, and not only do they provide glasses for you to immediately begin drinking, they also have an fantastic community board that can help guide an outsider to the best nightlife in the city.",

Tommy does an excellent job of bringing in interesting microbrews from around the world for everyone to try.  The Common Market routinely gets beers before anyone else in the Charlotte area.  The selection is hard to beat and is always changing.  The staff are wonderful and attentive and know their beers!  And yes, there are hipsters galore, but when there's good beer, who cares?",

My wife and I love their food. They make my favorite pimento cheese sandwiches in the world(as I have said in other reviews, I am a southern boy through and through).  The pimento cheese deluxe is a work of beauty and taste like falling in love. My wife loves the ranchero burrito. If you are a coffee drinker, my wife loves their iced coffee. Whether you are just going for chips and a soda or you want lunch or dinner, this is the place to go. I also like that people from all walks of life, ethnic backgrounds, and interests shop here, which is great. Now due to the variety, some times it may not be the most kid friendly place to eat, but even at those times, you can get your food to go.  Whether you are suit and tie  person or a tattoos and cutoffs type a person this is your market. Oh and P.S. I also love the pimento cheese grits.",

Ive heard it described as the local country store where you can purchase a fried fish sandwich the likes of which you will never find again.   In the case of Common Market, local seafood is repliced with a wide selection of New York Style Deli options. Unlike other local delis, Common infuses vegan, gluten free and organic options to the menu.  It gives you a small town feel in the midst of one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. The old style fish and tackle store without the hooks and cane. The real deal in Charlotte.  People hold on to the establishment as a local icon. The Deli options are inventive and there is a wall of odities that would remind Xenials of Spencers, but kid friendly. The patio is dog friendly and parking continues to be accesable despite the unique location in the heart of Plaza Midwood.   Roco used to be my favorite Columbian styled, purveyors of incredible Carribean sauces. It still is but Common Market has it all. Almond milk to vegan cookies form part of the multilayered inventory of this one of a kind, hybrid market deli.   The staff is brilliant and always attentive. The enviorment is dynamic and diverse. Moreover, the arts and local artist are supported by the neighborhood.",

Walked in and was greeted by good vibes and hipsters. Always a good sign for vegan!!   Went straight to the ordering counter and ordered the vegan special which was soysage, daiya cheddar, veganaise, spinach, tomato and hashbrowns on a spinach wrap and drumroll.....VEGAN GRITS!  After I placed my order, I began perusing the shop while waiting for my order. I opted to pick up some lunch options from the cold case. I selected the garlic sesame noodles and vegan chicken salad.  Then I took a lap around the store side. Some great options including fresh coffee  and pastries.   While perusing the drink cases I came across my favorite San Pelligrino pomegranate aranciata. SCORE!!!!   Everything I purchased was just over $15!  When I got my order I ran to the car to photograph and partake since the little seating they had was occupied.  OMG it was the most delicious breakfast I've had as a vegan thus far!! The wrap was perfectly crispy from the panini press. The cheese and the veganaise gave a perfect creaminess--a texture I often miss as a vegan. The grits had the most perfect consistency and didn't need anything added. As a former cheese grits addict, it was unbelievable.   And what better than my aranciata to wash it all down!  Breakfast of champions!  The garlic sesame noodles were absolutely amazing and I enjoyed the mock chicken salad as well, though I typically like mine with a little bit firmer of a texture.But the flavor was spot on!  So happy I made it here finally! This will be my go to place for vegan breakfast going forward. Now just to find  sit down vegan breakfast and vegan brunch!!",

The back patio is supposed to be smoke free, but people sneak I think.  I prefer the back to the front, however.

I imagine the average Common Market customer to be a colorfully tattooed musician wearing sneakers custom designed by their equally cool artist significant other. In other words, this place seems like the perfect haven for creative, free-spirited Charlotteans who appreciate kombucha, beer and free love.  If a dive bar, a delicatessen, a New York-style upscale boutique grocery, and a punk rock music venue had a baby, they would name it The Common Market. There are lots of random things for sale on its shelves, like flotation devices, board games, and obscure candy. There is a little bar in the back, offering draft beer, draft kombucha, and $5 mimosas (at least when I was there on Saturday morning!). You can order food to pick-up at the courter to-go, or eat it on a stool or in one of their two quirky booths. I have only been for breakfast and unfortunately, have not had the best experience with food. I had soysage which was completely inedible (but props for offering vegan options!). I have had several people say that dinner is exceptional.  People watching is the best part of hanging out at The Common Market, and there is always someone interesting with whom to have a chat. It's so thrilling to experience some True local flavor in Charlotte--and there is live music at The Common Market almost every night! Drop by sometime and make The Common Market one of your CLT hangouts; I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "A staple of the Plaza Midwood community. Ask around where to get a cheap beer. The answer will be CM. Ask around where to get a craft beer. The answer will be CM. Where to try a nice wine flight. The answer once again CM. Common Market is not fancy but they will surprise you with their many options.   Food is another bonus. You can get a healthy lunch no issue here and it will be very tasty. They've got snacks if you don't have time and don't forget the beer/wine to go if you are having a little get together at a house.   CM is unique. It can be dirty but that's expected at a dive like this. The bathrooms show tons of character. They don't please everyone but that's the way it goes most time. Expect large crowds in the night times and realize they will be hipster and they will be weird. This place puts Charlotte on the map and whether it's day or night you should give it a shot.",

Last time I ordered a turkey panini from the deli and added pimento cheese and pickles. It was amazing! The staff is super friendly. I was a bit nervous as I wasn't dressed in a grandpa sweater and only have two piercings but both the deli guys and the girl at the register were very nice. I saw people on the porch who had bought juices and champagne and were making their own mimosas. Thought this was a great idea. Parking was available when we were there.",

The variety of clientele never fails to fascinate.   I've had a number of different things from CM: -Vegan breakfast with tempeh bacon and grits - pretty good. I'm just not one for savoury breakfast and not a huge grits fan. Others who like those things will definitely dig this. -Vegan burrito - hot dang this was delicious. It was a lunch special and it was just delectable.  -Veggie sandwich - hard to do wrong! Yummy and refreshing. -Chocolate-covered animal crackers - these things are ADDICTIVE. I was going in weekly to get a bag and had to stop because I ate too many. But now...I think the time is nigh.  -Snickerdoodle-flavored coffee beans - definitely a weirder choice but it was quite good.   I'm not a huge beer person but I recognize that their selection is extensive. I appreciate that you can come here at any hour of the day and there will be lots of people around and there is always food available. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks. They do it all! And they truly embody the Plaza Midwood spirit. Keep it up, y'all.",

This place is so many things to the neighborhood.  It is in the perfect spot, right off a central Ave on a part of commonwealth that actually doesn't see insane traffic.    The deli sandwiches are what made me fall in love with the Common Market.  All my other praises of the place may just be my food buzz that I get from the deli.  They have the best pimento cheese sandwich in the city.  All of their breads are fantastic and their veggies always taste very fresh.  Their breakfast is also out of this world.  Grab a bagel sandwich and a coffee and you have one killer breakfast for less than 7 bucks.  They are open until midnight in school nights, sell single cigarettes, have beer on tap and bottled in cooler displays, and the best deli food in the neighborhood.  What more could you ask for?  If you live, work, or play in Plaza Midwood, the common market is a requirement!",

    "text": "OK, the CM is a market, not a bar and not really a restaurant. Yes, they have a deli and yes you can eat on their patio and yes, it is good deli food as far as deli goes leaning toward hippie-ish.   So why is this place really cool? Well, they have one of the best beer selections in Chlt and you can buy a beer from the cooler and then go to the patio and drink it OR take it home. Can't do that in a regular bar but now the best part. You can drop off the face of the earth (as long as you don't tell everybody your secret hideout) when you go into their patio. It's a tiny courtyard that you only get to thru the store. No one can see in or out. You are surrounded by 4 brick walls with sky above. This is the perfect rendezvous place. Did I mention they have a great wine selection?    If you're looking for a place to meet incognito and have a great beer or bottle of wine, CM is the place. And it's close to so many other great places too boot.",

Please, please, please, PLEASE try the tuna (unless you're vegetarian).  It's a \"super secret\" recipe, and it's super delicious and addictive.  There's something about it that sets it apart from any tuna sandwich I've ever had.  (I happen to know the secret, thanks to a friend who is a former employee of the deli over at SouthEnd, but I ain't tellin'!)  Try it for yourself and see if you can figure it out!  The grilled cheese (with your choice of bread and TWO CHEESES!!!) is also amazing, and perfect for those mornings when you maybe had a little bit too much to drink the night before and need to soak up the alcohol residue with buttery, grilled bread and rich, gooey cheese.    There are also tons of other sandwiches, and options for creating your own.  Omnivore or herbivore can find their pleasure here.    No matter where I live or move to, Common Market will always hold a very special place in my heart.  It's a delicious deli, eclectic convenience stop, pleasant hang-out spot, and beloved Home Base forever.",

    "text": "Gold mine!  I visited this place recently with my brother.  After a long afternoon of outdoor labor, I was more than excited to hear that we were going to purchase a couple of cold ones to unwind.   When we pulled up to this place, I thought to myself \"Where in the hell has he brought me?\" I definitely learned that you cannot judge a book by its cover after visiting this place.  We made our way to the back of the store near the beer display case where my brother began to strike up a conversation with a man whom he knows simply as \"the beer man\". I don't know if I would ever want to be affectionately known as the beer man myself, but this man has definitely earned the moniker in my eyes.  Glancing at the beer display, I quickly realized that I was familiar with less than 20% of the beer selections and had actually only had about 10%.  Thats where the beer man comes in.  I think he could sense the hesitation in me with regards to my search, so he came over and began to give us a ten minute spiel on the different kinds of beers that he stocks, what they taste like, what they are made from, where they are brewed, etc. We went with his recommendation and were very satisfied with our purchase.  It is interesting to see the very different blend of people that frequent this place. I even saw a guy there that was dressed like Prince from the Purple Rain movie.  If you are looking to sit back and drink a good beer rather than the traditional busch or miller product, I would highly recommend making your way to the Common Market for a wide range of quality beer selections.  Oh yeah, they have other stuff too.",

So, grab a beer and head outside to the back porch and paint on the benches or bring a laptop to write.    It is a communal atmosphere with friendly guests who respect the joint.  It's easy to get lost in the view of urban decay with an Irish sized beer mug in hand, and the music is anything from Radiohead to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.  Drop on in and drop out!",

Hailing, most recently, from Chicago and, before that, Savannah, GA, I've experienced some awesome healthy-minded grocery stores. CM was right on par with some of my favorite markets elsewhere.   The food was great. I ordered the club sandwich, which was not only made awesome, but was also reasonably priced.   The shop itself, as previously stated, reminded me a lot of some of my other favorite markets of the same genre. And, being that I'm not quite the fan of Charlotte yet, it was nice to experience a place, in the city, that brought me back.  As for the staff, they were quick, friendly, and efficient. My only complaint was that I had to ask for a bag at the counter, to carry my lunch out.  Overall, I'd say CM is a place I'm glad I found in Charlotte. Personally, it brings back some good memories of places I've loved, and they have great sandwiches.   Fin.",

Located in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, this was one of Charlotte's earliest neighborhoods, which dates back to 1903, when its first avenues were plotted.  Plaza Midwood, as the area is known, is now home to the hipster crowd, with several blocks of turn of the century buildings offering MidCentry Modern furnishings, clothing and other brick a brack.   The Common Market offers many alternative lunching options from the usual fried choices of The South, including a vegan sandwiches, wraps and salad selections in the deli as well as colorfully named sandwiches that include meat such as the \"Simple Simon\", \"Billy Club\" and \"Evil Homer\". Alternatives to high fructose corn syrup laden soft drinks include brands made with - real sugar, a novelty in this day of cutting corners and expanding waistlines.   The clientele, on my visit, ranged from the hipster tattooed crowd to  locals buying a sandwiches. The Common Market is a cool little store, any city would be lucky to have an outpost of this market.",

A sandwich counter that not only allows for some insane customization, but delivers.   For the first day, I ordered the special of the day \"blue baron\". Even with all the  extra elements, it's still refreshing. The turkey is the pianist of this concerto, with everything else backing him up. Light, refreshing, with that distinct game taste still shining through. The habanero pico is not at all spicy, but offers a floral zestiness and acidity to the meal. They don't use thick cut bacon, but they pile on the thin stuff, and make it extra crispy, for that much needed texture. The blue cheese is not overbearing, but like a pale moonlight over nightfall. The focaccia was not as dense as I would have expected, but still had this buttery delicateness that fully suited the turkey. At no point was this dry. What seems like a heavy sandwich felt peaceful and light as a canoe on the lake.  The next day, i came ten minutes before breakfast closed for the Later Hater. Good god was that an amazing sandwich!! Maybe one of the best breakfast sandwiches Ive had in a long time. Every bite was packed with each ingredient, never stopping on this flavor train. They igve you a hefty amount of eggs to curb any appetite. The sausage was porky and well-seasoned. The vegetables were super fresh.  Although another bread besides croissants would have held this together better, the flaky, buttery croissant made it taste even better! Seriously, if you have to order one item, try to get this.   Although the firehouse hoagie sits underneath the amazingness of Sandwich Max's hoagies, they still deliver an awesome hoagie sandwich. Thick slabs of mozzarella, sharp salami, and fresh vegetables all in a soft yet chewy hoagie roll. This will hit the spot if you are in the mood for a big hoagie.",

The market has lots of neat little things too - beer, wine, chips, etc. There is even a bar inside.  The outdoor patio is great for sitting with your pup.  I will say that at night things get a little odd there so be prepared. It becomes a SCENE for sure.",

    "text": "Story time: the city, Charlotte. The time, 7 AM. A haggard young(ish) black man stumbles and bumbles his way out of the Iron Tribe gym. His arms are inanimate, save for the very many muscle cramps ravaging his triceps and forearms. His jacket hangs tenuously from a single arm, the last of his resolve having escaped him as his valiant attempt to don said jacket ended as his entire left flank contracted simultaneously. He looks towards his car: the is no way he's driving in this state.  His only hope is to stumble into the common market in hopes to eat some recovery food.   A woman stands behind the cash register. As she accepts the credit card of nondescript yupster (a hipster yuppie) #14, in the corner of her eye she notices a man with awesome hair drag his ailing carcass through the door, collapsing into the first empty chair he comes across. He clearly has no use of his arms, as his jacket isn't actually on. Well, he's managed to get one arm in. She asks if he needs anything, too which he responds \"water and bananas\". Common Market doesn't carry bananas, so, she grabs the next best thing: a Quest protein cookie and brings it to the man, followed shortly by the finest of free waters. She then brings the man a 2nd Quest protein cookie (gratis! For both) and a menu. Man cannot recover from exercise on Quest protein cookie alone, after all.   As the man sits convalescing, he orders an egg and vegetable wrap, and a water from the water case (CM Commonwealth has all the good beverage and beer/wine selections you expect from CM, AND a full sized bar with taps like the plaza midwood og!). After what felt like 3 weeks, his arms return enough to lift the wrap and taste the delicious healthiness of eggs and vegan cheese, spirits and avocado.   The lady rings the man up after checking on him once last time. They bid each other adieu.  The man, refreshed to the point of actual human function, vows to give them a good review on Yelp.",

I've tried a few on the menu and they are great. They always have some great specials, so don't forget to check out the board in the right when you walk in to order!  There is also a great variety of chips, drinks and alcohol. If you want to sit and have a beer, they have a few in tap or you can buy a bottle/can and hang out on the patio. One of my favorite things are the ziplock bags of goldfish, Cheez-its and trail mix they have by the cash register. Best impulse item ever.   Don't let the casual, scruffy decor fool you. The Common Market is an excellent place to grab breakfast or lunch. They get busy during the week, so try to go early or after 1pm to avoid the weekday lunchtime rush!",

Before the Midhood's STD bubble popped, and before they did whatever the hell weird thing they did with the front and back lots, and before there was a second location (is there a third now too?), this CM was a thriving, hip little pocket of quirky youts, of which there were definitely more than two.  There was a certain smell in the air, like cardboard, alfalfa sprouts, tobacco, patchouli, pizza, stale beer, paint and dreadlocks.   There was a fairly large crew of us who would arrive right at opening, and stay until close.  Those with jobs would leave only when we absolutely had to.  We would scrap together money, buy each other beers, sandwiches, cigarettes, drugs, give each other rides, trade shirts, draw on each other, talk shit, read books, play chess, dance battle, and play ad infinitum games of \"Would You Rather\" in an endless loop involving whomever happened to walk out onto the patio next.  This was some magical, magical shit.  We were Common Market Orphans.  Their deli is amazing, as is the drink selection.  Super top notch.  On top of that, the place is filled with weird little oddball gifts, toys, necessities and hodge podge.   In many ways the CM is like a casino - it is a self-contained world that enables and encourages you to stay as long as possible while losing a grip on your linear sense of time and space.  If that sounds woowoo, it's because it absolutely is.  Dave's not here man.  The last time I came here the vibe had completely changed.  I no longer felt like it resonated with me.  That's okay.  I had my time.  I'm sooooo glad this place existed for me as it did, and that it continues to have success as a business.  I have so much respect for this particular vision and this particular spot.    WYR forever. Cameron will always have good hygiene, and Consuela Voodoo will always be Portuguese for love.",

They have a deli with great food as well as some great grab and go options, many from local vendors. I love grabbing the Pasta & Provisions offerings in the freezer to whip up quick dinner at home. They have any and every type of beer/wine known to man. Random chips, candy you name it. Aside from being a market, it is also the place to drink and chill.

This location, nestled into Plaza Midwood, accentuates this fact with crazy things hanging on the wall, live music on occasion and a broad variety of beverages (ranging from off-brand cane sugar sodas like Boylan to PBR to tasty Belgians and beer snob can appreciate.  There isn't as much sitting room inside at this location as the Dilworth location, but its still a nice hangout.",

    "text": "Not being a native of Charlotte I was kind of perplexed when my friend asked if I wanted to go to Common Market at around 10pm for a Friday night out. I suppose I was thinking what's so fun about going to a grocery/deli at night? Well I was in for a surprise when I got there. The place is packed and parking was almost impossible, and it didn't help that people parked extremely close to me after I arrived making backing out of my parking spot a very tedious job.  Once inside you're greeted by music, friendly people and a huge selection of drinks. They have tons of beers here and it seems like a great hang out spot. However I'm allergic to beer so it wasn't really an option for me and since they don't really have much else to offer in the evenings I felt a bit out of place when I was pretty much the only person who didn't buy a beer.  The location is great during cool/warm weather since it is close to a lot of other attractions of the Plaza Midwood area though. A variety of bars such as Snug Harbor, and Petra's along with restaurants such as the Diamond are in walking distance of where you park!  Not really my type of scene but the sandwiches sound extremely delicious here so I'll have to stop by for lunch to try them out sometime.",

    "text": "The original Common Market in Plaza-Midwood is, simply put, a landmark location in my life. When I first moved to Charlotte, I didn't have a clue what to do or where to hang out. My first visit to Plaza-Midwood (on Record Store Day 2009) involved a trip to Lunchbox and then to the old Penguin. Afterwards, I didn't have a clue what to do and I stumbled across the street into the Common Market. I didn't have a clue what it was. It went something like this.  Wow, this is really interesting. A deli? Ice cream and snacks? Oh, sweet, there's a bunch of coolers in the back. Wait - craft beers? I had a place like this back at Virginia Tech. I'll grab something for home. He just asked me if I wanted it opened? Uhm... I don't get it. Hold on. Those guys are drinking. Now I'm drinking. So it's like a self-serve bar? There's food? Snacks? What's on this patio? Oh nice, more people. There's music here tonight? Sweet. If I had an assistant, I'd tell her to cancel all my appointments. I'm going to be here a while.  Simply put, Common Market is the hangout for all the crazy hipsters and young adults that are refusing to grow up and work in a cube. But the interesting thing is, just like the (old) Penguin, those people are here too - and we all just get along. I made my first friends in Charlotte here after nine fruitless months going to Meetup events and stumbling around at Evening Muse and other NoDa hangouts. Common Market was exactly what I was looking for - great people drinking great beer in a great place.  Since then, I've been to CM (probably) dozens or hundreds of times - it's not just a store or bar to visit, it's a central part of my routine. I have formed friendships with the staff there. Brad, especially; he's my beer guide and has taken the time to remember my name and what kind of stuff I like and he's shown me a few choice bottles that I wouldn't have looked at otherwise. CM's one of the reasons I moved to Plaza-Midwood. It's also one of the reasons I stayed when offered by my work to relocate to Phoenix. It's where I go when I don't know what else to do. It's where me and my friends have probably our best memories or started our most exciting nights.  Common Market is, simply, part of our lives.",

    "text": "Reviewing Common Market on Yelp seems almost like a right of passage. Will I be the first yelper to extoll the virtues of this deli/convenience store/bar? By no means, but do I honestly value this local gem? You bet your bottom dollar! Common Market's strength is that it can be many things depending on what you need.   Hungry for a meal? Go into the deli and you can choose from one of their concoctions (I recommend the reuben on rye, no mustard) or make up one of your own. Vegetarian? They have plenty of options for you as well (The mid-eastern wrap is particularly tasty).   Just looking for a snack to quell the (possibly late night) munchies? They have all kinds of tasty chips, pretzels, cookies and soft drinks to satisfy.  Oh, you wanted a slightly stronger drink? Well you are sure in the right place. Chilled, room temp, individual, 6-packed, in a case or on tap, Common Market has a beer selection to astound. Whether it's a PBR night or you are looking for your favorite craft brew they are prepared. I should mention they also sell wine, but with so many unique beers I tend to forget.  Did you want more of a destination than a grab and go? No problem. They've got tables inside and out on their patio. They have weekly live music performances. Or you could just pick up a copy of the paper and do the crossword.  Worried about parking? They have spaces in the front, a lot in the back, there is street parking and a large lot around the corner. Oh, and they have bike racks out back.  Do be advised that they have a $5 credit/debit minimum, so have cash if you are just grabbing a snack or drink.",

Kind of a strange place with a deli, convenience store, beer/wine store, and a small bar/eating area. They had a few good beers on tap, and a ton of good bottled beer as well.   That being said, the place seems a little disorganized, and there is not much in the way of seating. I had a question or two about some of the beers, and the employee that I talked to seemed to be annoyed that I had the nerve to bother him. Really the only thing that the place had going for it was the beer selection, and I would rather stick with Brawleys, especially given the difference in the level of service between the two...",

Their specialty however is the amazing sandwiches of unique combinations and of substantial size. All the ingredients tasked fresh and they use Boars Head meat! Amazing!

I usually get a beer to hold me over while I contemplate which six pack to get from the cooler; usually takes awhile. Since I'm in my twenties it's refreshing to go somewhere at night where there is a younger crowd. People have commented on how this place is too tight/lacking in space. That is True but I feel it only encourages people there to meet others. There has been a couple times, for example, where all seats were taken so my friends and I had to share a bench with other people. We made some friends that night. 5 stars for sure.",

A few things of note about this location:  Seating is horrible...They have room for more tables but for some reason they just don't put them in. If they changed things around they could make more bar seating or add more regular seating. That being said if you're cool with standing and/or leaning while drinking this shouldn't be an issue for you. Outdoor patio is a smoke-fest. If you don't smoke it is reeeeaaaalllly tough to enjoy sitting outside here. Everyone does it and they don't have enough space (very narrow patio) to do it in.   Now on to the good stuff: Staff here is always super friendly! The food is great at this location although I've noticed they sometimes close the deli at odd hours during the weekend (11am one time on a Saturday??)  The place itself never ceases to amaze me - bomb wine selection and fun conversation pieces everywhere.  Oh yea and drinks are cheap!",

Indeed, I have nearly lost friendships for failing to introduce them to this place in a timely enough manner.  While I can certainly understand the complaints about seating (indeed seating is limited), I see CM as a market first and as an alcohol-imbibing location as secondary. Think of it this way: how many seats does Harris Teeter next door provide for patrons drink their purchases? Exactly.   So despite any shortcomings, it is enough for me that one can drink a beer on tap or a glass of wine WHILE ordering a fantastic deli sandwich (they have a great deal for grilled cheese and soup) and getting a few snacks WHILE forging through what is probably the best wine and beer selection this side of town. Add fun wine flights and beer tastings alongside live music and you have a winning combination.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and can recommend some great finds or order discounted bulk of your favorite drinks. And in a final coup de gras, CM has some legit sake and plum wine (not the crap you usually find in restaurants) that was actually made in Japan. This makes me very happy.",

The food has always been great and I didn't find it bland like some previous posters. I'm not sure what they ordered but everything I've tried has hit the spot. Even their spicy food is well done. Their pepper filled Dragon Slayer breakfast sandwich hits the spot... spicy but not so much you can't taste the rest of the ingredients.  So far I've only hung out here in the morning but heard it's a fun place to be in the evening as well.",

This is definitely the place for the eclectic crowd and is perfect for the Plaza-Midwood-Commonwealth area. There are tables outside to eat, converse and drink at. You can also bring your four legged friends with you. Lots of beer and wine to choose from inside. Of course they have your typical convenient store snacks but what I liked most was the vegan/vegetarian selection at the deli and a large variety of different juices and beverages that would don't normally find in your everyday grocery store. I think next time I'll try the Common Market at South End. Thats more of my type of crowd.",

This location with it's new outdoor patio out front really has a following it seems.  We stopped in just the other day on a weekday and the place was packed.  Be aware the parking out front is weird and you basically have to back into a parking spot.  Strange and awkward.    I come here for the beer selection, that's the main reason.  They always have good taps on deck and the bottle selection is equally impressive.",

We actually had a mission to find a couple specific beers that we had sampled at the BBQ, Beer, and Bourbon Festival at Southpark the other weekend.  I was a Common Market Virgin up to this point, but as soon as you walk in the door, the place and ambiance gives you a huge hug of uniqueness - music is blaring, tons of selections of beer and wine,  people having good conversation, or just hanging out on their tiny, but awesome patio.  We definitely had fun looking for the beer... AND WE FOUND IT!  Well, just one of the two kinds we were pining for.  I ended up being intrigued by a bottle of wine (it's label and description drew me in)...  I know where to start stalking my wine collection from now!  Very excited and I know I will be back to enjoy the Common Market again.",

It's a really chill place to grab some food and drink and just sit down with friends for some good conversation. I don't drink, so it's a great place to go with friends who do where we can all enjoy our own thing without pressure to order more.  The staff and other people who come here have always been friendly and nice.  And to top it off, they have boar's head meats and cheeses and make a damned good sandwich (breakfast and lunch)!",

Small bar serving wine by the glass, or you could just purchase the bottle!  It's a place where you can go to socialize and not break the bank.  There was live music this night in the alleyway/patio area.  The thing I did not like about Common Market was how tight it was.  You could hardly maneuver in and out of the building because of the crowd of people.  I felt very claustrophobic and like I was at a street festival, which is not a feeling I like.  There is also zero air circulation in this alley area so if you are not a smoker, I would not recommend.  I have heard that the food is great!  I live right down the street but haven't tried it yet.  Wanted to update this- I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon so I missed the deli service, but I did grab a premade tuna wrap and a huge vegan cupcake.  The tuna wrap was nothing out of the ordinary.  The cupcake was huge and the frosting was great.  I guess they are made at the South End location.",

It was nothing like I expected!  If you are interested in getting food made you go in and take a left and you place your order there... they also have breakfast which I wasn't aware of before. You can get chips and other things in the market area as well.  They also not only have a wide selection of drinks but also beers on tap which is awesome. If you aren't in the mood for beer you can always grab wine or even champagne and also some orange juice if you would like to make your own mimosa!  They have two outdoor seating areas, one out front and one in the back that is a non smoking porch and totally covered. We ate out there and we really enjoyed it, it was much more quiet than the front area too.  The guy who helped us with our beer was awesome too, he knew a lot about the kinds they offered and even gave us several samples to try before we ordered. We will def. be going back here regularly!",

Coming from New York, there weren't many deli/bodegas where people could buy cases of beer straight out of the fridge to go drink in the sitting area outside.  That's pretty cool.  Their prices are reasonable too.  I got two drafts of beer for around $9.  Beware: if you are not a hipster and if you don't like hipsters, this is NOT your place.  As we walked in to people smoking outside in their ripped shirts and jeans and old dockers, I immediately felt overdressed.  And I was wearing a tank top and a long skirt, nothing fancy.  Everyone has long hair of some sort whether its shaggy long or spiked up in a huge mohawk.  And the live music turned out to be a guy in a furry homemade suit (a hacked up teddy bear attached to a bearskin rug) singing with a puppet and then a local band that was using a trash can with a tambourine taped to it as a drum.  It was definitely an interesting scene, and can be fun if you're in the right mindset, but if being around a lot of people who are trying hard to look like they're not trying hard is not for you, you may want to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "This place rocks!  Went here with the boyfriend, we had no idea what it was like and were very pleasantly surprised! Order food in the sandwich shop, they'll deliver it to you if you go to the bar (they are in separate parts of the building). They have beers on tap or any and every beer out there (ice cold) to choose from in their beer coolers. You can open a beer and drink while you shop! :-)  They also have a nice wine selection, and the staff has rated some themselves (which I love!). They have old fashioned candy and food items, old timey sodas, etc. This place is my new favorite place and I will go back again and again!  They have an outdoor eating area, and pooches are welcome!  You MUST try their pimento cheese-they have won some serious awards with their recipe, which consists of at least 5 cheeses, made fresh daily! Their grilled pimento cheese sandwich with tomato is FANTASTIC!  This place gets an A+++++ :-)",

Great little deli attached to this one where you can get a nice sandwich.  Very fun items for sale and eclectic atmosphere.    I love sitting in the back where you can have some quiet drinking time.  There are fun items for sale back there - nostalgic to the just silly!!!  Get a sixer to go and tell your friends - what a great spot!",

    "text": "This is a off the beaten path kind of place, but make no misteak about it they are legit. Let me start with the amazing soups i haven't had one yet that disappointed me. My daughter can't get enough of them and she isn't a soup person at all. The creamy shrimp chowder is simply amazing being I'm not a sea food lover so for me to say this goes against my taste buds.... Now on to the sandwiches; the variety is endless because you can build your own and the panini are insane. Any sandwich can be made hot. Again quality ingredients pushed them over the top. Atmosphere is a little on the Corky side, but don't be fooled or put off it's worth a try you won't regret it. The salads and freshly made spreads are worth trying as well",

    "text": "This is a wonderful and quirky convenience store/deli in one of Charlotte's funkier neighborhoods.  It's funky because it's independently owned and not forced to conform to corporate standards.  Common Market has one of the best wine and beer selections around and if you're looking for something in particular or looking for a recommendation the staff is more than willing to help.  Occasionally they have wine and beer tastings.  I've seen concerts there and I've even had a birthday party on the patio.  The patio is cool as well - 4 tables nestled in a quiet space in the back.  I haven't eaten anything from the deli other than the hummus but I hear it is fantastic.  Kudos to the ownership and staff of Common Market for making something funky in the QC!",

After dinner at Midwood Smoke I was looking to grab a few local beers for the evening and also to bring back to Ohio!  This place was amazing! The beer selection was fantastic! Unicorn Tears....so delicious!  Guy working the counter came over and helped us pick a few delicious local favorites.  Great place in a fun little neighborhood.",

    "text": "This place is dope. Breakfast is not often a meal you enjoy out- at least in my case. But rolling into Common Market and hitting the deli for breakfast should not be missed. They offer killer affordable breakfast sandwiches. Sunday they do homemade queso for your ranchero wrap and I guess topping anything you desire. I enjoyed their homemade pimento cheese In a wrap (ever had pimento cheese melted? Nope. Me either. It was yum) they offer tons of vegan and veg options and tons of ready made sides and wraps to go. And yeah a totally rad beer, wine and snack scene. However, I'm here to tell you that breakfast/brunch at the deli counter is not to be missed. Oh and they will do grits with pimento cheese too. Worth it. Take it to go or sit on their newly expanded patio.",
