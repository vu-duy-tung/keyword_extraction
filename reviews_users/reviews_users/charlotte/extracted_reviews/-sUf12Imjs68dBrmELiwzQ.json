I ordered the shitaki mushrooms and fried dumplings, the portions were crazy small for the price, and seriously lacked flavor. Everything was either really bland or entirely too salty. Our server was really helpful and friendly, but that did not make up for the lack of tastyness unfortunately. I have to say this was just not a win for me. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "This is my favourite place to eat in town. A Japanese small plates restaurant. I come here maybe 2-4 times a week after work to have a few small plates and a glass or two of Sapporo. I've been a customer since day one so maybe my review is a bit more biased. I love the staff! I am always treated like family. The owner somehow always manages to come by and tell me hello as I enjoy my meal. The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are bright and know the menu, even if some items seem foreign to the customer.   Izakaya is a specific restaurant that serves small plates meant to share (kind of like Dim Sum) and drink A LOT of beer. Of course, you can order the ramen (which both Tonkotsu and Miso are delicious) and other entrees but the Japanese Tapas is where it really shines. I have had every item on that menu. My favourites are pork belly cuts, takoyaki, yellowtail collar, okonomiyaki, and basically all of their skewers.   The restaurant has a slightly intimate ambiance from the furniture and dim lighting but the music at some times can throw off the mood. The place is great for a date or even just post work meal with a good friend.   ALSO! They serve Hitachino Nest which is a Japanese beer. Sapporo and Asahi are your bud lights but if you really want to treat yourself to some Japanese craft beer, those are the way to go. Extremely hard to find brews. The White ale, red bean ale, and Espresso Stout are a must try.  LASTLY! They serve Authentic Japanese Whiskey and a HUGE variety of Sakes. The Sake from Fukushima is delicate and smooth. It runs down like water so be careful. I didn't know I was tipsy until I tried to stand up. Cheers everyone!  **At the bottom of the menu, it says that the check is split evenly and has an automatic charge for gratuity for large parties. Some extra info in case someone gets upset for not looking at their policy.",

For what they charge, I don't demand perfection, but it would be nice to at least have consistency. Sometimes the ramen broth tastes of nothing, other times it's so salty that you don't eat it. Also, I have a sneaking suspicion that they hold \"reserved\" tables for imaginary customers so that people that are waiting will spend money at the bar during their wait and, when they do, they all of a sudden get sat at a reserved table. That's happened to my group twice now, the third time we didn't want drinks, waited for an absurd amount of time while 3 tables sat empty, and then left and went next door and had a great meal. I'd recommend yama for a delivery/takeout situation if you're in dire need of some ramen, otherwise try other options.",

    "text": "My wife and I have eaten here at least half a dozen times since they have opened.  We really enjoy the smaller portions (kind of like appetizers).  As we like to order a variety of food to share until we are full vs. the typical huge portions that we never fully eat (even as leftovers).  The Food has always been good sometimes great but the inconsistency is kind of annoying.  Normally we get the Asparagus wrapped in Bacon, Scallops wrapped in bacon, Gyoza, Spicy beef, tempura and on some occasions ramen.  The chicken gizzards were tough and overcooked definitely not an item  to order again.  Typically we come here at least once a month or so.  In every case we have always sat away from the window into the kitchen.  On our New Year's Eve visit we were sat at the table directly in front of the kitchen window.  BAD MOVE!!!  My wife sat facing the window and I sat facing the front of the restaurant with my back to the window.  After we placed our order my wife started giving me real-time commentary of the activities of the wait staff and kitchen staff.  Remember this is all in the same prep area for meals going out to customers.  Here is a quick summary:  - About 4-5 employees eating in full view of the window all off two or three plates - These same employees licking their fingers, touching plates and rubbing their faces with their hands - One particular employee washing dishes, going back to eating as well as preparing meals for customers.  I get that employees get hungry during their shift but having them eat in full view of customer's is a poor practice IMO.  In general if there is a window like this for customer's to see what/how the kitchen is run please make sure that they do behave in a professional manner.  Upon our departure we did let the host know of my wife's observations.  He apologized and appeared to be genuinely upset and concerned.  If this is truly supposed to be a high end restaurant they may want to get the kitchen staff at least some uniforms/smocks.  At this point I'm not sure if we are going to go back or not but I hope they truly take this feedback to enhance this area of concern.",

    "text": "I've been here a total of 4 times. I'm not sure I'll ever go back.  Visit #1 - They were most recently opened and my BF and I were anxious to try on a weekend evening. We walked in and waited about 5 mins for anyone to even acknowledge our presence. They were fairly busy and seemed short staffed but I could see open table so surely they would seat right away. Once we were greeted we were told it would be about 5 or 10 mins for a table to be ready. As we were starving we left to go elsewhere.  Visit #2 - Came in with a party of 5 and were seated right away on a Friday night around 7pm. Our waiter asked if it was our first time (it was for all of us) and he proceeded to give us a brief but informative rundown of the menu and took our questions and answered them expertly. I had bacon wrapped asparagus and a drink special. Very Yum! Everyone was very pleased with the service and quality of the dishes.   Visit #3 - Me and the BF came back a few weeks later on a weeknight. Our waiter once again asked us if we wanted a rundown of the menu and we declined as we were both in the mood for Ramen (he had gotten it previously and loved it). This was was the best thing I can remember eating as of late. So much flavor I didn't want to stop eating. I was unable to finish but I was also glad I had enough left over to eat again the next day. We were promptly provide with to-go soup containers to transport our delicious broth and noodles home.  Visit #4 - It is bitterly cold out this winter and I promised the BF I'd grab some Ramen and bring it home for dinner so we could enjoy it bundled up on the couch.  I walked in today and was greeted promptly as the restaurant was empty at 5:30pm on a weekday. This is how the conversation went with the Hostess ...  Me: Hi, Yes ... I'd like to place a take-out order please. Yama: Oh, we don't do that. Me: I can't place an order to take with me? Yama: No, our plates are very small and we just don't do that. Me: But I've been here before an taken my left overs home in a container. Yama: Yeah, we can't do that. But you can sit at the bar and have a drink. Me: Um, no thanks ... I'll figure something else out.  HOW/WHY WOULD YOU REFUSE A PAYING CUSTOMER THAT WANTS TO BUY YOUR FOOD AND LEAVE YOU A TIP FOR PREPARING THE ORDER THAT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN ... NOT TO MENTION HAS BEEN TELLING EVERYONE SHE KNOWS HOW GOOD THE PLACE IS?!  Needless to say, I'm extremely frustrated and disappointed. Really had my heart set on some Ramen but went to Fuel pizza instead (which was super friendly and very delicious).",

Thank you for taking a risk and opening in PM's awkward strip mall. This strip mall has improved so much in the past few years. It is really awesome to see businesses going in there.   We ordered the bacon wrapped asparagus and squid for starters. The asparagus was green asparagus and white asparagus (nice touch).  They were good. I wasn't blown away, but definitely tasty.   We also ordered the pork ramen. THAT MY FRIENDS is delicious. The pork is marinated in teriyaki sauce and it the broth is made over a ridiculous amount of time (8 hours? Something like that). I really want to try the miso and the chicken ramen. I have big plans for eating plenty of ramen this winter. The portion was so large that I have plenty for lunch today. We were stupidly confused by their menu. When it says \"extra\" they mean \"you already have this, but if you want to pay extra for a another egg it is....\". That was our fault, but just wanted to give a heads up to anyone else who also my struggle with reading menus.  Overall, the place is delicious. I think the prices a little high, but not too high to come back. I am interested in trying more of their small bites.",

Then for our meal; I got the shio (chicken broth) with the pork belly which was delicious.

Serves is decent, sometimes you get a waitress/waiter that don't care too much on checking on you then there are times when you do get a great server. I'm a server for 6 years so I know half ass serve when I see it. I highly recommend the tonkotsu and the asparagus wrapped with bacon! Tonkotsu here is always on point! I wish they had more option of spice. They have this pepper flake and chill oil thing but I used about a half of each and extra extra jalapeno to get it really spicy. So it would be nice to have more spice options. I really wanted to give them a 4.5 star but the reason I wouldn't give them 5 star is because they have this policy where if there is 6 or more people they split the whole bill between everyone. I never heard of this before in my life and it is a little confusing. So if you are cool with that then awesome but if your not, I suggest to go with no more then 5 people. I highly recommend this place!!! Tonkotsu is the best here!!!",

Also added a small bite of Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly). It was soaked in a ginger type sauce. It was good.   Ordered the Tonkostu (pork bone broth). This was amazing!! This is what made my experience. The pork broth soup has been simmering for about 12 hours. Very flavorful that came with a creamy base. On top was braised pork belly that were sliced very thin. Along with the pork came bamboo shoots, half of a hard boiled egg, and the ramen noodle.  The ramen noodle had a good texture. The noodle soaked up the pork broth sauce well. I also ordered extra noodles in my dish and it was very filling!   If you are looking for a new restaurant in the Charlotte area and looking for that Ramen fix, I would highly suggest this place. It is worth the $14 for a bowl of Ramen soup. Next time I would like to try the Soba Noodles.",

But when I arrive they told us that they close at 11:00 and last call was at 10:30pm.   I told them their website said they close at 11:30. They told me that I should have called. Then I told them I called and their answering machine said they close at 11:30 as well.   Needless to say the I was unable to eat a delicious bowl of ramen.   The owner there should really be up on their business",

The pan seared pork dumplings were the best I've had in a long time.  The sauce that comes with them was sooooo good. I also tried the octopus for the first time.  It was good (if you like oysters).  It had a spicy wasabi taste to it. The Ramen was wonderful!!! I got the spicy miso broth. Great place to try!",

I like going to restaurants near here because in parking-challenging places like Plaza Midwood, having a no cost big parking lot is a plus.. We started with Nigori sake. Cold and refreshing compared to others I have tasted.  We got a small plate of beef wrapped asparagus and an order of shumai. The beef was tasty- the asparagus still had good crunch and the meat was tender. The shrimp shumai was not the best I've had.. a bit gummy.  Our server ...hmm. Frankly, we were very engaged in our conversation so I didn't chat with her like I usually do so can't remark on her personality, etc. She was efficient and we had everything we needed so that's a plus.  The menu has lots of options, some look somewhat outside the box, so I can't wait to come back and try more items.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Yama Izakaya, a Japanese tavern in the Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte on a rare dinner review. This small and trendy restaurant is tucked into a shopping center, so parking is not a problem.   They offer a variety of small plates, specialty dishes, and the main dish that called us, ramen. After our first experience with ramen in DC, we planned to share, so we started with a couple small plates. First up was the Gyoza, pan-fried pork dumplings. Soft on the outside, tender and full of favor on the inside, and served with a Japanese dipping sauce that would have been great on anything. Dora here. Light, delicate, delicious!  We also tried the Fried Chicken Wings. They appeared to be like typical chicken wings until I took the first bite. The waiter told us they were seasoned with a Korean chili spice. Whatever it was, they definitely had a unique favor and were crispy and juicy.  Dora here. I wish I was a fan of chicken wings because they always smell delicious! I gave these a try, but they didn't tempt me with a second bite.   Now if you have never tasted ramen, you are missing out. Ramen is an Asian-style soup with noodles, and we chose the Miso Ramen. Marinated Braised Pork Belly (chashu), seaweed (nori), sesame seeds, scallions, bamboo shoots (menma), seasoned egg (sometimes called a Ramen egg), corn, and colorful fish cakes. The ramen was very good and the taste of the pork and seafood rose above everything else.   Dora here. Don't let all the names scare you. It's just a soup with some deliciously flavorful elements. Tasty, warm, and a wonderful go-to comfort food in winter. This photo really doesn't do the serving size justice. It's a HUGE bowl! We ordered extra toppings in DC, but forgot to do that this time. If you plan to share, adding extra toppings might make it a bit beefier, er...porkier. :) Oh, and the restaurant rates this \"spicy.\" Maybe a little kick but definitely not a forehead slicker. Go for it!  Our server might've scored higher if he didn't keep pushing the Sake and spoke a little slower for us hearing-challenged folks. And the music? Hoping that same constant beat changes before our next visit. :)  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

Place was pretty quiet and empty and ambience-wise less than I expected.  Our waitress was super sweet and nice and explained anything we needed to know about the menu.  We ordered the pork belly steamed buns, fried squid legs, octopus balls and pork ramen.    The fried squid legs were underwhelming- not much flavor and no flavorful sauce for them.  They were pretty good on their own but I wish there was a good garnish or sauce for them.  Octopus balls were gross.  Didn't know what to expect honestly but the texture was mushy and mysterious, and I was looking forward to the rubbery, smooth octopus texture.    Pork belly buns were good but again, underwhelming.  Pork belly itself was good but that was all that was on the bun.  I had high expectations because I tried my first pork belly bun at Futo Buta and it was amazing so I hoped this would be as good or better.  Ramen was good but again, not the best!  The ingredients themselves in the bowl looked dull and unappetizing.  Especially the poached egg that was seemingly grey.  Noodles themselves were very thin and overdone in my opinion.  The ramen at Futo Buta was thicker with a nicer bite to it, and the broth wasn't as thick but had more flavor.  Overall, a good place if you want to satisfy a ramen craving, but I don't think I'll be back as long at Futo Buta is around.",

    "text": "The family and I decided to try a Japanese restaurant on our visit to Charlotte. After living in Japan for nearly eight years, we were intrigued by an Izakaya in Charlotte.  We were surprised upon arriving the location is in a strip mall. We could see it was in an up and coming neighborhood with all kinds of trendy establishments nearby.   The interior was well decorated. Aesthetically pleasing. We were immediately seated near the back of the restaurant. Our server took our drink and food orders and brought our drinks shortly thereafter. We ordered lamb yakitori, potato croquettes, tonkatsu, yaki udon, and teriyaki chicken.   The appetizers were delivered a short time before our meals. The lamb yakitori was tasty as were the croquettes. My son thought there was too much vegetables with his teriyaki chicken. It was a lot! The yaki udon was decent I guess. The tonkatsu was plentiful and delicious.  Overall we were pleased with our visit here. If we're in the area we would possibly dine here again.   Note: most of the employees seemed unhappy to be there. Thought it was strange.",

The egg was well seasoned but the broth didn't have enough flavor.    Pork Belly Buns --- super tender and flavorful, I would give it 5 stars if it had more pickled vegetables (acidity) to cut the sweetness of the sauce.  Lamb Cumin Skewers --- not the best I've had but I'd still recommend it.  Spicy Beef Skewers --- This packed a pretty good punch actually, I would give it 5 stars if the beef was a little more tender.    Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collarbone) --- This was an off-menu special last night, and was the hands down star of the show.  First of all, the portion. This was the most generous portion I've ever had.  Second, the char / crispiness. This was superbly grilled!  I would come back for this alone (but would have the check that it's available as this is on special only).  Lastly, the server was very friendly and attentive.  The food is really 3 stars, elevated an extra half point for the awesome hamachi kama and another extra half point for the good service.",

    "text": "I'm an izakaya novice and ignoramus.  In fact, Yama was only the second restaurant I've ever been to that labels itself as such.  The first was one that the wife and I visited a few years back in Vancouver, and that was one of the better restaurant experiences we've had in the last several years.  So Yama had a lot to live up to, and given Vancouver's status as an Asian-food mecca, I wasn't expecting all that much out of an \"izakaya\" in a strip center in Charlotte, at least by comparison.    But Yama was not bad.  Not bad at all.  First off, the centerpiece of the meal, tonkatsu ramen, wasn't the greatest.  I'm also a relative ramen novice.  I've seen the on-line arguments about whether ramen or pho is better, and as somebody's who's had boatloads of pho over the years, I'd vote for the latter.   Yama's ramen didn't do anything to tilt the balance in my mind. The broth in Yama's tonkatsu was a little lackluster, but it was still a hearty, satisfying bowl of soup.  (All that said, I'm confident I've yet to experience great examples of ramen.)  Yama scored higher points on the izakaya stuff:  For instance, cumin lamb skewers from the yakitori menu were robustly seasoned and just about perfectly cooked.  Wasabi tako, which is small bits of raw octopus in a light wasabi sauce, had a delicious balance of salt, vinegar, and heat.  I feel like we had a third thing, but can't remember--either way, those first two were worthwhile enough!  Yama has a dark and cavernous feel--and as you might expect, its decor tends toward the slick, modern, and urbane--but it was comfortable with not-annoying noise levels.  Service was fine on this not-very-busy evening.",

When I first moved to the QC in 2005 there was no ramen to be found and saying ramen got you odd looks, like you were referring to \"cup o noodle\" or something. I moved back to California and years later I am back in the QC again.. this time finding ramen is so much easier... and this is one of the great places to get it.  Back home in California there is a place called Noodle World.. nothing fancy.. it's good ramen though and you can always get in and chill with your friends.. this place reminds me of it.  I love the low key atmosphere, the decent prices, good drinks and YUMTASTIC ramen and other treats. I wish I could eat here more often, if I lived closer to this side of town I think I would be in here all the time. :)    When I was in Japan, our favorite place had one counter - no tables... just a single counter with seats and men making ramen in giant pots.. and it was AMAZING..  ever since that night I have been a ramen fiend... so it's comforting to know Charlotte is now a ramen city. :)  They have a lot of other great items - don't think if you don't like ramen that you can't come here. They have some sushi, tempura and other small plates. You will like it, try it!  *Slurp*",

I had really high hopes for the Beef Negimake, which has asparagus, scallions and meat, three things I love. It was underwhelming. Not a lot of flavor. The Vegetarian Gyoza may as well have been vegan gyoza; it had almost no taste and was chewy, not the right consistency. I shouldn't have ordered the potato croquettes. They were not good at all! Even the iced tea was bitter. In a city with lots of choices, and Asian Fusion on every third block, you are better off going elsewhere. Pei Wei would've been a better choice.",

    "text": "Exactly as Yelp describes, Yama Izakaya is A-OK.  I had very high hopes coming here, I saw great side dishes and i was extremely excited to try the Ramen in the Charlotte area. Unfortunately, I thought this place was nothing too special.  First and foremost, their menu had a great variety of small dishes, we tried the seaweed salad and the takokayki. They were both fine, but honestly, I thought the prices for the small dishes was incredibly pricey. I believe they were ranged from 7-13, and for small dishes that's supposed to precede before the main dishes, I couldn't really justify ordering more than two even though there was a good amount of things I wanted to try.  Ramen wise, it was fine, nothing spectacular. The shape of their bowl is a little awkward and deep which makes it kind of hard to fish out everything. When i was almost finished, I realized there were a lot of chasu left at the bottom that I almost missed. Noodles were cooked fine, and the broth was well seasoned, but again, I didn't think the flavors were amazing.  Overall, the interior was quite dim, but it's perfect for a date. A good amount of booth sitting, and a few bigger tables in the middle. The decor was quite modern, and I really enjoyed staying there and it was all very comfortable.  Food wise, nothing wowed me enough to go back combined with the pricey menu, I would say if you're just visiting, you wouldn't be missing out on much if you skipped this place.",

However on this visit we explored the unique and traditional Japanese dishes and were impressed with the authenticity. Raw octopus which I have never seen in a restaurant served with some kind of fresh wasabi. Very good. Grilled whole small squid, very much similar to what was found at Mai, the late great Charlotte Japanese restaurant. Vegetable gyoza, fresh made and seared with a vinegar sauce. Monkfish liver, the foie gras of the sea, not often found anywhere, was very good. Grilled duck yaktori, extremely tender. Would definitely recommend for the appetizer. Maybe have a couple here and go next door to Bistro Le Bon for more.",

Kakuni buns are 3 small sliders, tops with Hoisin sauce that is too sweet for the taste.  Was looking for a more appealing taste than hoisin sauce.  Seriously.  Takoyaki doesn't use takoyaki sauce.  It tastes very weird.  Ramen is the top disappointment of all.  No nori and toppings are limited.  The bowls are full of msg, it made me to drink lot of water to overcome.  Taste is bland and the soups are made with mixtures.  Noodles are soggy and bland as well.  Oh yea, the sushi roll definitely not worth $14. Not even of one slice of raw fish.  I know, I shouldn't complain about their sushi or ramen since they are not their specialty.  No condiments available, at least to try to make a better taste myself.  Disappointed.",

I started with the blueberry mojito (YUM) and my husband had the warm house sake. *at this type of restaurant the style is to order a drink while eating small plates first then fill up on a noodle dish.* We ordered the beef gyoza which was the most delish in Charlotte I've had, followed by a shrimp tempura sushi roll topped with tuna, and ending with my fav, pork belly buns. I couldn't possibly order a noodle dish... after I saw one come out, they are HUGE! The overall experience was so relaxed and the food was well spaced so you could enjoy each bite.

As an expert in Chinese and Japanese food and already tried 100+ different Chinese and Japanese restaurants in US, I have to say the ramen in this restaurant is authentic.  As I mentioned in my other reviews, there are 3 main factors of a ramen: Broth, Noodles, Side dishes. The key of a good ramen is all about the BROTH! I tried the Tonkotsu broth which is flavorful, rich and creamy. The best thing is the noodle fully absorbed the flavour from the broth.  The noodles are pretty good, they have a springy texture. One more thing I would like mention is for noodles, good or bad is mastered in Chef's hands. Noodles should not be too hard or too soft but just right!   The side dishes for ramen are superb. They added bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and onsen eggs etc. I do appreciate they go with a very traditional way on the side dishes. This is the authentic ramen I want.  One happy suprise from this restaurant is their small bites. Most of them are pretty decent and tasty.  Above all, I do recommend this restaurant for ramen lovers!",

    "text": "Many Koreans and Japanese not only share the Siberian nomadic genes from the prehistoric migration, we share a lot of similar types of food. Korean Denjang and Japanese Miso, Korean Memil and Japanese Soba, Korean Gimbab and Japanese Nigiri are just a few examples. The cultural similarities including culinary are probably the reason why the two, even after battling for more than 5 centuries, relate to each other overseas. Sure we had horrible wars. Korea won in 1592, Japan annexed Korea diplomatically in 1909. But there are numerous similarities whether the two would like to admit or not. Hey the Japanese royals admitted they're descendants of a Korean prince who emigrated to the island. As much as Japanese love Korean popular culture, Koreans enjoy Japanese Ramen and Udon. And I love Ramen and Udon! Seriously.  I could have that stuff everyday in winter. I mean, it's my substitute for summer Nangmyun. But it has to be done right. You know, Asian food in Charlotte is 1) rare, and 2) nooooot really authentic. Yama Izakaya, however, was legit. I'm talking, this-shiz-can-make-it-in-Asia authentic. The Okinomiyaki was good but better in Fukuoka. But the ramen was just as good as the stuff I had in Osaka. I haven't tried their sushi but I'm sure it's similar with the stuff I had in Tokyo. I went last Friday night and went back the next night! The best part is that the man of the house gave us Galbi and Gimchi for free. He is pretty cool. All in all, I'm really happy there's a proper Asian food place in town besides one at the edge of the CLT universe and another at the outer clusters. After Miyagi's closed down, I was hoping someone would step up. Here it is.  *I realize that this review has become somewhat a history lecture but I'm sure you awesome Yelpers will appreciate learning something new while deciding what to eat, right? Thought so.",

We also had the Gyoza and Ebi Shumai. It's nice to have a different take on Japanese food than the tired, overdone and bland Hibachi grill, or the generic asian restuarant with Sushi.  On our second visit we both got ramen. I had the tonkostu, pork bone broth, which seems to be a less common offering. It was quite good (though I'd also recommend Musashi for it, that place is out of the way but so delicious). My girlfriend was quite happy with her ramen, and she is fussy about her Japanese food after having lived a couple of years in Japan. The ramen comes with all the standard toppings, and options of adding more if need, though I don't see why you would as it was already filling as it was.  My only complaint is that some of the items on the menu are light on descriptions. I can understand trying to keep it simple, but we watched an adjacent table go though probably 10 things on the menu asking for more information on what it was. They could also be a bit clearer that the extras column for Ramen is and addition by specifying what comes in the standard ramen order. You don't want a customer thinking they have to pay an extra $4 for pork (chashu? just call it pork or at least explain that means pork), when it comes with plenty to begin with.",

This has to be one of my favorites. The sweet potato perfects the roll. Next, My boyfriend ordered teriyaki chicken & he absolutely loved the sweet flavor of the teriyaki and the tenderness of the chicken. It was cooked just right. I got the tonkatsu ramen, and I just have to say, this is probably the best ramen house in Charlotte. I highly recommend and will come back again. To end on a final note, the restaurant is clean & feels very \"chill\".",

    "text": "The food at Yama Izakaya is good but not great. I do love the atmosphere of the restaurant. There is lounge-like seating area at the front and a nice bar area. Our waiter was also very good.  Tonkostu Ramen: 3.5 stars. The broth was delicious; rich but not too viscous. The thin noodles were great. I liked the egg and bamboo shoots as well. However, I thought the pork chashu was mediocre at best. The chashu was thinly sliced and lacking flavor. I think they should drop the fishcake altogether as it makes the ramen bowl appear low quality.  Takoyaki Octopus balls: 4 stars. I really enjoyed the takoyaki. The octopus balls were flaky on the outside and flavorful inside.  Osaka sushi roll: 3.5 stars. This could easily be a great Sushi roll if they would only add avocado or cucumber. There are some scallions sprinkled on top of the roll but the roll still tasted incomplete from a texture and flavor standpoint. The seared tuna and flaky tempura desperately need smooth avocado to balance out the roll. I thought it was strange that they had a completely separate sushi menu.  Spicy cumin lamb yakitori: 3.5 stars. The lamb was decent. It was rather heavy on the cumin but I did not find the lamb spicy. The meat was a bit chewy.  Duck negi yakitori: 3.5 stars. the duck was tasty but I didn't care much for the sauce on the skewer which tasted like barbecue sauce.",

Food: 4  Duck skewer: 5 stars  I really liked the meat and flavors on this skewer   Octopus balls: 5 stars Absolutely loved the fish flakes and how the balls are nicely proportion with octopus. The balls had a nice fresh crunch and then softness insides then chewy octopus center in a good way.  Sushi: 3.5 stars So we didn't even know they served rolls until we were about to leave and saw someone else getting a roll that was so appealing to the eyes that we had to get one. We thought it was too plain and missing an ingredient. It only had tempura shrimp in the center and tuna on top, wish it had some more ingredients on the inside to accompany the shrimp.  Tonkatsu Ramen: 3 stars Broth was decent, I liked the flavors. The only reason the ramen was our least favorite is because the pork was basic and thin, lack veggies.  Lamb skewer: 3.5 stars The meat was delicious the texture and flavors aren't my cup of tea  Bryan, our server was great! We were excited to try small plates but very hungry so we asked for a tonkatsu ramen & octopus balls to share as we browse through the menu to decide on another ramen or lots of small plates and skewers. Bryan checked back to make sure we were or weren't ready to order. Water was constantly filled. He even gave us wonderful suggestions of places to see around the area.",

The second appetizer was edemame, which was classic and high quality with the perfect amount of salt. Third was the steamed shrimp dumplings, which were incredibly flavorful. The best part was definitely the Tonikotsu Ramen. It was delicious and flavorful. The egg was such high quality that the yolk was bright and the bone broth was incredible and rich.

    "text": "I've held off on going to Yama Izakaya for quite a while, unsure of the menu.  But, it was a cool night and I was craving some delicious ramen - so, we hopped in the car for a short trip the tiny strip mall in Plaza Midwood.    We arrived around 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night to a fairly empty restaurant.  Some restaurants in PM can be have later crowds, so while I was a bit surprised, we weren't deterred.  The venue is beautiful inside - very intimate and classy.    We started out with some wine, sake and shitake and spicy squid yakatori.  The shitake yakatori was tasty with a nice, savory/sweet sauce on it. The squid was quite spicy and over-cooked - little too chewy for my taste.    We both ordered bowls of ramen - I had the pork ramen, my partner order the spicy miso.  While they were (of course!) quite filling with noodles, some veggies and pork - the broths were not overly flavorful.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by another ramen place across town, but I wanted a bit more complexity to the flavor.    While it will do in a pinch, Yama Izakaya did not stand out as outstanding.  It was warming and filled a craving, but I don't imagine we'll be back on a regular basis - which I do find quite disappointing.",

I've loved it for 2 years...but today I had luke warm Tonkotsu Ramen with very little broth and the noodle texture was all wrong. I've had this ramen over and over again, but am a little disappointed in the quality.   I had the Hamachi nigiri as well and the temperature felt off on that too. My husband had the Udon noodles and had no complaints though.   Lastly, it was FREEZING inside so we opted to move outside and our waitress had no problem with it. Not saying this is an overall negative review because 4/5 times its great here, but somewhat out of the ordinary...going to give it another try eventually.",

    "text": "The Japanese izakaya is an emerging trend following the American sushi craze. A traditional izakaya isn't a sushi bar, but has a variety of simple, homestyle Japanese dishes that can be enjoyed as small bites. Think of a Japanese version of a tapas bar and you get the idea.  Yama Izakaya is a good rendition of a neighborhood joint you might find in Tokyo. The menu is varied and features yakitori (charcoal-grilled meats on a skewer), ramen, and all manner of snacky items. I tried the homemade gyoza and it was one of the few times I've seen it properly prepared in the US. These are pork dumplings that should have a soft texture with a lightly pan fried side; that's exactly how they came out on our plates. Tonkotsu ramen was also delicious and included noodles, thinly-sliced tender pork, soft-boiled egg, and slices of kamaboko (fish cakes). The beef negi featured extremely tender beef wrapped around asparagus and covered in a light gravy sauce that was delicious. Tempura was spot on, lightly fried batter that did not overwhelm the vegetables and shrimp inside.  Service was very good and our server kept up with the steady arrival of items from the kitchen. In an izakaya, food is brought out when it is ready, not in courses as we typically expect in other restaurants. In this way, food is always fresh and never sits under a warmer waiting for the rest of the meal to be finished. With its extended evening hours, it would make a great place for a light meal after a movie or other event, or a place to enjoy some refreshments along with some alcoholic beverages. Recommended.",

My husband got excited about the Takoyaki because it's sometimes hard to find in Upstate SC. He thought they were pretty good, but it's not my thing. The chicken negi and duck negi were pretty tasty.   We both got the tonkatsu ramen. *I dream about this ramen.* It was so flavorful and filling. Best ramen I've ever had. I look for reasons to go to Charlotte now so we can get that ramen again!   The place is kind of chic with a lounge area with couches but still has plenty of tables. It's a really nice atmosphere in an almost questionable-looking part of town. But so worth it!   Basically, if you love ramen...go here!!!!",

Barely any toppings on the ramen save bamboo. Pretty disappointed. Had much better ramen in Mooresville.   Also ordered the special spicy squid legs. It was not spicy. And it was deep fried, which I was not expecting. Tasted pretty stale. Also disappointing.",

It was a bit hard to see from the road and we were sceptical with the outward appearance of the plaza being...I'll be kind and say it looks \"run down.\"   The interior is simple, but clean and with a good atmosphere for romantic dinners and small groups alike. Service was great with the server and chef working together to make sure we got everything we ordered despite some items being out of stock. We ordered and shared many small plates, but if you only get one you must try the beef negimaki! Can't wait to go again!",

We started with drinks; long island iced tea top shelf for my gf and the Red Dragon martini for me.  Both drinks were amazing. The Red Dragon martini featured whole lychee fruit which was a special touch.  Now, on to the food. My gf started with the grilled Brussel Sprouts which were just the perfect balance of a charred outside and firm,  yet chewy inside splashed with soy sauce. I chose the braised pork belly buns and I'm going to tell you.. everything about it was wonderful! The pork was perfectly caramelized and tender, nestled in between pillow soft buns.  Next up was seafood ramen for my gf. What I loved is that although this wasn't on the menu,  the chef had no problem preparing it.  I had a Tonkatsu bowl and it was absolutely incredible! I can honestly say that this ramen featured one of the best broths that I've tasted this far.  I could really tell that the pork broth was truly homemade. No box broth here!   For wonderful ramen, great music and a cool, laid back atmosphere, do yourself a favor and visit!",

And since asparagus is included, it must be good for you, right? The seaweed salad was well-seasoned. Tasty tempura, well-done dumplings, and al-dente ramen rounded out a great meal. Looking forward to trying more of the yakitori. So pleased to see another great addition to our neighborhood's restaurant scene.",

    "text": "I have an affinity for Japanese food and more recently had realized the lack of good Japanese places to frequent in the Plaza Midwood area. My go-to is Akahana for sushi, but their entrees are primarily Vietnamese and Chinese, which doesn't help curve my craving for teriyaki chicken or hibachi steak. Of course, I didn't realize Yama Izakaya is right around the corner now, and so I  took my lady out on a Friday night.   The decorum is dope. Definitely Japanese themed with their own flare, so it doesn't beat you over the head. The bar section seats probably more than 15 patrons with only two tv's, so you can focus on the food and drinks, you know, being social.  As far as dinner goes, I've never been to Japanese tapas bar, and I can't say I've tried any of the tapas as I had a hankering for teriyaki chicken; my girlfriend got the miso ramen, which was stacked. BUT, to the point of ordering a simple dish, it was excellent. I think if you can make something basic taste fantastic, then you're onto something and the fact that our meals were great is a good early indicator of the rest of their menu.  We had some traditional Japanese soda (Ramune) and toasted rice tea. I'm not bummed about the lack of sushi, because I can still go to Akahana (.25 mile up the road) for a great deal. We're definitely going back on a less frigid evening (9 degrees out) when we have plans to stay out after dinner, and enjoy their tapas menu and some of their Japanese whiskey and Mochi!",

However things are never the same from one visit to the next. Last time there was no meat in the soup this time there was. Last time they gave an assortment of fresh veggies this time only a heaping hand full of canned bamboo shoots. Really? The pork broth is my favorite by far but I feel like I never know what to expect. They also do not allow for call in orders or takeout. You are asked to order your food and then box it yourself if you want to take it home. Strange!! I really wish they would turn down the extreamly loud music and realize they are not a uppity night club.",

A few downfalls: My dinner partners food (chicken something or other with noodles - not 100% sure) was way less than good - like way less than good. The server was obviously super new at the game and wicked nervous. He came to the table 9 million times - but I get that... 1st day on the job. I didn't like that the things that we ordered were one price on the menu and another price on the bill (every item we ordered).  I do look forward to returning to try something new very soon but I hope that it is a little more smooth the next time I stop in. As they are very new I am sure that the kinks are still being worked out. I say try it for sure.... It was a great rainy day choice.",

Both times I have ordered the Tonkostu Ramen.  The broth has good flavor and the portion is very generous.  My only very small complaint is that I love soft boiled eggs in ramen and this place seems to serve hard boiled eggs.  I have also shared the tempura sampler, shrimp shumai, beef wrapped in asparagus, seaweed salad and shishito peppers.  All were good but I did not care for the shumai much, it was sort of fishy.   Overall good place and I will be back.",

Along with that had the Shishito peppers, hamachi jalapeno and squid salad.

I was a little worried this wouldn't fill me up, but that was not the case. I had to take a break, after finishing mine before proceeding to finish the one my girlfriend ordered. The broth was so good I couldn't stop eating, even though I was really full. I am not proud of that, but it was all just too good. Before coming here I didn't even like Japanese food. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood. It was a little on the expensive side, but totally justified.

Although a bit pricey (compared to Japan, but makes sense for america), the food is phenomenal and very authentic. While my friends and I were there we got a bunch of small plates and then split the bill, which is how it usually works in Japan. The okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and the grilled squid are great. The taco wasabi is good, but don't order it if you aren't familiar with it, its more of an acquired taste. And the yakitori are superb. I've been to Japan, and have been to plenty of izakayas, and Yama Izakaya has met my expectations on terms of food and taste. I plan to visit again soon to try their ramen. If you're looking for a place to have a legit real Japanese experience and have real Japanese food while enjoying a few drinks with friends , I would highly recommend this place.

I ordered to Tonkatsu ramen, a popular favorite, and it was absolutely delicious.  This time I ordered the grilled duck as a small bite and they did a really great job.  The server was super attentive and their cocktail menu is pretty decent as well.  If you're up for some refreshing food during cold weather you may want to check this place out.",

As did the gyoza, again straight from a store brought package to the pan. When our food came out, the ramen noodle is very evident it was also store brought. Also saw the ice cream mochi dessert at the table next to us and all there was is a couple of store brought ice cream mochi and a few pocky sticks from the Asian market. Do yourself a favor, save your money by stopping by the Asian market and make yourself the same meal for less than half the price.",

After the closing of Nom Nom Burgers, I've been desperate for a good bowl of ramen. I got it!  The pork broth ramen was excellent. My husband's fried noodles were good, too.

    "text": "First off I think it is hilarious that some people are taking off stars and confused about the ramen offerings here thinking that they needed to pay extra for noodles or adding in items and not ordering it at all instead of simply asking about it. Having eaten in ramen shops up and down the eastern and western coast I feel like I have to say this is simply how ramen is listed. Now on to the actual review.  Having drunken quite a fair bit and needing some food before resuming the aforementioned drinking fellow yelper Jonathon B. and I stumbled in here at around 9:30-10? for some grub. Well I have to say the place looks kinda cool, unfortunately we happened to be here at the worst possible time as a humongous group of people decided on this joint as the place to celebrate a birthday bash. Believe me it was highly annoying when all you can hear during a meal is constantly CHUG CHUG CHUG and FUCK YEAH BRO! Believe it or not it is okay to tell your guests to respect the other guests around them and stop yelling in your establishment.  Spying monkfish liver on the menu I went with it because who doesn't love the Foie gras of the sea as an appetizer! I regretted it. While the texture is excellent the pairing of salmon ikura on top leaves it tasting so fishy that the pool of vinegar at the bottom failed to brace it down to tolerable levels. I also tried some of my dining partner's beef negimaki. The beef is nice, the asparagus is well cooked, but the presentation makes it pretty hard to eat. Shortly afterwards our ramen came out though and it was pretty good! The broth is very porky, makes me wonder if they didn't do the traditional parboiling to neutralize some of that or something. Anyways I like it but some people may not. The side items strewn throughout the soup were adequate if not amazing. The extremely major flaw I actually pointed out to the server was that you have listed a flavored egg as an item in the soup but all we have gotten is a hard boiled egg cut in half. I was met with an actual shrug of the shoulders and an eh! Hey you asked how everything was girl! Seriously though this is not how you should respond to an honest critique, please train your waitstaff better.  In conclusion and the words of our server: eh *shoulder shrug*",

Make sure to start with the excellent seaweed salad. You won't be disappointed. This is my new go-to spot when I want soup/noodles!   Also - staff is charming and helpful. I went on election night and as there wasn't a game on, they were friendly and accommodating when I asked to turn the bar tv to MSNBC to watch election results.

    "text": "I never leave reviews, good or bad, but I feel that this place is bad enough to warrent a review. I was excited to try this place because I love Asian food, especially Japanese. However, I was very dissapointed with the quality of the food. At first I thought I simply didn't like the food, as I ordered several dishes I have never had before. However, even the eel (my favorite type of seafood), was bad. It tasted especially fishy (more so than normal seafood) and the skin was strange and mushy. All of the other dishes (expect the pork belly and mochi) were bad. Soon after my husband and I finished the meal, my husband threw up. He has since thrown up 3 times and has had diarrhea (with blood) several times. I have been nausea ever since we ate. To much information, I know, but I feel it is necessary to share so others may take my story into consideration before eating there. My husband called the restaurant to let them know he was sick and very upset with the food. He did not intend to receive a full refund and was more than willing to let them keep the tip and drink cost. However, the owner (via the server on the phone because the owner couldn't speak directly to my husband?) refused to compensate him in any way until he provided a doctor's note because they supposedly checked their food supply and it was fine. They also claimed  that it takes 12 to 24 hours to show signs of food poisoning. The server explained that upon proof of food poisoning they would give my husband a 50 dollar gift card to the restaurant  (as if we plan on eating there again). While I completely understand why they would be skeptical and wish to protect their business, it seems ridiculous that the owner failed to speak directly with my husband and refused to make the situation right. As far as I am concerned, the owner is not my husband employer and therefore doesn't need a doctor's note. It's not like my husband is trying to sue the restaurant. He simply wanted compensation for a less than satisfactory meal. Had that happened, I wouldn't feel the need to leave a bad review. I guess quality food and customer satisfaction is not important to the owner.",

    "text": "Sigh... I so want to give this place 5 stars!! I love Yama Asian Fusian in South Park and I had really high expectations of their new restaurant. We came not long after they opened with the intent on trying some small bites and getting some ramen.  Small bites first:   Buta Kakuni (pork belly) this was really good. Cooked well but I prefer mine crispier on the outside. This was a little on the soggy side. Just a personal preference though, taste wise it was good!  The hamachi jalepenos were probably a 3-4/5 stars. I adore yellowtail but this pretty much left me underwhelmed.  Gyu Tataki (seared steak) was probably the best thing I ate all night!! Seriously I could eat nothing but a meal of this and some rice... very well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake) I have no idea if this was how it was supposed to taste because I did not like it at all!! My friends said it was pretty good though.   Soba w/Anago minus the anago lol... This was a good dish however we got it about 10-15 minutes after we finished eating.   Gyoza was standard  Ramen:  I was not impressed. The noodles didn't seem to be cooked properly and were clumping together and not very slurpable (new word lol). The quality and flavor just seemed to be off. It definitely was not enough to get us to come there for ramen versus Musashi's.   Overall I would have given this place 4 stars except the service we had was actually kind of terrible. The guy managing the house was one of the servers from Yama and I remember him well. However he seemed overwhelmed. Again they are new so I was cutting them some slack. We needed a table for 3 and he said it would be a few minute wait for a table to leave and be cleared off so we went to the bar. A table left and no one had cleaned it off but they appeared busy. Another couple came in and a waitress went up to them and attempted to give them the table we were waiting on. At this point we'd been waiting for about 15 minutes staring at an empty dirty table for 10 of those minutes so we were a little peeved. I went up to her and said we've been waiting for that table for 10 minutes. The manager put our names on the list and she just completely ignored it. There were 2 person tables along the wall as well. She got really defensive and kind of nasty with me, again losing points. Our waiter came by eventually and could 100% not be bothered with us. He was not happy to be waiting on us and I think he may have been ill. He would disappear for long long stretches of time and it took FOREVER to get through this meal. About halfway through the meal after he had to go put a few of our items in for order because he forgot I saw him bookbag/takeout bag in hand leaving the restaurant. He never once told us he was leaving or said a word to us. Just left... The guy who took over was nice but clearly had not been updated on the tables. Again our previous waiter had supposedly put the rest of our order in and hadn't. Honestly with the service the way it was I'd give a normal restaurant 1 star... However I know the standards by which their other restaurant runs and I'm hoping this is just new restaurant issues that will be resolved. If I'm in the area I may stop in again for some small bites but will probably skip the ramen.",

It was an okay experience but nothing special definitely isn't a \"go to\" ramen place in my opinion, especially since you can't substitute the pork for anything other than more egg. My friend went ahead and got the ramen with double egg and the broth was good. It can also do without the fish cake, neither of us were a fan. I wanted sushi and choose the Boombastic per the suggestion of our server and it was really good. I also got a house salad to start because I love ginger dressing. And I ordered the pork belly Yakitori. The atmosphere was cool and very dimly lit. It's not very big but a good size. Our server was good at first with checking on us and offering suggestions but then got pretty slack.  When we go the check I noticed the price of my sushi roll was different and informed the server. He took the check back and walked away, coming back shortly just to inform me that I had an old menu, supposedly they were all mixed together. The prices online also reflect the price on the menu I had. He just said sorry about that but wouldn't change it or get the manger, I didn't have the energy to argue and was ready to leave & paid the couple dollar difference.",

The first time I came here, everything was spot on. The second time I came, my ramen was slightly salty. The Teriyaki Steak was kinda dry even though it was still pretty red. Could be the meat itself and not the sear though.   You've GOT to get those small dishes when you come, they're UHMAZINGGGG!! The grilled squid is phenomenal, takoyaki 10/10, etc... they are seasoned so well and melt in your mouth.",

We came on a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd, but not too busy inside. Our server was very friendly and attentive to our table and answered any questions we had. We started with the edamame and the gyoza, which arrived promptly to the table. Both were large enough portions to share, and very tasty. The gyoza seemed homemade and the filling was flavorful and the wrapping was light. I also ordered the tempura appetizer and my husband ordered the miso ramen. The tempura appetizer was more than enough food for me, with two of each type of vegetable and two shrimps. My husband loved his ramen and the way they give you the spices on the side so you can \"doctor\" it up how you like.   Can't wait to try some other menu items on our next visit.",

    "text": "As this is the second ~fancy, trendy~ ramen place that I have tried, I have shortly realized the complexity and variety of flavors and ingredients that a similar chicken-broth ramen (Shoyu or Shio) can have.  Before I get into that, Yama Izakaya has a great ambiance, a big space with lots of seating, has outdoor seating, and a parking lot with ample parking (which is a huge plus!). I went on a Sunday night and there was no wait at all. The wait staff is very friendly and quick and they have many options on their menu (ranging from various appetizers to sushi, to ramen, to general soups and salads).  I started my meal off with a simple ginger salad and it was AMAZING. I absolutely love ginger dressing and I am not exactly sure what secret extra ingredient or spice they added to theirs (some extra soy component), but it left me wanting much more! My friends decided to get miso soup and sushi, which both looked and tasted great!  For ramen, I ordered their Shio (salted chicken) ramen with no extra added on. Their broth was much lighter and less greasy than Futo Buta's which was a nice surprise (I would highly recommend adding the chili oil and red flakes to the broth, which adds an amazing depth of flavor). Similar to what other Yelp reviewers have said, they need to work on their noodles. They have a very similar taste and feel to a generic ramen $1 package at any grocery store, which made me realize how important noodles were to my ramen experience. Also, I wish they either added more ingredients to their bowl or changed out what they add on for better options (the toppings didn't really add much to the flavor). Also, their pork belly is sliced thin and has barely any fat on it which can either be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes and preferences.   After a lot of thought, in my opinion, it is very difficult to compare Futo Buta's and Yama Izakaya's ramen as they are both great but very different depending upon what you like/feel important is for your ramen experience. If you enjoy a lot of broth with your ramen that is light, a little on the salty side, and do not care too much about the noodles texture or toppings than I would 5/5 recommend Yama Izakaya for you as their broth will easily leave you satisfied! However, if you enjoy more heavy and earthy broth and care more about the thicker/soft noodles and included additional toppings, than I would head over to Futo Buta!",

The interior is dark, but pretty sexy with a bit of a lounge type feel. Our waitress came and seated The Lady and I immediately, and we perused the menu. We did get the Takoyaki, which is a fried dough with octopus (fun fact - Tako is Japanese for Octopus!). They were... they were different haha. But I enjoyed them! Piping hot and comes with bonito flakes which kinda squirm against the heat. It sounds weird, it looks weird, tastes pretty darn good.   For our dinners, we both stuck with Ramen because we had heard great things! I had the Tonkatsu Ramen, and The Lady got the Vegetable Udon Soup. Both were fantastic, and our waitresses recommendations and accommodations to keep things vegetarian for The Lady just made the whole experience better. My broth was, as many others have said, extremely flavorful and full of umami, and the noodles were perfect as well. I think The Lady enjoyed hers a lot, but I didn't have time to ask her before it was gone ;)  Anyways, it's hard to say if we'll be back here often, but it's a fantastic option that I'll highly recommend on my list of ramen places now.",

Yakitori was good so I want to try other menus next time but vegetable fries were not as good as I expected. Usually Japanese tempura is very crispy and thin fries but they are just okay. Takoyaki was okay and wish there were more tako(octopus) in it. Ramen was good, the broth was not as rich as I expected but it was good enough. If you want to try small Japanese tapas, this is good place to try.",

    "text": "We had a bit of a strange experience here for a late night dinner. The food was OK, the service a little spotty and the management helpful. My group of three walked in on a Saturday night and we were asked to wait in the lounge (aka the couches to the side) while they prepared a table for us. A little strange since there were several empty bussed tables throughout the dining area. I think the manager saw my dour look after we waited 15 minutes and had the host wipe down a table for us. Which obviously could have been wiped down 15 minutes earlier.  We split a round of edamame - which was delicious. Our drinks were originally sent to the wrong table but we were able to flag down the man with the drinks after the table next to us sent him away. My lychee martini was super strength but nicely cut with the sweetness of the lychee, 5 stars for my drink.  The waitress came back to let my sister know they were out of salmon (that seems like a pretty large flaw for a restaurant selling sushi, and to know only 20 or so minutes after we ordered). She said tuna was fine in its place and received her roll soon after. She finished her roll before the other two of us had any food or a check in from our waitress. We waited patiently sipping our martinis craning our neck for any sign of food from the kitchen for a while.   To his credit when the manager came around to ask how our meal was and found only 1/3 of us could answer he did whatever he needed to do, and offered us dessert on the house. The food came out almost immediately after. My tonkatsu ramen was lukewarm when it arrived and the flavor was bland. Maybe it had been sitting out a while but it wasn't the hot amazing broth I was craving on that frosty night.   I was on the fence between 2 stars for the experience or bumping it to 3 because of management's attentiveness. At the end of the day there's no reason for me to return and the feeling I left was \"meh\" so 2 stars it is.",

It's cool decor and lounge music set up the atmosphere for a perfect place to have dinner with a date, a group of people, or just sit alone at the bar.  Let's start with the drinks.  The Sake choices are pretty extensive and quite honestly, I don't know what most of them are...be sure to tell the bartender what you like so you can get a recommendation!  If you're not in a Sake mood, they have a full bar and a few wines by the glass.  If you're up for an app, please do yourself a favor and get the chicken wings.  They are actually dry on the outside (not the oily or greasy kind) and moist on the inside, so it's not your typical wing.  The beef negamaki is always a winner too.  Gyoza is pretty standard.  Entrees are a toss up.  They have teryaki chicken and steak...sauce is decent and the cook/temp on the food is always perfect.  But really, the winner at Yama is the Ramen.  I've had a few types and they just knock it out of the park.  Possibly the best Ramen in Charlotte.  The portions are fairly sizable.  Be prepared to take some of your meal home.  This place is never crowded.  Why?  I have no idea.  It's a great spot with great food.  I recommend Yama if you're in the mood for something different and you're in the Plaza area.",

From the shrimp dumplings and popcorn chicken to the cumin lamb skewers, shishito pepper skewers and bowl of ramen, all of the food tasted pretty good. An Izakaya is a pub like joint - and Yama is quite like that, except may be a tad bit more sophisticated than a pub. It's dimly lit, casual, somewhat noisy, the service is good and quick, quite a few food options and some good beer and sake choices (along with a full bar) on the menu. I don't think the food was necessarily authentic or unique by any means, but as pub food - it was good & nothing to complain about. A fair rating would be closer to 3.5 than 3. It's a fun new place worth checking out, especially with a group of friends on a Friday or Saturday evening.",

The bacon wrapped enoki is fabulous. The octopus balls were okay - the octopus was well cooked but the rest of the filling was too mushy for my taste. I got the udon with veggies and scarfed it down. Not sure what sauce was on it but it was really good.   Management was present during the most recent visit. A plate was dropped on the floor and the waitstaff missed one large shard during cleanup. The manager walked over and looked at that piece three times before a customer accidentally kicked it, picked it up, and handed it to the bartender. I'm sorry but that's just embarrassing.",

Everything was sooo bland that we figured they ran out of salt in the kitchen so they decided to serve everything with out salt...lol We stayed away for about 2 months and went back the other day to give it another try.  We ordered some yakitori and shio ramen and tonkotu ramen.  The food this time was much better ( I think they had salt this time ;)) The food is very average here ( I can probably make the yakitori much better at home..) The service is okay...kind of slow...

I was very excited to find out that this place was moving into the neighborhood after I read the menu from their other location.... Unfortunately, it has been a disappointment. :(  First of all, they don't serve sushi here (only at their other location).  Big mistake in this neighborhood.  We ordered the hamachi jalapeno, the chicken negi, a ramen bowl, bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, fried oysters, Gyoza, the buta kakuni, and a few cocktails.  The only thing worth ordering (and paying for!) is the hamachi jalapeno and the specialty ginger cocktail.  Everything else (each time we've visited) has been lackluster and a waste of money, especially compared to other competitive restaurants in the area.  After our 2nd bad experience here, we've decided not to go back. Why waste any more time or money? There are FAR better places to eat in close proximity.",

The Octopus Balls looked good, but I personally didn't enjoy the taste or texture. Squid legs were seasoned pretty well and were tasty. For my main entree, I ordered Chicken Katsu, its crispy fried dark meat, with a side of rice and some dipping sauce. Food was too dry for me to enjoy it. We finished off with some Mochi ice cream which was really satisfying. Willing to try this place again.",

Nothing was bad, but again, nothing was really good.  The waitstaff was really annoying, and we didn't really have just one waiter.  There was about 4 or 5 different people that constantly checked on our table, each bringing us/refilling our waters without asking.  Usually this is something I'm for, but at one point we had 12 glasses of water for 6 people at our table.  Instead of taking away the empty cups, the random waiters just continued to fill them.  This is also one of those places that doesn't write your order down, and they attempt to memorize everything.  Some places do it well, however this is not one of those places.  We had to remind our waitress a handful of times about missing items that she forgot to put in, and they brought us wrong food twice.",

We ordered takoyaki, okonomiyaki, gyoza, and ebi shumai. You can definitely share and make a meal out of the small plates. And that's what you would do at an izakaya in Japan.   Takoyaki and okonomiyaki both came drizzled with sauce, mayonnaise, and topped with bonito fish flakes. They were excellent! Takoyaki was nicely grilled on the outside but soft on the inside. Also very hot, so you know it's fresh. Okonomiyaki was tasty, but not as thick with tons of cabbage as I would like. Still, this is the only place in Charlotte that has it and it was good with crispy bacon on the bottom.   Gyoza were crispy on the bottom, and dumpling skins were tender without falling apart. My boyfriend didn't enjoy the ebi shumai as much but I think they were comparable to what I've had in Japan.    To cap it all off, the ladies room has a heated toilet seat with a washlet.   I will definitely be going back to try the ramen!",

    "text": "Ramen Background, I moved to Charlotte from San Francisco about a year ago. My wife and I went Ramen camping on Sundays in SF Bay area. The best Ramen shops would sell out as soon as the soup was gone. So you had to arrive 1 hour before opening and get on a 30 minute waiting list, hence Ramen Camping. SF bay area started our addiction for Ramen. We have had delicate seafood Ramen in Japan to this crazy Parmesan cheese spicy Ramen in Oahu HI. Anyways, my goal is to eat all the 26 distinct styled of Ramen in Japan.   So, back to moving to NC, the Asian Food SUCKS in Charlotte. BBQ is bomb here, but Asian food is to sweet for no reason and so Americanized?!?! Why, people here want the real deal. Yama, had real Ramen, the tonkatsu is really nice, great balance if Dashi and pork broth, huge slices of  chashu pork. Not the best I've had but it's a start for Charlotte. Keep it up Yama! Good stuff and please don't  listen to people who say your soup is not salty enough, they don't know Ramen.   Suggestion for Ramen, make your own Noddles, nothing wrong with dried noddles but fresh would set it off!! And, try new tonkatsu styles like black broth Kuro ramen from Mara Ichi in Mountain View CA, or spicy parmesan ramen from Agu Ramen in Oahu Hawaii. Your ramen price is also a bit high but i will still be back regularly",

We wanted to try the curry chicken but ended up getting the vegetarian option for this which was very basic. The gravy was good but definitely having meat would have enhanced it.",

Not once but a couple time this was how it was served. Last time, I opt for octopus. When I read the menu. It said wasabi and house dressing. We got very small cut up tentacles. There was no dressing or wasabi. It was just plain gross. We won't be going back or recommend this place. You should get what you pay for.",

    "text": "Not a great experience.  Overall the food, is good. The menu offers a wide range of options which is great for a bigger group.   We went in as a party of 7 for a birthday. Upon arrival it took a significant amount of time for a waitress to come to our table, please keep in mind there were plenty of empty tables - there were not slammed by any means.  Eventually a waitress came by and took our drink order. It took 15 minutes to receive these, one of which was forgotten. We reminded her and she seemed apologetic and eventually brought over the last beer.   We put in some appetizers to share which were good, but again, one of the items was forgotten. By the time we got it, our entrees were coming out.   ...this may come as a surprised, but one of our entrees didn't make it out. Our waitress dropped off everything and didn't come back for over 5 minutes where we, once again, reminded her of the forgotten entree. Again, she apologized and went to the kitchen to see what was happening. She came back and told us that she put the entree in just now, but because the kitchen is slammed it'll be a while before it comes out. So, she forgot to put it in originally, and now someone at our table is being told it'll be a long time before it comes out. She offered a cocktail to makeup for it, we declined.  At this time, I asked to speak to the manager. He seemed sincerely frazzled by the situation, especially when we mentioned we were there for a birthday. He ended up sending over a free dessert, served by our waitress who was literally crying. Please understand how uncomfortable it is to have your waitress, with tears running down her face, bringing items to your table. We can only assume she had been spoken to about the forgotten items? The manager ended up taking off a portion of the final bill which was really appreciated. It was a terrible experience, and it's a bummer because even with the food being good, the thought of returning is not inviting.",

To follow the law and be safe, we took an Uber home and returned the following morning to get our car.   Well what do you know, our car was gone.  We look around and see several people in the parking lot arguing with a guy they were paying to remove a boot, then I see boots all over the parking lot. These people had just been there and came out and there car was booted, and they were being forced to pay to remove it.   We ask the guy where our car was and he gave us a number. $250 later, we have our car back. They said we should have gotten a permit from the restaurant, but this was not obvious AT ALL. It is not typical to ask for a parking pass in a shopping center from your restaurant, and Yama Izakaya did not notify us or ask if we needed a parking pass.   This was a complete racket and scam, and the shopping center and Yama are part of it as the shopping center surely is getting a fat cut of our $250.  We will not be returning to Yama and will be warning all of our friends not to as well.",

My girlfriend and I have pretty high expectations when it comes to Japanese cuisine, but we were not disappointed in the slightest. We specifically came for the takoyaki (octopus balls) and were really surprised as to how great the texture on the inside was. We could tell that it was cooked correctly and thoroughly, because while it was crunchy on the outside, the inside melted like butter once you bit into the ball. The tuna tartare was also a pleasant surprise with the onions. Overall, our dinner was on point as well as the service. We found a parking spot right by the restaurant and were seated almost immediately when we walked through the doors. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!",

There's a couple places in Charlotte that seem to have above average Ramen, but Yama Izakaya has my vote.  First time getting Yama, my girlfriend got take out and brought it back to our apartment after a very long weekend. Ramen was what we needed. We both got different sushi and they were AWESOME. I've recently gotten into sushi so I'm still a little picky.  We got the Panther - spicy tuna, cucumber, kani, seared yellowtail, kimchi sauce, & tempura flakes + the Lake Norman - Shrimp tempura topped with seared tuna, scallion, masago, & eel sauce.  Both 5/5 would eat again. The Panther was super refreshing and the Lake Norman had quite the kick. Each came with some sort of seasoning on the side and plenty of soy sauce.  Now to the ramen. I got the spicy miso with extra pork and sweet corn. The broth and the pork here blows the broth and pork at Futo Buta out of the water and it's not even close. I liked everything about this ramen more except for maybe the noodles which were a lot more like you would see in a ramen noodle pack. Other than that, incredible.  I will be back here VERY soon and I can't wait.",

    "text": "The entire purpose of me selecting this restaurant to celebrate our friend's birthday, was to try the whole grilled squid, however, they were completely out of it. The heartbreak was real. As a result, I spent way too much extra time floundering about the menu, trying to find inspiration. Once I set my mind on a particular dish, I pretty much become insatiable until I get to enjoy it. Luckily, Yama Izakaya had other items that seemed super interesting. Here's what we ordered:  Salted Chicken Ramen-bland, bland, bland! Not good at all. I did request no Chasu as I don't allow pork on my fork, however, I requested that they replace it with salted chicken. What I got instead, was unseasoned fried chicken pieces that added absolutely nothing to the dish. I tasted the noodles and the texture was meh. I hate to say it, but the $.75 Top Ramen has 10 times more flavor than this did. It also didn't come out piping hot like ramen should, it was lukewarm at best. Overall I returned the dish due to the over simplicity of the broth and lack of depth of flavor, well the lack of flavor at all. Run.  Hamachi Kana-yellowtail cheek/jaw. This item looked beautiful and was super meaty, but was also dry. I think that was due to the natural consistency of yellowtail when it is cooked, because the execution was done well. I would have enjoyed more flavor/glaze that could have compensated for the dryness of the fish.  Grilled Kano-perfectly cooked duck breast. Delicious.  Baked New Zealand Mussels-decent flavor, but would have been better if it came out hot.    Hibachi Fried Rice-sushi rice is used, this was just ok.   Out of pure curiosity, I'll potentially give it another try.",

Fully stocked bar with lots of sake, cocktails and beer--plus a couple of wine choices.Bartenders were attentive and asked for our feedback on the cocktails. We sampled a couple of the pass-around food as well as ordered from the menu. Everything we had was tasty--edamame, yellowtail with jalapenos, bacon wrapped asparagus, mushrooms, grilled steak and the dumplings. I also ventured out and tried the monkfish liver and pickled octopus-- interestingly tasty . This is a great addition to the Plaza Midwood area. Stop in and enjoy the authenticity that the owner and his wife have brought to Charlotte. I look forward to coming back and trying the ramen and other tapas dishes.",

I had searched for Ramen in Charlotte more than a year ago, and having not found any, had not searched again until now.  I was excited to find Yama Izakaya.  After eating tasty Ramen in larger cities, and many times in Asia, my expectations were not very high for Yama.  Was I ever wrong!  I ordered the Tonkusto and was blown away by its flavor!  Yama is on par with any other US Ramen house if not better.    While the price is more expensive than other places I have eaten, it is worth every penny.  The serving is large.  Ramen is served in a deeper bowl than usual, with more than enough noodles to fill you up.  I look forward to trying other menu items, but the Tonkusto is enough to keep me coming back over and over.  Restaurant is clean, trendy, and wait staff is friendly and attentive.",

I get this appetizer pretty consistently at every Japanese restaurant, and for me, the Ika was cooked properly, very tasty in fact. That immediately got Yaka a 4 star! What pushed it to 5 was the pork bone broth! The ramen was delicious delicious. A very filling lunch at 6 after not having my lunch at 2 p.m.  Also use the bathroom after, they've installed a Japanese style toilet which in my opinion every household should have!",

We had a vegan and a gluten free member in our party and we were struggling to find something for either of them to eat. The server was knowledgable and helped us guide through the menu you be something that both could eat. However their experience was not that great.  I had the teriyaki chicken which was not bad and the shiitake mushrooms which are 3 skewers of 3 mushrooms each lightly toasted and then a dab of sauce on them. Not entirely worth it.   All in all its a good concept (tapas style Japanese) but for me it fell a little short on the options that we could eat.",

I've been to many places in Charlotte that serve Japanese food with a variety of local craft brews, but this is the first place that seems to be aiming for a truly authentic Japanese experience.  They have over ten styles of Japanese beers, Asian-influenced cocktails (Gin and Gingertini, YUM!), and the largest sake list I've seen.  Our server was very helpful in walking us through the sake list, and recommended a delicious, dry sake that tasted miles beyond the sake I've had before.  In addition, the Miso ramen minus the fish cake/egg was delicious, and also vegan.  Wakame salad made an excellent starter.  The restaurant is hip and traditional combined, the staff are happy, and the owners walk through the dining room to personally speak with you.  I can see how Yama Asian Fusion is as successful as it is!    Vegans and vegetarians can find some food options after some tweaking, and that ramen was SO very good.  I will probably find myself here after work quite often, lol.",

It was disappointing to receive the ramen with the seaweed already absorbed in the soup. It would have been better if the meats were presented on top of the broth not already mixed in and with the seaweed being dry.  The pork belly was advertised as a thin slice of fat with a larger portion of meat, but hat was not the case. The skewer was mainly chewy fat with minimal amounts of meats. Also, I was expecting it to be more grilled.",

The tapas-style setting is great for groups willing to share a taste of dishes.  Be warned that the small plates are in fact \"petite portions\" and they do skew a tad pricey, ranging from $6-12 per dish.  I can't say it's The Best, but the food is consistent and the menu definitely exceeds you're typical \"hibachi\" joint.  My favorites were the Spicy Beef (marinated beef), Ebi Shumai (shrimp dumpling), and Okonomiyaki (pancake).  Overall it was a good experience and I'll certainly be going back for the Ramen!",

When we inquired about gluten-free options, we were informed YI does not have any, and we were told this isn't an oversight, but rather the owner is anti-gluten-free. Meaning, he is one of those people who doesn't believe Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities are actually a \"thing\". Not a great start...  Most of the group ordered noodle soup dishes and thought they were fine, but not good enough to patronize the establishment again. One of the group, the GF member, ordered teriyaki chicken, even though they knew it wasn't GF, but it was the best we could do... The chicken pieces were HORRIBLE, chewy, rubbery and gristly, and worse than you would expect from the cheapest, greasiest Chinese take-out place.   To be clear, YI doesn't even offer a GF noodle option, much less GF soy sauce. Rice noodles would be such an easy option for a restaurant such as YI to offer, but first the owner would have to care about GF guests.   Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

My friend was seated and waiting on me.  It was fairly busy for a Monday night..  We noticed nice brick work on the walls.  There are thick ropes that serve as dividers between tables that had a nautical feel.  Alternative rock music played in the background.  So pleased that it was not cheesy pop! Because I checked in on Yelp, we were rewarded with free edamame!  We also ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetables as a starter.  The serving was small, and the tempura seemed less crisp than what I have experienced, but it tasted fine. For my entree, I ordered the vegetables and buckwheat noodles.  My friend ordered the same with shrimp.  And, of course I asked for hot sauce.  A small saucer arrived, and because I only had chopsticks, there was difficulty scraping out the remaining sauce.  So, I asked for another saucer of hot sauce.  Yes, I know.  I have a problem. The entree itself was good, but there was nothing that was particularly outstanding about it.  The ladies' bathroom handle had problems.  Someone had to open the door from the other side so that I could escape. This is a newer restaurant, and I think that with time, it will evolve into an established venue.",

    "text": "My friends heard about this place that just opened up not too long ago and we decided to come try it out. I was a little hesitant because this is the same owners from Yama Asian Fusion in Southpark (I went there once for dinner and was NOT impressed at all). But I figured hey, I'll give this place at least one chance.  For small bites/yakitori, we ordered: Ika Sugatayaki (Grilled squid), Seared Tuna Salad (my favorite), Hamachi Jalapenos, Akimo (Monkfish liver), Ika Geso (fried squid tentacles), Takoyaki (fried octopus ball), and Chicken Negi (chicken on skewers). The small bites and yakitori were all pretty good and tasty. So far, so good.  For my main dish, I ordered the Tonkostu Ramen (pork bone broth) and I'm sad to say that it was only average at best. The portion was a good size but it was SO VERY BLAND tasting and kind of lacking. There's a lot of ramen and broth, but not very much of everything else. Their ramen leaves a lot to be desired to simply put it. I've had packaged ramen that had more flavor than the ramen I had here and I'm not even being facetious, that's pretty disappointing.  Service is on point, and the servers pay attention and take care of you. I'd come back to hang out with friends and to eat the small bites/yakitori but I probably won't be ordering a ramen bowl again. You won't find another restaurant in Charlotte that serves the small bites/yakitori they have, so they have that going for them but this place is average at best.",

I had the wasabi tako, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and tonkotsu ramen. The takoyaki was the best out of all the selections and it was piping hot when it came out. The wasabi tako was good but I would have liked more sliced scallions on top. Okonomiyaki (pancake) was a bit small for the price ($12) but it tasted great. In terms of the ramen, yeah the bowl is somewhat large, but for $14, it was seriously lacking. The broth was tasty and the noodles seemed fresh. Even the amount of chashu was typical (2 slices).  BUT I've been to better ramen bars with more toppings (nori, scallions, naruto, etc) and better made chashu for $10-11. Also, \"shio\" ramen actually refers to \"salt,\" not chicken as mentioned on their menu. Call me a ramen snob, but whatevs.  I also had Orion and Hana Awaka Sake. I recommend the Hana Awaka if you like the sweeter side of things. I wanted the Fukucho but they ran out (on their opening weekend? what tha....).  So bar food - delicious, ramen - left to be desired, drinks - good selection, service - good. A bit more westernized than I would have liked but they do have the hi-tech Japanese toilet that spits out water.",

Probably the best ramen you'd find in Charlotte, but nowhere near the best ramen I've had in my life. Heck, not even in the top 5. It lacks that extra something special, that indescribable quality that would make it craveable. It's not particularly flavorful, which makes me think that their claims of cooking the pork belly all day were a bit of an exaggeration. There was nothing spicy on the table, the meat in the ramen was tough and overcooked, and the egg in the broth was basically just a hard-boiled let down. A soft boiled egg in super hot broth would be way better.   The izakaya wasn't much better. The waiter pointed out a number of dishes that were \"favorites,\" but nothing stood out as a signature dish.   The portions were good. The parking lot is spacious, but the location is WEIRD -- it's two doors down from a Family Dollar. What?  Worst part of the dinner was service. The waiter wasn't attentive or any good at remembering our orders. He couldn't tell us apart and totally botched the (uncomplicated, totally expected) bill payment situation.   I can't see myself going back to YI unless a friend decides to host a birthday party there. There's better food to be had in Charlotte and I only have so many days and dollars to spend in this life so I won't waste any on blah food if I can help it. But the food isn't terrible so if it's convenient for you and you just have a jonesin for some standard, Americanized pan-Asian fare, this isn't a bad bet.",

Even the atmosphere and decor WINS  love love love it  Can't wait to return and introduce this gem to some friends. Worth it in so many ways.",

They can have multiple tables vacant and tell you there's a wait with the whole restaurant half empty. It's amazing that the manager and the bartender never smile or make you feel welcome . Strange atmosphere , but great food.",

    "text": "Not your typical Japanese restaurant...  Since this is a japanese restaurant that doesn't serve mainly sushi and hibachi there are  menu items that are pretty unfamiliar to a lot of people, but there are still lots of options that aren't as exotic. You can be pretty adventurous or go pretty plain and have a delicious meal either way.   I tend to enjoy the more exotic side of the menu and stay away from things like gyoza, edamame, yellowtail with jalapeno and ponzu, tempura, tori kara-age - fried popcorn chicken etc. (although, I have tried those dishes with friends and they are done pretty well)  What I really enjoy are dishes like their Ika Geso - a generous helping of fried squid legs served with a lemon slice, ankimo - monkfish liver steamed and served cold with ponzu and salmon roe (I would love to see an iteration of this dish with truffle, even if it has to be truffle oil for cost reasons), okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and the yakitori is really nice - I like when they do offal.   I have also had the ramen on several occasions, and it's pretty good. It is not the best I have had, but it is the best I have had in Charlotte.  Considering that this place is called Izakaya, I'm slightly disappointed at the lack of focus on the drinks. Izakaya is supposed to have a after-work happy hour feel - everyone goes to drink and food happens - Yama Izakaya feels a lot more like a restaurant. Beer specials and happy hour food specials could go a long way.",

Afterwards it was super bland and tasteless. At least work on the presentation of the ramen bowl if your flavoring is bland!  Service as good though. We had a homeless guy came wandering in the restaurant and was bugging us during our dinner.

The broth was not very distinct, there was a generous potion of pork and noodles in the bowl along with the included toppings. My significant other ordered the chicken teriyaki; he said there was plenty of meat to go around. A solid teriyaki dish, just nothing to write home about. At the prices they charge, you are given a fair amount of food but it was a bit much for us.",

I asked the bartender for a plate of edamame to start since I \"supposed I needed some vegetables.\" Bartender then suggests I order the shishito peppers. I asked how hot they are and he replied that maybe one in ten have some heat but they're very flavorable. So, being in an adventurous mood I agreed. A few minutes passed and the bartender brought the plate of peppers. The food was moving. Surely my eyes are playing tricks on me! So I quickly turned on my flashlight. The food was in fact moving. I am not a Klingon so this disturbed me in a fundamental way and so I quickly summoned the bartender. \"It's moving.\" He held up his hands - smiling - and said \"no, no! I promise you it's not alive!\" Turns out, the peppers are cooked in oil, sprinkled with sea salt and then topped with shaved, dried fish flakes. The fish flakes react to the hot oil and literally move. After the initial shock of moving food, I did muster up the courage to try a pepper and thought it was really good! The peppers had lots of flavor, saltiness, slight fish flavor - not overwhelming. I will order them again - hopefully when I'm with an unsuspecting companion.... Oh, and by the way, I did come across the \"one in ten\" hot peppers - hot but not killer.  Yama Izakaya has a very limited wine offering but the Chardonnay I ordered was fine. They are more of a sake and beer place anyway. I ordered the cumin lamb skewers which I felt were somewhat over cumin-ed which took away from the flavor of the lamb. The third dish I had were the fried dumplings stuffed with chicken and pork. They were my favorite.  I will definitely return to try other items on their menu especially the ramen bowls.",

    "text": "Last night, a group of friends and I went out for my birthday dinner at Yama Izakaya.  The food was alright, but definitely wasn't worth $15; however, for the occasion, it was worth it.  I got the Tonkatsu, which was good, but the noodles were underdone and the broth was a little plain for my taste, but luckily there was additives that could be added.  However, the worst part of the whole night is the ridiculous service that we received.  When we sat down, the waitress failed to mention to us that she could not split checks... which is fine because I figured it was like every other place that split check that someone would just pick up another person and so on and so forth.  However, this was NOT the case.  Instead, they really meant they could not itemize the checks, so instead of letting people pay for what they wanted... they totaled everything (alcohol included) that everyone bought and split the check by the number of people there.  Are you freaking kidding me?  I wound understand this... if this place was a family eating environment, but why should I have to pay for someone's drink or food, if my food really only cost $8.  However, according to their \"policy\", they were going to charge everyone $25 each. Heck, we had people underage there, so why should they even have to pay for alcohol... if they can't even buy alcohol?  That point, should they even have a liquor license for selling alcohol to minors?  First, I tried to speak to the waitress about the situation, but she was not helpful at all.  She tried to tell me that she explained the policy, but I assured her that she did not; otherwise, I would of sat down and gone somewhere else.  Then, I later asked for some items and she rolled her eyes.  Very professional.  So, I kindly go up to the manager and try to discuss the matter.  However, our kind conversation didn't stay kind because the manager was rude, incompetent, and down right unhelpful.  He goes to note in a condescending tone that I and my friends have been there before and they've always had this policy... but, I explained to him that was not the case because if I knew the policy that I would have not chosen the place for my birthday dinner because it's an inconvenience.  Going forward, I know now that this place is completely disrespectful and their \"split itemization policy\" is for their benefit, so they don't have to work.  So, if you're looking for over price, over salted food with a side of unhelpful, rude, and disrespectful service.. then Yama Izakaya is the place to go!  However, if you're smart... avoid at all cost.",

    "text": "I have passed this place a few times and didn't realize it was part of the other Yama (amazing) restaurant in South Park. It has this sort of cheesy overly large light up sign in a semi-run down shopping center. That said, I love Bistro LaBon which is right next door. Moving on, I ordered a couple of appetizers (grilled whole squid and steak skewers (needed more seasoning)) which were more in the 3 * range. I wasn't up for a big carb load and didn't order the ramen or soba --  -- but this is what you SHOULD order here. Had a bite of the stir fried soba noodles + veggies entree and it was good. Bottom line - YI has a somewhat limited menu but interesting options. You really should be in the mood for Ramen and why I am rounding up to 4 (and will re-review then).  This place has a few sushi rolls to order (like 4) and several really nice ramen/soba/stir fry dishes. It also has lots of small plates and crafty cocktails (which is more of the theme). I would like to go back to this place and hang out again. I really liked the decor and was pleasantly surprised overall.",

A lot to love here -from the decor, well-mixed drinks, fresh fish and RAMEN. Charlotte had a gaping bowl shaped hole and Yama Izakaya is here to fill that chasm with their ramen.  Is it the best I've ever had? Of course not. Is it dang good? Yup.  I split a bowl with a friend and the pork was so lovely.  Also tried the yellow tail collar (yum, pricey but so unlike anything you've recently eaten), Hamachi with jalapeno (uhuh, super fresh and well balanced) and the lamb lollipops (my only disappointment. $12 for two small pops).  Make your reservations now because this place is going to be like Soul was four years ago.",

I really enjoyed the wings and ramen was done really well.  We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks. I can't remember the drink I had but it was really good and citrus. The bartender was really nice and help with choosing drink options.  I say you should go by and check them out. You will not be disappointed.",

The service was good, our server checked up on us often and the manager came to our table to see what he could do to improve our experience. The ambiance was nice too, it had a modern trendy tapas bar twist to it. Yama Izakaya is also in an interesting location, a small plaza next to a health food store and family dollar. Very easy to miss.   That was all that I could say was good about Yama Izakaya. When we first arrived we were able to use the yelp checkin for a free edamame which was ok, the edmame was fresh and crisp but there was no seasonings to add anywhere in sight. I didn't even see a soy sauce bottle the entire time I was here..  I ordered the shoyu ramen while my bf ordered the chicken ramen. It didn't take long for our dishes to come out. We were pretty bummed about the size since we payed $13 per bowl...was not as big as it should have been. Both bowls of ramen were also terribly bland, seriously it didn't seem like they added any salt or seasonings at all. The ramen noodles themselves were very stale and overcooked, they tasted like instant ramen noodles that were just on the stove too long. It just wasn't appealing to us. I did however, appreciate the amount of vegetables in my ramen.   We weren't impressed enough to come back, hopefully they make some improvements soon.",

    "text": "I was really excited when I heard there was a new ramen place in town, but I guess I had too high of expectations for this place.  When I first arrived, I thought that the atmosphere was really great and the decorations were pretty awesome.  I sat at a table where there were ropes hanging from the ceiling to the bottom separating us from the other table.  I thought it was pretty cool.  The lighting in there was dim, so it felt like a great intimate place for a date, or just a small group of friends.  The ramen was what I was excited about, but the their Small Bites were what was amazing to me.  Definitely try the Ika Geso (fried squid tenticles), Takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and Hamachi Jalapenos.  The Tuna Salad is pretty wicked as well!  If you go there, TRY THE SMALL BITES!!!  Now as for their ramen, it's a different story.  I had ordered the Tonkostu Ramen and asked for it to be spicy.  I did not taste any spiciness in it or did I really taste any flavor as it was very bland.  It really made me sad that it was bland.  I have since come back since my first time and I feel that the place is stepping up their game.  It seems that the Tonkatsu Ramen is getting more flavorful.  The service here is really nice.  I quite enjoyed our waiter as he was friendly and very patient to explain things when we weren't sure what it was that we were ordering or wanted more of an explanation.",

    "text": "Again by pluck & happenstance I've stumbled into a soft open and have been richly rewarded. This smaller, hipper edition of Yama will be for those in search of bold & experimental flavors. Do not come here for California rolls & Sapporo. Think quail egg, monkfish liver (the seafood equivalent of foie gras), and a wasabi raw octopus dish that's sublime in balancing flavor versus texture.  The decor is contemporary with elements of traditionalism. There are a few booths along the wall neatly separated by hanging thick strands of rope, primarily seating is tables with comfortable chairs at the bar meant for holding the human body for dining. It is not your typical Japanese restaurant in a strip shopping mall.  Like the food the bar has a focus of uniqueness and being different than surrounding offerings. Saki will be a strong point.  Food is split between small plates (where vegetarian choices are limited), yakitori, and entrees where ramen is featured. Depending on the small plate ordered you'll get 3-6 items so sharing is the goal. The pork belly is so good you may not want to. On a stick items come in 3s. Ramen lovers may no longer need to commute to Pineville as the broths are made each night for the next day and the deepness of flavor shows. The serving size is generous, so commit to 2-3 small plates or ramen. You'll be too full for all. Later look for a number of specials to capitalize on unique ingredients or the chef's creativity.  Prices are are reflective of the higher quality ingredients but not outrageously so. It's a step up in experience for the neighborhood but you won't feel it was overpriced.",

    "text": "Someone pinch me!  I think I'm dreaming. The RAMEN here is out of this world amazing.  We came here by searching on Yelp for Japanese food only to discover they had just opened and we hit the jackpot. Yes, that's right, Grand Opening Night!  They had a complementary photo booth, free food samples and the only thing you had to pay for was your drinks.  I will have to say, I ordered the full size portion of the chicken broth ramen and it was fantastic.  The broth was seasoned to perfection and the noodles were also cooked to perfection (not overly cooked and not crunchy). I will have to say, I tried the Cucumber Saketini and it was not the best drink I've ever had.  It was a bit watered down in flavor and weak on the alcohol.  All of their cocktails are homemade on location, so I would suggest they perfect this drink a bit more before allowing it into the masses.  I digress...  They brought us a few skewers of shiitake mushrooms that were very tiny but full of flavor.  I'd like to see larger sized mushrooms, but they were fantastic nevertheless.  We were also given a few skewered peppers that were flavorful as well. I believe they are going to be really big, really quick!  They just need to get on Open Table to make it easier to make reservations.    The decor is dark and authentic feeling.  The ropes they have hanging between tables along the walls add a nautical feeling and I love it. The waitstaff are very friendly and accommodating.  Abraham was our waiter and he was certainly top notch.  This is definitely a go to place for a nice weekend treat!",

Such a mistake.  My experience was even less impressive this time around, and I think I can safely this is my least favorite restaurant in Charlotte based on a satisfaction to price ratio.  I didn't give it a 1-star rating because nothing out of the ordinary or egregious happened, nor did I get food poisoning... but, I just do NOT like this place.  Overpriced? check. Mediocre food? check. Ridiculously small portions? check. Incompetent service? check (but not for lack of effort, to be fair). Overpriced? check, check.  I say this twice because I cannot reiterate how small the plates are, and how unsatisfying everything was.  This time around, BF and I shared: monkfish liver, pork belly buns, tonkatsu ramen, and chicken katsu.  Everything was bad -- too salty, too fishy, too sweet, too bland, too mushy -- you name it, whatever the dish was supposed to be, it wasn't.  I'm getting mad all over again thinking about how much money I spent on that meal, and how little pleasure I derived from it.  NEVER AGAIN.  And this time, I mean it.",

    "text": "We stopped by this restaurant when we were visiting Charlotte for a CHVRCHES concert.  My partner stumbled on this restaurant while looking for katsu curry (one of our favorite Japanese dishes, but soooo hard to find in NC).  We were really excited, but were sadly disappointed to find that it was no longer on the menu :(  Nevertheless, having tried amazing Izakaya-style food in New York, we were still quite eager to see how this establishment in Charlotte matched up.  It was a pleasant experience overall.  I'll start with the meh:  pork belly buns were alright, nothing to sing home about.  The grilled whole octopus was not very good...it was a little rubbery and dry.  However.... the Japanese pancake was absolutely delicious.  It was chockful of veggies and bacon, and was topped with a generous helping of bonito flakes.  My partner had never tried a Japanese-style pancake before and really enjoyed it.  The star of the day was really the Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) Ramen, though.  The broth was extremely flavorful-- probably the best bone broth I have ever tasted.  Our waitress told us that they boil their broth overnight, which probably explains the hearty flavor.  Noodles were springy and there was a healthy serving of pork slices with the Ramen.  We especially liked that they did away with seaweed so there wasn't an overly fishy/earthy flavor to the broth.  Next time we're in town...we're definitely stopping by for the Ramen!",

    "text": "They just opened.  I mean JUST opened the doors.  There isn't even a sign yet.  I think the actual grand opening is next week.  Nice decor, friendly service, and good ramen.  The booths have large pieces of rope in between them.  It gives a barrier, but yet doesn't make you feel confined.  Our server was very friendly and extremely attentive.  That said, he needs some practice with his spiel.  The descriptions of some things were extremely vague, and others just seemed more like rambles and no real point ever made.  That will all come with time, and I knew what I wanted anyhow.  As far as the food goes.  I assumed it was just a ramen bar before entering.  Only to find out later it was a Japanese style tapas bar that served ramen as well.  I really enjoyed my noodles.  It wasn't like the quality you would hope to expect in a major city like NY, San Fran, or D.C., but a nice addition to the Charlotte food scene.  With so many pho places in the area, its nice to have another option.  As per the tapas.  The small bites were pretty small bites, and not cheap either.  I wouldn't say over-priced for the area, especially at $12-13 for a huge bowl of ramen.  But at 6-12'ish plus a pop for small bites and similar prices for yakitori, it can add up fast.  Some of these little bites may be amazing and totally worth it, I'll have to try again.  However, personally, I'd rather be full for $12, than still hungry after spending $20.  For you drinkers, the bar is fully stocked.  Plenty of sake and a few beers on tap.  Bottom line is that this place has some potential.  I think local foodies will give it a chance as well as the plaza midwood scene.  I'm glad their doing a soft opening for now as they were out of a lot of things, and the staff is still wet behind the ears.  All that should get fixed ASAP.  I'll be back!",

I must say it was the best ramen I've ever had. It wasn't super salty like the regular pork ramen. I tried my boyfriend's pork broth and I'm glad I didn't get it. It was salty like all the other ramen places. We also got the octopus balls and the squid. Octopus balls had good flavor but it was really really soggy. The squid was a little too fishy for me.  The appetizers does not affect my rating though.  The reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because the service was severally lacking. There were over 4 waitresses and waiters and it was NOT busy at all (3 other tables and two tables outside). Somehow I could never find my waitress and noone else came to check on us all though they were standing on the back of the wall just chit chatting. It took forever to get my waitress to come take our order. The food arrived quickly but after that she was gone again. I needed more water and she was no where to be seen. We finished our food completely and looked for our waitress to ask for the check. After that long wait, we had to wait some more for her to print out the check. I laid down my credit card and she took it and went MIA again. We waited and waited for our receipt to sign. There was noone at the register. She just took my card and left it at the register. I know they know we were getting impatient. Can't miss how my hair whips each time I look for our waitress. It takes longer to get out of here than to order and eat our food. This place has good ramen but only come here if you have more than 2 hours to spare.",
