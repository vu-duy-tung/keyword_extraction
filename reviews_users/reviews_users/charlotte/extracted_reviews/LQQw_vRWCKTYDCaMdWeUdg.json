Then called to ask about to go order and a girl named Jasmine (attitude problem) was not helpful at all about a request to have chicken tenders cut in pieces and done in the spicy chicken sauce. Said it was to much work for cook to cut up!! Apparently she's never cut a chicken strip. I enjoy Longhorns across the country but will never go to this one.",

    "text": "Food was good. Service was extremely slow. My friend and I arrived at 5:40 with our children. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. We waited 5-10 minutes before a server came to our table to take our drink order. The server that took our drink order informed us that our server was very busy and he was helping him out. We also gave an appetizer order to this server when he returned with our drinks. At 6:15 our appetizer finally arrived and was delivered by our actual server (who didn't even bother to introduce himself or apologize for not being at our table earlier). We ordered our food and it was delivered by another server. Our server eventually checked in to see how our food was. The manager checked in with our table and we mistakenly said everything was fine (giving our server the benefit of the doubt that he was busy). We finished our meals and wait at least 10 minutes before flagging down another server for a box and our check. Our server finally showed up and gave us our check. We requested a coupon be taken off the check and our checks split - th is process seemed to take awhile. Finally we had our checks and we're ready to pay, suddenly our server was right on top of things ready to accept our payment (at this point the restaurant was actually busy).  Asked to see the manager on the way out to share our experience.  Began my conversation wi th him by saying \"I really should have said some thing to you earlier when you stopped by our table\".  He half apologized, made a point to say \"you should have said something earlier) and said he would talk to the server.  Overall I was very disappointed in the service and the managers response.",

My sister had the prime rib, medium rare and it looked delicious.  She ate it all and was quiet all through dinner, so it must have been good otherwise she would have been a lot more \"chatty.\"  My cousin's steak was ordered medium but was a little too rare for her.  Our server, Carly, was very friendly and a great waitress.  The service was quick and our drinks (Sangria and a margarita) were very tasty.  The atmosphere was pleasant and you can actually have a conversation without yelling.   I can't wait to go back and try the prime rib!",

We went in and it was suprisingly crowded for a Sunday.  We sat at the bar and our bartender Jasmine was so welcoming and sweet!  We started with the appetizer sampler and it came with stuffed shrooms, chicken roll up things, and fried shrimp.  It was all delicious but I think the mushrooms were my favorite!  We then moved to the wedge salad, which is delicioussss!  Their blue cheese is home made and you can tell a huge difference!    Their steaks are delicious and seasoned wonderfully.  I also had a nice glass of cab with dinner (and extra 2 dollars and you can get 3 more ounces!)  Overall it was a wonderful dinner and Jasmine enhanced our whole experience.  With her adorable southern accent and her professional attitude while dealing with a....difficult customer...A really great steakhouse option that is close by and really making a splash in the Matthews area.",

Hits - pleasant bartender  Misses: - poorly staffed bar, took too long to get a GOW (glass of wine) or the bartender's attention.  - I ordered the 11oz ribeye--medium, rice and green beans.  The steak was ver well done, no pink, I'm still chewing a piece right now, it was awful. The rice was the best thing on the plate and green bean came on a separate sauce plate--they didn't leave them in the microwave oven long enough. They were cold and awful.

    "text": "Our experience here was mediocre.  The food was okay and the service was lacking.  There seems to be a disconnect between the servers and the runners of the food.    We had a party of 4 and each of us ordered.  A different person (not our server) brought out our food and interrupted our conversation to ask everyone what they had ordered while holding the plates.  I can't stand that!  As we fumbled to remember what we each ordered, he handed my husband his plate.  He had ordered a flank steak but got a sirloin.  The server insisted it was flank steak.  My husband used to be a chef, it was not flank steak!    I ordered my filet rare and it came out medium.  I was going to send it back but decided to just eat it rather than wait for another steak.  After the meal most of our dirty dishes were collected, but not all of them.  After getting tired of staring at the remaining dirty dishes we put them on the empty table next to us.   We had to flag down the server for dessert and coffee.  As we were waiting for our dessert and coffee, another server (a runner) tried to deliver us 2 dinner plates!  Couldn't he see that we were a party of 4, not 2 and that we were done eating?!    The management needs to ensure the runners know what tables they are delivering food to and what each guest is having.  We won't be back, Texas Roadhouse is MUCH better and less expensive.",

Hakim was awesome! He provided great, friendly, and attentive service. I told him about my horrible experience at the Tilted Kilt across the way of waiting over 10 minutes of never being acknowledged or waited on at the bar. I was only going to have a small order of wings there, but thanks to Hakim's hospitality I went all in on a big juicy steak.   My ribeye was cooked perfectly and tasted great. I had a couple of special requests with my salad and he was extremely accommodating.   A big Thank You and job well done to Hakim and Longhorn!",

    "text": "My best friend and I went there as part of my birthday celebration. It was our first time and the LAST time we will ever go there. First of all we went to the bar to order cocktails received the worst service ever. We had to wait forever because the server was busy talking. When she came she was not friendly at all.  The area at the  bar we were sitting at needed to be cleaned off. When she came she took the dishware and utensils. Took our order  but didn't wipe the area off and left two used  straws there. So we WAITED on our cocktails. Finally when we got our drinks I asked if she would wipe the area off because there was a sticky substance on it. The server gave me a funny look and said sure.  So she gave us our drinks but didn't give us napkins. Which you usually get when you order comes you get napkins. But we didn't. So I got the  server's attention and asked if she could bring us napkins. When I asked for the napkins I got the impression that I was agitating  the server based upon  the look and tone that I received from her. So as we waited for the napkins our buzzer went off. It took so long for us to get the napkins that the seater came looking for us. So I left and my friend stayed to  pay our tab. Which it took her forever to do. While she was there she the server gave her an attitude because she asked for her change back and then goes on to say how much our tab was because she  assumed that just because we got our cocktails that she was getting a tip. So when she brings  the change she  throws it down in my friends hand. Now, I don't know about anyone else but to me you don't get a tip for doing your job. You get a tip based upon the level of customer service you provide. And if you are deserving you will at least get the minimum. And if it's good I will tip extra.  And if you are rude you will get 0. So when we finally our table we asked to see the manager because that tip issue was the last straw. Management made it seem like she was sooooo sorry and that she  was gonna  take care of us when we got our bill. Needless to say nothing was taken off. But I  wasn't suprised. The service from our table server  was excellent and I tipped him based around the  level of  customer service I received so it was extra.    Clearly there is an issue with the bar service because I read a previous review regarding the bar servers. I will not go back to dine there.",

Well I went to long horn and ordered the ribs at first they were ok, then I realized they were too charred to the point where you couldn't taste the meat unless you put something else in your mouth to get rid of the taste.  Now I'm not a rib expert but I know I don't like the burnt taste I experienced today it was gross.  I guess I should just stick to my other place and not try to adventure out any more.  And it also was laced with fat, yeah yeah I know things being cooked with fat is a wonderful thing but being presented with it is nasty.  Getting a fork full of fat is gross.

    "text": "I haven't eaten at one of these in years and generally avoid them for more local fare. But a $50 gift card changed all that tonight. I was worried because of the negative reviews, especially for the service. But - in a nutshell- we had a really good experience. Our server was prompt, nice, and considerate. The place was a bit busy but not overly loud. We got house salads first with our bread. Nothing crazy but tasty. Bread was good but not as good as others' (like Outback). I got a 8 oz Sirloin and broccoli. The broccoli had a nice, bit spicy sauce to it. The steak was really tasty and perfectly cooked. Wife had salmon and she said it was very good. Last, but not least, my kids got chicken fingers - which came with orange slices and fries. Fries were okay but the tenders were clearly hand-breaded and my kids loved them. Best of all - price was great for how much food we got. Overall - really good experience. Thanks Longhorn!",

Order stuffed mushrooms when they come I eat one but the second one I picked up  I find a piece of hair wrapped in the mushroom  . Literally baked into the mushroom . Manger comes over  she was nice but tried to say it's because they're peeling the corn back there in the kitchen now , that it was probably corn hair that we found . Had to correct her and let her no it was Hair . She said she would take half of on our bill .  Then ask what I was drinking . I let her know a soda . She said she would get me a refill . 6 min go by still don't have one . Ask the waiter if I can get a refill ? He never comes back with one . My fiance had to go up to the bar and ask for one his self . Because we were waiting So long . Place wasn't even that busy .   When our waiter brought out the food I ask for more sour cream for my Bake potato. Waiter never came. Back until  it was time to go and he's like oh I forgot something does she still want that . Slowest place ever . I wouldn't recommend going here unless you want human hair in your food .",

    "text": "Greeted warmly as we walked in. For a Friday night after 7pm, we were shocked to be seated immediately!  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Although she did not know if an e-coupon we had would work.   We ordered an appetizer (firecracker chicken wraps) with our meal because things seemed to be moving ever so slowly! The appetizer was rather tasty but things went downhill from that point.  It took FOREVER for our food to arrive and the restaurant was rather empty, particularly in our section.  When it did, our younger son's kid's meal was the best looking plate! I specifically asked for a medium well burger to have a warm pink center. It was charred and very well done. Our older son's burger from the kid's menu looked the same. Perhaps most disappointing was that my husband ordered a steak with a baked sweet potato as his side. The steak arrived without it; he had to eat french fries with a steak. The server seemed offended when my husband said \"nevermind\" to a sweet potato that would arrive midway through his meal. In fact, her demeanor completely changed and she didn't open her mouth when she dropped off the check.  We still tipped her as the quality of food was not her fault but we did expect her to remain courteous.   Not done with Longhorn but scratching this location from our list.",

    "text": "After finishing my workout decided to hit up Longhorn since it was across from my gym and I definitely needed a big meal for I go to sleep!!   Got here after 9pm there was about a 15-20 min I guess you can expect that since it was a Friday night. Finally we got seated the hostess was pretty nice. We got to our table and than the waiting started. Is like playing a game you get to the next station and than you wait till the whistle blows than you move!! So got to the table sat down than waited at least more than 5 min till our waitress finally decided to show up and asked us what we wanted to drink and asked us if we were ready to order. I guess she thought that if you let your customer wait before you introduce yourself they will be ready to place an order of what they want. Got our drinks than put our order in. We got the white cheese stuffed mushroom as a appetizer than for our meal we got the Porterhouse for 2 a 30oz steak.   So the food was great!! For me I love mushrooms so the app was pretty amazing and than our Porterhouse was just amazing too. Grilled right not too burnt and it melted like butter when I would cut into the steak. Overall the food was great. The reason I gave it 3 stars tho is because we never really got any attention. Only time we got attention is when the food came out and when it was time to ask if we want any dessert and anything else. My water was never refilled and it was empty, pretty sure my waitress saw it. But I guess she thought since I was done eating I didn't want any more water. Would I go back? Yea I would go back for the food and hopefully I get someone different as a waitress. Also could be since it was getting close to closing time.",

He announced himself with an \"ugh\" and then proceeded to tell one of our guests who was splitting a meal that he guessed he would \"have to split the dinner plate as well.\" After this horrendous welcome, we continued to wait for another 10 minutes before getting our waters and then another 10 passed while we waited for straws. Our waiter's attitude was so terrible, and his breath smelled of alcohol. When the situation was presented to the manager, he said \"he was unaware of anything that was going on\" and demanded to know what we wanted him to do about it. There were several tables around that complained about this waiter and even suggested that we just leave. After 45 minutes, we finally exited the restaurant still hungry and vowing never to return. And to top it off, when the manager found out we were going to leave, he shrugged his shoulders as if to say \"oh well.\" This restaurant will never see me again as the waiter was under the influence and left dirty handprints on our table. The salads were brown. And management seemed to not care or feel any responsibility to correct the situation. To say the least, I feel disrespected and sad to see where customer service is headed these days.",

    "text": "The short story: overcooked, dried out burger, oversalted fries and boring salad. What's there to like?  I gave this other place another try for a late lunch - I got there at 2:30pm, there was maybe a half a dozen customers around. I'd said I'd rather sit on a chair than in a booth, I was given a chair .... in a corner, facing the wall, in an empty restaurant.  This seems to be the norm in Charlotte and I decided not to worry about it.  All I wanted was a medium rare burger w/ bacon (no cheese) and fries. The waitress says they don't do MR, only medium and I decided to leave. The waitress ran to the kitchen and confirmed that they will accommodate my order.   OK, three or four very annoying Dolly Parton songs (I think) later the burger arrives. I gave it one bite and a chunk of dried out ground beef fell out. Sure enough the burger was not MR, M or even MW it was simply well done, as in FU.  Zero stars  Waiting for the waitress to return I had some of the fries but in spite of my hunger I had to stop because they were waaaay too salty, way more than last time and way more that is healthy.   One star  Waitress came, said \"that's not m.r.\" then sent over the manager who asked what I wanted to do. Told her I didn't trust the guy to cook me another burger and I ordered the flat iron steak instead. She also agreed to replace my fries with a house salad with a so called balsamic vinaigrette.     The salad arrives almost immediately and it's ... nothing but tasteless and without interest. I can't believe they would serve a salad like this alongside a $30 steak, it belonged in family restaurant, a cheap one at that.   The steak had a pink center (medium) and again rubbed with the pepper sauce which no one asked me about. I ate, paid and left. What can I say about a steakhouse that can't prepare the meat, the salad or the fries right other than \"no thanks\"?  I still had a $25 gift certificate from corporate for the last fiasco that I was saving for a dinner but I chose to give it away rather than eating here ever again. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 4/17 Edit: Longhorn corporate doesn't bother to contact disgruntled customers anymore than their restaurants do.",

And informed us on the days selections and gave us great suggestions. We started the food journey with the grilled white cheddar mushrooms. They were rich and garlicky very yummy! Then for our entree  we both selected the ribeye steaks, each was cooked perfectly medium and juicy with the perfect amount of fat.

    "text": "We have been to this Longhorn Steakhouse in Matthews in the past and have had excellent service and food.  On Labor Day, 4 of us visited this restaurant and had the worse service in our restaurant history with Longhorn.   We were seated with 2 menus and the hostess had to return with 2 more menus, even though she seated 4 of us.  After that, our server appeared to take our drink order of 3 waters and 1 coffee, which took 15 minutes to deliver.  When the server delivered the coffee with a creamer that was curdled, our guest had to stand up and go find the manager to get a good creamer for her coffee.  We ordered as soon as we received our drinks, and had specific requirements for our salads and our dinners.  Our salad was to be delivered first, and that took 20 minutes after our server took our order, and one of the salads was not correct.  The server returned with the correct salad after I asked him to please hurry because all of us wanted to eat our salads at the same time.   After we were through with our salads, the server did not return back to our table to ask if we were satisfied with our salads; in fact, he did not return for about 20 more minutes.  We were wondering if our entrees were going to be correct when they finally arrived about a half hour later.  3 of our dinners was good, but my husbands order was overdone, but he was really hungry by this time and did not return the meal back to the kitchen, but just ate the over cooked steak.  The server never returned to ask us if our meal was tasty, but he did return after our meal to ask us to stack the empty dishes for him so he could take them to the kitchen.  This act, along with the other issues, was the last straw.  We again asked for the manager and she came over to listen to our story and adjusted our bill somewhat.   The Longhorn Steakhouse needs to make sure that their servers are trained properly in the future.  We will not be returning back to this Longhorn location for a very long time.",

    "text": "Let me state upfront that I rarely do steakhouses, especially chain steakhouses; however, due to a $30 gift card and a steak loving 19-year-old daughter, I opted to make an exception for our Friday lunch date. Boy am I glad I did, as the two sirloin steaks that we ordered where the most tender, leanest sirloins I've ever eaten. I should also add that, as a former butcher, I am very finicky when it comes to beef.  My daughter went with a 6 oz with a side of mac and cheese, which was excellent in itself. It ran about $10.99. I chose the 8 oz with a side of broccoli (perfectly steamed) for $13.99. The steaks were expertly seasoned and accurately cooked. A mini-loaf was also served with butter. Service was friendly and casual but not real attentive, in fact, I ordered a fountain drink that I never received. The dining room had a great atmosphere with  comfortable booths and the sanitation grade was a 97.  At around 35 bucks with tip, it was definitely an expensive splurge, but the lean steaks and  happy daughter, made it all worthwhile. I'm shocked, but the 4 stars for this trip are legit.",

We came in Sunday just after 8pm and the place was dead...open tables as far as the eye could see (which isn't far as this particular location is really small). There was no one at the host stand, but when a guy showed up he let us know that it was going to be a 20min or so wait. All of us looked bewildered...seriously, I think out of the entire place, there were only 3 or 4 tables visibly occupied. Thankfully, it was only about 10mins or so and we start walking to our table when the hostess guiding us was all of a sudden \"Umm, can you guys wait a minute...\" and starts talking to I assume is the manager. Finally, I speak up and ask WTF the problem is!? They don't really reply and just mumble something so I tell my fam, let's go, there are plenty of other places around to get dinner. Then magically, the girl is like \"we can put you here if that's ok\". Don't know what the heck the malfunction was here, but damn Longhorn, get yourself right! You almost lost $100+ tab because you couldn't get us sat in an empty restaurant!?  Our server was an initial hot mess as well, but bless his heart, he was working a 10hr double and you could tell he was just spent. He rallied though and did an great job! He even gave me a comped salad for the fiasco earlier and brought us out a fresh loaf of bread & butter to take home w/our leftovers. He definitely salvaged our dining experience for sure.  The food was fine. It's a generic chain steakhouse, so read into that what you will.   That being said, I think even my Dad is not inclined to come back here again after all that.",

    "text": "We've been going to LongHorn for some time now. Haven't really had too much problem except a surly waiter that we consciously avoid when we go there. Tonight was an exception. My hearing isn't so great, I have hearing aids. I've never had a problem with the volume of the in house country music that they pipe through the place. Tonight, for some reason, it was loud enough for me to turn down my hearing aid to almost silent and I was still hearing this ungodly screeching, discordant noise, at an almost unbearable level, all through my meal. Now my meal was as it usually is, quite good. I tried the clam/lobster chowder for the first time and it was first class, excellent. My dining partner, unfortunately, couldn't say the same. She had a steak, didn't pay attention as to what kind, but it had the cheese thing going on top of it. It was inedible due to a heavy pepper hand in the kitchen. She wasn't able to eat it because there was way to much pepper for a normal human to consume and enjoy it. She eventually sent it back and then had to take it home because by that time she would have been eating alone, although I was perfectly willing to sip my drink and try to converse over the wailing willies coming through the speakers at an ungodly high volume. The waiter, not sure what was going on with him, he seemed a little lost. He seemed very concerned and was attentive without being a pest. I'm just a little concerned that we might have to write LongHorn off our list for something that might be remedied. My meal was good as usual, but somebody in the kitchen was sleeping.",

Once upon arriving, we saw there were multiple tables available. We advised the hostess we would take 2 high tops and was advised no. We advised them we were willing to be separated, still no. We waiting 45 minutes as 4 round tables were behind us dirty and around 13 tables in the restaurant empty. Asked again, if we could do two round tables and advised no. Once we sat down, we were greeted with a waiter who seemed like he had already made up in his mind that we were the type to not tip. Yes. He was challenging and rude. He asked one of my friends why she needed more silverware. This wasnt in the original review but since it was removed, let me share it all. He was asked to bring a salad. Never asked my cousin if he wanted to bring it out with the rest of our salads or with the entrees. We still tip him 25% for a job not well done so next time he won't stereotyped his customers. If u could rate this restaurant a 0 I would. I go to Longhorn all the time in Atlanta and have never experienced this treatment. But, I've copied this review, so if you delete it again, I'll repost.

But, if I'm craving steak and don't have the funds for a BNB outing, this is usually my guilty pleasure choice.   I always get the same thing: a medium rare ribeye with a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad. I switched it up during my last visit because they had a special grilled corn on the cob. I never get an app here because it's too much food, but I do like their shrimp appetizer. It has cherry peppers and is done in a similar style like the calamari at Capital Grill.  Looking around, I watched our poor server get ran to death by a bunch of super demanding tables. I thought he handled it well. In a perfect world, all people should be forced to work both service industry and retail at some point in their lives so they know how to treat people and also act in public.",

The attitudes and trash talking of customers that happens behind the the walls is ridiculous. .The food is always getting served cold, and the waitresses think it's funny you were served nasty food. I let this happen 5 times before I blew up. This restaurant used be to be a good one. I guess management changed and management hired a bunch of riff raffs. Do not, I repeat do not eat here. It will be a one off if you enjoyed it. I promise you you will find out this place cannot handle and does not care to handle traffic or its customers with respect. I love Longhorn as it is one of my favorite places to eat. This location has not made me boycott Longhorn, but I will never return to this location again. Specifics will not be told as I do not want to give the staff there a good laugh as they clearly are immature and unprofessional. I hope you read this warning. I am trying to save you from a very bad experience at this location. Enjoy the other restaurants in the area as they may be a little better. I am not to sure, but the next generation has obviously taken over here and they are ridiculous. .",

The portions on the dinner menu are large and I couldn't finish my salad- it had 6 chicken tenders on it. The burger was tasty and the bacon was crisp.

    "text": "Where do I begin. This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, and I dine out a LOT!  1. Arrived 8pm on a Sunday. Place was pretty much empty. Maybe 5 tables of people. It took 10 mins to be seated, 8 of that was waiting for the hostess to show up.   2. Of all of the nice big booths they had, none that were empty were clean and they put us at a round table in a not so great spot (couple people hit our chairs or pocketbook going by). We were a party of 3 adults and 3 little kids. We were there for the 7 year old's birthday dinner.   3. It took forever for the waitress to appear.   4. It took forever to get our drinks. To compare. Another table came in after us and already had their appetizer before we got our drinks!!   5. She also lied and said you didn't serve chocolate milk (when I know for a fact that you do). AND she served my water with a globby brown thing on the rim. AND served the little kids' milk in these giant glass mugs. They could barely hold them to drink them!! And later she brought them out water in smaller plastic cups with lids. She couldn't do that with the milk?!  6. Our food took forever. That table I mentioned already had their check before we got our food. Our entire visit took 1 hour and 40 mins!  7. While we were waiting, we got to watch as a wine bottle on the wall fell onto a customer. And then our waitress goes over there, tried to put it back on the obviously dubious rack and it falls on him AGAIN!!  8. And then, as she serves that other table their food, she knocks over the woman's martini glass into the man's lap!! She acted like she didn't care at all. Later offered them $5 off their meal. Seriously?!?! Not even a comped drink?!?! The man had to sit and eat in soaking wet alcoholic jeans. Smh.   9. Her attitude was one of \"I don't want to be here\". Not mean but definitely not friendly. She didn't check on us or our food. Didn't do refills. Didn't bring me a new water. Never brought our missing silverware after asking 4 times! Brought us a nearly empty ketchup bottle and signed when we asked her for some BBQ for one of the kids burgers. She was a woman who hated her job.   10. We asked if it was possible to get a large cheese fries for an appetizer. She said sure but when I got the check she charged us $10 for a large chili cheese fries. She never mentioned that's what we would be charged for!!!! She could have at least told us it would be the price of the chili ones so we could have picked something else.   11. I asked for a med well steak. It came out very well done and dry. And the sweet potato wasn't cooked through and hard in the middle and not smooth at all on the softer edges.   Bathrooms were clean so that was appreciated. But that's about the only good thing I can say about our visit. We will never be back.",
