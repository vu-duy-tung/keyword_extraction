I really did enjoy my meal. It was a great experience. Megan was my waitress.  And you know, I think it was really inexpensive. And quick.  I went back on Tuesday. Colleen also provided excellent service.   I didn't care for the New England Clam Chowder, however. I'm not a potato fan and it had too many. And they were small, uniform cubes so I couldn't just push them out of the way and get to the soup. And they were too firm for my tastes.",

The decor reminded me of being in Italy, where you can see the chef making fresh bread in the oven, and you're surrounded by brick walls and dim lights.   I decided to \"Make Your Own Pasta,\" and made a shrimp alfredo pasta with angel hair and asparagus. Very interesting to add the asparagus, but I definitely did not regret it. The downside, however, is that the portions were pretty large, so I was unable to finish. BUT, it did make for a great leftover meal for after going out.   Our waiter was great, too! He gave great suggestions and substitutions for different dishes, and made us feel comfortable and thought of. However, the pricing was pretty iffy and I wouldn't want to always to talk all the dishes home, so I wish the portion sizes were smaller.",

Our drink order was also forgotten. We arrived at 11:45 and didn't get our food until 1:20. It was not very busy although it was lunch time on a Sunday. It was my dads birthday and they did bring out a dessert on the house so that was nice. Thankfully our waitress was polite and the food was tasty but considering the amount of time it took-it could be our last visit. There were 9 of us so maybe a smaller group may have better luck.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here last week and we have been to Macaroni Grill restaurants before but I must say this was the worst service we ever had, only giving two stars because the food was decent.    First our server seemed to have an attitude, we asked for lemons with our waters and after him being back at our table twice after asking he came back with two small lemon slices (not even wedges) and said they were out.  We did later find out they were indeed out, but why not just tell us that in a nice manner before just ignoring our request for 15 minutes.  When our waters were served we were not given straws, then once we asked he took them out of his apron and only had one and threw it on the table and shook his head and walked away without saying anything, then came back after 5 more minutes with two more straws and set them down without saying anything.    We had to ask for bread and he walked by us twice with bread, once giving it to another table that was seated well after us.  This guy really had an attitude, and you know I realize people have bad days so we were being nice and not trying to give him a hard time, I told my wife maybe he is just having an off day.  But it was like that through the whole entire meal.    Also they were not just out of lemons, the table behind us asked for something fried, but we didn't hear exactly what but then we did here the lady say, \"so your out of lemons and this?\"  One thing is a mistake, multiple things being out is bad management somewhere.    The food itself was not bad and typical quality for Macaroni Grill which we really like.    I will drive another 30 minutes away next time to go to the other Charlotte location before going to this one again.  My wife felt bad for even suggesting it after we went, wasn't her fault.",

    "text": "I try to stay away from the chain joints because I always find myself writing mediocre reviews...and I hate writing mediocre reviews.  This was a work lunch so I had to attend.  Well, on to the review...restaurant from the outside seems clean and welcoming.  All of the stone work gives you the feeling of an Olive Garden.  Hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us.  1.00pm on a Thursday must not be a popular time.    We were quickly escorted to our table and I immediately noticed bags of rags(kitchen or waiter rags) scattered across one of the dining tables.  I have to say...I am glad we were not seated at that table.  I am making the assumption they were clean.  I sure do hope so because they could have just been sitting on our table prior to our arrival.  Not a great presentation of the dining area.  Waitress came by, wish I had got her name, but she was very..what's the word I am looking for?  Maybe invasive, like a bull in a china shop?  I have never been reached over so much in my life without an excuse me or pardon me.  Apparently, drink orders, appetizers, and entrees are written in crayon on the paper tablecloth in front of me.  Not really my favorite way of taking an order but...just my opinion.    Had a warm spinach salad with shrimp.  Hmmm, I know it's lunch and everything, but 5 overcooked frozen shrimp?  Tough, clearly overcooked, and just downright horrible.  I think I would have had better luck buying frozen at the grocery store.  I rarely complain anymore because its just not worth it and I don't have the time.  Will not be visiting again.  I hope others have a better experience with different entrees.",

I  met friends for dinner who were in town for the Drag Race series, and our experience was completely opposite of many of the reviews here.  Our server was terrific, and our food arrived promptly and was delicious.  We made a couple of special requests - a side of alfredo sauce, etc. - that were filled promptly and without complaint.  Since we had not seen each other in 20 years (!), we lingered after we had finished eating.  When we apologized to our server for tying up his table, he couldn't have been nicer - and even offered us coffee \"on the house\" so we could continue talking and visiting.  When we finally left, we decided to sit outside on the porch to talk some more - and also decided to order dessert.  Although we were the only ones out there, another very courteous server took our order, brought the desserts and water all around, and never made us feel like we were an inconvenience.  It was a very pleasant evening with good food and thoughtful, prompt service.  No, it's not the most wonderful Italian food I've ever had, but for a quiet evening catching up with friends, it was perfect from start to finish!  I live in the southern end of Charlotte, so don't get up to the University area very much, but, should I have a reason to have dinner there again, I wouldn't hesitate to give Macaroni Grill my business!",

My husband and I normally really enjoy eating at macaroni grill but this location may have ruined it for us. First of all, when we were seated it took 15 mins for us to even be greeted and that was after we finally got the attention of a waitress. After that, my husband immediately asked for the manager to complain about the poor customer service. The manager assured us that he was sorry and that we would be well taken care of, which did not happen!! I really love their Bibb and blue salad which was the only thing that made us stay to order. I ordered the blackened chicken parm and my husband ordered the penne rustica and my son ordered the pepperoni pizza. My chicken was UNDERCOOKED and my son's pizza taste burnt. Our waiter got the manager AGAIN who came and apologized and let us order something else. My son ordered chicken tenders and I reordered the chicken parm and told them to ensure it was cooked thoroughly. The manager brought out our new order and advised me that the chicken wasn't really raw, it was the marinade. As someone who cooks very regularly I think I know what raw chicken looks like! This meal was $54 what a waste! Oh at least they gave us a crumby piece of cheesecake for all of their mishaps. The manager here sucks and doesn't have good customer service. I would not recommend eating here unless you like poor service",

In addition, you may substitute rice pasta for any of the pasta dishes, so that's a plus. Like many things in life, if you go in with the proper expectations, you won't be disappointed at the Macaroni Grill. Also, how can you not love a place that let's you pour your own wine?",

    "text": "I think another location would be better, but I think the cooks just don't care.  We went when it was slow.  Only about six other tables and it was about two hours before closing.    1.  Their famous bread? I had to ask for another.  The outside was so hard it took multiple attempts to cut into it with a knife to break it apart.    2.  Carmela's Chicken.  Greasy.  I'm not sure if they use actual Marsala wine in this sauce or not, but it tasted like it didn't have enough of the alcohol cooked off.  It tasted like you made the dish, then poured a splash of wine over it.    3.  Pollo Caprese.  Chicken breast was dry, tasteless, and 100% devoid of any level of moisture or seasoning and it was also burned.  This happens when a cook \"lays down\" the spatula on top of the chicken in order to get it to cook faster.  The buffalo mozzarella was cold, watery,  and resembled large pieces of chewing gum...not the nice slices that you normally see.  I'm really not sure where the \"caprese\" part comes in.  There was no basil whatsoever in this dish.  4.  Bibb and Bleu salad...had been clearly sitting around for a little while before it came to the table.  Lettuce was not crisp and it was not refrigerator cold.  Sad disappointment.  Never again.  This was not a $40 meal.",

A dish that I have had several times was overcooked.  The penne rustica was clearly overcooked with little sauce.  The butternut squash dish also was over cooked and portions looked burnt.  I did not try to send it back because it was late and the restaurant was getting close to when it closed.  when I pointed it out to the server at the end that i did not believe it was up to their standards, he thanked me for telling him and explained the pancetta is normally chewy.  I have had this dish several times and know what it should taste like and tried to explain it.   That was all said to me. Nothing else. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a huge surprise, and a good one, too!  Here's why:  For a chain, the menu is surprisingly upscale!  Lots of different choices, new and trendy flavor combinations, and different serving sizes available on some items.  The food is fresh and appears to be prepared with care and dare i say it, a sense of pride!  My latest visit here I found myself ordering the Parmesan Crusted Sole.  This is seriously one of the BEST dishes I've ever had in a restaurant.  Let me qualify that by pointing out that I've dined at some pretty special places both locally and across the country.  Seriously, one of the best meals I've had, period.  The fish was perfectly cooked, the lemon butter sauce was silky and perfectly balanced, and the side dish.. oh man!  It was Orzo with radicchio, spinach and sundried tomatoes.  This along with the delicious bread was perfect.  Before I left I glanced at the menu again, and even though I was stuffed, I found my mouth watering over things like Oven Fried Feta, Shrimp and Avocado Brushetta, and some amazing sounding pasta dishes.  This chain has changed a lot over the years.  Their food is much more modern and inventive than what you see at most Italian themed places.  There seems to be a broader influence to the menu.  As for service, I simply could not have asked for better service.  Polite, attentive, friendly and helpful with the menu.  This is a place I suggest you don't pass up!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided on this location and restaurant because he'd never been there before and CLAIMS he doesn't like Italian food. Pah! So I picked this place to change his mind. My mom and I had lunch here a month before and it was delicious then.   Not so much this time.  It was Valentine's day so we expected a wait, we aren't unreasonable. An hour and a half passed and people were seated that came in after us before the hostess noticed we had been there a while. Somehow we were overlooked,  but whatever. I'm starving and happy to be sat!! We were seated in a booth by the bar and didn't have a waitress proper. We had the super busy bartender who had little enough time to make drinks much less remember we needed drinks or silverware or ya know, any attention at all.  Again, can't blame her, it's valentine's day, crazy busy, they likely had callouts or something.  30 minutes later our order gets put in. 30 minutes later our appetizer comes out. Red flag should have been when I heard them 86 the mozzarella app we got. She brought out the appetizer, and just didn't mention how there was no mozz. I guess she figured we were new and didn't know any better. It was just this ricotta ish cheese and no mozz. Okay so the app was meh, main entrees yay! (An hour after putting the order in - dying of hunger lol)   He ordered a pork dish and I had lobster ravioli. His would've been great BUT it was barely warm and tasted like it died in the window.   My ravioli (5, don't order this if you're hungry), weren't even turned upright, which yknow whatever but what disappointed me is that it looked like they had dumped it off the tray they microwaved it in. And it tasted SO MICROWAVED. Mine wasn't hot either but I scarfed it down anyway.   Definitely the worst meal and biggest waste of time I can say I've spent at a restaurant in a long time.",

I had the Italian Bake; 3 large meatballs with 2 links of Italian sausage, plus generous amount of rigatoni pasta served over tomato sauce.  Excellent!!! My husband had their Trio which consisted of fettuccine Alfredo, chicken parmigiana, and lasagna.  Outstanding and very generous portions.  In addition we had side salads. bread with oil for dipping. The wine of was very good!  I hope this place stays in business as it is located between some hotel chains.   We mentioned one small question to our waiter and next thing the manager came to our table to insure all was acceptable. They are paying attention to the customer and aim to please.   Please come out to support this place!! I wouldn't walk across the street for Olive Garden, but this place is a real gem!!!",

    "text": "This place is only getting 2 stars as they comped my salad, meal, glass of wine, and soda without me asking to.  WORST dining experience EVER. First off, not even a fan of this place, but it was a coworker's birthday, and she chose to dine here. It was Race Week in Charlotte, but the restaurant was not overly packed near 7 PM. We were seated quickly, and our waiter took forever to even take our drink orders. 15 minutes in, he finally gets our drink orders. Then within the next 15 minutes, he brings out our drinks, one by one...30 minutes in, we finally get the freshly baked foccacia bread (which is really the only thing I like about Macaroni Grill). 45 minutes in, FINALLY takes our damn order. I was so irritated but tried to keep my cool since I was with coworkers. I asked about the pasta sampler which only caught my eye because of the proscuitto mac and cheese. It also included the sausage quadratini and carmela's chicken. I decided to order that to get a variety. We all ordered salads as well to start. About 20 minutes later or so, the diet coke I ordered never came, so I asked for it. Then he slowly brings one salad out at a time. REALLY? First one, no dressing. Second one, no bleu cheese. Third one, no bleu cheese or pancetta. Fourth one, no ranch dressing on the side or pancetta. Mine, no pancetta. Only the caeser salad was the one that came out how it should be. About...30 minutes later (we were there for over 2 hours...we had no issues talking and hanging out, but it was getting ridiculous!) our food finally came out. As the manager started bringing out the dishes, I mentioned that our salads were all wrong (I finally mentioned as I didn't want our food to be \"messed up\"), and he apologized. Then a server starts to hand me a dish that was completely off and not mine. So...I got to wait for 15 minutes while they re-created my dish, and being the slowest eater of the group, I was tempted to just take it to go. Another dish did not have the mozerrella cheese she had requested. When my food finally came, it was all lacking in flavor. The mac and cheese was as dry as can be, boxed mac and cheese would probably have been better, and I think there were two chunks of proscuitto, the size of a penny. I barely touched my meal, and pushed it aside.  When the bills came, I had heard him say they took the salads off the bills, which was great. I didn't see my bill, and was told everything was taken off. Which was a really nice gesture, but since we were expensing to the company, it was a time where I wished I was paying out of my own pocket. Overall, I would never dine here again. Servers really need to learn how to question the cooks if obvious ingredients are missing, and not hand dishes out one by one. The cooks should also know these standard dishes like the back of their hands and keep the food consistent.",

It was at about 1/3 capacity mostly with two large groups.  Our waiter was wonderful ( I think his name was Darren).  My plate arrived with burnt potatoes. I gave them a try but they were so dry there was no way, the broccoli was cold BUT... when my steak that was ordered medium came out still mooing, that was it for me.  I was starving and don't think I have ever sent back food in my life but 0 for 3?  Was NOT having it.  Waiter was very nice, apologetic and put the order in again.  Then comes who I thought was the chef to bring me my food.  Gave me a bit of attitude and then I realize that they took the same steak and basically killed it.  It was now so dry I could barely eat it.  I thought about complaining to the manager only to realize that the chef with the 'ttude was in fact said manager.  NEVER AGAIN.",

    "text": "So I've been to this location of Macaroni Grill a couple times now. I have this sort of nostalgic experience of going to a Macaroni Grill in the Chapel Hill/RDU area. Seems like it has always fallen short of that memory for me here.  To start with, the worst part would have to be the host/hostess service. Went in here on a more recent visit and the THREE hosts took several minutes to even acknowledge us while there wasn't even a line! One host seemed almost spaced out like he didn't know where he should be...he may have been high... The table waitstaff has been great though. Always friendly and responsive and quick with the food. Oh...and bread!  Speaking of bread, Olive Garden can shove off. Macaroni Grill's rosemary bread is the BEST. Hands down. For any chain restaurant fine dining establishment. Glazed in sea salt and soaked in olive oil with freshly cracked black pepper. Perfecto! Of course you can't go Italian without ordering pasta. Their pasta isn't flawless but it's better than most. I like to get some kind of seafood usually. On my most recent visit I got Pasta di Mare with shrimp, scallops and mussels. I was a bit disappointed in the just two shrimp and two scallops I got. But the shrimp are large at least. None of the seafood was overcooked either - always a good thing when eating out!  I also feel the need to mention that your server will come by and write their name on your table upside down - a skill they're clearly taught in training. You can also take to the crayons and color all over the paper covering the table cloth too. If you haven't been to Macaroni Grill yet, you need to get here. Trade your next Olive Garden outing for a visit to this place. It is the best Italian you can get out of the chains.",

I ordered a 3 course special they had going on which I regret because when traveling for business I can't stuff myself and then go meet with a client and this food was delicious so I took small bites of everything.  I think next time I would do a salad to avoid temptation of pasta but it was so good.     I mean I don't see how anybody could prefer another \"Italian\" chain.  Their bread is 100x better and comes with olive oil.  My meal came with a fried cheese stick which was not good - my only complaint/ thing I didn't have to tell myself to stop eating.  It also came with a Caesar salad which was a bit over dressed but other wise delicious.  I would ask for dressing on the side unless you are into more dressing than veggies LOL!  I had the fettuccine as my dish and it had Gorgonzola, pancetta, and spinach.  It was great but rich.  I can't wait to come back and try a salad or maybe spaghetti and meatballs.",

    "text": "Here from Charleston for the weekend with my husband and staying at the Marriott next door. This place was terrible. We are foodies and saw reviews to try it and it was so good. Well... service was terrible. It was not busy at all.. Mariah was our server and we saw her twice. The manager had to bring our salads.. after our entree was brought.. it was just wet lettuce on a plate with no dressing and some croutons. Mariah came back and put a hard as a rock loaf of bread on the table.. no knife or anything . I figured we are supposed to just tear it apart like animals... the table cloths are sheets of white paper that the server draws their name on like a kindergartner with crayon for us to remember I guess ... kinda silly for a restaurant that is not cheap and mostly adults... I had the chicken scallopini .. it was swimming in oil and butter and the lemon was so over powering I tasted nothing else.. I sat for 10 min waiting to see our server to send it back but we never saw her again til we had to leave.. 2 hours into our service. I ended up covering my food in black pepper and ate it anyways since it was late and we were ready to hear back to our hotel. Boy am I paying for it now.. my husband and myself have been throwing up all night and fire diarrhea.... yes we both got good poison.... I will be contacting them when they open but this is unacceptable. We did complain and was given our appetizer for free...",

My favorite was the melted cheese... fuendo I think it was called. It was addicting!  Melted mozzarella cheese mixed in with other cheese. With bread to spread the cheese on. And they give you a lot of cheese... melted stringy goodness...  The main courses were huge! I had the chicken and mushroom cannelloni.  Very good. Little salty, but good.

    "text": "I would like to start by saying : Brinker, get your stuff together. I am not sure why such a legendary restaurant that used to be very lucrative in the 90's and 2000's has slowly declined.  I drove to this location on University and was not impressed.  Last time I had lunch there was 3 years ago, and what a difference what is now.  I got there with another party for lunch, was seated right away.  The server was nice.  She kept up with refills, checked on us when we got our food.  Now: the food... Pasta Milano is the dish I always have ordered since it came out over 15 years ago. A while back the company decided to do without this staple dish which was not a good idea. For those who have dined with Macaroni Grill for a long time you get the idea.  The menu has drastically been minimized. Lots of good dishes has been 86!  ( Server lingo look it up). Penne Rustica : gone.  Pasta Bolognese: gone.  Shrimp Scampi: gone.  Pasta Di Mari: gone.  The Pasta Milano that I ate was disgusting.  The chicken was seemed to be precooked or cooked separately from the dish's sauce.  They skimped on the mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and to add insult to injury: bow tie pasta which completed this dish was changed to big hollow tube pasta which was served in a smaller plate to give the illusion you got more for your money. NOT. $17 per dinner portion.  No manager to be seen.  2 servers for the entire restaurant for lunch time.  Kitchen cook seemed she cooked  the dishes  in a rush out of her way.   There's no reason for us to go back to this location.  Another bites the dust.",

    "text": "I remember this chain being OK long ago in the past, even if very inconsistent.  However, this was the worst and poorest experience I ever had at any branch.  The food was horrible and flavorless, and the service and kitchen staff couldn't have delivered less.  I could even see how slow motion, uninspired, and sloppy the kitchen staff was thanks to the open kitchen concept.  I asked for some marinara sauce on the side and they had the nerve to serve me totally cold uncooked sauce. I think the customers are luckly if they do not get sick eating here.  I only hope writing this review reminds me to never go back to any Macaroni Grill ever again.  I definitely would never return to this one!  A one star rating can not even properly reflect how bad this restaurant is...  How do they remain in business?",

I was seated immediately.   My waitress, Colleen was a foodies dream. She knew the menu inside out. I think she has actually tasted everything on the menu. When I asked what was good for my meal she picked everything out and it was all delicious!!   She recommended the ultimate Bellini, which is made with Bacardi rum, prosecco, bianco, peach puree and blk raspberry. 10 thumbs up!!! I'm a Bellini girl so this was different.   My entree was a buffalo chicken parmigiana. It's breaded and dipped in Frank's red hot hot sauce, topped with melted mozzarella cheese and hot peppers. The capellini is tossed in olive oil and bleu cheese crumbles and blk pepper. Pieces of celery garnish the side. I had some Rosemary baked bread and something called Italian butter, which is olive oil and blk pepper. You dip the bread in the mix and ur taste buds are dancing.   Dessert was a warm homemade chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and whipped cream.   I'll definitely come again. I want to try half of the menu!!",

    "text": "I came with a party of 6 people and, despite being almost completely empty, they tried to shove us into a four person booth. I eventually asked to be moved and they accommodated us. We ordered drinks and apps and everything was good. When our entrees came out, however, one persons food did not come. The waitress, who seemed like a nice woman, came over and told us that they lost the ticket and asked him to fill out a new order form and asked if we wanted to see the manager. We said yes and the manger never came. My friends food came out a good 10 minutes after the rest of ours. Working at a resturant I know that the right thing to do would have been to comp the meal for the person whose food was late, or at the very least offer condolences and provide a discount. However, when it was time to pay, the waitress brought out a full price check for everyone, including the person whose food was late. I asked to speak to a manager again and was told the \"manager was too busy\" but that she would see about the ticket. She came back like 7 minutes later with a new check that had two dollars off. Not once did she apologize for the kitchen losing the ticket or try to fix the mistake by discounting the meal, only after we asked did she make an effort, begrudgingly I might add, to reconcile the mistakes that were made. The food was amazing, especially the macaroni bites, it's just a shame that the management and staff practice such poor customer service. Won't be back.",

It took our waitress a good 5-10 minutes to take our drink order and another 5 after that to get the drinks. She almost forgot to take the entree order of one of us and there were always dishes on the table. Salad bowls when the entrees came, and entree dishes when dessert came which took another 15 minutes to receive. Drinks were empty a lot and when my mom was trying to take a drink out of her empty coke the waitress came up behind her with a new one saying \"Hold on, I'm coming!!\"  Overall, food was still amazing but service was horrible. Maybe go for take out or sit at the bar. Avoid the front of house staff and much as possible and you'll be great.",

I waited 48 minutes for the mozzarella. I am still waiting for the other portion of my meal. Macaroni Grill used to be my go-to  place. The atmosphere is always been inviting and the sanitation grade exceptional. The bartenders and other servers tend to be professional to take pride in their work. Many a cold rainy afternoon has been spent at the bar  where I have truly enjoyed the food even when they transition to frozen  sauces .  Macaroni Grill  was always a consistent mid-level restaurant where you could get it very quick bite before work.    I'm going to Lodge a complaint and then walk out after writing this. What a disappointment.  Parr Two:  In their defense, when the problem was brought up with the bartender, the manager came out immediately and provided a to-go order at no charge. This was an acceptable outcome. All parties involved were professional, courteous, friendly, and apologetic.",

The reviews weren't great but it is located across the parking lot from the hotel where I say on frequent business trips.  After a long day at the office, we just didn't want to drive anywhere so a quick stroll to MG fit the bill.  The interior of this chain hasn't ever changed - same format, same decor but I guess rustic-Tuscan doesn't really go out of style.  We ordered cocktails, wine and dinner and our server was polite and efficient.    I had the Eggplant Parmigiana and it was excellent - very lightly breaded topped with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce and a side of pasta.  Their portions are HUGE and definitely shareable.    I am so glad we decided to give this location a try in spite of the less than stellar reviews - our experience will bring us back for sure.",

We arrived at 7:50pm we had walked in the restaurant  was HALF empty and we were told 1 hour wait. We were surprised by the amount of time since literally no one was there. But we figured since we were a party of 14 that was why.  9 pm rolls around and every table that was empty had dishes pilled up and not cleaned off. Since we were there there was a long table that when we got there they told us they would clean off... at 9:00 It was still full of dishes from the party before.   At 9:15 we stood at the hosts stand waiting for an update, she completely ignored us and so did the manager, they kept walking by never stoping.  At 9:30 we finally were able to get her attention n she had another waitress start cleaning off the table and they said 15 more minutes.  We watched as she took a few dishes off and never came back.  They also in that time period sat many smaller parties but never sat us. Once we saw that she wasn't coming back to finish the rest of the table and seat us we looked for the hostess to let her know we were leaving because now it's been a 2 hour wait for bad imitation Italian and HORRIBLE service. Come to find or the hostess left for the night, as did we. Won't ever be coming back and that's a shame since for years we've given them our business and even hosted a family members rehearsal dinner there. It's a real shame they obviously need  better management a new hostess and a much kinder bartender (didn't even go into how rude she was to us)  PS this is the second review I've ever done in all the years I've used yelp.

The sauce was tasty, but this entree was $19, way too much for a big bowl of pasta! The gelato dessert was good, but I asked for the \"crumbles\" to be served on the side and they were not. I asked for another done properly and waited almost 15 minutes for the replacement and had to flag down the waitperson to finally get it. I really did not want it anymore by then and my companions had already finished their desserts and were ready to leave. No apology from waitstaff. Booths were very uncomfortable, our backs hurt at the end of the meal because the seats were so far away from the table. Never returning, there are too many excellent restaurants in Charlotte with high quality food and attentive service to be overcharged and under attended like that.",

I rarely complain but as the 2nd hour approached, I questioned our placement on wait list. Oh wait, they now can not find our name... the list had been mixed in with menus and then I was told by management the hostess is good at her job and we will be sat shortly (a bit over another hour). We visit this location at least once a month. Food has always been great but this definitely put a bad taste in my mouth.

Took them 3 minutes to figure out where to put me in a 80 % empty joint.  Figured out what I wanted before waiter showed up.. about another 5 minutes, glass of wine and simple chicken dish with house salad and water.  5 minutes later got the wine,(got to see manager speaking to the floor team while I waited).  Wine glass was wet when it showed up... dripping water.  But no water,  5 to 10 min later the house creaser showed up.  Still no water, had to ask what was suppose to go with the plate of olive oil.  Finished salad chicken dish showed up warm and the dollop of cheese on the pasta was still firm and not melting.  Sent it back at that time I said screw it and thru down a 20 and left.  Not a word as I walked by my waiter and the manager.  Food in this area sucks.  Read my other review of TGIF... it seems that one should not eat in north charlotte.  UPDATE... Now after for some reason needing to repost it.  They are finally asking me to follow up an help them by retyping everything that is in the review above.  It is clear that management of this outlet does not get it.  If you want my send me an phone number and contact to call.  do not send me to a lame fill in the form and tell us what went wrong.

The wait staff was friendly and our server, very attentive. The bread was excellent, as we remembered it was. Two of us got our favorite Portifino Shrimp. Not like we remembered it. Not much flavor.Lobster Bisque was tasty. We were shocked when we saw that a glass of Chardonnay was $12, yes, $12, and the wine was not that great. To sum up, good service, so-so meal, outrageous  wine prices. Won't be back anytime soon. Too bad, it used to be very good....",

Our server left us sitting at the table for twenty minutes without coming to take our order. The employees were all gathered around the kitchen area hanging out and socializing rather than taking care of customers. The pasta sauces are nowhere as good as they used to be. They are way too stingy with the amount of sauce they use. Must be to save money. The bread is no longer soft and warm. Ours was crusty and dry. This was such a disappointment as we no longer have a Macaroni Grill in Wilmington so we came to the one in Charlotte looking for old faithful. The powers that be need to pay a visit to this location ASAP.",

To my surprise the order was 100% correct, Debbie did not forget any items (normally over looked items:  cups, utensils, napkins, seasonings, oils, ice, etc). Everything was so good that my boss texted me later that evening to tell me how impressed he and everybody else was with lunch. He has NEVER sent me a text outside of work hours.

It was my little sisters sweet 16 birthday dinner. After calling numerous restaurants Macaroni Grill was the only one willing and able to accommodate 27 people. Upon arrival we were assured by multiple members of the staff how grateful they were we chose them and how they'd like to make this a memorable experience. Considering the disaster from the year before we were all a bit nervous. They setup a table in a back room with a board featuring my sister's name and wishing her a happy birthday.   We had two servers assigned to our party I can't remember the ladies name but our male servers name was Caleb and he was a doll. Extremely knowledgeable, answering all of our questions without attitude and being very attentive.   Everyone's food came out correct and tasted amazing. I had the Penne Rustica which was to die for and my wife had the Pollo Caprese both dishes were tasty. They both came with salads, we got the dressing on the side. A few in our party said theirs were overdressed but not to the point of being inedible. My wife also drank a blood orange Italian soda (no  refills) but it was yummy. Dinner was followed by chocolate cake for my sister and servers singing Happy birthday.   All and all this was an amazing experience and we will definitely be back in the future.",

I do not eat at Macaroni Grill often but I do always enjoy it and find it to be a nice restaurant chain.  Now with this said, this particular location exceeded every expectation I had walking into that place.  I flew in early that morning from Chicago for the meeting and I was flying back to Chicago right after the meeting.  Eating lunch at this point was a necessity therefore I wasn't looking for any type of 'experience'.  Macaroni Grill is good, the food would be good, I knew it'd be quick enough and I just needed food.  Little did I know that I'd be greeted by the friendliest hostess and a gentleman who I think might have been a chef or in the kitchen at least?  Unfortunately I did not get their names but Dakota was my server and he was very, very good.  It  was just a very, very nice lunch experience and you could tell that this restaurant focuses on service from the top down.  Thanks for a nice lunch!",

The chickens was cooked just right, not over cooked and dry like some restaurants . It had a nice taste with the spices they had on top.  They gave you a little side salad, it was okay. The capellini was good, tasted homemade. There was a chunky sauce on top, however it did not have enough, so I asked the waitress to bring more and she return with a small bowl of sauce . The mozzarella on top of the pasta was slightly melted and good.  It came with a hot rosemary round bread . Topped with salt and olive oil.  They gave you extra virgin  olive oil , for dipping. Very good.   The service was good, friendly and efficient.",

Almost couldn't find the restaurant because it was not well lit and there were very few cars in the lot. In spite of that we went in. The place had few customers but there was a group of 4 people waiting to be seated. We were seated immediately while they waited another 7-8 minutes. (There were only 4 other tables with customers)  We each ordered different dishes ranging from pizza to grilled chicken salad to chicken capris and another chicken dish. My wife ordered lobster ravioli and I ordered eggplant Parmesan. We should have known things were amiss when the waitress came back and said they were out of one of the dishes, and table of 4 that was seated 15 minutes after we were received their food almost immediately.   Finally, our food began to arrive. My soup came out first and then a salad and one chicken dish and then my eggplant. It was 10 minutes later that my wife's lobster ravioli arrived and another 5 minutes before the pizza came out. The last entree wasn't served until those of us served first were almost finished. All the time the kitchen staff appeared to be talking and joking with the wait staff.   I can't really speak for the rest of our party, but my eggplant was dry and over cooked and my wife's lobster ravioli had more vegetables than lobster.   Suffice it to say, I doubt if we will return for seconds.",

Work dinner, fifteen-top table and I was a little worried but nobody was in the restaurant, therefore you should have prompt service right?  Not necessarily. All I asked for was a bottle of soda water. I waited for twenty minutes and eventually I asked if she could bring it. She said sure. I wait another five minutes and then she brings me the bottle without a glass. Then I ask for the glass and wait another five minutes yielding a total of 30 minutes, but who is counting? (I am) for a bottle of Pelligrino.  Finally she takes the orders. And we wait. And wait. And wait for a whole hour, that's one hour and thirty minutes, but who's counting? (I am)  I have to go, I had things to do and I expected to be paying for my check in 90 minutes, so I go to the door and say I need to leave because we've been waiting on our food for an hour and the hostess asks me if I'd like it boxed. I said sure. So I wait another seven minutes, but who's counting? (I am) and I finally get my food so I can eat it in my hotel, and it was the toughest overcooked chicken breast jerky I've tasted with waterlogged pasta and the only thing that is cold is the buffala cheese that is supposed to be melted on the chicken...I threw half of it out.  The worst part is I used to eat here before and it wasn't like this. So, if you're the general manager of this place, you have some issues. Perhaps it's you, I don't know, but I've not felt so ignored in years.",

    "text": "8620 Research Drive  At one point are used to live very close to this particular restaurant while I resided in the university section of Charlotte North Carolina but not too long ago moved away.  The university section of Charlotte is on the very north end of town and filled with college students. I have since moved away and now live on the south side of town so it is rare that I get back to the Macaroni Grill however I do still like the food.   On this particular occasion last week, I had to be on that side of town and had a taste for food a light pasta. I placed an order by phone for a very simple pasta with plain marinara sauce and specified to the employee that I did not want a meat sauce.  (I don't eat pork and am allergic to shellfish).  She repeated my order back to me confirming what I wanted  and I told me that it would be ready in 10 minutes. That was perfect for me as I was about 10 minutes away and wanted to pick up my food before I got on the highway to go home.  Upon arrival the woman working the take-out counter has the food container in her hand and is placing it inside a bag. She motions to me confirming that I am the one who ordered the spaghetti to go and I responded yes.  I make my purchase, take my food and leave the store. I get in my car and I drive the 40 minutes home (there is traffic).   Once at home, I open my  bag, take out my food, and begin eating.   Imagine my dismay at finding bits of sausage buried in my food. I immediately called the restaurant and ask to speak with the manager.  I am put on an indefinite hold and 8 minutes later call back to the store again.  The second time, the manager answers the phone and after hearing my complaint advises that I had not been given what I asked for but instead  had been given Spaghetti Bolognese which includes Italian sausage. I told her this is not what I ordered and that it was too far for me to return to the store.  She advised that there was no need as she was aware of what had happened and advised that she would credit my debit card.  That together with her apology for the substitution makes me say okay mistakes do happen.    On a side note : I don't eat pork for health reasons so finding surprise sausage in my food is not only unwelcome, but also dangerous. I took this opportunity to explain to the manager how substitutions, cross contamination and sloppy inattentive food handling could make someone very sick or worse.  I suggested that the staff be reminded of their duty to get the orders correct.  I will think twice about returning to this location and anytime I ever place an order I will pull it out at the counter and thoroughly inspect inside the containers as they cannot be trusted to do that for you.",

I, personally, have three kids here and one of my children's orders was a simple butter noodles with cheese... her meal came last. We were told by the server that 'it had been entered three times but someone keeps taking it.' That is not my problem. Our party had 30 people and every single meal was brought out at a different time. No one even was able to eat together.  The restaurant was by no means full or 'busy'. Our reservation was for 5:15, it's now 7:10 and we are STILL waiting on correct meals to be delivered. Two hours later. A few people in our party cancelled their meals due to poor service. No one should have to wait over two hours for food to be delivered. Even ordering drinks was a nightmare. A beer or a Prosecco took over an hour to be delivered. Would not recommend this location - ever. Unless you have three hours of life to waste and like eating cold food. Super disappointed in our service and meal.  *edit. After our awful service I was able to speak to the manager who ended up comping our food and drinks- just charging for my one glass of wine. So. While the service and the experience were still awful, and I would not recommend this location, I did want to come back and give them credit for making it right. Thus changing my review from one star to two.",

    "text": "We had a gift card for Macaroni Grill. My husband always liked the chicken parm there. When we first moved here (18 years ago) we went there and liked it. However, it is not nearly as good. My husband still liked his chicken parm but the calamari was not done well and not crispy.  I ordered gluten free Alfredo fettuccini and it was brown on top and the noodles were hard. I don't usually order Alfredo and was looking forward to a delicious meal. It wasn't. Besides the noodles the sauce did not taste like traditional Alfredo. I doubt they even used any real butter. The waitress knew I didn't like it and someone who looked like another waitress came over and said she was sorry and she wouldn't charge us. I felt funny so I said that that was not the reason I said anything. So she DID charge me!  Never again.",

    "text": "I was in the mood for Italian food and Macaroni Grill popped up on a Postmates party, so I thought I'd give it a try. It had been about 10 years since I ate at Macaroni Grill last, but I remember the food being pretty good. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo, a side Caesar salad, the goat cheese pepper appetizer, and the bruschetta. I was disappointed to say the least. The fettuccine was incredibly bland and was comparable to noodles covered in Great Value alfredo sauce. The side salad was just lettuce and a side cup of Caesar dressing with 3 or 4 croutons. The goat cheese pepper appetizer wasn't too bad, but the portion (6 peppers) was way too small for what you pay. The bruschetta had to have been the worst thing I ordered. It was a couple small pieces of toasted bread and a huge cup of diced, unseasoned tomatoes. This meal was the nail in the coffin for Macaroni grill and chain restaurants similar to it. I paid over $25 for food that I could make better at home for less than $5.",

Our server, Jessica, was so kind and so patient. She had a lot of great experience and made really great conversation. Our food came out in a timely manner, we had a large party so we understood we had to wait a little bit. It's sad that business has slowed down for Romano's Macaroni Grill, especially since the food is still very good. We got an array of food, and everybody was happy with their meal. I highly recommend visiting this place since it used to be the place everybody wanted to go whenever I was younger. I hope this place has a revival, because the food is still great, and the people are still quite warm. It was my birthday, and they still sang to me in Italian. I would recommend a little cleanup in the bathroom, it was a bit messy, but something I understood. Thank you Romano's, for being a place that brings back such good memories and still has good food.",

Our drinks were empty for over 20 minutes. After asking our server multiple times we would get the \"oh I'm sorry let me get the pitcher\" ... then she would walk away and forget to bring the pitcher of water over. We finally flagged the hostess down and she was able to refill the water for us.. The food looked great coming out, but for how slow it was in there we got concerned when our server wasn't bringing it to us and it was another server. Go figure, the food absolutely sat in the window for a while. The chicken was barely lukewarm. After having to legitimately WAVE MY HAND at our server from across the way as she chatted with co workers, she came over and we let her know the food was cold.  The best part- THEY REUSED ALL THE SAME FOOD!! When it was taken back we had at this point all cut into our chicken.. they tried to replate the food and make it seem like it was all new. NOPE! They just put sauce over our already cut chicken from the first time. I truly find that disgusting. Food going back into a kitchen should be thrown away and re made. Overall I went in assuming this would be a disappoint, and I was correct. I just wish I didn't waste $30 for lukewarm, reheated food, and crappy service from a pretty slow restaurant where they could be more attentive. Won't be back, won't recommend.",

Nothing sucks but none of it is great.    This location was in easy walking distance to my hotel, and I was too lazy to drive anywhere.  I sat at the bar and had several Italian margaritas (actually decent).  Tried the olives as an appetizer ($4 special).  The olives came warm and with bread.  They were okay.  Next up was the caesar salad.  Not bad.  Now on to the entree, Chicken Marsala.  It was just okay.  Chicken breast was really thin.  Marsala sauce, just okay.    Ended the night with another appetizer (I was still damn hungry), fried artichokes, along with dessert (vanilla gelato).  Much of the artichoke appetizer was like eating dried leaves.  The bigger and meatier pieces were pretty good.  The gelato was actually the best item I ate all night.",

Food is SO much better than Carrabas, Olive Garden, etc., I don't know if locals don't know good Italian food when they taste it (I'm from Boston, which has many great Italian restaurants), or if it's a weekend problem (I almost never eat out on weekends, since service is always worse on busy nights at any restaurant). We went Wednesday for my birthday, and it was great; the Italian nachos appetizer was one of the tastiest dishes I have had in last few years, and the bill was less than I anticipated. My favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte, not a 5 star Chicago/NY/Boston restaurant, but it is very good for the money, and I heartily recommend it.",

Well.........I should have conituned with the tradition of leaving this place alone. First, our waitress went missing a few times. We had to ask another waitress, which I hate doing because they have their own tables they are watching, for something different because our food was extremely salty. After sending our food back, you would think that our waitress would come back and ask what happened and apologize.....Nope. The manager brought out our food but never apologized. Her body language basically said, \"Don't speak to me and don't complain.\"...Great leadership. Our waitress never circled back to see if we were doing until about 15-20 minutes later. It's terrible when you try to give a restaurant another chance but fail, yet again. You would think that they would really try a little harder to provide excellent customer service and delicious food, especially when there are only a few Macaroni Grill's left.",

Flat bread was full of white flour on the bottom, we had to literally scrap the flour out of it. Finally we decided to leave it because one could have a stomach ache with so much uncooked flour. Soup was served cold with basil leaves which were dry. Pasta was ok but too greasy.  Service - Our server's name was Austin and it felt as if he was not at all interested to service us. He did not have the silverware on the table, we had to ask for it. Half way through the meal, we had to ask him if he would serve bread and olive oil. He got some bread but kept it and left with nowhere to be seen for another 10-15 mins. We ordered 2 pasta but we got only one. Intentionally we didn't say anything because we were already pissed off by then. When the bill came, the pasta which never came was there in the bill, so we had to get that removed.

Since it just so happened none of us had been to MG in a while, we decided this would be our spot (we used to go regularly as a group when we still worked together at a nearby office).  Things have changed.  ATMOSPHERE: They still have this going for them.  This is one of the main reasons we used to gather here to begin with.  Still a great place to just kick back in a booth, relax with friends or loved ones, and not worry about having to be too quiet or having to talk over deafening music and patrons.  Noise level is just right, which is greatly appreciated.  Few places are able to balance debauchery and civility so well.  SERVICE: We had a great waitress. She was really on-point, even as the crowds increased, being neither too obtrusive nor inattentive.  One thing I really appreciated was that she attempted to quickly \"get to know us\" a bit--this helped her help a few of US make decisions when too many things looked yummy or weren't in the mood for anything specific.   Friendly. Prompt. Attentive. Knowledgeable. What more could you ask for?!  FOOD: NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.  Don't get me wrong, it's still palatable; HOWEVER, you can tell the quality has diminished drastically.  I ordered the Mediterranean Olives ($2) in citrus marinade as an appetizer. Must say I really enjoyed those (sodium warning...whew!).  Another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ($9).  This was a disappointment.  While the price was average/reasonable, one expects more than just a few bland, nearly tasteless rings of the stuff.  It was mostly the tentacle ends of the poor lil' squid.  And lots of them.  Odd.  Her lobster ravioli ($18) was yummy according to her (looks a tad skimpy, but said it was quite filling).   My Pasta Milano ($12) was nothing like it used to be.  It's now made with rigatoni instead of bow-tie. In-and-of-itself, that's no big deal, but if you're a 'pasta person' you know how specific types of pasta can make a dish (along with the texture).  Another of us ordered the Chicken Parm ($13).  Nothing special there. Hafta say it kind of looked like something you could prepare at home & was told it tasted pretty much the same.  All-in-all I have to say they seem to have \"gone cheap\" on their food, ingredients, and preparation.  They seem to have soured along with the economy.  I hate to say it, but MG (at least this location) is pretty much off my radar now.  Their close proximity doesn't win out over quality.",

Of course it was raining cats and dogs which surely kept many at home.  But what was odd is that the entire staff was running around organizing everything for the dinner service as if they had just arrived even though they open at 11:00 AM on Sundays.  Again, kind of odd.    But regardless, I was seated and served promptly, the beers were ice cold and refreshing, and the food came out fresh and as ordered.    I ordered the Lasagna and a Caesar salad.  Accompanied by a tasty loaf of bread with olive oil, it was very good.  Really hit the spot on a dreary, rainy day.  I would not anything was special.  Just very good. I'm sure I will be back.",

Our waitress was really friendly, but not over the top and kept a check on us frequently.   I had an Italian Mojito which I don't recommend, period...blech.    We got the Zucchini Friti for an appetizer which was perfect and the dipping sauce was delish and the best part of our whole meal!  I got a salad with ranch dressing - it was fine...nothing special.  I ordered the Carmela's Chicken and it was bland, almost dry and overall just lacking.  I brought more home than I ate and reheated with some garlic sauce I had making it better than the original for lunch the next day.  I wouldn't get it again.  My husband got the steak and had fries that were better than the steak, which I thought was WAY undercooked, even for medium.  Blech!  I would give our waitress an extra .5 half star or maybe even a star, but our food was definitely not over a two star this visit.  Good thing we had a gift card.  We left a nice tip for our waitress with the balance since we had no plans of returning in the near future.",

When I walked in, I had to wait to get someone to acknowledge me for a few minutes even thought here were many employees there. Then once I told them I wanted a takeout they told me \"you'll have to order at the bar or if you can get someone, you can order from the kitchen\". I paced between kitchen & the bar for few more minutes before I finally got someone in the kitchen only to be told \"you need to order from the bar\". (Aren't you in front of an active computer??)  Oh and I was with my 13 mo old too. Really? I just want my food & go back to my hotel!! Not only my lobster ravioli was a $18 waste of money, my baby's \"mac& cheese\" was just a bowl of penne with thin cheese sauce poured over them. I paid for that fraud???

    "text": "So we decided to celebrate our son's excellent grades with a dinner out. Mac Grille seemed a nicer choice than others so we stopped by. We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it, both the hostess and the waitress were very pleasant and professional throughout. Shame on Mac Grille for understaffing though.  To the food! Meh.  My wife had something called Carmela's Chicken. It was a nice looking bowl of rigatoni, chicken, mushrooms and other assorted goodies. She seemed to enjoy it but I found it to be fairly ordinary. As a guy who cooks professionally, I am always looking to be blown away with flavor or at the very least something that I didn't think to make at home. It could have used a little salt (especially in the pasta boiling water) to bring out the nice semolina taste in the noodles. The important thing is that she liked it and was happy.  I got Mama's Combo. A plate with lasagna, chicken parm and a chicken and mushroom cannelloni. The cannelloni was pretty good the lasagna was the star of the plate but the chicken parm was a pure throw away. I was unaware of where on the chicken a round disc of breast meat comes from (probably right nest to the nugget!). If I was to bet my last dollar on something to regain my vast fortune I would place it on the fact that the chicken came straight out of a box, already breaded and cooked and flash heated and put on the angle hair. Very disappointed. Did really enjoy the lasagna bolognese, though.  So, who knows, maybe one day we go back, but honestly I don't think we will feel on our deathbeds that we missed out on anything special if we never stop by again. Shame.  Also, just FYI, they were out of 2 of the 4 tap beers walking into a Friday night! Who does that? May as well run out of parmesan cheese! Oh yeah speaking of parmesan cheese, I hate restaurants that have the server put the parm on your food in those grinders. Seems like if you like a lot of parm on your grub (like all of us) you are screwing it up for the other tables, so you allow them to leave too darned soon and you are left wanting more but felling a bit shy and embarrassed to ask them to come back and pile on some more. Just sayin.  Eat Well!!!!!! V-Dub",

The Parmesan chicken was not cooked well - it was like a giant gelatinous chicken nugget. The brick chicken didn't taste fresh. It was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste. I can't describe it but it was like the graininess of processed chicken. I really supported this place for over a year, but their quality has noticeably dropped. The salad was meager - I mean very small. The staff was profusely nice; the managers were very apologetic, but I begged them to understand that the quality of the chicken was just low - not their preparation.",

Ate at the one nearest us in Savannah and noticed the flavor and quality of my dinner (Pasta Rustica) was not up to par. Server said the new owners are all about the bottom line and are changing the recipes. Hello new owners; this is a recipe for disaster. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"   Decided to give them one more shot. Big mistake pigboy! The Carbonna was horrible, and that is as kind as I can get. Do they have a corporate taste kitchen? It was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat. A poached egg on top? Not the way to do it. Egg is an integral part of the recipe, not an add-on to pretend this is breakfast too. I tried to eat it but simply could not; even after dousing it with olive oil. There was no sauce; no moisture. Besides, the egg pasta was too thick.   Server did a good job. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious and, to her credit, comped my dinner and gave us a free desert. Class act.   But that was the last time. If you have patronized this place over the years before it was sold, you can now forget them. Do not waste your money.",

The food came out quickly but was still warm at best. I got the chicken scallopini and it was ok, other than the lack of heat. My wife got Mama's Trio. She didn't really care for any of it. I tried it and agree that none of it was very good, and also lukewarm.  The saving grace was that was that we had a gift card and didn't have to waste too much of our own money.
