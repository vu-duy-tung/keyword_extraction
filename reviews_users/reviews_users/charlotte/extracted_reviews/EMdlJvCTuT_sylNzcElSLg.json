The atmosphere is somewhat country club-esque with rich wood trims and place settings. Caricatures line the walls making things less stuffy.   As for the food, I had an amazing salad to start followed by the sea bass which was served over a heavy cream sauce. I finished with coffee and ended up taking home a piece of double chocolate flowerless cake for later. The cake was great by the way! In fact, the meal was great. I can't wait to visit again!",

    "text": "I may have to call this place my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  A friend and I decided to give this place a try during the CIAA tournament, since it's away from uptown.  We arrived around 7:30 pm for our 8 pm reservations and we were seated just a little after 8.  Before being seated we had a few drinks at the bar and took in some of the decor.  The walls  were covered with various caricatures of celebrities, I thought that was a pretty cool thing to decorate the walls with.  The overall decor is very inviting, I think they may have outdone Morton's and Ruth Chris.  The food was excellent.  I ordered an 18 oz new york strip and I must say it's one of the best cooked steaks I've had in Charlotte.  The seasoning was perfect and they got the temperature perfect for a medium-rare steak. The potato and cream of spinach sides were really awesome and I just couldn't get enough of the flour-less chocolate cake.  Service was great.  Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and patient.  She had no problems with answering our questions about the various cuts of meat, the sauces or the lobster sizes.  I don't have any negatives to report for this establishment and I will be returning many times in the future.  Just out of curiosity, I would like to see one of the 6 pound lobsters that our waitress told us about :)",

    "text": "If you are looking for a no muss, no fuss, excellently cooked steak, run to The Palm right now. I went for Summer Queen's Feast and I highly recommend it.  My plan all along was to have an All-American steak house meal. I started with the Caesar salad, which is not something I normally order, but I was pleased with the result. The romaine was crisp and sturdy, which showed that The Palm was not skimping on freshness or flavor just because it was restaurant week. There was a generous amount of cheese and croutons, which I am a huge fan of, and the Caesar dressing was creamy and slightly acidic and didn't drown my lettuce.  For my main I went with the obvious choice and ordered the twin tenderloin filet medallions. My steak hit the spot; it was perfectly rare in the middle, and had shallot butter generously melted on top (with some crispy onions as well). I love it when chefs have an in depth knowledge of meat temperatures (just talking about it is getting me excited) and whoever cooked my steak at The Palm definitely knew what they were doing.   The one downside about the restaurant week menu was that it did not include a side dish with our main courses; but for only $3 a person, we ordered a family style side of Brussels sprouts, which were almost as amazing as my steak. The Brussels sprouts were bathed in a delicious lemon brown butter; and the tanginess of the lemon, coupled with richness of the brown butter, perfectly offset the Brussels sprouts natural funkiness (or should we say bitterness? Sour taste?). I would eat those over and over again.  To complete my three course meal, I ended with the classic New York cheesecake (but stole a taste of my friend's Key Lime Pie, because I was having such a hard time deciding). The cheesecake was good; it was creamy, light (sometimes cheesecakes can turn dense), and not too sweet. But after a sort of heavy, on heavy, on heavy meal, I wasn't able to finish it all (it still made a great snack the next afternoon).

    "text": "Yes it is a chain but some chains are good!  The only reason I didn't give the Palm five stars is because YOU NEED A 6 OZ STEAK.  Us chicks can't handle 9 ounces!!!    I love the fillet - I get it with the Oscar option and I can't talk or think about anything else while I am eating it.  Perfectly cooked (I like medium-rare), perfectly seasoned (slightly salty!!), perfectly served in a little bit of au jus.  I had happy dreams for days....sigh....    The app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.  I love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper.  Such a perfect way to shovel the Palm butter into my pie-hole.    Service is excellent - fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the Palm.  Love it!  This location valet's which I recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop!  Can't wait for the next special occasion!!!!   :-D",

    "text": "As the other reviews stated, the bread basket was amazing. Out on a date, we ordered an appetizer, calamari, two entrees and two individual sized sides. We were stuffed!! The crab cakes were AMAZING. There was no filler, as many crab cakes have, and the salsa and chipotle sauce really complimented the dish. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium - as asked for). We had the cheesy potatoes, very rich, and the fried asparagus, really good.   The reason why this restaurant did not get five stars is because the service was often overbearing and I felt the sales pitch for their exclusive club was a little too forward. Also, their complementary valet service was staffed only by one guy and after waiting for about five minutes, we parked the car ourselves despite the rain. Their pricing was average for a steakhouse but a little bit high for the environment and service.   Tip: the last reservation/seating they take is 8 pm. A couple arrived just after us, like five minutes, and were not seated for dinner. I'm not sure this is a Sunday thing or what, but we were some of the only diners in the restaurant.",

    "text": "I love a good upscale steakhouse and the palm delivers. I have only eaten here twice and will base my review on the bar service/dining experience alone. I sat at the bar on a Sunday night with Shannon the best bartender. She is so personable and just great at her job.  If you go before 7 any day of the week the bar food is discounted to a very reasonable rate. I tried the lobster roll and the steak sliders. Both pretty delicious. We also tried the beer carpaccio off the regular menu because I love beef carpaccio. A lot. A whole lot. The regular diner menu is a bit pricey but that's to be expected with these types of establishments. The carpaccio was amazing and the arugala salad on top of it was delicious. With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own.   For dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes. But so good.   I loved this place and I will be back soon. Hopefully to sit in the dining room or at least give a steak a try!",

My steak came out over cooked, sent it back and they brought me a whole new dish cooked like I had ordered. It was just ok, for the same price we can get much better wet aged steaks that are much more full flavor at home.

    "text": "First/last time dining at The Palm in South Park. I have lived in Charlotte since 92' and dined at many of the reputable establishments in the area, except here. Even with my considerable amount of patience for bad servers (from my time serving throughout college) I was appalled by the service provided. Such a distasteful and negligent person to work in a place that charges a moderately high price for decently seasoned/prepared food. The reputation of this restaurant was certainly not accurate. No manager did table checks (or this wouldn't be in a review), our server blatantly told us she forgot to ring in our salad, felt my dress without asking awkwardly, laid silver down and explained it would \"be a long while before food would be available\", never was told the specials, had to tell her the ingredients in a French Martini 3 times. The worst part? I feel as if I was over 35 someone possibly would have asked how our experience had been and found this all out themselves, possibly tried to rectify the situation. When restaurants allow small children to run their business these things slip between the cracks. Filet bland, NY strip bland, server horrid (Hazize), ambiance questionable, $200 later a wasted date night. At one point we tried to ignore the service & food to enjoy each others company when a food runner dropped an entire entree on a nearby booth. With no shortage of amazing places around the SP area, no doubt our family will never relive the joke called \"The Palm\"",

That's the deal - good food, okay environment with fair sketches of middling local celebrities, stupid high prices.  But the point is that the food has to be PERFECT.  If I am going to pay $50 for a NY Strip, it needs to be cooked to order and done exactly correctly.  The problem with the meal we had last night is that it was just okay.  I had the caprese salad to start - it was $15 and consisted of two tomato slices (big, but flavorless) and buffala mozzarella (good not great).  My daughter had the bisque - flour-y and flavorless.  we had two NY strips and the prime rib.  The prime rib was HUGE and good.  The strips were okay - one was cooked medium well when ordered medium rare and one cooked correctly, but nothing much to it.  All in all, it was fine, the service was good, but without alcohol, the ticket was $200+ and for that money, it was not nearly good enough.  Gotta do better.",

    "text": "It's quite rare that hubs and I give a restaurant (or any business for that matter) varying star ratings. In fact, I really can't name one other business we've been to where our reviews span more than one star apart. Therefore, I'm surprised to say that, overall, The Palm didn't knock my socks off. Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.  The place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NC The occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversary The channel of reservation: Open Table The scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday evening  We made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn.   Our server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.  Beefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch.   Chilean Sea Bass: 3/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce.   Goat cheese whipped potatoes: 3/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up.   Creme brulee: 2/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered.   Other notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way.   Overall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me.",

I'm not one of them & hence the \"decor\" as such, was just oddball & not in a good way.  We went for happy hour & it's definitely an older crowd (I felt older there).  We sat at the bar & I guess we're spoiled by PPB across the way.  The bartender was ok, but was applying chapstick as she was taking our order which (we felt) was unprofessional.    We had the Chicken Parmesan Sliders which we really enjoyed.  I had the Beefsteak Tomato Capri...the tomatoes were ripe & large with a large slice of buffalo mozzarella & a drizzle of basil oil (so they said, but it was just olive oil).  He had the small Caeser salad & added chicken.  The salad didn't look so good, but I didn't tell my honey that.  The romaine lettuce wasn't fresh-looking & the chicken was very dry.  The dressing was tasty, but a little mayonnaise-y.  The waiters old-style waiter's coats are an atrocious tan color and just look sloppy instead of crisp.  They wear aprons underneath these boxy coats which doesn't make sense.    I'm so focused on the look and feel of the place because it was jarring to my senses.   You can tell this restaurant relies on their \"regulars\" because if you aren't one - you're probably not coming back after the first time.",

    "text": "Just can't see it for the money.  There are just too many other choices out there for this kind of money and even less.  Not quite sure what the target market is for this place.  Pricing, menu, and wait staff lean toward fine dining, but the place has the look and feel of theme joint.  We sat in a room with 6 tables, no less than 4 wait staff attending.  Five tables were dressed and well-mannered and one table, parents with what could have been twin girls late 20's early 30's, definitely sisters sitting with dad in a t-shirt, all loud, and I'm fairly certain, all drunk.  None of the staff said a word to these people even after the table behind us dropped a subtle hint to the waiter.   Sure, the food is better than most restaurants per-se, but for that amount of dinner bill, comparatively it isn't good at all.  I can name five places off the top of my head that are 3 times the food and 10 times the dining experience for the same or less.    I went specifically for the swordfish which l read on the trip advisor menu but wasn't on the actual menu.  No bother to update that menu to reflect current menu omissions.  I am however contributory to that since a little more research on my account would have turned up the online menu from their site which is up to date.    I settled for the veal martini which was fairly flavorful but over kill on the basil.  The veal was tough also.  My daughter had the filet.  She was struggling cutting it in which our waiter literally came over and cut it for her and he struggled a bit himself.   It was daughter's night out so I just let it go with a soft smile.   I'm not a filet person, but it is the only cut my wife and younger son order.   We were at Sullivan's and she just about cut her filet with her fork.  Capital Grille two weeks ago, my son, same thing.    I gave it a poor rating based on the demographics of the market.  For 58.00 my daughter has to get red faced because the waiter jumped in to help her cut her meat like a she's 6 years old. (She's 15; God forbid Dad help never mind the waiter) And for 42.00 my wife can cut hers with a fork and my son the same thing for 44.00 and neither place had loud rude people in t-shirts!  If a $48.00 probably choice cut filet, $9.50 quasi caesar salad, $13.00 asparagus, $36.00 tough veal dish, wasn't enough, I had two 8oz diet cokes at $4.25 each!  Hey guys, those other restaurants in your market; they refill your soft drink as a good will gesture because you chose to dine with them!",

The bar is small but still great service and they make an excellent goose and tonic Just about everything you order there is fantastic I have never had to send anything back ever. The parking there is sketchy at best it's improved a little bit since they built the parking deck in the back And it's nice if you have a fantastic dinner and have a lot of drinks you can stay at the Hampton Inn which is right next door before I moved to Charlotte I used to stay there and it was fantastic all the time what a great place to stay and just to have the palm right outside your hotel was a great convenience always went to the palm when I was in town Now that I live here I probably only go once every two years but I love it",

    "text": "Ok, so my review of the Palm in South Park is LONG overdue, I mean three girlfriend's in the past overdue. I visited in the spring of 2012. The day started with a Bark for Life walk off of Morrison in lovely South Park on a picturesque day with one beautiful blonde date, and culminated with another first date a petite, cute redhead at this location. To get right into it, I have to say, they gave us great service at the Palm. That's something you can't put a price on. I mean really good service. Imagine having butler service for three hours, and the butler is driving a Mercedes, so you know he takes his job seriously.  I met my date among a bustling crowd on a beautiful Saturday night.The waiter went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, and he was very attentive to our needs. I ordered the steak burger, it was very juicy, delicious, and bursting with flavor. It was an excellent portion size. The type of meat, we'll lets just say it was the expensive part of the cow, not rump roast. Unfortunately, I had only six bites of it because I had already eaten a sashimi appetizer at the Village Tavern in the Rotunda building in between dates. My date ordered the filet mignon, and it was delicious, cooked to perfection.  One goes to a place like the Palm for a special occasion, or like me for a blind first date on rare occurrences, but either way, you go for the service and the great food. They treated me like a king, and I will be back for sure. Come see how the other half lives at the Palm. It is sure to be a delight for you and your significant other. I wouldn't recommend the Palm for kids, unless they are very well behaved.",

The waiter asked if pink was ok and I could always send it back. So I had to, twice and then it was basically ruined. My med well to well was more medium to med rare. It was red, not pink. My husband ordered the linguini with clams and for $26 had very few clams and had to ask for more. We head been to Miro the previous night and I had twice the amount of pasta for less than he received.   We found the restaurant over priced and average for food.

They changed the rules so that the $7.00 lobster that they charge about $70.00 was taken away from the birthday gift. I  feel sure they lost more customers over this dumb move than they will ever get back. Then they try to re-charge you for a card you formerly had that was good from then on. Next they decided to resort to used car dealer tactics like slipping you a $14.00 glass of wine and upping it to $18. I was not a math major but 3 glasses at $18.00 and I could have bought 6 bottles of the 9 dollar wine at Total Wine The issue is the fast and slippery move from $14.00 glass to $18.00 glass feels cheesy. I was not expecting it from a place where I felt everybody knows your name. Friends don't let friends go to the Palm They have lost their way.",

Everything I've ever consumed there has been great - the crab cakes, lobster, filet, calamari, etc. The crab cakes are packed with crab meat. The whipped potatoes are some of the best I've had.  The best dessert are the donut holes! They're delicious! They remind me of the churros at Disneyland - perfect! Quite honestly, I love the chicken tenders and fries they have for kids, too!",

    "text": "Came here for Charlotte's Restaurant Week this week, where the price fixe everywhere is 30 bucks! Palm is the kind of place where that deal is worth it. The service was fine, although our server was a bit of the anxious type. I started with the mixed green salad, which was completely unmemorable. I say this because I literally had to go to the restaurant's website to figure out what the heck I ate for the first course. Apparently the mixed green salad. I vaguely remember the baby tomatoes.  However, we also had some sides as appetizers, which were truly phenomenal. The green beens were all oiled up with chunks of bacon in them. Wow. And the mashed potatoes were garlicky and very delicious.  For my second course, I had filet mignon medallions, which were also very good. I ordered them medium rare, and although the meat didn't quite \"melt\" with my knife like I wanted it to (perhaps due to the smaller size of the medallions), they were still quite tasty.  Apparently the Palm is known for its cheesecake, and I ordered that for dessert. Quite frankly, I'm used to every steak house having some sort of cheesecake, and they are all more or less good. But no. The Palm's cheesecake truly takes the cheesecake. It's HUGE and LOADED with sugar and a bunch of sweet fruit sauces are DUMPED ALL OVER IT. It was the best cheesecake I've eaten in years, possibly ever. I can't say for sure it was the best every, since clearly my memory is suspect, due to the fact that my memory of that mixed greens salad remains a little hazy...  Everything was washed down with two \"Strawberry Fields\" a sweet rum drink. It was fine. The beer list wasn't handy, and I didn't want to fill up on that.",

I decided to go there for Thanksgiving dinner this year, as there were only two of us, and it's not worth the mess to cook for two. This wasn't my first choice, but Sullivan's was not available. The Palm had a Thanksgiving menu, or the regular menu was available. Both of us went Thanksgiving. The first course was great:  I had the arugula & apple salad, and my girlfriend had the lobster bisque.  Both were excellent. Second course was the main entree:  sliced turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy, plus our choice of veggie.  We had whipped potatoes and green beans. Everything was very good. The last course was dessert, which we got to go.  The choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie.  We both chose the pecan pie. At home later that evening, we learned that this dessert was nothing more than store-bought pumpkin pie with chocolate chips pressed into the top.  The crust was awful, and had the tell-tale pattern of a machine-made pastry. Really?! I am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef.  I left The Palm in L.A. with a piece of carrot cake that was worth fighting over (or at least arm wrestling).   You are not getting out of The Palm for less than $75 per person.  I was shocked that was the best they could do.  Added frustration:  Thanksgiving is the day that everyone from age 80-120 has dinner at The Palm.  It is impossible get from A to B outside or inside the place.   We'll go elsewhere in the future.",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant multiple times.  We use Open Table to book reservation on-line, so this restaurant has our history of what what type of table preference we like, our waiter/waitress request, and previous order history (...if there's a special drink we like a certain way).  Knowing that, this restaurant is consistent and rarely misses a beat.  My last visit was their King Crag legs and  were a generous portion, sweet and flavorful....My new favorite, since I'm not always a red meat fan.  Their Monday night salad is excellent, and should be tried...Its a chopped salad that is very tasty and different from the typical leafy type salad or wedge salad.  I took off 1 star, and because we have a history of going there, for some reason the familiar staff needs to feel like they have to entertain or visit us.  Because this is a special occasion restaurant, we like to go and enjoy each others company, without the intrusion of the staff visiting or socializing with us.  We go for a nice dinner with good service and would prefer just that.    Oh...If your not a member of the 937 Club, it is well worth the investment.  we have acquired many points and The Palm is always stirring up some yummy creative specials.    Overall, this is one of our favorite places to dine.",

My favorite is the little one with the raisons (don't be afraid of it, it's amazing!). I had the shrimp cocktail and nearly killed myself with the horseradish because I wasn't sure how hot it was! That was fun. The salads are also fantastic. I was given a happy birthday card which all of the staff signed. How sweet! Oh, it was also nice having dinner across from the Joker.",

Basically, I like most all of the high end joints so, it's a close race but after my second Palm visit, I have to give it up to them.    My wife and I took her parents and her sister there last night as one of her dad's birthday presents.  Everyone was very happy with all they ate.  Detail wise, I'll stick to just my meal for this review.  Took advantage of one of the summer specials and went with the Filet and Lobster tail.  This also came with a choice of a starter and a side and yes, of course I super-sized the steak and tail once I found out I could!  For the starter I had the lobster bisque which was poured table side.  It was hot, creamy and delicious although it did require the addition of a tad bit of salt at the table.  The steak came cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a great crust on it and the lobster tail was as big as my head and very moist and flavorful.  Had the three cheese potatoes au gratin for the side.  It was cheesy and good though it also benefited from a wee bit of table-side salt.  Service was once again friendly and impeccable and they are very accommodating to various special requests.  Can't wait to go back next time!",

    "text": "Unfortunately my first visit to The Palm was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I'm not one to write negative reviews, but this was just that bad. Firstly, the service was pretty good. Certainly not excellent, but it was good. Myself and two girlfriends ordered a bottle of wine, which was excellent, but that's where it stopped. We ordered several appetizers that were awful. The tuna was not fresh and after each of us had a bite we didn't eat it. The same goes for the calamari which was rubbery and extremely salty- the \"marinara\" was cold and flavorless. We wondered if they had just opened a can of tomatoes and put them in a dish. The lobster mac and cheese was awful as well. Luke warm, the pasta was over cooked and the was NO lobster at all in the dish. To say the least, we expected much more from a fine dining restaurant with prices like these. After the awful apps we didn't dare order an entree. Lastly, after dinner we went to the restroom where there was a man in there cleaning. We asked if we could enter and he replied \"that's up to you\". We obviously waited outside of the door while he continued to clean. Why wouldn't he stop what he was doing to allow us to enter, then continue when we left?? After we were made to wait about 5 min, we entered the restroom and a few min later he knocked on the door, opened it, and asked if we were done. I was touching up my makeup since we where headed somewhere else for drinks because we were ready to leave. I immediately left the restroom and we left the restaurant. To say the least we were all shocked at how bad this experience was.",

    "text": "I went again this last week, and it stepped way up two levels since last time, so I am upgrading my last review from 3 to 5 stars :-) Keep up the great work!  I will try to come back again soon.  Previous review:  I mostly enjoyed my initial visits at this branch of the Palm, and especially the concept of the 3 course lunch meals.  Some of the food was awesome, but there is room for improvement in the kitchen, as not everything coming out of the kitchen is consistent and right.  The chicken parmesan should be further tenderized, served flatter, and not served as bigger chunks of chicken.  Also, the breading did not stick very well to the chicken, was kind of mushy, and really fell apart when trying to eat it.   Something was just not right or careful in traditional Palm spirit in the prep.  Also, the baked clams were a bit over cooked on one visit and dried out and darkened/blackened too much from the broiler.  However, they were very tasty and perfectly prepared on another visit.  They also forget to serve the clam forks on one visit, which was a surprising miss.   A final opportunity is the iced tea.  It was absolutely fresh and excellent one time around the holidays and on the next visit when we came in for an early lunch seating on a slower day, it was cloudy, bitter, strong, and stale tasting. Maybe not changed from a previous day or days, or possibly just made poorly?   On the other hand, pickles, bread, and especially the salad with Russian dressing all tasted great across our visits.  The steaks were done nicely too...  Desserts also pleased.  However, I do expect the fine traditional Italian offerings and things like the iced tea to be better and more consistent each time.  The great Russian salad and the Italian food are the biggest drivers of why I visit the chain, so they need to be great to keep me coming and sometimes travelling very long distances to dine here.  I would hope to see my feedback used for significant execution improvement from the kitchen paying attention to the details, so it is a lot better next time. The service varied a little from great to good in terms of attentiveness, but great and attentive every time would be much better.  I really want them to succeed and be awesome in the Palm tradition.  I will come as much as I can, if they do keep stepping up.  They just need to work a little more to not slip or drop the ball some days, especially when the pace is slower...   When visiting different Palm branches recently, I give the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills Palm restaurants an A and A+ respectively.  I went to the Beverly Hills branch 3 times on one long weekend visit because it was so great.   Boston gets an A to A-.  Washington D.C. unfortunately did not even pass for me last time, but I may try again some day soon to see if they step up their game and can improve, as their management does seem to be very engaged and trying to do great.  Charlotte may be an A some days but a B- or lower others.  If they can tune things and get more consistent, I believe they can be an A all the time.  They just need to step it up a bit more across the board...",

    "text": "I have heard great things about the Palm and I think it is somewhat of a staple here in Charlotte but I have to say it honestly didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. I think your experience will depend upon your reasoning for choosing this restaurant.. For example, we chose this to celebrate our anniversary and it just didn't satisfy me.  It was rather loud in the restaurant in general, the hostess was friendly but nothing special, it wasn't romantic and they really didn't do anything to make you feel like you were a special guest.  We were seated in a private room initially so I was excited and hopeful.  However, our bread had not hit the table before another couple was seated RIGHT beside us.  Then, within 30 minutes 2 more tables were occupied including a family of 5.  The kids were like toddlers--WHY are they in there?  Moving on...the waitress was super friendly, her \"assistant\" didn't speak english but she was helpful.  The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and really knew the menu quite well.  She even suggested a few things that were not listed on the menu.  I liked the fact that they offered 9 oz pours for the wine and they had a pretty extensive wine variety.    My husband ended up ordering the Filet and I ordered the crab cakes because I was told these are their house specialty!  We ordered the goat cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli for our sides.    I thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes.  Were they worth almost $40?  Not even close.  It was three small little crab clusters.  They were void any fillers which I appreciated and packed with good quality crab meat.  They were great but not worth taking out a loan over..    The steak my husband ordered was decent but again nothing special.  The flavoring that they recommended he try was a peppercorn/olive oil sauce.  The steak honestly shouldn't need this additional flavoring but it did in this case.  It was a little chewy and it didn't melt in your mouth!  It was not flavored well on its own.  I honestly think a Ruth Chris' steak is much better!  Again, this just wasn't worth the $50 it cost.  The sides were good although there was nothing about the potatoes that tasted like goat cheese...they were just very good and creamy mashed potatoes.  The broccoli had great flavor and was cooked perfectly--not too crunch and not soggy--just how I like it!  We didn't have time for dessert (catching a play uptown) but their menu looked decent.  We were told to try their donuts.  I'm sure they are good.  I think it would have been nice if they offered a free dessert or something special because it was our anniversary.    Roundup?  I expected more, especially for the price point.  I'm telling you I can go into Ruth's or Sullivans or Terra and many other restaurants that are not as expensive and have a better overall dining experience.  I can't figure out why someone would choose the Palm over all the other great steakhouses in the area.  They are more expensive and offer less quality and a worse environment.  I wouldn't come back.",

Our excellent server, Melissa, mentioned the availability of prime rib and we instantly changed our plans from appetizers to a full dinner.  Shared appetizers were clams casino and calamari fritti. The clams were nice; but, the calamari was outstanding - tender as could be, lightly breaded, red and yellow pepper strips were scattered throughout - a nice counterbalance.  The prime rib was shared by two of us and was felt in your mouth delicious. And, for me, my real favorite, as always, the creamed spinach.  For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake and warm doughnuts were the perfect ending.  The wine, a Buckhorn cabernet, was excellent as were the cocktails.  But, the real highlight of the evening was the service. All of the staff was wonderful; but, Melissa was outstanding - her description of the food and the wine was sheer perfection, worthy of a slot on the Food Channel - so very descriptive!  An excellent evening on all counts!  Visited May 2015",

Food is way over buttered, greasy. Management a total crock. Servers are well trained and try to make up for all the B.S. Don't waste your money or gain 10 lbs. by visiting this over hyped \"joint\". I lived in Manhattan during the original Palm Restaurant days. Sawdust on the floor, no pretension. Just good food at affordable pricing. So much so that they opened Palm II to handle the spillover of customers. So they got bought out by a restaurant group who spent a lot on hype. We don't intend to set foot in a Palm again. Nor do family and friends who have had similar experiences at Palm CHAINS throughout the country.",

Thankfully, I have researched most anniversary meals and faired well based on reviews. Tonight, we decided to eat my wife's uncle's favorite restaurants, despite the reviews. Granted he passed 10 years ago, as did their love for providing a top notch dinning experience, apparently. Tonight was the worst anniversary dinner by far, possibly top 5 worst dinners in the 18 years my wife and I have been together. Between the two of us we may have taken 14 bites from 7 plates. They did take off the \"prime\" rib eye that was like a brick. I can expand on every dish we ordered but honestly just would rather not.   I don't speak out against businesses often, but The Palm is apparently putting a bad taste in many diners mouths these days.",

Those big-boys just don't taste all that well to start with, and it was not expertly cooked, either.  The side of Brussels' sprouts were touted as al dente; however, it was tough to fork them off the plate.  My wife's lobster bisque was the highlight and my Caesar salad was bland and lifeless (although they did give ample portions of anchovies).  Beyond the heavy decor and the shtick of getting your caricature painted on the wall if you spend a lot, the most disappointing part of the evening was the table side \"pitch\" to join the 837 Club.  Really?!?  I just laid out $200 and your idea of a wonderful close to the meal before dessert is to present me a brochure and encourage me to join a dinner club?  I could not have been more surprised and for a moment thought I was flying coach on US Airways on my way back from Cancun.  Imagine my greater surprise that I was pitched again AFTER dessert, too.  Yes, they did (and no, I'm not joining)!  Lastly, we made our reservations through Open Table, which was honored.  I made comments on their site that this was our 37th anniversary.  I was not looking for a freebie or clapping or a cupcake, but it would have been nice if they acknowledged it to my wife.  For all the hype and price, Palm Restaurant needs to rattle a few coconuts at this location.",

The hostess who thinks she's guarding Queen Elizabeth and must condescend every guest, to the server who pops up every half hour or so but still feels entitled to a 25% tip... you'll find them both here, next to some of the best steaks in the Queen City. If you can get past the tired, dated ambiance which is badly in need for a makeover, you will still get a great meal provided you aren't expecting the service that accompanies visits at the city's other premier steakhouses.",

So my husband and I ordered a five pound lobster. What we got was a three pounder at best. The split tail was a scrawny piece of meat. I'm sure that the detached claws that were brought with the tail were not parts of the same lobster. We will not be bringing clients here for sure. This Palm does not live up to the other Palms in NY. Go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I recently visited the Palm for my birthday and can say I was impressed with both the food and service.   We made reservations and arrived beforehand to enjoy a drink in the bar. The bar was packed with others enjoying cocktails and appetizers.  We were seated in a corner, not the greatest table, but were addressed for water, tap, sparkling, etc. and a bread basket of fresh breads from Great Harvest.  After reviewing the menu, we started with the crab cake and shrimp appetizer. The crab cake was AMAZING! Jumbo lump crab with very little filling served with a mango salsa on the side. The shrimp was butterflied and breaded and then dredged in a mustard sauce, good, but didn't stand up to the crab cake. As for our entrees, I went with the 9 oz. filet and added a 1/2 lobster tail, for their surf and turf option and my guest got the Prime Rib special. We ordered Brussel Sprouts to share. The filet melted in my mouth, one of the best I have ever had. As for the lobster, would probably pass next time. A little overcooked for me.  The Prime Rib was also amazing and served a great homemade horseradish dip.  No comment on the brussel sprouts, just ok.  Being my birthday we ordered the flourless chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Unfortunately they forgot it was my birthday, although I was told they made them aware when the reservations were made. The cake was good, but a little too rich for me. Throughout the night the service was spot on, even though the restaurant was packed. I was surprised to see a lot of guests, from families, to couples, etc.  I guess it is more of a go to spot than I thought. Overall we enjoyed our dinner and would definitely come back for another special occasion, especially with the price. Ha Ha!",

While they were accurate it had been changed to fix the error sometime during dec 31 that is hardly helpful...   I found this out by refreshing the browser - it was updated sometime between this morning and tonight - during same day, and was disappointing to those who had made dinner reservations any time prior to the 31st, and were shocked to be told there is no ny Eve special here at this location (as if we were in error!!!) and they would not honor the special...

First we ordered a couple of glasses of prosecco while we decided what we wanted. We both settled on the 9oz filet. I requested mine medium rare, while the other was medium. Mine was a True medium rare, juicy and pink  in my opinion, perfect. We had Caesar salads, three cheese mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. Now, normally I wouldn't order creamed spinach, but I am SO glad we did, it was INCREDIBLE! I recommend you get it. We then enjoyed dessert, carrot cake and cheesecake, both were incredible! We had a fantastic experience for Valentine's Day and plan to return soon! Thanks Palm Staff for making our visit incredible!",

    "text": "Two complaints: 1) I was told to wait at the bar or the lounge and that when the rest of my party came I would be notified and we would be seated.  This didn't happen.  I sat at the bar drinking and my party waiting for me and texted me and I had my phone on silent.  They waited at least 15 minutes for me the whole time I am at the bar wondering why they are taking so long.  I end up texting them to ask where they are and they tell me they are seated and wondering where I am.  Making four people wait on me is embarrassing and frustrating.  It also makes the night run late.  2) The half lobster in my surf and turf was overcooked and dry.  Not a little, but a lot.  I would have sent it back and really complained it should never have been plated it was so obviously bad.  I was with a party of people and in those cases I just eat it.  I ate some of it and someone at the table asked to try my lobster and I was glad to be rid of it.  They said it was dry too and gave the rest back to me.  This brings up a why didn't I complain and then I have to explain I didn't want to make a scene.  Well there is a scene made now and I didn't even get decent lobster because of it.  The lighting is way too dark and I could barely see anyone.  The positives: The waitstaff - David was my waiter and I think David is excellent.  Not good, not proficient - excellent.  He had been there for years and knew everything.  I asked for my bread to be heated so the butter would melt - I am a weirdo and I don't like seeing un-melted butter on my bread.  The waiter understood me on the first request and very quickly took the bread and brought it back exactly how I like it.  The steak - the steak was done exactly as I wanted it.  It was a rib-eye and if you are bored and look at my other reviews I am all over Charlotte eating rib-eye steaks.  I try to eat them medium rare and that is a difficult way to cook a rib-eye and render all the fat.  Not a problem for the palm.  The drinks - whenever I got a drink (EtOH, ethanol aka alcohol) it was right.  Nothing was wrong - just the right amount of ingredients, salt and or sugar not too thickly crusted and not too thinly crusted.  The bartenders weren't excellent like the waiter.  Someone (not me) with me spilled her glass of wine.  She got very little on me, a moderate amount on herself, and a good bit on the bar.  Nobody came by to help us with the spill.  Nobody asked if we wanted a replacement (comp or paid).  This was a chance to shine.  The bar height is a bit off for women so your arms are in the wrong position or angle when seated so you may be prone to spill.  I might go back, but at this price I don't want to have to send something back.  I am spendthrift and the few times each month we go to a place like this we want it to be perfect.  If the Palm can be that place I would go back, but I am really not satisfied with what I consider two poor quality mess-ups.",

We celebrated Valentine's Day early here and had a fabulous meal consisting of filet mignon, wild mushrooms and creamed spinach. Unfortunately my meat wasn't cooked to my exact liking, but was still great.   We also ordered cocktails that were fabulous, as always. Their drinks are on a different level than their food. Always phenomenal!  Wish the bar area was bigger.   Unfortunately we were both too full for dessert. Our waiter, Mike, was super friendly and knowledgeable. Hoping to come back sooner rather than later!",

My friends and I made reservations for 7:30, when we arrived they greeted us and said they were just waiting for our table to be cleared and to hang out at the bar until it was ready. So we headed to the bar and were seated about 10 minutes later.   The first cool thing about this place is the caricatures on the wall, there  famous and some local faces with their names and even some signature everywhere you looked! I thought this was a very cool touch!  Once seated we were presented with one of the most amazing bread baskets I've seen. But keep in mind, I'm totally a bread lover! There was a white, wheat and whole grain, sweet cinnamon and even breadsticks! It's a bread lovers dream.   The menu looked absolutely delicious, I ordered the lobster bisque, jumbo lump crab cakes and mango salsa and key lime pie for dessert.  The lobster bisque was divine! It was creamy and rich. The only thing I wanted was more lobster! Other than that it was one of the best I've tasted! But make sure they add some cracked pepper for more flavor!   The jumbo lump crab cakes were absolutely amazing.  Literally overwhelmed with crab meat...OH MY GOODNESS. I really don't have another way to describe it, they were outstanding! The mango salsa was really fresh and worked as a great compliment with the meal.  They key lime pie was great too! A great and refreshing way to end the meal.   This place was really great! Our server was wonderful and we had a lovely time. Look forward to returning!",

I had their filet mignon and my aunt had their chicken Parmesan-I highly recommend going with someone who will do halfsies with you so you can get both at once!

The restaurant had both tables and booth style seating.  You could also sit outside on their patio on a nice day/evening.   Started with a bottle of Cabernet.  Nice wine glasses - something I appreciate.  Crab cakes as an appetizer were unbelievable.  Not sure there was any \"cake\" as it was all crabmeat.  Caesar salad was very nice as well - not too heavy on the dressing.  The meal was excellent.  The filet was cooked exactly as ordered.  The potatoes au gratin were likely the best I have ever had.  Chicken Parmigiana was also ordered at the table.  A nice sized serving.  Took the desert to go as I was too full to even try.    I would definitely come again. I had a very nice evening. Oh, and they have valet parking for your convenience.  Enjoy!",

I ordered the filet as my main dish as well as the others at my table. I ordered mine medium and they ordered theirs well done. My steak was over cooked and so was theirs. The sizes of the steaks were also varied and didn't offer much in size. The steak also didn't have any flavor. It was quite the ordeal to get the steak orders correct and we never received our side dishes. We had to request them. The other main dish offers (salmon and chicken) both looked delicious and were nice portions. The side dishes were ok. They had good flavor but nothing to write home about. The prefix dessert was cheesecake with a raspberry sauce. It was a nice size and came with a side of whipped cream.   I ordered the Kentucky Mule as a suggestion from our server. It was amazing! It's not on the menu but I'm glad she suggested it. It was a prefect mix of bourbon and ginger beer.   Overall I wasn't impressed by the food at the Palm. I know I didn't have much choice in the items I tried and that it was a large group and that that can be difficult.   I do have say the service was great and I did feel like our group was well taken care of.  The Palm 6705-B Phillips Pl Ct, Charlotte, NC 28210 Sunday April 14, 2019 6:30pm",

I really just thought maybe it was a bad first time but turns out The Palm just isn't that great. The meat doesn't taste like prime meat. It doesn't have that melt in your mouth, cut it with a butter knife taste or texture. The salad tasted like it had vinegar drizzled over it, ruining the entire thing. The spinach was just spinach, nothing special. The au gratin potatoes were not good at all, probably the worst I've ever had. There's so many other options around to get a good cut of meat that I wouldn't recommend wasting your money here.",

Fun lil spot with caricatures of all of the famous people that have visited adorning the walls. Very friendly encounters from valet to the table. The staff was very nice! Jose our waiter was attentive but we could tell he was very busy. Drink from the bar took about 20 mins only to end up sending it back because it was the wrong one. We needed to add a touch of salt to all the sides as well as the soup. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY! Crab cakes were great too! So overall it was a pretty good dining experience. We're thinking that maybe if we went on a less crowded night we would've gotten a 4/5 star service. We'd try it again for sure!",

We didn't have to get our hands dirty trying to break the claws..  The sea bass what 2 people on our group ordered was very rubbery. Doesn't taste fresh. She exchange for a salmon. It was ok. When it finally arrive. Most of us were 3/4 way thru our food. So that didn't impress our group.  I enjoyed my steak which is a 22oz bone in rib eye. I was able to share it with some friends and they all enjoyed it.  Sides: garlic roast whipped potatoes (yum), Brussels sprout was good. Not over cook nor undone. Green beans was ok. No flavor.

    "text": "On July 2, my husband had dinner reservations scheduled at the palm to celebrate my birthday. Well, interestingly, the general manager, Joey was standing outside with the valet. No one opened my door showing me they didn't want us to get out the car but the valet guy was there. Then Joey mentioned my husband's name so he knew we had a reservation. We were late and it appears he wanted to punish us for being late on a Tuesday night! He didn't offer that we come in since the restaurant was still open and so was the bar. It was clear he didn't want us to come in. Joey's approach and that of the valet were not welcoming. As joey was walking away towards the entrance door, another couple walked up to the door and Joey opened the door for them and immediately ushered them right in without a conversation. That is the moment the alleged kitchen being closed got me thinking.  So, I know he didn't tell them \"the kitchen was closed\".  When I called the restaurant few days later to discuss the situation, I made it clear I don't want a free meal or anything in return as that is not my motive.  I spoke with Joey and he told me that the couple was just going to the bar. RIGHT! Interesting, he never offered us to come in and how did he assume he didn't have to tell them the kitchen was closed and how did they know the kitchen was closed because Joey never stopped them or had a conversation with them as they walked in. Joey lied in our follow up conversation saying he had a 2 minute conversation with the couple he ushered in after us and told them the kitchen was closed. I told him bro, that's a lie because I could see and hear him and he never said anything to them the whole time. Not going to assume what the difference in treatment was due to.   It was a terrible experience that clearly showed he didn't want us to even step foot inside. I asked the valet what time the restaurant closed and he began to babble as if he didn't want to co-sign on a lie. He seemed confused. I won't patronize them! We then went to one of my favorite restaurants after that horrible experience but Joey wasn't going to mess up my night. It's sad that a general manager can behave this way to customers because that shows what the culture of palm is!",

    "text": "Of all the overpriced restaurants in Charlotte, this comes the closest to actually being worth it. I eat here about once or twice a month for work or with family, and have never been disappointed.   I'm surprised by the reviews that say the service is bad. I'm a pretty tough critic of service and am usually impressed with the folks here. They know the menu, generally recognize us, are friendly and unpretentious, and have some personality. To me, the wait staff is a strong point. In particular, I like that they treat my nine year old daughter as well when I come in on a Saturday as they do my clients when I bring them during the week. If my wife and I want to have a relaxed burger at the bar, the service is as good as if we're getting a pricey steak in the main dining room.   The drinks are among the best in town. The vodka martini is strong and not watered down, and the wine selection is very acceptable.   The food is very consistently good. Steaks are as good as anywhere in town. The salads, particularly the blue cheese wedge, is great. The lobster bisque is awesome. The desserts are outstanding, particularly the cheese cake. If you don't want to spend a ton, the cheeseburger is super.   I think the atmosphere is a strong plus too. Old school and dark without being fussy or uncomfortable.   I'd pick it over any steakhouse in town as my \"go-to\" any day. Beef n Bottle is equally good in its own way, but it's a very different kind of place. Del Frisco's, Fleming's, etc. may look fancier, but they're a step below the Palm, which is always cozy and enjoyable.",

Even if my steak medallions weren't delicious (which they were!!), I'd keep coming back for her incredible service and \"real\" conversation.  What a treat!  Back to my steak... I'm a horrible person and eat my beef medium-well; it was cooked perrrrfectly!  It was still tender and juicy.  The mashed potatoes were heavenly and seasonal vegetable (broccoli) was very flavorful.. Yes, broccoli can have flavor!!  Then you have drinks and dessert... I had a couple \"Seasonal Mules.\"  It's currently fresh blueberries muddled with Grey Goose - Where else can you get a Goose-heavy beverage for $11?!  No where near South Park, that's for sure! And the key lime pie... Don't say no!  Not overly sweet, not too much lime, and the crust isn't perfect.  So, you know it's home or locally made - which is what makes it perfect!  If you're willing to splurge a little bit for a 5-Star local lunch, this is your place!  Great location, great food, supeeeerb service... will definitely return :-D",

    "text": "You know what to expect when you go to the Palm: excellence. Tonight lived up to it.   We arrived before our friends so we enjoyed a cocktail at the bar. I let the server pick for me and she didn't steer me wrong. A pomegranate martini kicked off the evening on a great start. Sweet, but not too sweet, it was so tasty. Hubby had a Long Island Iced tea and was also pleased. So pleased he had another one at the table.   Our server was amazing. With over 20 years of experience, he was attentive and guided us to perfect selections. I started with lobster bisque. It was perhaps the most smooth bisque I have ever had.  One word comes to mind: silk. There were ample pieces of almost minced sweet lobster. If the remainder of the night would be like this bisque, I was in for a treat.   Our server informed us that the Palm's crab cakes have been voted the best for 20 years. How could I resist? I can tell you that they've earned this distinction. Lump, sweet crab meat with absolutely no filler left me wondering what was holding these massive crab cakes together. My friends had joked while we were waiting that my THREE crab cakes would probably be the size of quarters. They were wrong! I was pleasantly surprised at how large all three crab cakes were. Score!   For sides, our table chose lobster Mac and cheese, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. I was too stuffed to try the potatoes but the creamed spinach was very good as was the lobster Mac and cheese. Be warned, there is bacon in the lobster Mac and cheese so after two bites, I had to let that go.   Too full for dessert, we had to pass on a burnt caramel brownie that our server said was to die for. Maybe next time.",

    "text": "The Palm never disappoints, as long as you know what you're going for:  impeccable service, classy yet unstuffy atmosphere, fabulous food and a price tag to match.  We usually go just for special occasions.  Like once a year anniversary.  Our wait staff was excellent as always - all 3 of them (plus the GM, who has been there forever and welcoming as ever).  Never got below a half glass of tea or water, never a finished/dirty dish on the table for more than a minute, and the only times they were noticed was when they were bringing casual, relevant and delightful conversation.    The Monday Night Chop-Chop Salad is my favorite dish here for many years, along with the crab cake.  Never had another chopped salad or crab cake to match.   I request the salad with no dressing but balsamic on the side - and it wins every time.   The crab cake I've tried to duplicate at home, but lose every time.  It's 91% lump crab meat and 9% diced mango -  magically held together with NOT BREAD but love and tenderness and unparalleled cuisine perfection.    My sweet hubby ordered filet, unfortunately a bit underdone for his taste.  Surprising, since he's had this cut /  heat at the Palm almost every time we go and it's typically cooked spot on, but this time, just a tad too pink.    The only disappointment came with the lobster mac and cheese.  It was a ginormous serving of mac and cheese, but unfortunately he said nothing special.  He ate several bites and never encountered even a hint of lobster.  And this boy knows his lobster (his 2nd favorite dish at the Palm).   He returned it and was given his choice of sides, so stuck with the safe cottage fries, which were ok.   I mean, how wonderful can fried potatoes be... when you're paying $15 for half a potato.    Even after having to send a dish back.  Oh, they have sweet tea now.  Which hubby appreciated.  If you are a regular at the Palm, I know you love it.  If you've never been, please try it.  Just be fully aware of the price tag before you go.    Thank you to our wait staff last night - you were beyond measure.  We'll be back.  Next year. xo",

Tremendous value for $30 per person.  Many have commented on the crab cakes, and indeed they are full of crab meat and little filling.  However, this is still a Steakhouse in my opinion and they do them right.  The cuts are always very high quality and the preparation to your exact specifications.    The sides here are generous and to be shared.  The desserts always good.  Lastly, I have always had outstanding service in NY and Charlotte did not disappoint.",

    "text": "Late afternoon dinner at the Palm... I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes, but we gave them some time to realize there were customers up front. After someone in the kitchen finally noticed us, we were seated at a table, with no menus... Then, our waiter introduced himself, took away extra silverware, and gave us no menus. We asked... Should we get out own menus? He said he would get us some. He then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view. Since the restaurant was almost completely empty, it looked like we were interrupting a break. After several minutes of chit-chat, the waiter finally delivered some menus (how hard is that?). Perusing the menu, it was clear the Palm doesn't believe in meals, which I guess is because meals are... gauche. You can order a steak for $45, but you won't get a salad or a side unless you buy a separate $8 plate of veggies or $8 salad. I just couldn't believe a 9 oz. piece of meat would be worth that much (plus, I'd rather a 6 oz. filet). So, we ordered the Veal and Chicken Parm. (~$35), which do not come with any noodles unless you pay $4 extra (thus bringing the Parms. up to ~$40). I also ordered a coffee, which was just OK, and asked for a bread basket, which was room temperature and less enjoyable than the Mimi's bread basket. On the plus side, the entrees were excellent, and had there been half as much Chicken Parm., a vegetable, and some well-prepared noodles or potatoes, I wouldn't have felt so ripped off. As is, two chicken breasts was way too much chicken and too little fine dining. In addition, the lighting in the restaurant was not very romantic/intimate, and there was a noticeable lack of ambiance. We managed to escape from the restaurant for $110 total (no salads, no desserts, no alcohol), for a meal that was less enjoyable than many $60 meals ($30 per person) we've enjoyed at other restaurants (with at least 1 salad, 1 dessert, and 1 glass of wine). If someone else had been paying the bill, I had ordered the lacking sides, and I had never seen the price, I may have had a better experience, but the service and ambiance still were nothing to write home about.

I understand it was close to closing time, so I don't mind or care that my bartender was busy closing up shop... But on the other hand, this is an upscale place and would have been nice to experience the exceptional.  I ordered the lobster salad sliders.  It was good.  The 3 little things was enough to fill me up as late dinner.  There's enough lump lobster meat (can always have more) and the arugula adds a nice flavor. The crispy potato chips was a great edible garnish.  I also ordered a mojito from their classic cocktails menu.  Unfortunately that was not good.  It was so tart I could taste the lime AFTER my meal as I was on my way home.  Is it so hard to find a good mojito in Charlotte?  I just expected their classics to be solid choices, oops.   I will be back, I have my eyes on the crabcakes. But next time I will not be ordering any drinks that has any lime juice in it...I just had a chill thinking of that mojito.    Side note: I just remember that they serve their drinks with a custom stirrer in the shape of a palm tree... You know how rare that is?  My aunt used to collect them, when each hotel/lounge/bar had their own design.",

I tried to contact the Manager but so far they have been radio silent.  We spent $142 on lunch for 4 people, and expected the service to match.

    "text": "Calling this place an Italian restaurant is a misnomer.  It's really just a steak house, so prepare yourself for lots of meat!    I arrived here for a business dinner around 6:30.  My entire party had not arrived, so I decided to hang out at the bar.  My coworker and I were by far the youngest at the bar (and he's in his 30's)!  Think old guys in suits with white hair drinking Glenlivet....  Not necessarily a bad thing, but probably not the best spot you'd like to take a date.  We were promptly seated at a booth, and the hostess, waitress, and busgirl were all extremely pleasant and polite.  The waitress had some great recommendations as well, she knew her stuff.  One of the guys eating with me was a wine snob, so we got some outrageously expensive bottle of Cabernet to begin with.  It was delicious, but geez!  I had the tomato capri (which really was just a caprese salad) which was really delicious and the mozzarella was very creamy and yummy.  My colleagues had the lobster bisque soup (which they seemed to enjoy very much) and the tomato and onion salad, which was also very well prepared.  3 of us ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon (which no one finished by the way, I wouldn't recommend anything bigger unless you are a big eater).  It had a wonderful flavor, and was VERY well prepared.  A great steak.  Not that it shouldn't have been, considering JUST the steak (no sides mind you) cost $34.  For sides, we had the fried asparagus, sauteed green beans, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, and sauteed mushrooms.  They all tasted great, but considering the price of each side (approx $10) the portions were VERY small.  Finally we had the cheesecake!  It was from some famous bakery in Jersey, though the name of it escapes me at the moment.  Very fresh, and delicious.  So why only 4 stars?  1.  Decor - They have painted faces on the wall of all of the celebrities that have dined there, and it's extremely tacky looking. 2.  Price - For the cost, I just didn't see the value.  The steak was the best I've ever had, but that was the only thing that was phenomenal about this crowd.  The bill was $500+ with tip, so beware. 3.  The Crowd - It's kind of old and dowdy in there.  I was the youngest person in the place, and also one of the only females dining there.  Great place for a business dinner, but I might go elsewhere if looking for a place to dine with family or friends.",

    "text": "The week my fourth baby was due I was really craving a big steak so, for what was possibly my last meal, my husband and I headed to The Palm. The service was incredibly attentive - from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Everyone was nice but no cloyingly so or with any sort of uppity attitude that often accompanies a restaurant with prices this high.   I have to admit that I have a problem making decisions and when I ask my server for a suggestion I really am interested in their opinion. Our server was fantastic and did not hesitate to be the \"decider\" when I was torn between 2 choices. I ordered a wedge salad with bleu cheese and Bacon (delish) after toying with the idea of lobster bisque. Although I intended to eat steak, the seafood options on the menu looked amazing. I convinced my husband to order blackened mahi mahi and I ordered a petit filet with the intent of creating our own surf and turf plate. We also ordered mushrooms as a side. Wow. Highly recommend. I must say that the only part of the meal that was less than spectacular was the steak! It was not seasoned at all. Nothing special. Next time I am craving a steak I will certainly head to Del Friscos.  Overall a nice experience but I'm not sure I'll be heading back anytime soon.",

But still quality meat so no complaints. They do push to pad the bill but I knew it and accepted so shame on me. Will definitely return soon and maybe be a little more assertive.

The caricatures on the wall of local \"celebrities\" and real celebrities are a great conversation piece. It keeps the mood light in an otherwise serious genre of restaurants. Let's get to the food.   I have tried a number of things here. Their portions are large enough for a hungry male or 2 hungry females. Their steak options are always delicious-simply prepared, and really let the flavor of the meat shine. These steaks are not dolled up and pampered. The girl next door of meats.   The bread basket is phenomenal. Love the seedy bread. I have split the crab cake entree with another female. These crab cakes are excellent. Not heavily breaded and served with a tasty mango salsa. Much like the meat, you are tasting the crab-as opposed to layers of butter/salt/misc. seasonings. For dessert, get the tiramisu. The lady fingers are soaked through, just the way I like them.   They have a nice wine selection-love the Stag's Leap Cabernet. Service is great to boot!",

Bread was good and service good, I had fish which was OK and the wife had steak which was good but the a filet had too much grizzle for her. The second visit was a works lunch, I had planned Del Frisco's for an American steak house experience for overseas guests but it was closed so decided to try the Palm. Big mistake, lunch menu was poor and the dinner menu is very over priced, the place was empty (not suprised) and my NY strip and fries was the worst steak I've ever paid for. Overcooked, tough and tasted like it had gone bad. I won't return to places that serve bad food knowingly.  The works lunch for three with soft drinks came to over $200 with tip, I don't mind paying for good food but thats a rip off for what we were served.  Pro's; The place has a traditional steakhouse feel and good waiters, the bread is excellent and location nice, not to busy, easy to park and nice for a stroll after diner.  Con's; The food is so over priced, the quality wasn't good and the whole experience very poor.",

I had also been warned about the food. It's a shame but both of the things I had heard were correct. The atmosphere and servers are great. Our waiter knew his stuff and worked with us to find the perfect meals for each couple. He was friendly, energetic, and a great salesman. We decided on the filet and lobster surf and turf. Then the food came... It just wasn't that good. Of all of our high dollar dinner nights this was the most expensive and the food was the worst. The steaks had no flavor and the lobster was overcooked. I had to ask for steak sauce to finish my steak. I look forward to a great steak when I am going to spend over $100 a person. The service is the only reason I am even giving them 2 stars so if you want to spend a ton of money on a bad meal with a talented wait staff this is your place. If you are someone who needs to spend a bunch of money for a steak go to Outback and leave your server a $100 tip. At least that way you'll enjoy your steak.",

    "text": "So I figured I needed one more 5-star steakhouse review, so here it is. Yes, I'm a fan of steakhouses, as much for the ambiance and service as I am the food. I like to call my visits to steakhouses, \"scotch & steak\" as that is how I roll at these places. Not the cheapest way to go, but the style that I choose. What sets The Palm at the top is its attention to service, not only to me, but everyone around me as I listened in to their conversations with other servers. Definitely a spot for loyal regulars of which I will now become one of.   Got there last night around 6:30pm and sat down at the bar and ordered my scotch from Michele, who was a great bartender offering up just the right amount of conversation. The bar area is long and has plenty of seats as well as small 2-top tables behind it. When my colleague arrived we decided to grab a booth next to the bar area...this is the way to go for me as you get the bar/lounge steakhouse feel. Now for the steaks...probably the highest price in Charlotte, even a tad higher than Morton's. All steak started in the $40's and went up to the $60's. My colleague, who is a regular, went with the \"off-the-menu\" porterhouse, while I went with the new your strip. Had my standard side of mushrooms and a wedge salad to start.   The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, with a \"Pittsburgh crust\", which adds the char to the steak. This is slightly different than a True Pittsburgh style steak, which had the char, but it cool/rare in the center. It was recommended my the waiter (thanks Tony!), and it was delicious! If you're around Southpark I would choose The Palm over Del Frisco's all day long.",

Two steaks, two prime ribs, two sides, a dozen oysters, three cocktails, and one bottle of wine equal a $454 check (not including tip). But the food was excellent. My mom's prime rib was about as big as her face, and the best she's ever had. The wait staff were all friendly and professional.   This was actually my second trip to The Palm. The first was two years ago (also for my dad's birthday; my dad really loves The Palm). On that occasion, the food was excellent, but the waiter was not very good. We actually had to ask for steak knives. When a neighbor later asked my mom how dinner went, my mom explained about the poor service. The neighbor told her daughter (who at the time was a server at the restaurant), who told her manager. A couple days later my mom received a phone call from the manager apologizing for the service, and was sent a $150 gift certificate. That kind of consideration for the customer (as well as the food) is what keeps my parents coming back the The Palm and me as well, as long as I'm not picking up the check. ;)",

    "text": "Five star and all star! Ok, so if you're looking for a great steakhouse without the prententious atmosphere I think you'll find it here.  It's my favorite premium steakhouse based on the fact they treat you like family every single time.  The wine selections are great and plenty.  I normally stick with the house Merlot or Pinot Noir.  Of course I normally always get a steak so always reds for me ;)  As you might know everything is a'la carte and served family style.  They have a great selection of salads and the blue cheese wedge is an all time classic there.  The sides for the entrees are also fantastic.  I normally stick with the asparagus friti or the three cheese mashed potatoes.  I've had both the lobster and a few of the steak selections when visiting.  My favorite steak there is the filet mignon oscar, medium, slightly pink in the center.  Always served to protection and a perfect temp.    Deserts are no slouch either here.  Most are pretty large and of course one of my favorites is probably one of the largest they have.  The 7-layer chocolate cake....chocolate overload!  No doubt, this is a fantastic place for a quick bar bite after work all the way to special dinners for anniversaries or just because type dinners.  NOTE:  The Palm also has a 'rewards program' of sorts.  You join for I think $50 for the years and you get a point for every dollar spent.  Once you reach 500 points you automatically get a free 3lb lobster for your birthday....ummm.....yes!",

This was probably one of the best Palm bar areas I have been to, with its vaulted wooden ceilings and extra-long mahogany bar. The two story high ceilings made the space soar, but the cozy dark booths lined up one after the other made it intimate too. And honestly, when do you go to a Palm and not feel like family?   The food was the same as in all over locations, delish. I'm always a bit surprised that I like it so much, and I shy away from chain restaurants, their food is always so sub-par, but the Palm constantly delivers a meal that makes my heart all aflutter.   I had a chicken Cesar salad, the lamb chops and we all split sides. I do have to give this location a shout out because their mashed potatoes were SO GOOD. I mean perfectly prepared. I was excited about this because it's the only complaint that I have with Palm One in NYC - terrible mashed. Ah well, it's a small price to pay for a meal to remember.   If you live in Charlotte, this may be one of your only options for decent food. This or Mac's Speed Shop...which isn't saying much.",

For the entree had the steak medallions with the fries/onion strings (the side choices are awful!!) and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak.  Desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. I got the chocolate because I love it and even that was rather disappointing but it was the best thing I ate. Truly I felt like I was eating somewhere like Applebee's and their prices do not reflect that. Thankfully it wasn't my tab and I'd never go back.
