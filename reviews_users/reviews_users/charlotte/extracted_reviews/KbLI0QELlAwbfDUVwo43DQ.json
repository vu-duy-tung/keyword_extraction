    "text": "This is a very hard review for me, but hopefully ... My explanation will help you understand the low rating. I ordered the blackened salmon with two sides of the smashed potatoes and the cucumber salad. Everything was very tasty. But the piece of salmon that I received was seriously 1 inch wide by 6 inches long. For $10! Now I'm not sure why, but every time I go, it seems like the salmon serving gets smaller and smaller. Not sure if it's because it's lunch? But I'm a big girl and I like a normal piece of fish. 3-4 inches wide by 6 inches long. Very odd experience for me. I wish I had taken a photo, but it was just so surprised that I just dug in and ate what was there.",

    "text": "I've been to Cajun Yard Dog a few times before however this is the first time I actually remembered to take a picture and leave a review haha. So this time around I got blackened meatloaf with tomato gravy and two sides, sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. The meatloaf was amazing and the tomato gravy made it 100 times better, the sweet potato fries are the bomb and the Mac and cheese was pretty good, the flavors are all there it was just a little salty for me. I don't remember what I had last time but I live near ballantyne so this place is a good drive, but it is definitely worth it. Mostly for the prices they have it's probably the best for cajun food. However if you're looking for a little upscale, it's a bit pricy compared to Cajun Yard Dog but, you should try Cajun Queen.",

I had the excellent chicken jambalaya, and my kids had the crab cakes and Cajun chicken.  Both were fantastic , especially the crab cakes - and we are from Maryland so praising NC crab cakes is saying something!  Can't wait to come back, but I highly recommend for anyone in the area!!  Great for a pre- or post -movie night bite to eat!",

Essentially a great fried chicken breast with a slice of ham on top followed by cheese and maque choux. Chicken, slice of ham, corn, cheese and spices. Although good, not exceptional. The mac n cheese was good. The potato salad was average. The jambalaya was good, but not exceptional for a Cajun restaurant. Maybe I was expecting more?

They were less than a foot away, and the host and owner manager kept walking up to our table, and talking to the people behind us. Terrible experience, although if we were at any other table, we would have had a great time. That one table sabotaged the entire experience for us and I can't see going back.",

We have tried almost everything and it is always great.  Last year, I had all my buddies from the office there to rave reviews.

Their specialty yard dog sauce was sweet and spicy- definitely one of a kind. Collard greens didn't have much flavor but I was okay with that as everything else I got was so flavorful . My boyfriend got steak with bbq shrimp and the shrimp was good (I don't eat red meat) as well as the steak per his words. He was in love with the sweet potato fries and homemade honey mustard , I swear he inhaled them. I will say for the price it isn't a lot of portion. No left overs as everything seemed to come measured in 1 cup servings. Other than the price vs. quantity of food everything was great!!!!",

Recently, it seems like they've changed the recipe for it. They used to be full sized oysters that was coated nicely in batter. Now, it's bite sized pieces and when I ordered my take out, it was overcooked. If I had the time, I would've requested them to remake it but today, I had to eat what was given.   They have other food items which aren't that bad. It's the only nearby creole that I know of. The decor has that Mardi Gras feeling. Very causal but it's a small seating area. If you plan on a large group, it's best to call in before stepping in.   Sometimes it's busy but at times when it's not, you would expect the servers to check on you every so to make sure you're good on the beverages.   It's a nice little restaurant and if you're in the mood for the type of food and are nearby, then definitely stop by.",

The food was great - we had the jalapeno devil eggs as an appetizer (perfection), both of us has the crab cakes (delicious - seasoned to perfection...I wish it was bigger tho), and I had a side salad and sweet potato fries. My friend had mac & cheese & cucumber salad. The mac & cheese was so good, we ordered an additional side of it & shared it.

We split the fried calamari as an appetizer, which was absolutely delicious - I loved the creamy cocktail sauce, and it also had some fried okra and even a couple of pieces of fried artichokes in the mix.   For our entrees, I ordered the fried oysters with a crab cake, and a side of mac and cheese and grits. All outstanding! The crab cake was especially good with a spicy sauce on top and a crispy outside.   My husband ordered fried shrimp, blackened Mahi Mahi and a crab cake with a side of sweet fries and Mac and cheese. The Mahi Mahi was delicious and I highly recommend that combined with the crab cakes for the perfect combo.   Service was really good as well. We will definitely be going back! We would have taken pictures of the food but we ate it all too fast!",

I had heard good things about this place but ultimately ended up leaving disappointed.  He ordered the crab cakes and I had the grilled chicken.  The chicken did have good flavor but it really needed to be charbroiled - I'm not sure how it was prepared but I just left wondering if they had boiled the chicken and then coated it with the seasoning.  I only ate half of my plate because it was very unappealing.  My husband's crabcakes were good - crispy on the outside.  The remoulade was also tasty.  Overall, I thought it was overpriced and underwhelming.  Likely will not be returning.",

    "text": "I visited a few weeks ago possibly last month because my friend had been craving fried green tomatoes! When we got there we were greeted right away, the waitress was able to give some good tips. We placed out app orders... fried green tomatoes... they were nasty, the breading that was on them was more like a panko breading, the tomatoes themselves were yellow (possibly due the season... maybe). We when ordered food, I ordered the platter that came with fried shrimp and fried catfish strips. I was so excited because I had been craving fried fish (I still am actually) when my plate came out the presentation was horrible! The shrimp did not look like it was cooked all the way, the fish looked to be fine. Against my better judgment I still tried the food! The shrimp was awful the color looked like it was more so tempura fried with no seasonings, the catfish had no seasoning at all. I thought gay since it was a Cajun restaurant there would be something but I was wrong... I sent it back after I took one bit of everything! When we told the waitress she went and got the manager, when the manager came to the table she seemed to be in the defensive side already because her arms were folded and very unwelcoming. My friend explained to her that we did not like our food and that we had sent it back pretty much right after we got it. She then went to say that sending the food back was a waste of food while my friend was explaining that it was a waste of money. The bill was taken care of but it was just a horrible experience. There were other other in the restaurant at the time that seemed to be fine with the food or possibly didn't know any better. This was our experience and we decided not to return again.",

Despite a small portion, the fish was seasoned perfectly, moist and full of flavor. The entree included fried green tomatoes which were crisp and tasty. My other side, the collard greens were.......Amazing! Service was very good, as usual. On previous visits, Etouffee has been inconsistent based on how busy the CYD is on that particular night. When the house is full my four stars can slip to just two. Sides never disappoint with the Jalapeno Deviled Eggs and Smothered Cabbage joining the greens as a must try! Last night, before 6:00, was a five star experience!  1/14/17 Tried the fried chicken and it was some of the best I ever eaten! Crispy and well breaded while remaking very juicy. These guys know what their doing when it come to their chicken! And the side......see the comments above.",

I can't tell if the people who own the place used to live in New Orleans, but they do act as if they do. I really hate to say that I believe that the place is authentic, as that its decorated with a few beads, and a \"burbon street sign.\" However, the beer lights are authentic [had the new orleans feathers], and the LSU flags were dead on.  Given that it was authentic, the food and service is not fast. I'm not sure if its because the kitchen is slow or if they are meticulous.   The food is simple. The place was packed [at lunch on a Monday]. The food had a small kick to it. The prices do seem a little high, but the portions are large. If you get a poboy, there will be a lot on your plate, enough for more than one meal. Additionally, given a no/low carb diet, you can ask for the rice&beans to be without the rice. Awesome! This place is comparable to my diet, close to where I work and live, and is close to average for a decent plate of food. I'm sold!  I had the catfish, and I liked it. I dinned with family members [who had never had Cajun food before] and they liked it as well.  Lastly: The TVs. Typically I abhor a television at a restaurant, but the sound was muted   and it didn't really take away from the atmosphere. People were happy to be here, liked the food, and were happy to be around each other.",

No matter how many times I wash my hands, my fingers are not clean enough to type of the holy deliciousness that is Cajun Yard Dog smothered cabbage. It's something like cheese sauce that the cabbage is in...I'm not sure what that stuff is, really, but it's GOOD.  There's all kinds of wonderful cajun specialties, and the menu also has a few Southern classics, like the pimento cheese plate. I enjoy the pickled vegetable salad as well.

I never leave disappointed...or without eating way too much.  A few of my favorite dishes: the pimiento cheese and pickled beets appetizer is incredible.  I'd never be one to order pickled beets but they're awesome and the pimiento cheese is perfect.  There are great sandwich selections (shrimp po' boys, catfish, fried chicken ....) but my favorites are the platters.  You'll get a huge helping of your choice of fried oysters, shrimp, chicken, blackened mahi...the list of mouthwatering choices goes on and on...and then you also get a choice of two yummy southern-style sides.  Mac n' cheese, collards, smothered cabbage, sweet potato fries....seriously it will take you a hot minute to decide between all the menu choices.  Lucky for us, there's a pick two platter option if you can't choose between fried oysters and blackened mahi--yes please!  I'm always part of the clean plate club here, so I've only been able to try dessert twice (pretty sure I was pregnant both times!) but no surprise it was amazing.  Loved the bread pudding with bourbon sauce and their pecan pie.  The atmosphere is fun--a small restaurant with tons of New Orleans gear hanging everywhere--beads, alligators, beer signs, etc.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  I've never had to wait more than a few minutes before someone comes over to take drink orders.  There's a good beer selection and a fun bar with sports channels.  Nothing goes better with some friend oysters than a nice cold beer and some SEC football!  There is limited seating, so it can be tough during the busiest dinner hours.  But remember, good things come to those who wait!",

I agree with another reviewer about the green beans -- they're ok but they put some ingredient in there that isn't quite right -- maybe sugar???  The etoufee is also very good.  Lesser favorites are the blackened meatloaf and the chicken cordon bleu.  Great comfort food and great, friendly service.",

    "text": "I consider myself a connoisseur of fried food.  And while that may not strike some people as anything to brag about, Cajun Yard Dog acts as proof that there is a right and a wrong way to fry.  And by God, they do it right.  I could go on for pages about this place, as it's certainly my personal favorite in Charlotte.  But I'll simply mention the sides, service and the beer.  Most entrees are accompanied by 2 sides.  Those sides range from collared greens to sweet potato fries, from gumbo (extra $) to some of the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.    The service isn't always fast.  But even someone as picky as I am about service will be pleased by the friendly, knowledgeable waiters.   The beer selection is pretty phenomenal for a place of this breed.  Lagers, Ambers, Fruit beers (including Purple Haze from Louisiana's Abita) Porters, Stouts,etc.  Basically, even micro brew drinkers can consistently find a beer that they've never tried.    If you enjoy spicy food, fried food, good food or good beer, do yourself a favor and try Cajun Yard Dog: Charlotte's creole connection.",

It was busy although we didn't have to wait. I ordered the chicken & andouille sausage  jambalaya w/ mac & cheese and my daughter got the crab cake po boy w/ sweet potato fries. My daughter's meal looked great and she said it tasted good too. The sweet potato fries were alright. My meal was a different story. The jambalaya was bland and must have been put on the plate too early because it was luke warm when it arrived. The portions were small and overpriced (14 bucks for the jambalaya). The mac & cheese was the saving grace. It was damn good. I will go back again but will have to try some other dishes. The service was very friendly.",

We waited about 20 minutes on Friday night around 5:50 for a table at this adorable restaurant that makes you feel like you are part of the family. Sat at the bar with friendly bartender, Graham seated us and consistently checked on us throughout the meal.  Lynn was our server, this woman works hard but still has time to talk to the regulars and make first timers feel welcome.  Then there is the food, the food is really good.  We started with the fried mushrooms and BBQ shrimp and grits.  The biggest, most delicate mushrooms we have ever had, accompanied with a homemade horseradish sauce.  The shrimp and grits were also amazing, we had to take over half of it home, because the portion was big.  We ordered the Crawfish Etouffee, the sauce was fantastic, the rice perfect (I prefer Crawfish when in season March - June) I think shrimp would have been a better choice, however my companion loved it.   The Chicken Cordon Bleu, was great.  Light crispy fried chicken, with Swiss, ham, and a sauce that was out of this world good.  I believe the owner/manager stopped to talk to everyone in the place, including us and was extremely friendly and bragged about the generous portions.  We will be enjoying our leftovers for lunch today and then hitting the gym to work it all off.  This is a great, casual, family dining place.  No frills, no pretension, just a Big Easy kind of place to grab great meal with great people.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that my only reason for giving Cajun Yard Dog 4 out of 5 stars is that they do not offer beignets.  And honestly I have only found one Cajun restaurant, not located in Louisiana, that offered beignets.  I feel like they are a staple of Cajun cuisine.  Ok, rant aside, the restaurant is small, and they do not have a hostess that greets you and takes your name if there is a wait.  When you arrive and walk in there is a yellow pad of paper sitting on an entry table that you add your name to and the number in your party.  It's best to arrive early if you do not want to wait to be seated.  We did not know this when we arrived and there were about six parties ahead of us, however, we chose to wait as our mouths were watering for some Cajun/creole.  And we were so glad we did!  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I ordered the chicken and andouille jambalaya, my husband had the red beans and rice and my father ordered the blackened mahi.  By the time we sat down and ate it was late and the waitress returned to the table to explain that they were out of mahi but could substitute tilapia.  He was not at all disappointed by the substitution.  In addition to our entrees we were each given the option of two sides.  I had the fried okra and the green beans.  The okra was delicious and I assume they must have used the same batter that they use on their fried chicken that all the yelpers talk about.  Delicious.  And the green beans were spot on, cooked perfectly keeping their bright green color while still having a little crunch.  Mixed in with the green beans were slivered almonds, if you have a nut allergy be sure to mention it as it does not indicate that the dish contains nuts on the menu.  The restaurant is decorated with Louisiana flare making you feel like you are in a cafe on Bourbon Street.  The noise level is high, which is not unexpected given the size.  There is a bar with seating for approximately 9, if you don't care to wait for a table keep an eye open for space at the bar.  The restaurant also offers carry out!  Happy to have found a little slice of Louisiana in Charlotte.  We will surely return.",

    "text": "With my visit to the city my friend recommended this place. I've only had one previous experience with Creole/Lousiana style food and it was painfully (pun intended) so. I was hoping that this new experience would turn me towards the light of Creole/Cajun food. Meh, not so much.   We ordered a app, essentially fried okra, calamari and artitchoke and on the menu it said it was to be served with a remoulade. First, I do have to admit everything was fried nicely- even the calamari. Typically most resturants cannot fry calamari correctly to save their asses. Cajun Yard Dog (CYD) did this well. The amusing thing that happened when our waitress dropped off our app is the 3 of us instantly noticed that dipping sauce was no remoulade by anymeans. It looked more like ketchup and mayo mixxed together because it was not throughly combined before placed in the ramekin. I was already hesitant to taste it just because of the unappealing appearance of this sauce. After we all tasted it, we concluded it tasted like cocktail sauce with mayo mixxed in. I did not use the dipping sauce after that and simply ate the app on its own.   I ordered the crawfish etouffee. When I ordered it I was really walking into it blind. I knew I wanted to try something different and I've actually heard of a etouffee. But I figured crawfish, rice in a sauce, it really cannot be too bad. I got my etouffee with a side of collards. My friends got a meat gumbo and a blackened chicken po'boy.   First appearance of my plate I was taken aback. There was a very hearty helping of crawfish indeed. But the sauce was a very dark brown murky looking color with bright red crawfish atop and small scoop (albeit) white rice underneath it with a small saucer of collards placed next to it. Appearance is not everything in food, I've learned that. Jumping headfirst into tasting it because I was eager to see what this etouffee was supposed to taste like, I took a large bite. First taste impression? I thought it tasted like sort of a muddy river. It reminded me of watered down dirt. It did not taste like much else so I covered it in the hot sauce they had sitting on the table hoping I'd like it more. I did. About 20 so splashes of hot sauce it was more appealing to me. My collards were a disappointment. I love collards. A school friend from back home prided himself on cooking 'soul' food well, and he does. His collards I can still remember the flavor and texture. Just soft enough where the leaves would melt, but the stems need to be slightly chewed and a delicious bacon-veggie flavor. I got none of that from my CYD collards. I thought the collards could have been cooked a little bit longer and it needed more overall flavor.   I had a small taste of my friends gumbo, she did not say much. So I guess it was not much to talk about. The blackened chicken po' boy was a very hearty size. I did not ask about the taste, but he seemed fine with his sandwich.   Though CYD has not turned me off from Cajun/Creole cusine I am still saddened I cannot find or understand what this love of spicy, heavily season cajun/creole food when all the food I've tasted has not been spicy and or even that flavorful to me.",

This dish is similar to the one at Cajun Queen. Its not spicy but the flavor is still on point. The grits were creamy and there was just enough sauce for some bread if needed. Would have liked some more sauce but it's all good.   The Fried Green Tomatoes are a bit under seasoned. Throw a bit of salt in those bad boys and we're in business. My Homie likened this dish to eggplant Parmesan with some crunch.  The service was top notch. Our waitress was very attentive even checking on us when we were done with our dishes and she collected them. I think the manager or owner (?) came over to make sure everything was okay with our meals. Stellar service... Smiles, patience, attentiveness... These are a few of my favorite things when it comes to service.   I'll have to come back with the dude to try some of their other tasty dishes.",

    "text": "My husband and I finally tried this place after having it Bookmarked for years.  I will have to say we were SURPRISED and far from disappointed. I am giving this place a 4 star rating because I personally couldn't eat much as it was still my first trimester of my pregnancy and my tastebuds were off but my husband and I have similar taste so I know that my pregnancy was causing some of my taste to be off plus I was still at the point of not holding food down and just experimenting to see what I can get with.  We ordered several apps and our server suggested the house made yard sauce which I mixed with the sauce that came with the fried oysters per her suggestion and man did it fix my tastebuds with all the food I ate (yum yummy sauce). After eating apps my husband noticed a chicken fried over at another table that the man seemed to have inhaled so he asked our server about it and was told that it's their number one seller. My husband immediately ordered it and the server let him know that it would take 20-25 minutes or more as it's cooked fresh and he was okay with that. The chicken arrived looking so wonderfully crisp and he and my son dived in and ate it down to the bone. My husband says it was the best fried chicken he has had since we moved to NC and he has been talking about returning for a long time now so we may have to make the trip over really soon. My only hang up about this place is the lack of compassion for those who don't eat pork. I mean I have Louisiana roots and even in Louisiana there are options to not have pork adolli or pork included in gumbo, etoufee, etc.. Those options are limited here as my family are none pork eaters and recently I have become vegetarian20%/Vegan 80% so I'm not sure I'll be able to eat anything here the next visit I'll be there to take pictures of my husband food and take his opinions to heart.",

    "text": "I am still a fan of the Cajun Yard Dog, but on my most recent visit, I did notice a couple of things that have gone downhill...which is why I dropped to 3 stars instead of 4 stars as in my previous review.    For starters, the place really needs to expand a bit...either with more regular table seating or a bigger bar that will accommodate more people. The wait times are just getting really long based on my last couple of visits.   Most recently, we arrived between 6-6:15 on a Friday, and had a 45-55 minute wait for a table.  This wouldn't be too terribly bad if there was sufficient room at the bar, or in the \"waiting area\" but neither is the case.   My S.O. had suggested we leave and go somewhere else, but I was really craving some Cajun food.  So he was a good sport, and agreed to wait.   When we were finally seated, we pretty much knew what we were going to order.  To start, we had an order of calamari.  I would not order this again. Our order was made up of less than 1/2 calamari and the rest was just the breaded fried okra and breaded fried onion. A little of that would be ok, but I would have liked to see more calamari.  On the plus side, I don't normally love remoulade,  but the stuff they served along with the calamari & okra was very tasty.   So, for my entree, I got the usual - shrimp etoufee with fried okra on the side. Usually this is my favorite combination... but honestly, they were just a bit off tonight. 1) If I had known how much fried okra they included in the appetizer, I would have ordered a different side item. 2) the Fried Okra was not as delicious as usual... it was a bit flat - it tasted sort of like the frozen stuff I buy at the grocery store. And 3) my biggest disappointment was my entree.  Usually, the etoufee is super flavorful, and very generous portion size. This time, my plate was full of rice, but the etoufee itself was a bit on the sparse side and not as flavorful as normal. I hope this is an anomaly, and that next time the quality & quantity is back up to par.   Our service was a-ok, considering how swamped they were. Oh, and kudos for the beer menu  - they always have a nice selection of different beers on the board.",

The Shrimp and Grits were rich and flavorful, with a hint of beer, jalapeno and Cajun spices. They were complemented by wonderful collard greens and smashed potatoes. No problems, but the portions could have been bigger. Since I live right across the street and expectations were pleasantly exceeded, I'll make it a point to come back.",

    "text": "We were looking for a restaurant close to my friends house and found Cajun. I asked the waiter about the most popular Po-boy and he suggested the shrimp. So I ordered the shrimp Po-boy with the smash potatoes and a side of the pickled beets. My friend had the fried shrimp, collards and fried okras. The Po-boy was larger than I expected and was delicious with just the right amount of shrimp, tomatoes and lettuce. The pickled beets was one of the best I have had from a restaurant, and plenty of them. My friend had the shrimp and they were large jumbo shrimp that wasn't heavily dipped in batter. The were light and flakey. She said the collards were good. I didn't taste them because they were  cooked in pork. A good night and a good choice of restaurants.  The only bad thing was waiting for a table and waiting for our food. I'm glad we didn't order an appetizer because we took home another serving of food.",

The small place is in a strip mall, decorated very cute with a Mardi Gras theme, the wait wasn't too bad, but we came early, 6:15pm. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She has been there for 14 years! We had the chicken seafood jambalaya with fried okra, fried chicken, smothered cabbage, fried shrimp, and mac n cheese. There wasn't anything that wasn't awesome!! The dog sauce was flavorful and not too spicy. It was great on the fried chicken, but the chicken was so good by itself. Even the blueberry and blackberry cobbler with ice cream was delicious. The chocolate Pecan pie was not as moist as we thought it could be, but it was still delicious. We also bought a tshirt as a souvenir.",

    "text": "I had a seafood craving and did my Yelp research on this place.  It was seat yourself and it took a bit to get anyone to the table even though the dining area was almost empty, so of course I'm sititing there freaking out wondering if this was a good idea while checking out the distressed walls, some TVs, and a non-overpowering Mardi Gras theme.  Not sure what was my apprehension because I was overwhelmingly pleased with Everything! I had to try one of everything, but settled on the shrimp platter, meatloaf po boy, etouffee, and seafood jambalaya.  Like I said, everything was good, but let's focus on the that meatloaf. My sons have never had a real po boy, which in my experience has always been a battered fried seafood.  I asked our server her recommendation and she \"promised\" the meatloaf version would be worth it.  Oh, if I could eat one of these every day!!!  I'm also a beer girl and had a little bit of trouble navigating the list, as it was just the labels and not the style of beer, but again my knowedgable server was able to assist.  I had a refreshing german pilsner while waiting for the food to arrive but switched to a New Orleans Dixie lager with the remainder of our meal.  I liked it so much I went to the store and bought a sixer!   The staff was so nice! The food - I guarantee (I hope you read that in your best Justin Wilson voice)  And Get There EARLY because by the time we finished this place was packed and a line was going out the door!",

When the food was finally brought to us, we still had to wait for a side that was being \"made to order.\"  Really, it takes over an hour to boil some noodles and make a watery cheese sauce for mac and cheese in a small side dish bowl?  The unsweetened tea had gone bad and I had to send it back.  My friend was brought the wrong beverage and then argued with when she said it wasn't what she ordered.  The owner was nice and apologized about our wait when we told him our problems, but we were only offered a free dessert after being told about their small kitchen and a large to-go order that had come in slowing down the restaurant.  At that point, we just wanted to leave.    This was my first experience at this restaurant.  I had heard good things, but good things wasn't my experience.

Since then, we've been back at least 4 times.  I could go every week..but my son wants to \"eat healthy.\"  Yeah...good for you.  The staff is always friendly..personable....with the charm that I didn't find that often at L.A. Restaurants.     The first meal I had was the fried catfish with jalapeno tartar sauce and greens and potato salad.  Loved the catfish..the greens were pretty good and the salad was okay...a little too much mayo though.  Since then I've had the blackened mahi...it was just okay.  I think it could have used a bit more seasoning.  Every time I've gone, I've seen people eating the fried chicken.  Finally yesterday, I tried it.  I'm a dark meat person.  It was great! I had a leg and a thigh.  The seasoning was just right...the crunch was...crunchy.  I had to tell the waitress how much I enjoyed .  She said they have a to go box.  You can call in advance..it'll take 1/2 hour or so.  Great to know...because I'm always at the Arboretum  I know what I'm doing this Mardi Gras.  They have big Mardi Gras celebration (duh!)..crawfish boil...possible alligator meat.  The waitress said its a busy, fu time. I can't wait.   One last thing...on our first visit..one of the daily dessert specials was a cobbler...I forget which one.  My son ordered.  It was HUGE!  Big enough for 3-4 people.  I don't like cobbler so it was left to him to try to eat after his meal.  I wish the waiter had told us that it was for sharing.  Needless to say, my son couldn't finish and he's a big 21 year old.  It came with ice cream..so couldn't take home.    After all is said and done, Cajun Yard Dog is our fav neighborhood place to eat..and will be my go to place for out of town visitors.",

The Jambalaya was great and tasted really fresh and homemade. I'd definitely go back for this. The smothered cabbage was different, but ok. It was like cabbage with a cheese sauce over it. The prices are a tad expensive, but they do give you quite a bit of food. The server was talkative and friendly.

    "text": "Cajun Yard Dog is my new favorite restaurant - I LOVE this place. Their crab cakes are delicious. My husband ordered the shrimp etoufee and said it was the best he's ever had. He loved the okra too. I ordered the fried shrimp and slaw. CYD's slaw is out of this world! My sister raved about the fried chicken, with Mac and cheese and smashed potatoes. She was even in New Orleans last month and said CYD beat all the restaurants in NOLA. The staff is super friendly too. Our server was so nice, sweet, and attentive. Lunch prices were reasonable too. My only complaint is that Cajun Yard Dog is not closer to us. Wish I had taken photos but we couldn't help but dig in to that Cajun deliciousness!",

This place is very casual and is typically stuffed at lunch, mostly with loyal regulars. Although not a regular, I do enjoy lunch here every couple of months or so.  I normally choose the mahi, with the mashed potatoes and the collards. Everything is served with their homemade biscuits. The Shrimp Po Boys are also tasty. Service is always reliable and the restaurant consistently reflects pride of ownership.",

The catfish fingers and Mac n cheese are seem to be consistently good. We were sold on bananas foster, it did not disappoint.. We will return!",

I ordered a piece of their black/blueberry cobbler to go since I was stuffed from my dinner. Our server packaged it up nice and neat and even packaged up some vanilla ice cream for me. I devoured it later that night and it was soooo good!! This place is really charming inside with its Mardi Gras decor and our server was very polite and friendly. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this restaurant and I will definitely return! Good, good food!",

The location is small, busy and loaded with aromas. My server Lynne was very friendly and enthusiastic! She talked me into a strawberry Abita (very good) and an appetizer. I have no clue how I agreed to try the deviled eggs, but that menu item was NOT \"eggs-cellent\"! Something's missing from the mixture. There was no flavor and they are just blah on a plate! At least they were cold...I had to chip the ice off!  I ordered the catch of the day, swai topped with a cream sauce of crawfish and shrimp. My two sides: mac-n-cheese and fried okra.  The fish was cooked perfectly! Very tender and flavorful. The cream sauce was delicious and the shellfish wasn't overcooked. The mac-n-cheese was spiraled pasta, made with a bechemel and cheddar cheese. I could taste the butter in the pasta which makes the flavor pop! The okra was fried crispy just how I like it. I even rolled a few pieces in the cream sauce.  Price wise, you're looking to spend $30 (app, drink & entree).  There's no liquor, just beer and wine. The location is small, so to avoid a wait, go at an off peak time.",

If you travel to New Orleans (or Rome, or Paris, or Hong Kong) you will find \"authentic\" food prepared hundreds of different ways.    So, who cares?  Does the food taste good? That's what I care about and the food at the Cajun Yard Dog tastes good!  The restaurant is small and feels like the kind of place where after you visit a few times the wait staff gets to know you and you become a friend.  I love that.  The food (appetizer and entrees) arrived quickly, were correct and were delicious.  The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled.  She smiled pleasantly at our kids dropping noodles and fries on the floor.  She was a winner:)  All the items we ordered were great.  I am pretty sensitive to spicy food and my Shrimp and Grits were not spicy at all.  I realize that most expect food at Cajun establishments to be spicy.  If you like yours spicy, I am sure they will adjust the heat.  The mac n' cheese was so awesome.  I cannot imagine the calorie content, but it was stellar.  Personally, I can't wait to go back.",

I work nearby and with all of the restaurants in the area this one stays on the list. Get there early (e.g., 11:30) and you'll get a good seat. Wait much longer during the week and it will fill up.

I gave it 4 stars because a friend of mine recently came with and tried the Ceasar salad, chicken gumbo side, and red beans n rice side.

After returning from the restroom we walked right over to Panera Bread.  Too bad as I was looking forward to trying this place for the Cajun food, but I probably saved my wife and I from an evening of stomach pains!  After a few episodes of food poisoning over the years I've learned that if a restaurant cares that little about the customer experience (that they refuse to even fix their restroom) how could anyone believe they care about your experience with their food/drink.",

At 1:00 on a weekday, the place was surprisingly busy and we were only able to find two seats at the bar, where there was a large TV tuned into a sports channel. The bartender took our drink order (a sweet tea for me and my friend went with a Red Oak draft) while we reviewed the menu.  I settled on the hamburger Po Boy, which was probably a mistake. Not that it wasn't good, but it was a burger on a baguette with mayo lettuce and tomato. I should have tried something a bit more Cajun, which was my own dang fault. I did get the sweet potato fries as my side and they were absolutely perfect - sweet and salty and plenty of 'em!  My friend asked the bartender for a recommendation and went with that - the meatloaf. He said it was very good with the two sides - mixed vegetables and mac & cheese.  The service was good and I was very pleased with the price too. Good, good food. I could see into the kitchen from the bar and it looked very clean. The only downside is that the place is very small  only  a handful of 2- and 4-top tables plus 4 or 5 seats at the bar.  Would I come here again? Absolutely!",

    "text": "Tucked away in the Arboretum Shopping Center is a little piece of Bourbon Street, dressed with mardi gras masks, Christmas lights, and beads.  Somehow they managed to keep it classy, with intimate seating arrangements and quiet music.  Think New Orleans jazz hangout rather than Girls Gone Wild.    I love their great beer selection with a big variety of IPAs, lagers, and stouts.  I have never once eaten craw fish in my life, and I decided to brave it out and order the Black and Blue Craw fish Pasta, the special of the night.  It was a portion large enough for two meals and it was scrumptious.  I thought the blue cheese complimented the crawfish (and I was a little scared of this combination at first).    Taylor, our waiter, spoke with us about the restaurant and his love of Cajun food.  I felt very welcomed and I am a craw fish fan now as well.",

I have opentable and I am used to walking in and sitting down, but the food is just so darn good here I give in every time. Hmm. What do I like. Umm. Everything.  But most of all the chicken, the catfish, the fried green tomatoes, the jambalaya. The owner is also omnipresent which shows just how much the place means to her. The desserts are really great too, but you knew that.  I would tell you what time of the day I noticed it was slower, but then it wouldn't be slow at that time anymore now would it? So fend for yourselves!  Just kidding. It seems to be slow around 2pm. When I say a wait I mean 1-2hrs 5-9pm every time I've gone so if you can go at an off time and you have ants in your pants like me do so.",

We ventured down to south Charlotte, and found ourselves there right before the dinner rush (and yes, there was quite the rush/wait after we got in). We started with the calamari that had artichokes and okra. There was a lot more okra than I wanted, but the calamari was light, crispy and delicious. Then I ordered the shrimp etoufee for dinner with a side of beets. The etoufee was just the right amount of subtle spice, but extremely flavorful and I wanted to lick my plate clean. The beets were delicious, some of the best I've had out in Charlotte, and I wanted more of them! My husband had the fried chicken, and he was raving about the crispy skin but moist chicken inside. He nicely shared a bite with me and I couldn't agree more, it was delicious!  Cajun yard dog is definitely a place we will frequent again and again!",

The Shrimp and Pimento cheese grits are beyond to die for and even had me learn how to make pimento cheese to mix into my grits and I will not have them another way now. Ambiance is what you would expect of a restaurant that prepares southern/creole cuisine but it's not horrible, it actually fits in nicely and was a fun place to eat at.

I usually go to Cajun Queen because of the convenience and they also offer I standing Groupon deal but this is definitely the better of the two.  I have been here multiple times and it never disappoints. It is very small and you generally have to wait if you come here on a weekend for dinner but it is so worth the wait.   Though their specialty is Cajun food it definitely has a soul food flair. I could honestly just come here and just eat sides. They have the best cabbage I've ever had in my life and their Fried Chicken is to die for.  Tonight I opted for the special because it looked way too good to pass up and it came with two sides. It was a blackened sea bass top with blackened shrimp and a sea crab sauce. Whatever you're thinking it tasted 10 times better.  If I had to find one fault it would be that they do not have a full bar however they do have beer and wine and they have some great local beer from New Orleans. Get the Dixie Voodoo. Trust me you won't be disappointed!",

Our waiter was the owner of the restaurant and he was super busy with greeting and sitting people, handling other tables, running food, and to go orders. He was very polite and super friendly. My boyfriend did have to get up and get his own straw after it was forgotten a few times. Other than that, our experience was awesome.

The side dishes are great, especially the mac & cheese and fried okra. The bread pudding is fantastic, just make sure they put enough bourbon sauce on it... I keep getting drawn in by the fried oysters. They are consistently fat and juicy, they have a very light cornmeal-based crust for a nice crunch, and whoever is working the fryer, is a genius. Those oysters just come out perfect every time. (Oh, definitely get the jalapeno tartar sauce.) It's not a huge place, which helps give a little bit of a cozy neighborhood hangout feel, if you live in a neighborhood where a Mardi Gras has recently exploded. It's a fun vibe. The service is good, the staff is friendly, and I've never had a bad meal there. Get thee to the Cajun Yard Dog!",

The man who answered put the manager on--it was actually the woman we ordered from. She said they've didn't give us more because we hadn't ordered green beans in the first place. What? Then why tell us to drive back for some?  She was rude, condescending and argumentative. She wouldn't let me finish a sentence and she was yelling at me. People in the room that heard us place the order could hear her yelling through the phone. We had ordered green beans--had to tell her twice when ordering. Regardless, it seems the customer is always wrong at the Cajun Yard Dog, and the staff gets away with rudeness. In any event, food not worth the hassle or the price--we spent $60 for an appetizer, a small salad and two entrees. Probably the lousiest meal and service ever for even half the price. We recommend Cajun Queen over this bar food (rubbery chicken and crawfish) and  obnoxious service any day!",

    "text": "Cajun in Charlotte... I've been to Cajun restaurants throughout Louisiana (New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, etc) and some in Atlanta so when I moved to Charlotte I had to find one here too. Walking in the door there's a small dining room (20 tables maybe); menu is what's expected: red beans and rice, seafood gumbo, po-boys.  So I ordered seafood gumbo to start (this is a meal of its own) and fried catfish w/ Mac&Ch and creamy grits (no carb diet for me) so let's get into this.  Seafood gumbo was just ok; roux was (too) thick with 2 large shrimp, chunks of chicken, andouille sausage, 5 mussels and handful of crawfish tails but I was missing my veggies (okra, celery, bell peppers, onions... anything).  Catfish meal was also just ok; nice crust on the fish, 4 strips is equivalent to 2 medium filets so portion was decent. Mac&Ch isn't worth writing about. And grits were creamy and that's my only comment.  Will I return... probably with my family when the visit and I'll try something else but I wouldn't go out of the way to run back here.",

I happen to love savory but some of the dishes here were a bit too salty for me, like the catfish. And the collard greens.  The fried chicken is well seasoned and tasty but very tangy so if you are not into vinegar marinades this fried chicken is not for you.  I like it.  The fried okra is delicious and salty... Maybe a little too salty but I think we all new what we were getting into going in.  I mostly do take out here because it's very close to home and the service isn't phenomenal.  The servers always seem overworked or like they have another pressing matter to attend to that just doesn't happen to be the diners.  What I love most about this place is for about 30-35 bucks I can get a quality bucket of 16 pieces of chicken and two sides and for a busy mom with a party of 5 and boys who play lots of week night sports, this saves me time and sanity which I'm sure some of you can appreciate.",

Five stars for the fried okra and chocolate pecan pie, 2 stars for the deviled eggs  and 1 star for the iceberg tomato salad. I wanted the Cesar salad, but they were out of romaine lettuce. The place is small and we waited at least 40 minutes for a table, but there's a lot of shops in the strip mall to pass the time. Our server was courteous and efficient.

I had the Cordon Bleu, which I love, so was hoping the reviews were correct.  I ordered a beer as well.  Not the best selection but manageable.  Anyway, as soon I saw the ham and cheese on top of the chicken, I was skeptical.  Yup, not the way to prepare this dish.  It was a little dry.  It wasn't horrible but I was expecting a lot more. The mashed potatoes were just okay as well.  The waiter never asked if I wanted another beer and my wife had to hunt another staff member down to get water.  I may try it again if friends wanted to go, otherwise, I don't think so.",

    "text": "My very first visit to Cajun Yard Dog occurred soon after I returned to Charlotte, NC after a year in Miami, FL in 2005/2006. The eclectic decor was charming, definitely a conversation starter, like a visual story that got my imagination running.  On my first visit (pre-dinner), there was NO WAIT!!!  I sat at the bar even though there were available tables back in the day - the staff swears there are \"No Wait\" times that happen throughout the day currently, but I've never seen it myself :)  I had a glass of wine & the etouffee; I was hooked!!  I've NEVER had a bad meal there, not one single time!  As a matter of fact, the food is ALWAYS INCREDIBLE!!  Cooked and prepared to perfection consistently and with fresh ingredients - this applies to everything I've personally tried on the menu (to include specials on the board); appetizers, fish, sides & DESSERTS!!!  Anything fish at Cajun Yard Dog is my favorite...fried, blackened or grilled.  To date I haven't had a bad fish experience there & honestly I think that speaks volumes!!  On our most recent (but definitely not last) visit there about a week ago, I had the catfish bites, my partner had the trout and our guest (out of town from Ohio) had the redfish - ALL THREE DISHES WERE SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  We split a HEALTHY sized portion of Peach Cobbler that was \"right out of the oven\" and it was mouth wateringly divine!!!  Mind you, I haven't tried EVERYTHING on the menu, but I've probably come close after patronizing this restaurant for 9 years.   For me and my partner, we choose to return to a restaurant because the food is amazing, but I must say the gang at Cajun Yard Dog is FANTASTIC, too and you'll want to come back to visit with them just as much as coming back for a delicious meal!!  Chances are you might find yourself soon conversing about kids going off to college with the wait staff after a few visits!!  I've read a few reviews here today about Cajun Yard Dog and frankly was a tad bit surprised about how some people make it personal; one claiming it was a redneck hangout, a few reviewers felt the need to point out the staffs hair (something along the lines of not being perfectly in place), fingers or they way the staff appears as if they want to be somewhere else.  I've worked in the food service industry - it's a demanding job and all I have to say about that is \"THANK YOU STAFF\" for working your butts off and making this NON-CHAIN, NONCONFORMING little slice of yummy paradise a gem!!!  I don't give a damn if your hair isn't perfect and though you didn't expect to have to work 4 or more doubles/split shifts in a row...you did anyway and not only did you do it, but you were AWESOME while doing it!!!  Hell, I KNOW I secretly daydream of being off in a place far, far away from reality at times - sometimes I even dared to daydream while I was at WORK (especially if I'm having a crap week).  I think it's pretty hilarious, too, that a restaurant would be judged / rated on whether or not they serve alcohol; I go to a restaurant to eat, not to have a \"Hurricane\" frou-frou drink.   Cajun Yard Dog is UNIQUE and is NOT your typical pretentious / \"Charlotte-Stepford Style\" / let's keep up with Jones' / where to be seen local \"hot spot for the minute\" kind of place - THANK GOODNESS!!!  Cajun Yard Dog has substance, heart & soul - the quality of the food and the staff sees to that.  Guess that's why they've been around a while!!  Already dreaming of our next visit :)",

    "text": "Finally made it in to Cajun Yard Dog! This place can be a bit tricky with getting a table! Quaint inside, popular for sports fans and great food can pack out the inside in no time flat. My wife and I ventured in for an early-ish dinner on a Saturday night.   The menu houses a phantasmagorical array of Cajun choices. Etouffe, jambalaya, seafood....all choices apropos for the bayou-seeking culinaries.   First, we ordered a few drinks and an app. Great beer choices. Red Oak from outside of Greeensboro, and Abita root beer. If you haven't had Abita's root beer, you must. It's incredibly flavorful and not overtly laden with sassafras. The house-made chips are wondrously prepared. A little more done than most, served with herb sour cream and a BBQ cream. The BBQ cream is faint and sweet and the herb is much more pungent.  My wife ordered a menagerie of side items. Veggies, Mac n' cheese, fried okra and jalapeno cheese grits...oh, those grits. They are incredibly creamy and packed with flavor(s). All were fantastic.   I had the chicken jambalaya. A HEAPING plate of jambalaya packed with chicken, smoked summer sausage, rice, spices and a brilliant sauce. Each bite is packed with that roux-y, tomatoe-y, spicy sauce and the chicken/sausage chunks in each bite are subtle and plentiful. The level of spice is manageable for anyone, in my opinion. Not over the top but definitely enough for you to recognize throughout the meal. There was so much of it, I had to take most of it home!    Prices are fair and the service was great. Next time, have to try the desserts!  So happy with this quaint, festooned with Mardi Gras accoutrement, Cajun joint! Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "For someone that likes Cajun style food but without the seafood part, it was a bit odd for me to come. However, I have passed by this place numerous times, I figured I'd give this place a try.   I came during lunch time. There wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant, but within 10-15 minutes, it got pretty busy.   I ordered the blackened meatloaf with the smashed potatoes and green beans with almonds. The meatloaf was topped with a tomato sauce with some tomato chunks, onions and topped with green onions. The meatloaf had a slight kick to it which was nice. The potatoes were good and green beans also tasted great.   The price of it was very reasonable for lunch. I didn't feel like the service was bad. My sever did stay pretty busy, but there was another lady walking around, filling drinks and cleaning up tables so that was nice.  Can't wait to try something else next time!",

It's the service that's killing it all.   The side salad are awful. They up-charge $3, even if you opt out of getting any other sides at all. It's basically a big huge plate of lettuce only. A pale tomato and 2 cucumber slices on the side. You get a tiny dressing and $.50 for any extra. Rip off. The lettuce was gross. Bitter and just too much.   We waited so long for our food. After it was delivered, the waiter never came back. It was pretty bad. We had to hunt him down to get boxes and a check. The busboy had to help us with refills and food that the waiter forgot to bring out. The busboy was nice.  I won't be coming back. I've learned my lesson with this place.",

The ambiance in here is so beautiful and reminiscent of New Orleans. If you've never been to N.O you'll definitely get a feel of it here. The staff is super chill and inviting, always checking your table to make sure your good. The food comes out fast, hot and good!!! I had the catfish platter that comes with two sides and everything was perfect. The collards are freshly made and my sweet potato fries hit the spot. I know that there are other locations but I'm gonna stick to what I know. They haven't steered me wrong yet",

And honestly, you can eat that sauce with about any other meat. I often eat it with the fried chicken. For lunch, I had smothered cabbage with my fish. So, so good!  It's like a ma & cheese sauce meets cabbage.  Today we got here around 2pm for lunch. During peak times there could be a wait of an hour or so. But it's worth it! The wife also likes their bread pudding. It's a very huge portion and comes with a very nice caramel sauce. I'd suggest getting a scoop of ice cream to go with it.",

I tried their Crawfish Etouffee this time, along with a side of Gumbo Soup...and both were so incredibly bland and blah!! I actually had to pour some salt into both dishes, and still, utterly tasteless! Did they have some substitute chef back there today, or what? I just can't understand how one dish can be soooo damn good (Jambalaya from my last visit), and yet, another dish be soooo damn bad?? Maybe it's just me...but for Etouffee, I prefer the sauce to be on the thinner side...more soupy. Here, at least for today, the sauce was super-thick and pasty...and even worse, there was barely any flavor to it. Add to that, it just tasted stale...NOT fresh at all. Possibly the worst Etouffee I've ever had in my life!  Gumbo Soup was the same - NO flavor. Even their Iced Tea - ZERO flavor. Did the chef just pour extra water into everything?!? Honestly, I was embarrassed. Why? I actually recommended this place to several folks. Even for this lunch gathering here with several friends today, I vouched for how good the food was! From the mild reactions to their dishes, I sensed that everyone was underwhelmed. One positive outcome from my visit here? I managed not to gain any weight...as I barely ate half the portion of my soup AND entree.  Yes, shockingly enough, I did NOT finish off my plates!!! Overall, it was a shocker for me....going from a 5-star to a 1-star dining experience. :\\",

I was by myself so I saw a table in the corner so I sat at that table, I asked the waiter if she could wipe it down it took her awhile but she finally did. I ordered the jambalaya and the deviled eggs as my appetizer, it took about 15 for the waiter to take my order, which I thought was pretty long. My jambalaya came out before my deviled eggs which made it pointless for me even getting it as an appetizer. The jambalaya and the Mac and cheese was pretty good and flavorful, the deviled eggs were just okay. As I was eating I noticed that I had no silverware nor napkins only a fork that she had brought out inside of a bowl. I didn't get a refill on my water until I was about to leave which was quite irritating..the food was good but the service sucked! I may give it another try though.",

I looked at my Yelp bookmarks and there was the Dog right around the corner.  Wound up sitting at the bar, was immediately greeted, given a menu and a glass of water to help cool off on a hot day.  I wound up ordering a combo of fried catfish and shrimp with a side of fries and a side salad which they brought out first.  Salad was fresh and crisp with decent blue cheese dressing and the catfish/shrimp came out hot but not overcooked and came with lemon and some tasty tartar sauce.  The woman serving at the bar was very friendly and when all was said and done I was in and out quickly and left full and happy.  Just what most folks are looking for out of a workday lunch.    If I lived closer to the Arboretum I would absolutely have Cajun Yard Dog on the regular rotation.  Seems like a fine place with good food, good service and a nice vibe.",

The place is small, so expect a wait if you go during peak times. The food was ok, but not spectacular.  Waitstaff was nice and friendly.  I had the fried flounder special over fried green tomatoes with a bleu cheese slaw.  The fish was ok, but under seasoned, and the fried batter just fell right off and was a bit soggy and not as crispy as I would expect.  The fried green tomatoes were the best thing on my plate, they were very good.  The slaw was alright, but not very strongly seasoned or flavorful.  We had some gumbo, which was ok, but again underseasoned, and had lots of rice and not much meat or veggies.  Someone else ordered the blackened trout, which was ok, but still, underseasoned.  Blackened should be very spicy, but it wasn't at all.  The mac and cheese was ok, but with that runny cheese sauce like out of a box, not stringy like there was actual melted cheese in it.  Collards were ok, nothing to brag about.  The best thing we had was the Jambalaya, which was still skimpy on meat and mostly just rice.  It was seasoned very well though and had a little bit of heat.  Overall it was an OK meal, but I've had a lot better.  When I end up dousing everything in hot sauce its clearly not a great meal.",

    "text": "After trying Cajun Yard Dog for the first time yesterday I am even more convinced that I don't love Cajun food. I think I have tried every Cajun food place in Charlotte and each time I leave dissatisfied. Yesterday was no different. I was certainly underwhelmed by the food.   The atmosphere was cozy and a little over the top tacky but in an entertaining way. My guest and I sat at a corner table. No one puts Baby in a corner! Sorry I just had a Dirty Dancing flashback.  I was fine sitting in the corner.   We were greeted immediately which was nice and the waitress was more than happy to give us the rundown of the menu and her personal favorites. She did not like the Etoufee. Oh that's not a good sign. My intention was to order the Etoufee. Now what?  I had the Fried Oysters and I will say this, they were probably the BEST Fried Oysters I ever had! The coating was DELISH! Light, crispy and non greasy. I could have pigged out on the oysters alone and would have left very happy. The only problem was there were only 6. I personally would have liked a few extra on the plate. The big disappointment came with the sides. Fried Okra (hello, one of my favorite veggies!) and Red Beans and Rice. Doesn't get anymore Cajun then that. The Okra was over fried and VERY GREASY. Yuck! The Red Beans and Rice was equally disappointing. It was very bland and they were luke warm.    For what we got I felt the price was high especially for lunch. 6 oysters, Red beans and rice, Fired Okra and a club soda, $15.80 before tip.  A little steep IMO. Throw a dozen oysters on the plate and then I will gladly pay the $$.",

    "text": "This place has excellent food. Definitely a gem in charlotte. HOWEVER. They must figure out a better way of making people wait. There has always been a wait each time I've gone, so I'm sure the restaurant knows they are popular and people will wait for their food. At the moment they have a sign in list at the front, on a normal legal pad, with no one monitoring it. People write in their own names and a restaurant employee comes over every once in a while to call out a name. There is limited waiting area inside and some space outside. During the winter months it is cold and most are forced to wait outside to hear their name. THey need to introduce something where they can text you when your table is ready, or have a heated area outside for people to wait. There is a nice wine bar in the same complex where we went while we waited  but we're worried we'd miss our name. We came back only to wait at least 30 minutes longer in the freezing cold because there is no heating outside. I love this restaurant, I really do, but please update your waiting area situation to make it more appealing to diners.",

Ok, the way some of these people described this place made me think I was gonna walk into some kind of shithole. This place is adorable!! Small and cozy. Very Mardi gras themed, but not over the top. We went around 6:15 on Saturday and were seated right away. Waitress really nice, knowledgable, and attentive. We ordered the jalapeno deviled eggs and they came with a ton of jalapenos which weren't needs, since the eggs had a nice kick already, but needed more mayo. Obviously premade, but good. We saw other plates coming out and they looked big so we split the half fried chicken and two sides. The wait was a little long, but it's cooked fresh and it was understandable. The chicken was hot and fresh and crispy and good.! Not the best fried chicken I've ever had but very good. Spices were really nice and not over-the-top but delicious. Tasted very homemade. The potato salad was really good had some horseradish in it. I've never had fried okra but they're on the same type of flavor profile as a zucchini and they were pretty good too. Overall,  the chicken was good and I would definitely go back but I definitely want to try another chicken place that might beat this one. I think it might be Price's Chicken Coop as far as I hear.",

    "text": "TL;DR version: Food is definitely lacking, but not inedible. Fried catfish appetizer was best. Sauces and Dressings were decent. Blackened fish was inexcusably dry and overcooked.  Banana Foster was good, although the ice cream was noticeably old even after being drenched in cognac sauce. Ambiance was lively and enjoyable. Server (Marc) was knowledgeable, timely, and friendly.  Host (possible owner?) was a total dick.  This was our first ever visit to the CYD.  It was around 7:45 on a Saturday night. We added our name to the legal pad by the door and I asked to see a menu as the host was leading a party to their table. \"Absolutely\" he said, as his eyes pointed towards the floor. No smile. A few minutes later he returned and crossed our name off the list, and asked if we were ready to sit.   \"Actually, We'd like to see a menu before we make a decision.\" I said. We immediately decided the menu would be acceptable (for the teens, that's why we asked).  Another group of four entered the restaurant. The host sat them ahead of us, then had the audacity to tell me they were there before us. It wasn't a huge deal, as the next  table had just become available, which he explained.  He led us to the still dirty table, and as he was wiping he told us that we could just let him know when the 4th member of our party arrived and he would bring a 4th chair.  I wasn't down with that plan. He wanted us to sit down, but then when our 4th member (who was still in the car) walked in, you want me to get up from my seat, chase you down to ask you for a 4th chair while she just stands there? Don't think so, buddy. So I grabbed an empty chair from the table beside us and pulled it up to our table. \"I have chairs over on that side.\" he tells me. Good. Good for you. Go get it yourself. WTAF?   Our server was prompt and polite. We enjoyed the beer selection...from the list that the host failed to provide us with. (Can you tell this dude rubbed me the wrong way? Letting it go now ;) We ordered the fried catfish app which was piping hot. There were five pieces. That fifth piece was highly coveted. I had a side salad, which was reasonably fresh. It was a spring mix with shredded carrots, tomato wedges, and sliced cucumbers. No complaints there.  Entrees: Blackened salmon w/horseradish sauce. Sauce and seasoning were satisfying. Salmon was dreadfully overcooked. Regular & Sweet potato fries were both acceptable. Mahi--same issue. Tooo dry. I had the special, which was blackened tuna over dirty rice with a crawfish basil sauce. Tuna was (can you guess? I bet you can guess.) waay overdone! The rice? Tasted like it came right out of a stainless steel 1/9 pan. Definitely not fresh. It wasn't even warm.  I liked the crawfish, though. You might be asking why we did not alert our server to our distaste, especially before writing a less than stellar internet review. That's a fair question, and as shitty as I have made it sound, we ate ALL of our food. 6 hours in the hot sun at a Rugby tournament, and you too would eat whatever was set before you in its entirety. The food wasn't THAT bad, but it was unequivocally unimpressive. Except the Banana Foster. That gets a solid thumbs up. Yum!  Another shout out to our server, Marc, who never let our drinks run dry, spaced our courses perfectly, and answered all of our questions. He cleared and reset the table between each course.  Great job, Marc!",

She made our daughter feel great buy teaching her how to make a star in the bead necklace, (Lynn---Shelby thanks you!)  After reading reviews here we decided to order the deviled eggs, although they were tasty- I think my own have bolder flavors. BUT the fried green tomatoes was outta this world!! WOOT WOOT we had the fried chicken which was recommended by Lynn and it was really good, I could taste that they are either soaked in Texas Pete or it is at least part of the breading process. but detected no \"heat\" per say. The chicken was crispy outside and very juicy inside. The mac n cheese is nice as well as the cucumber salad.  Great place to get some fried foods that are made to order and in house!!! no pre processed crap here!",

Strike one is that in our visit for our first time was with a large party, and we were initally informed it would possibly be anywhere from an hour or 2 to be seated. The hostess was not willing to truly work at first with us, and made us feel that we were inconviencing her. We nearly left, but we were given the option to be seated in another fashion and we gave it a try. Honestly, the service was poor. Our server didn't smile an inkling, and it felt as though we were somehow an imposition on her. Our food was delivered in a timely manner, but to be frank...the food was average. It tasted good, but it was very laden with oil and the balsamic vinaigrette for the salad is extremely sweet. And something I ate there left me ill by the end of the evening. To top it all off, the decor is extrmely tacky and you could see dust around the restaurant. My husband and I, personally, will not recommend this place to our friends...nor will we be returning.",

    "text": "Great restaurant for years. We have been hundreds of times. Lately we limited our ordering to fried chicken which remains great.  Other choices have been declining in quality to the point of being sometimes inedible.  We have sent fish back three times in a row.  Veggies watery and overcooked except the greens which have gone from sublime to tasting like cardboard.  You have to beg for the included biscuits and pay a dollar for honey.  Waits for tables are always long and even regulars are ignored when there are open tables at busy times.  Last night we planned as usual to arrive before the rush at 5:45 so we could dine in time to reach a movie.  Two tables for 4 were open when our friends arrived and they asked to be seated.  The hostess was rude and nasty saying they would have to wait until we all were there.  We were late by 5 minutes because of a call about our mother from the rest home she just moved to.  They complained and asked the manger to seat them explaining their predicament.  They got the last table for 4 and the gruff hostess knowing we were soon arriving promptly ripped the additional two chairs from the table even though there was no one waiting at that minute for these two chairs without a table.  Knowing this would not work,our friends left.  On the way out,the father of the hostess who has to our knowledge no association with the restaurant flipped off our friend and his wife and told him to, \"get a life di..head\".  At which point our friend appropriately dropped the f bomb toward this sicko.  When I arrived and was told of what happened by our friends wife, I asked to meet with the owner,Ron Atherton, who told us the hostess was simply following policy. He called our friends liars even though i didn't tell him what they said. I told him it was a stupid policy and that it was now our policy not to dine there again despite being regulars for years,essentially since the day it opened.  Will miss the chicken but not the rest of the crap.  There is always New South in the same center, always great with the nicest owners in the world and the fantastic Table274 in Cotswald to replace this tired old dive with a rude owner.",

Bar selection good too! Very affordable and healthy portions... Depending on how you look at it lol",

They have a pretty nice beer list that includes Abita, naturally.  I had the shrimp and grits with a side of fried okra.  I make shrimp and grits at home and I'm a pretty good cook, but this was much better than the one I make!  The grits were very creamy and cheesy, and the shrimp were flavorful!  The fried okra was fantastic; the coating was light and not greasy at all.  My sister always gets the chicken and waffles if they have them on special and she said it was fantastic!  My dad had the fried oysters and red beans and rice and his plate was clean at the end of the meal.   Service was fantastic, Jennifer did a great job of treating us like family and checking up on us as we enjoyed our meal.  If you love cajun/creole food or just want to try it, Cajun Yard Dog is your place!",

    "text": "I often venture into Arboretum for a range of miscellaneous reasons and one day, I noticed Cajun Yard Dog. What does Cajun Yard Dog even mean? Does it matter? No, not really, but it definitely caught my eye. To me the name said simple, very casual and authentic. I bookmarked it immediately vowed to come back and see how it upholds to my beloved, Cajun Queen.  My cousin was visiting from California and we were yelping through Charlotte trying to figure out where to eat for dinner. I mentioned that I've been meaning to try Cajun Yard Dog just because the name is just so random and cool. That was enough reason for him and let me tell you, BEST life decision ever. We ordered fried oysters, deviled eggs, gumbo, fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, fried fish and much much more. The madness does not stop for fat kids. How do you judge how amazing a place is on the amazingness scale? It is how guilty you feel after every bite yet you still finish every single thing you ordered!  I've been back maybe 10 times since that first visit and Cajun Yard Dog never fails me. If I HAD to recommend a few dishes to you, it would have to be the Crawfish Etoufee, Shrimp & Grits and the Blackened Whatever the Fish of the Day is. I've had the fish of the day three times and every single time, it was AMAZING. Squeeze the slightest bit of lemon on there and viola! PERFECTION. The Crawfish Etoufee is steaming of flavor in every bite and they are mighty generous with the amount of crawfish you get (and for $10!). If you don't get the shrimp & grits, you HAVE to get the cheese grits as a side along with the Green Bean Almondine. No idea what kind of wizardry goes on in the kitchen, but I am beyond addicted to Cajun Yard Dog! The food is amazing. The staff has that southern hospitality that makes you feel just at home and the prices are RIDICULOUS.. ridiculously CHEAP! See this is where I'm conflicted. As much as I love Cajun Queen, the prices are steep! Cajun Yard Dog gives me the authenticity, the quality and the bang for my buck. Let's just say I've cheated on my beloved CQ quite a bit nowadays.  Side note: I recommend going for lunch instead of dinner. The portion sizes between lunch and dinner aren't significantly different, but the prices definitely are! Lunch prices are about $10 or less and dinner prices are close to $20. I have to admit that even though I know this, I still came back for dinner once because I couldn't get the yard dog cravings out of my system and the next day was Sunday (the only day that they're closed)! Not my fault, I was trapped.",

Whenever we have visitors, CYD is always on the list of things to show them, and have yet to have anyone not love it!  The shrimp and grits, jambalaya and mac and cheese are amazing! The owner always makes the rounds checking on each table which is a nice personal touch.  The decor is fun Mardi Gras style.

We saw this place across the parking lot and decided to make a run for it. I'll try to keep it short.   The menu got me stupid excited. It was like I was three years old and stumbled into a candy shop, only full of Cajun food. Every dish sounded great. It was a list full of classics. We got there after three, so we missed the chicken and waffles! Dammit!   I decided on the Catfish po'boy so I could eat half and save room for the chocolate pecan pie later. My friend ordered the blackened meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  My po'boy was okay. I've had better, but it wasn't bad. My friend's meatloaf and sides were very good. Though, there was nothing blackened about that meatloaf. A bit of a misnomer, but awesome nonetheless.   Dessert fell flat. My chocolate pecan pie tasted more like a melted hot fudge sundae. I wish the chocolate had more body to it, like a custard. My friend's bread pudding was also just okay.   I plan on returning, but next time I'll try an entree instead of a po'boy. OH, no liquor here. They only serve beer, wine, and nonalcoholic drinks. It's too bad. I wanted a hurricane. The whole experience had a lot of potential. It was almost great.",

I was very pleased and excited to come back and try other dishes at this restaurant now knowing that nothing we ordered was bad.

My dad loved his fried catfish strips, my mom ordered some fried oysters that were also delicious. The chicken my sister ordered came out fried to perfection. My girlfriend cleaned her plate of Blackened salmon and collared greens so I'm sure that was pretty good too! My meal, the seafood jambalaya, was just awesome. A big helping of crawfish, shrimp, chicken sausage, and mussels mixed together in Cajun rice was enough to fill any man up. The mac and cheese I chose as a side was good and deffinitely made from scratch. At the end of the meal the kind hostess offered us a free dessert to try and I chose the banana foster. It was tasty but a little runny. Not gunna complain though much, it was free! We all really enjoyed our meals and deffinitely will be back!",

The ambiance was relaxed and casual with a seat yourself approach at the front door.  The menu offered plenty of tasty cajun options including the standard jumbalaya and po' boy sandwiches.  I enjoyed the fact that they had a long list of classic southern sides to choose from on the menu (however corn bread, one of my favorites at cajun restaurants, is not included in this list).  I ordered the pimento grilled cheese sandwich with a side of collard greens.  My meal was delicious.  The pimento cheese had quite a kick to it and my nose was running by the end of the meal.  My husband ordered the seafood jumbalaya.  He's long been in search for the best jumbalaya in Charlotte and has ordered it at several restaurants only to be disappointed.  He actually seemed to enjoy it at this restaurant even though it was served with mussels which is usually outside of his seafood range.   The service was decent despite the fact that only one waitress was serving the entire restaurant by herself.  I liked that I was able to get a to-go cup for my tea when we were leaving.  It made up for the fact that they didn't offer splenda in their repertoire of sweeteners on the table.",

I notice especially with the side dishes, the collard greens are ALWAYS overcooked, the macaroni and cheese is always a different consistency.  When they fry things it's never cooked all the way though there are always uncooked parts of the batter that they use and on top of that they are moderately expensive for inconsistent food. I have decided its best that we part ways. Oh and the management is rude and never speaks to anyone. I will NOT be going back!",

    "text": "Creole cooking - the largest mystique of my culinary curiosity. Sure, I've eaten a lot of weird shit; it's a trait that comes with shoving an item in your mouth as your first method of solving general curiosity. But Cajun food... how does it work? What the hell is in it that is supposed to make it so good? My general impression of Cajun food is that people, living in a swamp their whole lives, lived off dredging the bottom of river beds and boiling or frying whatever came up. Usually when people are faced with the most unusual ingredients, then they'll work their hardest to make it taste good, and there came the allure. Creole became my culinary unicorn.  Living in New England, I didn't stand a chance at finding any creole. I read up on it a lot, but also couldn't find a lot of the ingredients, like a gumbo file or crawfish.  When I moved to Charlotte, I had my first Cajun experience at the Cajun Queen. I split a seafood etouffee. While not holding the spice I was hoping for, it was pretty good all the same.   Thusly.... we come to the Cajun Yard Dog. It was an interesting night to go. I had loaded up on margaritas and wasn't feeling all that hungry for the fried oyster po'boy I had been eyeing on the interweb for months, so instead went for the gumbo.   I got the wrong damn gumbo. I wanted seafood gumbo, because chicken, sausage and rice doesn't interest me, and it was in a beef broth, not seafood stock, so it wasn't particularly to my liking. For what it was, though, it was pretty good. I was expecting something much thicker, however. There was a spicy tang at the end, but not much of a flavorful palate to begin with.  We did start off with the fried artichoke/okra/calamari app, and that was pretty good, but standard fare. Their 'remoulade,' as a lot of people have pointed out, really tastes like mayonnaise and cocktail sauce slightly stirred together. Not impressed.   One person I was with got the crawfish etouffee, but it wasn't as flavorful as the one at the Cajun Queen, not to mention that there was too much rice and it overwhelmed the sauce. Also, the collards were undercooked.   The last item that didn't disappoint, was that my friend got a blackened chicken po'boy. This was a frickin' huge sandwich, and the chicken was cooked well, was spicy, and had huge slices of tomato with lots of lettuce on flavorful bread. The one thing that I really wanted turned out to be the only really good thing at the table.   Bottom line:   The atmosphere was friendly, and the service was good. For food, stick with the po'boys. I am definitely going back because I need a fried oyster po'boy! Everything else that I experienced... I'd want to go elsewhere.",

Although small inside, the atmosphere is jumping with everything \"southern\" and \"Louisiana\" on the walls.  The waitstaff is very friendly and have great recommendations for first timers. The jalapeno deviled eggs are an excellent starter. For lunch I always get the Catfish Po Boy with sweet potato fries.  For dinner the red beans and rice entree is my favorite.  Be sure to save room for Chocolate Pecan Pie or take it to go. Good beer and wine selection too.",

    "text": "This place is as close to True Cajun Cooking as I have experienced since I left Louisiana!  I had the Chicken Jambalaya with Mac n Cheese on my first visit and it left me with definate desire to return.  The Jambalaya is exactly the way I had it Down in LA.  Who DAT?  The Cajun Yard Dog is Dat!  The texture and the Flavors were right on mark.  It was an explosion of different flavors going off on my taste buds!  Not just a meal, an eating experience!  After all isn't that what we all want when we go out to eat.  Well you will find it here.  The Mac n Cheese is to die for.  It is very similar to my wifes Mac n Cheese and I absolutely love her Mac n Cheese.  Creamy, Rich and the pasta cooked just right, tender buit not soft and mushy.  Delicious! My wife had the Fried Catfish with Jalapeno tartar, fried Okra and Red Beans and rice!  I sampled each of her items and this is my opinion of them.  The Catfish was nothing short of amazing!  Very Crispy on the outside and light and fluffy inside with a hint of spice(heat) in the batter. Mouthwatering by itself but the Jalapeno Tartar made it pop!  The fried okra was just like Mama made it!  Delicious!  The Red Beans and Rice were so good It'd make you want to slap your Mama!  A perfect blend of seasonings and spice to drive your taste buds wild!  The best Red Beans and Rice I have ever had and I have had plenty. I asked the waitress how the Gumbo was and she quickly brought me a sample.  It was just like I had expected.  Right on the money!  All thier dishes are made fresh daily and have the flavor and feel of a homecooked meal.  The atmosphere is upbeat and vibrant with that small romantic New Orleans Cafe feeling!  Awesome for a lunch date or any occasion.  To sum things up, I had an outstanding meal with a decent price in a comfortable environment.  What else could you want.  My family and I will definately be back!  WHO DAT?  WE DAT!",

We are regulars too, but we do not expect special treatment.  Isn't a wait a good sign of a great restaurant with excellent food and terrific service??    I cannot speak more highly of the food.  I absolutely LOVE their cajun dishes and always end the meal with a dessert (the chocolate/pecan pie is my favorite!).    I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal in an awesome atmosphere.",

    "text": "This place's menu held much promise for me, but was quite a disappointment.  I've only been there once, but there was a common characteristic running through all their food that was hard to ignore...no seasoning!  I love Cajun food, primarily because I enjoy the type of food and the spices.  At CYD, you can find all your favorites on the menu; just don't look for them to be properly seasoned.  Jalepeno Deviled Eggs:  there was an essence of jalapeno but absolutely no kick...and no salt.  Just a bland deviled egg.  Fried Oysters:  A little too greasy and absolutely no seasoning in the batter.  I'll go so far to say that they were the most bland fried oysters I've ever been served.  My sides were \"all day green beans\" (bland), collards (bland), and slaw (bland).  The quality of food was pretty good.  Just don't look for authentic cajun flavor here.  Maybe I hit them on a bad day, but you'd think that I would've liked something here...but not so much.  Seriously...salt, cayenne, and peppers are pretty cheap.  CYD ought to invest five bucks and give these a try.",

    "text": "Thumbs way up: a variety of Abita to choose from, including root beer for the kiddies. Thumbs kinda downish: gumbo that smells and tastes like pepper gravy and BBQ shrimp that don't seem BBQ'd at all. More like stirred up in some tomatoes in a pan. Thumbs really really down: zydeco mardi gras hell atmosphere I know you are never gonna get real Cajun, Louisiana cooking in the Carolinas or elsewhere, but why? Why is it that even people FROM Louisiana can't open a place in another city and have it be authentic? It's like there is an Authenticity Force Field around south Louisiana.  I am giving this place 3 stars because of the Abita and the fabulous appetizer called the Calamari Okrachokie (fried okra, calamari and artichokes with a sort of Cane's sauce, if you know what I mean) and the perfectly breaded and fried catfish filet. It's harder than you think to fry stuff in a truly appetizing way. And the very friendly and accommodating staff gets my appreciation as well.",

I rolled with it all till the end but If you don't mind being rushed to order by a no patience, rather be somewhere else waitress(which you  have empathy with at first)  who brings you food and forks but no napkins and then seater who points out the  $18.00 dish he brought you is missing its side and he will bring it later but never does, and no ever comes and checks on you (so you never have a chance to remind anyone) and then this hurry up waitress leaves you waiting ten minutes for the to go box never asking how the meal was, then you catch the seater walking by  as we were putting the food in the to go box and let him know that he forgot our side,  his response was a glib  non apologetic do want some to go, I said hell no, now its about me saying \"hell no\" vs the bad service we received, i quickly apologized to the guy so I wouldn't have to smack him. then waited another 15 minutes for my credit card back. Food was ok, some sides were cold, don't know if they were meant to be(rice and beans-maybe?) So go there if you don't mind there expectation of you being an efficient customer(because they are busy), than receive inefficient service with cold overpriced missing food.",

I have to say they were not bad. The fried chicken was good and they do something really special with their cabbage that I have never seen but made it really good. My girls 7 and 9yrs had the mac n cheese and loved it. The red beans were luck warm when they came to our table and tasted can. The seafood was OK but could use a little more seasoning (you know how we like our seasoning). The service was also good the waitress was very nice.",
