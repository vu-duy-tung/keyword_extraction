It didn't take long for the food to come , but one person in our party didn't receive their food until everyone else was doing eating , which is ridiculous. Great place just not in Sunday's before sell out Saturday",

In ordered some grilled shrimp n scallops. Everyone knows it doesn't take that long to make either one of those. After doing mins of waiting, I asked the waitress how much longer it would as ppl with big families had already received their order.  she just smiled and a weirdish way and said \"I'll go check.\" I was then told my items were being cooked on a \"different\" and would take a little longer than other food items. Long story short, I canceled the order and took my business to another seafood restaurant near by where I got my food within an acceptable time frame, hot, and delicious!!! Won't be coming back here anymore. After realizing how many other options are out there with better customer service, I'm Glade Charlotte is a big city with plenty of seafood places. If you don't treat you customers rite...there are other options out there...just saying",

What isn't good is telling customers at 5:40 you're not seating anyone else after 6. The restaurant closes at 8. If I show up almost 2.5 hours before closing to be told the only way they'll take my order is to go something needs to change. Why stop seating 2 hours before close? Make that clear on your website so people like myself don't waste their time, energy, and gas to get there!!!! The consolation prize offered was I could get it go. By the time I get home all my food will be cold and I'm not paying $60 to eat crab legs in my car in your parking lot surrounded by weeds. Get your service right.

I asked why the floors were wet being that they opened at 11am but it was about 1pm. The response was that they had a spill...... so the entire building something spilled? From the front door to the back, to the bathrooms ? Seemed like the shift the night before didn't clean. One of the hostess picked someone kid up to make sure they wouldn't fall because the floors were soaking wet. The food is pretty decent. Portion size is inconsistent though. It seems like the take out orders are piled up but dining in you don't get nearly as much for the price . I think once they work some kinks out they have potential to be a nice establishment. One employee literally said something like it's a black restaurant, what you expect ? That was weird. Maybe some training should be in the near future . You should overly exceed expectations black or not. Black is not an indication of lacking as that employee implied . Im rooting for them.",

You really need to plan for a huge crowd every weekend. I suggest taking the amount needed for your biggest platter and make the projection that 75% of your typical amount of customers would order this platter and you would come close to ensuring a great experience for the majority of your customers. Also don't be so lazy even as you near shutting down( it was approximately an hr and a half left to go before 7), that you don't want to clean your fryers and replenish them with fresh oil so your customers food doesn't taste like old grease.

We decided to wait because they said we had a party of 7 and 20 ahead of us. We then waited for almost 45mins, when went back to the host and she said \"oh your table is ready\" but we never received a text. Also, the host ordered pizza in front of the patrons from Pizza Hut and was rude to the delivery guy. This was my first time at this place and I will never go back. The food may be good but the service out ways the food. My nephew has a food allergy and they told us that they fry everything including the chicken wings in the fish grease.

Fried shrimp was pretty dried out and tasted like breaded chicken, probably due to the thick coating of cornmeal/batter & having to cook it too long??   Fried fish barely had fish..mostly cornmeal/batter.  They did bring me a grilled piece which was much better.  A lot of spices/herbs but it was ok.  Fries seasoned way too much & weren't fresh.  Hush puppies were just ok.  For a $40 meal we were faaaar from impressed.  Once served we had to waived down anyone we could find for drink refills. With the loud music (which was actually good selection) I felt like I was out clubbing.  Watch for the slippery painted floor...don't wear heels, you'll leave with a broken ankle!  I won't be back.  Not impressed. Gets a 2 only because crab legs & tea were good.",

The food offerings reminded us of a place in the Atlanta, Ga area called What's Crackin. They do garlic crabs and shrimp boils and serve large portions.  Seafood Connection was not nearly as good in comparison. We had the Super C Port, which was $65.  The shrimp was mushy... normally my favorite... but i ate only one.  The crabs and lobster were fair. There was only 1 piece of sausage in the plate and 2 pieces of corn.  And the rest of the plate was potatoes.  Perhaps my view is skewed because What's Crackin has better food and a better value for the money. Seafood Connection was okay but we won't go back.  If you are in the ATL, check out What's Crackin on Candler Road and you will \"taste\" the difference and your meal will be less expensive but still very filling with seafood, more sausage and corn versus potatoes.",

Why share a kitchen in such a horrible restaurant? It seems so dirty. With so much hype, I still decided to go for it. I ordered the fish and crab rice. It was just Ok. The second time, I ordered salmon... just Ok. I didn't even finish it. The food is overpriced if you ask me and they use a LOT salt, and spread not real butter. Customer service is lacking. The girl took my order and once I paid I decided to just go with the combo and she told me it was too late my order was sent to the kitchen already. It had been a split second, nobody else in line, she could have gone out of the way if she wanted to. For these reasons I most likely won't eat there again. But just so the business knows, I have referred about 5 people that eat there regularly and I wish them luck.",

    "text": "I wish I could give a 1.5, but I can't. I'm trying to figure out where these other reviewers ate so I can find this GREAT seafood they're raving about. I have visited this place twice. Fool me once-shame on you. Fool me twice-can't put the blame on you! My first visit I didn't even order because the line was RIDICULOUSLY long, I asked a woman and her adult son how long they waited-she told me 3 hours! WHAT? I'm not even at the DMV for 3 hours. Needless to say, I left. So yesterday *insert face palm emoji* I decided to give it another shot, I had to know if the bark was equivalent to the bite. After waiting, and waiting to order I received dry customer service. After waiting over an hour (for steamed seafood) I asked if I could get my money back, the other patrons were looking at me as if I was insulting their mother. The person at the register kept giving me the run around and magically my food was ready. I saw someone else mention they have a cult following, ha! It's True. I'm sorry but I just can't see spending my hard earned money and waiting long enough to finish half of a Netflix series, time and time again. These people wait for hours on end for a mediocre, at best, dining experience. The food was not all that! I've been cracking crabs, throwing back shrimp, shucking oysters since I was 3! No exaggeration. So I KNOW good seafood. I'm not going to front, it smelled delicious from the box. However, upon opening it I immediately recognized the \"butter\" as a Parkay type imitation. The shrimp seasoning was nothing but garlic salt-beware if you are a sufferer of high blood pressure. The potatoes were flavorless, sausage under cooked, the eggs and corn were the best part! I'm not hard to please by any means, I've eaten at some sketchy hole-in-the-wall places and received better food and service. If you're thinking of going here, stop...you can prepare a much better seafood boil at home for less $$ and time. Please GET IT TOGETHER, Seafood Connection.",

I had to watch 10 more people (19 people in all) get their food before me and wait an additional 30 minutes. I am a very patience person and I understand that things happen but customer service is vital to me; no one acknowledge the mistake or apologize.

    "text": "I heard about Seafood Connection about a year ago from my ecstatic son. He was apparently visiting a friend when the friend's girlfriend arrived home complaining about the one hour wait to receive good from Seafood Connection. This was when they were first operating out of the church parking lot. She had two orders of the C-note. But once they opened the boxes and started eating, all of that stress melted away. I finally arrived last Friday along with my sister. Their website said the hours were 11:30am-8pm but their Facebook page stated 12pm-8pm. Be sure to check their Facebook page for correct hours. We arrived around 11am after a trip to the Charlotte Regional farmers market and parked in the shade right in front of the King of Spicy bldg. Ppl began pulling up at around 11:30. We quickly got out and entered. There were already two young women sitting around the bar waiting and perusing their phones. So that meant that we were #3 in line. Order time was 12:05, at which point there was probably 20 other ppl there in line behind us. You jump up when the cashier says ok, taking orders now and basically line up around the bar in the order you arrived. We ordered two C-note, one Lock-in, an order of fried shrimp and a order of fried oysters. Total was $121. They have extra butter sauce behind the bar and several ppl ordered it but you really don't need bcuz ur dinner is smothered in the stuff. To end, that C-note was 3 meals for me!! So much food and so fresh and delicious!!!. Ppl will pay for quality and quantity also at Seafood Connection. I'm planning another visit this week. You surely won't be disappointed.",

I will probably ask for light sauce next time I go because it was a little much for me but I wanted the full experience the first time I went. The best parts of my platter were the corn, potatoes, shrimp and lobster. I was not a fan of the crab legs, but I don't tend to like crab legs anyways (too much work!).  I don't understand people complaining about the wait. The wait is no different than eating at Red Lobster or Olive Garden and their food is prepared to order.  Love this place and will definitely return!",

We came at a lucky time, there were about 5 people in line ahead of us, the wait to order was about 6 minutes and just enough time for us to decide what we want.  There were 3 of us, my mom and I shared the steamed crab and shrimp meal (forget the name on the menu, it had 2 crab legs and like 12 shrimp) and my stepdad ordered a fried fish platter. They offer water and sweet tea as drink options.   The steamed meal came out first, ahead of the Other meal by about 10 minutes. I took a picture but after my mom scooped a couple shrimp and her crab so it's a little light in the photo but the lid of the container couldn't even close. It was DELICIOUS. Absolutely no way to improve unless they could add something to help break the crab with bc it was a little labor intensive. It could have fed 3-4 people. We left many shrimp and barely got to touch the potato and corn. Everything was amazing.   We didn't pay much attention to my stepdads meal but he said it was delicious and he can be difficult to please so that carries some weight.   Oh my mom just said we ordered the \"super combo\"",

Potato is not a vegetable, corn is not a vegetable and PORK SAUSAGE is not a vegetable. I then asked if I could do a substitute broccoli and take off the sausage and they said no. You guys suck. You False advertise a veggie plate and don't allow anyone to make any changes. Now, my meat eating friends all said the crab legs, shrimp and fish were amazing, but their only complaint was that the floors were sticky and the roof was leaking. Most of us decided we will not dine there again. I suggest doing a simple google search and learn what a vegetable is.",

Maybe I ordered the wrong?!? We got the super combo with an order of hushpuppies.  The hushpuppies were the savory kind. They had onions in them. They were overcooked and not good at all.   The potatoes were mushy and not classic red potatoes which are what should be used in Frogmore Stew. The corn tasted the best. There was one ity bity sausage in each of our boxes.   The shrimp wasn't anything special. They were large and plentiful. They were also streamed and drowned in fake butter. My crabs were soooo bland. They were cold and tasteless.   Service was okay. I can tell that they are understaffed.   Experienced seafood cooks/eaters can totally do this yourself. It's way too overpriced for the disappointment.",

I didn't expect such good customer service especially from a place that was so busy. I also didn't expect to get my food so quickly. My receipt says 6:22 and when I got out the parking lot it was 6:37!!! When they called my name for my order I couldn't believe it, because it didn't feel like I had been there long at all. By the time I got home my food was still warm and just as delicious as if I ate it right out the pot. I will DEFINITELY be back and I recommend this place to everyone! I got the Super Combo and it was SUPER FILLING!",

    "text": "Visit Date: 3/10/2018  First time here after all the Hype around Charlotte about this place   FOOD & SERVICES: I had the C-Port Platter for $40 with extra butter sauce. IT WAS REALLY GOOD!! OMG WAS IT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I was gonna eat it the restaurant. It was a very long wait for my food which I understand. BUT when I got my food, parts of my crabs was cold and the shrimp was mins away from also being cold, I don't mind waiting for my food because I know it's freshly cooked BUT WHEN MY FOOD COMES AND ITS NOT HOT AND I HAVE WAITED 30 MINS PLUS FOR MY FOOD THATS A PROBLEM. Mind you at that time I was going to dine in. The waitress took my food back to warm it back up and I asked her to just bag it up to go. The service to the table is a bit slow. I don't think each service have certain tables because about 2 to 3 different PPL stop it my table and asked have someone helped(which is a good thing). Now would I go back ......YES I WILL HANDS DOWN! I HAVE ALREADY PLANNED THE DATE LOL. Hopefully things will be better. Everyone have off days.   INSIDE: it's pretty big and they have their logo on all the tables. It's a pretty good vibe. They have a good music playing. Yes the lines are long. When I got there it was just like 5 people ahead of me BUT when I was leaving (around 3:30 ish) that line was OUT THE DOOR! They also have a stage. I wonder if they have ppl preforming there sometimes?   THE PROCESS: You pay for your food at front when you walked in (thats why the line is long like that). It would be helpful if it's your first time, to look at the menu before getting there, so it will help the line move faster. After you pay, the host will take you to your table. Then you will get your food. Now the food is cooked when your order. So keep in mind that it's not fast food. If you are in a rush you might want to call in your order and get it to go. They will bring your food in a Togo box (yes even if you dine in). Which is cool especially if you don't eat all your food.   TOGO ORDER: YES YOU STILL HAVE TO STAND IN THAT LINE. BUT YOU WILL GO TO THE BAR TO PICKUP YOUR ORDER.",

I asked the waitress where was my food she said it's alway an hour to get your food. Oh boy ! When  I finally get my so called Super boat it was flooded with butter and garlic ! Every place I ever eaten seafood the butter was served on the side ! They poured all  that butter and garlic right on top. I almost threw up in my paper plate ! Lastly, I asked the waiter upfront how much was my order he stated 65 dollars . When I got my bill is was 75 plus an 18% gratuity! I ask the waitress about the 10 dollar difference and she said It's All Star weekend we increased the prices ! Not telling the customers, isn't price gauging against the law ! They don't ever have to worry about me coming back ! I traveled this entire  country and this restaurant was the worst horrible place I ever experienced!",

If patrons are to wait an hour to two hours for food, it should be piping hot when you receive it. Most of our food was room temperature or cold when we got it. I never saw any type of manager or leader running the restaurant. We had to eat with plastic forks and knives. How do you eat crab legs with plastic forks. When I asked the waitress, which was excellent, for a fork she said she could not find one. There were no lemons. They had lemonade on the menu but was out.

Hostess & Waitress was very nice. The food was delicious. I'll come back to order the grilled or steamed platters. The music was a little loud in the restaurant. While placing our order the hostess had to walkie~talkie them in the back to lower it down...so she could hear her customers. But a great experience over all. For dine in Everything is packed in to go boxes brought to you,styrofoam cups. Condiments on the table are single packets of sauces, plastic packaging of utensils, wet wipes for your hands.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that it truly hurts my heart to have to write this review. I've wanted to visit this restaurant for so long and the whole experience fell way below what I've heard and what I expected. I'm constantly out of town on the weekends due to my career so when I saw through their instagram that they would be open on a thursday, I made sure I was one of many waiting at the doors before they even opened. A close friend I decided to go with has been here several times and has raved about how great the food is every time. After waiting about 10 minutes past opening time, they opened the doors to begin serving everyone. If you're dining in, let this be a warning that they do not take refunds and you MUST pay before you take a seat. This also means you MUST order. The menu isn't too huge, so it shouldn't take you long. I decided to get the steamed C-Port Platter (Comes with 1 cluster of crabs, 1 lobster, 10-12 jumbo shrimp, potatoes, corn, & sausage). It came out to a total of $43 that I would soon regret spending. As soon as we sat down, our waitress verified our orders on the receipt and took our drink orders. My friend & I both ordered waters. After 10 minutes, the water were brought to us. My friend then proceeded to ask for lemons for her water. The waitress told us that she would check to see if they had any. After she walked away, my friend & I looked at each other confused thinking the same exact thing. What kind of SUCCESSFUL seafood restaurant doesn't have lemons??? After our waitress \"looked\" for the lemons and couldn't \"find\" them, she returned & said these words verbatim, *nods head as approaching the table* \"We don't have any lemons, if I could go to food lion & get them for you I would\". We said okay and she continued to address a table behind us. It was clearly a friend of hers as they exchanged hugs and a couple of giggles. This customer came after us, received his food before us, AND received lemons with his drink + food WITHOUT having to ask. Before the runner that delivered his food could return to the kitchen I stopped him and asked for a few lemons as well. As he returned to the kitchen, You could clearly see from our table where the lemons were. He cut a few and brought them to us immediately. A few minutes later we received our food and I regret not taking a picture. I felt so cheated compared to what they advertise on instagram. I was expecting a savory sauce and instead received a dry rub on everything. To make matters worse, my lobster and shrimp were overcooked. They both tasted mushy yet gritty due to the seasoning carelessly thrown on top. The only positive thing that I can say is that you can tell the seafood was fresh. After barely eating my food I was completely ready to go. We stopped by the counter to tell the young lady about our experience. She was so helpful & tried her best to reconcile the issue. Apparently many people are complaining about their over use of the savory sauce I've seen on instagram which is why the food was as it was. She sent us off with apologies and new lobster tails & shrimp. Sad to say, they tasted the exact way of what I complained about. I appreciate the young lady at the front for at least trying to fix the issue. If my waitress was half as customer service oriented as she was, I would've actually reconsider revisiting.",

I placed my to go order with 4 other ladies. When the food was brought out, everyone received theirs except for me. I didn't make a big deal out of it, but of course I was curious to know what the hold up was. The lady who was handing out the to go orders (kim) I believe her name was, was absolutely nonchalant. I tried to grab her attention, and she actually rolled her eyes and put her finger up *YIKES*. Before she came over to me, she went to the back to grab more orders (orders of people who had ordered after me).When she finally came over, I told her the situation, and she looked and rolled her eyes again and said, \"I just give the orders out, I'll have to find someone that can find your order.\" By this time I was absolutely confused.. how hard would it have been to go simply ask the kitchen to research a lost ticket? I actually did not even care to deal with her at this point (it was a beautiful Saturday, and GOD knows I have changed my ways). So I then got the attention of the cashier who took our order. SHE WAS THE BOMB (beautiful brown skinned girl with a hat on and a bob). She actually got off the register went to the back and came back LESS than a minute later with my order. I asked her \"what is that lady's problem?\" (I was referring to the kim lady). She (Cashier lady) just shook her head, and smiled. I took that as she may simply have an attitude problem. Other people noticed and commented to me while I stood there, so I know it wasn't just me.  She (kim) may need a morale booster, because she seemed to hate her job. ** just an observation**  I pray this business grows bigger than the owner even knows, but she needs to be talked to.",

And the same things happened during both occasions, we had over a 45 minute wait which was fine because it was obviously crowded, then once we were seated the waiter took a while to come over and get our drinks. As we began to order, two of us mentioned to add a side of scallops and she goes \"oh we're out of scallops and oysters\" mind you it was only 2:30. Once we ordered it took another 45 minutes for the food to come out. I swear they try to play that loud music to distract you from how long you wait. Once our food did arrive it was as if it had been sitting out for a bit, was barely warm; though i know crab can cool down quick i still expected things to be warmer. We then had to ask for crab crackers 10 min into eating b/c we just assumed that the waiter would bring it. Our waiters on both occasions were great nonetheless. Food was good as well. The business has a lot of minor things to improve on however. And the parking lot was not only a mess, with trash but it also smelled of rotten seafood.",

I usually order the crab platter and most of the time it's absolutely delicious, actually even addicting. However recently I tried brunch and I ordered the crab cakes. The crabcakes tasted like it had too much sugar and mustard in them. I couldn't even eat a whole crab cake because of the strong flavor. However the grits were absolutely delicious. The waffles weren't homemade, it seemed like they were made with a box mix. Very dry and disappointing. I will continue to visit seafood connection my crab fix and that's about it!",

I made sure to come early in the day thanks to my other Yelpers who let me know that they run out of things quickly. I was a little alarmed that when we went to walk up to the register to order, we were yelled at and told to wait behind a line about 6 feet away until we were called over. Then, when we were called up we noticed a bouncer by the cashier....which is a little concerning, but let me remind you that this is a hole in the wall, and hey! hole in walls often have the best food. Well, everything myself and my group wanted to order was sold out. EVERYTHING. Also, this is cash only AND the ATM was broken....which made a lot of people leave. The food is pricey, but it is seafood. However, due to being a hole in the wall, you do expect a little cheaper prices. We were unable to order ANYTHING we wanted and it was only 11 am.... they were very unapologetic, so we did not have a great experience this time but I would love to come again to try it. There must be a reason it was all sold out, right?!",

Went once and won't be going back, the food overall was somewhat good but I'm not paying anyone those kind of prices to be given plastic eating utensils and have my food delivered to the table in a take out styrofoam container.  I was told that this restaurant used to be run from a food truck, so OK I would expect that type of service.  But once you move into a sit down establishment and charge prices like that, you need to step it up, presentation is everything. The fork that you're given is the cheap ones that you get at the chinese take-out places (fork, knife and mini napkin in a plastic bag).  Are they serious? I asked my server, \"is this what I'm supposed to eat with\"?, and she said that was all they had. (WOW).  My total bill was $42.22 before tip and that was just for myself.  If you want to patronize them and pay big bucks like that to eat out of styrofoam go right ahead.  When I dine out and pay over $50 with tip, I want to feel pampered and Seafood Connection doesn't pamper you.  I'll head to Harris Tweeter and grab me some crab legs and make them in my kitchen for a lot cheaper and I can throw in a bottle of wine and I still haven't hit $50 bucks! And I'll feel pampered!",

I had been telling myself for weeks that I was going to make time to visit their new location being that they are in the university area now. I waited until my day off which was Friday to visit and was sure to get there exactly when they opened which was 11:am just so I wouldn't have to wait. There was one person ahead of me and we both were taken care of quickly. I ordered 2 fried shrimp and fish plates with hush puppy and fries, a pint of crab rice and pepper and onions. My order was $50. As I waited I noticed others were gradually coming through the door. 20 min goes by and the one guy before gets his food & leave. At this point it's me and like 4 other people waiting. Another 15 min go by and 3 people get their food. So at this point 35 has went by and the lady had the nerve to say that fried food takes longer as if it really takes 35 min to cook fried seafood. I felt like my ticket had been lost or something. At this point 5 more people has came in and their orders were taken. I lie to you not, another 15 min goes by and the young lady goes to back and comes back out with everyone's order, this time including mine. My order was WRONG so I asked to speak to a manager immediately. He comes out and hears me out and ask me if I wanted another plate. I told him that I've already waited 50 min. I won't wait any longer. Then he mentioned to the cashier to give me 20% off my next order and walked away. He did not care to apologize. The cashier decided 25% would be better as if I planned to come back which I do not so I declined and told her I'll take the plate that the manager offered so I can be on my way. She goes to the back and brings out a plate with crab legs, steamed shrimp, corn and some other things. They didn't care to ask me what I wanted. At this point, I am so upset. I could cry. I felt so disrespected. The audacity! I do not even eat crab legs! Had I not talked to my boyfriend I would have requested a refund for sure but I just took the food and left. I felt like my energy had been drained. When I got home, I wasn't even hungry but I ate because my bf paid for it. I had to saute the rice and peppers and onions with teriyaki island sauce cause they both were bland and the rice had too much pepper. I was very disappointed and will never go there again. Had those other 10 people not gotten their food before me, I probably wouldn't have been so upset cause I know how the wait there can be but I was there when the doors opened and was the second to order my food and was the 11th person to get their food. It's no excuse. The establishment cares nothing about customer service or customer complaints.",

Food so good, I saw a lady almost stab her sister who was reaching for a shrimp!!!!  Only 1 word describes the flavor... #Rediculous!!!! Crazy good food, decent price, definitely worth the wait. Everything is good but my absolute favorite is the C-port platter (10-12 shrimp, crab leg cluster, and 1 lobster tail (best fried), with potatoes, corn, and a boiled egg (if your lucky) dipped in the \"special seasonings\"... $40. I went to Publix and tried to recreate this box of bold taste and it costs me over $100 and the great taste of Seafood Connection. Never Again!

The food was great, and we could have easily shared one order.  You definitely get a healthy serving of great tasting food.  I did want to try the scallops, but they were not available except on weekends.  Our food was ready in about 15 minutes or less.  There is a bar area, but doesn't serve alcohol at this point.  We did takeout, but there were plenty of tables available, had we decided to eat in. You do put your order in at the front, but that was no issue.   Of course on weekends that might not be the case, based on the volume of business this place gets.  We were very pleased overall, and the staff treated us perfectly.",

Our waitress was new and she was very pleasant. She took our drink orders and then came back to take our food orders. We placed our orders around 220. Around 330 were wondering where our food is. Another waitress with an ipad comes over as she has noticed we have been sitting there for quite some time and ask did anyone take our order. We tell her yes and she ask did they put it in the ipad and did we pay. We didnt because no one told us that was part of the policy. So we asked for a manager. The manager/owner from what she told us attitude about fixing the problem was ill put a rush on it. We asked her if anything would be taken off of the bill or if she would compensate us with an appetizer or extra food or just any thing for the inconvenience and her answer was a stern no. We advised that it was a very pleasant experience to see multiple tables of people who came in after us eating and we were still sitting there. We advised that since our waitress was new someone should have been making sure she knew how things worked. Her response was DONT TIP HER!   This really upset me. Cuz as a business owner you should want to make sure your employees are doing a good job and are happy. It also upset me because she wanted to make sure she was getting all of her money but didnt care if her server was paid. At that point i was done.  We waited another 10-15 mins for our food and i cant even lie the food was good. It was very flavorful, the only downside was it was sitting in a pool of butter.",

This is a cash only restaurant, but they have an ATM in the front of the restaurant. Even though you can dine in, I always take my food home. And each time, I find they left something out. Every platter comes with corn, potatoes and sausage, I have been short a sausage or corn nothing major like a crab leg so I will still return. The portions are huge so you can share or have leftovers. They are only open Friday, Saturday and Sunday which sucks because they are so good, I can eat there everyday.

It's corn, potatoes (hello carbs) and 10 or so peel and eat shrimp along with beef sausage and a boiled egg.  The flavor and freshness is on point - yes it can be greasy but note you can ask them to go easy on spices and/or butter.  But why??  I budget this meal into my new healthy lifestyle.  Prices are fair and I've never had issue with customer service.    My first visit to the new location in King of Spicy was Easter (Yes they were open Easter!).  I get the bouncer for security but it was still off putting.  There must be  a lot of cash floating around as it's an all cash venture at this point.  The snow crab clusters are also the bomb.  I'm so happy to see this place thriving.  I've noticed a definite uptick in professionalism too since the addition of Yeshika and Von Juan,  Both of these folks manage the social media and are always engaging - taking the good and the bad.  Only reason I didn't give five stars is my ONE beef.  I'd pay more for deviened shrimp.  I budget for the calories, but still have issue getting over the lack of deviening.  That being said the shrimp last time was perfectly cooked and not mealy.  Just i don't wanna eat shrimp poop.  Sorry to be gross.",

As I was peeling mine I could see the brown oozing out of the end of the shrimp..... gross. It also took nearly 2 hours for our to go order to be filled. I am also not a fan of eating out of a box when I sit down to eat. Disposing of all of that styrofoam daily is definitely not good for the environment. Over all: clean environment, spotty service, decent food, get some real plates please.",

I heard many great things about this place, so I came here for the first time with my friend (who has never gone here before) and we lost our minds. So much food, very flavorful, and for a decent price. I plan to make it my mission to come back every weekend just for the shrimp/crab combo. Definitely makes any seafood platter I've had in Maryland taste like trash lol.",

    "text": "The waitress was very nice and professional. This place is awful. First, we had a 45 min wait we expected that from reading previous reviews. But to wait 45 mins to get a table and another 20-25 mins to have our drink and food order  placed and another 8-10 to have the waitress come to tell you they are out of  legs we ordered 4 crab and shrimp platter oh and by the way they were out of sausage and dont substitute anything to replace them  each platter cost $25.00 dollars so you would think they would at least offer you a choice of more potatoes,corn or shrimp not. So I say all of that to say its  bad customer service all the way around. To advertise that you are open until 7 pm and run out of food well before then is crazy the kitchen staff should be aware off how much food they have and how many orders they can fill before running out of food basically you could have told us at 430 you were out of crab legs and we would have been on our way. I lived in Savannah for 15 years and loved the seafood from there so I was really was looking forward to some Good eats but I will wait until I visit the C-port and hit up David's Seafood never disappoints and much cheaper. I wish you guys the best but you have a lot of work to do before I would consider visiting your business again when you know better you do better! Poor Management!",

The customer service, food and even the bathrooms were  spot on top notch. spoke to management and found out they were in the planning stage to open a spot in the UNIVERSITY AREA North Charlotte. So excited   So sad to come to a business that really needs training on customer service. Starting with the Host being rude and not sitting empty areas causing a 1-2 hour wait. I've been a host before and didn't understand why so many empty tables yet a long wait. When seated we had to wait again no apology no formal greeting just a list of things on the menu that you are told they ran out oysters and chicken tenders. Now you wait for your food that is over loaded in butter sauce shrimp rubbery and mushy (that is old or reheated) and cold . Waited 40mins for cold food that arrived same time as my appetizer. Still no manager to ask how is the meal. Asked for crab cracker that I can tell was not washed and noticed it is shared by customers. I Spent a total of 3.5 hours and had to flag down a server to get refills several times. Lots of playing around by servers I heard one cursing to another. I became nauseous during my meal I couldn't even  eat it all. It's very sad because the last restaurant that was in that location had similar issues. Get it together seafood connection!",

    "text": "I'm new to the state and I picked this restaurant for my birthday celebration. We went on a Friday at 4pm. Paying for your meal before you sit down did throw me for a loop, but I wasn't deterred. I ordered the (steamed) Connect Platter [lobster and crab legs]. My friend ordered the (fried) C-Port Platter [shrimp, lobster, crab legs]. There weren't any disposable bibs; just a roll of paper towel on the table that you use to drape on your collar and hope you don't ruin your clothes.  My friend's fried meal came out first, and my steamed entree didn't come to my table until 40 minutes later! I, the birthday girl, was waiting for my food to come last. Almost a hour full of repeat excuses as to why she didn't know what was taking so long. Absurd.   The waitress assured me that my food would be coming out shortly about 4x. She even brought me a seafood salad with crackers during her 4th time to the table to apologize for my long wait. During her 5th visit to the table to tell me my food would be coming out next, I expressed how dissatisfied I was with how long my food in particular was taking. She apologized profusely.  The utensils they provide you with are the cheap and bendable buy-in-bulk plastic fork and knife/napkin/salt n pepper packet kind. The waitress also didn't have any crab crackers \"because we ran out of clean ones\". How does one break open a crab leg or pull out lobster from the tail with subpar utensils? No crab crackers for a seafood restaurant?!   Our meals tasted good but the slow cook time and lack of management and cut on resources was ridiculous. The way they drench the seafood in butter, you would think they would give the bare minimum of a disposable bib. The Instagram pictures will bring you in, the service won't bring you back.",

    "text": "I know folks love to say...\"well, I'm from ABC\" or \"I'm from XYZ\" so I know tacos. I know seafood. Here's my homage to such:   I'm from Louisiana and I know to tell y'all.... 1) I don't care for poop in my shellfish. Deveined isn't optional and I generally roll with it outside of Louisiana. Even more accepting with small businesses. My point: they didn't DEVEIN the shrimp so that little BLACK line around the backside of the shrimp is POOP.   2) Alternatively, I've spent enough time in Wisconsin to truly and genuinely appreciate BUTTER over Margarine. Margarine is SYNTHETIC and since they dump a lot...and I mean A LOT on top of the shellfish - I would genuinely and sincerely advise: Order anything without the use of \"buttah\"   3) I won't go on about the service. I will congratulate these folks for setting up shop and outpacing the Indian restaurant that used to be here. I waited for 100+ reviews before adding mine in order to avoid lowering their stars.   4) Oh! And someone could lay off some of the salt on that fried lobster tail.  5) Clean up the snow crab legs or consider buying live crabs and killing them a certain way (as there are a multitudes) then the gunk won't be in the meaty area.  6) The potatoes I had were brown Russett not new red skin potatoes. I chalked it up to maybe that's their budget or how things are done around the Carolina's.   7) I don't need the boiled egg.  The sausage is pork based not wholly beef.   8) Glad I found it via social media and will try any place with a fried lobster tail.   9) Here's to hoping things really take off and then maybe we'll get True authentic Butter. Even the no-name HT brand over this margarine. :/",

It's either horrible service or my order is short of something & I had to end up waiting even longer than the hour I already have to wait to get it fixed, or they misplace my order. Well tonight was the worst, online it states the dining room closed an hour before and the grilled/fried side closes 30 minutes prior. So I showed up tonight at 7:45pm thinking I'd be safe because I'm ordering to go and not fried or grilled. I put in my crab order, someone walks up to her, she tells me she has to cancel my order and the only thing I can order is shrimp & lobster because they do not cook crab legs an hour before closing. WHAT?!?!?! She says they dont want to pull any more out. Seriously? That needs to be posted online and even at the door before people walk in. Further more it was over an hour before closing when I walked in. Now despite the fact that they dont devein their shrimp and the lobster is typically mushy,  I love this place for crab legs and shrimp when I dont feel like cooking it myself for cheaper at home. The sauce they use is pretty flavorful. But I think I'll find somewhere else after this. I've tried to order online at grub hub but before you even add your order to the cart they add an extra 3.50 for sausage that they dont do at the location. That's in addition to the high fees at checkout. Such a scam!!",

    "text": "Seafood Connection is def the most popular seafood spot in the Queen City at the moment. I'm so glad they have a full time home in the old King of Spicy spot on Albemarle.   If you plan to come try them out plan to wait. Whether it's to sit down inside or to order to go you will wait. The togo waits seems a little shorter of a line. On my visit I chose to eat inside. From wait outside til getting our food it was about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Everything is boxed togo which makes it very convenient.   Once you get inside you place your order with a cashier at a register up front. All togo orders are paced at the bar. Then you seat yourself and have a number that you place on the table. Once you sit your sever greets you and brings your drinks. Our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.   Our fried order came out first and we were able to nibble on that until the steamed orders came out. We ordered the Fried Shrimp Plate, the Steamed Crab Plate, the Steamed Shrimp Plate and the Steamed Lock Jaw Plate.   The fried shrimp was really good. A lot of flavor and good amount of seasoning. The shrimp are also a very good size. My friends had the Crab Plate. They throughly enjoyed it but would have liked the crab pinchers to crack the shells and be able to get to more of the meat. I had the Lock Jaw Plate. It was very good. The lobster was delicious and I was able to dip the meat in the seasoned butter that was trapped in the shell. I added the season egg and it wasn't good. I would skip that. I meant to order extra sausage but forgot. Once we had started eating we noticed we didn't have any sausage with our meals at all. When we brought it to our server's attention he said they had run out about an hour ago. It would have been nice to know and perhaps given another piece of corn or something. My only other issue with the food is that all the season is on the outside of the meat which is in a shell. It would have been nice to have extra dipping sauce or seasoning for my shrimp and the crab meat. I did find some trapped under the corn but it wasn't enough.   Now there was a slight issue with the restrooms on our visit as well. The women's restroom had flooded and I was instructed to use the men's restroom. Upon entering the men's room there were 2 stalls but one didn't have a door and the other was locked so with that being said I didn't use the restroom.   Not sure if I will eat inside on my next visit or do togo but I'm sure I will be back to try the brunch and the sausage!!!

Our waitress, Brittany, was great. She got our drinks quickly and took our orders. She checked on us frequently and asked us if we were still doing okay.  We ordered steamed seafood -- the 'Shrimp and Crab Combo' and the 'Super Combo'. The food was very tasty. The steamed combos come with sweet corn (amazing!!!), baked potato, and sausage (both of our plates came with one very small piece of sausage). Definitely tear off a few paper towels before you dig in -- it'll get messy!  The sauce they pour over everything is really good; it's very salty (not a problem for me, but worth a mention!).  The main issue I had was that the food wasn't very hot. It wasn't necessarily cold, but it could have been warmer. Also, the shrimp were a bit soft (not quite mushy, but could have been more firm) -- I think I only really noticed that because of the reviews I read before we went.  Overall a good experience.

I asked for a glass for my drink, they only have plastic cups. My friend ordered the shrimp and scallops over a bed of crab rice. WTH! Plastic forks? I looked over at the next table and they ordered crab legs. They served it in a \"to go\" container ! All that money they charge for the food and they serve us like it's a food truck! Nah, I'll go back when they up their game.  2 1/2 stars.",

    "text": "3.75 stars, although having a shorter wait would easily push it to 4 stars!  A few things to get out of the way before I start:  1.) The wait will be long. 2.) It will likely be busy. 3.) You order and pay as soon as you come into the door, if dining in. If ordering for takeout, go directly to the bar area to order and wait. 4.) It is only open on the wknds, Thur-Sun.  Now onto the experience,.....the food was really good! I ordered the \"C-Port\", a steamed platter with a snow crab leg cluster, shrimp, a lobster tail, one piece of Rogerwood sausage and the typical potatoes and corn. I also ordered a side of the crab rice. The platter was full to the brim and packed with flavor, but would have done well to have a full link of sausage in it instead of just a measly half. I found myself wanting another piece of it. If you ask me they could have given half the amount of potatoes (which I ate none of by the way, b/c they were sort of an afterthought and weren't cooked softly enough) & another piece of the sausage. I would pass on the crab rice altogether, it was pretty lackluster and a bit dry,  although full of real crab. I have one MAJOR bone to pick with the seafood platter though, there was not an ounce of Old Bay seasoning anywhere! As a Philly girl, I don't understand seafood that isn't seasoned in part with Old Bay! Their seasoning is more garlic based and tangy. It was good, but man I was jonesin' for some Old Bay. I even asked the server for some...which they of course had none of.   The service was good as well. The wait after sitting down was long. It took at least 40 mins to receive my meal, and it still arrived lukewarm! But, the servers were definitely attentive and accessible and heated my food up promptly.   Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend this spot. It will definitely take care of your weekend seafood craving!",

Heard so many great things about the food, so my family and I just had to go. Food was great and loved the fact that there was actually some flavor on the shelled seafood, but after the first time, the second time wasn't that impressive. Don't get me wrong, there is some great seasoning going on in that sauce, but it may be a little too much of it. For the prices that you're paying, each customer should at least get some disposable gloves and a bib, which was not offered and when asked, was told that was not something that was available. Also the wait time is entirely too long and there is always something that they are out of.  Went on a weekend, during CIAA (which was probably a bad idea), and everything that was requested was something that they were out of.",

The butter sauce is so good you could probably eat it on popcorn or an old shoe! The fried shrimp was good as well. Tip, dip the fried shrimp in some of that butter sauce! The service was a little slow. But all in all, a great place to eat some really good seafood.",

Wait staff was abundant and polite though.  Food was hit and miss; crab legs were good, but shrimp was disgusting (on everyone's plate). Chicken was not cooked all the way.  The entire floor of the restaurant is like an ice skating rink... my girlfriend almost fell and the staff just yelled to be careful, that the floor is always slippery (lawsuit waiting to happen).  I can honestly say that I am surprised that nobody in my party was sick the next day.   Do not recommend",

We were seated right away only to wait 10 minutes without any acknowledgement whatsoever from any of the wandering staff ( which seemed to include two boys about 11 and 14years old???). We went to the hostess stand to ask which server was supposed to be assigned to our table and wouldn't you know, it was the server chatting it up with the hostess. The sever came to the table at which time we were informed that their system was down and she could only take drink orders. After about another 10 minutes she returned stating their system was back up. We are at a seafood restaurant and their menu is 90% seafood but don't get too excited because They were out of scallops, crawfish, and oysters! What?!? We settled on lobster with waffle and crab cake grits. After having to request silverware and served plastic ware, the Waffle was rubbery, lobster was tasty, grits and crab cake were very salty. As we sat waiting and eating we saw one table bussed when the person at the table had ordered and excused herself to use the bathroom only to return to an empty-cleared table, additionally three orders were brought out to the wrong tables, by the way the area we were in had about 12 tables so that's an error rate of 25% in one hour! Perhaps they were better off as a food truck??? Will not be returning.",

The crab rice was a mixture of old and fresh rice (hard rice grains and clumps of old rice). It was truly a waste of my $26 and my 35 minute wait time! Then hours later when I received my receipt via email, I discovered they added an unauthorized $1.00 tip. I lined out the tip on the receipt and put the total order at the bottom when I signed it. Tried to call and make a complaint but no answer. Sent an email and no answer. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this establishment. First impressions are lasting impressions!",

We're currently sitting in our living room nauseated and scared to move for fear of throwing up! To make matters worse we both ordered Sprites to drink,  I'll be damned if they didn't mess that up too!! Both drinks were flat!!! We poured them out after one sip!

I've been here several times before and never had an issue but this particular night was different. After waiting for almost 2 hours, I decided I wanted a refund. They proceed to tell me that they don't do refunds. SO you're telling me that I HAVE to wait when I DON'T want to?? What pissed me off more is you could clearly tell one of the employees knew some of the people waiting. So he would bring out their food so that they wouldn't have to wait. THATS what really bothered my spirits and made me want to leave. Overall Shika the owner was a wonderful person and I definitely appreciated how she de escalated the situation VERY well despite me choosing to not be so nice that night. But it'll probably be a while before I return. Great food and definitely better than any competition in Charlotte. The seafood salad is great too.

    "text": "What terrible service!! This was our first time trying it as we'd been followers on Instagram.  My husband and I were the 2nd party to arrive on Sunday when the restaurant opened.  To start, the doors didn't open right at 11... okay fine.  We took a seat for a few minutes and got seated at the table around 11:15.  We ordered immediately when our 2 friends arrived around 11:20.  I noticed the server taking other tables' orders one after the other rather than going to put orders in in a timely manner.  It was about 15 minutes after she took our order that we saw her leave to go put the order in.  The 4 of us ordered 2 orders of shrimp and grits and 2 orders of chicken and waffles.  For over 45 minutes we waited for our food.  The server kept telling us it was coming.  We finally got our 2 orders of shrimp and grits around 12:15.  No chicken and waffles though... at 12:30 we still didn't have the other half of our order and finally told our server to just cancel it and bring the bill because we had to leave.  So only 2 out of 4 of us ate after being there for over an hour.  We asked to speak to management.  It took 15 mins for the manager to come to our table and it was around 12:45 when she arrived.  She apologized and said she removed the chicken and waffles. Well she should have considering we waited all day and never got it!  But she didn't comp us on the shrimp and grits for the huge inconvenience!   After we complained about it, she said she'd take off a percentage which ended up being $3 off per $18 shrimp and grits order that we wait OVER an hour for... overall what a terrible experience! She should have come to us comping us before we brought it up as a way to make up for the hour and a half that we'd been there with only half our food!  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 just because the shrimp and grits did at least taste good... but it wasn't worth the price or thWe won't be back!",

    "text": "This review is customer service based only. This is not based on the food or quality of food.   Dear Seafood Connection Owners,  After learning of your restaurant and looking at a lot of reviews on Facebook, I decided to give your small business a try. Upon arrival, I noticed the parking lot had remnants of seafood thrown around. Specially, shrimp shells. As my husband and I proceed to enter the building, we were stopped by a gentleman sitting on top of the small brick wall. The gentleman asks us \"do you have a ticket?\"  We respond \"no\" and tell him we are just here to order food. The gentleman then advises that \"the restaurant owners\" are closed down for the night. I check my watch and notice there is still 45 minutes or so. As this conversation takes place, I am also noticing the gentleman is wearing a bulletproof vest.  Yes, a bulletproof vest, so I ask if he is a cop to which he responds \"no, just security\". My husband and I look in puzzlement, as we are thing \" but this is a seafood restaurant\"  what could warrant such protection, so we ask why are he's wearing a vest. The gentleman then explains you never know.  Hmmmm. We thank him and turn around to leave. I write this because it needs to be said. I have no intention of slamming the business to ruins.   WE MUST LEARN HOW TO DO BUSINESS!  One should never conduct their business in such a fashion that the environment is conducive for hostile behavior that ultimately requires military style management. I'm sorry, but no restaurant should have security in a vest. Surely you cannot expect me to eat here, as it is hazardous to my safety.  If this is required, you should rethink how you do the business that you do. This is a restaurant and not a night club. DO BETTER!!!  Furthermore, the cleanliness of your portion of the parking lot must be checked. It's just not a good look for business. I step out of my car to shrimp shells thrown in the parking lot. It's your business, so you cannot use the excuse of we are not responsible for the parking lot because this is a reflection on you. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!    Also, this business of creating an artificial inflation in the demand for your product by constraining business hours, product availability, payments accepted or otherwise will eventually cost you.  IMPROVE THIS!!!  In conclusion, I truly hope you consider what I have written and take measures to improve your business. Remember...small businesses are the heartbeat of America.  If this is your contribution to that heartbeat, one cannot expect anything more than confusion, blight and ultimate failure.    Have a great day.",

    "text": "Got work to do. This is not my first time here. Although, I don't come regular I've came a few times before. I Walked in and they were busy but not as busy as it was when I left l. I ordered  a crab and shrimp plate and a veggie plate. Cashier said about 20/25 min wait. I knew it would probably take longer tho.  After waiting about 25 mins I decided to add a shrimp plate. 10 mins later my shrimp plate came, and waited another 10 or so mins for my original order that was placed 35 mins prior smh but anywho, I check my food and knew immediately that the food was cold. I had to travel 20 mins so I didnt make a big fuss. My other food came and I left. Got to my car and dug into my veggie plate and it was also cold. I was not happy but didn't make a fuss about it either. But never in a million years should anyone be served cold food ESPECIALLY after waiting almost 45 mins! What are y'all doing back there in the kitchen to where people are being served cold food? I just don't get it. Plus I'm not the only one who has made this comment on Yelp. If I'm paying MY money AT ANY establishment whether it be at seafood connection, McDonald's, Firebirds, or Bentleys, I want HOT and FRESH food. I didn't feel like making a big fuss today because I did have about a 20 min ride home but if I were served this sitting down and it was cold I would have pitched a fit and sent it back....Immediately! PLEASE work on this and get it together.  Please recognize the issues and fix them. I know y'all have your ride and dies that will be down with you all no matter what, but not everyone expects mediocre food and service.",

For starters, they are only open on select days and is only advertised by social media. This past Friday they advertised that they would be open 12-8. My husband drives all the way from Fort Mill after work to discover a sign on the door that they are not open although they advertised that they would be. So I cut them some slack and saw that they would be open the next day. They advertised they would be open again this day from 12-8. I drive 25 minutes from the other side of town, arrive at 7:22 to be turned away by their security guard. I was told they don't take orders after 7:30. Not only was it before 7:30 it was before 8 as they advertised! Terrible customer service.",

    "text": "Being a HUGE crab lover, I kept hearing rave reviews about Seafood Connection. I was told that their flavor and seasoning is to die for and this is absolutely True!! Whatever they use to season their seafood is heaven sent and you will not be disappointed. In addition to the flavor of the food, I consistently heard that their customer service was not the greatest. During my visit there on a busy Saturday night, I didn't have any issue with the customer service. My husband's carry out experience on a very slow weekday afternoon was much different. He walked into the restaurant and staff looked at him as he walked in the door but no one bothered to greet him and/or offer to assist him. I would suggest being prepared to wait as the restaurant is often busy in the evenings and especially on the weekend but the flavor of the food makes up for it. I'm hoping the customer service will improve in order to create an outstanding experience all around. I'm certain that, if they're able to change the community's mind about their less than stellar customer service, they will be even MORE amazing!! I'm rooting for them and hope that they stay around for a long time because the food is awesome!!",

In town visiting family and was told we had to try this place because everything looked so good. Unfortunately they have limited hours, being open on weekends only for the most part. This particular week we lucked up and they posted a pop up and opened on Tuesday. Hours said 12-until they ran out for we RAN over there. Let me tell you it was everything I could have imagined and more the food was DELICIOUS! I had the steamed shrimp & crab combo. It was about 10 HUGE shrimp, a crab cluster, 2 pieces of corn on the cob, potatoes and sausage. Everything was smothered in the garlic, herb butter sauce that I believe had fairy dust and unicorn tears in it. It was nothing short of magical! It was an insane amount of food and the price was on par with that. My family got a couple orders of fried shrimp & fries as well which were also delicious. Only thing missing was some cocktail sauce for the shrimp. The pop up day was take out only but it is a pretty large space to dine in. They did say that they will be moving into another space soon so hopefully they'll be able to expand their hours. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Seafood Connection since they had the food truck and at that time the wait times were brutal.  I arrived 10 minutes before they opened to a line of about 10 people already forming.  They opened the doors a little after 11 and only let a few people in at a time to order to eat in or takeout, they do not take calls so you will need to stand in line or come in to place your takeout order so I would advise to view the menu and know what you want in advance, however if you're going for brunch the grilled plates won't be available until after 3pm(at least that's what I was told).  I ordered the shrimp and grits and added crabcakes and a waffle to go, and by noon I was walking out with my order(I also requested light seasoning).  The shrimp and grits included some type of sausage and I would say overall it was amazing after I removed the sausage which didn't enhance the dish at all but took away from it with the weird taste of the sausage.  The grits were not instant but creamy and dreamy the way grits should be and adding the crab cake really sent this dish to over the top deliciousness.  The red velvet waffle with cream cheese was equally great and not average size waffle but a huge Belgian waffle..........have your pillow ready.  On a different day I returned later in the evening and a few things were already sold out....bummer(get there early).  On my third visit I had the grilled fish with sauteed veggies over crab rice, amazing from start to finish.  Everything was very tasty overall, minus the weird sausage, but be very clear there is still a wait, and it's very pricey, so if you're cool with that give them a try.",

I stopped for dinner tonight, 6:45 and given closing was at 7, I ordered takeout. I'll fast forward to the end...my last review urged everyone to check their orders before leaving...well they now instruct you to do so before leaving the building. Now let me back up a little. Today's order was PERFECT...and it confirmed that the last jumbo crab order that I gave the previous review on...I was gypped! Today's order consisted of 4 ears of corn, 2 crab clusters. beautiful potatoes, 1 sausage and 10 jumbo shrimp. The last order consisted of 1 crab cluster, 10 shrimp, a pile of almost mashed potatoes, 2 ears of corn and no sausage (and there are no substitutions). If someone from the restaurant reads these reviews; please know that I love the food...just think that my shorted order needs to be replaced...the next time my mother is in town because it was a Mother's Day dinner. One more thing: please review the takeout process. For extensive time periods, the takeout counter is unattended because the person is running back and forth to the kitchen. There needs to be backup to ensure that the phones are being answered and the carry out patrons are being attended to properly. Thanks for addressing these concerns. I live 7 minutes away and I want this to be one of my regular spots.",

No matter if you dine in or take out Everyone must pay first. No dine and dash here. Didn't take long to receive our food once ordered.   I ordered the shrimp/crableg platter!!! Yesss, the buttery goodness was more than i expected and able to eat. You get crab, shrimp, corn on the cob sausage and red potatoes. I was so full, i had to save the rest for dinner the next day.

The staff is very friendly patient and kind the bathrooms are clean but there is a slight odor.

We drove 1.5 hours as a party of 10 to celebrate a birthday at this restaurant and had a terrible dining experience.  Our table server had to be flagged down to engage in every part of our dining experience-- ordering drinks, getting refills, and asking for condiments. We had to send back a plate of broccoli because it had hair. Our check had 18% automatically added. When I asked to see a manager to have the gratuity reduced to 10%, we were informed that their system automatically adds gratuity. This fact is indeed printed on the menu, but if you've received terrible service (or even exceptional service), gratuity should be adjusted. The manager also attempted to defend the table server three times, and each time I had to restate that I could not be charged for past performance. On a positive note, the food was seasoned well. Still the customer service has discouraged our return.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I will NOT be returning to this place. I previously lived in Maryland and Florida and I have to admit that this is by far THE WORST seafood experience I've EVER experienced! I ordered the special with (1) cluster of crab legs and (8-10)jumbo shrimp steam pot. I got my plate and the presentation was normal however they brought my plate out in a styrofoam to go box versus an actual steam pot. I began eating my food only to find I had wayyyy too much seasoning salt on my food. I suffer from high blood pressure and I just couldn't bring myself to eat this food with this much salt.  The sauce tasted like a butter sauce with tons of lemon pepper in it, I'm a very plain kinda gal when it comes to my crab legs. Just give me a little salt and butter and we have a deal. I ate two crab legs out of the (1) cluster and I honestly couldn't savor the flavor of the sweet crab meat that I had been waiting for, it was more like I was eating a lemon with salt on it. I don't normally like to send my food back but considering the pricing (paying around $100), I kind of had no choice. I had to ask for the manager TWICE, the first time she sent a message through our waitress; I was told, \"because I had already eaten two of the crab legs there was nothing they could do\", even though I showed her the excessive seasoning and huge pinch of seasoning salt observed in one of the corners of my styrofoam plate (as well as all over my food).  Finally I was accompanied by the manager and seemingly she already had her mind made up that she was not going to be able to help me. I explained that I didn't like the seasoning sauce, and her response to me was \"well that's just our signature sauce\". I told her I wasn't warned about the amount of seasoning salt that would be present and she brought up the fact that I had already eaten some of the crab legs, there wasn't anything she could do, luckily my mother convinced her to bring another plate which I consider unnecessary. Because if I am telling her that I cannot eat my food like this, that should've been enough, I was offered another plate without the seasoning and it was a better temperature and no sauce, just butter on the side, OH AND BY THE WAY, THE CHERRY ON TOP WAS SHE DELIBERATELY BROKE OFF TWO CRAB LEGS OFF THE CLUSTER... talk about PETTY. I was okay with the meal but I honestly think I'll go elsewhere for my seafood.  Speaking of bad attitudes, the manager wasn't the only one... the two hostess in the front were very unpleasant. I walked in and spoke to them just to be greeted with a blank stare. Refrain from calling this establishment on the phone because I witnessed the phone continuously ringing; I asked if they had the phones for \"call ahead/reservations\" and the answer was a plain 'NO'. What Is the sense of having a phone and not ever answering it? I was also facing the kitchen and witnessed the staff eating in the back (with gloves on) and all within a few seconds, a staff member was wiping his mouth with the same gloved hand. Another staff member was observed walking out of the kitchen with her shiny, sparkly cell phone case. We all both know that cell phones harbor a lot of germs as well.   I'm highly disappointed in the service, the food and the very few options we had to choose from on their flimsy, dirty menu's that were half ripped and sticky with BBQ sauce from previous customers. And don't even bother doing any kind of substitutions, my steam pot came with corn on the cob, potatoes and pork sausage... I do not eat pork, my only option was to take the pork or not have it at all, ALL FOR THE SAME PRICE! They had no fried oysters either... the list goes on. Take my advice, and save your money. Do not come here. #wastemytimesunday",

Then you get to your table, a waitress comes over and gets the drinks for you. After that, you wait for your food. There was four of us in our party. My husbands food didn't come until after everyone else was FINISHED eating. No one could track down his order. Your waitress doesn't even really know what you ordered. There was no apology made, no offer to get the manager. The only excuse they could give was that there is a fried side and a steamed side of the kitchen. Yet, no one had any fried seafood at our table so it still should've came out at the same time.  The bathrooms were disgusting. Two of the three stalls didn't even have toilet paper. And as you walk your shoes make noise because the floor is sticky.  It's sad to have such great food presented in such a way. And since you pay first, they don't care and it shows. It's clear that they try to keep the overhead sooo low that they are actually losing business. A roll of paper towels on each table, pre packaged plastic silverware, food served in styrofoam and drinks in styrofoam cups sooo basically they don't have to wash or use any real dishes. And you'll never get a drink refill because you will never see your waitress again. They don't even have wet naps but everything is soaked in butter. Ridiculous. They're so focused on getting everyone to pay first but not focused at all on the experience. I'm sure the wait staff doesn't make anything in tips.",

When you walk in, either you go to one side to sit in or the other for take out. Either way, you're ordering and paying for your food right away. Oh and don't forget to mention if you want a drink because I had no idea to do this at the front. It was busy when I came, but I was able to find a seat. They have a dog on the tables that says 1 hour max for eating in customers...The place was hot and it felt like there was no AC, but the music they were playing was all the way up my alley! Our waitress wasn't the friendliest and didn't stop at the table much. The food took around 35-40 minutes to come out, but it was so delicious. I had the connect platter (1 cluster crab legs/2 lobster tails) for $38 and added on shrimp for $10. You get potatoes, two pieces of corn, and about a quarter of a sausage. You will be eating with your hands the whole time (not sure if silverware is even an option), so don't be shy! They have paper towels on the table for you. I won't drive there again unless I'm already in the area (just too far for me being in Greensboro) and although I loved the music, I did not enjoy sweating while eating, nor the service, so in the future I will get take out.",

I had it two times before they moved and was pretty disappointed. Very messy in the bag and the flavors weren't as tasty.   Tried it again at the new location and this was the most disappointing time. We barely had any of the sauce, my food was cold and the portions got smaller. Might've been too big of a step moving into that location because the quality of service went down in my opinion.  Sat there for 30 mins and waited for cold food. Maybe they've just been having bad days when i've been, but I definitely don't see a point in going back.",

They also offer take out, you're still going to have to wait but you can enjoy all the goodness at home.   I ordered the Lock Jaw which comes with shrimp and lobster, potatoes, corn and a sausage. It's a lot food. I appreciate that they cook up all the orders fresh. When my food arrived it was hot and well seasoned. I loved the butter and flavor. Especially on the corn, potatoes and lobster. Yes, it's messy. But isn't that the point?!   Overall, it was a fantastic meal. I'd absolutely come back and try more items on the menu!   Don't let the wait...make you miss this local gem.",

I'm telling you this now, so if you don't like it, just don't go. Butter is good and this food is good. It's obviously not to have everyday.  This was my first visit here and it was a Friday night around 6:30. There was a line and we had to wait outside of the door for a bit before ordering and then getting a table. After being seated there was a wait for the food. Take a good friend and time will fly.   Everyone was friendly: the cashier and the waitress. The waitress came to check on us about 2 times. Everything is in styrofoam containers, which was fine by me because I knew it was clean. The restaurant interior was clean and very large. It does need some updating, but this place is not about ambiance.   I ordered the Lock Jaw: lobster and shrimp which came with potatoes and corn, oh and a tiny sausage. The lobster and corn was my favorite-delicious!!!! The shrimp was just ok for me. I would come back and order carry out next time. Also get more lobster if possible. I probably would not get the shrimp again.   This place is about experience and trying new things. At least try once, I'd only for the lobster...which you must try!",

Now don't get me wrong  you taste the seasoning but only in the butter. Once you suck the crab legs or shrimp that's where it ends. Well do me anyway. The shrimp was very soft(slightly mushy) but the potatoes and corn on the cob was outstanding in taste. The sausage was also soft like it was a breakfast sausage. Also had some hush puppies which were not good at all. I loved the lemonade and sweet tea mix(reversed Arnold Palmer. At least I can say I've been there. Oh wait!!! The Lobster Tail was good",

We sat at our table at 3:15..... our server told us around 4:00 they were still waiting on the lobster . She said she was speaking with the manager about the wait . The manager never physically came to our table . We finally got our food around 4:45... my crab legs were ICE COLD. So we waited for the lobster while the other food sat on the plate ? They offered free seafood salad .. like no , we wanted our food . they took a measly 15 percent off the bill. A manager never came by , and we sat there while multiple tables sat down , ate and left while we waited on some damn lobster . It's too much competition for them to always mess up.

After waiting 30-45 mins you would think the food would be steaming hot. The seasoning is flavorful however very salty. The meal plus tax was around $28.

The photos on Facebook had been taunting me month after month after month with it's perfect looking seafood combos and lines down the street and around the corner.  But waiting in line isn't my style but now that they have this new location which is much larger, we made the trek from Ballantyne and had no problem being seated immediately about an hour and a half after opening. I ordered the shrimp, crab legs, corn, sausage, potatoes, hush puppies and fries and that sauce is just LIFE and makes everything taste delectable. I could pour it on my shoe and eat it!  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the shrimp. Some of them had a really weird taste and were mushy so I won't order that anymore but the crab legs were amazing and surprisingly the sausage! I am not a sausage fan but whatever brand/type they sell is really yummy.  Hubby, who loves corn, passed on it because it was overcooked and he likes his corn really firm and crunchy but that sauce on it is so good, I didn't care. They didn't have mayo for my fries so next time I'll bring my own and our table had to share a crab cracker but it's still not a deal breaker.  I look forward to going back and diving into this deliciousness again.  I think if you get there closer to opening times, there shouldn't be a wait. If need be, I'll update my review after my next visit but I'm sure I'll still love it.  That is all!",

The corn wasn't cooked long enough, sausage was mediocre and the shrimp was over cooked. Oh, totally forgot to mention the potatoes seemed as if someone's grandmother grabbed them out the pot with her hands. Nothing about this place was good and I wasted $95 of my hard earned money here.

You can either get your food to go or sit down. We chose to sit down and sat there for 15 minutes without anyone even coming to get a drink order. After the other tables around us were ordering, I finally said something and 5 minutes later someone finally took our order.   Unfortunately, they were out of a few things. We tried to get seafood salad and eggs, but they were out of both.   We split a C-Port which had shrimp, lobster, and crab legs. The shrimp were huge, but you did have to take the shell off yourself which was pretty annoying. The lobster was probably my favorite part. The crab legs were good, but I always think they're a lot of work for the amount of meat you get. They also don't have anything to crack them with which makes it challenging. The sausage that came with it wasn't that great in comparison. The whole thing is served in a pool of butter and seasoning. It was a lot of food, more than enough to split.   The amount of butter is any keto-eaters be dream. It was delicious and I would definitely go back.",

We waited about 40 minutes, which isn't terrible for a Friday night, but you still should be prepared to wait. I asked our server if it was always this busy, and she said that it has been about every day. The servers and hostesses were all very nice, but because they were so busy, there were a few kinks in the service here and there. The food more than made up for it though.

A third of a sausage, 2 pieces of corn and a half if plate of potatoes,  and not even red russet, regular old potatoes. I was and am still disgusted with the quantity of food that was given. This is not a place I would suggest.",

Came with friends for brunch. Inside had a nice setup and was able to accommodate my party of 11(2 kids). The service was great by Brittany the waiter. The food came out in good time. Great portions for price. I had to really push it to the max to finish everything. Only complaint is usual with shrimp and grits I prefer the tails to be peeled off. Maybe for cooking purposes it is better though. Crab cakes was nice size and had good sauce on top. I will be back to support the black owned business :)",

Once I get seated I notice the table wasn't clean and had to have the waitress wipe it down. Once I got my food it was lukewarm and the shrimp wasn't even deveined .

Went last night with a group and they serve your food in to go boxes and with plastic ware. Asked for real plates with the appetizer and when they arrived they were dirty. When the appetizer of wings arrived they were cold. Server took them back and when they arrived for the second time... surprise cold again. I ordered the steamed shrimp and crab combo that comes with corn, sausage, and potatoes. There was no sausage in my box. I asked the server and she said oh they told me they were out earlier. She could have told us that when they informed us they were out of some of the appetizers as well. The staff is disorganized but there were many of them. Our drinks came in styrofoam cups as well. Server did not offer refills once. Service and food could have been better. I don't think I'll give it another try.",

I took off work early to go there, since I'm not off on the weekends and we expected a wait due to what we've heard. The wait in line to order & pay wasn't bad for us at all. We received our food in a reasonable amount of time, I ordered the shrimp & crab combo and my friend ordered the C port platter. I opened my shrimp and crab combo to find it was missing the crab cluster lol, no worries I just let my server know and they brought out in about 20 mins, which was fine because I understood they were busy. We didn't get our bucket for the shells or bibs, but the food was SO good. They give you a lot, but that sauce is delicious and the food was fresh and hot!! The roll of paper towels on the table really did come in handy. I read a lot of people stating this place is pricey, but seafood, GOOD seafood is never cheap and I'd definitely go back and pay for this again!! The sweet tea was also perfect!!",

Rice was undercooked, it shouldn't be crunchy. Also I think the 1 hr dining limitations are absurd especially when the food isn't all brought out at the same time. Also today a friend I was dining with, they forgot something off her order, instead of just bringing it to her, they asked for her receipt to ensure she paid for it (insert eye roll). I wasn't a fan of the concept either of having to wait in a long line, then having to pay for my food, before I can even sit down. The flavor is there but work on making sure the food is served hot, this place is way too pricey to be served warm food, ensure tickets before they are brought out are properly filled instead of questioning patrons about the validity of an order issue.",

Order and out the door in less than 30mins.    Once home, cracked open the to-go container and the seafood heavens opened up.  First off, non-butter lovers, stay away.  Now that is out of the way, let me just tell you there is nothing not to love about this meal or any meal they offer I imagine.  I had the C-Port platter and nearly ate all of it in one sitting.

Need a better system to serve their customers. It was cold and windy and we were forced to stand outside smh.---",

When we finally got inside, no one apologized or explained it. When asked how I was, I responded cold!! They don't make their own tartar sauce which at a normal restaurant doesn't matter, but at a SEAFOOD place it's little unsettling. The packets of tartar sauce were cute though. When the food came out, it really looked amazing!! I got the fish and shrimp combo. There was more batter than fish but it was kinda like having an extra piece. The fried shrimp, Ff, and hush puppies were good. The servers spent more time talking to each other than the customers. I suspect that they aren't working for tips. We had Brittany and she was actually really good!!  All in all, the food was good but the service was lacking. Fun time had by some.",

    "text": "Done with this place. Gave it 4 tries. First time was when they were on Albemarle...take out only. I had grilled scallops and fish. It was OK....not worthy of all the raving I heard. Maybe because I am from FL and I know of  no BAD seafood restaurants in Jacksonville. Even the ma and Pa restaurants are good. Second visit introduced me the 1.5 hour wait. Granted..this was opening day...so I forgave the long wait...lukewarm food ..and inflated price tag. Meal was not memorable.. can't even remember what we had for 70.00. Third time..called in order for lunch pickup. I should have known to check my order but I had limited time as I was on a 30 min lunch break. I arrived at the time I was told and had to wait 10 min for my order. I was Ok with that. But imagine my dismay when I opened my order to find that instead of the grilled fish and scallops I ordered...fish and shrimp...tiny sliver of fish and about 8 shrimp.  No sauce. ..side of corn.28.00 lunch...oh and my shrimp salad I ordered was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmissing.At&s=1bc4d57fa47f034f865bbd0e90834e303eff21a4c48660ddd7918ee53ccbf8cd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">missing.At</a> this point I was done with SC. But I decided to try one more time...because I believe in supporting Black businesses as much as possible!! We show up at 7pm for dinner The restaurant closing time is 9pm. And guess what? They aren't taking anymore customers. DONE DONE DONE WITH THIS PLACE AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. The food is not that memorable. Check out Harbor View if you looking for a real seafood restaurant.",

The dozens and dozens of recent reviews about the horrible service, long wait times and bad food has officially deterred me from visiting this place. The fact that the owner can respond to some of these reviews with an attitude \"yup I'm that manager you spoke to\" is so unprofessional and makes me not want to even attempt to try this place. Who wants to catch a nasty attitude when trying to get some seafood?? So many reviews consistently say it takes hours to get your food, and the food is consistently cold. Management needs to know their customers matter and it definitely will affect their business profit in the end. I will not be trying this place. Very disappointed",

Steamed super c-port platter, was not necessarily a \"platter\", but more like a quarter half pale. Please before you go, look at the pictures, there's butter on top of butter over more butter, but they do it so well.  At the bottom, they use steamed potatoes as a base, then they throw in the lobster, crab clusters, shrimp, corn, more potatoes and sausages, all steamed.  Then they take A LOT of butter (maybe garlic butter), did I mention that they use a lot of butter, and pour it all over the top of all the other ingredients!!! And there you have it! If you don't mind getting messy, and can handle all that buttered seafood, this is the place to go!!!! It's not a place you can go to every week, but definitely put them in your rotation once a month. They do it right, it won't be the best seafood you've ever had, but what it will be, is SOLID!  You'll definitely get your seafood fix!",

When we first pulled up, there was a looonnnng line out front which turned us away being that it was hot and we were short for time. About 30 minutes later, we see there is no line and decide to try again. We stood in a very short line, finally got to the front to order and it was very strange. You have to order your food first, find a seat and then they bring it to you. I ordered the scallop dinner with veggies and the crab rice. After sitting for about 25 minutes, our food arrives at different times. The crab rice was very salty initially. The scallops were cooked perfectly. After tasting my friends food, we all agreed it was overrated. Everything was salty. Would I come back if I was in Charlotte again? Probably not. For the price and the set up, it was a bit of a turn off.",

I just happen to be on FB and I read SC post requesting everyone give them the opportunity to make things right by inboxing them opposed to leaving bad reviews on Yelp.  I simply commented and advised them that system doesn't work because I inboxed SC back in August and yet to receive a response.  The person requested that I inboxed them while she was online so I just went to the original message and sent them another one.  I only wanted to offer feedback on my order being wrong and I was missing an item which was an egg.  I ordered crab legs but received lobster and I included the receipts (not itemized) with pictures.  Keep in mind it's has almost been a year ago and I've been to SC plenty of times after receiving the wrong order.  The person from SC was extremely rude and asked me if I had a receipt I advised her to look at the message because it was included keep in mind this happened August 2018 unfortunately I don't keep greasy receipts for 8 months. She then examined the pictures and told me it was a shrimp plate. I got 2 orders look at the other  picture. She then offered me 1 crab cluster and 2 bucks for my missing egg.  I told her my egg was actually 3 bucks She then wanted to argue with me back and forth about a price.  I didn't want anything from them just providing feedback and she was extremely rude and defensive. I will NEVER step foot in that establishment again or refer them to anyone. Whoever is responding on behalf of SC definitely need to go to a professional to get training on customer services in the hospitality business.  I still can't believe it.",

I had the fried shrimp and fish platter and it was sooooo good I didn't even need Ketchup or any sauce. I also order the steam shrimp. They are very large and flavorful. Lastly I ordered the super combo with two clusters of crad legs and shrimp plus it came with corn, potatoes,and sausage  if you are second guessing this place give the a try.

We couldn't order anything fried die yo their fryer being closed at 6:30 when the sign at the register said 8:30. I see this restaurant all over social media and people seem to really love it however being a responsible for a large business myself it's clear how much structure this place lacks including a lack of employees that care about the inconvenience of the hours being incorrect.

Living in Charlotte, I've never tried it but today I decided I would.....and they failed to meet my expectations! First off, I had more potatoes than food. If I'm paying that much, I want more of the entree instead of the sides. The food was so overpriced (one bunch of crab legs )! I don't mind paying for food, but it needs to be GOOD FOOD. Nothing tasted seasoned....the seasoning came from the \"butter sauce\" they use but once you peel the shell or casing away, you're left with food not seasoned or flavored. The shrimp and lobster were over cooked, you could tell by how rubbery they tasted. And the final nail in the coffin...my crab legs were ice cold! I live less than 10 minutes away and when I got home, I had to heat them up. I'm all for supporting small businesses, but this won't be a place I'll be back to visit or patron or even recommend.",

Once I arrived however, it all went downhill quickly! The first thing I noticed was the parking lot was very poorly light. In fact there where parts of the parking lot that were pitch black.  Once I carefully parked my car I headed inside. As I entered the restaurant a guy asked if I was there to eat, and I thought he was joking because he had a chuckle in his voice as he asked me the question.  I advised that I was in fact there to eat and he laughed and said they were closed.  There were people all over the place, and I was confused, and I asked if he was pulling my leg or something, and got the same response \"we are closed\" followed by a laugh.  I then turned to the hostess and she said the same and laughed as well.    After having the same reaction again, she finally told me that there wait time was holding at 2 1/2 hours.  Now, why they couldn't have told me that to start with, is beyond me!  I understand having such a long wait time and making the decision to close, but not giving the reason as people arrive is beyond me. Not to mention that it is a terrible example of customer service.    I will NOT be back no matter how good the food is.  Terrible customer service tops possible fantastic food any day!",

I sent them back and then they came out in 5 mins minutes but the batter was falling off the shrimp. I probably wont going back the manager took 15% off bill but I wish I had sent it all back and just left. It is what it is but i was not impressed. I wasted $60 on food. I would of much rather went to Bonefish and go a dine in reward credit opposed to wasting money there.",

After eating the food, I don't understand all the good reviews for this place. I am a seafood lover and basically eat all types of food. I am not a picky eater or a person that complains or write negative reviews, but I guess there's a first for everything.   My boyfriend and I ordered the Super Combos Platter, which is shrimp and crab legs with corn, potatoes and sausage and the Fried Oysters. We asked if they have bread. The server said no. So then we asked if there was anything that they served that can sopped up the butter or sauce from our entree. She then suggested maybe some hush puppies. We said ok.   We were served the hush puppies first. They were dry. The Fried Oysters were okay. Would have been better if they served it with a creamy side sauce. Then our entree came. It was drowned in a thick, SALTY (saltier than the Dead Sea) margarine sauce. It wasn't even butter. The outrage for a seafood restaurant to use margarine! There was one piece of sausage, which could have been cut into 2 pieces. Also, the potatoes were Idaho potatoes that looked like they were hand broken in half instead of cut with a knife. It just looked like strange odd shaped chunks of potatoes.  The service was OKAY. Server was nice, but not efficient. She didn't give us a crab cracker until my boyfriend asked for crab crackers - she came back with ONE crab cracker. What am I - chopped liver? Smh.  If you're a True seafood lover, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you like fake butter and extremely salty food, then maybe try this place.",

We waited for about 1 hour and 30 minutes before being seated. The young lady who took our drink orders was very kind and professional but you could tell she was overwhelmed. The young man who took out food orders was all over the place! We ordered an appetizer that never came! We asked him about it, he disappeared and never returned. The young lady had to bring our food out by herself! I felt so bad but she handled everything well.  The food was outstanding! I ordered the super combo for $35 & it is worth every penny due to the amount of food you receive. Arrived at the restaurant at 12:15pm and did not leave until 3:30pm...again if the service was better I would highly recommend.",

I live in New Jersey, while In Highpoint, NC for a couple of days We had to take that 1 hour drive and wait 30 minutes to try the seafood.  The food was AMAZING and I didn't even finish all my food, I love the fact that your food come in containers already so just in case you don't finish it makes it easier to take with you. Our waiter was amazing, the only thing we didn't like was that our food came before our appetizer. So by the time it came we just took it to go . Other then that next time we are in NC we will be back. If this post gets read please make a seafood connection in New Jersey. I would invest in this business as I can see it doing very well in any state it's located in.",

This is by far, the worst place I have eaten at in Charlotte. The dining experience started off unpleasantly when we were seated by the hostess. She made you feel as though you were troubling her just by walking in. The waiter couldn't be less attentive and our meal could not have possibly been the same meal others rave about here on Yelp. The food was far from \"fresh and delicious,\" and I supposed the \"secret spice\" they are speaking about is margarine, salt and pepper. If this is Charlotte's best seafood restaurant, don't ever have seafood in Charlotte!  The super combo steamed plate was composed of dissolved, mushy shrimp, crab legs, sausage and potatoes. I could think of better ways to spend $35 than on this over cooked plate of slime. The crab rice? Save your $10 since there is maybe a morsel of crab at best in there! I couldn't even stomach the taste. The $12 fried oysters were over fried in their batter and the oysters themselves seemed rotten.   What a disappointment! Thank goodness we tried it out first before bringing guests. Don't be fooled, save your money!",

My husband got the steamed lobster tail and crab legs and raved about his. The service was great! It is a no-frills, good food kinda spot and I'm with it. There were only two things that would've made it better for me. I found the seasoning on the potatoes to be a bit too salty (my husband says that he thought it was perfect) and we all agreed that the crab was kinda hard to get out of the shell because it was slightly overcooked. We didn't get the perfect pieces of crab popping out but more of the shredded crab consistency.  That being said, overall - it's worth the hype and a good local spot.",

The food was excellent and very well portioned. Kids meals were also decent. Would recommend getting the Super Combo of Shrimp & Crab Clusters which was more than plenty to share with kids & adults. Other adults got small  plates off the menu, Salmon & fried shrimp with no complaints. The butter sauce (unique & tasty) on the Super Combo was saturated over the entire dish, would probably get it on the side next time.

While we didn't request it, they were nice to bring us new crab legs. I wish they would have refunded us and called it the day. I didn't want anymore food and/or it being wasted.   I did slip on the greasy floor and caught myself but that might be something to consider fixing. Yes, plastic warning signs that floor is wet were posted, but it doesn't deter the fact that the greasy floor needs to be cleaned.",

    "text": "Wow!!! If you want fresh and delicious seafood, then you need to take a trip to this restaurant.  On my first visit I had a difficult time choosing from the many options.  I settled on the Steamed Shrimp and Crab Leg platter. It was served on a bed of potatoes with sausage and a side of corn on the cob dripping in a lemon, butter and herb sauce.  It was delicious!! My friend ordered the fried fish and shrimp platter!  Before she could take a bite I had one of her shrimp in my mouth. Delicious!!  Well seasoned and fresh!    Although the restaurant is more like cafeteria styled dining with your food served in to-go containers, very basic tables and chairs, the theme and the restaurants name was beautifully sprawled across the table tops and walls!  As for your food being served in to-go containers, a very wise move on the owners part.  The amount of food you receive cannot be eaten in one sitting.  Making the to-go container a necessity!      This restaurant is definitely on the top of my list and will be a regular stop for seafood!!       Unfortunately, I couldn't add a pic of my meal.  Not sure why!",

Will NEVER go back to this place. The food was not what it was hyped up to be. We did not enjoy it",

Took 30 minutes to get seated we arrived at 12:15 pm got seated about 12:45. Took the waitress 20 minutes to approach our table. We saw several wait staff standing around talking, bobbing to the music and singing. So we couldn't understand where was the team work at if they saw our waitress  haven't even took our drink orders yet, help your coworkers out!!! We all ordered something simple since we already been there for over an hour. Ordered the shrimp and grits about 6 of us and the other 2 ordered fried fish plates. Simple, we thought at 2:15pm, we still had not received our food, couple of the guest asked for lemons for their water or tea, took her 30 minutes to bring lemons. We just ended up leaving offered to pay for our drinks the manager on duty who was so busy talking to some folks she must have known for years ignored my husband standing there for 10 minutes needing to speak to her so he heard the whole conversation which involved friend chat. She didn't turn around until I said out loud we want to pay for our drinks and leave please. 2:30 pm we leaving with no food and had to walk over to Cheddar's right next door to get some real service got there at 2:35 and the whole party ate and out the restaurant full by 4:00... priceless and the reason I be so skeptical about supporting black owned business!!!!!! the service always sucks!!!!!!!",

This was my first time here and I just ordered something simple thinking it wouldn't be a long wait but boy was I wrong. All I got was a fried fish platter with fries and it was still an hour from the time I walked in the door till when I walked out with my food. I was pissed about the wait but the food was good. I would go back again but I'm not waiting in that long ass line when I know other seafood places where the food is just as good and a little bit cheaper plus they offer better options like turkey sausage. This is not a knock on them but I'm just comparing.",

It was close to opening time so we were seated immediately. Our server, Desmond, was extremely warm and welcoming. I ordered the lobster tail and crab cluster combo. It didn't take long at all to get to our table. It came with a boatload of potatoes, 1 piece of sausage (which I was a bit bummed about), and two pieces of corn on the cob. The lobster tail was a great size! About 8oz, which is hard to come by when dining out. I will say, prepare to get messy!! All of the food was very well seasoned, and the dipping butter is actually on the bottom of the pail so it touches all of your food. I liked it that way, but if you're not into all of the buttery goodness, I'd ask for it on the side. Unfortunately, they did not have gloves, but we were provided with lemon scented wipes so it wasn't too bad. The wifi went out so the system went down for about 10 minutes while we were preparing to pay, but Desmond was SOOOO  pleasant, we barely noticed. Thanks for great service Desmond! And hats off to the chefs!",

I don't know if it's a lack of staff, or staff experience, but there's no reason that we should've spent over 2 hrs in the way we did. We were told the wait to be seated would be over an hour but were seated within maybe 10-15 mins. The wait times between when our order was taken, when our food arrived, and when our check was taken was the bulk of our time. I didn't sense a collective sense of urgency.  I'm not sure how they have the front of the house managed, but there should always be toilet paper in the restrooms. Thankfully I have the habit of checking before I go and was able to get paper towels beforehand.   I hope that the service kinks will be worked out in the near future because I think the food is definitely worth a try but I can't justify such a lengthy experience. ESPECIALLY when you have people traveling from out of town just to see what you're all about. Once the service matches the hype--they'll be golden.",

You can take it to go or stay and eat. They also have a bar for drinks if your sitting. I ordered the Super C-Port platter (fried), Crab Rice, Seafood Mac n Cheese & Season Fries. When I got home the food was still hot and you can smell the freshness of the seafood. The C-Platter had 2 Lobster tails, 8-10 Fried shrimp, 2 pieces of corn, potatoes, sausage (pork) & hush puppies. There was enough food for my wife and I to share, we both were stuffed when we were done. The food was absolutely amazing! Great place to eat REAL Seafood in Charlotte. A must go to!!!!!",

There was a slight stale smell in the room/building. It took me about one hour, from standing in line to actually receiving the food I ordered.   I ordered the steamed shrimp and crab combo, along with the fried shrimp and fish combo. The fried combo was seasoned well, warm, and edible, yet the fries were soggy. The overall combo wasn't worth the $17 price attached to it.   The steamed combo was the most disappointing. The food was drenched in a buttery, salty seasoning sauce. It completely overwhelmed the combo and my tastebuds. The shrimp were NOT deveined and had a strong odor. I was unable to enjoy the corn and potatoes because of all the sauce it was drowned in. The meat in the crab legs were good. Maybe if the shrimp were deveined and the sauce was placed on the side in a plastic ramekin versus all over the food, this could have been a decent meal.   Overall, my experience was not worth my time or the $45 I spent. This could have been an off day; but for the price, time, and environment I'm not willing to give it another chance.

When you Walk in they give you the option to be seated or to order at the bar. We heard before that the place is usually packed and they were not lying. The place was definitely jumping and we opted for carry out service instead of waiting an hour to be seated. We waited in line and looked at the menu. Everything sounded pretty good and looked to be reasonably priced like I said before. I ordered the \"super combo\" steamed and hubby ordered \"the connect\" with extra shrimp, steamed. When we finally got home and opened the boxes the food was busting out of them which is a good thing. Everything was covered in butter and I know a lot of people may not like that but we certainly did. Everything was seasoned superbly and we both were very satisfied with the portions. Neither one of us finished our whole plate and we will surely be having them for leftovers tomorrow. Overall from what I could see from the inside, the place was nice and clean and the customer service was good. Once we got home and started eating, the food was excellent we will definitely be returning soon although our food ended up being $80 for two meals LOL. All jokes but, seriously the food was definitely worth the $80.",

Yes really even the corn on the Cobb was worthy enough for this review. My husband and I came in on a busy Sunday afternoon, gave our names and was seated within 15-20 minutes. I have been trying to make it here for many moons so I wasn't mad at a 20 minute wait. We dived right into ordering our food as we already knew what we wanted.   Disappointed they were all out of scallops and lobster tails, I ordered fried flounder and shrimp with a side of corn on the Cobb, crab fried rice and an amazingly large $10 crab fill up box ( that my husband and I shared). My husband ordered grilled shrimp and salmon that came with crab fried rice. Every single thing was phenomenal. I can see how someone may have mixed reviews based on the heavy butter sauce but if your not a heavy sauce person I would opt for no sauce or sauce on the side. Thank you Seafood Connection for catering to my seafood needs your food is amazing!! I'll be back for sure.",

Only one thing was missing....they ran out of andouille sausage! That is a much needed and required part of any seafood boil. I had to ask for a substitute item since my waitress did not offer an explanation. After 10 minutes of asking around, I received 2 extra pieces of corn. 2nd item was the fried shrimp and fish. Our waitress didn't know what kind of fish and we did not want fish surprise the response was it was Whiting. It was under cooked as my sister prefers well cooked fish or cooked hard. Shrimp were just ok and the fries needed more seasoning and color. It was a 45 minute wait to be seated so our orders were changed to to go. They did not provide any ketchup for the fries and were skimpy with the tartar sauce also missing cutlery and napkins. A lackluster and dissatisfying trip.",

    "text": "Something in the sauce is Margarine...  I have stood in line for up to 6 hours when there was a food truck. I was literally one of the first customers. Now, I won't be going back unless someone else pays or come in town. The niche that was held has now expanded.  I ordered the C-Port and Lockjaw. I also got seafood salad, extra egg, sausage, corn amd shrimp and a fried fish plater...  None of the food came together. The fish was the last to come out. Understandably, as it was piping hot with steam. However, it was lightly fried with absolutely no seasoning. The person that ordered the fish tries to figure out why it would not be cooked/fried hard. It could have been because of the piping hot fish  caused condensation on the styrofoam box cause it to get soggy but I'm not sure. I had to ask for the extras that was ordered and the Lackjaw had absolutely no potato or should I say mushed mashed potatoes.   The sauce uses to be amazing. It was green and had the out of world flavor. Now, I can tell corners have been cut and the herbs are dried; taste lile Mrs. Dash...  The kids are joking in the restaurant, no professionalism and there's attitudes when you go to get ab to-go-order. I was so proud of Jamie for acquiring both his locations early and really pushing seafood but I feel that he's fallen off. I'm just really disappointed in the sauce. It was truly what set him apart from the competition.",

    "text": "So i first had seafood connection when they were just a food truck. The food was so good, but required standing out in the heat for at least an hour. Once they moved to albemarle road, the wait time decreased some, but the atmosphere wasn't the best.   The other day I visited their current restaurant location in university and it was nice and well-kept inside. The current restaurant is a major upgrade and they were playing some great tunes. Definite great vibes inside. My sisters and I called ahead and were told our food would be ready in 20 mins. We got there about 35 mins later and our food was ready at the bar. I had the lock jaw with a lobster tail and shrimp. One of my sister's had the same, the other the crab plate. We also got an order of crab rice which is amazing. The food was good, not as good as the first time I had it, but that could definitely have been because it was no longer hot by the time we got home. I love the butter sauce, but my only request is for them to make sure there isn't a pool of it in my bag. Luckily, the cashier/bartender was super pleasant, saw our dilemma and immediately offered to give us a new bag. Customer service was good by this bartender/cashier. Wish I had gotten her name!",

    "text": "I have been looking for a great seafood place since I left Florida in January and moved to North Carolina and sadly this place disappointed me.   They had an amazing picture today of a tray of freshly made crawfish. So I decided to go in and order the crawfish. For 6.00 you get a pint so I ordered 2 pints. Then I added on 2.00 eggs, 2.00 potatoes and 2.00 corn on the cob. I asked for butter only to be told they had a special seasoned butter that they make there which was s tiny container of congealed butter that was over salted.   So 26.00 later I am at home and open my container of crawfish that you could tell was sadly microwaved and over cooked to the point they were rubbery. The only saving grace were the sides I ordered as they were good.  I ended up throwing most of the crawfish away due to the rubbery texture was horrible.   I wont be back.... but it was an experience and my hunt continues for seafood in Charlotte",

    "text": "This is definitely a place for sharing; If you can eat an entire serving of their standard \"plates\" at once then kudos to you sir or ma'am. Otherwise, you'll have more than enough for lunch and dinner for about two days.  Seafood Connection is located right off WT Harris right next door to Cheddar's. They have their own large parking lot. When I visited early on a Saturday, I was able to walk right to the bar to place my to-go order. Apparently, I picked a good time to go because the restaurant was pretty empty (this was just before noon on a Saturday, FYI), unlike how it gets later in the day.  I placed my order for a grilled shrimp plate that comes with crab rice and peppers & onions. The total was $21.65 (after tax). I waited no more than 10 minutes and my order was ready. They have a sign hanging up behind the register that urges you to check your order before you leave because there will be no refunds once you leave the premises.  Once I got home, I dug in and I have to say, I was not that impressed. Their famous seasoning was good but not great. I did appreciate that the shrimp were large and plentiful but I didn't like that they keep the shrimp shells on -- I know, I know the shells have all of the flavor but I could do without.  I think I should've gone with one of the platters that have a combo of seafood but I'll give one of those a whirl on my next visit.  Seafood lovers, this is definitely the place for you.",

The staff is thoroughly unprofessional. They have a residential phone line in this business with no call waiting, so the phone will ring endlessly with no chance of getting someone to pick up if they are using it. Sometimes they just aren't answering the phone and you can walk into the restaurant and catch the person taking phone orders off task.   I'm shocked that they are opening another location in South Carolina with their profits instead of investing in fixing the Charlotte location first.",

The amount of food you receive for the price is on point . You will definitely have a doggy bag or a second meal .

So as we're sitting at our table where the seats are full with other paying customer this young lady yells out what she take my picture for and why they keep looking at me,  so I said cause you keep playing in your hair and serving people their food. So now the manager comes out and didn't ask what the problem was. She comes to the table and say \"do I need to escort y'all out\". We're confused cause why are you wanting to escort us out when we haven't done anything. Then she proceed to say that the waitress said we threatened her, really.  By this time I'm fired up cause 1st off for you to approach us without knowing the situation then you want to handle us like children. So I ask for their corporate office number then the manager states she's corporate... Really!!!!  They didn't know if we were mystery shopper or what, needless to say we left and will not return and will be searching hard to see who owns this place and give my reviews...  This place need to hire people who loves what they do not just working for a pay check",

The wings and shrimp, fish and oyster plate were good and the crab legs. But they're shrimp was literally disintegrating when we peeled the shrimp, and mushy. There were also black spots on the shrimp meaning they are old. They were nice about it and brought another plate of shrimp and it was the same issue. Then they gave us 2 to go boxes of crabs, and only charged us for the crabs and not the shrimp, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it would be 2.",

I ordered the jerk wings in which I returned because they were very salty, so much so that I just could not eat them, i ate one bite though and just about spit it out. I also ordered the crab leg, shrimp and lobster steamed platter and unfortunately the seafood was over cooked and oversaturated with seasonings that I could not taste the seafood at all! After waiting 45 minutes for my order to arrive, I was hungry and ate the over cooked-salt lobster (maybe they should rename it this). I was charged ofcourse for the salt lobster and left dissapointed with a tab. I just didn't have another 45 minutes to wait for them to correct it. My server was nice however and the vibe of the restaurant was live. I would not recommend this place if you're a True seafood lover like myself. I guess to each their own though.",

It's been almost an hour since I ordered so why not start on the review...I have nothing else to do.  I'm not sure why things are taking FOREVER and I've seen people who ordered after I did get their food and leave. Hmmmmm, I wonder what they ordered.  As others have stated, it's cash only. And did I mention, it's taking FOREVER to get my food? I'm praying it's knocking my socks off, and blowing up my skirt good because it's honestly the only way I'll drive all the way back over here again, EVER!  The woman at the register is very nice.  I'm done for now until my food comes out. I ordered my food at 7pm, it is now 7:59...received food at 8:18.  PLOT TWIST...  The food is amazing! It's almost 10:00 and I'm just able to get to it because I went to the gym to earn the meal!  Everything is seasoned extremely well. The usual drawn butter one would need for crab legs has no place with this food, it really is THAT GOOD! And when I opened the containers, there was a little extra for my wait...I'M NOT MAD!  So although I walked out thinking that I'll probably never return, I have had a change of heart. I'm hoping my situation was a one time thing and the next time I'll be happy with my total experience.",

The only thing is that you will probably have to wait a while. The line can get long so get there early. There is a bar but it was not open when we were there.

My Neice food was cold as well and the shrimps was nasty and too soft. Ughh what a bad day at seafood Connection.  The waiter was so pleasant and understanding that I couldn't even get so upset. Cashae gave us the check and wrote on the the check apologizing for the inconvenience which I thought was so nice. Cashae customer service was on point and she was very professional at all times, which put a smile on my face leaving seafood Connection but I will not be going back to eat there as far as Cashae you have a beautiful smile and made things better when I left there. They should be happy to have you as a waiter!!!!",

We were travelling and it was almost seven, so we decided to order there.  Big mistake.  They were out of half the menu.  We settled on just fish and shrimp plates.  The wait was not long, but when we got our order there was no ketchup for the fries, no tarter for the fish, no sauce for the shrimp.  We asked and were told they had only tarter sauce.  They gave us three generic foil packs of sauce for over $50 of fried fish!  When we got back to our hotel we discovered they gave us no plasticware to eat with.  So here I sit, eating undercooked rice with my fingers in my room.  The only thing well cooked were my scallops, but they were gritty as though they were not washed properly.",

Explain to me why a restaurant would run out of food, I guess they don't measure they're portions well. I haven't tried they're food yet, because they only open certain days. The times that I've stopped by they're out of food. Lol good luck people !",

Known for long wait lines, it's the kind of place where you have to make a conscious decision that the food is worth the wait before you even venture in their direction.  That's what I did today...I decided the food was worth the wait and waited an hour to place a to go order only to be told I couldn't order from the regular menu because it was \"customer appreciation week\".    It would have been great to know that before I went there at best, but at minimum, make it clear before people wait in line for an hour.  Going to this place is like opening a box of cracker jacks- you never know what you're gonna find.   But here is what is always clear- they simply DONT appreciate their customers, even during customer appreciation week.  And their employees aren't empowered to do anything but say \"I don't make the rules\" while the managers hide in the back and won't come out and address concerns. Good luck with your experience.  I'm done giving them another chance to drop the ball.",

They put our names down and gave us an estimate of a 45-1 hr wait and told us we will receive a text to inform us when our table was available. We never received a text and the wait turned to an almost 2 hr wait with 2 small hungry children. When we went in to check on the status, the manager who put our name on the list made an error in entering it into the system. We explained to them how this was such an inconvenience to us  with the 2 small hungry and now irritable children and as a complimentary (in which we had to ask for) they offered to give us hush puppies and no charge of the $2 adult drinks and said that they hope the food will make up for their mistake. As a result we left due to the waiter telling us our food would not be ready until after the to-go orders were done, in which he said would've been another 45 to an hour wait.That is poor customer service and very inconsiderate to not think of the children. WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!!!",

    "text": "Poseidon smiles upon the hands that bless us with the aquatic cuisine at Seafood Connection. It lives up to the hype. On a Friday afternoon, around 4:30, I waited an hour and a half before ordering, followed by 10 minutes for the food to come out. Despite the time, it was love at first bite. This is great seafood. So good, I returned 5 days later for another round. The second visit, a Wednesday at 2:15, there was practically no wait. I was in and out in 15 minutes.  The food is seasoned to perfection with lots of butter. This is Not healthy seafood, so pack your cholesterol meds. Food is served in a takeout box, whether you choose to eat in or not. At first blush, the price point is on the high side, but compared to other sit down restaurants, your Red Lobsters and such, it's right on par. You're just getting better quality and tasting seafood here.  On my most recent visit I had the Super C-Port platter. It included 2 crab clusters, 4 - 1/2 lobster tails, 16 jumbo shrimp, 4 pieces of sausage, 2 pieces of corn on the cob, and what amounts to 2 whole potatoes. Enough to feed 3.   They should do a better job of stating how much of everything you're getting with each meal (i.e. \"2 clusters\" .... \"16 shrimp\"). The menu leaves lots of questions. As far as service, they're friendly enough. No one is bringing food to your table, so there's not much to judge by.  Some things to note: Cash only. Open randomly in no discernible pattern - check the IG or FB page for open dates, which are posted night before or morning of. Located inside of King of Spicy restaurant.  Thank me later.",

I don't believe an hour and 20 minute wait time for my order to arrive at the table is acceptable at any restaurant.  When I asked about my order (at 40 minutes post-order, and 1 hour post-order), no one could give me any explanation as to why there was such a delay for 10 shrimp and a cluster of crab.  I would like to come back, but I will be more persistent with staff to get my order in a more timely manner.  Recap: Great taste, nice staff, very long wait for food.",

    "text": "This is far and away one of the the best, most unique seafood set-ups I've ever seen or tasted.  If you haven't been or heard about Seafood Connection yet, lucky-for-you I went here, and am perfectly stuffed to give you everything you need to know from the Seafood to the Connection...  Parking:  Parking shouldn't be an issue, as Seafood Connection (SC) is actually housed in the same restaurant as King of Spice (I know it's weird), which is in a nice size shopping plaza off of Albemarle road.    Follow:  In order to figure out exactly whats going on, when there're open and what the menu offerings are, you've got to follow their Instagram page - seafoodconnectioncharlotte  Set-up/Ambiance:  DO NOT GO HERE EXPECTING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A WAITER COME TAKE YOUR ORDER.  This is not that kind of establishment. The best way to describe this place is to imagine the Soup-Nazis episode from Seinfeld, but for seafood.  For example, after checking their IG page and seeing they were opening at 2pm, I made sure to arrive at 12:40.  Yes, thats right, a 1hr and 20min before they actually started taking orders.  Trust me, thats the only way to go.  Upon arriving, you walk around to the bar area where they have plenty of seats, post-up, maybe grab a beer and watch the line grow until they start taking orders around 2pm.  Oh and once its ordering time, know exactly what you want, and have your CASH IN HAND.  That's right, cash only!!!!!  There's also an ATM located in the front lobby of King of Spice.     Food:  I mean its seafood, and some of the best seafood you are gonna find in and around the Charlotte area.  I got the C-port plater (crab legs, shrimp, and lobster tails - all steamed), with a side of fries.  Total cost - $43.30.  Certainly not cheap by any means, but of course you have to pay for fresh, quality, seafood, especially here in Charlotte, NC.  In addition to the crab-legs, shrimp and lobster, the C-port plater comes with 2 small ears of corn, a big, meaty, smoked sausage (thats what SHE said, hehe), and one whole white potato, all drenched in some secret, butter, seafood sauce!!!  So you are are definitely getting a bunch of food.  I really can't complain about any of the food items.  Everything tasted awesome!!!  Everything is made to order, therefore it takes a good 10-15min before your food comes out.  Service:  No complaints as far as the service is concerned.  There's really not a whole lot for the servers to do except take your order, and bring you a styrofoam tray bursting with fresh seafood.  If you like seafood, you are gonna LOVE Seafood Connection.  Just remember to bring plenty of cash and look for King of Spice (once again Seafood Connection is located at the bar of King of Spice, don't say I didn't try to tell you!)  My only regret, is that I am just now discovering Seafood Connection, I'll be back soon and I'll be doing unmentionable things to some seafood!!",

    "text": "So this place is currently sharing a kitchen with the King of Spice restaurant (look for their sign when trying to find the place). I didn't understand the hype before today because my friend woke me up on a Saturday morning (grrr) to tell me that we should be ready to go once she got the notification. Again, I didn't understand the exclusivity but I figured \"oh, what the hell\" and gathered my life to get out the bed! Let me tell you... I'm not even mad! Lol   The hour of operations varies and they also operate on different days of the week because the kitchen space is shared. For the most up to date information, refer to their IG page (@seafoodconnectioncharlotte). The IG will also provide an update on what items aren't available from their menu for that particular day.   IF THE LINE IS LONG...STAY THERE! Seriously, it moves faster than any place I've been where the food is made to order! I will not disclose how long we waited because it varies day to day and I don't want to discourage anyone's tummy (but prepare to be patient for at least 1.5 hours). Also, they operate as CASH ONLY (no exceptions). If you forget cash then there is an ATM available... but save yourself the headache and just bring cash before you arrive. Also, the prices aren't budget friendly so check out the menu before you offer to pick up plates for others! BUT IT'S WORTH IT (my pregnant friend gave it the motherly stamp of approval since she still had food left over).   The customer service is wonderful and even though the people behind you will want you to rush, the cashier will be friendly and helpful (in no way am I condoning that you take your sweet time though, lol).   All in all.... I will be back there!! Maybe sooner than later!",

Ordered a seafood dish that was full of butter. several other people at the table ordered the same dish everyone's dish had a different level of butter. mine had at least a stick of butter. I sent it back and asked for them to remake it with the butter on the side as I had asked when I first made my order with the waitress.  The waitress told me they didn't do that the dish came as it was. so I asked for the manager. well the chef came out and his response was you don't ask  McDonald's to not put salt on the fries do you? I replied to him yes I do but more importantly  this Resturant is not supposed to be  the same caliber of restaurant of McDonald's  as it is not supposed to be fast food.  however I have requested no salt and McDonald's , Chick-fil-A and Burger King all of which  have obliged with no problem only saying you might have a few minutes wait as they drop a new order fries. needless to say the chef said he would do it this time only with a very nasty attitude. They brought the dish out with the butter sauce on the side and the waitress slammed the plate on the table saying you can't keep both. You have to give the others back (like I wanted it). The manager never came to the table. Could not eat the food. I did not feel comfortable.  Also be careful if you go. The floor is extremely slippery. They must have used the wrong wax. My friend and other people in the Resturant slipped and almost fell",

When they called our party we carefully walked across the grease filled floor hoping we didn't slip and fall. After being seated we were served our drinks & we placed our food orders. For 1.5hrs we patiently waited for our food. Several times we asked the status of our order. We saw people come in after us complete their meal and leave. Yet, there was no explanation for the super long delay for our food. Hungry and frustrated, we were eventually forced to cancel our order. It took another 20 minutes to do that. Appalled by the entire experience, we asked to speak with the manager. Of course, she never came. To say the least the wait times and customer service at this place SUCKS!!!! Worst restaurant experience I've ever encountered.",

    "text": "The Seafood Connection was a terrible idea! First Your greeted at the door by two gentlemen that don't have a clue about customer service in a restaurant. Not sure why one of them felt the need to carry a gun partly exposed in his pocket; the other one boasting about having access to another if needed? \"I just wanted to try the food for the first time... it felt like I was going into a club in a rough part of the city. They may as well have frisked me before entering. They make you stand in a line outside for at least 20 minutes before you can enter to sit down. My brother and I decided to forgo the dining experience and get the meal to go. The wait was even longer.  Now once inside, I can see the restaurant is half empty, lots of empty tables. The wait is because they are severely under staffed. Service is extremely slow. So we placed our order to go; I ended paying $17 for a $12 meal. I ordered the shrimp and flounder without hush puppies and extra fries; what I got was shrimp with fries and hush puppies. \" I should have checked my order before leaving\". Live too far and waited too long for the order. Tried to call the number on the receipt and of course their phone is not in service . My first intentions was I to go to Showmars. This was a horrible experience and a waste of time.   Based on my business knowledge and professional opinion; the Owner/Manager was not ready to open. Piss poor planning! I predict this restaurant will be closed in 6 months!!!",

The line shorted for me once someone inside asked for takeout orders.  Inside was dim with sky lights used for lighting during lunch hours.  Gray walls and hip hop/r&b music playing.  Takeout orders were taken at the bar.  I knew what I wanted but waited for people ahead of me to decide.  Bad mistake because the wait was long enough.  I usually pay enough when I first try a new place but I wanted to be smart and not overdo it because it was a pricey spot.  Glad I did because I didn't care for my meal.  I got the boiled shrimp platter that came with potatoes and sausage with butter drenched over everything.  The potato was pretty much sliced open with shrimp on top, once piece of sausage, and two pieces of corn and little to no salted butter with parsley poured over it.  The corn was off the chain.  The shrimp didn't taste like the ocean or smell like it.  I only tasted one spot were salt was dashed.  I think I paid $17 and tax.  That's all I needed to pay.",

When we opened the bag at home, only half the order was present. We returned to the restaurant immediately to fulfill the remainder of the order, but the kitchen had closed.  Since they were unable to cook the missing bits, we asked for a refund on the order. Their reply was \"We don't give refunds.\" This is unacceptable as this was clearly their mistake that they were unable to correct! We did not eat any of what they had given us. They still refused to give us our money back.  I ended up having to contact my credit card company and report fraud to get the (rather expensive) meal refunded.

The meat selections could have been just a tad bit more seasoned, but the sauce was so tasty it didn't even matter. I had the Super Combo and my friend had the C-Port Platter (both photos shown). The corn was tender and flavorful after it sat in the butter sauce. The crab clusters were steamed to perfection to the point where the shell was still firm and the meat slid out when you cracked it. The lobster meat melted in your mouth, as it should. The portions are appropriate, but I wished I had two pieces of sausage instead of only one. I'll also say I hate the fact the steamed shrimp still had all the shells on them. I would've been OK with the tail shell, but it made things very difficult to remove the whole shell with already slippery hands. If you're in the area, definitely go. I would definitely even suggest making a special trip if you can turn it into a day trip. Kudos!",

I get the veggie plate which consists of potatoes, corn and sausage and itssm so worth it! The other plates look delicious as well and they never skimp on a plate! You get a lot of food for the price so dont worry about it being too expensive because you're getting more than enough! The wait staff is always very friendly and the atmosphere is family friendly! Dont feel like sitting? Order ahead and pick up your food for an easy on the go meal!!",

    "text": "Seafood Connection lives up to its hype for sure. My brother and I wanted something different for Super Bowl Sunday and we both agreed on Seafood Connection. Luckily he was willing to drive all the way to the restaurant in the rain to pick the food up for us. They do not have a phone number where you can call in so you just have to pray they are not sold out of whatever you are wanting.  Luckily they were only sold out of fried and grilled food?? So we went with the steamed Super C-Port platter. Once placing the order the food was ready in 15 minutes. It may come in a normal size Styrofoam to-go box it is PACKED with food. A Super C-Port platter can definitely feed about 3-4 people.  The sauce in the box is what makes everything so good. I can not even describe the butter sauce but it is soooo good! The seafood is quality and hearty. They definitely do not give you small, skimpy crab legs, lobster tails or shrimp that is not worth the money. Everyone agreed the sausage was amazing and I am in love with the corn on the cob. Unfortunately they are only opened on Friday-Sunday but it is definitely worth making a trip and trying.",

    "text": "I heard the all of the buzz and decided to check it out on my own.  I've heard the wait was an hour, cash only, shady setup, etc.  As I'm typing this even I wonder why I would subject myself to this place.   I trolled SC on Facebook for a week or so to try to see how the starts would align and allow me to subject myself to a train wreck of an experience.   Apparently the seafood is extremely fresh and is brought in from coastal Georgia.  They are only open when they have a shipment.  Sooooo, today was the day.  They were open and welcoming all cash carrying seafood lovin' patrons and I was willing to oblige.  I pull into the parking lot, walk into The King of Spicy, yes they are housed up in another restaurant, and follow the dry erase marker arrows to the bar to place my order.  Man, I must be livin' life right because the wait was nothing!  I waited in line about 3-4 minutes to place my order.  The lady taking my order was extremely nice and helpful.  She was quick but I didn't feel rushed.  Once I handed over the cash I was given a number and told it would be ready shortly.  Based on the number of people sitting around with that \"I'm waiting for my food\" look I didn't expect \"shortly\" to happen.  I decided to walk around for a few, check emails, blah, blah, blah.  About 20 minutes later, my number came up.  First, that's about the heaviest bag of food I've ever carried but once I opened it I knew why.  This plate was packed with shrimp, lobster, sausage, corn and potatoes all smothered in a butter sauce.  Put on a bib cause it's fittin' to get messy!  This was a plate full of happiness!  I would have been happy to wait that hour or whatever everyone else was saying.  The shrimp and lobster were well cooked, not rubbery or over cooked at all.  The sausage was a nice touch but almost a distraction of the main attraction - the seafood.",

    "text": "I was in Charlotte for the NBA All Star 2019 weekend & I decided to visit this restaurant that I had been following for a while on Instagram. I figured since they have a huge following the food must be good approximately 77,000 Followers! Immediately when we arrived there was a huge parking lot which was great because it was super BUSY as we expected it to be! When we walked to the front door my friend & I were greeted by a very polite security who advised us for dine in the wait was going to be around 2 hours. We declined and said we want to place to go orders, he allowed us in and pointed us to the bar area. The line for the to go orders was wrapped around the entire bar but very structured. My friend and I looked over the menu, talked to others in line and enjoyed the nice music selection. We waited in line for 1 hour to place our order. I ordered the lock jaw plate which is supposed to consist of 1 lobster tail, shrimp, potatoes, corn.. I also added to my order a seasoned egg (2), sausages, 1 pint crab rice & an Arnold Palmer (half tea/half lemonade) to drink my total was $43. My friend ordered fried fish & shrimp her total was $20. After waiting 45 minutes her food was ready, my food however took 1hr & 10 mins to come out after ordering. So in total we waited 2hrs + to order and receive food. The staff at Seafood Connection advises you to check your food before leaving for accuracy. Immediately when I checked the rice I noticed it was very small but smelled sooo good! When I opened my lockjaw plate it didn't look seasoned at all it literally looked like melted \"Parkay or I can't believe it's not butter\" was drowning my food.. it really didn't look good but I figured because they were so busy and have a huge following I'm sure it's going to taste amazing. My drink was very good not too sweet but perfect blend of tea & lemonade. When I got in my car I opened my food and began to eat it... the rice was definitely the best it had a few crab shells in it but what do you expect with fresh crab meat. The lockjaw plate however was terrible it truly was not worth the money , the only enjoyable part of the plate was the sausages. Everything else lacked seasoning & the lobster tail was so small they cut 1 lobster tail in half to make it look like your getting 2, the corn was super sweet which I don't like. I understand it was a busy weekend for this business but even when i posted it on my social media some of my followers said they went there and did not like it either. Would I go back for the food? NO! But the customer service was amazing! I love seafood and they didn't live up to my expectation at all.. if you like long wait times, margarine sauce, pricey food this is the place for you!",

Which leads me to my point, the sauce was just SALTY (tastes likes ramen seasoning packets) mixed with pounds of melted butter. I have yet to try their fried menu. But if there was more sauce options it would definitely bring more customers.",

Someone suggested seafood connection and the pics looked so tempting i delayed my stay about 30 mins. The front door was locked but luckily, i saw a couple walk towards a side entrance and i followed. There is a sign stating they're under construction...not sure what the place was like before construction but i knew the food was going to be LIT as soon as I walked it.  You get in line to place your order, you're given a number then you sit and wait for your number to be called. I didn't wait too long(15 mins) before my number was called. I ordered the Steamed Crablegs Plate($30) and there was a thick ass layer of butter on everything i had a heart attack but who cares.  There is no place to sit and eat so it's all to go. I asked for wet wipes but they didn't have any and my container was so full, it wouldn't close so i knew I needed a lot of room(vehicle not sufficient) to spread and eat.   I drove back home to GA to eat. Quickly reheated everything and my goodness....I've never eaten that many crablegs and wanted more. The potatoes and corn were also delectable. The flavor involves a whole lot of garlicky seasoning and it melds so well with the tender crab meat. I have never been so sad and still hungry after a huge meal as this so I'll definitely swing by again next time I'm in Charlotte!",

    "text": "I've been seeing this place in my Facebook feed for weeks. The pics are crazy delicious looking, the comments of glowing praise almost cult-like. I had to go check it out for myself. Is the hype real? Yes.   First things first, follow them on their social medias to see when they are open and what hours. It's kind of all over the place, and they could close early if they sell out of everything.  Currently, this pop up type business is sharing a kitchen with the Indian restaurant King of Spicy. When you walk through the door, KOS is to the left and Seafood Connection operates out of the bar to the right. There's a bouncer who greets you (why is there a bouncer? I have no clue). He'll point you to the line to place your order. I went the day before Easter at a random mid-afternoon time. There wasn't that long of a line. I've heard it can get crazy, crazy busy. So, just be prepared. I've heard it does move quick. Also, don't wait too late in the day in case they do get slammed and run out of things. I went with the Connect Platter (lobster and crab legs). Along with the crab leg cluster and lobster, it includes a piece of sausage, corn on the cob, potatoes and a couple deviled eggs. Total with tax was $30. This is a cash-only concept. There is an ATM at the restaurant.   Note: there's not a ton of places to sit here. They pack up the orders in a to-go fashion, I would plan to take it home and enjoy. If you don't like butter and seasoning, you won't enjoy this. It's not healthy by any means, but it's pretty damn delicious. Everyone here was so nice and it didn't take long to get my food. I will definitely be back.",

The first thing I noticed was that there were a lot of staff congregated around the hostess station when we arrived.  We had a party of 3 and were told 45 minutes but was seated within 20 minutes.  The wait came after ordering.  We waited over 45 minutes for our food.  I asked a lady passing by for a refill on drinks and  was told that the waiter would get it.  I asked passing by employees twice to no avail for refills on drinks.  Note that there were still staff hanging at the hostess station but I couldn't get a refill on ice tea.   We got the refill at the same time as our food about 25 minutes later.  We had steamed and fried items.  Both were barely luke warm.  The fried fish and fries were cold.  The steamed pot that contained shrimp/crab legs/sausage/potatoes etc. was cold.  Imagine the butter sauce had cooled and the steamed food was a cold grease mess.  I don't mind hot butter but hot butter was now cold grease.   This place left a bad first impression.",

My wife and I went to this restaurant for lunch after church on Sunday we were expecting and I sit down seafood lunch what we got was fast food added to the service at sitdown prices extremely high sit down prices the cheapest lunch was $12-$65. It took several minutes in a half empty restaurant for the waitress to come to our table and asked for drinks order. When she came back with our drinks they were in Styrofoam cups again fast food attitude. I ordered the two piece fish only option is flounder and my wife ordered the crabcakes and grits when I got my order approximately 25 minutes later it came in a plastic basket like you would get it Captain D's and my wife's game in a nice bowl at this time point we had to ask for silverware which took several minutes to get back while our food is getting cold. The slogan for this restaurant is it Hass to be the sauce I asked the waitress for tartar sauce and catch up while I got was tartar sauce catchup packets again fast food attitude. By this time I was very frustrated and asked for to go boxes before I had a bite. When I got home of the fish was actually pretty good and my wife's was not Her crabcake was not made from lump crab it was made from the same mixture you would get in at deviled crab entree. So if you're looking for a fast food restaurant service in a sit down restaurant with extremely high lunch prices this is the restaurant for you.",

    "text": "Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor.  This is beyond \"mid-renovation\" this is your play-cousin trying to cater out of a closed down Alcoholics Anonymous meeting space.    Beat up.    Dirty.  Low lighting.  Taking orders from a fucking plastic card table like it's a garage sale.  No tables, a few folding chairs for the poor souls who are eating there.  For the price, I'd rather sit in a restaurant that is clean, ready to serve with cleanliness and aesthetics taken into consideration.  I'm shocked out of my mind that anyone would eat here.  This place is not ready to be open.  If you don't have cash to open a nice place, you can keep all the crab claws.  I'm not here for this, ever.",

My BFF and I ordered our food over the phone to go since they're slow.. we're on our lunch break.  There were around 20 empty tables so we ask could we sit and eat instead .  A lady by the name of Kim told the hostess No and she'll come by to explain.. it took her so long to come to us that we left .  I'm trying to understand why we couldn't sit and eat when the food was purchased from them ???? I told my entire department about this .. this is my last time coming and besides I spent $30 for lunch !!!",

I ordered the steamed shrimp but the only thing in the plate worth eating was the sausage. Everything else was gross and \"warm\". The shrimp was very pasty. Didn't taste like shrimp at all. The corn was lathered in semi melted butter. Not worth the $20 I spent. At all.",

The wait is long though (about a hour) to get the food to go, but more than worth it! We usually spend $70 per person as we each get a Super C Port or when they have special Panther Pans.",

The person that manages their Facebook account none to politely advised me if I don't want to stop at my bank and withdraw cash or use the ATM at the restaurant I could \"support the movement or take your business elsewhere\". To say I was and AM appalled is an understatement. I will never give them one dollar of my money which is unfortunate",

As soon as we got home we tried the crab legs & shrimp but was not happy. The shrimp were mush as well as the crab legs. The seafood did not seem fresh. Way to much butter sauce. I was advised the sausage was beef but definitely was not. I tried to call multiple times but no answer on 12/22. I did finally get in contact with a manager on 12/23. She was very professional & apologetic. She did advise me they ordered different shrimp then usual. She stated bring my receipt next time and they will replace the meals. I look forward to our next visit and will update review at that time.   ***Visit update 1/5 happy to say after a long discussion with manager she replaced all food. They would not do sauce on side but stated they can do lite. I am happy they made it right & for that I added 3 star review",

Long wait, poor customer service and food is meh. My boyfriend and I both got the c-port platter. His was deep fried  and mines was stream. We got home and realized they had forgotten the clusters of crab legs on my boyfriend's platter. Try calling them to complain...what do you know, the phone they had on their receipt was not in service. WTH? The potatoes with the steam platter was so mushy...you might as well be eating mash potatoes with your seafood. The sauce is nothing but butter. It was so salty I couldn't finish my platter. There was no dipping sauce for the deep fried platter. Wanted to try this place out because of the hype. Was so disappointed. We overpaid for a bad experience.",
