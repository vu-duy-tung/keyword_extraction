The thing I like is the mini burger you get to choose! It's like a little same then next time you can get the actual burger! I forgot the name of the spring roll we got, but it was so good!!! Worth the price! It's a trendy restaurant and I recommend everyone to go there!!",

    "text": "This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte based off of a couple of things. 1. The menu is very vast (almost too vast at points though) so you are bound to find something that suits your fancy. 2. The atmosphere is great - crowded but not too crowded, cool artwork on the walls, awesome bar with a giant salt water fish tank that spans the front wall, great outdoor seating by the fountain if that suits your fancy. 3. The food is YUM (the Bento box is my favorite as you get a little of everything, burger and sushi). 4. Love that when you enter the bathroom the background \"music\" is 3 voice where one is a sentence in English, one in Redneck and one in Japanese!  5. The service has always been top notch! 6. They have a combination burger and sushi option that is called Burgushi...novel ideal!   Biggest draw back to me is that there is ALWAYS a wait and reservations are hard to come by unless you make then well in advance. Also, not a fan of no drink specials on the weekend.    Overall, a fun place that I will continue to support.",

The decor is part of the appeal..very modern with a \"fake\" fish tank that looks like a ginormous iPad, a real fish tank, and a poster that mimics \"Wicked\". The waitress was knowledgable, attentive, and efficient. The menu is EXTENSIVE to say the least...everything from sushi to burgers to shakes to everything in between. I would try more if I could come back! Half priced martini - I got the Asian Orchid which was delicious. I got their specialty - Burgushi, which was very filling. The owner was very personable and came around to say hello after our meal and ask how everything was, and gave us all coupons that I will definitely be giving to a local as to not waste it!",

    "text": "Cowfish is interesting.  It's good, but it's pricey.    First off, the menu is HUGE.  I will say it may be the largest menu I have ever seen in my life, outside of some wine lists.  If you've ever seen the Gordon Ramsey show \"Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares\", well Gordon would have a heart attack at the amount of items on the menu.  It took us over 20 minutes to order and may have been close to 30.  Once you get over the size of the menu, the food is pretty good, and the service is very attentive.    We ordered a burger and some sushi.  Burger first:  It was good - on par with the previous tenant of the space, Custom Counter.  Fries too.  There are other places in Charlotte that have better burgers, but it was not bad.  Sushi - Again, it was good, but not the best in Charlotte.  I still believe Nikko's has the best sushi in town.  However, Cowfish is just as expensive as Nikko's.  And the atmosphere at Nikko's is better. And the sushi was prepared a bit better.  So, for the same price and better quality, why should I not go to Nikko's?  Short answer - I don't know.  I'm not a Cowfish hater, it was just more expensive than I would have expected for the quality.  They allow you to order a custom roll - so whatever you want on it, they will make it.  I had an inside out roll with yellowtail and jalapenos.  It was good and I would get the same thing again, with extra jalapenos though!  In summary, good but expensive sushi, decent burger.      Side note:  They have a bunch of different milkshakes at Cowfish, but their blender sounds like a dentist's drill, so I beg you to avoid that if you can.",

We had been talking about going there for awhile and with the wait being a little long we took two seats at the bar. The food was fantastic, the bartenders were great and even with all the people fluttering all around we had a really good time.   The next day my mother-in-law, sister-in-law and nephew (all of whom I love) came to visit and on the Saturday we took them to Cowfish as we knew our nephew would love it. We had a great time, great food and the kicker for him was the language lessons in the bathrooms where they teach you to say certain phrases in English, Spanish and Redneck! He was thrilled.   Well the next day we were looking for a place to go and here's the part where it might not have turned out so great, with a choice for lunch in all of Charlotte our nephew picked Cowfish again! (I think the fried pickles and the language lessons were a big draw) Anyway it was still great and I can highly recommend it to everyone especially now with the fountain on and the live music on weekend nights.",

The menu is quite lengthy.  The pricing makes it difficult to build your own sandwich without paying through the nose.  They have done away with the smaller meat options, like the 1/3 lb burger, so you have to bring your appetite.  Some sauces and add-ons are no longer available.  The delicious milkshakes did survive the transition!  The menu steers Cowfish to being more of a dinner place than a lunch place, which is a disappointment.  Worth a visit, but fans of The Counter, don't set your hopes high when you go.  Cowfish is definitely geared more strongly toward the eeZ Fusion crowd.",

    "text": "Is something really \"hype\" or \"hyped up\" if it fully lives up to its expectations?  Coming from out of town, I had not heard any \"hype\" about Cowfish. I was just in the area and as usual, let trusty Yelp guide me to a place that looked good.  I read a few reviews to get an idea of what to order, but it was not until I started to read more, that I realized that this restaurant had a reputation to live up to.  We were intrigued that this restaurant specialized in two things our family loved: burgers (my husband & boys) and sushi (me!).  Starving, we made our way over for lunch on a Friday, only to be told it would be a half hour wait.  The wait was only about 20 minutes, which gave me a chance to explore the lengthy menu and look at yelp reviews for food suggestions. We were all ready to go when the very friendly server came for our order.   Warning:  I think just reading what we ate for appetizers might give one coronary artery disease!  The two Moms and their teenage daughters (eating their salads) sitting at the next table looked at us in both horror and envy as we chowed. All I could tell them was, \" Eating is different with little boys!\"  They laughed and said, \"We wish we got what you did!\" We had:  Coconut Battered Onion Rings ($6), served with a horseradish aioli & Thai sweet dipping sauce. I am not usually an onion ring fan but i did taste these, especially because I love to dip. They were huge, crunchy,& delicious! Crab Rangoon Dip ($11) - great recommendation by yelpers! Unusual, creamy, yummy! Parmesan Truffle Fries ($8) - with Parmesan cheese & bacon. So tasty! Really sinful!  The apps alone left me stuffed!  They have more unusual burgers at Cowfish than I have ever seen. Husband & 11 year old shared two: 1) the Hunka Hunka Burnin Love ($16):  Yes, a burger with peanut butter, fried bananas, & bacon. You could almost hear Elvis singing! It was good, but not as great as burger #2) the Arnold Hamandegger ($13):  cheese, ham, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions, cowfish sauce, onion roll.   9 year old and I each had our own Bento Boxes. These are combo meals with a mini burger, sushi roll, thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries, & edamame. It is really the best of both worlds and it was a fantastic choice!    9 year old got the Cowfish Bento Box ($9) which came with a plain mini burger and he chose a Philly Roll, which he loved. I got the Ultimate Bento Box. I really did not care much about the double stack featured mini burger. I thought it was somewhat dry and I just tasted it. I got the ultimate because I wanted to try one of the special rolls.  There are many unique rolls (as well as sashimi, nigiri). You can even create your own roll. I tried \"The Boss\" and it was original, satisfying, and delicious:  Spicy tuna, kani salad, cucumbers inside, coated in tempura flakes, topped with avocado, tuna, etc.   Service was very friendly and efficient.  Our server even pointed out that Joey Fatone was in the house. Woo hoo!  The manager (possibly owner?) stopped by to see how everything was and I begged him to open a place in Fort Lauderdale.   Proof enough we loved this place?",

I finally reached out to a manager walking by and he advises he went on break, someone should have informed you, (You think? was my first thought)  Then he did reword it correctly by someone should have picked up the slack and we dropped the ball.   This mangers name \"CHRIS\", He was a super hero flying in to fix an issue that should never have happened, seamless is the word that comes to mind.  He took our check and charged us and as the Chris is standing there he says \"wait let me take care of that.\"  The wife was extremely upset and man I have never had such bad luck with service as we have had since moving to Charlotte and it is always with the wife's food or special occasions.  I Hope CSBB takes this an educational moment and improves their service with this review.  No matter how good you think you are the DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.  Thank You Chris for saving the day and we will be back again and again.",

I had the mushroom burger which was really good, we also had the tuna nachos for appetizer, those were good as well. The only reason why I am giving it a 3 star ( I wish it had a 3.5 star, rather) is because the service was super SLOW. It took almost 10 mins just to get me a drink and they were not busy. I will comeback though when I'm not in a hurry, their burgers are worth it",

We shared three items - the minis of the week, the fried pickles and the Miss Muffitt roll. The minis were just he right amount of burger. The pickles were hot, crisp and sour just like you'd want the perfect fried pickle to be. My issue last time with the sushi is it was too big but this roll was the right size! $40 before tip between the two of us - not so bad. The menu is still huge - take your time and don't order too much or go with a big group and take advantage of being able to try more that way.",

Just recently went here over this past weekend and was blown away by yet again. The Cowfish has a HUGE selection of food - not just sushi. I've tried at least 5 rolls and all their Bento Boxes (highly recommend the Brento Box); all have been delicious. The burgers are to die for. The cocktails are also freakin' awesome. You can really tell they care about all the ingredients that go into each drink. I had the Bacon (something, something) cocktail and ended up having 3. Friends of mine tried just about every other cocktail on the menu, and were very pleased.   I would highly recommend the South Park location to anyone. If you want drinks, just apps, or a full dinner, this is definitely a go-to!",

The menu appeared straight forward. They had burgers and sushi, both of which I love on their own... but fusing them together to make burgushi?! What an unexpectedly delicious and unique concept.  To start, we had Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos which were wonton chips with a dollop of the house-made crab rangoon dip accompanied by pico de gallo and avocado topped with a slice of blackened ahi tuna seared rare and mixed greens. Fresh and delicious. I ordered the Mediterranean Lamb Burger for my entree. I've had many Mediterranean inspired burgers all over and this one had to be the best. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flash fried wedge of feta cheese on the burger was a nice touch.  Everything from the service to the food was excellent. I look forward to my next trip to Charlotte just so I can eat here again.",

They have meat \"sushi\", raw fish in other presentations (faux burgers, etc.)...you name it.  Plus, a full bar with tons of great drink options.   The only downside is the noise level in this place.  All hard surfaces and usually packed.  It's like having dinner in a football stadium during a game. That being said, the ambiance is great.  The decor is eclectic and original (or, probably ripped off from a NYC restaurant).  It's a restaurant that you'll really enjoy visiting.",

Love the overall feel of this trendy place!  Food- This is where the two star rating stems from. The food was disappointing. I mean a cool concept for sure, they literally combine sushi and burgers! However, maybe there is a reason that few other restaurants do this. I ordered the Lobster and Filet minion roll, good idea right? I mean it's basically surf and turf! No. The steak was raw, like raw. I am well aware that sushi is raw fish, but raw steak? no. The menu did say it was rare. Tip: Rare=raw! In addition, the steak was overly seasoned and the rest of the roll fell flat. My boyfriend ordered the \"taste Explosion\" which is a burger put into sushi format. I sampled and enjoyed this roll! Although, it cost $15 the same as the burgers so I mean, why not get a burger?  Overall, this place is cool. It's spendy-costing at least $15 a person. I would like to try again and find something more \"normal\" with other positive reviews it has to have something in the food category right?",

So when i arrived there to get my food, I was told to go to the bar,(where i was ignored)!!!   So finally, I walked over to a podium where I saw employees standing, so that i could check on my food order. As they were getting my food together, I saw and heard one of the employees look at me, laugh, and say, \"O wow is that the guy,\" then he started laughing, but what shocked me was that he was laughing with the lady who was getting my food,(who I think is a manager)!! I feel like no one should be laughed at and talked about and to add insult to injury, he was doing it right in front of my face.. That juvenile and rude behavior is completely unacceptable!!!!!!! So with that being said, \"Does anybody want a $20 gift card because I will not be returning back!!!\"",

After my previous review of  the not so tasty crab Rangoon dip, co-owner Marcus Hall reached out to us to offer a chance to make things right. Our service by LeAnne was good and attentive. We appreciated managers Ronald Cruces and Mickey checking on us periodically.  The crab Rangoon dip recipe has changed but for the better.  This dip was creamier and chock full of crabmeat something missing from our last visit. Delicious! Very nice to see a business take the time to ensure their patrons are happy which yields  repeat business.  Keep up the good job Cowfish!",

My favorite is the Blackened Tuna Nachos..which mix the Crab Rangoon Dip (my 2nd favorite app), guacamole, ahi tuna, sprouts all on top of a wonton.  Sounds crazy, looks crazy and tastes amazing!  For dinner, the selections are also endless.  I always order a mixture of rolls..must have Riggs Roll (topped with a crab cake), and Mark' Roll (all around hotness!)!  For desert do not miss the milkshakes!  I can not pick a favorite because I get a different one every time!    If there is a wait, it is worth it.  Also ask your waiter for a menu tour and you will have an even harder time deciding!  Great for families, friends, entertaining, first dates, and any other occasion you may be celebrating!

    "text": "I had dinner here a few weeks back for the first time! I have heard a lot of hype about this place and finally decided to check it out.  It was a weekday night, so not very crowded and we got seated right away.  We had an attentive waiter and he answered most of my questions to my satisfaction, but the menu is very long and so I cannot blame him for not knowing everything on it!  I was definitely in the mood for sushi, so ordered two specialty rolls.  Not having been here before, at first glance I thought the prices for the fusion rolls were on the higher end, but the rolls are fairly substantial.  I couldn't finish both of the rolls I ordered that night.  I wanted to have a glass of red wine, so I asked the waiter for his suggestions for a pinot noir and decided to go with the one he suggested.  I was highly disappointed with the quality of the wine, and in retrospect probably should have sent it back, but oh well.    Overall, though, my experience was pleasant and the food was very tasty.  It's definitely not a place I would frequent often but definitely a place I will return, since the menu has quite a lot of delicious sounding dishes!   Pros: Nice service, cute decor and not too noisy (at least on a weeknight) so you can have a conversation with the people at your table and the sushi was really tasty!   Cons: I think the sushi prices are a little higher than expected especially the speciality rolls, compared to other sushi places I go to, and the quality of the sushi is wonderful but not beyond other good sushi restaurants for the price point.  The pinot noir the waiter recommended was mediocre, and maybe that was just an isolated incidence.  I may just stick to beer or cocktails when I go there next time. Lastly, the menu is HUGE and extensive, hence,  making it somewhat daunting to read through, especially the build your own sushi section. I would have loved to have built my own roll, but that page is not easy to maneuver through and since I am NO sushi making expert, I was hoping to rely on my waiter, but was not able to really help guide me through that particular page.",

I have been to The Cowfish several times before and the food was excellent every time.  Yesterday, however, it took almost half an hour for our food to come out and when it did my food was lukewarm.  I am not usually one to complain, but this was really unbearable.  I ordered the fusion bento box, which comes with a sushi roll, mini burger, edamame, sweet potato fries and spicy cucumbers.  Everything that was supposed to be hot was cold, except for the edamame.    I told our waittress who was more than happy to bring me out a new order.  Before my new order arrived, the manager came over, sincerely apologized and told us (my boyfriend and I) that our entire meal was taken care of.  Yes, most restaurants will take one person's meal off the bill if it is not right, but this was simply above and beyond standard restauarant customer service.  You can tell this restaurant truly cares about customer satisfaction and wants everyone to have a great experience there.    One piece of food advice: get the crab rangoon dip for an appetizer, it is amazing!",

    "text": "After moving to Charlotte less than two months ago, I decided tonight was the night to go to The Cowfish.  My mother is visiting from out of town and, as a single mother, was obligated to bring my five-month-old son.  Before making the choice to dine at The Cowfish, I looked up their website and read the \"About\" section to make sure this was, indeed, a family friendly restaurant.  The Cowfish website claims they are \"a fun-loving environment that anyone can enjoy \" and customers are encouraged to \"bring the entire family for a meal \".  However, upon arriving at the restaurant, it was glaringly obvious that our patronage was not wanted.    We were told there would be a 10-20 minute wait--which was completely acceptable for a Saturday evening--however, as we sat on the bench outside the restaurant, we watched at least 5 other parties of 2 be seated as soon as they walked through the door.  After about 30 minutes, I asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be. She promised we were the next party on the list and that they were cleaning our table.  Ten minutes minutes passed by (along with two other parties) and we decided to go elsewhere.    I understand that children are not always welcomed in certain restaurants.  Out of respect for those businesses and the adults who choose to dine in such establishments, I purposefully choose places to eat that will accommodate young kids.  Imagine my disappointment when I found out the hard way that The Cowfish is, in fact, not a family friendly place and that they do not welcome people from \"all walks of life\".  At least they live up to the promise of making an experience at their restaurant a \"memorable experience\".  I hope this restaurant adjusts its website to reflect the atmosphere and clientele it wishes to serve--or that they adjust their attitude.  I've never been treated so poorly by a wait staff!",

    "text": "I had visited this location back in April and I had a great experience. The service was great and the food was great, so I had no reason to expect anything less than great service when I visited last weekend. I was VERY disappointed to say the least. I ordered the lobster and crab egg rolls to share with my girlfriend and we both ordered burgers. The appetizers came out quickly and they were delicious......but that is where the \"positive\" ends. When I ordered my burger, I asked to add pickles. When the burger came out, there were no pickles. I took 2 bites and noticed that my burger was a little \"cool\". I cut my burger in half and it was PINK and cool to the touch. The pink meat started to crumble and fall onto the plate when I touched it. The burger was cooked long enough to brown it on the outsides but the inside was RAW. My girlfriends burger was also under cooked but not as badly as mine was. We called the waiter over and showed him the burger and he mumbled \"it was supposed to be well done\". No apologies or anything. When the new burgers came out, mine still had no pickles, and it looked \"thrown together\" like someone was in a rush to get it out. My girlfriend ordered the Jalapeno popper burger which is supposed to have fried jalapenos on it but her new burger had no fried jalapenos but instead a huge pile of raw sliced jalapenos. We decided to order desserts and I saw that they had a tall cake dessert made with \"moist\" pound cake which sounded delicious and there was also a cheesecake dessert. So I ordered the the pound cake dessert and my girlfriend ordered the cheesecake. While we were ordering, the waiter told us that he thinks the milkshakes are a better dessert than the actual items listed on the dessert menu. We should have taken his advice and just ordered the milkshakes. The \"moist\" pound cake in my dessert were more like hockey pucks and my girlfriends cheesecake was just bland and tasteless. It didn't taste anything like cheesecake and was really disappointing. My girlfriend called the waiter over and asked him to take the desserts back. My waiter now had an attitude and did not say anything else to us. I guess we were supposed to eat raw burgers and disgusting desserts. Just don't send them back? He handed us the check moments later, returned my girlfriends credit card, and walked away from the table and never came back. No good night, No thank you for coming.   One thing that I look forward to when dining out is \"CONSISTENCY\". I don't want to have terrible service one day, good service the next, and then have it be terrible again by the 3rd visit. Fortunately for my server, I am a good tipper so I left a $10 tip on a $40 tab for mediocre service and terrible food. Unfortunately I will never be back to this restaurant. There are plenty of great restaurants here in Charlotte where I can get great service and food on every visit. Too bad Cowfish is not one of them.",

    "text": "When I think about the restaurants I love they all have something in common other than my endearment- my parents would probably like them too. I think that's what sold me on Cowfish. Sure it's got a hip, swank, rather loud vibe going on, but the food is solid all the way around.   I wasn't with my parents but I was with a friend with a meat & potatoes palate so Cowfish was a no brainer. I get my sashimi, tasty drinks, and a bison burger, and he gets his Dr. Pepper, Chocolate milkshake, and lamb burger (stripped of everything, of course) and everybody is happy and full. Btw- the bison burger here was hands down one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had- props to putting chipotle seasoning to good use! If the price is deterring you a bit- it might help to realize you'll probably have a take home box so it's plenty of food for the average eater.   A couple ok parts: our server seemed a bit exhausted- and watching some of the other servers they all seemed a bit \"eh\" but overall it was still a great experience. Oh...I'm going to sound really old saying this, but the music was rather loud.",

    "text": "Def a really unique concept for a restaurant.  The menu is pretty expansive.  We went for lunch and there was a 45 minute wait!  It's so close to South Park Mall I feel it's probably rare that they are not on a wait on a Saturday or Sunday.  The menu offers such a wide variety of things from sushi, bento box combos, to hamburgers and shakes.  I love a good sushi roll, so I generally don't stray from that side of the menu.  My fiance had the turkey burger.  Amazing.  It was a typical burger with a goat cheese and sun-dried tomato toppings with micro greens that really set it apart.  He chose the sweet and spicy cucumbers as his side and they did not disappoint either.  I went with the Doug's filet roll.  It is topped with a seared rare filet and stuffed with crab, avocado, and cream cheese.  It was just ok.  I was hoping for something a little more wow, but it was a good roll.  (Different than your typical sushi).  They have a lamb roll and a bbq roll that I am dying to try, so I will be returning for sure.    The only con to this place is the crowds.  It is good and large, so the wait tends to move a little quicker, but the waiting area isn't conducive for large crowds (luckily the bar has lots of room).  I love the concept of this place and the menu for its sheer difference to the rest of the restaurants in South Park.  If you're going to go here, don't eat for the day so you can try a bunch of different things!  There is too much to choose from in just one meal!",

    "text": "This place is so exciting. This was my second visit and I cannot wait to go back. It's the kind of place where you have a hard time picking something on the menu because there are so many good choices. Because of this, I would recommend coming here for a birthday party or some sort of celebration and ordering off the menu to share. This time I enjoyed the firecracker sushi roll, which was delicious. The service was fast and friendly. My friend got the poke tuna which was also very good. What I did not realize is that, Cowfish has bento boxes on the menu. This might be a good choice if you're new to sushi and not really sure you want to order a entire roll. What you'll get with bento is sushi roll ( a couple selections made for bento), and a burger ( also a couple selections you can choose from). This way you get the best of both worlds!!!  The decor is modern, trendy, great for a date. They also have a large covered patio and bar area.",

It has a Sports Bar theme with allot of Bar height tables surrounding a large bar area.       It was crowded the day we went and service suffered as the table set up and under staffing made things take longer than the should.  Our server was great but she had too many tables to take care of and we had to wait for refills etc much longer than normal.      We ordered the Sashimi Como platter,  Blackened Tuna roll, R&R Crab cake roll and Big Al's Tuna Appetizer.  The Combo platter and Big Al's tuna app came up first and wow was I surprised at how fresh and tasty the fish was.  Next came the sushi rolls and they were both unique, fresh and delicious.  Everything we had was very good.  Next time I am in the Charlotte area I will definitely come by to get some more tasty sushi!!!",

They had somehow concocted this entire plan with the restaurant and although there was going to be a wait, they ended up making an exception. My sister and friend said the restaurant was wonderful and helped with everything that she asked. Our server  was wonderful and the manager was awesome. They went above and beyond and I had a wonderful birthday. I will always patronize Cowfish because I always enjoy the food and service.

After sitting at the (mostly open bar), we were not greeted, given menus, or had dirty glassware and napkins cleaned from in front of our face from the previous party.   After about 10 minutes, a male bartender came over, wiped the bar with a dirty smelly rag and tossed some menus in front of us. After taking our order at 8:25, that was the last we would hear from him for the night.   Our food, while quite tasty, did not arrive for 45 minutes.... we watched two other groups arrive at the bar AFTER US, order food, eat, and pay their bill before we received our food.   Our server (male bartender who I will not name) did not even come to close out our check without me asking him to do so.   Absolutely PITIFUL service. Not sure if this was because we were both in workout gear or what his deal was?? Sufficient to say, my date and I agreed that we will not return to Cowfish in the near future.

We started off our meal with the fried pickles (it comes as pickles and peppers, but they did just pickles for us) -I must say these are the best pickles I have had at any restaurant; avocado tunatini - the boys said this was excellent. We then moved on to the main course of an avocado bacon burger with a side of bacon slaw cooked a perfect medium- yum; build your own roll of lobster, salmon, cucumber, avocado with white rice in a soy wrap topped with yellowtail tuna and a perfectly cooked medium rare filet - outstanding; California roll and a tropical storm roll - excellent; bento box with a California roll and longhorn slider that came with sweet potato fries, edamame, and tia cucumbers - excellent; bento box with a California roll and a regular burger, fries, edamame, and tia cucumbers - excellent.  For dessert we had the moose is loose - OMG this is a huge mound of deliciousness!!!!   The food overall was prepared perfectly and to order. The server \"Cooper\" was on point - a glass was never empty, plates cleared when finished to make room for the next, knowledgable and friendly.",

My favorite thing to order is the bento box, since I never know what I'm in the mood for, it's perfect to get to have a mini burger, sushi, edamame & sweet potato fries all in one meal! Best of both worlds! Pro tip: Cowfish has the most entertaining bathrooms.",

    "text": "Cowfish had a 45 minute wait to be seated on a Friday so we decided to eat at the bar which was expansive and comfortable. The decor is contemporary and fun! The virtual fish tank that displays your \"sea animal\" name and lets you know where you are on the waiting list was really cool! A net comes into the tank and catches your fish when it's your turn to be seated. Very creative!  We ordered a  mojito.  It was a standard mojito made with Bacardi.  We ordered two Burgushi Rolls - the Prime Time Filet and Lobster Roll and the All American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi.   The Prime Time  is a lobster and cucumber roll topped with seared seasoned filet mignon, pan-fried portobello mushroom slices tossed in truffle oil, green onions, and spicy mayo served with the most delicious side of pounded ginger sauce! Both of these rolls were incredible but the All American was my favorite roll of the night! This roll has seasoned all natural beef, yellow cheddar cheese, white cheddar cheese, applewood bacon, and red onion wrapped in soy paper and shoestring potatoes then flash fried. It's topped with ketchup, mustard, dill pickle, and tomato and served on top of a delicious sauce!  I really didn't expect to like it. I mean a burger pretending to be a sushi roll? :/   I haven't had anything like this before but I ended up falling in love with this roll! It was rich in flavor but  surprisingly well balanced! I can't believe it! Aaaaand it was served with seasoned fries which were soooo good!  For dessert, I decided to try one of their spiked milkshakes - the No Sleep Til Brooklyn. This milkshake has ice cream, Myer's dark rum, Kahlua, malt, coffee concentrate, and chocolate covered espresso beans! D***! They managed to put three of my favorite things into a shack (dessert, coffee, and liquor)! It was delicious!  I enjoyed my experience at Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar. Try it. You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Burger...Sushi...Burger...Sushi...it's so hard to choose!  Not at Cowfish!  The first time I went here, I thought, \"Ok, a Burger/Sushi place is weird, but I like weird, so let's do this.\"  It didn't disappoint.  Here's why:  1. Their menu is awesome.  Great app selection (I personally had the Crab Dip with wantons with a sweet Thai sauce...yum).  Love the idea of the Bento box so I can have a burger AND sushi (it's a lot of food and I highly recommend and you can swap out side dishes).  They have a pretty nice selection of sushi rolls, but the best part is the Make-Your-Own-Sushi menu.  YES!  Finally, I can get what I WANT!  However, I will warn you, it's a lot of choices, so you have to really have your head in the game to build your rolls.  2. The decor is cool without being over the top.  Cowfish feels almost like a NYC restaurant in Charlotte, just bigger and without the loud lounge music.  Great place to sit at the bar by yourself and have a drink/sushi.  3. The drinks are actually good.  I hate going to a restaurant where they have a cocktail menu, only to be served a bad cocktail.  I had the Skinny Gonzales and I really could have drank like three of them, they were so good (but I didn't).  Fun place to go after work or on the weekend.  It's not too loud so you can have a conversation.  My advice is to know what you're getting into and be daring with your menu choices!  You really can't go wrong.",

The food was very good. I ordered the bento fusion box and customized it. I forgot what roll I ordered (it was wrapped in cucumber) and it was just okay... the large size took away from the pleasure of eating it. The burger/slider I got was s Swiss burger and it was delicious! I wasn't a fan of the cucumber salad but I believe that it is due to personal preference.   Overall, no complaints.",

Bar and sushi bar seating is first come first serve so that could be an option.  In all the times I have been here I don't think I have waited more than 20 minutes.  This is the type of restaurant that if you are with a group everybody should be able to find something on the huge menu that will make them happy.  Several things to choose from, sushi, sashimi, nigiri, salads, burgers and sandwiches, fusion sushi rolls, bento boxes, burgushi, milkshakes, and several deserts.  Tonight me and a coworker started with the shishito peppers, they are served with a jalapeno lime infused oil, these are a favorite.  I ordered the NODA Hop, drop N'roll IPA, nice IPA with citrus and pine notes.  I ordered the chefs deluxe 15 piece sashimi, which includes fresh tuna, salmon, yellowtail, whitefish, eel, sweet shrimp, lobster salad, and octopus.  The sashimi is very fresh and this is the perfect meal.  My coworker ordered the grilled salmon BLT with sweet potato fries and raved about it.  I have never been disappointed at Cowfish!",

It's located right at SouthPark mall which is very convenient if in the area but also not far from other parts of the city. For an appetizer we had edamame with four different types of flavors (smoked, sriracha, sea salt, wasabi ranch) which were all very good! There are so many options to choose from and if you don't like what's already been put together, you can make your own roll which is what I did and actually came out cheaper than what i was going to originally order. You choose your fillings, toppings, base, and any special sauce to add. The type of rice and paper are free as well as some of the toppings. I ordered mine with brown rice and wrapped in soy paper filled with soft shell crab, tempura shrimp, cream cheese, and filet mignon--YUM!! And it was topped with sweet eel sauce. Unfortunately the kitchen ran out of brown rice but it was all good. The manager was so sweet and paid for me and my friends meals! How awesome is that?! Definitely appreciative. 10/10 id definitely recommend and I'll be visiting it's other locations ASAP!",

The menu is HUGE so it took a while for everyone to make a decision. Our table shared an appetizer of crab dip. It was delish! The thai chili sauce on the chips elevated the dish to the next level!   I couldn't decide between burgers and sushi, so I ordered both. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! MY WHOLE LIFE!  My bento box came with a slider, edamame, sushi, and cucumbers. For the slider, you can either choose the burger of the week or one of their other burgers. Note: the slider won't have as much on it as the traditional burger because ,well, it's a slider. Saying that, the slider was amazing! I'm not sure how such a tiny bite of food can be so food - but I have NO REGRETS. I was so upset that I only ordered one & contemplated ordering some to-go. The sushi was good also! My friends ordered burgushi (burgers + sushi) and they LOVED IT!  Overall, this was a really good choice & I can't wait to try the one in Atlanta.",

    "text": "We have a Cowfish in Orlando at City Walk at Universal Studios and I love it!  So when I heard that this Cowfish is the original one, I had to try it out.    I went on a Wednesday evening for dinner with 3 coworkers around 5:30pm.  It was busy but not packed.  We got seated right away at a tall 4 top and our server was very nice.  She took our orders and was very helpful to those who did not understand the large menu.  This Cowfish is much smaller than the one in Orlando.  It was weird to see such a small place.    I normally get a burger of some type but decided to try a Sushi roll combined with meat = Burgushi.   I got the Prime Time Filet and Lobster Roll.  It was very good but I would have liked the meat to be less done.  I asked for med rare but this was more like medium.  Someone else got the Taste Explosion version while the other two guests got Bento boxes.  Everything was good and we enjoyed it all.   Atmosphere = 8   Service = 8  Food = 9  I also enjoyed a Bulleits and Bacon cocktail (one of my favorites!) and we actually had room for dessert.  I enjoyed the Apple filled won tons.  Yum!   Enjoy!",

The first time I went to Cowfish we waited an hour and half to be seated, and an additional half hour to get our meals.  That didn't bother me, it just made me think \"wow, this place has got to be awesome if people are willing to wait this long\".  I was wrong.  People are stupid.  This place is trendy so people THINK it's good.    If you want a trendy spot with better Sushi, try Nikko.  Again, I've had better Sushi for less money, just not in Charlotte.  Their cowboy roll is better than any of the \"Burgushi\" selections I've tried at CF.  FYI - the two star rating reflects price, food, atmosphore, etc... not just the food.  If this place was 20-30% cheaper, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars.",

Tried it a couple of years ago and hated it but since they have raving reviews, we decided to give it another chance last week because I was craving sushi.  First of all their menu is way too overwhelming. Its so much stuff on there that it takes forever to go through the whole menu.  Their sushi is more on the modern Americanized side rather than Japanese style sushi. I ordered a roll and a Yellow tail hand roll and my oh my, the yellow tail in the hand roll was sooooo thickly cut that I could not even bite it apart with my teeth. yuck. Sashimi is NOT supposed to be cut so thick as where you can not bite it in one bite more so not be able to cut it with your teeth.  It was so bad I didn't even bother to eat the rest.  My husband got the burger/sushi box thing with some slider looking thing and a sushi roll. They only thing he liked out of the box was the edamame and sweet potato fries. He didn't even like the burger slider thing and he LOVES meat.  Everything was pretty bad. We definitely will not be returning.",

    "text": "this place is awesome. I can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu. Been here twice after so many people mentioned it-- Was a great time from the ambiance (modern /hip feel) to the meal and drinks. Burgishi (sp?) roll was awesome. I was hesitant about the combo of burger and sushi, but actually the way they combine with the sauces and baking turned out perfect in taste!    Half off sake on thursdays and I'd recommend the 'pearl' sake; The apple sake was way too sweet for my likings.. The key lime drink was pretty fantastic. The pricing is what would be expected for a place such as this..can add up but was worth it.  A great/long bar area too but not much place to stand around it or linger.   The tuna appetizer was fantastic. The 'fries' appetizer was just too much and not that great but everything else on target. The different salads have been lovely, full of flavor too.  Oh, let me add (to address another reviewers comments), that cowfish definently isn't the typical authentic sushi place, so dont come expecting that; It is spin off of the typical items, likely unhealthy for some rolls, but definently delish! Im sure if you are health conscious, there are items on menu to keep with a diet.",

    "text": "First let me say, the food is amazing.  Ahi Tuna Nachos rock my world and all of their specialty sushi rolls make for an interesting meal venture.  What gives this place, to me at least, the full five stars is the customer service.  When managing such an \"in\" place as The Cowfish, everything needs to run smoothly and have a great staff in place.  This was proved last night when the patio was full and the place was packed!  A minor glitch in the system happened when it started pouring rain.  Luckily most tables on the patio were almost finished and hussled out, but my friend and I literally just got our appetizer (the greatest nacho creation ever) and drinks (they carry Bells's!!!).  A few umbrellas were moved and we dined in the rain.  It was beautiful out and the patio was EMPTY.  Made for a great experience and the food couldn't have been better.  The management staff and a few different waiters came to check on us numerous times, braving the rain (which we both kept laughing at) and made it a memerable time.  I will definiatly be going back to the Cowfish, not only for some of the greatest sushi and such a GREAT menu, but for the ultimate customer service that is so hard to find.  KUDOS to the staff!!!",

    "text": "I heard a lot of things about Cowfish so my family and I tried it the other weekend since we were already in the Southpark area. We arrived shortly after they opened and were seated within 10 minutes of getting there. Our server was great. He was friendly and attentive. I ordered the nine piece nigiri and my husband had a roll. I can't tell you which roll he had because I don't eat rolls so I wasn't paying attention. We also had our 18 month old with us, so we ordered the Dragon Bites bento box for him. The Dragon Bites bento is really adorable. There are grilled chicken pieces, apples, fries and a cute little \"sushi\" dessert made from rice krispy treat and a swedish fish wrapped with a thin strip of fruit leather.  This came with a drink, too. I tasted his chicken and it was really good. My nigiri was ok. The sashimi was cut way too big. While some people may love getting huge pieces of sashimi, I don't. It's not nice to look at and even worse it's not great trying to eat it. My husband said his roll was ok - over sauced, but ok. Preparing sushi and sashimi is an art that few people master and accomplish so they can be called an itamae. I know this place isn't anything close to being a real sushi bar, but I was hopeful when I probably shouldn't have been, given the name and the fact that they serve \"burgushi\" (shiver).",

Now for some odd reason, I was fully prepared to have my first big yelp let down here.... Maybe it was the concept that seemed so foreign, who knows? Looking back, I laugh at my initial thought process.   Sadly, my travels often have me traveling by my lonesome, which means a lot of meals where my dining companion is the bartender. Numerous times, I've gone to restaurants where the bartender is ice cold, makes no suggestions, and offers no input on the city I'm currently in. My bartender at cowfish - Jeff M - was the polar opposite of that. Dude was straight up welcoming, friendly, offered several menu suggestions; essentially what any bar owner should be looking for in a bartender. When he learned I was from out of town, he gave me a list of several other restaurants off the beaten path. It's a pretty intense list I was given... Bfast, fried chicken, bars, etc  Anyway, the food here is wonderful. I was a little reserved on the filet mignon wrapped sushi roll but it was a flavor party in my mouth; as was the Marc's roll. I'm only in town for a few days, but I look forward to going back and trying some other menu items!   Kindly bring a cowfish to nj. Thank you",

You don't like sushi, no problem, they have burgushi!  What is that you say??? Super cool, Americanized burger sushi.  It might not sound too good but it's Amazing!  While you might have to wait for a table, the wait goes fast and once you're seated the service is great!  They also have these delicious garlic cheese truffle fries, that could be a meal by themselves.  If you are a sushi fan, or you want to try sushi then you have to try The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar.  It's also a great place for groups or date night.  It's a super trendy place, with a great vibe and great food.",

We went during the week and waited about 30 minutes, which is much more acceptable. But the food was great. The two of us split a burger and split a sushi item and both were really good. All in all, I would recommend this place, but apparently not on a weekend due to the wait.",

They weren't anything special. For dinner I got the Surf and Turf Burgushi. It took forever for it to come out and once it did, it was ice cold. I wasn't really expecting to eat cold, ground beef crumbles. At least my martini was delicious!  The second time I went was nearly a year later. Wanting to give the infamous Burgushi another try. This time I got the taste explosion. It was really quite plain and fell apart as soon as you picked it up since it's just crumbles of burger meat. Pretty disappointing. That said, the milkshakes are AMAZING. I had the No Sleep till Brooklyn which was an espresso and coffee infused alcoholic shake. It was the redeeming item of the evening.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to try Cowfish for awhile now but put that on hold with the norivirus scare and such. Since it's been over a month since they reopened without problems and I got off work a little early yesterday, I was finally able to try them out. (And avoided getting sick lol)  The burger I got was pretty tasty and very large but didn't blow me away overall. I ordered the \"Big Squeal\" which is a burger topped with smoked gouda cheese, BBQ pulled pork, bacon slaw, pickles, lettuce, onion straws, and more BBQ sauce. I ordered my burger medium, and it came out at the correct temp but wasn't super juicy and could've used a little more seasoning. The bun was a little too small for the burger and wasn't that soft; it was definitely lost beneath the big beef patty, especially after soaking up some of the juices and sauce. The BBQ pulled pork didn't have a ton of meat on top of the burger, but the sauce added a ton of flavor, almost overwhelmingly so. The bacon slaw was very vinegary but didn't add much bacon flavor unfortunately. The onion straws added a nice crunch, and the smoked gouda was great on its own but was a little overwhelmed by all the other flavors of the burger. The burger was pretty good overall, but between the BBQ sauce, slaw, and 6-7 pickles it had a strong vinegar taste, which I didn't mind but would be something to look out for. Fair warning: do not order this burger if on a first/second date, it is BIG and it is very, very messy so you may look like a fool eating it. The sweet potato fries I receive on the side were average- solid portion, crispy, and decent tasting but nothing that would blow you away.  My server at the bar was nice, but I was a little surprised that my burger took over 20 minutes to come out once ordering considering it was fairly early and the restaurant wasn't very busy at the time. Overall the food was good but not great, service was pretty solid, and for $14 I got filled up on a huge burger, so just slightly above average for me. This place is a little funky as well with funny posters and fish tanks all around. I think that's the biggest thing going for it- you can get decent quality burgers and (I'm assuming) decent sushi at the same place, which is just a bit funky in itself.",

Once you sit (average time waited for me was at a minimum of 45 minutes) then you will enjoy a great meal with an average service. I think the restaurant should start taking reservations that way everyone can enjoy their meal. Waiting for long it is not a good way to enjoy the great burger this place has to offer.  They have an app which you can use to place your name on the waitlist but the app is only available for Apple iPhone and there is no way to know how long you are going to wait. It is driven by the size of the fish. Really really stupid! And also by doing an app only for Apple, they are automatically excluding other customers to have the opportunity to put the name on the list as they don't take call ahead seating.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g49022-d1995590-r270157933-The_Cowfish_Sushi_Burger_Bar-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html&s=419443502bb2f2797f307f74706e40f0d32f568d9a786acf14d0325a1b84580e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

It takes a long time to get seated on a Saturday night, which is to be expected (1-1.5 hours).

This has become my new favorite place to go when I'm in Charlotte.  I had a blackened Tuna BLT with sweet potato fries and the squid salad as an app along with their Mango Ice tea.  Tuna is sushi grade and was done to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning.  The sauce went very well with the sandwich and there was certainly no skimping on the fish.  I also watched the many different entree's being delivered around me and everything looked great.  They've got lots of great sushi rolls and If your a sushi fan like I am take a look at some of these photos other folks have taken.  It all looks good. Next trip to Charlotte, I know where I'll be dining.",

Also the manager came over and told us that they are expanding with plans to open up some more restaurants in other states and DC.   The crab rangoon dip was very delicious. We tried the ultimate bento box which was a great mix of burger and sushi. We got the boss and tropical storm which were not only pretty but the fish tasted really fresh. We didn't love the taste explosion that much.  At the end of the day, the food was delicious, service was amazing and the concept is unique. People should give it a try.",

I don't remember the name of the martini that I ordered, but it tasted like cucumber and was very delicious and refreshing. The massive sushi roll, aptly named \"Foreplay\" and well worth the money and topped with fried oysters (yumm!), was the most amazing I've ever had. I would not order the fried pickles again. They were bland without any type of seasoning, and served entirely way too hot to eat in large bowl with 2 kinds of house dipping sauces.  Its been a few months since I was there but I'm definitely going back again because the food here is just too outstanding to stay away from.",

Can't wait to visit again! I hear there'll be a second location opening next year...RALEIGH!",

    "text": "Skeptical.  That's the one word I would use to describe my pre-visit thoughts on Cowfish.  I'm so tired of fusion restaurants.  Remember Limp Bizkit and Korn?  They couldn't do one thing well so they decided to go the fusion route and made a shitty mess (along with Creed) of the late-90s music scene.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  Always the cynic, I feel that fusion restaurants take the easy route and mix things together so they don't have to actually be good at something.  To me, fusion and heavy sauces can both be listed under the heading:  How To Cover All Your Cooking Sins.    Cowfish is different.  Cowfish is Led Zeppelin.  Blues/rock.  Burger/sushi.  Cowfish rocks.    I went 100% fish on my visit here, so I'll have to contribute a later review of the burgers.  I used to date a girl who said \"if you're going to be a bear, be a grizzly.\"  Go big or go home.  Ginny and I got our grizzly on and went straight for The Motherload.  This enormous roll showcases every type of fish on the Cowfish menu (as well as a piece of rare roast beef).  The menu touted that \"the presentation will blow you away.\"  They do not tell a lie.  The presentation was beautiful and I will be bold enough to state that Cowfish's fish quality is equal to that of Nikko's.  Prior to eating said roll, we considered ordering the tuna nachos but shied away due to the presence of rangoon sauce on the nachos.  Rangoon is a really fun word to say, but mayonnaise is quite possibly the most foul substance on the face of the earth.  Our thoughts changed, however, when our neighbors to the right ordered the nachos.  Delicious.  I try to avoid listing every last detail of a dish when writing my reviews (leaving me more room to comment on music and my personality shortcomings), so I'll simply say that you should try these nachos when you visit Cowfish.  But between this day and that, say \"rangoon\" as often as possible and thank all that is holy for not having to see Fred Durst on the TV anymore.",

For their burger, I tried the Hunka Hunka Burn'n Love, which was good, but make sure you like sweet before you order this one, because it's super sweet due to the Hawaiian bread, fried banana and peanut butter.   The seaweed salad was good and crunchy, but share it with other people at your table if you expect to finish it off and still have room for your meal.  The sushi rolls have been good each time, except the Yellowtail was VERY hard and low on flavor, totally opposite of all other sushi places in town.",

We were a bit envious of the table next to us though, as their server was very knowledgeable and explained most of the menu to them. We leaned in and listened to what their server was recommending!  We started with the Lobster and crab spring rolls. They were excellent! I love the cilantro pesto and the Thai chili sauce that came with it! My companion ordered the Cowfish Original Burger with a whole wheat bun. Which also gave the option to build your own! There are so many substitutions/ additions to choose from to personalize your burger! The options were limitless! He also got the crispy onion strings as his side dish. They were thinly breaded and crispy, very nice! But too much to finish! They left off the Cowfish sauce and grilled onions, so he was a bit disappointed about that! But still was a pretty good burger.  I ordered a \"burgushi\" which was called The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi BuffalOOOOO-shi Roll! haha! This roll included sauteed chipotle bison, fried green tomato, grilled onions and feta cheese rolled inside, then coated with crispy tempura flakes. The roll is topped with fresh green tomato, chipotle aioli, diced tomato and red onion, and thinly sliced jalapeno pepper. It was very different and excellent! I really loved the it! We had a good experience and would recommend it!",

They are a fusion restaurant but with all the different choice only a few were fusion. I got a burger and it was good however it didn't rest and all the juice from the burger went all over my plate so I couldn't even put it back on the plate otherwise the bun would have been soggy. Luckily I had a side plate for the sushi.   The manager came over to check how everything was. We told him we had just moved to the area. He was nice, chatted with us for while and even offered us a welcome to Charlotte shake. We didn't take him up on the offer as we were too full. It was a very nice gesture however.",

I've also tried a few milkshakes the rice crispy one is my favorite. I've tried the chocolate cake the moose is on the loose and it was just ok... the fried pickles and peppers are my favorite app. I definitely recommend this place.

It did not disappoint. A waiter walked past w the Salmon BLT and fried pickles (I typically would never get fried pickles but so glad I did. The juiciness of the pickles is a lovely balance to the fried batter but not in a slimey way). It was all delish- salmon melts in your mouth. I will be back- again and again and again lol",

The dinner entree choices were Mediterranean Lamb Burger (medium rare) and  Fusion Speciality Bento Box (with Noursin Bacon Burger & Gitecracker Roll). The bento option comes with three sides, and we choose fried sweet potato, pickled Thai cucumber and edamame. Overall, it was a wonder dining experience.

The bento box is also one of the best deals and a great way to try a lot of different things. The parmesan truffle fries and crab rangoon dip are also awesome. My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the All Shook Up milkshake. It's peanut butter, banana, and jelly and it's the best milkshake I've ever had.   The big downside is that it's always packed and you will probably have to wait a while for a table unless you come during off hours.

The fish tank by the bar was quite beautiful as well.   After looking over their expansive menu of you guessed it, burgers and sushi (and more). We decided to try the best of both worlds by ordering a traditional sushi roll and a roll under their \"burgushi.\" Both rolls were phenomenal and the burgushi, also served with a side of fries, was like no sushi we've ever had. Imagine a Big Mac in sushi form. Strange but in the best way possible.   Hands down, Cowfish Sushi Burger is a must try in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Burger or sushi? Why choose? How about some burger-sushi mashup ? During my stay in Charlotte, few people described Cowfish as one of Charlotte's attractions. I was anxious to give it a try.  I ordered the All- AmericanDouble CheeseBurgooShi (without bacon), and I wasn't prepared for a burger and sushi to be combined in this creative and, seemingly, crazy way.  The seasoned all natural beef was wrapped in in soy paper & potato curls like a sushi roll, then topped with ketchup, mustard and dill pickle. Honestly, I'm not sure if I enjoyed it as much as I hoped I would. It was overwhelming. Also, I'm not sure if I'll have it again- cool concept though.  Three Yelps.",

It could have been what i ordered but i loved every bit of it! I had the American Cheeseburgushi roll. Sounds cool right? Well that's because it was. It was actually amazing the whole concept of a hamburger and sushi all smooshed in one a very unique idea and was worth every penny. My friend ordered the prime time lobster roll, when i asked her how did she like hers she said its amazing! Well there you have it. Sums it all up the food here is great and i especially loved my drink it was very refreshing a cucumber martini which on the drink menu its called cucumber tini. Something tells me all of the drinks here are probly pretty darn good.",

    "text": "One word to describe this place, \"BURGUSHI\"!  Such a crazy cool concept of a mixing a sushi place with a gourmet burger spot.   This is one of my favorite places to take friends when they come in town to visit.  For first timers I definitely recommend going for one of the bento boxes.  You get the best of both worlds with the slider of the week and a few pieces of a specialty roll. If you're feeling adventurous you can just jump straight to the burgushi which is where they use ingredients that would normally make a burger and turn it into a delicious sushi roll!  The only downside to this place is that it can sometimes be tough to get a table.  Which is just a testament to how good the food is!!  Tip: Half price martinis on Tuesdays!!! #YoureWelcome",

    "text": "Do you ever have a craving for a burger but also want sushi?? Well if you do this is the place to be! We came on a Sunday around 12pm and it was poppin! The lady at the front said it'd be a 15 minute wait but had a table ready in 5 minutes.   We were sat near the door, so a little chilly (because it was in the 30s that day) but would be a perfect spot in the spring/summer time! The waiter was so friendly and patient with us. The menu has so many choices that it took us a little longer to decide! I wanted sushi but the burger of the week had bacon and it sounded delicious (It started with a B I'm sorry I can't remember the name of it!!). I wanted the lobster sushi roll but decided to go with the bento box. I was hesitant with getting it because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough food and the sushi I wanted wasn't one of the ones to choose from (although I'm sure you'd be able to get the sushi you wanted but I didn't ask!! Ask away if you want a different kind!!).   THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD IN THE BENTO BOX!!! Goodness I was surprised. Sweet potato fries were delicious, fried pickles were tasty, and the edamame was different but I liked it. I got the sushi with an avocado topping. The sushi was good but I wasn't the biggest fan of the avocado stuff and I like avocados. The burger was juicy and seasoned very well. Overall, if you can't choose one thing, trust me you will be happy with the bento box!! Oh and I almost forgot, we got the garlic truffle fries. Do yourself a favor and get the garlic truffle fries!! They were so amazing!   Finally, the waiter was super nice. Again, I can't believe I forgot his name, but I believe it was Joshua? He was great and made our visit enjoyable!! This place is worth a try if you are in the area or looking for a new place to try!!",

I blame it on 1) the lack of similar options across Charlotte and 2) the vast number of trendy yuppies and consultants out and about on any given week night. If you have to wait more than 15-20 min, I don't think it's worth your time (but that's how I feel about any restaurant).   If you DO manage to snag a table, Cowfish is great! Their punny decor cracks me up, and the food is pretty good. I end up going with a bento box almost every time, because there are just so many options on the menu that I have trouble making a decision. At least the bento box includes a few options in one. Plus, the edamame & sweet potato fries are super addicting.",

An overall decent app, but I think there are others on the menu that would outshine ((side note: I LOVE crab rangoon - I will order them 9/10 times when on the menu). The slightly more expensive bento box is the way to go - the slider of the week was awesome, the sweet potato fries are delicious, the cucumbers have a little zing, the sushi was decent, and those were some of the best fried pickles I've had! I also tried the vanilla chai tea - very flavorful, and I love how they serve it! I will definitely be back!",

There's something novel about eating a slider and sushi during the same meal, but it works...even though you can order just a burger or just sushi, I usually end up getting the bento combo that includes both, along with a salad, edamame, and sweet potato fries...a ton of food that I never end up finishing. I like the cheeky sayings on their chopsticks, and with their fun colorful decor.  Sure, it's not the most authentic sushi, but their fish is fresh, and their food is well made and tasty.

If you've never been I recommend getting the app and saving your spot in like then go venture around the mall if you're going to go around a busy time but I've been during lunch time or other non busy times and I was instantly seated.

Busy place for later on a weeknight, and well sat to keep the vibe high even as the restaurant emptied out a bit. Good atmosphere, loud but not overbearing, lots of energy. Service was super nice, but disappeared at different times. It's nice to have some privacy when eating, but we sat with empty plates for a long time, and it took quite a while to get the check and pay. Food was good, but not great. My burger was undercooked, closer to rare than to medium. Well seasoned though, and the bacon was excellent. We had one of the Cheeseburgooshi rolls, kind of cool though more of a gimmick than an excellent dish.  Not great flavor, but just a regular burger in sushi roll clothes. We also got a normal salmon based roll, which was fine. The sushi seemed fresh enough, and well put together - no complaints there. Came with an aioli, which was an interesting add to sushi, but pretty good. Overall, good vibes, come here to enjoy your self and try the unique concept.",

The only small ding I would give was the music was a little loud that resulted in people talking loud over it. I asked if they could turn it down some and they were very happy to. Once it was turned down you could carry on a conversation. I will be back and will recommend to friends. Put this place on your must try and be willing to experiment with your sushi!!",

So, I can easily see that if you're just a sorta sushi fan, then you're going to love Cowfish because you can throw it in your sushi-eating friends' faces and say you eat sushi, too!  Burger sushi!  It is a very fun atmosphere.  The waitstaff is very friendly.  Good music.  Even a cute graphic display to show your wait for your table (look for the big video monitor showing the swimming fish).  They even use your cell phone to text you.  As a beef eater, I'd say the food is pretty good.  It's not Ruth Chris, but it's a fusion between beef and sushi, so I did try the Taste Temptation, which is beef, tomatoes and rice, and found it decent.  Of all the things I had, they did have a really good crab and lobster shrimp roll for an appetizer.  Quite big and very tasty.  Also, had a great wine selection, definitely one of those more than full bar places.",

Items we suggest as a family (some collectively & others individually ): Lamb burger - Medium Well Firecracker Salmon & Blue Crab rolls Lump crabcake with Fried Green Tomatos Classic CowFish Beef Burger Salmon Salad Calamari Several of the specialty rolls - Too many to list & quite honestly I don't know all the names I just do INI - MINI - MyNee - MO  Great restaurant with great service!!",

They know what IS and IS NOT gf and their menu is pretty clear. Any questions and they ask the chef.   We got burgers and make your own sushi. The food was amazing and the service was excellent!

The most memorable one was when we brought our out-of-town guests for dinner. We wanted to take them to a fun place with high energy and that would stand out from any other restaurant...and boy were we right!  Our guests loved the variety and the fun, yet strange options of hamburgers and fish in the same menu. They were also impressed with the language lesson in the bathroom and the touch screens at the bar.   We ordered 5 sushi rolls to share. We had a slight issue with one of the rolls and immediately our server and owner took ownership and made sure that the one hiccup didn't ruin the rest of our dining experience. In fact, the excellent service made the night even more impressive...our guests were shocked at how caring the service was! By the way, they make their roll slices pretty big...if you want more bite-sizeable, ask for them to cut it into more pieces.  You have to make sure to get a spiked milkshake for dessert...the chocolate one (can't remember the name) was by far the best one! Yummy!!  If you want to impress your guests, Cowfish is the way to go.",

Waited at the bar for our table, per usual decent wait procedure, and took forever to get anything. We had 6 people in our group this visit, and 3 bartenders were in front of us, very busy. But not even a \"hello, I'll be right with you\" occurred.   Once seated, I think the waitress we had was new, or at least I hope she was, because getting the right utensils and sushi dishes was a struggle.   Another thing is, the menu has not changed much either as of late, which I thought was part of their concept. Of course they have some home runs on urge menu that shouldn't be touched, but I was expecting some new things.   I will be back and hope for better service and maybe try something new!",

The service was top notch, granted we did go in before the dinner rush but still the service was amazing.  For appetizer's we ordered the Tuna Poke appetizer. It was really good a bit too salty but really good otherwise. We also got the Lobster Egg rolls, let me tell you Amazing in a word, Absolutely amazing.  Flavorful not greasy, real lobster definitely worth getting.  My friend got A jalapeno burger it looked great.  I ventured out and got the Prime Time Roll, lobster and prime rib  on the Burgushi roll.  Was very good, not quite as good as the Taste of Explosion roll but still good.  My friend got the Godiva kiss spiked shake and it looked awesome, and I got the Banana vodka split shake, it was good but a lot of vodka in it.    overall please go here, they are amazing and service, food and quality always on top of it!",

The first time I made my own sushi, which was alright, because I really know nothing about making my own sushi. The next time I had the bento box with California Roll, which was really good. The sides of thai cucumbers and sweet potato fries were delicious, as was the mini burger. My boyfriend had the Jalapeno Popper Show-Stopper, which he enjoyed a lot. The next time we were there he ordered The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi BuffalOOOOO-shi Roll, which has bison meat in it and he loved that too. I had the Heavenly Veggie burger which was delicious. So all-in-all, I love this place and think it's a great place to have in the Queen City.  Although if you are going here on weekends, make sure to call ahead since they have long waits.",

Three different kinds of tuna and two different varieties of hamachi made me very, very happy. Then apple wontons for dessert just to keep the smile on my face.

It took a WHILE to get an order in, couldn't get my check in a timely manner, didn't get my tea refilled....this actually became pretty amusing, then frustrating. It was after traditional lunch hour. (I arrived about 1:40 pm, and the efforts of the employees present were spent on doing everything except looking after me.)  Ordered the lunch special bento box w/burger, which also took a while to receive. HOWEVER, it was really, really good.  So, my experience: Kitchen - \"good\" -- Service - \"Lacking\" -- Cleanliness - \"good\" as I witnessed a LOT of cleaning going on around me, and not-so-much attention to getting me in and out at lunch time.  I will go back when I have lots of time for lunch, and will revise this review if I experience better service next time.",

The food is delicious and very creative. I usually try to get something new off the menu when I come since there are so many options and everything I've had so far has been delicious. The restaurant is always busy and has a really cool/live vibe inside. It can get loud with the music and all the people, but it sets for a fun environment. I would highly recommend this place if you're in Charlotte.  Food Rating: 5/5 Service Rating: 4/5 Ambiance Rating: 4.5/5",

Aside from the burgers, the highlight for me was the Taste Explosion roll.  It is extremely unique and lives up to its name.  The downside is that this place is normally very crowded, so your wait is long and they will cram you in like sardines.  To avoid eating dinner with complete strangers, I would recommend asking to sit out back on the patio.  The great food (and options) here is worth coming back despite the crowd.",

There are sometimes open seats at the bar you can jump in for quicker service.  When you're done you can walk over to Cheesecake Factory for dessert.",

We were fortunate enough to try a number of the \"sushi\" dishes when they were testing them out at Eez in Huntersville.  My wife and I finally made the trip in to town to try it out first hand and we were amazed.  We tried a couple different things and couldn't find any flaws with anything.  The only downside is that you should be prepared to wait or try to hit it at the right time.  We lucked out and got a couple spots at the bar after 10-15 minutes.  The wait for a table was pushing 2 hours.",

    "text": "I love the concept of combining the offerings of sushi and burgers (unique!) and also coming up with creative 'fusion' dishes to blend the two. The menu is extensive and has tons of different categories of options. The sushi is mostly tempura stuff, the focus is not on fresh raw fish. And, after taking my chances on midwest/non-coastal area sushi and living in the bay area for a bit, I've become somewhat of a sushi snob unfortunately. SO decided to go for their bison burger (sans buns, it is gluten free!) They also had tons of other great looking beef burgers, a lamb burger, etc. I love that their meat is antibiotic/hormone free.   The bartender who took my takeout order was super friendly and checked with the chef to make sure the meat wasn't seasoned with any gluten, etc. which I really appreciated. I got it with pesto and avocado, and got the cucumber salad on the side. The portion is great, the burger was delightful - perfectly cooked and SO tasty! Would definitely come back here.   Note: the hostess (or whoever picked up the phone that night when I called at first) was really unpleasant. I asked about gluten in their bison burger, pesto, etc. and she kept waving me off saying \"I don't think so, I'm sure it's fine.\" That is NOT what a gluten intolerant person who gets very ill from eating gluten wants to hear!! Finally, after sounding annoyed, she said she'd go ask someone, and then promptly hung up on me. Ruuuuude.",

Our waitress was great we told her it was our first time and she literally went through the entire menu... I was a bit hesitant to stop her b/c I could have just read the menu but she was in a groove so we let her continue.   I asked for the Mango Iced Tea. The description made it sound delicious but she did warn me that it's not \"sweet\" tea lol...  she recommended that if I like Mango to try the Mango martini (I'm sure it has another name but that's the gist of it) so I ordered one  of those while my friend ordered a beer.   I thought this place was a good balance between sushi and burgers seeing that my friend isn't a big fan of sushi and I was on the fence with the burgers. I decided on a Burgersushi entree! I had the Mary Had A Little Lamb roll .... The description sold me lamb, feta, olives, capers cucumbers all rolled up into a delicious \"sushi\" roll! WIN WIN WIN  I do admit the presentation could have been a little better but overall the roll was very yummy!  I will be trying this place again , I would like to try the regular sushi as well as the bento box which was a combo of sushi and a mini burger !",

    "text": "Incredible place! This has got to be the largest sushi restaurant I have ever been too - so many creative rolls & dishes. And it's not just sushi! Burgers and burgers they refer to as \"Burgushi\" which is a fusion of a burger and a sushi roll. I can't even begin to capture the essence of this place, other than the sushi bar surrounds the entire interior of the restaurant with a large freshwater tank as the focal point.  Since I don't want to demolish the uniqueness of what they do here is a snip-it from their website:  \"The Cowfish brings to the world the first restaurant focusing on offering both the best sushi AND the best burger in town. Fresh, innovative and delicious, the sushi segment of the menu is a unique balance of traditional and unconventional. All natural, creative and hearty, the burgers entice with fresh ingredients and bold flavors. Spiked hand-spun milkshakes, premium sakes, craft beers, wine and 10oz exotic martinis round out a huge bar menu that is sure to please. The Cowfish aims to offer something for the entire family. Scrumptious appetizers for sharing, entree-sized salads, homemade desserts and a fun kid's menu are joined by our signature creations that we call \"Burgushi\"! A cutting edge fusion of burger and sushi, burgushi items include sushi rolls created using burger components, and pick-up style sandwiches created using sushi components. If you can't make up your mind, try a bento box to sample a mini-burger along with your choice of sushi roll and three tasty side items!\"  I had my regular yellowtail sashimi, then a very creative & tasty roll and I absolutely could not pass up the chocolate cake shake... and I'm so glad I didn't.  This is right down the road from me so I plan on becoming a regular!",

    "text": "While spending a week in Charlotte for work stuff, and after yelping sushi in the area, we decided on Cowfish. The place was super packed for a weekday evening and the wait times were long if you wanted a table (if you sit at the bar you can get a seat in a few minutes).  Their menu is ridiculously huge (and not just in physical size).  There are so many things to choose from-- Sushi- check! Burgers- check! Burger sushi rolls-- check! Sushi burgers- check!  You'll need about ten minutes to read through the menu and ten more to try and figure out why \"burgushi\" sounds so good. I ended up ordering/splitting a few of their fusion sushi (\"burgushi\") rolls and a few more traditional rolls. The rolls are pretty big and I was quickly full.   The restaurant started to slow down around 9:00pm (not as many families hanging out) and the bartender was able to slow down as well and chat and make suggestions of things to do and see in the area. As well as talk about his favorites on the menu.   If you're in Charlotte, give this place a try.  They have something for everyone, the staff is great, and the decor is really entertaining and cheeky.  And while \"burgushi\" may sound really weird... It totally works.",

    "text": "How many places do you know that serve sushi, burgers and burgushi (combine them both) in one restaurant? Exactly, none...for that reason Cowfish deserves a 5-star review. They back it up with their great food, menu and service. Been here at least 10 times and it's safe to say I've tried a lot of menu items. I usually sit at the bar because there's always a wait when I get there. Bartenders are knowledgeable and quick with their service.   As for the menu. The sushi is really good. Not as good as some specialty sushi restaurants around town, but the rolls are unique and large. Recommendation...ask the rolls to be cut in 10 pieces vs. 8 so they are more manageable. The burgers are really good. This is my favorite part of the place. The Green Monster burger has avocado, pepparjack and jalapenos on it! They're also at least 1/2 pound...big! Choice of sides are abundant, but sweet potato fries are usually the norm. On a recent visit I went with the Ahi Tuna burger, which was very tasty and had a nice Asian slaw on it.   But for something unique and light, go with the bento box...definiately for lunch. Comes with 5 sections. Small (4 piece) roll of your choice (think there's 3-4 options), a mini burger of the day, sweet potato fries, edamame and cucumber salad. A little bit of everything for those that can't decide because the menu is so BIG.   My only two complaints are 1)the menu itself, as it's so big. Everything Ive had on it has been good, don't get me wrong...you just need a solid 5-10 minutes to look it over, hence the reason for multiple visits and 2) PBR tallboys are $5. From one who loves PBR, this is just a laughable price. I look forward to enjoying the large patio when the weather is warmer. This is the new hot spot of the Southpark area and it's well deserved.",

They told me about Cowfish and how good their sushi was as well as their burgers and milkshakes.  Granted it was a Friday evening, and it did not seem to be overly crowded, so I was not expecitng a 90 minute wait.  But it gave my friends and I a chance to sit and catch up as we waited.",

    "text": "Put simply, it may be the case that the Cowfish is overrated. Located next to the shopping mall underneath an apartment building (I do not want to be associated with people who live in apartments basically on top of a mall. Ick.), the Cowfish restaurant seems wildly popular. It has nearly 500 reviews in the solid red-orange range of four stars. My wife and I couldn't get a table at 4:30 on Jan. 1, so we sat at the bar.  Here you can get sushi, or burgers, or a combo of both. I guess this means your health nut friends and your obese unhealthy friends can all get together in one restaurant! For that, Cowfish, many kudos. In fact, more restaurants should be heading in this direction. And for that, you deserve four stars. Below is why I knocked it down a notch.  Step inside the bathroom and you hear automated recordings of a man and a woman taking on a faux North Carolina hick, redneck accent and spewing off a number of homespun axioms. I wish I could remember a few, but they were things like, \"Don't pee on my back and call it rain!\" and they were repeated ad nauseam. It was truly difficult to bear. The next reason Cowfish drops a notch is simply due to its service. It took forever to get a food order, and when we did, the food arrived fairly quickly. I ordered some edamame and sushi. The edamame was good, and not too salty. The sushi was also good: spicy tuna and vegetarian rolls. They were wrapped pretty well, you got a good piece of fish in there, and it tasted fresh.  On the walls are the paintings that are humorous take-offs on famous paintings or art. Some seem mildly offensive or distasteful. One of them is an Asian Mona Lisa. What? Another is a rendering of Picasso's Guernica, which depicts the German bombing of a Basque region during the Spanish Civil War. It's a pretty gut-wrenching painting of a solemn topic. But in the Cowfish's rendering, all the character, people suffering and fleeing from a Nazi bombing, are COWS. It's just not in good taste. Granted, some of the painting are actually funny.  To top it of, after I paid, my server started awkwardly joking with me as I fiddled with my phone. \"I know you want to dance,\" he quipped to the loud pop music pumping in the background. It's okay. Go ahead and dance.\" Where was all this attention when I wanted to order a meal? I managed a polite, if feeble, grin, and got the heck outta there.",

The staff were nice even though we came without a reservation, and kept adding people to our table.  The menus are huge. I had trouble looking at one without knocking anything over on the table. Also, I'm short, and we were at a high table, so that could be part of the issue. The dishes also have some annoying names. \"Screamin' Korean Chicken?\" Really?  The food is fine, but it is definitely fusion. Don't look for authentic here! I had the hamachi (yellowtail) topped with a slice of jalapeno and ponzu sauce, plus a roll. The roll was fine. It was all fine. Just not memorable. The atmosphere and the crazy menu were more memorable.  But I'd go back. It's fun, and the quality is fine.",

The appetizers were briskly brought to the table, and after a brief appreciation of the presentation, consumed in  a similar fashion. I would return to this establishment.",

Red makes people excited and hungry. I like the mind games you play on me Cowfish.  3) They offer Bento boxes for a reasonable price. Don't know if you want a burger or sushi and not completely cold on the burgushi idea? Get the Bento! Comes with the burger of the week, choice of limited selection of sushi rolls, edamame, sweet potato fries and cucumber salad  4) Fabu drink specials. All sake is half off on Thursdays---including the sake sample which was only $6 for five varieties.  5) They put goat cheese on their burgers. Goat cheese = love.  6) Interesting sushi combinations that will please any sushi lover out there  7) Two words-spiked shakes  8) Getting a spiked shake for free when they made one too many  9) Sign up for their email list and you get a free appetizer coupon along with other special offers  10) The vibe and the artwork....modern/pop culture/comic   I went to Cowfish for their soft opening and tonight was my first visit back since then. I love the Cowfish since I am a fan of the sushi however this is not a place I would go all the time for sushi. It's a bit pricey for my liking but if you want a nice meal in a hip atmosphere, this is the place for you. Be sure to make reservations--I went tonight and thank God we had a reservation--we heard that the wait was two hours.....on a Thursday night....in Charlotte. They are obviously doing something right.",

From the Warhol inspired Godzilla painting to the burger \"king\" who I always found creepy; the decor is contemporary, atmosphere is live, and service is fabulous. Our waiter, Walter is a master of his trade.   Prices are surprisingly affordable and if the name wasn't a dead give away - yep this place also has an eclectic menu. From the Burger bento box, to filet oscar roll to the Arnold Hamandegger burgah. It's all good in the hood. Fish is fresh with some traditional, some make your own and the ever so present specialty rolls.   One point I must touch on is when the server brought out our food, she asked if we wanted anything else? I happily obliged and she had no qualms when I put in an order with her rather then our waiter.   When we let our waiter know it was our first visit , he had the manager come out to introduce himself, greet us, and offered a free appetizer for the next visit.   He was either:   1. Very personable, takes pride in the business, and delivering a great experience  or   2. Recognized my pretty lil' face from Yelp and wanted to bribe me ;)  Before you leave, make sure you make a stop to the bano. Just as the crazy name implies, you will hear an even crazier recording of a phrase in English, then translated in redneck and lastly translated in Japanese.",

It it were, I'd give it 5 stars.    Ironically, the burgers are fantastic!  If you're looking for a great dinner place with an urban NY type atmosphere to take your spouse or date, go for it.  But if you have clients who you want to impress with premium quality sushi, go elsewhere.  BTW I really haven't found a place in Charlotte that fits the bill.  I'm from Los Angles and Seattle, you just can't beat the sushi restaurants there.  Bottom line, the rolls, burgers and the fusion stuff is all great, but you'll be disappointed if you want premium sashimi.  I'm dined here about 6 times now and each time tried various type of sashimi as well as other items.  It's constantly good, but again, it's not premium grade sushi/sashimi.",

Everything was great EXCEPT the martinis were WEAK especially for $12 drinks!   The burgers were amazing and the sushi combos were good too. (If you like gyros try the \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" sushi rolls.) The kids menu was also surprisingly well rounded and had plenty for picky eaters.

The crowd does tend to build the closer to the lunch and dinner hours that you get, but if you arrive say an hour earlier than that, you are sure to get the stool or booth of your choice.  The sushi is superb and of the highest grade.  The only con I have is that their individual portions are a bit on the large side, and those of you who don't want to stuff your face with every bite may want to either cut them, or perhaps just ask for smaller pieces.  Either way, this is one of my favorite places in the area!",

BUT, Cowfish does bring together two of my favorite foods - sushi and burgers and does them both surprisingly well!  Since I've only snacked on hubs' burger, I'll focus my review on apps and sushi. Let's get to it...  1) The scene: Super cool looking restaurant - very pop art-ish with custom sushi/Warhol esque paintings scattered on the red walls. Also, a huge bar and overall big concept (they took the Counter's space & the old Grape space - this place is magnanimous). Tons of tables in the bar area and general dining space. Make a reservation - it shall save you time!   2) The staff: Sharp, knowledgeable and friendly on both accounts I've sat down for a meal here. They are able to walk you through the gigantic menu and help you focus on a few things that catch your eye.   3) The menu: Huge. I mean Cheesecake Factory huge. Almost bordering on so large and detailed you can't take it all in. Think apps, burgers, burgushi, traditional sushi, creative sushi, make your own sushi, milkshakes, desserts, oh my.   4) The food: De-freakin'-licious. A few things I've really enjoyed here... -Crab Rangoon dip: Just as you would imagine, but better. Not for the dieting kind: fried wonton crisps, drizzled with sauce and dunkable in the crabby rangoony dip. Yes, please. -Tropical Storm Roll: super fresh, delicious and huge. *Word to the wise, if you want to actually fit a piece of a sushi roll in your mouth, ask them to cut the rolls into 10 pieces instead of 8. Trust me...your jaw will thank me. -Mango Tango Roll: Yummmm. I love just about anything with mango and this creative mixture is delightful. Plus - jalapeno! Nom. -Fried pickles: Tasty and crunchy with a delicious dipping sauce.  -White Diamond: Normally I shy away from panko, flash fried rolls but this is pretty flavorful! I may ask for a bit more heat next time, too.   5) The prices: Honestly, pretty reasonable prices considering how much food you get to indulge in! Plus, the.sushi.rolls.are.huge. And the apps are pretty generous in size. Sharing is caring...share a few rolls with friends, you'll have plenty of food to go around.   I also noticed that their lunch menu looks pretty slammin' and reasonable! So that's my long winded review of Cowfish. I really adore this chic fusion eatery and can't wait to go back!",

I ended up getting the veggie burger and couldn't have been happier with it. The patty is made in-house and it's topped with spinach, onions, roasted red peppers, and avocado. Yum! My boyfriend got a chicken burger and he said it was delicious as well.   The ONLY thing I could complain about were the fries. They have thin \"shoe-string\" fries that just aren't as satisfying as thick fries. But maybe that's just me.   In any case, the food and service was fantastic! If we didn't live so far away, we would definitely come back again!",

My meal: -Started off with a glass of the Cowfish Cabernet. I didn't feel like it had enough body, so I upgraded to the most expensive Cabernet option which I was very happy with.  -For appetizers I shared the Spicy Poke Dip and the Seared Sesame Tuna. For someone unaware what poke is, it is not a dip. This means it was diced spicy salmon and tuna over a bed of seaweed salad. The presentation of the Seared Sesame Tuna was lovely and I loved how it also included seaweed salad! -I then shared the Spider Crab roll (non-raw option) and the Pinky Swear roll (fushion roll). The Spider Crab roll was okay, but the Pinky Swear was great! Will definitely be back to try the Burgushi!",

Highly recommend getting the bento box! The Sushi is really good, you probably should get two rolls. The milkshakes were a perfect touch! 10/10 recommend this place!

Not only was the food amazing, but everyone down to the man who sat us we're 10 out of 10. It was like each table, was the only table there. Such great service!!!! Our server Jamie, was absolutely amazing and took such good care of us! The manager (who is a Dolphins fan, I cant remember his name) came and spoke with us multiple times, like we we're old friends. This Cowfish is doing something right, that restaurants need to try and be like. I walked out and said I had to make sure I reviewed this place just to make sure they knew how great they were, and how we will be back every time we are in Charlotte. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I don't know why, but Cowfish always pops up in my head for a place to take my friends/family from out of town to. And, they all liked or loved it!   Place - trendy, hip, fun, and casual. On a busy night, which seems busy every single time, it gets loud. Be aware though, the wait is long after 6pm when they do not take reservations.    Service - good to great. I have had great service, but then I have had good. Overall, they get you what you need in a timely manner.  Food - they have something for sushi and non-sushi lovers. So you have your burgers (which I am a fan of of Swiss burgers) and shakes (love love LOVE orange dreamsicle). I like their sushi specials, like their Mad-Mango-cado Roll that has shrimp tempura and avocado is alright (had better). When I first stumbled upon here, I would get the 'Cowfish bento box' - mini-burger with 4 piece of sushi rolls, in addition to the sides of edamame, fries, and Thai cucumbers.  I like the atmosphere and the cheap sake bombs. I would get sushi from another place though....",

However, beware they have stopped taking same day reservations and even on a Tuesday night there was an hour plus wait.  When I called they did let me do a call ahead seating so our actual wait on site was reasonable.    We started with the crab and lobster spring rolls which were presented vertically, pinned together at the bottom with nice sauces. The portions was HUGE.   Next we ate the \"Motherload\", a plate that included 2 of every fish in the Resturant! Yumm.  The firecracker roll was also huge and very fresh and tasty. We had a couple other specialty rolls and left the place begging for mercy as we were stuffed.    Oh yes, and Tuesdays \"fancy\" martinis are 1/2 price... The bill was $89 for dinner fans drinks for two tall guys.  Go enjoy this please. It's great.  Last time there we tried a burger slider plate as an app and it stood out with terrific favors.",

The first thing I noticed was the decor; funky and satirical. It wasn't loud but it wasn't quiet, somewhere in between.  Our server was Brian. He was great! We had never been to Cowfish before and he took the time to explain the menu and provide us with a few recommendations. Their menu is extensive; from vegan and gluten free options to create-your-own sushi rolls.  We started off with signature cocktails; Skinny Gonzales, Moscow Muleshine, and Buleits & Bacon. Wow! They were delicious and strong. For our entrees, we had The Big Squeal (burger), The Miss Moffitt (sushi), and the Mark's Roll (sushi). All of us had a bite from each meal and the reaction was the same....Oh.My.God. Everything was delicious, every bite bursting with flavor.   We will definitely be going back!",

They also have something called the Angry Lobster. LOVED IT! I'm not sure if they only have it on the menu several times a year or not. I just know that it was on there that time, and the next time we visited, I saw that they brought it back on their Instagram, so we were there!  Their sliders are AMAZING! They make you want a platter of them.",

    "text": "The food was great and our waiter was terrific; however, it took over an hour for our food to be served after the order was taken. The table behind us also had a long wait and, when they started complaining, two different managers came out separately and fawned all over them but not a word was said to us - I guess the squeaky wheel really does get the grease.  Our waiter, Matt, kept our glasses full, made sure that we knew that he was monitoring the kitchen for our order and arranged to have our appetizer comped. The delay wasn't his fault so his tip wasn't affected by it all.  Overall we will probably give this place another try because of the food quality and Matt's service.",

Our waiter, Adam, was in a hurry and tried to stack every single plate from our table of three. Not only did he drop the plates onto the table, into my lap and onto the floor, but the soy sauce covered my entire lap down to my feet. He acted like it was no big deal and didn't even apologize. We rushed to get paper towels and napkins to clean everything up, including the mess on the floor. He then brought us our check and we mutually decided we were not going to give him a tip - He didn't help clean up and never once said sorry, even though I was covered with food and soy sauce down to my shoes. After we paid, said thank you, and walked out of the door, he chased us out of the restaurant yelling at us until we got in our car! We certainly NEVER expected this treatment from a restaurant of this caliber! We will absolutely never be back.",

Holy Batman! I'm a fan of Cowfish again!! I came here a few years ago. The food was okay....   I recently came back with the Yelp Elite squad. Then for dinner and drinks with a friend, the food and service was AMAZING! You can't go wrong with the Lobster and crab egg rolls!!! The added sauce is to die for!! I've also tried the wonton dip, which I hate sharing!   I wouldn't recommend coming Thurs-Sat, it's busy during dinner (hardly any tables available). Which isn't a bad thing!

The menu is a little overwhelming with so many options, but our hostess helped to guide us to a few highlights. We ended up ordering: two burgers (The Texas Longhorn and the Arnold Hamandeggar - both were SO delicious and the portion sizes, generous - a half pound burger to be exact!), a burgushi (The All American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi - which was also yummy, but the flavors are more Asian than American), and a bento box (The Fusion Specialty Bento Box with the Firecracker roll - This is a great way to sample some of the sides. I loved the firecracker roll but you don't get to fully experience their REAL specialty with the bento box - their BURGERS). Their sides are close to perfect (Get their classic fries or sweet potato fries, or for lighter fare, try their edamame and grilled vegetables with their amazing burgers).  The service was excellent - our waitress was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The interior is casual and playful with bold colors and witty posters.  We loved this place first and foremost for their delicious burgers. Can't wait to come back during our next visit to Charlotte!",

    "text": "It's been.. Wow, 7 months since I wrote a review?    My wife and I moved to Charlotte in January and we have been told by our new friends here that we MUST GO to The Cowfish at some point.  Looking for something to do for our anniversary tonight we decided now would be a great time.  Burgers? Sushi? Both at the same time?  We were intrigued.  This is a really cool spot.  The staff is very fast and friendly and the decor is unique.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and while the Southpark area is gorgeous, we opted to sit inside.  We started with the parmesan truffle fries and they were INCREDIBLE.  Bacon, cheese, the usual suspects.  The fries were shoestring style and there was just enough topping not to make them soggy.  For dinner I had the \"All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi.\"  So basically it's Angus hamburger meat, cheese, ketchup, mustard and your typical burger fixings inside of a soybean sushi sheet and then flash fried.  So it's presented like sushi but when you eat it, it tastes like a cheeseburger.  The disconnection between the visual and tasting the food really messes with your head.  It was delicious though!  My wife had a \"build your own\" turkey burger and fried pickles.  This is where the staff at Cowfish really stepped up.  My wife doesn't eat beef.  Not for any ideological reasons she just doesn't care for it.  When our food arrived my wife received a very, VERY rare beef burger instead of her turkey burger.  We're not ones to make a scene.  We know working in food is a tough job, so she politely informed the waitress of this.  She apologized and the right food arrived promptly.  No worries!  A few minutes later the manager came out and asked what happened.  We explained and he apologized once more, comped her meal and said dessert was on him tonight.  The apology and replacing the food was sufficient enough, but it was really above and beyond for him to do the rest of it.  I only regret I forgot the manager's name because that was top class stuff.  We finished with \"The Mousse is Loose\" which I thought was going to be a glass of chocolate mousse.  Instead we got this giant slab of two brownies with chocolate and vanilla mousse on top.  It was UNREAL.  It's everything you want in a chocolate dessert.  The Cowfish is awesome.  Great food and service.  We will be back as often as we can.",

At 4:30 I arrived to the restaurant to pick up and the bar tender was entering the order into the kitchen as I arrived. He was very kind, but let me know it would be at least 20 minutes for my burgers to be ready. Unfortunately I couldn't wait another 20 minutes for my food so I asked them to cancel the order, and was told I'd get a refund of my money.  Almost 2 weeks and multiple phone calls later, I still haven't seen my $50.  It's unfortunate because we love cowfish! I've been coming here for 6 years, maybe longer. We've heard they're having some problems right now and it's impacting customers waiters etc, but this is terrible customer service.  I probably won't be returning here, despite them having good food, because it's not worth the headache. I'm a graduate student so missing $50 is a big inconvenience for me.",

This is what I think makes them unique in their sushi / burger fusion.  I have eaten here a numebr of times and I still yet to think I have ever had a bad meal. Their tribute to Ric Flair (The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-SHI BUFFALOOOOO-SHI Roll) is probably my favorite of the Burgerushi, and what I will have friends try to get an idea of what Cowfish is about. If you want a tasty shake, then you can't go wrong with the s'mores. In short, so many great things to try on the menu, I always find something new to go after whenever I am back in town.",

One of the bartenders literally washed his face at the sink in front of us and then began to handle limes, drinks, food etc. The two male bartenders had the worst attitudes. It made our dinner experience awful.  To top it off, the sushi was terrible!",

I had the dynamite roll in my bento box and it was the best thing I had. I was VERY excited about the burger of the week with goat cheese but it was a little dry and underwhelming.

    "text": "Every single time I've been to The Cowfish it's been a wonderful meal and a wonderful evening, but tonight was something special.   A few months back my best friend Chris and I were lucky enough to be part of a Yelp Event at Southpark Mall that included a visit to The Cowfish. It's an absolute favorite of ours and through talking with the managers organizing the event we were offered the opportunity to be some of the first to eat the Gobble Gobbleooshi this year. Any chance to eat some delicious food is a welcome one so we settled on tonight, gathered our significant others and the four of us headed out.   We arrive around 6:30pm and are quickly seated. Our awesome waiter Leon welcomed us and quickly got our drink orders. The manager Anthony stopped by and mentioned that head chef Rifali was going to come by to say hello before our meal. Sure enough, master sushi chef Rifali Almunir comes out and welcomes us and says he wants us to try a special sushi dish before our meal. He comes back a few minutes later holding a beautiful plate with two small bamboo dishes garnished with edible flowers. He explains this is a special hamachi (yellowtail) tasting dish. Alternating pieces of fresh cut fish  and marinated orange slices served with a wasabi yuzu sauce. Now I'm really not a sushi person, I just don't appreciate raw fish as much as others. Aside from specials like the Gobbleooshi I normally get a burger when I go to The Cowfish, but this was pretty good. Super light and sweet, the more refined sushi palletes at the table said it was some of the best they had ever had. We thanked him for the special treat and told us he would be back with the main course.   It was finally Gobble Gobble time!  If you've never heard of it the Gobbleooshi is a seasonal specialty of The Cowfish only available in November. Its essentially an entire thanksgiving dinner disguised in the form of a sushi roll. Turkey and green beans in the center, stuffing instead of rice, flash fried sweet potato straws on the outside instead of a seaweed wrap with gravy and cranberry sauce on the plate and each piece topped with a fried green bean. Savory with a touch of sweet. Soft inside and crunchy outside. Its unique and odd and wonderful. We split two of the big rolls between the four of us and our plates were left clean. Delicious.  Just when we thought things couldn't get any better Leon came back a few other waiters and a massive piece of \"The Moose is Loose.\" At The Cowfish you get a free dessert on your birthday where everyone comes out and does a silly song, but it's my wife and mines first wedding anniversary tomorrow so I suppose they thought it was a similarly worthy event. I believe I mentioned it in my previous review but The Moose is essentially a massive piece of cake with alternating layers of chocolate cake, chocolate mousse and whipped cream mousse and its absolutely amazing. The perfect way to end a meal.   The more I think about it the more I think The Cowfish truly is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte. The staff are always on point, the food is always delicious and I always leave happy. Thank you to Leon, Andrew and Chef Rifali for a wonderful evening and I look forward to the next time I visit.",

The Woooo-shi Buffaloooo-shi roll is very different and delicious with all the unexpected flavors.   They have have a good beer selection.

You know with the cheesecake pieces. Mmmm it was so good. I digress.) I asked the server (who was great) if they had a cheesecake kinda milkshake and they don't. When the General manager asked my mother and I if everything was good, I told him it was and it would be great if they offered a cheesecake milkshake and he said he can make me one. Whaaaaaa!!!! He said, \"We can definitely do that for you. Absolutely!\" I asked for some Oreos to be added and he said he can get that done as well. The server came in time to say, \"you never say not to a pregnant woman or you'll get a sty\" He's had 2.   My milkshake was brought only a few minutes later after I ordered and he gave it to me for free! Happy birthday to me! I know it's not my bday.   Chris is dope. Talk about superb customer service and making sure the customer is happy.   Thanks Chris!",

    "text": "Creative menu, delicious food! I tend to like the sushi better than the burgers I've had there. You definitely need to make reservations way in advance or try going for lunch instead. Service is perky and helpful. My only complaint is that because there are no soft surfaces to be found, the restaurant is extremely loud and hearing your waiter or dinner companions can be a challenge. Also, the seats are not comfortable at all. My biggest recommendation is the Tuna Nachos Appetizer. It is not what you think. The Deliverence Roll is also really good. I also enjoyed the Tom Kha Ga soup on a separate visit, which is good if you're not especially hungry as the portions of everything else are huge.",

The bento box was a great sampling of many things...one mini burger, 4 pieces of sushi roll of your choice, edamame, a delicious slightly spicy cucumber salad, and sweet potato fries.  In my opinion, the prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you receive.  If you're not prepared to spend $12-15 for an entree, then stick with the drive thru...you will not appreciate the cuisine.",

I have no idea about the sushi, but from the crowd, it must be well received. The management knows how to encourage people to come back [with a free appetizer card on the first time there]  Cons: The cons of this place don't have anything to do with how the restaurant operations, so I can't take away stars for that. However, the place is big, and it fills up quickly. As hinted to via Andrew H's review... the clientele are a bit lacking. It seems that this is more of a place to go and be seen, not a place to go and be social. From my experiences, people at the bar were more interested in entertaining their friends than enjoying where they are.",

Low and behold the Cowfish stood in its place.  My brother, husband and I decided to try it (since we were there).   The restaurant decor is Japanese modern, but not zen; imagine red on the walls and Japanese comic book themey, and oh yes Cowfish in the aquarium.  This review does not reflect the sushi menu, since we all ordered burgers- myself a veggie burger concoction (not as is listed on the menu), my husband the CBCLT, and my brother the Texas Longhorn.  Long story short, it was the best veggie burger second to Burger Bar in Las Vegas; my husband rates his, best burger EVER!  A year later my husband and I still rave about this place and we plan to go back when we're in town.",

    "text": "The Cowfish is a unique fusion restaurant located in the Southpark shopping complex in Charlotte. To say that this place is popular is an understatement. Four of us arrived for an early dinner before taking a friend to the airport and the place was packed. When we left the restaurant it was the more traditional dinner hours and there were tons of people waiting at the bar and outside for a table.   The idea of a sushi and burger fusion restaurant is very unique and allows the menu to suit the needs of many different tastes. The menu is large there are both traditional and japanese appetizers and entrees. The Cowfish also has some interesting drink offerings including a wide array of alcoholic milkshakes. Our table ordered several hard milkshakes and an additional cocktail. Everyone was pleased with the drinks. For an appetizer we had the edamame flight which features four different seasonings (Sea Salt, Wasabi Ranch, Cajun Sriracha and Sesame Salt). The table loved the Sriracha but they were all very tasty. We also had a seaweed salad which was fantastic. For entrees, two people order the Cowfish bento box which features a mini slider burger, sushi, sweet potato fries, sweet and spicy cucumbers, and edamame. The bento box was good. You get to pick the sushi style and although not the best sushi I have ever had it was very flavorful and well rolled. The other people at the table got a sushi roll and a build your own sushi. They also enjoyed the sushi platters. Overall, it isn't the best sushi on the planet but it is good.   In closing, the food is good, the service was alright, and the environment is trendy. The place is trying to do something different and I cannot fault them for that. This is a place that you will be happy you tried since it is so different. Like some other reviewers, there were some ordering mixups and some food didn't arrive or was delayed. However the manager came over to us, explained his regrets, and made sure that everything was taken care of. Very much a class act. Personally, I would go back and tell anyone to check this place out.",

HUGE portions on burger and fries and chicken sandwich.  Couldn't finish lunch because of the California Roll and insane portions.  Watch ordering appetizers and meal because of portion sizes.  NEVER ran out if sweet tea.  S'more Milkshake to finish was incredibly tasty and loved the torched marshmallows on top.  Would come back just for this! Wish other restaurants cleaned like Cowfish does.  Even on Saturday, floor swept after every table turn and table and chairs wiped down and cleaned thoroughly.  Will definitely eat here again.

The 2nd visit was just as phenom as the first, so I figured it was worthy of getting online to write a stellar review.

The first time, I was skeptical because when I see a large menu, I assume they put a 5 percent effort into each dish (like that chain restaurant a block away). I was wrong. I got the burgushi and the crab dip. My date got the turkey cranberry sandwich thing. He raved about it.   The second time, I had the lamb burger. The feta on top could be it's own menu item, it's so big. It was fantastic! Third time, a group of us were just there for drinks. The bartender was not very knowledgeable on the beer selection. He/She had to be corrected by his/her coworker. I've also gotten the tuna burger, which I loved.   The prices are not too bad for Southpark, but I tend to spend too much because their beer selection is GREAT and I cannot skip the crab dip.  The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because on one occasion, we waited for silverware until after the food arrived, but there A FEW hostesses by the front door just standing around staring into space. Rolling silver is probably not in their job description, but noticing we didn't have it is. There always seem to be too many hostesses standing by the front door. On a different occasion, a server took way too long to greet us. But the food rocks, and owner Marcus is very friendly.",

We tried.....   the salad with ginger dressing--very tasty (ginger dressing a little more runny then I prefer but still good)  the Edamame appetizer---pretty hard to botch that...it was good and there was quite a bit  Seaweed Salad--looked like grass but my friend enjoyed every bite so that's all that matters  The burger with bacon--very good, cooked perfectly, lots of bacon flavor, excellent The burger was served with sweet potato fries and those were on-point and I love that they give such a large portion!  Various Sushi rolls--Miss Moffit, a couple eel rolls, and a couple create-your-own rolls...all very good, fresh, etc.  Miss Moffit is a little small for the price so that is a little disappointing.  I mean for $15 you at least want to be able to tell you had dinner...not so much with little miss moffit.  They accidentally messed up one of our rolls but the manager took it off the bill and took off the appetizers and salads.  I thought that was awesome...great customer service!  The wine list is good and affordable and they had other drink specials as well.  The patio, the atmosphere, the service, the food....all combined make for a great local staple.  It is no wonder they are so popular.  It is a great place to take out of town guests as well.    TIP:  They are now accepting reservations if they are before 6pm and NOT on the same day.  They have some fancy app you can download on your iphone as well and put your name on a call ahead list if you are within 30 minutes of the restaurant.",

I love chilling at the bar while we wait for a table and making fun of the cowfish in the huge fish tank behind the bar.  Check him out, so cool.  There is ALWAYS a wait, but they seem to manage it well.  They text you when your table is ready, so you can wonder off a bit to the nearby shops.  If the weather permits, they have great outdoor areas.    I love the creativity in the menu from the spiked shakes to the many burgushi options and the favorite, bento boxes.  The bento boxes come with a burger slider, a few pieces of a sushi roll, a side (sweet potato fries and fried pickles are good), edamame & cucumber salad.  I am a huge fan of the mark's roll, rigs r&r roll, blackened tuna roll & miss moffit's roll.  The burgers are great too, but I forget which ones I've tried in the bento box (I think byron & lamb).  Fried pickles & ahi tuna nachos are a big hit for appetizers.    I really need to try new things, but keep getting what I love.  Enjoy & save room for a spiked shake!",

They have an array of different burgers and other Asian inspired dishes. The sushi menu is huge and there is so much to choose from. I liked how they had a page combining burgers and sushi. I was in the mood for a burger so I ordered that. I got the long horn burger with sweet potato fries because I love sweet potato fries. The burger was delicious and juicy. It has a sweet after taste. My friends ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer. It was just like the traditional Asian version but broken apart like a dip. They had the duck sauce drizzled on the chips and then the dip on the side very good. Finally their dessert was just as hard to pick from as their regular menu. I ordered the s'more shake with Greek yogurt. I like how they give you the option to swap out things for semi healthier versions. Some restaurants get so stuck on their menu they don't let you do things like that so I appreciated it. I also forgot to mention they give you the option to essentially build your own burger. You can add and subtract different ingredients to suit your needs and they have different proteins to choose from including a veggie burger and bison. I loved this restaurant. I know there is one in Orlando closer to me now all they need is one in Tampa :::hint::: ;-)",

    "text": "Thursday evening - they don't take reservations or call ahead unless you're within a radius (but how would they know where you're located when calling??) - and we get a 30 minute wait with a pager and a text message to follow \"our fish\" on a TV (as it gets bigger and floats to top, you're closer to head of wait).  So we sit at the bar, completely ignored for quite a while, with bartenders and barbacks walking past regularly and everyone else around us that's been served is getting checked up on (and doesn't need anything).  Finally get a girl to get our order and they've run out of an ingredient and is gone without any word for a loooong time, where another bartender now has deemed us worthy to check in with 3 times even though we have already placed our drink order.  My knobby knees drink was very good, my friends was not balanced well with gin and other components and was kind of gross.   We settle up at the bar as our table is ready and we're not feeling very confident in this place.  MORGAN redeems the night!! She knew the menu very well and offered great suggestions, was very attentive and had an awesomely enthusiastic attitude. I honestly was not a fan of the burgushis that were more like sandwiches in floppy fried rice bread patty thingies because i felt they were super messy and hard to eat - not for lack of taste, but my sushi rolls were all around fantastic!   So in review, bar was not a highlight of my evening, food and service at table were amazeballs, I highly recommend the knobby knees drink and seriously waaaay too many birthdays for one evening.",

Both times I have been it has been jam packed and loud but not overwhelming. This wouldn't be the place for a quiet romantic dinner but is perfect for hanging out with friends or family. I had to wait a little while but not too long. Around 30 minutes.   The food itself is scrumptious. Calamari, sushi, burger, and edamame were all spectacular - not to mention gorgeous.   The service was fast and efficient and our waiter was friendly. The food didn't take very long to come out and our drinks were always refilled.  The price is reasonable and you get quite a bit of food for your money. I would certainly recommend anyone to go try Cowfish. It's a interesting experience and I don't think you will be let down.",

    "text": "Went to lunch for hubby birthday. I did research the menu before we came since it is HUGE. the place is nicely decorated and kinda fun. The aquarium is something I could sit and look at for hours while the fish play and chase each other. I especially like the little Cowfish, too cute.  there was a long wait for us, but I didn't mind. I didn't get to check out the touch screens on the bar but maybe next time.  they also have a really big patio that looks inviting.  I noticed several staff who were dressed in a \"management\" looking way and that was expected but I have to say that a lot of the servers looked a little rough, some needed a shave and a hairbrush!   on to our experience. there was myself, hubby and 13 y/o daughter. we started with the crab Rangoon dip. lots of crab in here! and it was very nice I admit, but I would've preferred not to have the sauce on the chips since it made them a little soggy. on the side would have been better.  we had a really nice server who pointed out the highlights of the menu and she was training someone who could have been a little more enthusiastic, but was nice enough.  next we tried the fried pickles, now I have had some great fried pickles but these missed that mark, they were a thicker cut thus the breading doesn't stick on them well and they weren't the crisp kind of pickle. although my daughter was in heaven since it has been a very long time since she has had any.  instead of ordering separately we ordered 3 different rolls of sushi and shared: volcano roll- very spicy and is not for the faint of heart spicy tuna roll- very nice but I like the spicy aioli on top not inside, but was still good crunchy shrimp roll- was really good has some tempura fried shrimp in it.  we surprised my hubby with the typical song and dessert that restaurants do, he was thoroughly embarrassed - mission accomplished.  the dessert was a enormous serving of moose on the loose. it was way more than we could share and oh so good and chocolaty!  we did not finish everything and ended up taking about 1/2 home and we all were stuffed beyond comfort.   cant wait to go back and try a few other menu items",

Main meal was the Nature Boy (burgushi) The Boss and Marks Roll (sushi) - all were delicious.  We topped the evening off with milkshakes (of couse) - I got the Smore while husband had Caramel Espresso - get the S'more you will be glad you did.  This is easily the best milkshake that I have ever had in my 43 years!  While this was my 2nd visit to Cowfish, it was a first for my husband and we both loved the food and service was fantastic.  Nellie was extremely knowledgeable in talking about the menu items and highlighting her favorites - thanks Nellie!  Also, the host stopped by to say hello and to see how our evening was... a very nice touch that is greatly appreciated.  We will be back :)",

    "text": "Went with my wife and daughter,  It was our first time and made the mistake of telling waitress we would take \"first available\" seating. We thought it was a table vs a seat at the bar. Well it was that plus a third choice, sitting outside on the patio in 90 degree heat with 90 percent humidity. The glasses of water on the table were sweating so much there were puddles under them.  It was uncomfortable to say the least.  Anyway the food,  I ordered a Tropical Storm Roll (sushi) The menu describes it as: California roll topped with 3 layers of fresh sashimi (tuna, salmon and yellowtail), then topped with Japanese cream sauce, sweet brown sauce and sriracha. Each pieces is then covered with multi-colored tobiko (flying fish egg) for a fantastic presentation. Served with a side of wasabi yuzu dipping sauce  Even though I read the description, I underestimated this roll. When they say three layers of fish they mean it. The pieces of sushi were so large with the fish on top you had to deconstruct each slice because no human (a snake maybe) could get their mouth opened to fit a piece of this roll. Which was super flavorful.  There was no sign of sriracha sauce but plenty on the table so I added my own.   Upon walking in the door we were quoted 45 mins for a table and I would have walked out by my daughter had her heart set on this place. Good news was that the wait was closer to 15-20 mins. Hostess probably lost a lot of business with those bad estimates, but hey it got me seated faster!  Price was reasonable and I would surely return.",

My husband and daughter enjoyed the Sushi.  It comes in extremely large portions.  They over ordered but they were happy.  I ordered the burger that had pimiento cheese, fried green tomatoes, and dukes Mayo. It had butter all over the bread and to me that is a turn off right away. The fried green tomatoes were absolutely awful. They looked like they were filled in and no green tomatoes.  They looked like they had been frozen fried green tomatoes.  I took them off. The jalapeno bacon was really  good.  They put a huge amount of Mayo on the burger which was literally gross. I ate part of the burger and had chest tightness.  Really!   I guess I should have known that this was really going to be so bad for me, I shouldn't have gotten it. Why 4 stars?  Sushi was great.  Service was great.  It was fun until I had to get up and walk around because I was miserable. I would get a lighter meal on my next visit although I ate very little of this meal.  If you are a sushi eater, go for it.",

If you do manage to snag a table, however, prepare yourself for lots of delicious food that you won't be able to completely finish.  The sushi is great, as one would expect from a higher end sushi restaurant. The burgers are great, as one would expect from a burger bar. The blend of the two is exceptional. Cowfish has a section of their menu titled \"burgushi\" which is American-Japanese fusion of sushi and beef or pork. Everything on the burgushi menu is excellent, however I would really recommend trying the Doug's Fillet Roll.  Also, check out the bathrooms while you are there. Inside you will be treated to a language lesson where you learn to say strange phrases in English, Redneck-English, and Japanese (I think).  As a side note, I swear the fish tank behind the front bar is populated with the cast of Finding Nemo.",

We got there at 7 pm on a Sat nite..it was crowded but wait was only 30 min!! (PS no reservations can be had til after 9pm on Sat walk in traffic only).  We were lead out back to a warm and toasty patio setting.  Kept watching the food being brought out..huge portions.   We still decided to do two appetizers..what were we thinking???  Anyway the crab rangoon dip is to die for!!!  The coconut crusted onion rings were excellent.  Odered a bento box with a cowfish slider of the week and sushi.  Best burger in a long time and the sushi was delish.  PLEASE OPEN IN RALEIGH!!!",

I suggest deciding on a few entrees that can be shared between everyone to sample some of the variety of dishes they offer. Also, if you are a big eater I would recommended an appetizer to supplement your entree. I left wanting a bit more, but still satisfied. I highly recommend the blackened tuna roll, its the perfect blend of flavors in nicely presented roll. Definitely worth a try if you are into sushi or burgers or both!",

Our waitress was very slow, and often times difficult to locate. I had to wait 10+ minutes for a refill. I'm not sure if she was new or what the problem was. (She did ask the grandmother and small child next to us if their meal would be on the same bill). Cocktails were excellent, as was the appetizer (HUGE portions). We had burgers. My husband loved his, but my pimento cheeseburger didn't excite me. I've had better (try Block & Grinder for an excellent one). I'm not eager to go back anytime soon. If they're going to be that busy, they should consider a larger space or opening up another location.",

The rolls are gigantic so one is plenty for me. The salads are by far my favorite. I got a Greek salad with fried feta and it was so over the top good it's the only thing I will ever get at lunch going forward. It was perfectly dressed and was of course huge. If I could split it with someone it would be the perfect!  Also really like the Asian chicken salad. So very good.",

Lucky for us though, we were able to find a bar(ish) table down the left side of the restaurant in front of some of the Sushi Chefs. This turned out to be a treat that helped take our dining experience to another level.  Our waitress was Caroline and while I wouldn't have thought it on first impression, she turned out to be an awesome waitress. Attentive, informative, and able to roll with my quirky humor. With Caroline's help we were able to navigate the extensive menu and settled on the crab Rangoon dip appetizer along with the Turfin Surfer Roll and an amazing roll we were able to put together from their \"Make your own\" roll part of the menu.  This is where sitting in front of the Sushi chefs comes in. Rafali was the key guy behind the counter that absolutely hooked us up. With some fresh slices of the absolutely fresh beautiful tuna he had behind the counter, to his insanely good Jalapeno sauce (which I'm stealing by the way...ha!)  paired with his fun, friendly attitude, my fiance and I had an absolute ball here. Long if the short is.....can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Great great place.  You can really tell there is a buzz going on about this restaurant when you had to wait for 1hr for a table on a Wednesday night!  The hostess was very accommodating though and totally looked out for us - so it wasn't like my friends and I got neglected.    Now, I did not have the pleasure to go to the counter, but my friend Chelsey was describing the old set up, but it looks like Cowfish took the idea and added and edited to get this great fusion/unique restaurant.  The bar wraps around the entire restaurant so it can seat a ton of people - not really sure if you could just walk up and plop down [since we were waiting on a table] but it looks like you could.  As it turns out one of my buddies is a server here so we were lucky to sit in his section and he walked us through the menu... which was a novel.  And an exciting novel at that!  There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, it seems like you can go here probably 20 times and order something new... maybe more.  We put an order in and eagerly awaited our food.  The wait for our table actually worked to our advantage since we got there a little early for dinner, but by the time we sat down we were starving and primed for a good meal.  The food came and it was beautiful to look at.  I of course took pictures so I probably looked like a freakin' tourist, but it was well worth it.  Everything tasted delicious and it was a great first experience [hopefully the first of many].",

    "text": "The short version (out of 5)  Flavor: 3 Originality: 5 Presentation: 3  There a few restaurants that have sushi and burgers on the same menu. I can't think of any that combine the two to make a burgushi.  Quite innovative in the preparation. The rice is pressed with crabmeat to form the \"bun\" with the sushi elements the middle. Can't say it would be something I would crave but it is different in terms of texture and flavor. It would be something I would recommend people try at least once.  I also tried the Elvis burger. Fried bananas, bacon, and believe it or not peanut butter. If its good enough for the King right? The first thing that hits you when you bite into it is indeed the peanut butter. It is lathered in there serving like a congealed glue holding the sweetness of the banana and the crunchy saltiness of the bacon. And then you get to the familiar taste of beef. It is quite a combination of flavors but can be \"heavy\" in taste to some. Not something you would eat on a daily basis though or else you'd want to end up like the King.  On a side note. If you have kids, I would recommend against ordering the chicken nuggets. They seemed overly processed and had the taste beat out of them. Very bland considering tofu had more flavor than these. I guess kids might not mind.  Overall, an intriguing place worth trying once.",

The presentation was beautiful--banana leafs draped over a bed of ice with the fish arranged on top--but the fish was nearly frozen, which prevents those delicate flavors from melting on your tongue as sushi should.  That said I could be coerced to go back but I wouldn't order the same thing.  At a restaurant that has menu items such as \"The Motherload\" and \"Taste Explosion\" it's probably a safer bet to abandon tradition and go with something with a bit more flair.  After all Rick Flair is credited on the menu.",

    "text": "Excellent food.  I was content to initially order a Philadelphia and a spicy tuna roll. I was chastised heavily by the gal behind the bar who, to her credit, convinced me to go for something more unique to the establishment.  I ended up splurging for two of the rolls that were around $20 each. I thought to myself that $20 for a roll is excessive, but as it turns out, these rolls are massive so it's not an entirely unfair price.  The rolls were excellent. One came with a side of poke (pronounced po-kay) tuna (Tazmanian Devil) and the other was great as well, The Boss.  Definitely give this place a look, but expect to spend $25-50 per person if you're going strictly sushi and want to try their \"sushi fusion\" items.  I waited a solid 25 minutes after ordering my food to get it and it was freezing freaking cold in there, otherwise I'd give the joint 5 stars.  I didn't try a burger and I am not enthused with the idea of trying a burger with sushi.",

Unfortunately, I live in Los Angeles so I have to wait til I'm in Charlotte a couple of times a year. I drive my husband crazy chanting Cowfish Cowfish until we arrive.   First, the awesome atmosphere... The place is buzzing with positive vibes, friendly staff, chill cool decor, nice lighting, overall hip chic ambience. It's a perfect spot for me and hubby because I love sushi and sashimi. He won't touch the stuff. He's a meaty meat meat guy. Cowfish has the best of both.   I ordered a gorgeous sashimi combo with huge fresh cuts of fish that were beautifully arranged on a bed of shaved ice complete with a banana leaf and an orchid. I felt like I was on vacation. It was delish! Hubby had a grass fed angus burger smothered in some craziness. Loved it. We shared an order of coconut battered onion rings which are outstanding with the tangy spicy sauce they are served with. I also had a yummy crisp pear sake which our awesome server stopped to fill every time my cup was empty almost by magic, no matter how busy he was. It was rather impressive I must say. What really blew me away was how he really went out of his way to try to accommodate us. I had a strange request which is I really enjoy chili oil and chopped jalapenos or serrano chilis when I eat sashimi. Although they do not use chili oil there, he emerged from the kitchen with sesame oil and the chilis even though I had already said it was no big deal not to have it. It says a lot about a server who is willing to indulge a customer in a random request no matter how busy he was. I'm not sure how to spell his name but it was pronounced Gin, like the drink. I think he deserves a shout out for being so accommodating and friendly.   Obviously, I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a unique twist on the typical sushi bar with excellent food. Can't wait to go back in December. In the meantime, maybe consider opening a Cowfish on the west coast??",

Sushi and burgers are my two favorite types of food, so I decided I had to check out this place.  I came for lunch and the place wasn't too packed. Decided to ask the bartender what to order since I didn't know what was good. He recommended the \"What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich\" so I went ahead and ordered that. One thing I noticed immediately was that they had a great selection of beer. I told the bartender I was visiting from California, and he told me to try one of the local brews that they had. I have to say combine sushi and burger was an odd combination, but my sandwich was delicious! The sandwich had seared ahi tuna, applewood bacon, jalapenos, and it was served with spring roll wrapper filled with sushi ice. My sandwich also came with a side of sweet potato fries which was cooked to perfection! The local brew the bartender recommended was also very refreshing! (Forgot the name)  If I ever go back to Charlotte, I would definitely check this place out! It has an extended menu compared to a regular burger joint. If you do not like sushi, they have salads, burgers, sandwiches, and rolls. The bartender that was serving me was ecstatic to help me out when I was troubled by the menu. He gave me a great recommendation on the beer and my sandwich.  The place seems relaxed and chilled. Besides the food, many people were there for drinks!  (Happy hour) Besides beer, they also have wine, mixed drinks, and sake, which is rare at a burger restaurant. Finally, this place is not overpriced as you expected. If you are in the area, you absolutely have to check this place out!!",

There have been times when trying to place a take-out order was way more difficult that it should be.  It's so loud there that the staff can't hear the order properly.  Other times, it took 10 to 15 minutes just to get someone on the line.  Other than that, it's a great spot.",

Even though it was really busy, we were taken care of quickly for our lunch hour, which is a huge plus!   The Fusion Box comes with a slider, sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, edamame, and a sushi roll.  I loved it all - it was too much for lunch, so I brought the leftovers home.   I think the concept is different and fun.  I would definitely go back!",

There's a line between polite conversation with your guests and just constantly butting in.  We knew what he was doing the night before (spending a lot of money on alcohol), what he was planning on doing today (drinking, and spending a lot of money on sushi), his favorite brewery, what the staff do when they hang out, the list goes on and on. We basically knew his whole life - I was there to catch up with good friends, not the server.  The star I'm taking off is for this.    I ordered a milk shake (caramel espresso something or other) it was not my cup of tea - but that's mainly because I found it way too sweet.   Also got the Mediterranean lamb burger (picture attached) - I cannot stress how GOOD this burger was! I never order burgers at restaurants because I'm usually disappointed but this was great. Lamb burger with feta cheese, capers, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, and tzasicki sauce. Delicious!",

Sushi: Kids love all the sushi here, every thing is fresh and made to order.   Burgushi: fusion of burgers and sushi! Open your mind as your experience these originals.

The concept of the restaurant is very straightforward merging Japanese and American culture.  Like shrimp Marge (Marge Simpson in a shrimp body).  A: The Nature Boy's Woooooooooooshit buffalooooo - it's an explosion of flavors in your mouth.  Spicy so be warned, that last taste of jalapeno really gets you.  It is exactly what you'd expect a burgushi, a burger in the form of sushi rolls.  B+: Dougs Filet Roll - pretty straight forward with the filet mignon, it's like eating a bowl of rice with cut up beef in a roll.  Overall, the food was ok, but the presentation and concept was fun.

    "text": "Whoever thought of this restaurant concept is a mad scientist genius and I want to shake his hand. I can imagine sitting around one drunken night and pondering \"What if we combined gourmet burgers with...sushi!.\" It's crazy, but it really works.  The restaurant itself is your standard chic eatery. It's classy but not memorable, besides the bathroom where the radio teaches you to speak several languages (it's weird and you have to see it!). The alcohol menu is several pages with numerous options for beer, wine and cocktails. The food menu is so long that the server spent five minutes trying to explain it. This could be too much, but if you're with a picky eater, the dozens of options are greatly appreciated. There literally is something for everyone.   There's a full page of creative half pound burgers ($11-$16) and another two pages of sushi. Then it just gets outrageous with burgers topped with sushi or sushi made out of burgers. It all is very fun and unique and I'd love to try the many combinations. After a delicious app of raw tuna nachos (tortillas with sushi grade tuna, guac and salsa) I decided on a bento box. But of course it's not your standard box. This was comprised of a mini Texas cheeseburger, a full order of fries, a specialty sushi roll (I chose the spicy Firecracker), thai cucumbers and edamame ($18). It was a ton of food and very good.  For dessert a Grasshopper minty milkshake was too thick at first but perfect after a bit.  The food overall didn't blow me away, but the concept did and it was still very tasty. This is the perfect restaurant for groups and I wish they would open one in my home state!",

They have so many creations of sushi ingredients in burgers, as well as burger ingredients in sushi. This was a sushi night for our group, so we got a few normal sushi rolls (which were delicious omg, we scarfed them up so quick). We also tried a burgushi that was essentially a sushi roll made with beef, pickles, and other goodies before being fried.   It was definitely unique and tasty! I tend to lean more towards normal sushi for the taste since it tastes fresh and healthy (for the most part). Eating this burgushi, it totally felt like a heart attack in every bite. So if that is what you are into, then THIS is for you.   I can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu, though!!",

If they did have more and bigger, I would sit and eat there atleast 3times a week.",

The place was packed. The hostesses were extremely efficient. They found us 2 seats at the bar area so that we would avoid the wait. Then it just got better. The very busy bartender helped us navigate through the menu ( it is a little too much ) like we were her only guests. When she wasn't there , the other bartender was refilling our drinks. Great teamwork. Even though a manager never made it by to check on us, we saw several managers working hard making things run smoothly.    The burger was delicious but it was under cooked and the fries could have been hotter. Completely opposite of the fried pickle appitizer. They were perfect! The miss on the burger and fries still did not stop us from telling people what an awesome place it is. We will be back and I can't wait to try some of their sushi!",

The taste is like heaven in your mouth! Aside from that, you can never go wrong with the crab rangoon dip and the blackened ahi tuna tacos!   For main course, I love the Fusion Specialty Bento Box. It gives you a taste of both the burger and sushi, which is the whole point of trying a restaurant called Cowfish!   I also love the decorations of the restaurant. There is really cute artwork hung on their walls that makes it look funky and yet modern. It is definitely a unqiue concept to try and a fusion food success story!",

    "text": "I took my wife and 14 year old daughter here tonight on their recommendation as they had eaten lunch here before and really liked it. To start there were two hostesses, one seemed friendly but the other was a complete boob, mumbling into her headset and then to us. We had to ask her if she was even speaking to us...0 personality. The wait was about 15 mins so we sat at the bar for a draft and a wine cooler. Service was great at the bar. We were seated outside as per our request. Service was not so good. I know they were busy as it was 7 pm on a Friday night but you shouldn't have to go without water or drinks for 15 minutes. We started with the crab Rangoon appetizer, it was delicious.   My wife had the Bento box and was quite satisfied with it. She said her slider was the best part. My daughter had the spicy crunchy shrimp and also loved it. I had the Bison burger.......never again. Maybe it would have been better had I requested it cooked well instead of med rare. It was gross and quite a mess on the bun. Now don't get me wrong, I can usually eat anything, but the ingredient combination on this burger were not doable. The side of fried pickles were pretty good.....but not great. During this meal we saw every other member of wait staff except ours. Other tables got better service. Even when she cleared our plates all of our glasses were empty.....she didn't notice.  We later ordered a grasshopper milkshake......eh....it was ok. That's when we decided to ask for water. I would have ordered another beer too but was never offered one. I can't really say if I'll ever go back but I would like to try the sushi. I'm convinced this place has an absentee owner or they were on vacation because no one would have a hostess like the one we dealt with. We watched her seat a couple with a child two tables away from us and as the woman seated her child this hostess stared at her as if she was soooo annoyed, it became comical to watch her facial expressions.",

I don't think I've ever eaten or drank something here that I haven't liked! a couple dishes have really stuck with me because they were too delicious to forget.. like the seared sesame tuna, and the truffle fries! Among the fusion sushi specialties, I'm not even going to attempt listing all the good ones, because I've never eaten a bad roll here!  The concept of this restaurant itself is great; there aren't too many places that serve up the sushi - burger combination! The ambiance is neat, and the staff very friendly. But not everything about Cowfish is praise worthy. There are a couple negatives in addition to the long wait times. the menu is ridiculously extensive, and therefore confusing! and... the prices are kinda crazy too (specially the sushi.) The burgers & sandwiches are decently priced, but can't say the same about the sushi, appetizers or drinks. Probably not a place to go to every other week, but definitely worth visiting at least a couple times (like i said, the menu is too long, and one visit just won't be enough!)!",

    "text": "Cowfish is another ho-hummer. The sushi is probably top three in CLT but the burgers are nothing special and the decor is starting to look tired and shabby. This is one of the many restaurants in Charlotte that was exciting and new when it opened quite a few years ago now, and just hasn't remained interesting. I now go about once every few months when others in my group insist on going. I don't think I'd ever eat here if it were up to me. For the money, there are more exciting choices, including Baku just across the street. For a burger, I'd rather walk over to the mall and spend less for a better burger at Five Guys.   The place also bursts at the seams with kids, which is not ideal for a restaurant this expensive.   One of the worst problems with this restaurant is that, as far as I can tell, it does not take reservations. That inconvenience factor, alone, takes it off my list unless I'm trying to eat at an off time.   Best things on the menu when you go are the Blackened Tuna Nachos, Firecracker Roll, and any of the milkshakes. Those items are why I give it three stars instead of two.   I'd avoid the burgers and salads. And they do this hot mess they call \"Burgushi,\" which is a disgusting combination of burgers and sushi. You should never, ever get that. Absolutely vile.",

Cowfish doesn't take reservations but when you check in at the front they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready.  You can grab a drink at the bar or walk over to crate and barrel why you wait.    The patio is amazing out back!!!",

Is this concept so amazing to people that it overshadows average food?  Do we just keep hoping the food will be amazing \"the next time\"?  I guess it's just me because each time I've been here it's busy.  The sushi is ok... it isn't fabulous.  The burgers... they're ok...not even great.  The service... hit or miss though we did charm some smiles from our server at this last visit but ??? What am I missing here (besides better food and experience?    I tried the bento box and the mini burger (it doesn't qualify as a slider) was very dry; the philly roll was also dry and the only thing I really tasted was the cream cheese in it.  The sweet potato fries were good and I had a few bites of the cucumber salad.  I wasn't paying attention that it has edamame.  I can't eat that, but again...underwhelmed.  My sweetie got the turkey burger which he said was meh.    Now the decor - I'd give that 4 stars with the cool graphic re-imaginings of more famous paintings; the fish tank - those are always nice.  I can't in good conscience give it 2 stars just because I think it's meh, but meh it is to me and I'm pretty sure I've tried it for the last time.",

    "text": "I really loved my first Cowfish experience. I happened to be in the area, craving a veggie burger--little did I know what a big deal this place is! It was about 5:15PM on a Saturday night; we waited an hour for a table. They have a texting system with a grace period of 10 minutes so they often encourage people to wander around the mall while waiting. We did just that.  This place is loud, so be prepared. They fit a lot of people into a not-so-big space. It's not overcrowded, but it's not exactly roomy.  Our waitress was lovely and guided us through the menu. There are SO many options, which they understand, so they give you a lot of time to peruse. I started with the house side salad, which was a pretty good size. The ginger dressing was exactly what I was hoping it would be! Delicious and refreshing.  I had the Heavenly Veggie burger, which was quite good. I'm not sure if I'll call it the best in CLT (still have many veggie burgers to try before claiming that) but it was great. Their chipotle mayo or whatever it was was delicious. And the sweet potato fries were great. I also tried their regular fries, which were delectable as well.  I couldn't resist trying a milkshake and got the smores. MAN OH MAN was this a great decision. There was marshmallow throughout the shake (fluff??? who knows) and it was just so freaking good. My only problem was I truly felt like I was going to explode from fullness at the end.   Having had a glass of wine, side salad, burger, and shake, my individual total was around $30. It's not cheap, but I will happily pay that for this burger and shake experience. Plus, it's a fun atmosphere. I look forward to returning soon!",

Favorites include the veggie burger, build your own burger, the cabbage salad and definitely the truffle fries! Also their Moose is Loose cake is incredible. One thing they could improve upon, however, is the cleanliness. The last time I dined here, our waitress was visibly sick and wiped her nose every time she walked away.

Because we had a long wait, I sat at the bar before my friends arrived, and had a Cracked TOPO. Such a small drink that packed a punch. One glass was enough. Then I ordered the lobster egg rolls. I noticed that the price has been increased. $15 is too expensive for an appetizer of Two egg rolls. Nevertheless, I keep ordering it. It is filling if you want to not share and order it as an entree.  Everyone left full and happy. Service was great, as the waitress was patient while we figured out what we were going to eat. Food was served quickly. I had the Firecracker Roll. Eel is the new kani. They had burgers. The sushi here is delicious. Everyone left full and happy.",

It took awhile to be greeted and get drinks as the bartenders were pretty deep in their conversations with each other. Once we finally got to order our drinks, we ordered our food. I've only eaten here once before and it was a few years ago! I was disappointed to see that the cucumber side is a lot smaller than it used to be! It used to be an appetizer (or something) because in the past, it was enough to feed 3 people and was served piled high on a plate! Miss that! Anyway, my husband did the create your own sushi and I got a burger. Our meals were good but the service and drinks weren't. I ordered a cosmo that I could barely drink because it was so sour and I would have asked to have it remade but again, we were barely spoken to. I remembered it as being a fun, friendly place to go and enjoy but it seemed to be lacking this evening. Not sure if we'll be going back or not.   Ps- parking is scarce. Park in the parking deck and walking is the best option.",

The blend of sushi and meat is definitely something that I didn't think that I would like, but it's actually very complimentary and delicious. If you are going for dinner, definitely go early. If you go at a normal dining hour (past 6:00), you will probably have to wait 2 hours on a weekend night. Going for lunch is also a great option since there aren't a lot of people either! But if you do have to wait, you can always go shopping at the mall right across the street! They also have super awesome decorations of movie and musical posters spoofed up with cows and fish- super cute.",

We had a 45 minute wait( which was unusually short according to other people waiting) which is not bad because they text you when your seat is ready. So you can visit the shops around the restaurant.   Started off with the tuna nachos and they were freakin awesome!! We had decided to try the burgushi even though the burgers and sushi looked amazing around us.   I got lamburgushi and my wife got dougs filet roll. Dougs fillet was the way to go though. I got a yellow tail roll just to try some sushi and it was absolutely perfect.   Great service and good food. Probably should expect a wait. It's first come first serve at the bar. Next time I'm just going to get a burger because I really wanted one after I saw a few come out.",

The BBQ sauce for the burger was so delicious-not too sweet with a little bite to it. The sushi was equally delicious. My boyfriend got the lamb burger and The Boss sushi roll. He liked it so much he ordered another box with the Jammin Burger and Pinky Swear roll. High quality fish and high quality burgers!

I was a bit hesitant only because I'm an adventurous eater and love sushi, however, my daughter is a no-fish, no-spicy, no weird combo kind of girl. Cowfish fit us both. We both got the Bento Box. She had the shrimp tempura roll and a regular mini slider in hers. I had the Firecracker roll and the speciality jalapeno cheese double burger in mine. She loved her meal, though she said the cucumber salad was too spicy for her. I loved everything about my meal. The sushi was excellent. I thought the 4 pieces would be small but they were huge, to the point I had to cut them in half. The burger was a good sized and perfectly cooked slider. I like spicy so I liked the salad. And the edamame was plentiful. Also, I got regular French fries and even though I'm not a fan of fries, these were good enough for me to bring home the leftovers.  I also ordered the ahi tuna \"nachos.\" Don't let the word nacho fool you. It's more of a crispy cracker with their (incredible) crab Rangoon dip, avocado, and beautifully seasoned pieces of fresh tuna. It was excellent, fresh, and refreshing.   We were pretty full so we did some shopping. But before we left we headed back to try their milkshakes. Any place that has marshmallow in a shake has my business. I ordered the Smores and my daughter got the Cake Shake with chocolate cake. Hers was sweeter, like cake and ice cream in a single sip. I could even taste the frosting from the cake. The Smores shake was rich in marshmallow and graham cracker flavoring though neither overpowered the other. Towards the end, I got a lot of chocolate syrup so they could tone it down just a bit on that. We got our shakes to go but that didn't stop them from being presented very nicely. They were, to put it simply, pretty shakes. Pretty darn yummy ones that is!",

We all had bento box lunches that included a mini burger, sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, edamame, and a sushi roll. The little burger was out of this world and now I wish I had gotten a full sized one! Meat was flavorful and fresh (the waitress told us it was grass fed/organic). Sushi was good and so was everything else in the bento box. I wish the sweet potato fries had been crispy, but they tasted good.  I usually do not comment on the decor (I go for the food), but it was very nicely decorated and modern looking with really cool pictures and objects on the walls.",

    "text": "The food was great however the reason I'm giving 4 stars are for a couple of reasons: when we first got there the hostesses told us it would be a half hour wait so we decided to order drinks from the bar (spiked shakes) I got a text saying our table was ready within 5minutes. My boyfriend waited at the bar for 10 more minutes and our drinks were still not done finally the bar tender said she'd bring them to us when they're done. They came and had goo dripping all down the sides of them we had no napkins. Our first waitress was super nice and then they changed waitresses mid shift. The next one forgot about us because we were sitting there finished for 15min then she ran out to our table in a panic saying \"are y'all done?\" Besides that the food was actually very good. My sister and I substituted the burger in the bento box for a veggie burger and you can substitute the sides for an extra 0.50 cents each.",

I ordered the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Burgushi:  Ok I'll admit when I first saw this I was underwhelmed. Just some iceberg lettuce too much bacon (is that possible?? I pulled out 5 strips of bacon.) finally you have a layer of yellowtail tuna. But then... Then I pushed it down & took a couple big bites...The favors were explosive. Tuna was boldly seasoned. Bacon provided that burger comfort. Lettuce was fresh & laced with their special sauce. To my surprise the spring roll wrapper they used for the \"bun\" was stuffed with rice & crab. WOW",

    "text": "I knew that I would have a great time at The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar from the minute my wife and I walked in.  As someone growing up in the Northeast, I had heard of this supposed \"Southern Hospitality\" in myth and legend throughout my entire life living in the cruel and cutthroat suburbs between NYC and Philadelphia and accustomed to eating meals in restaurants with gruff wait staff that cannot hide their sense of derision. But no longer will I have \"Southern Hospitality\" in my myth-list under the Lochness Monster and Bigfoot! My wife and I could not have had a more pleasant experience with our host Scottie (major props for his recommendations, followups, and friendliness that made us feel as though we've known each other for years), continued with Jamie with his SPOT-ON service throughout our entire meal.  Speaking of meal, everything we ate was delicious; we started \"traditionally\" with the \"Double Salmon Roll\". As a fish lover, the balance of the smoked salmon, fresh salmon, and creamy avocado was a very tasty combination. That being said, I was especially happy that the rice of the sushi (in my opinion, one of the key differentiators between mediocre and GOOD sushi) was cooked to the perfect done-ness.  The wonderful eating experience continued with our entrees. The better half ordered the \"Fusion Specialty Bento Box\" with \"Mark's Roll\". First, the best way to describe \"Mark's Roll\" is to think of a Philly Roll that comes from, as (in)famous chef Guy Fieri could describe, a Philly Roll from FLAVORTOWN USA. The bento box itself was DELICIOUS; the mini burger was the juiciest slider I've ever had; sweet potato fries were such a great balance of crispy, salty, and sweet; the Thai cucumbers were so fresh and refreshing and such a great counterpoint to the other heavier sections.  My choice of \"The 4-S\" was decided when Jamie, our waiter, described the creation of the \"bun\" on the 4-S \"sandwich\" - Soy paper wrapping imitation crab meat with rice SMASHED in a panini press. How could I say no to that?! Despite my impulsive choice we were, yet again, very pleasantly surprised with the dish itself. Essentially, it is small steaks of tuna and yellowtail topped with a crisp and bright mix of greens and peppers, all \"sandwiched\" between these 2 \"buns\". The pleasure of eating this sushi sandwich goes FAR beyond the pure novelty of this concept; the flavors and textures certainly lived up to expectations.  Our coda to the meal was the \"Fresh Berry Tall Cake\" with the ice cream on the side (curse our intolerance of lactose!). Honestly, if there was a \"worst\" part of the meal, I would probably rate this course as the least-best, BUT please do not misunderstand - the dessert was still delicious. This cake, plus a cup of the Jasmine Green Tea, was a wonderfully sweet and soothing way to end a wonderful meal.  Though our time in Charlotte is quite short, and the aim was to try different places every day...The Cowfish is making it very difficult to keep that objective. Who knows, we may be back for more before the end of the week.",

    "text": "Came here on my layover in Charlotte. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about this place because the fusion of burgers and sushi sounds quite bizarre and I'm not a huge fan of Asian fusion in general. I was delighted when Cowfish ended up being surprisingly delicious. My gf and I both ordered a bento box, which was half a roll and a specialty slider with three sides. My bento consisted of: half of the Tropical Storm roll, Dynamic Duo slider, sweet & spicy Thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries and bacon coleslaw. The sushi roll was scrumptious, fish was really fresh. Loved the look of the colorful tobiko. Slider was also tasty and the perfect size, any bigger and I would not have been able to finish my bento. It had juicy braised short rib, sweet roasted garlic and tomato onion jam on a Hawaiian roll, it was divine. Enjoyed all the side as well, devoured everything. Yummmm!  What made our visit memorable was our server Cameron. He was so sweet and friendly! The menu was overwhelmingly big and he took his time to answer all our questions despite being busy; the restaurant was packed. He also gave us a few recommendations on what to do in Charlotte, since we were tourists. Not only that but he also hooked us up with a fresh berry cake because it was our birthdays. Such a sweet heart! Needless to say, we really really loved dining at Cowfish.",

I wanted to check out Cowfish because they had so many reviews with great ratings. Yelp didn't disappoint!   It was a slow early evening, so we sat ourselves at the bar. First, the service was amazing! Our waitress offered us samplings of the beers on tap. I actually ended up not getting one but our waitress didn't mind at all. She was great!  We took a really long time to order because there was so much on the menu, and everything sounded so good. I ended up getting the 4-S burger, which was seared tuna and yellowtail on a bed of sprouts and salad with spring roll paper stuffed with rice and kani as the \"bread.\" I've never had spring roll paper stuffed with rice and kani as \"bread\" before. It was pretty cool! I have to say though that if you ate the whole \"burger\" as is, you won't taste much of the tuna and yellowtail. I actually deconstructed it to eat just so I can taste the flavors of everything! A spicy chili soy sauce dipping sauce was served with the 4-S burger. I got a side of fried pickles. I asked for a dipping sauce for the fried pickles. Our waitress gave three different sauces - ranch, sweet chili, and horseradish aioli! So nice of her! Ranch was definitely the best sauce for the fried pickles. I really enjoyed their fried pickles!  Overall the food was great and the service was excellent! I would definitely return to try other things on their menu!",

    "text": "I was in town for business and met a friend for dinner. I should mention, I worked in a restaurant for 5 yrs, am a foodie and take my reviews seriously. My friend, is culinary school educated and has been a chef for 11 years. We know service and we know food.   This was my first time at Cowfish after hearing rave reviews from my friend if their burger rolls aka \"burguishi\".  The restaurant was busy and no seats were available at the bar. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. While people watching we saw a few patrons with children which was off-putting. I honestly would not bring a child here unless they were over the age of 10. It's just not the appeasable scene.   We were seated by the manager whose friendly candor was very much welcomed by me & my friend. I wish I remember his name, but he is the type of person that gives you a good impression and gets you excited.   Unfortunately, our assigned waiter was far from savvy as the manager we met. The waiter appeared rushed. So much so that in his haste he failed to listen each and every time. I requested hot green tea. He informed me they don't have green tea, but a citrus one and mumbled. It wasn't until he left that I realized he was gonna bring me iced tea. NOTE: A hot tea patron and an iced tea patron are two different classes of patrons. When he returned with the ICED tea, I informed him that my intent was for a hot tea... He directed me to the page FULL of hot tea options. My friend took the iced tea as he had initially ordered water and I drank the hot. At this point, I was NOT impressed by the waiter. My friend was not convinced my upset was valid.  I ignored that the waiter referred to the special rolls as \"entree rolls\" suggesting a single order would satisfy. Two rolls per person is the standard, but there's no need to argue to someone who clearly was unfamiliar with the menu & the fate in general. We ordered our meals.  My friend wanted the large tuna roll that he has seen being ordered. The waiter unfamiliar with the menu or the popular items was unable to direct him and never asked his colleagues. My friend ordered a roll similar to what he thought was the popular one and modified it by switching the fish. He requested spicy tuna instead of salmon but was informed they only had tuna and spicy is via the mayo. :/ This is where this place began to lose my friend. I ordered as well. We previously ordered an appetizer which was very similar to Bonefish's bang bang shrimp.  The meals arrive, we begin to eat. We notice the tuna he requested never occurred and the salmon is still present. We alert the nearest server who was yet another manager and the waiter arrives as well. The waiter, although he wrote and spoke as he wrote the modification was very defensive that the order was not right. No apology did we receive. Instead of having him finish the wrong dish and bring a new one, the roll was removed. He sat and starved as I ate and another replaced about 10 minutes later.  Still, no apology not did we get the...\" Let us treat you all to a drink or a shared dessert\". Nope nuffin. And for that, they completely lost my friend.   We finish our meal & get the bill. The iced tea was charged to us & no courtesy deduction of anything was made. Me being me, I leave a decent tip with a note for him to not be hasty in his service and to listen, apologize, satisfy & thank. Upon our departure, we run into the manager who seated us who asks how we enjoyed our meal and we reveal, honestly.  I hate to give bad reviews because the place is great. It an fusion and the clientele is blended and trendy. I'm not sure if the server was having an off day, is new or is used to waiting tables at Sonic, but I just need someone to pull him aside and teach him the right way. During our table side chat, we discussed how this guy was so clueless and would probably be embarrassed if we were to reveal who we were and what we knew.   My friend moves to DC so I'm less likely to partake this location with him again, but I would go again if I had the chance. If ever presented with the same waiter, I would walk out. No second chances with that one. Sorry, not sorry.",

There is a massive menu of both burgers, sushi and even salads, sides...  that makes it easy for most people to find options.  I'm a vegetarian and had no problems.  The food does always taste good though.    What is unique about Cowfish is that you can order something you've probably never had like the burushi or alcoholic milkshakes.  The experience would be much more satisfying if the wait wasn't so long (the bar area is always full too).",

Accomodated special requests perfectly.  Presentation was great.  Timing for such a large group that had both a combination of raw & cooked items was right on.  The menu is so extensive with rolls that you don't see anywhere else in the Fusion specialty section be warned that it could take a while to decide.  Overall ambience is pretty noisy & having to really speak up so the person next to you can hear you.  Reservations are definitely recommended.  The mgr provided 2 free appetizers - the sweet & spicy thai cucumbers & the Ahi tuna tini.  Both appetizers were fantastic!  We had a couple of sushi virgins with us who gobbled the Ahi tuna tini.  It was phenomenal.  The rolls are so large that definitely have them cut into 10 pieces.  I had the Nirvana & the blackened tuna roll.  Both were a-ok.    The Blackened tuna roll was a lot of rice & expected more fixings with how it was described.    The Nirvana roll was the better of the 2.  The caution here is that it is whitefish so if you aren't in the mood for fishy taste compare it to being in the mood for a more gamey meat option like quail than don't go with the Nirvana.    Everyone had different items & everyone was in sushi heaven! We will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "Now here is a new winner.  Great presentation and great food.  The noise level is a bit high, but I understand they have some fixes coming for that.  The menu is very extensive and original.  Service levels are high.  The technology on the bar (built in i-pad like devices) is very original -- and it works.  Eat your lunch while reading the newspaper beneath your plate. Or play a game while waiting for the food. Decor, and the entire concept are fresh, and to top it off, they have their own shuttle bus from the mall to the out-parcel where they are located.   Parking was open very close to the restaurant the day I had lunch there. So that was a plus over competing places as well.",

Overall the menu was a bit pricey, but i enjoyed the food. I ordered the Southpark Roll and the Doug's Filet Roll.  I've had the filet roll at Eez and they were identical.  The only real complaint that I had was that I ate by the door and it seems like every time a child walked in the door, the staff allowed him to hit the gong. My friends were startled by the gong as it went off about every 5-10 minutes. That was quite annoying.  Other than that, I had a great experience.",

Even in the restrooms, the soundtrack playing is a \"learn how to translate Japanese to Cowboy phrases\" CD. LOL, very humorous idea!  This place always has a lively atmosphere and their sushi is really good and fresh. My favorite item is the Blackened Tuna BLT. It is an absolutely glorious burger. Ive probably ordered it 4 times already. With one of the times that I ordered it to go from the bar, the bartender forgot about it and it ended up getting cold. I did end up waiting close to 30 minutes for the order but even without asking, the bartender placed another order for the burger, gave me free soft drinks at the bar, and comped my meal. This really was the icing on the cake for this place. Highly recommended.",

Normally that might mean terrible service, but the roving bartenders were all super attentive and extremely excited about the menu.   We ordered the Spicy Thai Cucumbers (those are not to be missed, seriously delicious), the Thai Mango Salad (not fantastic, not terrible...), and because I was insanely hungry and also super curious about the menu, we ordered a sandwich from the Burgushi menu (the Alaskan \"Turkey\" Sandwich) along with two sushi rolls, the electric eel roll and the dynamite roll. The burgushi was FANTASTIC, and I chose the seaweed salad for my side (huge portion, yay!), which is one of my favorite things on the planet. My husband devoured the electric eel roll, which he pronounced spectacular -- and it was gorgeously plated. The dynamite roll was good...the sushi pieces are a little bigger than I prefer (practically impossible to eat without cutting in half).  All in all, I LOVED this place and I will absolutely be back. Maybe tomorrow...",

The restaurant is located right outside the mall in a little strip of businesses. A few parking spots are available in front of the restaurant.  Based on the pictures from other reviewers, I decided to go for The Taste Explosion burgushi. For those that are unfamiliar with burgushi, it is a sushi roll with burger ingredients inside.  First bite impression: burgushi is really good! You kinda have to get past the idea that you're eating a slider in the form of sushi though. A couple bites later, I thought to myself \"meh.\" Initially, I was enthralled with the idea of sushi and burger combined, but maybe my expectations were too high? It's a unique idea that works, but I was not that impressed in the end.",

As someone mentioned the menu is kind of outrageously large and that usually means lesser quality and a slower kitchen. I appreciate a restaurant that does a small menu phenomenally.  It took about 15 minutes (3 stops by the waitress) and finally her recommendation before I placed my order. I ordered the original cowfish bento box with a Philly roll, slider, sweet potato fries, edamame, and cucumber salad. The sweet potato fries were delicious and the cucumber salad is literally (the original definition, not the new ridiculous one) the best I've had at any sushi bar. Everything else was pretty basic and the service was pretty slow. They messed up my sister's order. My friend and I were nearly done eating by the time she got her meal. The manager brought it out and comp'ed it.  We ordered dessert too! A tower of lemon pound cake, ice cream, whipped cream, and berries. It was amazing. The three of us couldn't finish it! After dessert we waited for our check. We were chatting, but after 30 minutes or more we had to ASK for our check. The atmosphere was nice and maybe I'll try going at a less busy time before I make a final ruling on the service. I'll be back.",

When we first came in, we were told the wait was about an hour and a half. Since we went all the way out there just for this restaurant we decided to kill time at the mall nearby. When we got back, they told us it was another 45 minute wait! A lot of people were coming and leaving as soon as they heard the wait.   Everyone I was with ordered something different, but most notable were the Parmesan Bacon Truffle Fries that my cousin ordered. It was more than enough to share, and it had cheese all over the bottom of the bowl. Ooooooo man! I ordered the Mad Mango-cado roll, and although it wasn't anything extraordinary, the serving was perfect.

    "text": "I really liked this spot. Food was probably a 3 star but service and environment were 5 stars. I'm in Charlotte pretty often and feel a lot of places here are a bit overrated. Maybe it's a 3 star but for Charlotte it's a 4 star.  Stick with the sashimi grade fish and burgers. The burgushi isn't that great, maybe I'll try more of those selections in the future. The lobster and crab spring rolls were great and reminded me of the pappadeaux rendition.  I did enjoy my greasy and overly topped (good thing in this case) jalapeno show stopper burger with fresh otoro and saba sushi on the side. The Saba (mackerel) was very good and the burger with sweet potato fries was good as well.  My party thought the service was great from top to bottom even though I heard mixed reviews about the food. Mostly the burgushi seemed to be in question.",

The shop was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating. The hostess/ waitress was attentive at all times, and very knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was more than filling, loved all the dishes thus far. We will certainly be returning soon and would recommend this facility. My husband and I loved this place Im sure everything is a must try! Good relaxing meal, no pressure by the staff to hurry up. Parking may be a issue, for us no problem that day.",

I also ordered the specialty bento box with Mark's roll, Mark's roll was by far my favorite thing I ordered!  I sat at the bar, the place was packed on a Tuesday night. The bartender always made sure my drinks were full and once the placed died down a little, came over to chat a little.

Surprisingly, we were contacted by the management and asked to come back and give them another opportunity and we took them up on that invitation. Our dinner meal on our return was outstanding and we have placed Cowfish back at the top of our restaurant choices here in Charlotte. Cowfish exceeded our expectations and we thank them for their EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE and GREAT FOOD. This was authentic Southern Hospitality as they take pride in insuring every customer is satisfied.

    "text": "It was my last meal in Charlotte this go 'round, after another extended 5-day weekend visiting my parents, and I knew I really wanted something different before leaving. Having eaten my fill of Southern style specialties while staying at home with them, my radar began blinking frantically when I did a quick search for new (relatively) places in Charlotte since my last visit. Having worked in the area for many years selling wine I had already been to most of the more unique spots in the city, and then I stumbled upon what surely had to be a typo...The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar? Ummm, what? Then, my mind flashed to my last trip here over Christmas and some shopping that was done at South Park mall. I recalled riding past a place with a burger and sushi on the awning, and my immediate reaction at the time was a similar \"what the hell?\" Well, nothing more had to be said. I didn't even have to pull up the menu to know this would be my destination for lunch.  When we arrived at our destination, which you would likely never find if you weren't specifically looking for it, it was a bit past prime lunch hours (somewhere between 1 and 1:30), but the restaurant was still surprisingly hopping for a Monday afternoon. I passed up the chance to eat outside, as you have no idea what the patio space looks like upon entering. This was a mistake, not because the inside was bad, but because after I saw the nice large patio adjacent a beautiful fountain I really wanted to be eating out there. Sitting inside did offer a vantage point of the strange and humorous wall art, half mocking half embracing the fusion of burger and sushi, along with an enormous fish tank and easy access to our server. A quick trip to the restroom revealed another of Cowfish's oddities, a foreign language \"learn to speak Japanese\" track playing, combined with what could only be described as \"learn to speak Redneck\" version. Hearing the cute little J-pop voice followed by Cletus was certainly a shock, and I made another visit before leaving just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating (and I had to rinse an obscene amount of grease from my beard).  The real reason for coming here though is obviously the strange mix of food offered on the enormous menu. First are the appetizers, some of the best meal starters I've seen offered. This isn't your typical \"hey let's fry something or add cheese to it\" type of appetizer. They're all well thought out and incorporate a breadth of flavor profiles. Then you've got a page full of burger options, followed by several pages of very creative sushi rolls, and finally their signature item, a combination of burger and sushi they've deemed burgushi. It sounds like something the bumbling idiot Fabio from Top Chef would pronounce, but the concept is actually quite appealing when you see the menu descriptions.  I began with a couple appetizers, hoping my mom would assist me in eating them so I would have room for a burger, and the \"Mother Load\" roll, which features a piece of every fish on their menu in one hell of a creative presentation. I wound up eating both of them by myself though, so I had to cut out the sushi. I started with the blackened Ahi tuna nachos, which are wonton chips topped with crab Rangoon dip, pico de gallo and avocado and some seared tuna. I thought the quality of everything in this item was superb, although the crab dip definitely overtook the flavor of the tuna. It really benefitted from just a few drops of added Sriracha to help balance all the flavors. Next up I dove into the Caribbean summer rolls, which have boiled shrimp, lettuce, mint, mango, cucumber and chive, and when combined with their spicy peanut sauce they were actually some of the best spring rolls I have ever had, anywhere. The size was huge too, definitely worth the $9 price tag if you're debating which appetizer to order.  In between the appetizers and our burgers came the only real faux pas of the meal by Cowfish, and that was actually delivering our burgers just minutes after our appetizers had arrived. I had eaten literally one and a half of the big nachos, and not even begun on the rolls, when both our burgers were brought out. I decided not to complain and just go along with it, mixing bites from everything at once, but then I bit into my burger and realized that the medium rare I had requested was actually medium well, and produced no juice whatsoever. This I had to say something about, and it was promptly remedied by the chef, and comp'ed off the ticket by the manager.   1) Businesses take note, that's how you take care of a customer.  2) Yelpers take note, that's how you correct an error without bitching about it and deducting stars.  As for the actual burger, I went with the Arnold Hamandegger (self explanatory), and when properly done was wonderfully juicy, with just the right amount of egg yolk seeping over the bacon and ham. The \"Cowfish sauce\" was pretty tasty too, and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly.",

I've never taken a bite of a burger before and thought, \"I wonder how this would taste with sushi ingredients.\" Conversely, I've never eaten sushi and thought, \"Man, this would be great with burger ingredients.\" And that's really the magic of the Cowfish. It's innovative eating at it's finest, one that will open your mind and better yet, your taste buds. As a kicker to the crazy menu, they have handmade milkshakes (including some with alcohol!) that will be a perfect dinner wrap to your dining. A must in Charlotte. Enjoy!",

I few weeks ago though, we went on a Tuesday. We still had to wait a bit, but it was not a big deal. We both ordered the bento boxes. We want sushi and burgers. There was barely any real food! The burger was smaller than a slider and you can't even get a full roll. It was full of edemame and some weird cucumber salad. Needless to say, we were both hungry when we were finished. The waitress didn't seem surprised that we were still hungry-- that should be sign #1 that you're not providing enough food! When we got out bill, we were shocked at the receipt and really wondered why it cost that much... Keep in mine we only drank water. Needless to say, don't order the bento box--- it is just full of snack type food and is over priced!",

The food is amazing, decor is vibrant and fun (not to mention the \"translations\" in the bathroom - HILARIOUS), and staff is so friendly and attentive!  This is how every restaurant should be.  Packed on a Tuesday night, so you know it's good!  Must try the tuna nacho appetizer.  DEEEE-LICIOUS.  This was my birthday dinner pick, and it was all I could have hoped for and more.  If you're wondering - if you tell the server it is your birthday, they'll bring out the 3 layer pound cake/ice cream dessert with fruit and it is amazing.  The birthday song is pretty clutch, too!  We had our 2 year old with us and we got him one of the kids' bento boxes - so adorable!  Two sliders, fries, a cute little sushi rice smiley face, and a drink - perfect for the wee'un!  All in all, a fabulous dining experience.  I can't wait to go back!",

We didn't make advance reservations, so planned to go for lunch instead. I hear the wait at dinner without reservations can be 2hrs+. We waited about 10 minutes on a Saturday and sat at the bar while waiting for a table. This place has a really cool atmosphere. My wife ordered a sushi roll - the \"Neon Deon\"  with mango, coconut, and avacado...one of the most different (and awesome) sushi rolls I've tried. I got the \"Burgushi\" Burger+Sushi...it was a mix of burger ingredients and sushi ingredients - also excellent! The service was attentive and fun. I would highly recommend this place and we'll be back. Just be sure to make reservations in advance, especially for dinner.",

Love the old westerns mixed with godzilla and kung fu movies! I also like that the sushi bar has the interactive screens built into the bar, but they definitely need upgrading or tweaking because there are way to many bugs. Playing memory is fine, but their pac-man type game isn't very responsive. But - you're not there to play games you're there to eat and this place excels at that.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because the dirty martinis my boyfriend and I ordered weren't dirty at all, I don't think they had any brine in them at all. The next time I came I had to order it \"very\" dirty and it was fine.",

But, I talked to the server and he said burgushi was the way to go.  So I tried that and man what a good decision.  Very flavorful and somehow the beef (which was raw-similar to steak tar tar) seemed to melt.  The rolls were large and really worked well with wasabi and soy.  The server was very helpful.  My mother who only eats california rolls got the Boursin Bird which is a chicken sandwich with boursin cheese.  I tried that as well. Very good but the burgushi was where its at.  I would like to go back because the menu is so large (which is both positive and negative its a bit overwhelming.)  My only negatives were it was freezing and we were placed right under a speaker that was blasting music.  But that also kind of made it fun, just couldn't really talk.  Hope to be back soon.",

The Rangoon Crab Dip appetizer is to absolutely die for....when we order this and it's a large group, I usually just order like 2 or 3 of these b/c I usually down one by myself. I think I had the best burger I ever had in my life, the C.B.C.L.T.....I can't even put it in words. The service is always great, but the only reason I can not give it 5 stars is because it is always too packed, waiting for a table can take up to an hour, this location doesn't take reservations due to it's popularity, and last but not least, the Southpark snobs that frequent this place get to me sometimes with their \"my s*** doesn't stink\" attitudes they like to dish out. Besides those extremely minor things, this is a great restaurant.....4 stars",

It was so good that now I have had it about 5 times from various places in the past couple of weeks.  Anyway... the sushi was wonderful!  The fish tasted very fresh and the wasabi and ginger didn't taste cheap and generic like most other places.  After our meal, the manager/owner? came out and spoke with us and invited us back.  Very pleasant experience.  And again, the seaweed salad... best I've had... crave it all the time.  I went back a couple of days ago and had the same thing along with the avocado and crab summer rolls.  They were delicious too, and the fish on the Tropical Storm roll was cut so thickly I couldn't eat the pieces in one bite, but had to take 2 or 3.",

    "text": "Non-sushi food was great, service was AWFUL. My husband & I went to the Cowfish for lunch on Monday 12/27. First, the hostess screwed up our wait for a table- took down our name, told us to wait 20 mins, then couldn't find out name, told us to wait again, then told us that our name was not lost but on the list the whole time. WTF? This ordeal took 20 mins on a Monday afternoon- hate to see what would've happened on a Friday night.    Thankfully, 2 seats were available at the bar, which helped end our discussion with the hostess. Un-thankfully, the bartender/ waiter was a total prick- because he wasn't paying attention to us (kept looking over our shoulder to someone/ something?), we had to repeat our order 3 times (even pointing to the items on the menu) before he got it right.   We ordered the coconut battered onion rings as an appetizer, which were divine. Too bad our bartender forgot our request for plates for the onion rings because there were coconut crumbs all over the bar. He was a little annoyed that he had to wipe up all the crumbs. I ordered the sushi nigiri combo with wonton soup. The california rolls didn't taste any better than what you get at the supermarket and the dumplings in the wonton soup were still frozen on the inside. The soup broth was luke warm. My husband ordered the cowfish original burger with fries. He said it was good, but he's had better at other restaurants.   During the entire meal, our bartender never refilled our empty soda glasses and wasn't around during much of our meal. After sitting around for 15 mins with empty plates & empty soda glasses, we had to ask a different bartender for the check. When our original bartender finally showed up with the check, he was not happy at all when he saw our living social coupon. After the coupon, our bill was $2.38. He practically threw the bill at us with a scowl on his face- no smile, no thank you, no \"come back & see us next time.\" I guess he's not a fan?? We still left him at 15% tip on the entire $32.38 bill, which we feel he did not deserve. Will we go back to the Cowfish? No, even if there's another living social coupon. If I want to eat a frozen wonton in lukewarm soup, I'll do it at home. If I want mediocre sushi, I'll go to the supermarket.  If I want a burger at a sit-down restaurant with excellent service, I'll go to Big Daddy's and gladly pay full price.",

If you're looking for a place to go on a second or third date, you've found it.  Everything on the menu could and will start an interesting discussion.  \"What do you think pesto and tomato would taste like on a tuna roll?\"  Exactly.  You have to try it to find out.  They also have a good drink menu and an enormous bar so if you're like me and prefer to have a casual dinner with lots of drinks while sitting at the bar... this is it!  However, there were a lot of kids the night that I went so refrain from profanity and too much PDA.  Although, no offense to those with kids, that didn't stop me ;)",

    "text": "We love Cowfish, sushi, asian fusion dishes, burgers and even what they call Burgushi, which is basically meat in rice and other sushi type ingredients and sauces, but very good indeed! We usually go on a weekend when it is very very busy, however each time they tell us it will be an hour to an hour and a half wait and each time it hasn't been more than 45 minutes. I'm certainly not complaining about a shorter wait time, be sure about that, but my fiance and I have a theory that they do that to keep the \"buzz\" about the place. Like they are sooooo good at what they do, they want you to know it takes that long to get into the place. It's either that, or the hostesses aren't very good with time management! Really, the only negative is that every single time we are there, we always get seated on the patio (in Spring or Fall, we don't mind at all!) and always at the table right by the door with people and waitstaff constantly going in and out, the trash being dragged out from the kitchen to the dumpster etc. While we affectionately call it \"our table\" now, it isn't in the best spot and we saw plenty of tables open inside on this cold blustery night (the patio IS enclosed and heated in winter). Now...we aren't in the \"beautiful people\" crowd and thus our 2nd theory about the place. Now onto the real good stuff...their spiked milkshakes are uber yum. My fiance gets one for dessert every time we visit. His favorite is the one spiked with Jim Beam. This most recent trip it was our anniversary and we casually mentioned it or they overhead us talking about it, so at the end of the meal, the waiter said \"Happy Anniversary, your appetizer is on the house\". How cool was that! And said appetizer was the Lobster & Crab Spring Rolls, ohmigosh, so delicious! On a previous trip we have had the Blakened Ahi Tuna Nachos, which are awesome  as well. We had 2 rolls this time around both recommended by our waiter, Mark's roll and the Foreplay role (has oysters in it) and enjoyed both very much. The menu is very large, take your time to go through it all. Burgers are also delicious and totally worth a try. Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable, great service. If you live in or are visiting Charlotte, The Cowfish should certainly be on your list of must try's!",

I arrived at 5:40 for a 6:00 o'clock reservation, and found a parking spot right in front of the door.  This was a sign that it was going to be a good night.  It was half price Sake night - a carafe of Fuji Apple Sake was a great starter while I awaited my friends.  We were seated promptly when everyone arrived.  Our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful explaining the extensive menu.  One guest and I decided to split the Caribbean Summer Rolls, and I am glad we did, otherwise I would not have been able to eat my dinner.  I chose Filet Oscar Roll from the Burgushi menu, while another diner chose the South of the Border Roll, the third party in our group went for the Moriawase dozen and was glad she followed the waiters recommendation to start off with the dozen and if she wanted more he could increase it to the double deuce.   Everyone enjoyed the food.  Desserts were ordered to go.   My apple pie wontons were alright, but probably would have been better if I weren't so full and could have eaten them there while they were warm.  A nice touch was the owner coming around to ask us about our dining experience and to hand out cards for a free appetizer which are good until the end of 2011.   I like the burgushi concept.  Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar is definitely on my list of favorites and places I would go on a date or take an out of town guest.",

    "text": "Worth the wait (or sitting at the bar). This place is busy and for a good reason. If you can't decide on what type of food to eat for dinner then you've come to the right spot. You can have sushi, burgers, cheese fries, fried pickles, and so much more! And they have meals where you can do a mini burger and a small sushi roll. It literally cannot get better than that. Because we were super hungry and wanted everything, my husband and I ordered the truffle bacon Parmesan cheese fries to start. Best French fries I've ever had in my entire life. And it was a huge serving. We felt super fat for eating all of them. Then we shared Granny's southern pimento cheese burger with fried pickles & Mark's roll (sushi). All I can say is that it was all amazing. We ate so much that we could barely walk out. I can't wait to go back and try all of their other menu items.   From a hospitality standpoint, everyone was extremely nice & even though we sat at the bar, our waitress was extremely attentive. Bar seating is a great choice for a party less than four. It's really wide so there is plenty of space for food and drinks.",

One of the few times I decided to go for tea vs beer and was pleasantly surprised. Tea was super strong and loose leaf filtered, sugar was natural honey.  They have a collection of lunch dishes that are plenty big enough to make most people full, eg. sushi roll that's big enough for 1 haha.   Unique little location that's directly across from stellar shopping. While you're in check out the cowfish hanging out in the aquarium in the front bar!",

On this visit I tried a burger, it was huge, The granny's southern Pimento cheese burger. It was Pimento cheese, fried green tomato, red onion and more, I selected the sweet potato fries as my side and received a nice amount of fries, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The place was fairly large, customer service was adequate, not super cheerful or anything but professional and helpful. My order took a while but it was worth the wait.  Note, the sushi that others in my party ordered did look pretty good, I think I'll try the sushi option on my next visit.  Overall enjoyable lunch!",

The peanut ranch dressing really makes this salad.  I don''t eat a lot of sushi but everyone I've been with who has had it said that it was great.  The milkshakes are also very good here and a great way to end your meal, if you actually have any room left for it!",

When she finally came by, we ordered our beer/wine and appetizer. The appetizer came a few minutes later. Our drinks and napkins finally arrives right as we were finishing our appetizer.  We then ordered our our sushi, she repeated every roll back and I had to correct her on one. I then had her confirm the order by reading the list of my phone before she left. After the order came out, we informed our server that one roll was wrong. She apologized and took the tool, only to come back just to tell me that she did not have that roll written down. We then went back over exactly what we had done, with the correction and all. She then admitted that she made a mistake. She said \"thanks for keeping me in check\"???? It then took another 30 minutes to get the corrected roll. Then she dropped the bill as if nothing was wrong. Did not offer for us to talk to a manager, or take at least the toll that took an hour off the bill.  Luckily Andy, one of the managers came by and asked how everything was, so we explained. He was very nice and did what he could salvage what was to be salvaged of our visit. Thank you Andy.",

But this time around I wanted to try something different since I couldn't find the sushi roll I was addicted to. I had the blackened tuna roll and honestly when I saw the hostess put a super raw looking sushi roll into my bag I panicked because I'm not a fan of \"raw\" or fishy sushi. Let me tell you that was the best sushi roll I ever had! I can't stop thinking about it!  Crab Rangoon dip doesn't disappoint either!  I totally recommend this place for dine-in or take out. But it does seem to always be busy! Obviously for good reason!! You go CowFish!",

The place was packed already, but Cowfish accommodated us beautifully. Now let's get to the food:  Blackened Tuna Nachos-yes please. Very simple, yet tasty with a slight kick of heat.  Lobster and Crab Spring Rolls-nice crunch and tasty filling. I would order these on a regular visit.  Tuna & Avocado Tini-this was my least favorite item of the night. The tuna chunks were just too humongous and with the avocado, the dish was way too soft. It needed a texture intervention. A texturvention. It also lacked salt.  The Burgers-they just came out on trays and I tried one that was available. It was super tasty.  Overall this was a great experience and Cowfish showed up and showed out. They offer a cool concept, check them out.",

The turkey burger on the menu was an Apple Berry Brie Turkey Burger. I wanted a Turkey burger without cheese and with lettuce, tomato and avocado. The waitress suggested that I get a Bare burger that was plain and add the toppings. Seemed simple until I received a bill that was almost $19. I didn't realize that there was a Turkey substitution charge of $2 and that didn't include the toppings. It was a great turkey burger but I am disappointed in the price and the waitress for not communicating. I will not order that again. Way too much for a simple turkey burger and why should turkey cost so much more anyway. I paid more without the trimmings if the original menu option.",

    "text": "We came here for Mother's Day because I had been wanting to try it forever. The wait took forever. Once we were seated we ordered a California roll as an app, a kids plate, a burger/sushi box combo thing and a southern sushi roll that had pulled pork. App came quickly, however it wasn't rolled super tight so it fell apart. Our kids plate and combo came out together and it was all delicious. I feel like the combo could have had a little more food but since we had an app we got full. The waitress made us aware that she forgot to put in our other roll but the kitchen was on it. Well. We finished eating. We waited. We waited some more. And we waited some more. I was annoyed by this point. The manager brought the last of our food out and we told her we were full and didn't want it. She offered to box it but we said no thanks. We weren't mad, we just weren't hungry anymore. She ended up comping the entire check for us minus the alcohol and apologized several times.  Because of her making up for a mistake without having to ask and the food we had being really tasty--5 stars, more if I could. I wish all restaurants had this type of management. It goes a long way and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Allow me to preface this review with two things: first, I know sushi and Japanese food very well and second, I have dined at San Francisco's fabled Kyo-ya when it was still around--and this was when it was widely regarded as the finest sushi in the Western hemisphere. So I don't balk at expensive sushi in nice surroundings. I do however have a dim view of pretense and trying to just charge high prices because of a trendy atmosphere and a clientele who seem not to know any better.   Other reviewers have described Cowfish as \"fun\" and maybe it can be, but to me, not so much. It's over-crowded and the waitstaff rushes you along yet when it comes time for the check disappears as if sucked into a time warp. My sushi was ok, but just ok. Not impressive, not innovative by a long shot. Typical Americanized sushi for girls in their Vineyard Vines shirts and their boyfriends in boat shoes. It was like the Abercrombie of sushi. And the chocolate torte dessert I ordered was pretty awful and rather gummy--plus overly sweet for a flourless chocolate torte.   If you're shopping at South Park Mall and want sushi and a friend wants a burger, I guess come here. The other options around South Park aren't much better (the cafe in Nordstroms however is good). But their version of sushi is very mundane and their service lackluster.",

But overall it just felt like it couldn't decide between burgers or sushi. So neither could I...  I got the Bento Box (sp?) so I had a little bit of a taste of a few different things. A few small pieces of a California roll - which was not that great, a mini burger slider - which was pretty delicious, some sweet potato fries - also not that great, and edamame - which was just normal good edamame.  The thing that I will suggest, if you find yourself at this restaurant by default cause a friend wanted to go, is get the Crab Rangoon Dip. I've never had this in dip form before but it's about time someone did it. And this place did it well! Warm, great dip and perfectly done \"chips\" with just enough sauce. Definitely the best thing I had there. But I got tired of it fairly quickly. I'm sure the big portion is meant for more than two people.",

    "text": "Not the best sushi I've ever had, but it definitely hit the spot. Enjoyed their Big Al's Yellowtail and Tuna and Avocado-tini appetizers. Also loved their Spicy Tuna Roll. Spicy tuna is one of my favorite rolls, so I order it at every sushi restaurant I go to. Usually the tuna is diced up into tiny pieces and mixed with some sort of spicy mayo sauce. At Cowfish, the tuna wasn't diced up, and I think I actually prefer it that way! I probably wouldn't order their sashimi again though. It was good, but not the best quality and the pieces were sliced too thick and big (which can be seen as a good thing to some).  It was a little weird to me to have both sushi and burgers on the same menu, but I think they pulled it off as well as possible. We tried the All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi. It didn't have any raw fish in it, or fish at all for that matter, but it was all of the components of a cheeseburger in the shape of sushi. It was pretty good.  I couldn't decide which dessert I wanted to get, so I ordered two. That was a mistake... they were GINORMOUS! I enjoyed their chocolate torte, and my husband preferred their berry tall cake. I thought the pound cake in the latter was a little dry, though the multiple scoops of ice cream helped with that.  I would definitely come here again. Make sure you take a look at the cowfish in their tank on the way out!",

    "text": "Burgers and Sushi in the same establishment?! Sign me up! Going in, I knew this place would either be amazing or a terrible decision for my stomach but I had to try it. Glad I did! Although it's probably making Japanese sushi chefs everywhere cringe, this American twist on sushi tasted amazing.   We visited mid day and were seated immediately. The waitress gave us a full rundown of each section of the menu, which was an extensive variation of burgers, sushi, and BURGUSHI(we will get to this later). To start, we order the crab Rangoon dip which was delicious. The chips had a drizzle of Sweet Thai chili sauce. Everyone at the table loved it. Next up I chose the Brento bento box which came with 2 burger sliders, 4 pieces of one of their specialty roll sushi, and your choice of 4 sides. I upgraded my burger sliders to add some pulled pork on them and chose the firecracker roll for sushi. Those were legit some of the best sliders I've ever had. The flavor that they were able to achieve in the sliders were great. The sushi was amazing and super fresh as well. The Brento bento box was a ton of food and I was stuffed after it.   Of course we also couldn't come cowfish and not try their Burgushi - which takes the traditional sushi roll and adds some red meat items instead of fish. Others at the table ordered the nature boy roll with bison in it so I sampled it. This roll was a complete flavor explosion. It was so good we almost ordered another to go. Now I'm going to have to go back a try all of them! Definitely a fan of this spin on sushi.",

We went on a Monday night around 7:00 pm and still had a 15 minute wait for first available.  So we sat at the bar and had some libations.  Once seated we were greeted within 5 minutes. We freshened our drinks and looked Over a VAST menu. This menu is awesome.  So many sushi options but also so many more things to try.  The burgers are awesome. The appetizers are great. Deserts are insane.  I had a HUNKA HUNKA burger !  Google that and prepare to be amazed.   The place was above average cleanliness. Bathrooms were clean.  Our server was great when she was around.  We didn't see her for about 30 minutes after our food came.  Anyway ... overall a good visit.

We were excited to find 2 open seats at the bar on a noticeably busy Saturday, however when we sat, we were met with a brisk \"what can I get you guys?\" from the female bartender.  No \"hello,\" \"how's it going\" or any other greeting of any type.  We had to ask for a second menu, as we had just sat down and hadn't had the chance to even look yet.  Once we did get orders in, it became immediately apparent that our bartender was either a new hire who was overwhelmed by the volume, or extremely irritated and not afraid to show it.  As our visit progressed, another gal came behind the bar with her and helped wash and put away dishes.  We soon learned that the original bartender must have been toward the beginning of her shift and came in to a messy or understocked bar.  I know this because she and the other girl were openly (and rather loudly) discussing how upset and frustrated they were.  When she came back for our food order, it was \"you guys know what you want?\" ... again in a very curt tone with a dismal expression.  I also watched her greet other guests the same way, sans any greeting or pleasantries.   My \"No Sleep til Brooklyn\" shake and Boursin Burger were delicious, and toward the very end of our visit when we asked for go-to boxes, her attitude improved, and this is the only reason the rating is still a 3.  I don't like to post negative reviews, however being in a service industry, I don't appreciate going to a place to spend money and also leave a tip, just to receive sub par and unprofessional service.   The vibe ruined our meal and we ended up taking over half of it home, just to clear out more quickly.",

The point though is that the staff was nice and honest enough to tell us the real reason instead of making up excuses, and even when we never expected it or asked for it they took care of the ENTIRE bill. I was just worried the girl who took care of our table didn't get in trouble, they didn't have to do that but They were so nice and apologetic!  So they said: hope you want to come back some time and I say: WILL DO GUYS! That attitude is priceless and I still love the food",

We had tried another restaurant and had an absolutely terrible experience, so quickly Yelped nearby burger places. The thought of burgers & sushi sounded very intriguing, so we visited. This place was great - it could be casual or a bit fancy just depending. We all got burgers and some sushi and it was all delicious. One person even got a milkshake, which was amazing. The service was fast, great atmosphere, and delicious food. We would definitely visit again",

    "text": "Before I set foot in The Cowfish, I had every reason to have high expectations. I wanted to love everything about it. I should have loved everything about it. However, love is a bit too strong of a word to describe my experience.   The place was packed when we arrived, so we took our pager and wandered around outside until a table cleared up. In addition to the pager, they ask for your phone number. They'll bombard you with annoying texts as you wait. Lesson learned.  The wait wasn't bad, and we were seated in their covered patio/leper colony area. The walk there was treacherous; the floor inside the place was all oily and slippery. After making it to our seats in one piece, we were promptly greeted by our server, who was very thorough in her explanations and attentive in her service.   There's a great selection of beverages, from hand-spun shakes to beer and sake. Two people in my party ordered the hot ginger tea and were impressed. I stuck to beer, and the last in our group ordered a sake sampler. All of the beverages were good.  We started off with some edamame. Paying $6 for a frozen steam-in-bag pile of edamame irked me a bit and set the tone for many of the menu items: they're way overpriced for what they are. For entrees, we ordered a variety of things, including a burgushi roll (Doug's roll), a burgushi bento box, a roll/sashimi combo, and a sushi roll. I enjoyed my Doug's roll, which was flavorful and really unique. It was not worth the price. The other menu items were fair at best. The rolls fell apart easily because of poorly cooked rice. In general, it was a really lackluster experience.   The Cowfish is great in concept. In reality, it was a place that served a vast menu of creative but mediocre and overpriced sushi. If this is the best sushi place that Charlotte has to offer, I feel bad for this city.",

A best bet at lunch is the bento box -try the kids version too- less pricey option but almost as much food.  I feel pretty darn eh about the burgushi.  Pass.  Get the ahi tuna nachos or seared tuna sandwich or salad. Really can't go wrong with any burger here. Most sushi rolls are fried and gigantic. Not really anything wrong with that- Cowfish is an indulgence not a place to stick to your diet. Speaking of which- spiked milkshakes or just a milkshake- get it to go because you will be stuffed. Service usually is on point- even with large groups. I have had my birthday celebrated at Cowfish twice and it is consistent and always delish.",

You can go in dressed down and still feel good. I recommend trying it at least once.",

    "text": "Yo, so I'm cruising around Charlotte and wanted to find something to eat, had a friend recommend this place and I was blown away!  First off, it's a pretty popular place so if you're here on a Friday night with a party of more than 4, expect at least a 40 minute wait. Cool thing is, they'll text you about your wait status just in case that little vibrating thing.   When you're seated, notice the decor behind the sushi station. I thought it was the cutest thing with their attention to detail. This place is a fusion between sushi and burgers so you'll see a mix between soy sauce bottles and ketchup/mustard bottles.   Now, I took some of the advice of my fellow yelpers and started with the crab rangoon dip. Now, I can't say i'm a master of crab rangoon, but it was pretty awesome. Nice texture, i like that the deep fried chips had sweet and sour sauce on it for some added flavor.   Since it was only my girlfriend and I, we opted for a burger and a sushi plate and shared. Ordered the blackened tuna roll and also the jalapeno-popper-show-stopper (say that 5 times fast) burger with a side of sweet potato fries. What was cool was that since we were sharing, waiter went ahead and have the kitchen split our meal into two plates instead of us having to do that awkward \"Can I have an extra plate and knife please\" routine. So props to you my friend!   The burger had jalapeno and the waiter did say it was spicy but that's because he doesn't do spicy well, but I didn't think it was spicy at all. The burger was cooked medium-rare (how I love my steaks and burgers) and the jalapeno added a nice kick but nothing too spicy. I would say if you can handle hot fries, you can handle this without a problem.   As for the sushi, decent. I can't comment on how great it was or whatnot because I think I liked the burger more and that the sushi just didn't stand out in my opinion.   The fries though, solidly deep fried with a pinch of salt for flavor. This is legit sweet potato fries right here, none of that BS sloppy, limp fries once it gets to your table. These are still piping hot and crispy. I loved them.   Don't be scared of the menu (I know I was when I first saw it). There's A LOT of stuff to choose from. Just ask your server for recommendations and I'm sure they'll steer you in the right direction.   If I was in the area again, definitely would try this place again.",

In short, I won't be eating here again. The fact that this is going on and it has gotten this bad tells me it's a process/mgmt/staff issue. It will take time to resolve.

This time we ordered the Crab Rangoon Dip, Edamame, and the Specialty Fusion Bento Box. Which is perfect, you get a mini burger included in your bento box. I have been here on more occassions then I can count and this place has never disappointed.",

Reservations are hard to come by too, as it's voice mail only, and you only find out the morning of if your reservation is accepted.  They need to get on OpenTable or something.  Not sure what they can do about their seating issues, but have to take one star off for that one.  Our server, Brian was friendly and very helpful.  He recommended a nice chunky unfiltered sake that scratched my itch for the night.    Felt like something unique, ordered the filet oscar roll from the burgushi menu.  This roll was great, except it was too dry.  The filet everything inside the roll was fine, it's that the crab cake on the top combined with the rice made it difficult to chew and swallow.  Eaten separately, removing the crabcake from the filet mignon, portabello mushroom & asparagus center, it was fine...  The traditional sushi and sashimi was great!",

You can sometimes get seated faster if you are willing to sit at the sushi bar - depending on how long the wait is I would maybe opt to go that route (especially if there is a sports game you want to catch while eating).   I have had both their burgers and various assortments of sushi (rolls, sashimi, and nigiri) and they are all very good. As the name suggests, Cowfish is good at two things: burgers and sushi!

    "text": "I always yelp out a location when visiting a new city.  Out of all of the places in Charlotte, this is the one that stuck out to me as something I needed to see.  Being from LA, we have a much larger selection of places to eat and I just thought this was niche for Charlotte.  I have to say that overall I was disappointed.  Sigh.  I was hoping for so much more.    I went there on a Sunday night.  I was worried about it being busy, so that's why I choose Sunday.  The location is chill, right in the middle of upper class shops.  Parking was a bit of a pain - but we found a spot in the lot.  The service was...well....not really there.  The menu is huge.  WAY too huge.  Why offer people so much?  Just doesn't make sense to me.  It took over 20 minutes to make a decision and I'm telling you I still didn't make it all the way through the menu.  The waitress kept telling us the \"top picks\" - well then why not just have the \"top picks\" as your menu?  It was so overwhelming and confusing.  Also part of the food selection process is the overwhelming amount of ingredients.  Like how many things can you shove together that possibly haven't been shoved together in another meal.  I found this hard - too much information to digest.  Figuring out which taste pallet to go for was too difficult.  So I stuck to the burger.  And what I thought would be simple - the black Truffle burger.  Now....I know my truffles.  KNOW them.  Intimately.  But this burger fell short.  It was suppose to be a truffle explosion in my mouth - the menu promised:  beef burger topped with black truffle cheese, roasted shallots and truffle-infused sauteed mushrooms. Served on brioche with leaf lettuce and roasted garlic aioli.  What I tasted when I ate the burger:  An overcooked burger in grease with mushrooms and maybe some truffle oil drizzled on top then a soggy bun.  The brioche would have been good but since it was soggy it didn't taste right.  The fries were way too much for a serving.  The waitress did her best to try to pump us full with drinks - must have come by every two seconds trying to get us to try another drink - but once the food arrived and she realized we weren't drunks, she never came back to ask how the food was.  So very disappointed on that note.  Once they realized we weren't there to drink I feel like the service really dropped and they just wanted us to move along.  Shame.  So overall it was not the experience I was looking for in Charlotte.  Next time I am in town I will try another Yelp selection.",

Initially, we thought that we would have had more space for our party and nature of the event, but we were kept to the tables and chairs set up. However, the mgrs. were willing to accomodate by bringing over additonal benches if possible.   Our waiter was more than helpful. For whatever reason, we were given one waiter for our large group, so he was constantly getting this and checking on this. He was as attentive as he could be for the large crowd. I would have liked another dedicated server to ensure that no one was without drinks, plates were being cleared, etc.   The food was great, as usual. We had a lot of options that were shareable platters for our event. None of them were too pricey either.    Overall, I like the restaurant and I would patron it again. However, if a private room or the entire patio could be used for an event, I would look at them again for hosting an event.",

So if it is just you and a couple of people you will most likely get lucky by catching seats at the bar.   The Sushi is okay. The flavor is good, however you don't get that taste of freshness that I always love when eating sushi.  The burgers are good! I am not a very adventurous person when it comes to my burgers, but I enjoyed reading the descriptions of all the different and odd burgers they offered there. I got the BBQ burger and it was very good. (Better than the sushi in my opinion)   The drinks are excellent! I always end up getting the spiked milkshake, it is absolutely delicious for anyone with a sweet tooth.  Service is average. However, it should be better for the amount of money that you pay to eat there.  I have seen a few families with small children there. In my opinion this is not much of a family atmosphere. However, some people obviously disagree with me. I just find the food and the overall ambiance a little too mature for children.",

    "text": "Took a large party of 10 people and had a long wait as expected about 1.5 hours.( they dont take same day reservations). out group had been trying to get together for weeks to get here and it was worth it  The Appetizers We ordered their Crab Rangoon Dip & Crispy Calamari. The Crab Rangoon was fantastic as was the Calamari. The sweet/spicy sauce they use is put on the plate and the Calamari over the top So I had the waiter bring a side of the sauce because it wasnt enough)  The Entrees I ordered the CBCLT which is a Beef burger, sharp cheddar cheese, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, white cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Served on brioche with our signature Cowfish sauce. Honestly may have been the best burger I have ever had Even better than a Kobe Burger in Tampa last year. It was juicy and just fell apart in your mouth. for a side I ordered the onion straws whch I wouldn't order them again (I like em but they are always so greasy, don't know why I try) but their shoestring french fries were great.  My wife order the Taste Explosion Roll which is Seasoned natural Angus ground beef, applewood bacon, fresh jalapenos and spicy cream sauce inside of a sushi roll coated with tempura flakes. Each piece is topped with marinated Roma tomato and pepper jack cheese, then baked to perfection. Drizzled with cashew cilantro pesto to finish. She loved it..for me I though it was good but for the price and what they give you I feel you would be better off with their normal Sushi which was a whole roll.  All in all this place is fantastic and will def go back...expect a wait if you dont get a reservation. The place does die down after 8:30 tho on a Saturday ...so go early or late.",

    "text": "Sushi meats American protein is the best way I can describe this! It's unique, can serve variety of cravings, great location, and awesome food. If you are a foodie and enjoy trying new things, definitely a Burgushi entree is the way to go.  Spicy Togarashi Shrimp - good large serving appetizer that serves 2-3. Sauce drizzled on it was plentiful but not overwhelming. Good spice added kick but with some Asian slaw and it could easily be thought of as salad with spicy shrimp.  Surf & Turf Roll - Ground beef on top of a traditional sushi roll - Yes. Roll had cream cheese, tuna, and salmon so it felt like a sushi roll but the ground beef made it feel more feeling than when I normally eat sushi. The roll was glazed with a sauce that gave it some additional flavor but made have been a little excessive (as with most specialty rolls at sushi joints).  This restaurant stands out around all the chain restaurant neighbors because they offer something different and new. Give them a shot.  Definitely looking forward to my next Charlotte visit and The Cowfish!",

The food is hot, plentiful, inexpensive for the quality, and DELICIOUS EVERY TIME.  My favorite is the CBCLT (or something like that) which is basically a great cheddar cheeseburger with all the trimmings.  I love the sweet potato fries served with the horseradish aioli.  My husband loves the fine onion strings but also asks for the horseradish aioli. :)  Our favorite dessert (although I must admit we can't get past the deliciousness to try any other...) is the Triple Berry Tall Cake.  Be warned... it is HUGE!  Moist lemon pound cake with premium vanilla bean ice cream, fresh whipped cream and berries.  It always tastes so fresh and \"summery\"!    This is our favorite restaurant in Charlotte and we have been to MANY.  We recently took our son for the first time (he is vegetarian).  He ordered the vegetarian sushi (not sure of the name) and it was delicious, also.  We all loved it.  He is taking a date back for a birthday celebration this Friday. It was a hit!    My friend loves the Pimento Cheese burger (served with a fried green tomato on it) served with fried pickles.  She is so stuck on it she has never tried anything else! It seems whatever you order the first time has a hold on you here! :)    Be sure to try the Dreaming Tree (Dave Matthews Band) Cabernet Sauvignon!  Also, be forewarned about busy times like Friday and Saturday.  Many times there is a 2 hour wait if you go right at dinner time.  Try going in mid afternoon! Oh-oh, I shouldn't have told you that....",

    "text": "So I have been wanting to try Cowfish for what seems like forever, and finally made it there the other evening. My friend and I decided that if we were to go, we would definitely go on a Tuesday as they have there $5 10oz Martini Special. And lets just say that did not disappoint. They have some interesting Martini's going on here, but I started off with the \"Chocolate Dipped Fortune Cookie\" Martini which contained an Amaretto and Bailey's combo with a hint of vanilla vodka and my friend started off with the \"Magnificent Mango\" Martini which contained Mango liqueur and vanilla vodka. Both were excellent!!!   We advised the waiter this was our first time at Cowfish, and he went thru the whole Menu (as it is pretty large) and informed us of \"what we need to know\" to get thru and understand the Cowfish experience.   We deiced to start off with the \"Crab & Avocado Rolls\" Appetizer which are crispy spring rolls filled with lump crab meat, fresh avocado and tomatoes & Served with cashew and cilantro pesto..... This went perfect with the Martini's!!!   Now as for the Entrees I'm not a big Sushi Eater, so I was definitely on the \"Cow\" portion of \"CowFish\" and my friend was all about some Sushi, so she ordered the \"Fish\" portion... LOL. So I can't really talk about the Sushi here in this review, but I will talk about my Burger. So I ended up ordering the \"Shroomin' Swiss Burger\" which is a Beef burger loaded with Swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms. Served with roasted garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato on a brioche bun. And my Side that I ordered was the Sweet Potato Fries. I have to say... this was alittle piece of Heaven!!!! The burger was cooked to perfection, and the Sweet Potato fries were just right.... definitely not overdone.   In between our delicious meal it was Martini time again, and we decided to switch it up this time.... I ordered the \"Cheeky Monkey\" which contained Malibu, Midori, Cointreau, vodka, pineapple, cream, fresh lime and my friend ordered the \"Orange Rush\" which contained Orange vodka, Apple Pucker, with splashes of Sprite and sour. Again both were excellent, but I think I may have preferred the Cheeky Monkey just a little bit more than the Chocolate Dipped Fortune Cookie. Also noticed that others who ordered the Fortune Cookie Martini actually had real Fortune cookie on the side of the Martini glass, which is a nice touch, but Mine was absent when it came to my table.   But overall I was very pleased with this place. The atmosphere was great. I definitely recommend reservations if you wanting an actual table as there aren't that many. It seems most people sit at the Bar because its HUGE, and goes a long the entire restaurant. Also loved some of the artwork on the walls!!! I will definitely be back!!!",

Luckily we were able to grab a couple of seats at the bar and we didn't have to wait.    Just so happens that all Sake is 1/2 price on Thursdays so my friend ordered a bottle and I decided on a glass of white wine that was ok.  The Crab Rangoon dip appetizer is superb to say the least.  Since we were both feeling sushi we decided to split the Moriawase Double Deuce which consists of an 8 piece California Roll, an 8 piece Spicy Tuna Roll and 6 pieces of Nigiri (1 each - tuna, salmon, whitefish, yellowtail, shrimp and kani).  It was all very fresh and tasty!    After we were done we decided to walk next door to Zink for a quick drink at the bar.  To our surprise the bar was basically empty except for Ric Flair and his 20 something girlfriend....Woooooo!",

    "text": "We went to Cowfish this past Sunday night and arrived around 6:30 PM.  Who knew that on a Sunday night in Charlotte I'd need a reservation?   Our party of seven waited 45 minutes for a table.  Everyone was very nice, though, and even the manager apologized to us for the long wait.  I think the problem is that Cowfish has a huge bar to sit at (and I mean HUGE; it starts on one side of the restaurant, wraps around, and continues for miles down the other side) and not a lot of \"large\" tables.   Now I know, though, so I won't be caught off guard in the future.  I've never seen a restaurant in Charlotte so busy on a Sunday night, that's why I didn't think to make a reservation.  At any rate, I loved looking around the restaurant.  It's come a long way since it was The Counter.  The walls are painted a deep red and extend high up into the warehouse-like black painted ceiling.  The bar (which I mentioned earlier) takes up a lot of space.  If you're a couple, it makes a great spot to sit, talk, eat, and drink.  Any more than two people, though, and conversation is probably difficult.  The giant paintings on the red wall are humorous knock-offs of famous art pieces or pop culture icons.  Burger King getting dissed by Wendy?  \"Fine, have it your way.\"  Classic.    Our server (very friendly and attentive) explained the menu to us.  If you thought the menu at Cheesecake Factory was a book, check out the menu at Cowfish.  You need about 20 minutes to look over everything just to begin to narrow down your choices.   Since we had waited so long for a table, we started with the Sticks, Sweets & Strings -- regular fries, sweet potato fries, and onion strings.  For $5, it was incredibly huge and plenty for sharing with a large group.  Plus, it all tasted so good.  While we waited for our table, I noticed a group of women who had HUGE sushi rolls on their plates.  Their diameter was the size of my wrist.  So when I saw the Fusion Specialties section of the menu featuring \"entree-sized sushi rolls\" for more money than the hamburger entrees, I assumed that's what they had ordered.  I finally decided on the \"Mark's Roll\" - fresh tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, kani and scallion roll, coated with panko and flash fried, topped with Japanese cream sauce and sriracha, and served with ponzu dipping sauce.  Everyone else ordered burgers.  When our dinners were delivered, I was quite disappointed to find that my entree-sized sushi roll was no bigger than a larger-sized sushi roll at another restaurant.  It wasn't really \"entree-sized\" when everyone else got a HUGE, stacked burger with fries.  Don't get me wrong -- it was delicious, but I'd stick to getting a couple of the cheaper sushi rolls next time or else a big, thick, juicy burger.  For $10, they looked like quite the value.    And, speaking of value, the kids' meals are about $5 on average.  There is a wide variety of choices for kids, and the meals come in bento boxes where every little cubby hole is FILLED with different foods.  The kids even got more food than me!  I'm looking forward to going back to Cowfish (despite my smaller meal) because there are SO many things to try on the menu (there's even a wide variety of salad entree choices), the prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is classy, yet casual.  I'll just remember to make a reservation next time!  (Or sit at one of the many, many spots along the lonnnnnnnnnnnng bar.)   And, yes, there really is such a thing as a cowfish.  And you can see them swimming in the giant fish tank on the other side of the bar as you walk in the restaurant.",

    "text": "So I think it's high time I review The Cowfish! I do believe my friend and I came here about 5 times a month every month last year!! Seriously when he finds a restaurant he likes he sticks with it.  That being said the wait time here is uber ridiculous.  We found that if you show up between 9-10 you don't have to wait though lol.    Neither of us is a big fan of the giant specialty rolls they have as we tend to like less fussy sushi. So every week (usually Wednesday) we'd go in and order the same thing.  The Moriawase Double Deuce ( 6 pieces of nigiri, spicy tuna roll, and substitute the spicy yellow tail for the California roll), we'd also add another spicy tuna or spicy yellow tail and occasionally a bagel roll. Their spicy tuna is my favorite spicy tuna roll I've ever had in Charlotte. Everywhere else serves it minced except for cowfish and minced fish to me is kind of gross lol.  We always start with the minis of the day (miniature burgers) and generally either Saki or martinis.  Their martini selection is really good and they make a great dirty martini which is what he likes. I go for the specialty ones myself.  Personally I really like their sushi and their burgers are VERY good.  The fried pickles are great as well and you'd think it would be a hard thing to mess up but many restaurants in Charlotte do!    Now we rarely have enough room left for desert but on occasion we get it, or I should really say that I get it and take most of it home.  I have a weak spot for their Fresh Berry Tall cake.  I mean a serious, I will go here and wait 45 minutes just so I can get it, weak spot!! Honestly it's nothing out of the ordinary.. all it consists of is lemon pound cake and vanilla bean ice cream layered and stacked 3 deep (of each layer). Then it is topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. However the lemon pound cake is to die for and for whatever reason completely resonates with me.  Just one of those things :-) I generally like to order it sans ice cream and take it home so I can have a slice of pound cake for desert for the next three nights!  Service here gets a good 4/5 rating. There have been a couple of misses but they were usually new. Otherwise the waiters tend to remember us and our order (we include a lot of substitutions).  Lately though we've been opting for another sushi spot but after writing this review I may have to reinstate the Cowfish ritual!",

    "text": "Do you like giant hamburgers? Do you like fantastically fresh and creative sushi? Do you like a page long craft brew list in the $3-$4 range? Do you like a giant picture of Japanese Elvis watching you eat?   If so, then Cowfish is for you.  If not...we probably shouldn't hang out.  We showed up on a Saturday afternoon and there was about a 25 minute wait so I can only imagine what dinner sans reservation would be like. The servers were all super friendly, from the bartender who brought our drinks and stopped to shoot the shit about one of the brewery's that he had info on, to the waiter who scooted in with the ladies next to us when taking their orders \"so I don't have my butt all in anyone's face\". The atmosphere is funky and filled with great pop art, but not so swank that i felt out of place in errand attire.  But enough about the frills, you care about the food right? We got a small edamame, which was by no means small ($4), and split three 8-piece Makimono: the spicy tuna roll ($7), the volcanic roll ($13) and the dynamite roll($13). All the fish was very fresh and generously cut. I'm curious to try their burgushi, which is a fusion of land ingredients and sushi form, or sushi ingredients and burger form, depending on what you pick. There was more than enough food to keep us both full until late in the evening, so you get what you pay for, but the menu does get a but pricey if you aren't bargain-conscious (read: cheap).  Cowfish is by all means a great sushi place to go for an occasional lunch treat or a special event, but I'm thinking for normal sushi nights, I might stick a little closer to home (and budget).",

All of his recommendations were spot on!   Tried the Doug's roll which is burgushi - excellent and something very new for me.   The Boss was also tasty- albeit a little pricey at $19 ( but expected for a higher quality sushi...not your take-out Japanese joint). I particularly liked the ponzu with this. The presentation was beautiful - fresh flowers and everything.    My absolute favorite was the tuna nachos - not your typical nacho but I would come back for this alone.   We opted out but on Sundays they have $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's, which was a great deal.   I felt that they really earned all 5 stars this time around!",

It's a very nice restaurant, love the theme, the bar, the area, the mood......but the sushi is just as bad as Eez, so I'll have to steer clear of that if I decide to return......I really want to like this place so I probably will return. The onion rings and crab rangoon dip were pretty good. The burger squirted me with grease as I bit into it, but it was rather tasty.  The drink menu is extensive and it would be great if the servers were able to sample the drinks to at least recommend a favorite or 2, but I understand they are forbidden to try drinks.....even on their off days.......with that said, I tried the Cheeky Monkey, pretty good but could have used a bit more pineapple juice.  3 stars overall, I'm quite disappointed in the sushi and the service seemed to want to rush you out.......",

    "text": "Honestly, the deciding factor to try The Cowfish last night was the fact that they serve food until midnight. With the time of our arrival being 11:30pm, I was not expecting the level of service and quality of the food to be as exceptional as it was. We arrived about 11:30 and were fed and happy and out by 12:05. Not even once did we feel rushed. The food came out quickly and it was very tasty.  Every interaction with the staff there was exceptional. Our server explained the menu and made great recommendations. From the time we walked in until the time we left, we felt welcomed. Everyone was so friendly. And our drink glasses never got empty. They were on top of our refills before we realized that we were close to being out.   Many places bill themselves as \"Asian Fusion\", but this place truly pushes the \"fusion\" boundary and explores some fantastic combinations. We found that (unlike many places) the more complicated the sushi/burgushi, the more delicious it was. Be forewarned that each roll is very large. One roll will fill you up easily.   Here is the run-down of what we ordered: Sweet & Spicy Pork Potstickers : Slightly spicy balanced with a slightly sweet peanuty sauce. Different and delicious.  The Taste Explosion : It's like a great burger in sushi form. This was one of our favorites.  The Boss: This was a complicated roll that was fabulous.  Spider Roll: very delicious, the crab was cooked perfectly.  Spicy Tuna Roll: large roll, simple and wonderful.  Needless to say, we ordered waaaaaaay too much. We just had the leftovers for lunch and they are still delicious!   We will definitely be going back soon to try the items on the \"Burger\" side of the menu.",

By the way FABULIUS PLACE EXCELLENT CONCEPT ITS GENIUS I TELL YA!!!    However, the managment made a critical mistake thye were so worried about packing the people in but didnt worry abut or think about the service and the manpower cna sustain the people thye packed into the plae so my service was HORRIBLE..  Which was a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. Never the less I thik since they are almost over there opening stages and got all the kinks out I am defitnely willing to go back and give it another try because honestly they shouldnt worry abut people not coming ot the establishment I mean come on this menu is GENIUS!!    One thing that I thought that was funny and annoying at he same time was the restroom would play a CD of random quotes from different languages. its pretty funny.  Ok off of my side note now on to the food.   1. Sushi:  AMAZING..  However I feel they need to have more traditional sushi not this americanized CRSP with jalapenos and cream cheese its gross to be honest but whatever to each their own right?    2. Burgers: Awesome!  The jalapeno bacon they put on the burgers are really cool and tasty.    3. Drinks: Good wish they had al ittle kick to them but I like ,my drinks strong though.",

Cowfish has an awesome feature where they will text you when your table is ready so you can explore the expansive South Park Mall it is located next to.  On my first and only visit I had a bison burger with sweet potato fries.  I was impressed with the quality of both items and with the variety of toppings available for burgers.  Others in my party ordered Bento Boxes and sushi.  The Bento Box looked awesome and had a unique variety of items.  The sushi looked and tasted awesome but is definitely overpriced.    We went (and you should go) on a Thursday for half-price sake.  We split several carafes and also each did a sake bomb which is always a good time.  I will definitely be back to Cowfish.",

    "text": "This review is for Sushi only. Personally if I go to a sushi bar I wont order anything but sushi. The person next to me did have some kind of burger and it was huge and looked really good. If your a sushi lover and If you have ever been to EEZ fusion in Birkdale village(SAME OWNERS) and enjoyed it then you will love Cowfish. The sushi at Cowfish and EEZ is the best around. They have the freshest sashimi and the biggest and tastiest rolls. In addition to the sushi you have to try the crab rangoon dip. The dip may actually be better than eating a crab rangoon itself. They drizzle a special sauce over the fried wontons to start and you can eat the wontons plain the sauce is so good. There sushi bar is pretty cool as well. They have screens on the bar that you can play all kinds of games.   I could really care less but the only drawbacks about the restaurant is that the bathrooms are extremely small. One bathroom is for only one person at a time. The parking is a bit limited as well. Unless your lucky and find a spot in front of the restaurant you will have to park in the garage. The garage is about a block away. They do have some good sake's. If you a sake enthusiast however then the sake list seems a bit more limited then what EEZ carries. But for being in a new area like South Park the list may grow as they develop and learn the clientel that will come in.",

    "text": "I would have given Cowfish 5 stars, but the wait was almost unbearable! A friend of mine had asked to go to Cowfish for her birthday.  We tried going once before, but the wait was so long we ended up turning in our buzzer and eating else where.  This was a Tuesday evening and yet it was still packed! I didn't make reservations because I thought with it being a week day the wait would not be as long......epic fail! We were told the wait would be any where between an hour and an hour and a half! We actually ended up waiting and hour......so my suggestion is to MAKE reservations!   Once we got in, the electric atmosphere quickly helps you forget about the long wait.  If it's just you and a date, you can always ask to be let in and sit at the bar, but for that extra special feeling, I would suggest getting a table.  My date and I were seated at a small cramped table in the corner.  Our waiter Mike was very pleasant and efficient.  I ordered the Bagel roll, and an appetizer of Chicken Satay.  The bagel roll is great fro those who can only take so much sushi.  It's lightly cooked salmon, rice, cucumber rolled in rice and covered in sesame seeds.  The Chicken satay is great....the best thing about it is the celery salad/garnish that it comes with.  The celery is cut into fine slices and there is a vinaigrette spread over it....delicious!  The service was so fast....we got our  sushi rolls, prior to our appetizers, but no complaints here!  All in all, the Cowfish is an interesting spot, definitely a date destination.  From the cool decor, tasty food, to the weirs Rosetta Stone language lesson that plays in the bathroom......the Cowfish is one of a kind!",

Their menu is huge so if you're a fan of burgers, sushi, salad or even milkshakes, then you'll be set.  The \"Burgushi\" bento box selection is usually my go-to as you can sample a small sushi roll, a slider-size burger, and sides (sweet potato fries, edamame, and cucumbers). They even have 3 selections of bentos.  This visit I tried the all-jalapeno everything burger. A pretty good sized burger, tasty, and mine was cooked the way I wanted it, but my friend's slider was way too pink for the medium-well she requested. Must be tougher on smaller burgers without overdoing it.  I would return to share the experience with guests, but for the price you can go to a better place that specializes specifically on burgers or one specifically for sushi.",

On my third attempt, I went in March 2014 on a Friday afternoon around 2:00 and there was still at least a 20 minute wait. I chose to wait since I was a meeting a friend and had already completed my errands in the mall.  As you wait, you can watch your name inch up to the top of the list on a large projection screen that's supposed to simulate a fish tank and you also get sent a text.  I ordered the neon dion roll and was very happy with the flavors and taste. My friend ordered the bento box that included a slider (of her choice), sushi roll, cucumber salad, and other sides. Personally, I thought the bento box really gives you a bigger 'bang' for your buck and the cucumber salad is delicious!",

The food was great, the prices are a bit on the high side for the amount of food you get. I got the mushroom Swiss burger with fries, $15 is a bit steep for the size and amount of fries. Others in my party both got the bento box, the portions of everything was a bit small for the high price, and the mini burgers were over cooked. Other than that we were very satisfied, the menu is huge! Will go back!",

After listing my daughter's allergies to the server, together we were able to figure out what to order for her. My husband's and my food came out first. We were told our daughter's food would come out shortly after. It came out a few minutes later as promised, but by the chef himself, who explained to us how it was cooked to ensure that no cross-contamination happened. There was even a tag on her tray that said \"allergy,\" so that extra caution could take place. That was something that we really appreciated and don't take lightly! Thank you Cowfish",

On the sushi side, this is so far the best sushi restaurant in Charlotte (having been here about 2 years and having tried many). Fish taste great and properly sliced, and the chef inventions (ie specialty rolls) are interesting and tasty.   On the burger side, properly cooked, a good variety of options (incl meat), makes this restaurant beating many burger-only restaurants available all over Charlotte.",

It came as a pleasant surprise that Cowfish manages to serve both and do it well.  We had a little of everything for our table.  The kids had mini burgers and, as a mom, two big thumbs up for a kids menu that includes apples, carrots and other not just french fry items.  They ate it all and loved it.  The edamame has a variety of salt options, I like the smoked salt, my husband prefered the sriacha and the kids liked the plain salt best.  The crab Rangoon dip was very good.  My husband opted for the nature boy roll, he liked it and the Jim Beam shake.  I had a bento box with the firecracker roll. It was almost too much food.    A fun spot and when the weather is warm they have patio games such as corn hole out.    Last suggestion: go early or get a reservation.  We arrived at 5:30 and were seated quickly.  By the time we left there was an hour wait.",

First off it's just a really cute place. Make sure to look at the artwork and have a good laugh. Also go to the bathroom. Just do it. ;)  Staff- I've been here 3 times so far and they have yet to dissapoint. Last night I was there for Humm almost 4 hours (good thing it was a slow Monday night or else I would have felt bad). Our waiter was great, joked around a little, gave us his 2 cents on the menu, and let us continue to sit there and drink without being pushy. He did have to leave and someone else took over but she was very nice too and kept the drinks coming. All I remember is Moscow something. GET THAT DRINK!  Food was excellent! You cannot go wrong mixing sushi and beef together. I cannot wait to try more of their menu. My date had a burger.... little boring but we won't hold that against him.  All in all this place is a must. Do resist the urge to go any longer.",

    "text": "Sushi and burgers prepared exactly the way you want?  Yes, please!  This concept seems a little confused at first glance but turns out to be pretty darned ingenious!  Cowfish gets 4.5 stars (I'm rounding down because my order on my first visit was disappointing) for delicious food, generous portions, limitless variety, great ambiance and excellent service.  I have been twice in one week since discovering it.   TIP: They're located on The Residences side of Southpark Mall so park in the adjacent parking structure for ease; trying to hunt down a spot right in the front of the restaurant is a futile exercise.  Fun ambiance, family-friendly.  Dining inside the restaurant, you have a selection of high tops or semi-booths and a view of the saltwater aquarium; otherwise, you can sit on their patio, which is sprinkled with strategically placed fans and heaters.  Just off the patio is a large fountain and relatively large lawn where I have seen kids sprawled about.  We have opted for the patio both times that we came; it's a serene way to enjoy an outdoor meal.  Excellent service.  We have been on a late Saturday afternoon when they were relatively busy and a Sunday afternoon, when it was pretty quiet.  Albeit, the Sunday service was much more attentive, but it could be a result of a different server.  The first time we came, our server was good but not memorable.  However, on our second visit, Shelley really went above and beyond to ensure that we had everything that we needed and that our dining experience was delightful.  We ended up ordering more than we could eat in one sitting and she painstakingly made sure that each sauce that accompanied our meal was packed accordingly.  Limitless variety.  Their menu is expansive (it's literally several pages long; not quite as long as Cheesecake Factory but it's in that league) but the great thing is that everything is fully customizable; it's always disappointing when you see \"no modifications or no substitutions\" on a menu so kudos to them for encouraging you to ask for exactly what you want, how you want it.    Delicious food.  Their portions are very generous so for those of you who, like me, have bigger eyes than your stomachs, take heed.  It's not necessarily that the food is innovative or complex, it's more that the food is very flavorful and well prepared.  Note that they do use imitation crab. I've had:  ________________DELICIOUS: +++  rock shrimp.  The shrimp is perfectly crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside.  The very creamy sauce has just the right balance of spiciness and sweetness.  It's served on a bed of lettuce, cabbages and cucumbers. +++  seared sesame tuna.  The tuna is extremely fresh with no fishiness to it whatsoever.  It is served on a bed of seaweed salad and cucumbers, which is sprinkled with a ginger citrus sauce that is seriously divine.  I brought this home; it was still delicious the next day. +++  minis of the week.  We added cheese and pickles to ours.  The angus beef is juicy, even in this compact size.  But the Cowfish sauce is what makes this amazing.  It's reminiscent of Thousand Island but is much thicker and sweeter.  I thought this was delicious and I don't really care for burgers much. +++  beef bare burger.  This burger was outstanding.  The juiciness of the beef, the Cowfish sauce, it was just a stellar burger.  Did I mention that I don't like burgers??  The fries were also flavorful and yummy. +++  Mark's roll.  This roll has tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, Kano, scallions and is flash fried.  It is topped with mayo and sriracha but a little bit of masago; a great crunch roll and not spicy at all.  The ponzu dipping sauce was absolutely fantastic. _______________GOOD: +++  yellowtail.  My BF is obsessed with Zuma, his all-time favorite restaurant chain and their yellowtail is one of the things he craves.  He's always on the hunt for a second runner up.  The jalapeno and ponzu sauce are reminiscent but the cut of the yellowtail is too thick (they give you probably 3-4 times more than Zuma does) but I recommended that next time, he ask for tempura flakes or onion rings to add the Zuma crunch factor.  In not comparing it to anything, I thought it was great. +++  tropical storm roll.  This roll is kind of a rainbow roll (CA, with fish on top), sprinkled with eel sauce but the thick yuzu dipping sauce just takes it to the next level. _______________SKIP: +++  lobster and crab spring rolls.  The spring roll is a misnomer because it's fried and there is just way too much flakey egg roll on the outside.  If they reinvented this in traditional non-fried rice paper, this may be a winner. +++  Dion's OMG roll.  More like OMG I shouldn't have ordered a roll with coconut in it.  On our third trip on a Saturday afternoon, the service was mediocre; not stellar, not bad. The food was just as good as the other times so they're consistent there.  Overall, we will be back for the burger | sushi combo when we crave a little of both.",

    "text": "Finally made it to the Cowfish with my dinner group and I was not disappointed.  This is a interesting concept for a restaurant. Burgers and Sushi.  Who would have thought that such a combination would be so popular.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night.  Anyway, this was also my first time in trying raw sushi.      Before my sushi roll came out, one of my table mates received theirs first which was a spicy tuna roll and I was offered a taste.  This was wonderful  Great flavors!  Why the heck did I wait so long to try sushi.  My roll came out in a few minutes.  It was the double salmon roll and while it was good, it didn't compare to the spicy tuna roll.  So now I know at least one kind of sushi to try again,  For the burger, I went with the Pesto Turkey burger which was huge and looked appetizing when it arrived.  The flavors were good but the burger was a little dry.    For desert, I was a little disappointed with the dessert menu.  I guess I was thinking there was going to be something creative like a dessert made to look like a sushi roll but instead I found cheesecake, chocolate cake and similar desserts.   The only dessert with an asian flair were fried apple wontons.  But to go with the burger side they also had milkshakes so three of us opted for those.  The strawberry milkshake came with fresh strawberries and I ordered the grasshopper milkshake which had the right amount of mint and chocolate.  Service here was spot on.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful in explaining the menu and after offered no resistance when we asked to have our check split after receiving it.  Each of our bills was right the first time.   I think next time I'll just do the sushi here.  The burger/sushi combo was definitely too much.  But this was a fantastic place to try sushi for the first time.  #500!",

    "text": "Pretty easily my favorite restaurant in charlotte. Most gourmet burger joints I've tried have focused too much on fancy toppings, but the basics suffer. They get it right here. The burgers are unbelievably good. I recommend the bison burger, granny's southern pimento cheese burger, and the cowfish has left the building burger. The truffle cheese fries are great, but the sweet potato fries with dipping sauce are truly a standout. Their sushi is fresh and delicious, and their innovative burgushi is shockingly delicious. It's a big menu, but you honestly really can't go wrong.",

    "text": "So unique!  We decided to try The Cowfish after a day of shopping at Southpark.  It was a week night and wasn't too crowded - we sat on the heated patio.  Blood sugar levels were low and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs (that's always my excuse) so we ordered a couple rolls and apps.  The sweet & spicy cucumbers, the crab Rangoon dip (o.m.g). I was hooked.  We ended up getting a few items to go as well since we were headed back to Cola and wanted to enjoy more cowfish the following day.  Tab was well over $100 which was expected  - tip was over 30% because our server did an excellent job of accommodating us.  Anyway, a few days pass and we notice the debited amount was $100 more than we'd signed for... A call to the manager was immediately made, he took our info, asked when we dined in and said he'd look into it and get back to us ASAP.  One of the owners called us shortly thereafter, he was super apologetic, he reversed and updated the charge (which was all we really wanted) and offered us a free app and 2 free entrees the next time we came in.  He emailed us personally confirming his offer.  We were eager to return not only because of the free food but because of the EXCELLENT customer service.  The owners and management actually care.  It was that \"lagniappe\" (and of course food) that makes Cowfish one of my favorites!!!!",

We had about a 10-minute wait for a table, but it was easy to get a drink at the bar while we waited.   The sake taster flights were excellent. The menu is not very vegetarian friendly, without making a lot of substitutes. My husband loved his veggie burger. I tried it, and it was actually one of the best house-made veggie burgers I've tried in a long while. One of our friends ordered the bento plate, which includes sushi, sliders, and sides. His food was good, but the burgers and fries were not very warm. I tried the quinoa mushroom sushi roll. The flavors were fine, but it was extremely dry. The roll itself was salty, so drowning it in soy sauce to add moisture was not an option.They sang happy birthday to my husband and provided a massive piece of chocolate cake, which was complimentary. The cake was surprisingly flavorful.   When we're hosting carnivorous friends and family, we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Yet another great Charlotte restaurant I'm not sure why I've yet to review. As a sushi aficionado the Cowfish is an obvious choice. They've taken it upon themselves to lead the fusion charge in a seriously unexpected direction by mixing the delicious creatures of the land and sea in one meal for us to delight in. Well, at the time of this review I suppose it's safe to say most fusion sushi joints have pretty much joined the \"let's add beef to our sushi\" bandwagon. But as far as I'm concerned, not only was The Cowfish first, but it still stands in my mind as the best.  First off, there's getting in here. You've essentially gotta reserve a table. Don't walk up thinking \"I've heard of this pace and have to check it out, I'll go in!\" You will be hard pressed to find a table or even a spot at the bar on most nights. They book up quick and keep a waiting line out the door in most cases. It's all for good reason. There is an experience point to the place as well you know. Interior layout and decor is great. Comical actually, especially if you read a little Japanese and are familiar with the culture. The posters specifically are entertaining. Also, don't forget to take a trip to the restroom while you're here. You can relieve yourself to the sounds of random phrases spoken in English then in Chinese. It's...seriously random. They aren't even useful phrases. You'd pee yourself laughing if you weren't already peeing.  Service has been stellar in my experience so far. I've accompanied plenty of out-of-towners here and anytime somebody in the party hasn't been here before the waitstaff gives you a rundown of the menu, lots of recommendations and generally what to expect when you read the word \"burgushi\". This is great considering the menu is margin-to-margin on most pages and never-ending with options. I'm a sushi guy so naturally I gravitate towards the burgushi options. Surf 'n Turf is my personal go to favorite. It's like comfort food at the end of a long week. Angus beef tops a roll filled with salmon, tuna and cream cheese flash fried to the perfect texture. Or try the Lamb-urgushi. The name alone is funny enough to make you do it.  They've got a full bar that basically wraps around 3/4 of the restaurant. No small part of that is a sushi bar and half of the bar-top is laden with built in touchable gaming screens with lots to choose from. Outdoor seating abound for the warmer days and enclosed outdoor seating for the cold and wet days. If you're passing through, check it out, but if you live here you owe it to yourself as a Charlottean to come here at least once.",

We luckily found seats within 10 minutes at the bar. Unfortunately, it turns out we just should have waited for a table after all. We had to ask to order drinks, we had to ask to order an appetizer (which in fact was forgotten about), we had to ask to order our meals and we waited over ten minutes for a second round on our drinks, which we of course, had to ask to order. Use patience and just get a table instead of sitting through this disaster.",

Yes, this place had a very interesting, borderline weird menu, but that actually makes me happy and excited to try something new!  I went for flat out the specialty of the place (or uniqueness) the burgushi. I had the Surf and Turf and loved it, by far my favorite. I also tried the Nature Boy's (etc.) roll and that was just ok for me. The rolls were huge be warned, the combinations are nothing but interesting the staff was very nice and more than willing to help you navigate the substantial menu.

I'm not a diner that enjoys kitsch - I don't like cutesy-wootsy ambiance or clever decor. I just want a great meal in a clean establishment. It was our anniversary and so even though we have a fabulous more reasonable (and better) sushi place we made the hike to South Park to try The Cowfish. Why not do something special?  The meal was okay. The service was excellent considering the place was packed. I didn't really like the menu - it was way too big like almost as large as The Cheesecake Factory. I thought the food was uninspired - too many sauces and dips and crazy complicated dishes that almost always seem to mask ingredients that aren't that fresh. The menu reflected a lack of focus - what was this place - was it a burger joint or a sushi place? I found it mildly irritating. We had the crab rangoon dip and a fusion bento box for each of us. When our bento boxes were brought out the first thing I said was they could have at least given us two sliders.    The food was good but not fantastic and definitely not worth the 58 dollars we paid for lunch.   I recommend this place for people who want to eat sushi but everyone else in your party wants a burger.   Otherwise stick to your favorite local sushi place.",

As always, I checked with Yelp to find a great lunch spot.  And as always, y'all delivered!    I thought it might be super crowded at 12:30 on Sunday due to the Panthers football game.  Apparently everyone is AT the game because the place was only about half full.  I must have been early because by the time i left around 1:30 there was a wait.    The gal who opened the door for me as well as the guy at the host stand were both super friendly.  I told them it was my first visit and I was looking for a great sushi roll.  They provided several recommendations, all which looked fantastic.    My server was Leanna.  I give her a shout out because she was BEYOND nice and attentive.  A Los Angeleno could get used to this kind of southern friendliness!    I ordered a Mark's Roll sans jalapeno.  It was delicious, ranks at the top of my all-time favorite roll list.  I didn't try anything else, but all the food around me looked fantastic.    At the end of the meal the service manager stopped by (I'm sorry, forgot her name).  Another super nice gal who said their main source of business is word of mouth and sites like Yelp.  A restaurant that survives mainly by word of mouth just HAS to be good!    I could go on and on but I won't .  Suffice it to say if I livedin Charlotte I'd be a regular at Cowfish like Norm at Cheers.   Enjoy!",

That's right, why choose between getting fish or getting beef? Get the best of both worlds!  I added two pieces of yellowtail sashimi to my burger and it was a great combo...that is a rare opportunity to get together.  The environment is good too, especially for kids (and the young at heart) with interactive games and video material built into the bar.  Great staff too.  The fries were no good, and the immovable bar stools meant that the three people in my group could barely hear each other without leaning over A LOT (which is not comfortable and impossible to do while eating).  Those things keep it from being perfect, but I would not hesitate to come here again.",

    "text": "We were in on Sunday- again sat at the bar. Right after our food came out a guy came and hovered over us and asked us to \"scoot\" down a seat so he and his family could sit together and watch the soccer match. Normally this wouldn't be a huge deal but like I said- we just got our food and I didn't want to move- I wanted to eat my burger darnit! He clearly wasn't moving so we went ahead and made the move.   The female bartender (again, wish I could remember her name!) could see we were agitated and went and spoke to the manager who came over and thanked us for moving and gave us 2 free appetizer cards to use on our next visit. I thought this was a nice touch considering it wasn't something the restaurant caused.   I was already in love with the ambiance and food but this really sealed the deal for making this my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Already looking at the menu online an trying to decide what app I am going to order next time I am there!",

The first time I went, I accidentally ordered a roll that had shellfish and didn't know it as I am allergic. The waiter noticed I wasn't eating and I didn't say anything because it was my fault. They offered me to substitute which was very nice being it was not their fault by any means.  As for the food, the burgers are unique, I think the actual burgers are ok but the flavors they add are what makes them. Their truffle fries are amazing and highly recommend. The onion rings are also good but different, they have a little sweetness due to the coconut they use in the batter. I normally don't like coconut but these were really good.  As for sushi my husband loves the marks roll and I like the build you own due to my allergies and being picky. The sushi I have had has been very good.  My favorite item are the spiked shakes, love them! Highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Burgers?  And sushi?  In the same restaurant?  Whoa - what an amazing concept!  Seriously, this place just might be heaven.  Or a very close, very busy facsimile.  Either way, despite its flaws, I love the Cowfish.    This place, apparently, is almost always busy.  We came here on a Sunday afternoon at like 3:30, and we still had to wait 25 minutes for a table.  Apparently lunch doesn't end until 4:00, which we didn't know, but we got seated just in time to get served \"lunch\" (which was a total hurray moment for us).  Once we got seated, everything was smooth sailing.  Well, sort of.  The biggest problem was narrowing down the plentiful menu to decide what we wanted.  We finally decided to order the coconut battered onion rings.  I have to say, these were pretty darn tasty, and the sweet chili sauce with it was pretty yummy as well (my partner says the same thing about the wasabi aioli, but I'm not a horseradish person).  Unfortunately, these would have been better had we gotten them as an actual appetizer, but the kitchen was backed up and we didn't get them until after we'd gotten our entrees.  Still, they were delish.  We decided we both wanted burgers and sushi, but we couldn't decide if we wanted one of their lunch bentos.  We decided to get a sushi combo and burger separately, and then we split them.  We decided to get the Arnold Hamandegger, which was pretty good.  The meat in the burger was very moist and flavorful, but the overall burger was not as impressive as the patty itself.  We also decided to get the Spicy Crunchy Roll combo, which was pretty good as well (although not very spicy).  I decided to add some sriracha to the rolls, and they were really good.  The fish in the roll was awesome, but again, the overall roll was not as impressive.  Their sides are superbly delicious.  I had the sweet and spicy Thai cucumbers, which were very delicious and just the right level of spiciness.  I also had the edamame, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned to bring out their awesome buttery flavor.    Additionally, they offer some really wonderful sounding drinks and dessert, but we did not get any.  Next trip I will definitely have to try some of that.  Service was pretty good, with the exception of getting our appetizer late.  Our server was attentive and nice, so I can't complain (it wasn't her fault anyway).  They do have a pretty big waiting area, and you can also sit around the bar.   Parking does not seem like a problem; while you can't always find a spot in that plaza, there is plenty of mall parking very close, so you don't have to walk too far.  The decor is bright and fun, but it tends to be very loud in there.  I could barely near my partner talking, and he sat right in front of me at the table.  As far as prices go, they are a little pricey, but you also get quality food for your money.  You can expect to pay about $10-15 per person at lunch time, and more like $15-25 per person at dinner time, depending on what you order (not including drinks or dessert).  If you come here before dinner time, you can make a reservation, in case you don't want to wait.  They take reservations every day from 11-6, which seems pretty helpful if you like to eat early, but you still have long waits if you want to eat at a later time.  All in all, this place has good ingredients, good food, and good service.  However, expect it will probably be busy and loud, even if you go at an \"off\" time.",

    "text": "In my attempt to give this particular restaurant a fair shot, I thought I would give it a few rounds so that I can give a fair review and CFSBB a better run for my money. My review is LONG so be prepared to read, however, I feel its important to give details because I waited more than one visit to give my FULL review. Mainly because I personally know of so many people that always rave about this place, WHY, is always my question. I can count a few other places i would prefer to go to before I go here. Not just because of the food but the service is not to par. Its not entirely inexpensive to go here and for what i pay here, i can give you a list of other places I would rather spend my time or money.  My first visit was during lunch service. There were not than many people and the waiter seemed friendly enough. The most pleasant part of my experience was having the ability to sit outside, but that can be said of a lot of restaurants down south, hell, Panera has a great outside area in Southpark too. The food was mediocre at best, I had sushi and this was almost two years ago but it was unmemorable enough to forget. The second time I went, same thing, lunch, waiter was friendly I tried a chicken sandwich, was just ok. Now this past weekend was my final straw to not go back. It's the holidays, its next to the mall and other higher end destination shopping, \"I get it\". That said, I took my sister out for a special bonding lunch. We walked in and the hostess was rude. I told her I would like a table for two and she said very rudely \"well it's a 30 minute wait\" as if it was going to deter me from still wanting to stay and eat, I tried to be as pleasant as possible to which I replied, \"no problem\". She seemed annoyed (?) and took my name.   Every seat at the bar was taken and most of the tables in sight were as well. No biggie, this will give me an opportunity to \"Hang Out\" with my sister to which I stood up from the window banquet to get us a drink at the bar...wait, all of the bartenders won't even give me eye contact?! So my sister finally flagged one of them down and we ordered a beverage. We waited the full 30 minutes before we were buzzed and then approached. We were escorted to the back area where I can plainly see there were a few four tops open and then the very back area where there is a plastic enclosed area where at least 6 other tables were fully open! What on earth?   So we sat down, happy to have a private conversation. A waitress came up to us acknowledging that we had our own drinks but that she wouldn't be OUR waitress that someone was settling into her shift so she wanted to make sure we at least had water and perhaps some appetizers, friendly and attentive enough. Well, our water comes but at this point, we are hungry, so we asked to order. We both ordered the Beneto boxes, but I personally ordered \"The Ultimate\" Brento Bento Box with the firecracker roll. An additional 20 minutes go by and our \"Official Waitress\" gets to us and takes another round of drinks, WHY not it's a Saturday afternoon. I can start to notice others around us whisper about the service and the amount of time its taking for everything. No biggie, I am having a beer and with great company so who cares. So where is my food? It took 30 minutes to get our bento boxes, I go in! The cucumber salad is delish, the edema me, well its damage ...either you like it or you don't but what is not to like?! The mini burger of the day is a sauteed mushroom with cheese and bacon, it's REALLY good actually. The Firecracker, was not particularly what I was expecting. It wasn't spicy and it was actually kind of bland. There is this man that clearly works there, he is wearing an ear piece, but he just keeps walking by really fast. He never makes eye contact, doesn't seem to make conversation with any of the patrons. My sister insists on ordering a dessert but my blue moon draft made me really full, so I passed. She tried the Apple Pie Wonton and didn't really like it. The waitress took note and asked this man that kept walking by  clearly if she could comp the dessert.... oh wait, he is a manager?????? He didn't' even look at her in the face while she asked, he seem to be in a rush to do another lap around the restaurant, talk about multitasking, working out while at work! It took longer than it should to get our check.   So long story short, I won't be back at cowfish. The service is terrible and management leads the herd. The end.",

    "text": "Our party of 4 arrived at 7:30 pm on a Thursday night and were promptly seated at a table in the front by the bar. There was no wait and only a few tables were full. A waitress came over and introduced herself, but listed off two other names of staff that would be helping out as well because they were all also behind the bar?? So clearly understaffed from the moment we sat down given they weren't busy at all. The next 2 hours (yes a simple dinner took 2 hours) consisted of at least 15/20 min between the time a person would stop at our table and we would then see no one. The food was pretty good and came out at a decent speed until we finished eating and moved to dessert. Almost 30 min for 2 milkshakes and cake to come. When it arrived a manager dropped off the lemon cake dessert with a bowl of vanilla ice cream that had melted into soup and made a joke about not charging for the dessert bc their freezer is broken and nobody realized it the whole night. This was a mildly concerning statement to us as we didn't know what food was kept in the freezer at a restaurant serving sushi. After no apology for the wait time, or empty waters and not being able to find a waitress, he then circled again and yelled out how's the soup as he passed laughing. I understand that some things are outside of control but the way the situation was handled was less than desirable. An apology for a 2 hour dining experience on a Thursday night in an empty restaurant would have been merited and instead we got jokes about melting food from the manager on duty.",

It was a busy Thursday but we only had to wait 30 minutes. The waiter was nice and timely. We ordered the R&R roll and the Foreplay roll. We were waiting on our food and we heard a loud gong and figure out that it was someone's birthday. I was rather wishing that they would go easy on the gong since it was a closed space but it didn't bother us too much.   The waiter brought out our order. The rolls were tightly made and nicely presented. What caught us both off guard was the initial bite. The rolls tasted amazing. The fish they used tasted very fresh along with all other ingredients. I would definitely recommend everyone I know to try this place. Next time I'd like to try the bento boxes.",

    "text": "Cowfish has been open for about 3 years & this place is still packed as ever! I've eaten here a number of times & DIDN'T have to wait only twice (one of those times was during lunch). It can get pricey, but the portions are big enough to last at least 2 meals (and no I'm not a \"dainty eater\"). I will go into more detail about my first two visits because we had very different experiences with the food.  VISIT #1  Our first visit was actually on our 1st anniversary. BF & I couldn't decide where to eat, but we remembered that Cowfish opened a couple of months before so we headed over. We were able to get seated right away, but it was at a less than desirable table (right by the door in January?? brrrrr!) BF wanted to move to another table, but I'd been a hostess for a number of years & know how annoying it can get when customers keep switching tables on you, so I told him to deal with it & stay at this table. We were a bit overwhelmed by the huge, 10+ page menu, but our server made a few recommendations for us. We started off with some Sticks, Sweets, & Strings (3 S's) and BF ended up getting 1 burgushi (Taste Explosion) & another fusion specialty I can't remember & I ended up getting NOT a burger, but a \"knife & forker\" entree of stuffed eggplant (I believe these aren't on the menu anymore) & a Vegetarian Roll.   The 3 S's were great! Copious portions of regular fries, sweet potato fries, & onion strings accompanied with a trio of dipping sauces.. artery-clogging goodness! I still get this on subsequent visits as well. BF liked his fusion specialty roll & thought the Taste Explosion roll was a bit odd, but at least he tried it! I wasn't really impressed with my eggplant but I guess that's partly my fault for ordering eggplant at a restaurant that specializes in burgers & sushi! However, my veggie roll was just alright, nothing special. It contained avocado, asparagus, & cucumber.. very basic stuff. We ordered the apple wontons for dessert & that was delish!  First visit we spent over $100 for a couple of drinks, 1 app, 2 entree-sized rolls, 1 knife & fork entree, a basic roll, & dessert and left pretty underwhelmed about the food. Service was exemplary, however. At the time, I probably would have given Cowfish a 2.5 rounded up to a 3. Good service & kinda pricey for ok food.  VISIT #2  My second visit was also with the BF. We went on his bday, a few months after our first visit. It was a Tuesday, & we were quoted a 30 minute wait, so BF gave them his phone number & we went to the mall to chill. After about 20 min, they gave him a call to let us know our table was ready.. but we still had to walk back to the restaurant from the mall so they held our table for us. We were seated at a much better table, away from the door.  I couldn't believe how packed it was on a Tuesday, but it must have been because of the half off 10 oz \"exotic\" martini special! You better believe I took advantage of that! I went with the Asian Orchid- raspberry sake, raspberry liqueur, and pineapple juice and also the Key Lime Pie- vanilla vodka, frangelico, fresh lime, & pineapple juice, with a graham cracker rim! Both martinis were excellent!  I had already looked at the menu beforehand so I already knew what I wanted. We started off with the 3 S's again & also the Chinese Chicken Salad without the chicken, cilantro, or green onion. This came with mixed greens, red & napa cabbage, bok choy, snow peas, red pepper, mandarin oranges, peanuts, carrot & beet curls, crispy wonton strips, & tossed in a peanut vinaigrette! It was pretty darn good, I must say! Big enough for both of us to share as well.   For my entree, I decided to play it safe & stick with a burger- the Heavenly Veggie to be more specific. This wasn't the generic, frozen black bean burger you get at other places. Their house made veggie patty had brown rice, panko, cranberries, quinoa, roasted corn, spinach, edamame, & red peppers! Definitely the most unique veggie patty I have ever tried. The burger was served on a wheat bun with spinach, red onion, roasted red peppers, & avocado.. I also added some pepperjack cheese, pepperoncinis, & got a side of BBQ sauce.. what a delicious, monster-sized creation! It came with a side as well, so I got some more of those crispy sweet potato fries. My burger fell apart about halfway through, so I had to eat the rest of it with a fork.. nbd. I ended up ditching the bun & eating just the patty & toppings.  Overall, we were more impressed with the food this time around & the service was just as great as before. Since we had a better experience the 2nd time, we still come here & I have even brought a few friends who were visiting from out of town & they loved the concept & the food. I have been thinking about trying one of the bento boxes lately so I will have to force myself to get it next time, instead of the veggie burger!  I absolutely loved the Counter & was sad to see it go, but Cowfish has taken a great thing & made it even better!",

I must preface this review by noting that I do NOT mind paying more money for a satisfying meal. I find their prices to be very reasonable, considering the quality and presentation of the food. For a MONSTROUS roll, and the best assortment of edamame I have ever consumed, my total bill was around $22-24.   If you love southern BBQ, as I have grown to love and crave, please try the deliverance roll. Pulled pork bbq is wrapped in the dried seaweed with rice and tempura onion straws, flash fried, and topped with bacon coleslaw and bbq sauce. Y'all have no idea how tasty this roll was! It was so tasty, in fact, that I had to throw a \"y'all\" in there!   Most importantly, every morsel of food tasted fresh and clean, as they made sure to not cross-contimaniate my non-raw roll with their cuts of raw fish. Very professional, very trendy, my entire experience was delightful!  The atmosphere is VERY eclectic without being too busy. The service was excellent, and I even left a great compliment on a comment card. I will return for more :-)",

Our waitress Lauren was great - she started us out with cocktails. Do yourself a favor and get the Snake in the Grass - nice strong drink with bold flavors - can't wait to try and recreate this at home - yum! The onion rings as an appetizer are some of the best we've ever shared - huge rings that were crunchy, not greasy. You could make a meal out of these alone. We ordered the mushroom roll and Mrs. Woodbury's roll - delicious and fresh. I'm already trying to figure out a trip back to Charlotte just to eat here. Just wish a few less people knew how great this place is :-)",

The first time I walked in, I didn't know what to expect.  I stopped by this place because I read an article about it.  I'm so happy I stumbled upon this article and tried it out!  The place is nicely decorated, with some cute little details.  Near the sushi bars, they have some aquariums and big sushi displays on the wall.  The food is so good I just don't know how to explain it.  You'll just have to go and experience the delicious explosion in your mouth.  I would recommend the crab rangoon dip for the appetizer.  You can't go wrong with that!  An entree that I find myself getting there a lot is the Alaskan \"Turkey\" Sandwich.  Always heaven in my mouth.  The place is awesome, and I just don't know what else to say other than people need to experience this place.  Grab your friends and go go go!",

    "text": "I love, love, love this restaurant!!! We live in Winston-Salem, but my husband and I make it a point to find excuses to come to Charlotte simply to eat here. I adore seafood and sushi... my husband, on the other hand, would be happy if all things that swim were eradicated from the planet (or at least the dinner table) so the burger options for him and the sushi options for me make us both happy. And while I've never tried the burgers, they look decadently delicious!  We've been here several times, and I'm sure the waitstaff is delighted when they hear they don't have to explain the weighty menu to oldtimers. Seriously, the menu is only slightly smaller than the Bible, and it can be a bit overwhelming and intimidating at first. Take a deep breath and relax and take your time with it; it's worth it.   My favorite appetizers are the crab rangoon dip (makes me drool just thinking about it), the lobster and crab spring rolls (pretty presentation!), and the avocado and ahi tuna-tini (could make this my meal all by itself).  I've created my own sushi rolls at times for an entree, but the crafted rolls on the menu are so delicious I usually just select something already created by the restaurant. One roll is enough for anyone other than perhaps sumo wrestlers... or my 15 year old.  The bento boxes are also a nice option since they offer a little bit of everything.  \"Burgushi\" is the Cowfish's term for a fusion of burgers and sushi, and this is a nice thing to try if you're not really into the raw fish thing (silly you). These \"sushi\" rolls incorporate a lot of filet mignon choices and/or cooked fish, bacon(!), lamb, pulled pork, etc, etc. I've never had one I didn't love.   The restaurant is a little loud, but it has a fun sort of industrial-vibe about it with interactive touchscreen menus at the bar and amusing, snarky paintings on the wall that will make you chuckle if you have any sense of humor at all.  There is a nice patio area in the back as well. The bar wraps around the entire restaurant and offers plenty of seating along with views of an amazing fish tank.   The owner of this restaurant is a Texas Longhorn... Hook 'em!!!!! (though I would eat here even if he was an Aggie). I haven't tried the Cowfish's new location in Raleigh yet, but that is about to be rectified in a couple of weeks. I've given up hoping any restaurant like this will open up in Winston-Salem/Greensboro.",

    "text": "Wife just flew in from an international trip.  We wanted to go somewhere different.  Although we have been here before, it had been a while.  We entered and sat at the bar. I had dropped my wife off first as I parked the car.  When I came in (about 5 minutes later) she was sitting at the bar and still not acknowledged.  I sat beside her and it was an additional 5 minutes before we were greeted.  Finally, a female bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  We also ordered an appetizer and told her we would order more later.     They were apparently at \"shift change\" and there was some sort of an issue between the male bartender coming on duty and the female going off duty.  The male was obviously aggravated as he slammed stuff around.  He cashed out a pair of guests beside us and slammed there credit cards around at the POS and basically threw them back to them for signatures.   After our app was finished and drinks empty for about 5 minutes, we were finally asked if we needed another round.  We ordered, and several minutes later, our drinks were delivered.   He then, quickly grabbed our menus away along with our plates before we could even attempt to order main course.  I finished my drink prior to my wife but just watched as both bartenders walked by us completely ignoring us.  Finally, I flagged one down to pay just to get the hell out.   Last time.  Over priced with substandard service.  Will spend money elsewhere in a better atmosphere with better customer service.  Highly disappointed.    **update** 1/24/17:  Within a day of posting this review, I received a msg from their Director of Guests relations, Jenny. We spoke this afternoon.  First, it was great to hear that this company is serious about customer service.  She apologized and reiterated that this is not what they want any customer to experience and they have addressed with the staff and will utilize as a focus in training.  She definitely restored our trust and we will be back to give Cowfish another try!  First time I have received such follow up on a review.   Very refreshing.",

The sushi is teriffic, the service quick and attentive, and the atmosphere lively and fun. My wife is much more of a sushi fan than I, but this is a restaurant we can both enjoy, with a diverse and eclectic menu, a great selection of drinks, and a spacious, comfortable patio. Sure, the wait can be a little long, but plan ahead, be patient, and you won't be disappointed.",

The presentation of the food was incredible, as pulled pork sushi rolls full of flavor surrounded a neatly stacked volcano made of delectable, tasty onion rings.  The service was fantastic, and the menu options are plentiful.  They give you a lot of food too, but yet it's not too much, because the food is delicious!  I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Charlotte!",

    "text": "OMG  Best restaurant discovery in Charlotte for years. I live sushi and I love burgers, never thought to eat them together but I am really happy Cowfish did!!  They nail the burgers, we had a variety of them at our table from made to order to some of the suggested combos on the menu.  Chipotle Bison and Lamb are incredible, perfectly cooked. Love that you can sub for these or turkey for any of their burgers. The build your own selections are numerous and super duper delicious.  I got a chipotle bison burger on a brioche bun with a coconut onion ring, sauteed mushrooms, truffle cheese, with a side of the codfish sauce, it was mouthwatering.  We also tried their novel concept of burgushi, which is burger associated foods incorporated with traditional sushi ingriedients.  We tried the taste of evolution roll subbing the beef for ground lamb and it blew the whole table away with how tasty it was.  We also tried one of their Asian Fusion rolls that included crab cakes and was baked at the end before serving, it was just as good.  Finally a place that marriesmy two favorite foods!  Oh yes, always ask for what their featured brews are, we had a local Foothills Heffeweisen (sp?) which was the perfect summer beer.  And have to give major props for our waiter Dennis for guiding us through the menu, being patient with our large party, surprising my aunt with an awesome birthday dessert, and looking out for the youngest at the table, my 7 month old baby.  Ask for Dennis when you go in.  Also Megan and Rachel the hostesses were also super nice pans helpful in getting us seated as soon as possible considering how busy they were!",

Overall, a pleasant dining experience for lunch with my family while on vacation in the Charlotte, NC area.",

Interesting combo of sushi and burger restaurant in upscale southpark mall complex Had cool decor, bar that goes around 3/4 of restaurant, on the pricier side but worth it!   Went there on a sunday night right after new years and the place was hopping! Had a 10-15min wait, sat at the bar and had a glass of wine- very good! We were seated in an outdoor area that was covered and had heaters. I feared i was going to be freezing temps were in the 30s but it was actually very warm. I would definaly go back in summer to enjoy the outside seating. Ordered 2 sushi rolls (8 pc each!!) and a filet migon burger. Amazing everything. Waitress was friendly and polite also a bonus  Downside- doesnt accept reservations ever after 6pm probably b/c they're always busy. Restaurant is large and bathrooms are only on one side so long walk around to get to them. sushi rolls had too much cream cheese in them and i loathe cream cheese. Never getting roll again with cream cheese again!",

I had the tasty explosion and a spicy tuna roll and both were great.  The fusion of burger and sushi was really cool.  Will def be back.  My waiter Trip, yes that was his name, was very friendly and was knowledgeable of the menu as it is quite different from anything you'll see at other restaurants.  I highly highly recommend the Burgushi portion of the menu.  You can go anywhere and get a good burger or sushi but to combine the two and do it so well, good luck finding that somewhere else. Be prepared for a fairly long wait if you come here on weekend night after 6.  The bar is first come first serve like usual so if your a party of two i recommend that for sure.",

As my entree, I had the filet and lobster roll... OMG.  This roll is perfection and it has truffle oil and just the right amount.  It is worth every penny of the $22 and is enough food to be your meal (I even had left overs).  The drinks were my only complaint tonight.  I had the cucumber martini which I usually love but tonight they weren't made the same and had a lot of seeds and mint leaves in them which was gross.  After dinner my friend and I ordered Malbec which almost made me sick; it wasn't kept at an appropriate temp.  I think it was just an off night for the beverages but the food was delicious as always.  My friend got the sashimi which tasted so fresh.  Honestly, this is better than anywhere we have in Atlanta.",

Luckily, people had just gotten up from the bar so Hubby and I saddled up and decided to chow down while we people watched.  He ordered the Backyard Burger and a Tempura Shrimp roll. He finished off his grande meal with a Jack Daniels Shake (I might have snuck a half-straw full for taste). He declared all three delicious. I ordered a Salmon Avocado roll and created my own. They brought all his food first. Then came my salmon roll and the create your own that I didn't actually order (they made it wrong) It took them 20 minutes to remake it (at 9:00pm really?). When it came I was barely hungry enough for it but tried to eat as much as I could. I left feeling way too stuffed.  The bill was what we expected, but this place is pretty pricey.

I got the fusion bento box which consist of the Mini burger of the day, 4 pc Nigiri Sushi, cucumber salad, edamame, and sweet potato fries. 16  The mini burger was definitely the star. everything else worked well together. I was really full by the end of the meal. Alas I have to get use to eating sushi and burgers at the same place. I prefer to have sushi night and burger night on separate days.",

I have had their binto boxes which I love when I can't decide if I want a burger or Sushi. My favorite so far is the  \"Mary Had A Little Lamb-urgushi Roll\" It's a perfect combination of natural ground seasoned lamb, kalamata olives, capers, feta cheese, red onions and spring mix rolled hosomaki style with soy paper and rice. Each piece is topped with tzatziki sauce, diced tomato, English cucumber, fried capers and fresh chopped mint. Simple Amazing.  And Wed they have 1/2 Price on all Bottles of Wine! Man, I'm now craving that dip again!",

It ends up being just an OK sushi place and an OK burger place. I wanted to try the best of both worlds so I ordered the bento box which came with a few sides which seemed like they were once frozen. The prices are up there which probably pays for the bar with the media touchscreen built into it. This place is great for a compromise if you're with someone or a group that is split on sushi and burgers however, in all honesty, you're better off finding a Chinese American buffet.",

Walking in, the place looked busy, especially for a weekday. Being all by myself, I was able to grab a seat by the bar. The bartender was warm and friendly, and helped me select a light wheat beer from their selection, which I thought was right up my alley. Next, I ordered the Nigiri Sashimi combo, and it was some really good sushi. The fish was fresh, and the sushi had a perfectly balanced flavor to it, to the extent that i didn't feel like spoiling it with soy or wasabi.  Overall, I had a great time and would definitely go back.",

There was no wait for a seat at the bar, you get a server if you sit at the sushi bar. Menu is huge, which is annoying. Scott was knowledgeable and personable. Suggested the Bento box which came with a mini burger and sushi. I love both, but if I'm in the mood for sushi, I don't want a burger and never the Twain shall meat, pun intended. He Gave me great suggestions, one of which was the Tuna nachos, which were delicious! Deep fried wonton wrapper with a dollop of crab Rangoon dip, perfectly seared ahi Tuna, guacamole, and microgreens. They give you lime to squeeze over which in my opinion brings it over the top. I ate the SHIT OUTTA THOSE!!I also ordered a simple tempura shrimp roll and server suggested avocado over the top. Why not? That came with a choice of a sauce. It was good, nothing spectacular. I specifically asked how big were the servings since it's only me and he made it sound like it wasn't a lot. I ended up wasting money and food. That pisses me off. Don't try to have me order more food by suggesting the servings aren't that big. That's not a bad thing, because that's great for groups, just stupid for one person. Manager came over once he knew I was a first time patron and gave me his card for 5 bucks off next time. That's cool. I'll come back again and this time, I'll order just ONE app.",

I sat outside on the patio with a co-worker of mine where we were greeted promptly by our server. I had never been before, but my co-worker had so he gave me a quick run down of the rather lengthy menu, but maggie I believe her name was, was very informative and was even nice enough to go out of her way to grab us some samples of a few sauces I was unsure of for my burger. She also was incredibly helpful with some beer choices too. Food came out relatively fast especially since the patio was packed which is always a nice surprise. Will definitely be coming back to try the sushi!",

Well upon arrival the hostess was working to seat a rather large party and we got pushed to the side so we opted to go to the bar. Once finding our spot at the bar the two bartenders ignored us for a couple minutes and finally the male bartender greeted us (I think his name was Gabriel?). After receiving our food the manager immediately came over to ask us how everything was (which was fantastic on his part, we greatly appreciated him checking on us). Although, halfway into our food our bartender was still not back and our drinks were almost gone. None of the bartenders really wanted to assist us and we could tell we were not wanted. After finishing our sushi we opted to leave because of the very poor service from the bartenders. We were super disappointed with the Charlotte location because the Raleigh location was excellent.  Update- We have been contacted by the director of marketing for Cowfish and are extremely satisfied with corporates customer service. The director of marketing was extremely apologetic and made up for our experience. We are very happy and will Be returning back! :)",

This location was very busy, but my boyfriend and I were able to sit at the bar and still enjoy. It took a while to get our food, but we sipped on a beer and enjoyed the busy atmosphere. I ordered a fusion bento box, which comes with your choice of sushi, sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, fresh edamame and a mini burger of the day. Everything was heavenly and you can't go wrong with your sushi choice. The mini burger was a double burger topped with mushroom, bacon and goat cheese. YUM! My boyfriend ordered the Mediterranean lamb burger, and boy was it tasty! The portion size was huge and the burger delightfully juicy. It was topped with fried goat cheese and it all melted in your mouth.   I'll have to say that the prices are a little high, but the food is totally worth it!

They use a fancy system to let you know how long the wait will be. They give you a buzzer and you can track your \"fish\" in an electronic aquarium on the screens in the bar or with a smartphone app. When the fish gets big, it gets caught and you get buzzed. We waited about an hour on a weeknight evening right around dinner time.   As I get older, I'm getting more turned off by fusion. Inspired by other cuisines, fine, but fusion? No, thank you. I should've gotten a plain old burger or plain old sushi, but I didn't. I got a fusion burger. It was bacon on tuna on a rice paper bun. I made a huge mistake. The bacon was good, the tuna was good, but that bun just fell apart and the combination was not great. The mousse dessert was delicious, though.   The restaurant and restrooms were clean. Server was nice and helpful. Accepts credit cards.",

I did not know so I tried it and feel in love.  So if you do not know, if you order the boursin burger, do not substitute the cheese.    My lady loves I think it is the dragon rolls, of course it is the most expensive sushi I believe and she has to get two order.  Its like $19.99 for 6 rolls, so she has to get two, its ridiculous.    Also love this place, because sometimes they will give you $5 off your next purchase, man boobs here they come, cause its a wrap.",

I didn't want to come here and not try sushi and a burger so that's what I had. I had the philly roll sushi and the jalapeno popper show stopper burger. I was a little worried the jalapeno burger may be a bit over powering but it wasn't. The flavors all worked nicely together. My wife had the veggie burger and it looked solid as well. Nice homemade patty but she said it lacked flavor (still very good though).  Between cowfish and cowbell, both my wife and I preferred cowbell. Both are solid restaurants though.

We had the crab Rangoon appetizer a bento box, surf and turf roll, lobster roll and burger roll.  All were unique and great.  Great bar, kid friendly, solid service.  I can't wait to go back and try more dishes on their extended menu.  Sorry I forgot to take pictures.",

    "text": "Cowfish is always a special treat! I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet. While I don't go here a lot, the few times I have, I've always left stuffed and really happy! There are a lot of restaurants popping up in Charlotte recently will a higher price point, and have left me thinking that the dollar amount is too high for the food and experience.   This isn't the case for Cowfish, while you're looking at 12-20 bucks for a sushi roll, I was happy with my meal and the price... Every time I've gone cheap on sushi it's left me disappointed. Expect to wait, anytime you come here. Usually 20 minutes on average, when you go on a week night or Sunday. On a nice night, you can grab a bench outside.  Col and I order the R&R, Dion and the BBQ/Burger roll. Everything was delicious and we had a TON of food. I would say, I like the normal sushi more, but the BBQ was good, just not what I was in the mood to eat. The rolls are large so, I think one person could actually be content with one roll.  Our server was good, friendly and speedy. Pro Tip: Order desert to go... You won't be disappointed.",

Great ambience. Friendly wait staff. Awesome food.  I shared a huge plate of loaded french fries with truffle oil with a friend. It was greatly good... But we could hardly make a dent in the plate. For the main event we ordered a couple of plates of Sushi to share... And we were not disappointed!!! We wanted to have dessert...but were too full to even make an attempt. Great place.

It's literally a burger rolled up in a sushi. I really liked it, SO thought it was weird. The really sushi like the shrimp tempura and Boss roll were amazing.   Overall, great food, the waitress was attentive and served us quickly. She explained the menu, which has so many different options it was nice to get some guidance!   The place is really nice, i really liked the fish tank which had many of the \"finding nemo\" fish! Saw Dory :)   It's definitely interesting to try the burger sushi's and I'd definitely go again! Also the milkshake was amazing!!!!",

I still love the sushi rolls with the double salmon being one of the tastiest.  I've tried several of the appetizers and they're all delicious!  We just had the crab rangoon dip today and it was wonderful!  Their desserts sound amazing but I'm always so full from the meal I haven't been able to try any.  The only thing I don't like about Cowfish is how busy it gets.  We just make it a rule to come for lunch so we miss all the dinner-time craziness.  I've heard talk of 2 hour waits in the evenings without reservations (including weekdays).  Hopefully the opening of their outdoor seating area will help cut down on the long line of hungry diners.  We sat outside today and it was pleasant even with the chilly temps.  It is completely enclosed with a tent and they have tall propane heaters for temp control.",

The concept is genius gourmet burgers & sushi.  The fusion dishes are one of a kind. I even saw a bento box served with sushi rolls and beef sliders - that rocks.   You no longer have to worry about where to go the next time your in the mood for sushi and your friend doesn't eat raw fish. This is the place.   Be prepared for a wait it was freakin packed last night. I sampled a pimento cheese slider and a very strange sushi with pesto, mozzarella and some other stuff. The burger was delicious - but this particular sushi was a little strange for me but unique I give them that.   I decided I was still hungry and with the crazy selection on the menu I just had to try a few more things. Ahi Tuna Nachos oh my gosh yes I will be coming back for these on a regular basis this appetizer was huge and.could definitely be a meal. Crab rangoon dip on top of wonton chips with guacamole and blackened rare ahi tuna come on people this was heaven. I also tried what we were told was the most popular roll on the menu the Marx roll it was tasty not my fav but the pieces were huge and it was all prepared very well.   Special thanks to our servers Kevin and Fallon (sorry I'm pretty good with names I hope that's right) you all were very patient and full of information always appreciated.",

We finally went in to try it out last week on Thursday. We ended up having to wait for over an hour to get a seat, but the food was well worth it! The service was extra fast too, our sushi came out in less than what seems like 10-15 minutes. Their sushi is the exact replica of Eez Fusion. Loved it!! The great thing about Cowfish Burger and Eez Fusion is that their sushi rolls are so HUGE you really only need to order one roll and will have to take two bites instead of one. But of course we always go overboard and order two rolls each. Although the bill is never exciting to look at the quality of the food was well worth it!!  We're going to try a burger next time and I'll be back to give my ratings on that! :)",

Although be aware that the nachos are not made in  the typical nachos style.  The tuna and other ingredients are served on large crispy wafers (6 on the plate).  For lunch we got \"Doug's Filet\" roll and \"The Boss\" roll.  Both were very good.  The Doug's roll is actually their \"Burgushi\" creation.  It has thinly sliced Filet Mignon on top of a regular sushi roll.  It was different but yummy.  The food presentation was lovely.  Take a look at the picture I posted!",

Trendy restaurant/bar with eccentric decorations, the sushi bar includes built in touch-screen computers with games and other apps--including a button for calling the waiter or a drink menu where you can touch-to-order your next drink.  DELICIOUS and creative burgers, you have to try them all! The sweet potato fries are heavenly, and of course--my favorite--you MUST try the Avocado Spring Rolls--the best appetizer they brought from Eez.  Lunch? Quick and inexpensive, they have a lunch menu which includes plates that have a slider and a sushi roll, served with your choice of sides and extras like edamame and salad.  You can't go wrong with any burger--but I recommend the pimento cheese burger... and get some of those fried jalapenos on the side along with those sweet potato fries. And don't forget your sushi, my favorite? The tropical storm--the classic rainbow roll gets an Eez makeover with beautiful presentation and HUGE flavor. You won't believe your eyes (or your tastebuds). Want an upgrade? Ask for the \"Hurricane.' You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.  And talk about outstanding service--Marcus, one of the owners, is simply wonderful and LOVES to interact with his customers. I love that there  is a survey with every check delivery about your experience--they want your feedback! They really do listen!",

    "text": "My husband had visited Cowfish once and helpfully warned me that the menu was bordering on bible-length, so I did us all a favor and studied up before coming. We came at 5:30 on a Sunday night and while it was not yet slammed, I could tell that it was about to get crazy. What tipped me off? Wait for it...  Our server gave us outstanding recommendations- I ordered the ahi nachos (slathered with their insanely good crab rangoon dip) and the Firecracker Roll (tempura shrimp and kani with raw fish on top and ponzu sauce), my husband had the bento box with Mark's roll (deep-fried tuna roll with jalapenos and cream sauce). I love sushi, I've spent many years and countless dollars in pursuit of sushi deliciousness. So many places try very hard to be inventive with their sushi menus- Cowfish was successful. Everything we had was excellent quality, generous in portion, and fun. I do think they could make everyone's life easier and cut 25% of their menu off (at least!)- I seriously wonder if this contributes to the long wait times. But overall, food is killer.  Our server, though great with suggestions, beverage refills, etc gave me the worst feeling from the second we sat down that we wanted us to hurry up, eat, and leave. Or possibly he was just tragically over-caffinated. The impression that he wanted us to leave was heightened by the bizarre move of taking the empty beverage glass and replacing it with TWO full glasses of lemonade. That is just weird, dude. I should note that we sat down and ordered almost immediately and didn't linger in the slightest- mostly because I felt that he might freak if we did. Kidding. We had to leave for a movie.  So in parting, LOVE Cowfish food. Can't wait to eat it again. Servers might want to mellow out slightly.",

The appetizer we ordered with French fries, sweet potato fries,  and I think onion straws was good.  Unfortunately those were the highlights of the meal. I was forewarned that the veg sushi does not sell well. I now know why. I had the vegan sushi and I could not even find the mushrooms that were supposed to be in there. It was bland and boring. The warm sake the waiter recommended wasn't great either. I can't recall which sushi my friend ordered but she was sorry she didn't choose a burger instead. I can't recommend this place to other veggies. I won't be back.",

When I arrived today I was greeted at the door by one of the owners. He gave attention to making sure I was taken care of. He didn't hand me off to a host or server. I felt valued as a customer. So I have a very good impression of this establishment. The service here is top notch in my opinion, especially from the beautiful humans working behind the bar. The Cowfish, a modern sushi restaurant,  has a large variety of food options involving sushi and other meat options, and options for vegetarians. I've not eaten one yet, but the sushi burgers and rolls are the big deal here. Sushi burgers. Very interesting. I'm a low carb foodie so I doubt I will venture out to try one.  This place is a must visit.",

We arrived on a Saturday evening and put our name on the wait list, and was told by host it would be 30-35 minute wait. While we were walking away, we noticed a gentleman come up to other hostess and said he has reservations at that time and was taken inside... (thought there were no reservations..whatever). Friends and I walked around the area until our wait was over, when we came back 30 minutes later, the host told us that our wait was now an hour long! So I'm assuming they let people in the door regardless of the wait list. After a talk with the manager, who was very friendly, we only waited a few more minutes, and one of the hostess kindly brought us some waters while we waited outside.  My advice: go when they are not busy! And don't walk away during your wait or you may not get it.",

The boyfriend and I recently moved to Charlotte and Cowfish was very high on our list of places to checkout. We love burgers and we really love sushi... So, how could we not love Cowfish?! We hit them for lunch after a day of house hunting. We hit them at an off time (2pm), so there was no wait! It was gorgeous out, so we sat on the patio. Our server, Ellie, was really sweet and attentive. For food, we ordered the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Burgushi and the Rainbow Roll lunch combo. I was thoroughly amused and impressed with the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon. I could see how some people would be put off by the combo, but I loved it! The \"bun\" utilized soy paper, krab meat (yes...crab with a \"k\") and sushi rice. A super inventive combo that worked for me! The tuna was seared perfectly to a super rare... I can't stand over cooked tuna! Which paired well with the crisp bacon. The flavor of the ingredients and textures complemented each other well. It was surprisingly entertaining to eat. I deem it crave-worthy! It comes with a side, we opted for sweet potato fries. Some of the best I've ever had! The rainbow roll was solid. Not life changing, but well endowed with fish that was very fresh. Since it was lunch, it came with a side as well. We opted for edamame, which was perfectly steamed and lightly salted.   I really enjoyed Cowfish and I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

I called early on Sat around lunch requesting a reservation that evening. I was told they had reached their reservation capacity. The story is they only allow about two thirds of the inside and outside tables for reservations so they can accomodate walk-ins. While that may be True it still feels like they make you wait so you can stimulate their bar business. They were successful with our party of five.  We got there at 830p and were seated at 1030p. By that time, half the restaurant was empty.  The inside tables were closing down so they seated us on the patio. It was only about 85 degrees.   They did have a guy singing and playing which was cool, mostly covers and we were all impressed that he would attempt...'Don't Stop Belivin' by Journey.  We all had Sushi...it was good...not stellar or exceptional but good. I had the Chef's Nirvana platter, mosty everyone else had the LaVa platter.  It was fresh and tasty and out server was spot on all night...thanks Jeff for a great night...on your last night there..   They had a few draft beers of which the Founders IPA was good. They also have Bells Two Hearted Ale in the bottle.  Make a reservation a week in advance if you plan to go on a Fri or Sat night.",

    "text": "I've seen a lot of fusion restaurants during my time as a sushi chef, but I must admit that this is possibly the first time I've seen a True East-meets-West kind of fusion by swapping burger ingredients with sushi ingredients while maintaining the integrity of their form and function.  When I sat down and looked at the menu, the most unique and bizarre items on the menu was the Burgushi where sushi ingredients came together as a burger and Western cuisine came together as a roll (Unlike Philly rolls, which are just abominations).  An odd concept nonetheless.  I came with a friend and we ordered the Spicy Togarashi Shrimp as an appetizer.  My friend ordered two of the \"Burgushi\" rolls and I ordered the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich.  The Spicy Togarashi Shrimp were deep fried shrimp covered in sweet and spicy sauce.  It was delicious and the portion was generous, but as far as taste goes, I could have probably ordered something similar from a P.F. Chang (in a non-offensive manner of speaking).  The \"Burgushi\" however is a completely different story.  Not only was my sandwich delicious, they were extremely creative using soy paper, rice, and fake crab meat to make the \"buns\" of my sandwich.  It was surprisingly large and filling yet didn't feel extremely heavy after finishing.  The rolls however can get a bit filling especially those that are topped with mayo (But then again, the \"premium\" rolls at other sushi restaurants do the same thing so you judge).  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience with friendly wait staff and good food with a very small wait time. It's a little more expensive than your typical fusion restaurant, but it's worth the premium you pay.  Food: 4 Service: 5 Price: 3.5",

They don't take reservations and the wait can be lengthy sometimes, but it's well worth the wait.",

    "text": "It was my first time here and will probably be the last. My bf decided to take me here for July 4th dinner before we hit the fireworks. Our waitress, Ashley, took our order and never came back. We got our food from another girl and she took care of us. Our burgers were plain and it was like they were stingy with the bbq sauce when it was supposed to have bbq sauce on it. Can't even taste it. Our drinks was emptied for a long time, and no one seemed to care. There was a man in a green shirt, maybe he's the manager or whatever he was, but he was walking around talking on his phone. That's just rude. If you're gonna talk on the phone, go somewhere else, don't come walking around everyone talking. He walked by us a couple of times and act as if he didn't see our empty cups. The first waitress came back and had the nerve to ask \"Can I wrap this up for you?\"   Really? Does it look like I'm done?!!   She don't even come check on us or refill our drinks and, when she does come check on us, she asked us to leave? How RUDE?!  So at the end of our meal, we get a survey to take, and I wrote my honest opinion on it and I'm sure she threw that paper away because I did NOT right good about her.  So, thanks a lot, Cowfish, for making this year the worst July 4th dinner.",

    "text": "It had been a while since I'd ventured into The Cowfish. Their long waits make it somewhat of a standoff for hungry Southpark goers. Made it in on a Sunday afternoon and my wife and I were astonished at how fast we were seated. They make it happen here.   Side note: cell reception (att iPhone) is almost non existent. Good luck, iPhoners.  First off, we were starving. We had just gotten back from a camping trip and were ready to gorge on our silverware if we had to. Started off with a couple of beers. OMB and Blue Moon. Always amazing. Let me say that presentation of water is never anything to bat an eyelash at, but Cowfish makes you think twice. Served in a glass milk bottle. Uhh...hello, badass!   For apps, we ordered the sticks, sweets and strings. If you have a small army of fried food-loving people to feed, this is the appetizer for you. Piled high with sweet potato fries, onion straws and amazing seasoned fries.   Entrees:  My wife got the green monster, veggie style. So good and topped with an array of chiles and fried jalapenos. Cucumbers were a nice touch and relief from the inherent heat.   I ventured into burgushi land for the first time. Went for the taste explosion as it was our server's recommendation. I'm at a loss for words. The texture: odd but welcomed. The composition: pretty large. Nicely done and plated beautifully. The flavor: this is where I struggle. So many flavors. The nori, sticky rice, beef, jalapenos and bacon were so savory but separate. Right amount of heat. Just hard to land on whether or not its groundbreaking. Let's say my interest has been peaked and I'm ready for the next roll on the menu. Bring it on, burgushi!  The Cowfish is worth anyone's time. Charlotte native, visitor, what have you, you need to stop in and sample their vast menu. Service is professional, fast and friendly. Warning: be prepared to wait on busy nights! That patio is hot to trot in the Southpark scene. Get in there fast!  Cheers!",

I guess she's saving her words for some other occasion, but at least learn to speak to customers in full sentences!

    "text": "So I've read all the hype about Cowfish and for some, unknown reason, I never made an effort to go there. Maybe because I heard horror stories about the ridiculously long lines, maybe because so many places with similar reputations just don't live up to hype.....I don't know. But my best friends were in town and I decided to pick an \"off time\" to dine (we went at 3pm on a Sunday), if there is ever such a time at this establishment. And thankfully, the wait was less than 10 minutes and we grabbed a seat outside on this lovely day.  First thing we noticed was the HUGE and exhaustive menu. My Gawd....there's more choices on the menu than people named Chin in a Chinese telephone book! Not necessarily a bad thing, mind you. But sometimes you got to wonder if having TOO many choices can lead to execution errors? Maybe I've been watching too many Food Network/Kitchen Nightmare programs......  Back to the review. We started with their coconut battered onion rings with 2 types of dipping sauces: 1 was your traditional ranch style sauce (with Sriracha or horseradish I believe) and another was a Thai sweet chili sauce. Both were excellent, and the onion was surprisingly VERY good. Not soggy at all, crisp with excellent flavor. Great start.  On to the sushi rolls. Got the Mark's Roll which is not on their online menu. It had tuna and cream cheese in it. Tempura battered and flash fried. Need I say more? Was delicious. Not uber flavorful but the texture contrast was excellent. Also tried their Blackened Tuna roll, with lump crab meat, and sliced jalapenos. Almost tasted like a mini crab cake, with heat. Was good. Not the best sushi I've ever had but a solid roll.   My buddy Dean got the Ultimate Bento Box, which had a very delicious sushi roll, an excellent blend of Thai Sweet/Heat cucumber salad, a double stacked mini burger, edamame and some sweet potato fries. Very good. His wife Lisa got the Greek Salad, which was HUGE! Tip for Ladies......this is one LARGE salad! It would have feed all of us big guys at the table.....just sayin.....And it WAS yummy with fried battered pepperoncinis! Never had them like that before. My buddy and I both got their burgers, as this after all IS supposedly a burger joint! I got the Black Truffle Cheeseburger (they had me at truffle) and my buddy Steve got Boursin Bacon Burger (they had him with Boursin/Bacon). Both met my burger criteria of SLOPPY (meaning uber juicy), flavorful, and cooked no more than MEDIUM (for flavor). The mushrooms were fresh and black truffle cheese excellent! Oh and they serve them on BRIOCHE! I mean, who doesn't love a buttery brioche! The French are probably cringing that we Americans put a BURGER on them! But WTF, who CARES! It was AWESOME to have those flavors stuck between buttery pieces of soft bread! Good call Cowfish!  Finally, like THAT wasn't enough food, my buddy Steve gets a Carmel Chocolate Espresso Milkshake! He really need those extra 1000 or so calories to wash down the 3000 we just consumed! But boy was it delicious!  Tip #2: If you're on ANY kind of diet whatsoever, Cowfish is NOT YOUR PLACE! \"Danger Will Robinson - the Calories are attacking!\" But if you want excellent and flavorful food, then Cowfish IS the place for you! I had to \"suspend\" my diet for this day.....now I've got to bicycle around the world twice and ingest 5 doses of Lipator to get back on track....Can't wait to go back to try their PRIME TIME FILET & LOBSTER ROLL. That sounds yummy!",

    "text": "(3.5/4)   Snazzy menu with unique dishes. Check. Solid ingredients. Most definitely. Adorable cow-fish mutant logo. Where can I buy t-shirts with this?  Service that automatically offered to split a check for a table of 9. Double Check  Food. Half Check. I sort of came with high expectations but I will try to keep it objective. Serving sizes were huge. Our table was full before the entrees even arrived. I blame the menu. It makes you want to try everything.   For appetizers we got calamari, ahi tuna nachos, fried pickles, and truffle fries. Truffle fries were the best--skinny cut and topped with creamy sauce. The topping of the nachos were great as well but I didn't care of the wonton. It didn't quite add to the flavors and fell apart before I could even eat it. Fried pickles, I guess, are a southern staple and unfortunately just not for me. Finally, the calamari was a major disappointment with the 2-1 batter-to-squid ratio.   My entree was the 'taste explosion' roll which was disappointing. The flavors were interesting but there was too much rice in my roll and as a result turned into a carb-filled car crash when deep fried. For a generalist food fan, it might have been enjoyable, but it was much too heavy for a sushi roll.  I shared a spiked shake -- Sleepless in Brooklyn -- with a neighbor which was basically like your typical vanilla shake with some spiced rum and kahlua. Server recommended it and I'd probably try something more flavorful next time.   I'm not sold on \"burgushi\" itself yet but I can't deny that this is a good restaurant. It has a lot of charm as well given the odd couple of burger and sushi as well as the strange voices and music playing the bathroom. Don't forget to sign up for the mailing list for a free appetizer coupon! A friend of mine got the Doug's filet roll which had rare filet mignon on top--I probably would have liked that better. P.s. Thanks Jonathan B. for the recommendation!",

    "text": "I was looking forward to my first trip to Cowfish and it did not disappoint. It is very popular so expect it to be loud and there will most likely be a wait. We were seated on the heated patio which was quieter than the dinning room so we were happy to sit there. The server was really nice. We started with the tuna nachos. They were delicious. Instead of chips they served them on top of fried wontons. The cab Rangoon base was tasty. The tuna was fresh and served rare. I tried their regular bento box since it was my first time eating here. The burger was a nice medium rare and really tasty. I had the Philly roll was delicious. The salmon was fresh and the rice was well seasoned. They are very generous with the sides in the bento box. I changed my fries to seaweed salad. It was only a 50 cent upgrade for a huge portion of salad. The seaweed salad was not overwhelmed by sesame oil. The Thai cucumber salad was sweet, spicy, and very delicious. The edamame were good and plentiful. For dessert we tried the chocolate mouse brownie. I was most disappointed with that. It was by no means bad but it was not like it was described. It tasted like chocolate cake with mouse and whipped cream on it. I would order a different dessert next time. overall it was 5 star food and service and I would come back again.",

My favorite from the sake sampler was the Fuji Apple, it's a must try.  Next time I would consider getting a larger size.  I was not a fan of the Lobster and crab roll and would not order that as an appetizer again.  However, I highly recommend the crab dip appetizer, it's a good choice.  I've never had an issue with the customer service and the atmosphere is pretty nice (nothing special, just nice).  Oh and if it's your birthday, they sing a special song for you! ha!",

The Korean chicken sandwich was a huge disappointment. There wasn't enough heat, I didn't get any. I added sriracha to it. The condiments were almost nil as well as the kimchi. The spider roll was pretty good, a little fishy but nothing the wasabi couldn't cover up. But the last roll was aesthetically appealing, but not edible with the shrimp with the shell and tail on! The server was nice, accommodating. The music was terrible, absolutely.",

    "text": "We waited about an hour on a Saturday night for first available table (arrived at 6:30pm).  They don't take reservations.  There was plenty of room at the bar and your notified by text when your table is ready which is great because you can walk around and shop nearby if you want.  There is a big screen that shows all the characters of people waiting in a fish tank and then your character gets scooped out when it's your turn.  Gotta say, it was pretty cute and we were all high-fiving when we finally made it out of the tank and to a table.    First available for us mean sitting outside in uncomfortable chairs on a plastic wrapped patio under a heat lamp so... yeah... so much for ambiance.  But after waiting for an hour, we were just ready to eat.    We started with the shishito peppers with bonito flakes and the blackened tuna nachos.  The nachos came out really quickly but the peppers ended up coming out pretty much with our entrees.  The peppers and nachos were both tasty apps.  For dinner, our table went with a range of both sushi and burgers.  Everything was delicious.    I don't know that I'd necessarily come back here but it's mainly because it's just bombastically loud and chaotic and had a big wait.  But overall, it's a fun restaurant and a great option in South Park.  My husband loves burgers and I love sushi so it was a win win!",

I've been there a few times, and mainly stayed in the appetizer and sandwich sections of the menu. The calamari, lobster/crab spring rolls, and onion rings, were all great... The jalapeno burger, and the Boursin burger (1/2 lb) were big, juicy and dripping with flavor, but if you're a lamb fan, (I am) you owe it to yourself to get the Mediterranean lamb burger. It's head smacking good. As far as all those good reviews on this place? They're on the mark...",

    "text": "Yum. Yum. Yum. Holy Yum.   One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I often save this place for when I would really like to splurge because I often want several things off the menu. The menu is HUGE!  We often find ourselves here for date night, birthdays, or when I have out of town guests because there is something for everyone.  My favorite thing to start with is the Crab Rangoon dip. So good!  Next is your hardest decision yet- burger or sushi? Both are amazing here, which is difficult to pull off and Cowfish has done just that.  If you can't decide go with a bento box. It has edamame, cucumbers, a burger slider, and a sushi roll. Just enough food for one person and not too much food to where they have to roll you outside. They also have burgushi (a fusion of a burger and sushi). I've never had this, but I have had a family member have some and they were very satisfied.  You will be satisfied with any burger, really. And any sushi roll. Have at it.   The place has great cocktails, craft beer, and even spiked milkshakes, so you will not be disappointed with drinks. I have had one of the spiked shakes and they are delish.   Lastly, get the s'mores milkshake. Just do it. It is incredible. I never spend the money on dessert, but it's so worth it and I get it every time I am here. Just a tip: they are one of the few places to still do free dessert on someone's birthday, so this is why we often find ourselves here on birthdays b/c they will sing and bring the birthday person cake.   There is almost always a wait, so plan ahead for this, but it is worth it. The earlier you go the better usually.  It isn't terribly expensive, but I often spend $50- $75 after you get drinks, appetizer, food, and dessert. This is why this is often a splurge for me, but so worth it.   This is the only place in the world that can get shut down for Norovirus and people are ready to bang down the doors the second the professional cleaning is over and they are back in business b/c the food is seriously amazing lol. Way to go.",

There was a reviewer who rated her experience 2 stars and as part of the review claim the restaurant isn't for children under 10 due to it not being the \"appeaseable scene\". I'm not sure what this means. It really depends on the behavior of the child, as no two children will behave the same.Restaurant itself is dark. Almost too dark to read the menu. The noise level is pretty loud so children fit right in. There is a bar that goes along the length of the restaurant but I'm not sure If this means it's not adequate for children. There is a really neat kids menu including a bento box that my children loved. My daughter actually was not a sushi eater prior to our visit. She refused to try it. She had an appetizer with us and loved it. They both had shakes which were awesome. This to me indicates the restaurant is geared towards family style dining.Restaurant is pricey in my opinion and isn't something we will do all the time but it was a nice change and the food and service was great. Wait for a table was long, come early as our wait was close to an hour. We will definitely visit again.",

A co diner sent something prepared incorrectly back, and they used the same piece of grilled tuna to remake the plate and brought it back cold.

The waitress didn't come by very often and check on us, and we waited quite a while to get the bill and our change back. Oh well.. very clean and the food was excellent.

I ordered The Green Monster Berger- Best. Berger. EVER! Coworker doubted me until I let him try it. I had so much of everyones appatizers, I could not finish the burger. When the server came to take the plate, my coworker about jumped on the plate for my remaining bite.   Several had sushi and one person even made her own sushi roll...nobody was even remotely disappointed.   Once we were stuffed to the gills, the server suggested a desert- of course we had to try the Spiked Milk Shakes...4 of them so we passed each one around the table (seperate straws for each person)  this will be a destination for every visit I make to the area...no question",

    "text": "This is a restaurant that flaunts its stuff in the face of convention. Its menu is a mile long and paved with flavorful pabulum. It's like an enormous treasure map covered with X's. And the real secret behind the goodness? The wait. Something about standing around for an hour waiting to be seated makes the food taste twice as good. So don't be bitter about the line; it's there for good reason.  Cowfish is the perfect \"couples\" restaurant. It's not particularly romantic - the constant stream of people coming and going prevents an intimate ambiance - but burgers for him and sushi for her? Sheer brilliance. At $25-$40 for two (closer to $40 with drinks), it wouldn't threaten to cut too big a hole in your wallet if it wasn't so addicting.  Like I said, the menu is big, but you find your niche by the second or third trip. My niche is the burger menu, and my go-to is the most counter-intuitive meal on a menu filled with bizarre creations: the \"Hunka, Hunka Burnin' Love.\" This Elvis-inspired burger features two half-pound beef patties (though I tend to request just one), two slices of applewood-smoked bacon, fried banana, and a big gob of peanut butter nestled in a sweet Hawaiian roll. My friends tend to cringe when I tell them about it, but trust me, one bite and you'll be saying, \"Thank you very much.\" Here's a tip: substitute one of Cowfish's home-ground, Chipotle-seasoned bison patties for the beef. It'll cost you $4 more, but the Chipotle adds a nice, spicy kick to offset the semi-sweet peanut butter/banana combo. Burgers come with a generous side item, and Cowfish has some of the most savory sweet potato fries around. It'll take several trips to fully explore the burger menu, but after doing some extensive exploration myself, I'm sticking with the Hunka.  Since there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of sushi rolls to choose from, I'll go ahead and and mention my fiancee's favorite. **Disclaimer: she is a bit of a health nut.** She goes straight for the \"Build-Your-Own Sushi\" option, selecting seaweed and brown rice wrapped around generous portions of Ahi tuna, mango, and avocado. I don't care much for sushi, but I dig that roll. From time to time she'll order a Bento Box, which features a mini-burger of the week, and if we're really hungry, we might order the \"Avocado & Ahi Tuna-Tini\" or the \"Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos\" for a starter. **Second disclaimer: we like tuna.** Their spiked shakes are indulgent, but be wise about dessert. Chances are, you'll already be full.  Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the bathrooms. As soon as you walk in, you'll hear a series of voices overhead. First, you will hear someone say something in proper English. Then, you will hear the phrase repeated in Indonesian. Finally, you will hear the phrase re-told in redneck dialect. You'll walk in and wonder what on earth is going on, then you'll walk out saying things like, \"Jim Bob's more nervous than a cat in a room with a room full of rocking chairs!\"  There may be restaurants in Charlotte with more privacy and less wait time, but there are no other restaurants quite like Cowfish. I give it five stars and a hug and a kiss.",

I've been wanting to go to this place to see what all the hype was about but really who doesn't get excited about burgers & sushi IN THE SAME PLACE!! I finally convinced my wife to go here instead of her all time favorite, Pinky's (also a good spot!) but we've been there only a hundred times lol. We started out with a Skinny Gonzales to drink which was tasty and surprisingly stronger than expected. Then we had the lobster & crab spring rolls for an app, definitely a must try! I don't remember tasting much lobster but I did demolish it. I was hungry and the flavor was impeccable! We decided to get Bento boxes so we could try out a little bit of everything and switched up on the sides a bit as well as the burger because I don't eat beef. So with that being said I had a mini chicken sandwich (screamin korean chicken), truffle fries (no bacon), Dion's OMG! Roll, and thai cucumbers a sh*t ton of food and I have no complaints! Everything was great!! Servers were also very helpful being that I'm the most indecisive person alive. I gave then 4 stars because we ended up paying $88 for two drinks, one app, and two bento boxes... that was a little steep for the type of restaurant this is if you ask me. I would definitely give them a try if you've never been though! Although your pockets may suffer, you won't be disappointed with the taste!",

    "text": "There are only a handful of moments in my life that I can look back and say without question \"I experienced greatness\". A trip to cowfish is almost always one of those moments.  I can say without a doubt that this is my favorite restaurant of all time.   The service is always top notch. They know their stuff and my drink is always full. I'm never left asking \"Where did they go?\" If something goes wrong (and it rarely does),  they make it right. The management makes their presence known and they seem to support their staff well. I can tell real training and effort goes into the hospitality of this wonderful place.  There are so many things to pick from on their menu but here are my personal favorites:  For appetizers on the regular menu, it's a three way tie for the crab rangoon, the parmesan truffle fries, and blackened tuna nachos. The parmesan truffle fries work really well if you have a large party. The fries come out in what looks like a mixing bowl, they're tastefully covered in a delicious white cheese and have just enough luxurious truffle flavor. Their crab rangoon is like a deconstructed version. What would normally be the filling is served as dip and the wontons are fried and treated like chips. There's a hint of heat and sweetness dressing the chips and when you combine that with the crab, it is heaven. The blackened tuna nachos is what you order if you want to impress someone. The appearance alone is an artistic statement. Underneath a little bit of greenery, the tuna is seared beautifully. The large bites of fish rest in top of creamy avocado and crab rangoon.  A special mention goes to the Head Chef Rafali's special hamachi tasting plate for being the most gorgeous thing that I've eaten. It was a beautiful mix of sweet, tangy, and umami. A True masterpiece visually and on my pallet as well.   One of my favorite entrees is not on the Charlotte Cowfish's regular menu anymore. That is The King's Roll. I would say I'm sad but I can still order it. It is tuna, kani, jalapeno, and cream cheese roll flash fried in panko then topped with a loose Kani, masago, and sriracha salad. Dip it in ponzu and soar. My favorite still listed item is The Prime Time fillet lobster roll. So if you can't decide whether you want a lobster roll or filet mignon, you can skip comprising and get both with this bad boy. It comes with the best portobello mushrooms on top. Looking for a non sushi option? Try the chipotle bison burger, just don't be one of those monsters who orders it well done. Medium well is as high as you should go with this one.  Dessert. Eat the moose is loose. If you can't eat it, get one to go. If you can't get it to go, give it to me. The tall chocolate cake/brownie with layers of mousse is delightful and fun. It's a good way to finish an already spectacular evening.  Cowfish is the best and most consistently spectacular restaurant that I've eaten at. I think back to all of my visits over the years and I can't think of a single time where I left feeling disappointed.   Cowfish is a treasure and I look forward to continuing to share this place with my friends and family for years to come.",

One of the few places that has this combination and both are really good.   I recommend getting the bento box so you can get both and you get three sides. It is a lot of food and you get to try a little of everything.   Their atmosphere is very nice and has a ton of great art work on the walls. The restaurant has an indoor and outdoor area.   The parking here can be a bit hard to fine. Worst case scenario you park near Dillard's and walk over though.",

    "text": "Been trying to talk my wife into coming here for years and now she loves it.  Had to drive into Charlotte today to go to Walkers Drug Store and pick up eye drops for my upcoming cataract surgery. While we were here, decided on lunch and she let me pick the place so I picked Cowfish.  After we got there, she enjoyed the rather eclectic decor.  Very light on bright with a whimsical atmosphere.  I mean where else would you see an Apple logo made over into a burger.  Menu is rather extensive and varied.  Long list of custom burgers, equally long list of Sushi and a trove of Asian Fusion  Specialties.  My wife loves Spring Rolls so she chose the Lobster and Crab Spring Roll off of the Appetizer menu and paired it with Sweet Potato Fries as well as a Martini since I was driving.  I was going to go with a Mushroom Burger till she suggested one of the Bento Boxes.  Here was a chance to try multiple items across several different cuisines.  It ordered The Cowfish Bento Box which started with a mini Cheeseburger, 4 Pieces of Sushi ( I chose the Philly which is Salmon), Sweet and Spicy Thai Cucumbers, Edamame and Sweet Potato Fries.  My wife enjoyed the Lobster and Crab Spring Rolls although there were a little rich for her taste. I was surprised that she ordered that since she is not a big lobster fan.  She did however dive into the Sweet Potato Fries which is one of her favorites.  For my Bento Box, the Mini- Cheeseburger was very good and was a great way to start off the meal. Each piece of the Philly Sushi topped with a dab of Wasabe  was excellent.  The Sweet and Spicy Thai Cucumbers were interesting. Was not sure of first bit rather or not I was going to like them but by the time I finished, I loved the texture and contrasts in colors. The Edamame did not do much for me since most that I have eaten were very tender and these were hard.  Sweet Potato Fries and my wife's favorite and not mine but still they were good and by this point, I was getting full.    Portion sizes are huge.  Servers are very good and very attentive. We never lacked for anything from the time we walked in and were seated till we left.  Will be back",

They also have \"burgushi\" - a burger/sushi roll - we didn't try it but definitely plan to if we get the chance to eat here again.   We went early in the lunch hour on a Friday afternoon and there was plenty of seating available. The service was good, which added to the positive experience. Our appetizer order got messed up and didn't come out before our meal, but the manager came to our table to explain and handled the situation very well.  Overall we were very pleased with the experience and would highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "So now that I'm doing a keto diet (lost three pounds the first week over Thanksgiving!), we ended up back at Cowfish and here's me looking for low-carb options. Well, Cowfish accommodates and in spades!  I chose the Cobb salad with blue cheese. It was massive. You know how so many salads are more lettuce than \"stuff\"? That was not the case here. I was eating chicken and cheese and blue cheese and olives and bacon and cucumber and avocado all throughout this salad. And with this much food, I ended up only able to eat half of it. Just an impressive meal here.  My daughter, also doing keto, went with the Hamandegger Burger, hold the bun. A huge patty with plenty of cheese and two large pieces of crunchy bacon. Lettuce and onions and again, huge. She also subbed out the fries and got a seaweed salad instead. Delish!  Great keto-friendly options here at Cowfish and I'm so pleased that we headed back here.

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try this place, having heard about it in the radio and word-of-mouth. Also seeing that it was a 4-star yelp review, but unbiased - I came to make my own opinion.  Location: tough parking curb-side, but there is a deck and a short walk to it.  Ambiance: Pretty trendy, they got fun pop-art posters with a twist, full wrap around bar and tables. A little noisy in the front, but the back tables are casual  Food: It's a place to get your american grub - burgers, and your japanese staple - sushi at once. For that I always get the Burgoushi. Which is a Bento box that comes with half of a selection of specialty rolls and a slider version of their burger. The menu states it's only the burger of the week, but you can pretty much chose any burger, if you ask nicely. It also says they serve it with sweet potato fries, but I always ask for regular. The seasoning is quite tasty. Thai cucumbers and edamame are also included  As for the half-roll I always chose between the Mark and the Firecracker.  For the burger my top pics are the Texas Longhorn, the Shroomin Swiss or the Black truffle cheeseburger.   Appetizer: I never get around ordering the Crab Rangoon dip. chips are crispy, dip is creamy. Party next to us had spring rolls, they were huge and looked and smelled good too. Maybe next time!  Drinks: Bamboozeled shakes. No sleep till brooklyn is the best. One word: KALUAH!  Even though these recommendations are my favorite, I do not want to say that they are they best out there. If you want a good burger, i've had better fusion or non-fusion at burger places. If you want sushi, there are other sushi places in town.  But they definitely have their leg up if you want both, or some of your people in your party don't want sushi, but want to hang out while you still get your sushi fix.",

We ordered the \"Mother Load\" because we didnt want a huge meal, but wanted a \"sampling if some of our favorite selections\" including the \"chefs selection of premium sashimi.\" The sashimi was the most disappointing. The \"premium selection\" happened to include shrimp and octopus. I'm sorry, but that is neither sashimi or premium. Poke was good, and the Boss Roll was decent, but honestly if no one told us we were eating filet mignon, we would have no clue.   I did enjoy my saki flight though!

I really like the concept as if you want Asian/sushi you can get that but if you want a good quality burger, you can have that also.    I have tried many of the dishes that they offer.   The sushi is really fresh and the portions are insane.  The burgers are good and the lamb burger is my favorite.  But they have one item that I love and it is the Gobble Gobble Ooshi.  Basically think thanksgiving dinner in a sushi roll.   It is heavenly.  The only drawback is that it is only available during the month of November (through thanksgiving).    Service is good as they always are attentive and make sure that you don't want for anything.    This is a great place",

Although we had to wait an hour, there was enough in the area to keep us occupied and the hostesses were willing to text us rather than carry around one of those buzzers. Once we were seated the server was quick and friendly. The menu is huge, but we quickly decided on a few items. My boyfriend got the seared tuna BLT and I had a mix box with a sushi roll and a burger. We also ordered the fried pickle appetizer -- so good! We'll definitely be back next time we're in town.",

This seemed a little odd for a Sunday evening.  After we placed our name on the list, we made our way to the fountain to pass the time.  The first thing we noticed was the patio had many open tables.  It looked like they were short staffed that night.  We ended up waiting for 45 minutes for our table and were seated on the patio at a table that was open for our entire wait!  Our server was helpful and courteous and summarized the long menu for us.  Overall the food was fine.  Cowfish will not be at the top of my list when dining in the SouthPark area.",

For a raw roll the Tropical Storm is yummy. It has three layers of assorted fish with masago on top. Also, our food came out fast which is always a plus!",

    "text": "I will never go back to Cowfish based on my experience, and I wasn't even able to try the food. My friend and I were looking for a great patio restaurant to enjoy the warm spring weather. I arrived first and was greeted at the hostess stand with an instant \"we're on a forty-five min to an hour wait\". Well, ok, I guess I'll just have a seat at the bar and wait. My friend had not arrived yet, so I people watched a bit and noticed that not only were there few guests waiting for tables and an empty bar, but there was also a fairly empty restaurant. The bartender explained that the waitlist was so the kitchen didn't get overwhelmed. So you're going to make me sit in your lobby- not spending money and possibly losing guests, because you don't want me to sit at a table- spending money and possibly very happily waiting with a drink and a spring breeze so the kitchen can keep up? I have worked in the service and hospitality industry for 15 years, I understand how wait times and staffing works, but an hour wait when I can count 20 people in the lobby/bar area and over 10 open tables? My friend arrived about 20 minutes into my wait-time and asked if I had remembered to request the patio. I had not, so he went to the hostess stand to amend our reservation and inquire about the long wait in an empty restaurant. He asked if the wait list applied to the patio and was told that they don't take reservations for the patio. Ok..So we just seat ourselves? Please remove us from the waitlist then, we'll go sit on the patio. We were handed menus in response so we walked back and found a nice table in the shade. We also found a patio of about fifteen tables with only the back section nearest the restaurant seated, the rest empty. Again, we questioned the hour long wait time with so many empty tables. Our server was very sweet and greeted us instantly, taking our drink order. We were then greeted by a gentleman manager who explained that we would have to be moved because he needed our table for a large group. We looked at all the empty tables and asked where he would like us to move. He explained that we would actually be put back on the waitlist, because the patio was full. Ok.. Why is it full with so many empty tables available and an eager and obviously bored server who had greeted us instantly a moment ago? He explained that it was a staffing issue, new restaurant, still working out the kinks of staffing.. blah blah blah.. dinner is on me tonight for the inconvenience. Our server arrived with drinks in hand, confused about why the manager was speaking with us. She then offered to pick up a table, because she had another table about to close out and would be able to take care of us at one of the unstaffed tables nearby. We had no interest in a free dinner, we just wanted to sit somewhere and have dinner. We looked to the manager who brushed off the suggestion, then demanded who had seated us at that table in the first place, the hostesses knew that he had need to seat a large party there. We explained the conversation that we had had with the hostess at the front, and the manager exclaimed that his hostesses never would have said that we could seat ourselves and which one was it, because she's just lost her job. Seriously? Again, you're putting your staffing issues on the guest? Well, she did say it, and I don't think it's necessary for her to lose her job over it. We'll just go across the street to Upstream if you need us to wait any longer. The server again suggested that we would be fine at the table next door, but the manager at this point seemed so focused on being right and disciplining his staff that he ignored her suggestion and we started walking to the exit. By the time we had gathered our things and reached the door, the manager and hostess in question approached, with the hostess in full denial (not to blame her, as the manager had already threatened her job). The manager then called us liars who had seated ourselves. Yes, we already told you we seated ourselves, but how do you think we got our menus? At this point, we were done arguing with this manager because it just seemed to us that he wanted to be right more than he wanted to make the situation amenable and display a little hospitality. Never again will I walk through those doors. I will not give my time and money to a place with exorbitant wait-times and ill-managed staff.",

    "text": "ah, i remember the good ole days when i was able to walk in to the cowfish sans reservation and get seated in a reasonable amount of time.  if last thursday night is any indication, it looks like that kind of a lark won't be happening again soon.  when a joint demands weekday reservations, you know it's hit it big.  around the time the restaurant first opened in the space formally occupied by \"the counter\" and \"the grape\", i was somewhat concerned that a restaurant with this kind of concept would not catch on in an economy with high demands and sullen creativity.  in this instance, i'm more than happy to be wrong.  the combination of sushi and burgers isn't the first thing one thinks of when trying to make suggestions for dinner, but i've got to admit, it sure is memorable.  alas, i've also got to admit that the burgers are much better than the sushi.  after trying several different rolls and an assortment of burgers, i feel pretty confident in saying that nikko on south boulevard still retains the queen city sushi crown.  the fish on the caterpillar roll at the cowfish was not as fresh as it could have been, the nigiri was just okay, and my moriawase double deuce (sushi combination platter) did not compete well with my husband's boursin burger.  it's not that the sushi sucked - it's just that the burgers stood out more.  the only exception to that rule appears to be the make-your-own-sushi roll.  my veganish friends fell in love with their own vegetable concoction that was surprisingly awesome, if i do say so myself.  the sweet potato fries rocked, and i fell completely for the blackened ahi tuna nachos . . . even as i write those words, my mind drifts into a momentary recollection of their avocado-laced deliciousness.  i'm convinced that the individual who first paired tuna with avocado must now be a chef in the kitchen upstairs.  in terms of burgers, i've really enjoyed the aforementioned boursin burger, loved the cbclt, and thought the mediterranean lamb burger was fabulous.  the vibe is solidly modern at the cowfish, if a bit quirky.  i think the owners thought they needed to embrace as much odd as possible in a joint with such a unique concept.  visit the w.c. and hear the strangest malarkey in an array of languages . . . making you tilt your head and think \"wtf?\".  honestly, i thought it was just as charming as the cute rendition of \"guernica\" arranged on a bloodred wall (complete with the requisite \"cowfish\").  save for one occasion at the beginning where it took an absolutely ridiculous amount of time to receive our food, the service has been very solid.  on that occasion in question, i will say that one of the owners came to our table to personally apologize for the delay.  i always wonder why it is that other owners/managers don't showcase the same level of concern - it absolutely makes a world of difference.  hell, we went back (with ten other people) . . .  . . . and we will definitely go again.",

My other two friends ordered a variety of things off the copius menu...it too 3 tries before our server got their order right,  In the meantime, 2 of us were done eating.  There was no attempt to offer a free dessert, comp the appetizer, or even offer a free beverage for the trouble. We will not be going back.

The wait was to be about 30 minutes and we were notified the table was ready about 20 minutes later. After we were seated, the waitress visited the table promptly and took our drink orders. The noise level in the area we were seated was very, very loud, significantly distracting from our enjoyment. The waitress came back a few minutes later and took our food orders. This is when things really broke down. A full 35 minutes later, after not seeing her for quite a while, we flagged down the waitress to ask about our order. After saying it would be a few minutes, she turned and quickly left. Almost 10 minutes later, our food arrived. Cold. With a comment that there were too many people in the restaurant! The food was OK and could well have been very good if it was served properly heated.  There was little concern for either the wait or the cold food. When the place is jammed with a long wait, it appears they really don't have to care and clearly didn't. Could be just the place for you, not for us. Just a warning....",

We went on a Wednesday (after refusing to wait 2 hours on a Saturday), and it was 1/2 price bottle of wine night. Oh my. Good wines, at half price, Im in. For dinner, I had the Boursin Burger, which was so good I literally could not eat it fast enough. Best burger ever. Really. My husband had sushi, and he is a sushi novice, so he cant compare it to much, but he really liked it. We skipped dessert (I drank my dessert, did I mention bottles were half price) but desserts going to other tables looked good. If your curious about this place, try it, you wont be disappointed. The food is worth whatever wait you encounter. Yea...the hostess was kinda bitchy and the crowd was your standard Southpark crew, but I rate places based on food. If you want the best damn food in CLT, head to Cowfish.",

The food is delicious and exquisite, plus having a huge selection to customized your sushi roll, for someone like myself or anyone that's trying sushi for the first time this place is the perfect place to go to. Cassandra was our waitress for the evening and her recommendations were literally on point, but also someone that truly went above and beyond to providing me a superb 1st time experience and guidance as well. From bringing me multiple choices of dipping sauces to even giving me some great and well executed tips to create my roll (pulled pork, ground beef, tomato, filet mignon and applewood bacon) she literally understood not only what I wanted but literally how I wanted my roll to taste. And, she recommended the blackened tuna nachos which are a must have! The texture is on point and it is simply juicy and extremely delicious, you will be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this savory treat. Also, I enjoy the fact the manager (Chris) came to our table and spoke to me and my girlfriend abour our first time visiting the restaurant and about my first time experience eating sushi (my girlfriend has been to other sushi places and she couldn't stop raving about this place). Not only was I impressed but it shows a great commitment to delivering a superb experience to their customers and the quality of service they are trying to deliver and I hope it continues. Overall, hands down HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE not just to those that are sushi lovers but also to those trying it for the first time as well. This place with everything that it has to offer won't let you down.",

    "text": "Came to Cowfish for their infamous Rangoon Crab dip since a friend had been raving about it and it did not disappoint.  From the outside, Cowfish looks rather small, but there's also a huge patio on the side.  The vibe is an interesting fusion of American and Japanese tastes.   I got a kick out of hearing Japanese translations of American slang in the bathroom over the intercom.    For my entree, I had the \"What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich.\"  It had a really interesting \"bun\" made out of grilled spring roll wrappers filled with sushi rice and flatten into a square.  The \"fusion\" items may be a little too over-the-top and simple may be best.  Cowfish also offers make-your-own sushi rolls so you can completely customize everything.  My friend made a tuna roll with thai basil which turned out to be a really good and surprising combination.",

We sat at the bar and service was attentive but somehow slow, they were busy so we understood. After long review of the menu I decided on the surf & turf roll. Sounds delicious right?! False. It was dry and flavorless. I had to drench it in sriracha to numb my tastebuds because I was so hungry & refused to not eat a sushi roll so expensive. The worst part is the manager told us \"it's not even that busy for a Saturday lunch\" so you normally anticipate more people and now that you have less I still get shitty food & mediocre service. I gave 3 stars because my boyfriends food was alright and the ambience was appealing. But I still don't think I will be back.",

And this place did not disappoint!  We went on a Saturday afternoon, they had a small wait but offered immediate seating on the heated patio. We opted to sit out on the patio, and it was really nice! Very comfortable and warm, which was a pleasant surprise!  Our waitress greeted us immedietly, and gave us our menus. Those menus are ridicilous! I had no idea where to start....but when in doubt...start with a cold glass of beer! I selected the Purple Haze-which was light bodied with a hint of raspberry. It was very refreshing and delicious!   Now back to that awesome menu...I decided to try one of the amazing burgers. I chose the The Jalapeno Popper Show-Stopper- cool name right?? Well it's an even better burger!   This burger came loaded with jalapeno-infused cream cheese, jalapeno bacon and fried jalapenos. Served on a brioche bun with jalapeno citrus aioli, lettuce, tomato and fresh sliced jalapenos.   WOWsers!!! I chose to sub the beef patty with a veggie burger and that was an awesome desision! It was packed with several different beans, cranberries and delicious veggies! That jalepeno cream cheese was heavenly...and fried and fresh jalepenos together was a wonderful combination for the burger. It has a nice kick with each bite!  If you love a little bit of spicy this burger is for you!   There are TONS of sushi options and other burgers that I'm looking forward to trying...so I'm sure to be back very soon!",

The music is too loud indoors for pleasant conversation, but that seems to be the standard these days no matter where you go.  The food is excellent; I love the make-your-own-roll sushi.  I am also extremely fond of the lobster spring roll appetizer, which is to die for.  The service has always been polite and reasonably swift.  That said, the ladies' room is EXTREMELY unpleasant-- it's clean, but while you're in there, a loud, jarring, mocking recording yells at you while you try to use the facilities.  I will definitely go back, but I won't use their restrooms except in the case of a dire emergency.",

    "text": "The name is interesting in itself \"Cowfish,\" as it hints that it serves both steak and seafood.  I was in Charlotte for business and my BF and I wanted to come here as it is the most reviewed restaurant in the city.  We specifically went for sushi, although they have tons of menu items to choose from.    The restaurant is very large with a full bar.  It's located next door to a mall and right off a busy street.  We dined on a Monday evening and was overwhelmed with the menu.  This place has everything from burgers to steaks to sandwiches to sushi, including their infamous \"BurgSushi\" creations which fuses burgers and sushi together.  They have sushi with burger meat inside, and they'll make a burger out of sushi ingredients.  However you can imagine to mix burgers and sushi, this place managed to do it.  We started off with an enormous serving of calamari which was pretty average.  The sweet chilli sauce was not a great dip to go with the calamari.  If the restaurant could get their hands on a chipotle aioli sauce, it would be game over.    I ordered the recommended Taste Explosion ($15) which is one of their BurgSushi items, made up of Angus ground beef, applewood bacon, jalapenos, spicy mayo inside, coated with tempura flakes. Topped with tomato and cheese, and drizzled with pesto.  It truly was a taste explosion. Something very different and unique, and delicious at the same time.  My boyfriend got a couple of \"normal\" sushi rolls which were also delicious.  I sipped on a China Blossom martini which was also delightful with the meal.  This was a wonderful place to grab dinner no matter what you're craving.  This is the perfect place for a group of people that have a wide range of palettes.  Unlike most sushi restaurants, if you don't like sushi, you're not just confined to a bento box which is great.  Definitely would come back again if I were to find myself back in Charlotte for work.",

Great customer service! ----------- I enjoy the Cowfish, this has been a frequent stop mostly on business travels or to take a client out to dinner.  I stopped in recently on a Thursday evening (early evening about 5pm). Service was friendly, I sat at the bar.  Food was ok but not as good as usual.  I got a little creative and ordered off the Burgushi menu, where I should have stuck with just sushi selections.  Had a mix of mini burgers and a spicy sushi roll.  I added some nigiri tuna which was quite good.  Overall I give the visit a B or B+.  Could be since I was there early they weren't quite in stride for dinner service.",

The waitress was very helpful with her recommendations and explaining the menu options.   The crab dip was decent but we could do without the overloaded sauce on the chips.  My husband had sushi which he liked and I had bourgoushi (not sure if I spelled it right).  It was different but nothing to write home about.  Basically pieces of a cheeseburger wrapped in a tater tot and cut like sushi (photo attached).  Here comes the issue... we ordered desert as it was my birthday celebration. The table next to us with about 5 ladies started to panic and packed all their things to rush out.  I asked one of the ladies what was going on and she said it was a mouse.  We were dining on the patio.  I don't eat with mice so I left as well and waited out front for my family.  I asked my husband to get the check and desert wrapped to go.  I told the hostesses up front and she laughed. She said \"oh that's mr. Pickles and he lives back there.  There is nothing we can do about it. The manager knows.\"  What!?! You are ok with mice around your restaurant?  Will not be back.  Sorry.  The only thing the manager did was give us coupons to come back and get $5 off of $20 spend.  Thanks but no thanks. Any restaurant ok with mice near guests eating will not have my business.",

    "text": "I need a place like this at home. My girlfriend doesn't like sushi and I love it. We would be able to come here and she could get a burger and I could get some delicious sushi.  On a Saturday afternoon this place was packed. There was about a 20 minute wait when I arrived, but luckily there was a single seat at the bar that I was able to grab, skipping the line. I was greeted quickly by one of the bartenders and handed a menu. He grabbed me a glass of water while I hunted through the large list of drinks.  I landed on The Hershey Swiss spiked milkshake ($10). Its a chocolate shake with booze in it. What's not to like? It was delicious and a nice change from all the beer I had been drinking through the week.  The menu here is quite large. Take a great burger place that has tons of options and mix it with a sushi place that has a healthy choice of rolls, then add some specialties that make this restaurant unique and you can start to see how the menu can get long. Now we're not saying its like reading War and Peace just to get a meal here. The menu is organized and clear, you just might have to get the server over to help narrow down your choices.  I went with their \"Burgushi\" specialty and chose the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich with a side of their Thai Cucumbers ($14). The sandwich was a blackened seared rare Ahi tuna, sliced up and was topped with bacon, tomato salsa, jalapenos, and slaw. Their \"bun\" is cool. Its rice and kani (crab) wrapped in rice paper. Its then grilled to give it a texture like you would expect from a traditional bun.  The sandwich was great, though a little messy. The bacon gave the sandwich a nice crunchy texture to go against the soft tuna so you don't feel like you're eating a sandwich of mush. I didn't really get any flavour from the tomato salsa or slaw, but there was some nice heat on the back end from the jalapenos. The Thai cucumbers were excellent and had a nice spiciness to them.  For $30 including the tip this was a great weekend lunch.",

Kristen went over each section and we were able to make some great choices.   For an appetizer we had the lobster crab spring rolls... #Amazing. The presentation and the flavor was perfect.  If it's your first time I highly recommend the Bento Box it has sushi and a burger along with some of the signature side items.   Absolutely loved everything about this place including the art on the walls! See you soon CowFish.",

The food was great, the sushi was so fresh, best I've ever had.  The service was great and the staff was courteous and attentive.  The vibe, for a Sunday evening, was impressive.  We would go there again anytime.  Highly recommended.",

The crab (cooked) sushi is really good.   It was loud for us on a Sunday at lunch. Concrete floors make it louder. Lotta pots banging and the noise level was too high so you had to speak very loud to hear your guest. Would have been so much nicer if they would have designed it so materials would absorb the noise level.  Maybe we will sit outside next time.",

You'll be texted a unique cartoon fish when you check in and can watch your fish float around a virtual fish tank. The bigger he gets, the closer you are to getting a table.  The food is good but their menu is a bit large and overwhelming.  The Lobster and Crab Spring Rolls are a delicious appetizer. Try something different here and you'll likely enjoy the unique blend of favors.  They offer traditional sushi but, unique to this place, their sushi-esque options (Burgushi) are what we always go for.  The rolls are large enough to share so, if you go as a couple, split a burger and a unique \"sushi\" roll.  We enjoyed The Primetime Filet and Lobster Roll and CBCLT burger.  It was a ton of food for two people.  This restaurant has a large outdoor seating area and, if it's not warm out, they'll have the plastic curtains down and heaters on.",

You could almost split one order for two people.  Last time, I tried the bento box with sliders. You get a very tiny portion of high-quality ground beef, with lighter Japanese fare. I did not leave engorged, and it was the perfect amount of food.  My wife gets the 'build-your-own' sushi, which is very consistently good.   I love the ambiance, which is very Not-Southern. My only 'beef' is that it's damn near impossible to get a table at peak dinner time. We come early (before 12n) on workdays to grab a table. Service is usually prompt and speedy if you avoid the weekend dinner crowd.",

    "text": "I know, I know.  Technically I'm not supposed to review a place where I have a \"relationship\" with the restaurant...but c'mon. It's not like I'm married to any emploee... I have a sushi roll named after me here. (The Neon Dion, seriously my favorite roll.)  I went through a period of time where I dined-in or got take out 3 times a week and know their stuff...so I MUST write a review!  Since there are SO many reviews here so I'll just put in my 2 cents and tips.   Make reservations EARLY.  Yes, there can be a 1 to 2 hour wait...even for the bar.  But there's a reason why.  The food is fresh, eclectic, and WORKS.  The service is also spot on. If you have an issue with a menu item or if it's super busy and gets delivered to the wrong place, someone will find a solution for you, and do it graciously.  Marcus and Alan take great care in who they hire and keep a good staff.    Do not be intimidated by the multitude of choices.  Ask your server what he/she recommends, and I promise you'll be steered in the right direction.   SUSHI: The rolls are ENORMOUS.  (The prices can veer toward $20+ but you'll get what you pay for.) If you're cutting carbs, or just prefer a little less rice, order brown or \"Light Rice\".  I also suggest getting your roll cut into 10 pieces, so you can fit each piece in your mouth a little more comfortably.   Bento Box is really the way to go to sample it all and get a FANTASTIC value.  A tiny slider of the day or classic slider, a smaller 4 piece version of a regular roll, or \"specialty\" shrimp tempura/Mark's (deep fried w/tuna + cream cheese) roll, edamame, sweet potato or regular fries, Thai cucumber salad (which is sweet, tangy and crisp) and   The spiked shakes are creative and a fun alternative (Cold Cactus: ice cream, silver tequila, creme de menth, whipped cream, chocolate shavings? WOAH Nelly!)   Check Facebook and their site for updates on specials like $5 martini nights and any special promotions.    I could write a three-part series on the Cowfish, but instead, I say, JUST GO!  You won't regret it.",

We waited nearly 90 minutes to get seated.   Aside from the wait, the food was excellent. I the Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love burger and must say it was awesome!

We walked in late the other night and the hostess looked incredibly confused that we wanted to be seated at a table instead of the bar. But apparently she wasn't able to seat us?!?  Hopped on two stools at the bar and ordered glasses of water. Food was simple: Parmesan truffle fries with bacon on the side, a Neon Dion roll for the Mr, and for me, the green monster burger with their veggie burger instead of beef.  The fries were impressive. As in...we ate them all unapologetically.  It was probably my third time ordering the green monster with a veggie burger, and this time I asked for the bun on the side. Didn't want to miss out on even a forkful of the action. As a side, I went with the cucumbers.   Let's just say that I looked like a quasi-homeless person scooping burger and cucumber into my face with reckless abandon. It's just so good.  So sure, go to The Cowfish. But don't freak out if you have a half-hour wait because it's so popular. Also, don't freak out if the service is a bit nonchalant. Ultimately, the food is solid.",

This was quite tasty, but I didn't understand why they cream cheese was a blob on one side of the mini burger instead of distributed more evenly. The sushi was quite...meh. I chose the blackened tuna roll. It was trying too hard and didn't quite hit the spot. The guacamole on top was just weird. The cucumber salad was tasty, but more pickle flavored. Edamame was well cooked, but again the chef just tosses a ton of salt in one place. I chose sweet potato fries which were quite perfect! I'd definitely return for another burger, but would probably avoid sushi in the future though I wish it wasn't so over priced. Beer selection is nice.",

The sushi was spot on! the burgers were huge and the apps! ahh I want to go back again!!  The  specialty rolls were huge and great for their prices 9 huge maki pieces that can be for a meal; however, my fat self ate it was an app hehehe.   The staff was super nice, you can tell they love what they do and they enjoy working there... and you can def tell they love the food there. I don't blame them!  The pricing was not bad at all! for 1 tempura roll, 1 specialty roll, the lobster and crab eggrolls, a bento box, and the jalapeno popper show stopper all for only $72 not bad at all!   I would def recommend you people to come here when they are in Charlotte, it fun, its good, and youll enjoy what you order.   Can't wait to go back to Charlotte just for this place... or Orlando, because a new one is being built there now.",

Yesterday was the first time I'd tried anything other than the sushi or burgushi and was, of course happy with my meal. I think I could eat sushi everyday so for me to order a burger instead was a tough decision. I had the lamb burger, it was awesome! Sushi wise, the Southpark roll ( I think they've renamed it) and the Georgia roll are my favorites....I've never had a bad roll there and have tried many. This is my go to spot when friends come in and aren't as lucky to have one close to them.   Pros:  Fresh sushi Creative menu Great tasting food...sushi/burgers/burgushi  Great drink selections  Trendy atmosphere Heated patio  Food portion Etc...  Cons: (nothing major)  Sushi prices are a little high...but fresh and very tasteful.  The wait there is still long, which from a business prospective isn't a bad thing....it's crazy to me that as long as the place has been open there's still a hour wait at 7 on a Tuesday night. They should have more call ahead/reservation options.  Parking",

    "text": "Cowfish is a great atmospheric concept. Significant bar, patio, and menu.  This place has transformed from a Charlotte Flavor-of-the-Month to a Southpark standard in just a few years. It remains a destination where everyone smiles because they are so happy to be sitting there, and has ridiculous wait times. Ridiculous.   In case you are unfamiliar, we in Charlotte tend to lose our minds over new establishments. We get excited about each of the six \"Grand Openings\" these places have, and we flock to them salaciously for a few months before we either:  a) lose interest  b) realize we don't like them, or  c) realize we don't like the people we keep seeing there.   Often, these establishments crawl off to die upon this occurrence.   Due to the nature of such establishments in such locations in this town, I wondered when the luster would fade on Cowfish. It hasn't. People are still waiting an hour and a half to sit down at 5pm on a rainy Tuesday.  What is truly great about Cowfish: The menu. It is extensive and very well-designed, replete with fun names and several regional specific (\"Pittsburgoo-shi Sandwich,\" \"Georgia Roll\") and local-themed (\"Southpark Roll,\" \"Foreplay Roll\") items.   This menu is pages and pages long, containing a variety of burgers, sushi, sandwiches and salads. The focus, as the name says, is on burgers and sushi, and for one page, they are combined as \"Burgushi.\" Regardless of his legal status within the county limits, WWE personality Ric Flair is featured in the Burgushi with \"The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi...Roll\".   Among the burgers, \"The Arnold Hamandegger\" is a mammoth construction with meat and more meat. A half-pound beef burger with cheese, ham, egg, bacon and onions on it. Took me a few days to finish. Came as advertised, was delectable and not good for you.  Bento Boxes are a great choice - you get sushi (choose between several rolls), a mini-burger, edamame, sweet potato fries and Thai cucumbers.    If there's an issue I wish to discuss, it's this: Cowfish's specialty rolls are just so heavy.   The sushi chef seems intent on overloading these. If it doesn't have a creamy sauce or cream cheese in it, it's fried to a degree or has something fried on it or in it. And five or six of them have jalapenos. Jalapenos?",

The patrons dress ranged from shorts and a golf shirt to slacks and dresses. You will feel comfortable here!  For appetizers we had the crab rangoon dip and the seared steak tataki. I loved the dip and my wife did too. The seared steak tataki had steak, scallops, yellowtail, and tuna that was seared on the outside and raw on the inside. Not my kinda thing, bit my wife LOVED it.   For the entrees I had the taste explosion roll (on the advice of a  fellow Yelper) and my wife had the filet and lobster roll. We both ate until we thought we'd pop! These were great choices, but beware, her steak was again seared on the outside, rare or raw inside. That's something she loved.  David (complete with a handlebar moustache) was an EXCELLENT server. David took the time to explain things and make recommendations. All of his advice was 100% correct. He even had the chef make a few alterations at our request. He is fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Ask for him!",

Let us try all the various drafts before we decided, Chris also gave us a bunch of other spots to check out in the area and throughout town, plus potential neighborhoods (told him we were considering moving here). Started with burgushi the buffalo one... Let me say, WOW. Absolutely delicious. After that, I had the jalapeno shooter burger while man friend had the hunka hunka (bacon, peanut butter, banana). Both were tasty! I wasn't sure about fries or coleslaw, they let me split, thanks for that! Turned out I prefer the bacon coleslaw, very good. He had the sweet potato grid and said they might be the best he's had. Overall, loving this place, they're opening one in Atlanta by Perimeter Mall. Can't say enough good things about the experience, other than thank you for the great service and food!",

A little chatty, but can't fault the dude for going all out.  Anyways, started with shishito peppers and spicy poke dip.  Both were great, and when we ran out of the wonton chips, the waiter brought us some more.  For dinner I had the Thundering Herd Bison Burger and my gf the Honey, Brie Mine.  Both were also very well done and I thought the combination of toppings was well proportioned so I did not end up with any flavor that over powered the others.  I will be coming here again, gonna try some of the sush next",

    "text": "Here is a GREAT Burger!  First I'll start at the beginning!  Or at least the beginning of my first meal here!  I was so hungry I wanted to order some food just so my brain would function well enough to order the rest of the Meal (maybe a Burger)    Near the top of the menu I saw the Onion Rings, noticing they were \"Thick Cut\" I was tempted to get them anyway because they had a \"Panko Coconut\" Batter (I did not order them this first time).  As hungry as I was I would almost say it was a miracle that I read enough of the Appetizers to see one called \"Sticks, Sweets and Strings\" so I interrogated my Great Waiter about this and he told me that I could skip the \"Sticks\" (which are plain Fries - Probably a great move - I would rather write 5 star reviews than any other).  Great suggestion!  These Sweet Potato Fries were the BEST I have eaten up to this point in my life!  The Onion Straws (super thin sliced and lightly battered onion rings) were the BEST Onion Straws/Rings I have had in a Restaurant! !! !!!  The Burger was Excellent!  I ordered it Medium Well (I think and I think the Chef was reading my mind though I did not meet the Chef until he brought my Burger to me).  Here is your flavor clue and it should be a BIG Clue: I intentionally ordered this Burger topped with only Red Onion, Pickles and a Bun in order to TASTE the Burger!  If a Burger is GREAT it should be able to \"stand on its own\" this one Stood well! !! !!  Incredible Flavor and PERFECTLY Cooked, an EASY 5 yelp stars!  Onion Straws (now my \"Onion Ring\" list won't be so lonely) an Easy 5 stars!  Sweet Potato Fries: Best I've eaten so far... 5 yelp stars!  Fried Pickles, hummm maybe 3 stars compared to the other food here.  Cowfish looks great and the service is excellent!  I did not pay attention to the prices until it was time to pay and I was expecting my bill to be more, so I checked it (everything was there)!  For the Volume and Quality this is a GREAT VALUE! !! !!!  That is why it is easy for me to say I will eat here again and soon!  If you are in the restroom and you want some restroom humor you will probably get some if you are in there long enough to wash your hands and you can ignore the signs, (well maybe pay attention until you get where you are going) though the signs are pretty cool too!  Where they need help:  The Desserts could be Much, MUCH more creative!  Cowfish has put so much Creative Geniusry in the first part of their menu, the choices for Desserts and Coffee make it easy to pass!  I bet most people need an excuse for Dessert (NOT me) though I'm not ordering Dessert just for another photo.  It has to be good and I expect something Totally Unique from a place that has used their imagination so well on the mains!  Minor Point: If you have never had Masala Chai you may enjoy this one.  What they served me was very good tasting Hot Spiced Tea and better than what most Indian restaurant call Masala Chai, yet what Cowfish calls Masala Chai is a far scream from what I have experienced as truly great Masala Chai.  Even so, what they served me had great flavor for hot tea.  Tiny point:  the BBQ sauce was good (I had Three small dishes of it), though I expected it to be as good as everything else!  This is a tiny point to me because this is not a BBQ joint, though I did put it on my: Sweet Potato Fries, Burger and Onion strings!",

Located near the mall and in a very nice area Cowfish is an ideal place to grab lunch or dinner.  We had no wait but we got seated towards the back where all the kitchen commotion was. A bit loud and not as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of the restaurant we dealt with it. Our server was a bit cold and not as hospitable as other places we visited in North Carolina.  We started off with appetizers. The seaweed salad was nicely presented in a glass and was tasty. The Parmesan truffle fries was huge! The portion was more than enough for three people. We couldn't even get halfway through the fries. The truffle flavor wasn't there and was overpowered by the bacon bits. I also got a salmon skin hand roll which isn't too different from any other Japanese restaurants.  My group also ordered two bento boxes. Each bento box included a slider of the week, sushi, sweet potato fries, edamame, and a cucumber salad. The slider was less than stellar. Too much goat cheese and not enough of everything else. I felt like I was just eating cheese. The sushi was alright not anything out of the ordinary. The sweet potato fries were outstanding though!   If i'm ever in this area again i'll probably make a trip back to this place. But don't consider driving far just because the concept is alluring.",

    "text": "My family and I moved from New York to Charlotte about 9 years ago, and coming from a city full of great food options, we were looking for good places to eat in Charlotte. The Cowfish was among the first restaurants that came highly recommended by residents of Charlotte. We went there multiple times in the beginning, and we always left happy and satisfied, from the great burgers to the interesting concept of Burgushi.  However, time has not been too kind to The Cowfish. The last three visits have been underwhelming, and the last visit I made is what caused me to update my initial review. During this visit, I ordered the Thundering Herd Bison Burger and had Parmesan Bacon Truffle Fries as an appetizer. I will begin with my thoughts on the fries.  When the fries arrived, the cheese had already somewhat cooled down, meaning that the fries were stuck together. It was way too chewy and rubbery in texture, which is how cheese is when it isn't hot and melted. Yes, I could have asked the waiter to warm the fries up more, but the food shouldn't be served like this.  Concerning the Bison Burger, I ordered it in Medium-Rare because that is how I enjoy my burgers. However, this burger was too undercooked in that the burger was falling apart in my hands. The taste of the meat was similar to what I have tasted from a Kirkland Signature burger that was microwaved. The burger was very rubbery and overtly chewy.  I didn't order a Burgushi this visit, but I did order this dish last time around. I was disappointed because the meat tasted like over cooked ground beef used in fast food tacos.  I don't mean to complain and rant about The Cowfish with this review. I still enjoy their dessert options very much, and the service is consistently amazing. Plus, the ambience and decor of the restaurant is very unique, with the right character to fit the American-Japanese fashion vibe. I am just explaining how the food tasted, and that there are many better (and cheaper) options around Charlotte if you crave burgers or sushi. This is probably the only place where you can have both. So, the choice is yours, but my choice would be to go somewhere else.",

Even after they brought me back some fresh fries they still weren't good. The 1st order was cold and tasteless the 2nd was hot and hard. Maybe it was because they were changing shifts. Not sure just didn't complain after the 2nd fries came to the table.  However I really appreciate the management reaching out to me and having concerns about my order not being up to their standards. Thumbs up for prompt attention. I'm hoping my next visit will be like my first visit there.",

I wanted to like the food, but only the crab dip was thel most memorable dish of the evening. The lobster roll was ok, and the burger-sushi hybrid was just a tad too oily for my taste. My dinner companion also wasn't terribly impressed with the burger. Our server was awesome, but not quite enough to make up for the food. That said, I will definitely still come back and try other dishes. This place just seems too fun to give up on the first try.   Update: I love that their Marketing Director reached out to follow up on my review. I am liking this place a lot more, and can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu when I'm back in town!",

    "text": "Cowfish has the potential to be something really special but it just falls a little short. And, I can't quite put my finger on what the problem is... (Helpful, I know.) I'm not sure if it's the humorless staff or sterile location by the mall. The fact that they make you wait 20-minutes for a table despite 10 empty tables within view. Or, maybe it's the super creative and appetizing menu descriptions that don't quite match the food you're brought. I dunno. It could be a little bit of all of that. But, moral of that story is, I always go in excited, with high hopes and leave slightly underwhelmed.   On my most recent visit, I ordered the sashimi - nigiri combo. A decent deal at $23 it included 8-pieces of spicy tuna, 3-pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon and yellow tail) and 6-pieces of sashimi (3 salmon, 3 tuna). It was good. Incredibly fresh fish! But, lacked some creativity or pizazz. Ted got the short rib burger. I had a taste and liked it -- it had something sweet in the mix, maybe figs or dried cherries? He wasn't super impressed. Fries were cold.   All in all, I wish Cow Fish would find a way to kick it up a notch or two and impress more. It really could be the perfect combo for me and Ted -- I could live on sushi and he is a total sucker for a good burger.",

But where they really shine and offer something you can't find anywhere else is a combination of these foods- the burgushi!  I can't get enough of it!  I waited til my third visit to try it, and I wish I had ordered it from the beginning.  I can't really describe the burgushi well enough for it to make sense, but just try it!  It's delicious.    The service I've gotten here has always been good.  I can't recall an occasion that I've had any issues with it.  The servers are typically friendly and attentive without being intrusive.

Today was my husbands birthdah and we decided that if we went around 4:30-5, the wait wouldn't be so bad! And I was RIGHT!!   Upon arrival, the doors were opened for us and we were greeted by a few employees. We were seated right away and were so excited! Our server was Jordyn/Jordan. I don't know which way it's spelt but SHE was wonderful. She had a great and friendly personality. She was ready to help us in any way. She let us take our time to figure out what we wanted to order. During our time there... we had a few other employees come to our table and ask how everything was and making sure we didn't need anything. That is great service! It wasn't too much and it was greatly appreciated.   We got a few appetizers. My husband wanted to try the calamari and I wanted to try the fries with bacon and truffle sauce. My husband ordered the Bento Box for his meal and I ordered Sushi! Not your average kind of sushi... see, I don't eat seafood or much meat. It depends on how it's cooked and what it is. I have always wanted to try sushi but without the fish. Which I know may sound ridiculous but I was feeling left out. At this restaurant.... you get to PICK what goes in it and they have other options like ground beef and pulled pork!!!! I was SOOO excited to finally get to try it! I asked our server if it was okay to order some things even if it sounded weird!! She assured me that they don't judge and it's whatever I would like, they would make it happen! At this point, I was super excited. In my sushi... I had... pulled pork, bacon, cream cheese, mushroom and avocado. And OH MY GOD!!!!!! It was amazing!!!!! My husband loved his food. I loved mine! It was a great meal for both of us.   I can't wait to come back here! I know there are other things to try, but I think I just found my new spot that accepts my sushi handicap!!! Thanks for making this experience such a blast! Now I finally got to see why this place has such great reviews! Highly recommend and we WILL be back!",

    "text": "When I first moved to Charlotte 6 years ago, Cowfish was the jam! It was a unique restaurant that really stood apart from the others - 6 years later I think that's still True, even with all the new places that pop up daily. Each time I come here, the service and food has been exceptional!   Although I've never tried the burgushi, their sushi is top notch! My favorite hands down is the typical storm. It's so fresh and at around $20 - it's definitely filling as the roll is HUGE! Im also a sucker for the bento box. It's the best value, plus you get a mix of options - a little 4 piece sushi roll, mini slider, cucumbers (which are to DIE for!!), sweet potato fries and edamame. You can't go wrong for just around $12-$15! You can also substitute your side - including friend pickles, bacon coleslaw, veggies, seaweed salad or regular fries!   And if you're looking for something different to start off your meal- you gotta get the crab rangoon dip! It's so delicious and served with light wanton crips and a sweet/spicy glaze.  Overall you can't go wrong with anything here - from the burgers, sandwiches, sushi- they have it all. And tip- 1/2 off wine bottles on Wednesday - dining or bar area!",

    "text": "I've never heard of this food combo at a restaurant so I was a little skeptical, but it ended up being amazing! The menu is overwhelming with how many food items they have. My recommendation is to try the sushi, a burger or slider, and the burgooshi. This way you can try a little bit of everything.  We ordered the bento box so that we would get a taste of multiple menu items. The bento box came with a slider, 4 sushi pieces, sweet potato fries, edamame, and cumbers. The slider was so good and it made me wish we ordered a whole burger. Th Mark's sushi pieces were good, but not my favorite. Everything else in the bento box was great!   We also ordered the bison burgooshi. The concept is unique to have non sushi food in a sushi roll and it was a success.   The TNT sushi roll was our favorite. It has great flavor and tasted fresh.   We have heard the wait here is very long on weekends so it is recommended to go on a week day.  Overall, great service, great food! Save room for a milkshake because they looked delicious!",

    "text": "After seeing a pic of their \"Burgushi\", I just had to have it...so here I was again!  I hit this fun, hot spot for a late lunch (2 pmish?), and surprisingly, there were still a good number of people there. Still, there were a lot of good, empty seats. Yet the hostess leads me to a seat in the back, right next to the cashier stand, next to the swinging doorway to the patio...not to mention right beside a group of loud, giggling teenagers. *SIGH* Just the worst possible seating for someone like me...who prefers to be AWAY from doorways and super-loud people lol! This is such a pet peeve of mine at restaurants. I get it if there aren't any other seats available, but why lead a customer to the worst seat when there are plenty of good seats open?!? I truly don't get this...and it truly ticks me off. Still, I was determined not to be a Bitch, so decided not to ask to be reseated in another area...though I did ask for a booth.  THAT aside, I decided to go ahead and order the much-anticipated \"The All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi\" with Truffle Fries.  First of all, KUDOS for the sweet presentation of the Cheeseburgooshi. It's also such an ingenious idea! I mean, how can you NOT love this?? Well, here's the deal. As much as I love the idea, the name and the look of this Cheeseburgooshi, it didn't quite live up to it. Meaning, it just didn't taste as good as it looked. The bacon and the beef just didn't taste that great...and there were barely any cheese (if at all?) in it, though a heavy sprinkle of pickles. As the for the Truffle Fries, it didn't taste fresh. In fact, it was barely warm. So sadly, the meal was disappointing...though I did manage to get some great pics for the Instagram lol! Next time, think I'll stick with Sushi or Burger...not a combo of both (though it sounds so cool!).  Despite the hefty price points, I couldn't even finish eating all of the Cheeseburgooshi and the Truffle Fries...so decided to order a dessert in its place. The dessert I chose was the comically named \"Chef Dave's Not Factory Made Cheesecake\" (What a slap in the face for Cheesecake Factory lol!)...and thankfully, the Cheesecake was really good. Super-rich and flavorful. I loved the sprinkle of Coconut flakes, but didn't love the Raspberry sauce. If only they had this Cheesecake with Blueberry sauce instead...  The service was OK. The waitress was friendly enough, yet not super-attentive. I had to ask another staff member that happened to be walking by for an Iced Tea refill.   Overall, I can't say that the dining experience was great. The food was good enough (though a tad disappointing), but honestly, it was just too annoying having to deal with the doors opening and closing every few minutes, the giggling teenagers next to me...and the waiters/waitresses walking back and forth in front of my table to get to the cashier all throughout my meal. *UGGGH*   For some reason, something seems to be amiss with Cowfish and me. As much as I love this restaurant, there's always something that gets in the way of all-out enjoyment. For more than three occasions, I had to ditch the line due to the long wait. Then, I had this one occasion when my supposedly fancy, sixteen-dollar appetizer came out looking like a sloppy mess (though the management was really good about compensating me for this!). And now, this super-annoying seating situation (and other disappointments). I hate to do it, but I really can't rate this experience more than three stars. :\\  No matter, I'm not going to give up on Cowfish just yet. Hopefully, sometime in the future, I'll actually get everything I want from this restaurant!",

Great flavor, awesome sauces, and the perfect blend between Asian and All-American. Served with fries... I've had better. Overall, I'll be back for the food! The service was just okay...had to end up asking another server for a refill. I wasn't impressed with our server..he wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't describe him as attentive.

Favorite appetizer is to Togarashi Shrimp. Nice and crisp and the sauce on top is just delicious and you get a nice little salad underneath the shrimp.  The Lobster spring roll is also very good. Sashimi pieces are nice and thick. They also give you fresh wasabi with the sashimi dish, which is awesome.   I've tried a number of different rolls here as well and they've all been consistently good. Favorite os the rigg's crabcake roll.  Service is generally very good.  Management always has a great attitude.  This is our goto place for Sushi.",

Great service on Father's Day Sunday, delicious food, and colorful atmosphere that was a nice escape from the heat outside.   I went for their bento box and they obviously know they have a good concept, as it was just the right balance of flavors. I'm not a big buffet fan, but the bento box is like your own little version of a buffet...or a conglomeration of small plates, whatever suites your fancy.   We also ordered the pickles and peppers appetizer and both were perfectly fried! Gotta appreciate quality pickle chip fries, as it is easy to have them be soggy.   Our waiter could have been an intimidating figure - 6ft and built like Dave Bautista, but he was the most welcoming, attentive person one could ask for as a waiter. This guy likes staying in good physical shape, but he clearly cares just as much about making sure you have an enjoyable meal!  Don't let the parking turn you off, there is a deck with plenty of spaces just a few steps away. Good job Cowfish.",

Another bartender came over asked what the drink was and made another one. He was so nice about the situation. He even brought the drink outside to our table. The server outside was amazing as well.

    "text": "Sorry to be the party pooper, but this is not our style or preference.  An interesting concept:  the marriage of a hamburger joint with a sushi place.  Their menu is a work of art.  Regular array of sushi and sashimi and some good combinations, esp those that are non-seafood.  Like the vindaloo lamb sushi roll that my wife had.  Of course, she did not like the seaweed wrapper inside, so put that aside.  But otherwise is was acceptable to her.  The burger list is, likewise, very cleaver.  All are half pounders and they do have a full pound offering that is like the \"hunky dunky\" or some such name.  It is a GIANT burger.  I had the black truffle burger and it was good, but too rich for my ancient taste buds.  Understand that this place was very crowded.  Our son suggested that we git in by 5pm.  We did and had to be seated out back in the tented patio area.  The dining area was mobbed!  Judging my the very high ratings, the under 50 year old set, especially the 20 - 30 year oldsters, find the crowded eclectic menu and setting to their liking.  It was too much for us.  The noise level drowns out any conversation at your table and sitting in the wind tunnel formed by the tented patio location open at each end, plus the roar of the multiple ceiling fans, made the meal an ordeal.  And...due to the crowded to overflowing mob of eaters, the kitchen was punching out the meals at a good rate.  What suffered was the fried potatoes and other to-be warm sides which arrived lukewarm and soggy.  They sit too long to be picked up by the hustling wait staff who do a great job but as you walk by the pick up window of the kitchen are quite a gaggle awaiting their orders to deliver.  But they do a good job.  Special kudos to a male busser who was a dynamo in clearing tables and carrying two arms full of dishes, etc. through the twin doors leading to the interior.  He would use his elbows to open them and he did so without dropping anything.  Sweat head that he was, he was the star of the constantly in-motion support staff.  It was a birthday for our daughter-in-law and I took on the just under $200 bill, which included $8 for her birthday dessert.  And so much for the banging of cymbal and drum accompanied staff serenade. Do it at home.  We were laughing all the way home as to how so many found this crazy eating environment a wonderful experience.  But we apparently did not get it and Cowfish does.  Give this a try and see for yourself.  They do a good job, A-OK, for what they do and offer.",

    "text": "Amazing joint with outstanding food and service. This is not a place to be missed while you are in Charlotte. Very comfortable atmosphere with generous indoor and outdoor seating. The menu is extensive enough to satisfy every palate imaginable. The only ding was that our dish of calamari was a bit over cooked and when the waitress noticed that we were not eating it, she took it back. Several minutes later, the chef delivered a fresh portion for the 5 of us along with an apology and said it was \"on the house\". What a great gesture and a True reflection of the high standards found here. I will definitely be back.",

The ingredients are a1 and the service is good even when they are busy. We are always checked on by different people not just our server. We got the Crab Rangoon dip. We ate it to the last drop, if they made these in the store I would definitely buy it. I haven't got a dessert here yet though, that is the next thing I need to try, I always get super full before it. I will update my review if I ever get there lol. We will definitely be back!",

Minutes after putting in our appetizers they were on the table ready for us to enjoy. We had the coconut onion rings and crab rangoon dip. SO delicious and the onion rings were gigantic! Our server was very nice and funny and attentive. He noticed we liked a particular dipping sauce and brought more without being asked and even packed some in our to go boxes later that night.  All the menu items seemed so interesting and delicious it was hard choosing. I had the longhorn burger with fried pickles. You can really customize your burger exactly how you want it: bread, cheese, meat, toppings, sauces. I recommend the wasabi mayo. They also have build your own sushi. We had the berry cheesecake and orange ginger creme brulee. The brulee was to die for. So full of taste and such a big portion! Great fun place!

I suspect the burgers are pre done and finished off when ordered, YUCK!  Also the calamari was really chewy.  The sushi was great though, but its pretty loud in there.

After asking the bartender to find out what went wrong, he either ignored me or forgot.  Food was fine and the table wait staff was good.

Will proably give them another chance based on food prep but a repeat by the bar and the management will result in a significantly more negative review.",

The first time I walked out as I was with a large group, but the second time I was just with one friend so we ponied up at the bar to eat.    The menu is huge with a burger, sushi and burgushi ( a combo of both) options.  The bartender took the time to walk us through the menu even though it was crowded which I really appreciated.    We split the Green Monster Burger and the Mother Load sushi platter.  The Green Monster was delicious and they did a great job of cooking the burger to medium (what most people think as medium rare).  It had creamy avacado and fried jalapeno slices. Great combination of hot burger and cool avacados.  I would go to this place just for the burger!    The motherload sushi platter was great, it was a good sized portion and the fish tasted very fresh.    Great place, I'll definitely be back.  (it didn't hurt that Ric Flair sat next to me)",

Atmosphere: It's a good sit down spot that attracts a sophisticated crowd without being stuffy.  On my second visit they had live music outside, the guy was pretty good and did well known covers.  If you're going in the evening make a reservation, wait times can be horrific, 1hr+. Weekends you might be able to walk in and dine.   The food: The menu is MASSIVE.  I'm talking 11 point font, double-sided, 10 page menus.  If you're the type that likes to return to a place and sample from all over...well it's not happening here unless you bring friends and share.  Which brings me to the topic of this place being a fusion eatery.  Thankfully both the sushi and the burgers are good. I enjoy sushi and like to eat it frequently.  I am not however, someone who says sushi doesn't exist outside of *insert the name of a city in another part of the country*.  Throwing that out there in case someone says the sushi at Cowfish isn't \"real sushi.\"  I haven't tried the \"Burgushi\" - it's Burger elements placed into sushi or the sandwiches with sushi elements placed into them, although I've heard good things.  The various rolls I have tried and the house burger (which you can customize the daylights out of) were both good.  I suggest the burger as a nice standby for friends that aren't quite ready to dive into sushi beyond a piece or two.    All in all:  It's a great place for anyone who loves sushi or burgers or for someone who is trying to get their burger eating friends to try sushi.",

And The Cowfish? Well let's just say that it's got serious potential to possibly send every other restaurant in town out of business and cure cancer. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD.  After coming here a few times on a few different nights, I have yet to find anything I don't eat, see or hear that makes me go \"Wow...\". From the service (Channon is one of the managers and went above, beyond and around the corner to make an order right for us one night), to the decor (so Japanese/modern/fun/dark/chic/simple - if that's possible?), to the food (Shut the Front Door Good!), it's just a fact that The Cowfish is really just that good.  Reservations are only accepted for 1/3 of the place, so they're hard to get but I've never had a problem strolling up to the bar and getting a seat. If that's not your thing, they encourage you to call ahead and get a feel for the wait time. Whatever it is, though, wait. It's worth it :)  We've tried the Summer rolls (4 to an order, with a few great fried chips plus a savory, light chili sauce for dipping) as well as the Crab Ragoon dip and both were top notch. So good you will consider ordering them as meals the next time you come in!  The Burgiri is just an orgasm in your mouth waiting to happen. So just try it and thank me later, OK? The actual sushi rolls are the freshest I've tasted in Charlotte - between the basic rolls (cali, philly) and the more complex specialty rolls, they're beautiful, well constructed and amazingly flavorful. A tip would be to ask the waiter to have it cut into 10 pieces - the rolls are a bit too big otherwise to fit in one bite!  I have not had the milkshakes yet, but will make that my priority when I go back (again) tonight!   Ah, it's admittedly hard for me to write this review - can words truly fail me? I believe so - the moral of the story is go. Go try The Cowfish. Run, Drive and Speed towards in as soon as you can.",

    "text": "The Cowfish is a very unique restaurant that incorporates sushi and hamburgers. You can order sushi or burgers depending on what you prefer, I feel that this option can help those who don't like sushi (or never tried it) a chance to try it again. The sushi itself is very good, but it's a little on the pricey side. This is an excellent place to take someone who's unsure about sushi, but if you're looking for a lot of sushi at a reasonable price you can find the same quality of sushi somewhere else at a cheaper price.",

I vetoed, but then no one ever listen to me :p So to The Cowfish we went.   Instead of being disappointed by their food again, I went for the $5 martini special as my entree.  The chocolate dipped fortune cookie martini was GRRREAT!  It was recommended as one of the stronger ones, and I was pleasantly impressed.  The presentation was cute, with a fortune cookie on the rim.  And 10oz was a good portion. I tasted a bite or two of the Arnold Hamandegger burger, and a few pieces of miscellenous sushi.  I have to say, their burgers are better than the sushi.   We're now back to 3 stars... a-ok, all because of the martini and the burger.",

It's a little tricky to keep from falling apart but otherwise perfection.  The interiors are full of what I would liken to Warhal (sp) type artwork and really cool in my opinion.  Another cool thing is the huge fish tank that actually contains 'cowfish', really neat!  So why not 5 star? I'm a pretty simple person in general and if I had one suggestion to give it would be lessen the choices to choose from on the menu.  Too much to look at and really overwhelming to me.",

But let me say this: Good luck to all of the restaurants out there living up to the awesomeness that is Cowfish. Yes, it really deserves five stars and my \"Woohoo!\"  The decor of Cowfish (including an image of a fat Elvis in a kimono eating a burger) is trendy, cool, and fun, just like the items on its menu. Both the food and drink options are fairly extensive, plus there are daily specials . I opted for the turkey burger, but let it be known that it wasn't the run-of-the-mill kind. This burger, presented on a whole wheat bun, was topped with brie, cranberries, and applies. Fancy shmancy and healthy!  Oh, and before you leave, make sure to take a tour of the boys or girls room. If your meal failed to do so, at least the audio from the restroom speakers might make you smile.",

The restaurant is spacious with some interesting artwork and paintings. My personal favorite was a painting of a Chinese Buddha with a Elvis face on it.  The restaurant is famous for both their burgers and sushi, especially the fusion of the two, and the name is? wait for it....\"Bergushi\"!   Coming from an Asian background, never would I have thought sushi and burgers would go well together, so I had to give it a try!!!  I ordered their popular Bergushi-- \"Taste Explosion\"! The plate had sushi rolls evenly spread out, topped with different sauces with a hint of pesto on top. The rolls looked like as if their were fried, but it's actually the tempura crust (which is deep-fried).   First of all, the dish looked amazing, and as I put it in my mouth, the taste LITERALLY EXPLODED in my mouth. The burger meat with different veggies and a layer of bacon wrapped around by the tempura sushi rice, The beef, sushi rice, celery, carrots, onion, bacon, pesto, slice of tomato...etc, all come together and bust in your mouth!! I'd say the name of the dish is incredibly fitting.  Overall it was a very, very enjoyable experience, I definitely had a \"foodgasm.\" Can't wait to go back again!!",

The food is good, the menu has something for everyone, the portions are large (for those who like that) and the flavors are generally very good.  We've been hooked on the bento boxes and tend to get those as we can't make up our minds for a single item.  The bento boxes include a slider, sushi, Asian cucumber salad, edamame and sweet potato or regular fries.  My only criticism is that the sushi chefs sometimes lack the necessary fish cutting skills and cut the fish too thickly (sorry, but in the case of sushi, bigger is not better).  But Cowfish is a solid choice with consistent quality.   The large rear patio is also a great dining option.",

This time, fire alarm went off for 5 minutes, under cooked sliders, over cooked eggs, over cooked chicken, a burger half well done the other have medium rare and cold food. But at least it only took an hour to get it.   A shame menu sounds good and when they execute, it can be good",

Long wait, crowded bar...for me I can find a better bar, better burger and better sushi too. But not  all in the same place, so if you need sushi and burgers at the same time,  this is the only place I know of in Clt. I like this place in spite of the yuppie crowds that frequent it. Service can be slow but food is prepared well. I would go back.",

    "text": "Their menu is overwhelming...in a fantastic sort of way. Having lived in Los Angeles for some years now, I wasn't quite looking forward to trying out a sushi/asian fusion joint in Charlotte. My parents insisted it was good so my husband and I gave it a go. I have to say that the fish tasted fresh and all our cut rolls were very flavorful and densely packed with fish and other misc ingredients. I recommend the tuna martini and any of their special rolls. My husband got the sushi burger which was probably about 3/5 stars - tasty but nothing out of the ordinary as you would expect from the description. The bento boxes are a great way to try different items if you like variety, and the quality is up there. I especially liked the thai cucumber salad - I even ordered two.   Give this place a try. It's one of the best asian fusion restaurants in Charlotte so far. The only drawback is the long wait time...at least 30 mins even on a Sunday night at 8pm.",

    "text": "Moo-(don't know what sound a fish makes so I am making a kissy face for sound effects, or water splashing?).  I have been going to Cowfish for over 2 years. It is the perfect spot for taking your visitors when they don't know exactly what they want. It's even better for the \"weirdos\" (no offense) who don't like sushi but could go for a burger. It has the best of both worlds and even options for veggie heads.  This time was a tad different because we were given a pet fish to watch \"grow\" as we waited. The premise was that when the fish got big enough it was then \"caught\" and our table was ready (a pic of our fish was uploaded, Mackerel Jordan). For those of us that are easily amused, it was very entertaining.   As promised, after a 20 minute wait (be prepared to wait AT LEAST an hour if you come on a Friday/Saturday evening) we were sat on the back patio. Despite the fact that it was quite warm outside, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal:   Appetizer: crab rangoon dip (it's like a crab wonton undone its warm gooey-ness is absolutely delicious)  Burger: Porky's Revenge (Half-pound beef burger, pulled pork, smoked gouda cheese, onion strings, bacon coleslaw, BBQ sauce, lettuce, pickles, brioche bun) OMG da BOMB for pulled pork lovers like me!  Bento: The Ultimate Brento Box (A combo meal featuring both burger and sushi, including a double-stack version of the featured mini-burger of the week, sweet potato fries, Thai cucumbers, edamame and the guest's choice of a 4 piece premium Fusion Specialty roll [Firecracker, The Boss or Blackened Tuna Roll]) It is perfect (not the perfect size for everyone as it is a small portion) for that person who wants the best of both worlds!  Sushi: Bagel Roll (Smoked salmon, kani, cream cheese roll battered and flash fried, topped with sweet eel sauce) Honestly, cream cheese on ANY roll is amazing, you won't regret it!  No I didn't eat ALL of this by myself, I shared a \"bite\" with everyone! And no I didn't drink THIS time but, last plug I promise, the Cheeky Monkey Martini was great! Seriously, no one regrets Cowfish (well your wallet might hence the four stars, check out prices before you come)!  Thank me later,  You're welcome!",

    "text": "I decided to go here with a friend after hearing rave reviews from everyone I know who has visited.  We went here on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't very crowded, as I have heard it can get on the weekends. We sat outside, and immediately were greeted by our waitress and she took the time to thoroughly explain the menu (and that the rolls are entree sized)  after we told her we were first time visitors.  We got the edamame and crab rangoon dip as appetizers, and they were amazing!  They were brought out relatively quick, and did not disappoint.  As far as entrees, we got mark's Roll, the volcanic rolls, and a few others.  They were rather large as the waitress has told us (I even ended up taking some home... and I NEVER have leftover sushi lol).  They tasted really good, but the volcanic and mark's roll were my favorites out of what we had.    All in all, it was an excellent experience!! Another thing that contributed to my rating was the attitude of the staff.  They were all very helpful, and available (which is a big deal with me).  Even the manager Kevin came over, and it wasnt the normal \"how was your meal?\" And then off to the next table.  He actually took the time to ask us about details of our experience,  made some recommendations for our next visit, thanked us for trying it for the first time, asked about our service, and really seemed to care about every aspect of our dining experience.  It really takes a lot to impress me with service, and this really stuck out to me.  So i am glad that I tried it, and will definitely recommend to anyone visitng Charlotte!!",

I'd recommend any of the meat sushi. I've had both Doug's filet and the bacon double cheeseburger sushi and they were both very good. Their regular sushi is good as well but not anything I would rave about. Milkshakes were also really good but big so I'd recommend splitting one.",

We offered their top selling appetizer, the crab dip, and there was very little crab and a lot of mayo and/or sour cream.  Service was great, atmosphere is like a chainy sports bar.

We had a large party so everyone was accommodated. And we had 4 small kids- what a task.  Atmosphere: I could see this as a date night, place to meet singles, family restaurant or possible solo mission. Really nice bar selection and tv's.

On the other hand, I hate paying the upscale price for food when I don't have to.  This is one of those upscale places where the food costs more than I prefer but apparently I paid for the quality I received.  The sushi roll I had was pretty good and filling.  I can't remember what I ordered but I know it was near that bottom of the menu and with tax, it cost me $18.40 or so.  I can say the roll was so big, it was easier to mix my wasabi and soy sauce in the dish and pour it on my roll than to dip my roll in the wasabi and soy sauce mixture.  I figured I'd need to stop elsewhere afterwards to get some more food because of the price but once the roll was consumed, I was satisfied and full.  This is one of those trendy food joints I'd visit on rare occasions.  If the rare occasion arose and this was an option, I would visit without hesitation.",

I think I'm still partial to the Deliverance, though... lol The sweet potato fries were super duper hot which was fantastic... The vegetables and edamame were just as delicious as I remembered... The burger was pretty good as well... I have learned, however, that I do not like cream cheese on my burgers... lol  The boyfriend came with and was incredibly impressed with his Pittsburgoo-shi sandwich... Filet mignon with pastrami, fries, multiple cheeses and red onions with a Dijon sauce...  The bun?  It's made out of sushi wraps filled with rice... Crazy... I guess it was frickin awesome because he didn't offer me any... lol    The service was great... I think the server's name this time was Steven...

For my slider, they were happy to sub a turkey burger instead of the beef.  The burger of the day was some sort of concoction with jalapeno pepper. IT was perfectly seasoned and grilled. Yummo!     Also included in my bento box was a serving of sweet potato fries which were perfectly seasoned & cooked.  The other compartments included Edamame, cucumber salad, and 3 pieces of Nigri sushi. The Nigri included Tuna, salmon, and shrimp with a small portion of pickled ginger and wasabi.   All of this deliciousness can be had for $14... well worth it in my opinion!    On the day of my visit, I was there just after the lunch hour rush, and because I was alone, I chose to just sit at the bar. The bartender was very helpful and attentive.   I really wish there were a Cowfish closer to my home & work in Ballantyne!",

We arrived around 4pm on a Saturday and were seated right away since the patio had quite a few open tables. We order the Crab Rangoon as an appetizer since a lot of fellow Yelpers suggested it and boy was it amazing!!! We had that along with some cocktails and it was truly an enjoyable dinner. I ordered a bento box and my husband ordered the yellowfin tuna. We were both pleased with our selection and left as happy campers. Will definitely return here when I'm in Charlotte again.",

Shame of them! ANYWAY, i yelped \"sashimi\" and since i was already in South Park Mall this restaurant came up. Of course i do my visual reading of image after image and decided, yup, this is it.   Upon arrival it was before the dinner rush i wasn't quickly acknowledged but maybe they thought i was waiting for someone. No, I was there solo. I have no friend out in charlotte but i do have class so yay me and my \"just me\" seating arrangement.   After being seated my waiter took care of me throughout my entire dining visit. I ordered just the 9 piece sashimi and man, it made up for the mess that Mai Restaurant dealt me. Presentation itself would be good enough for a few stars but since they had fresh sashimi and good service, 5 stars it is! I'd definitely hit this place up again.",

Flavors were so oddly complementary. I should note I make smoothies regularly with bananas and peanut butter, if you don't really love them try a different one ;p  Aside from great food the atmosphere was excellent, the beer selection was great (I had Wooden Robot's Chocolate Stout) and my waitress was very attentive and actually hung out quite a bit and shot the shit as I was there late and by myself.   I'd definitely recommend it to any burger connoisseurs who want some odd but excellent combinations.",

The bento boxes include one artisan mini burger, choice of sushi, and several sides of choice (my favorites are the sweet potato fries and edamame).  My little kids love the food and atmosphere too.

The wine came out lukewarm, and when we asked the server if she could bring out a colder bottle her response was that \"They get feedback all the time that the wine is not cold and that was the best she could do.\" Later on we saw a table visiting with someone who had a birthday. It was my friend's birthday dinner, so we told the server while my friend went to the restroom. The server simply said \"Oh, that's nice.\" And didn't do anything special for my friend. She couldn't have forgotten we told her since we asked to cover the bottle of wine as something for our friend's birthday. Overall, we felt like the server was very impatient, had a negative attitude, and was not willing to do anything extra. Again, delicious food, but room for improvement when it comes to the wait staff.",

Our server Steven was an awesome help and tipped me off to some great things on the menu, along with being super friendly.

I ordered the Fusion Specialty Bento Box. It included a roll of my choice (Mark's) and the slider of the week. Food didn't take terribly long to arrive despite being so packed. The slider was average. I enjoyed the gorgonzola spread it came with but there was hardly enough on there to truly comment on it. The patty itself was decent, but not spectacular. The sushi roll was good. I really like inside-out rolls. The wasabi mayo added a good level of heat but I could have used with more fish. The sides were also mediocre. Sweet potato fries -- while tasty, not very creative. My friend got one of the hybrid rolls with beef inside and cheese on top, coming as a recommendation from the waitress. I guess being used to the coolness of raw fish the warm sushi was a strange sensation. They use chopped beef which kind of falls apart in your mouth and the thick fry breading makes it difficult to eat more than one or two.   Overall, I thought service was helpful and patient with us. We were a pretty indecisive bunch. However, I found the restaurant misty kitschy and probably not somewhere I would frequent. It's definitely a place to visit once but the food is not that interesting in execution.",

Don't forget to ask for 10 pieces instead of 8. Last time i nearly choked and seriously burgushied all over the table when i started laughing right after shoving the huge roll in my mouth.  The appetizers we've had have all been good. My favorite was the potstickers which i don't see on their online menu at the moment? The crab rangoon dip was also good and the Sweets, Sticks and Strings seem like a steal for $5 to split.   Sidenote: We also really liked the wanton soup that was not available today unfortunately.   We got there just before the lunch crowd and enjoyed the closed in/covered patio with heaters. They definitely have a great outdoor space come spring. We'll definitely keep coming back and if you're visiting us from out of town, start studying the menu because we'll be taking you there before you leave.",

As a single diner I loved it because of the touchscreens at the sushi bar that allowed me to read the NYT while I ate. But the menu was overwhelming a la cheesecake factory style. I think the idea is amazing, but they should scale the menu down and focus on improving their food (which was good, but not great).",

I would give this place zero stars if I could!!!",

This gave us a chance to get a few drinks at the bar, they had a good beer selection.    We were sat after a short wait and really enjoyed the calamari appetizer.  For an entree I ordered the the whats shakin' tuna bacon sandwich.  That was a DELISH! The bun was filled with Kani and Rice.  Made for a great sandwich sushi combo.    I had also tried the suchi roll my brother ordered and that was also delish.    I never tried the burgers but next time I stop I will probably give them a try.  My 3 year old daughter really enjoyed the chicken tenders as well.  Which says a lot considering she is the pickiest eater.",

I had great service both times-- the waitresses were very sweet and accomodating. I really enjoyed the Spider roll, but not a big fan of the Burgushi (burger and sushi combined-the flavor was quite strange). The second time I went, a homeless dude walked into the restaurant and blatantly stole a bottle of wine and a 6 pack of beer from the bar...and there were customers and employees right there! Some waiters stopped him as he was trying to escape...it was so bizarre... Nevetheless, I would definitely be coming in again for their great food!",

We had Chris as our server and after mentioning it was our first time here, he took the time to explain everything on the menu and recommended some of his favorites. It was starting to get pretty busy in the restaurant and we really appreciated Chris taking his time to explain the menu to us. We never felt rushed. After placing our order our toddler's food was brought out pretty quickly (thank goodness for that because kids don't like to wait). My husbands and my food was brought out within 10-15min. We both ordered a bento box and it was fantastic! The cucumber salad is to die for. Also, we ordered a PB&J sandwich for my daughter and they rolled it up to look like a piece of sushi-super creative and she was excited to eat it. Before we left the manager, Christie, came to our table to introduce herself and ask how our meal was. She said she heard it was our first time and gave us a coupon for our next visit. Although the restaurant was super busy at the time, Christie took her time to speak with us and ask us about our visit. You can really tell Christie and Chris are passionate about people and where they work and we will most certainly be back again soon. Hopefully to have Chris again as our server! A fantastic experience all around. And super clean bathrooms! Thanks Cowfish! See you again soon!",

    "text": "Ventured into Cowfish for dinner on Tuesday and had a great experience.  It was bustling, especially for a Tues night, so we had to wait 15 min for a table.  It was a good time to do some people watching and peruse the environment.  The decor is polished and hip - could fall on either side of the casual / fine dining line.  There is a huge fish tank, good lighting, and interesting - sometimes comic - art on the walls.  The crowd was young, lots of 20 somethings versus the business dinner crowd.  As for the food...  There is a huge menu and it is slightly overwhelming.  Their sushi rolls are giant, eclectic, and are pretty good.  I shared some sushi with my dining mates and then opted for the bento box - which basically allows you to sample the highlights of their menu.  It included a little burger (tasty), sweet potato fries (very good), sushi (delicious), a spicy cucumber salad (rockin), and some edamame.  Great meal!  Plan on spending approximately $25 per person with food and a modest beer.  Not too bad for good atmosphere and fun food.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful in navigating us through the menu.  There was an error in one of our sides and a little delay in it coming out - though no complaints from us - so the manager stopped by to apologize and comped the bill.  Outstanding customer service!",

They have one of the longest greetings due to the lengthy menu and make sure you know what they're all about. I personally would not be able to do the speech they have without stopping for a water break!   We came in last night tried to call ahead and get a reservation but they had stopped taking them at the time and said they were not on a wait at that time and to head on in. So we had planned that if it was crazy busy and a long wait we would just go somewhere else in the area. Lucky for us we got right in and sat on the patio!   Kevin had recommended the Ahi tuna Nachos to start so we did....they were kinda whatever, bland, Tuna was not very good and they stuck plain (not dressed) micro-greens on top a huge pet-peeve of mine! We then ordered the rest of our meal I started with the spinach salad with a warm bacon vinaigrette it was ok. They then shortly (1min later) followed it up with our entrees :(  I had the Shroom Burger with grilled onions on a brioche roll...was ok. the Shrooms had a very strange taste to them just different. I did however trust Kevin again and ordered them with the Sweet Potato fries and they were excellent just as Kevin said they'd be!! I tried my sisters (Tracy D.) Sushi Roll Mango something that was good. My BF had the Bento Box, again just ok.  So I would say we had an OK meal nothing special and nothing that really makes me want to go back either. Kevin said they are the hottest restaurant in Charlotte right now...but are they??",

    "text": "Three words of advice if dining here on a weekend night: make a reservation. Because my group did not, our wait was 1:45 as relayed by the hostess. We hoped she was bluffing.  Nevertheless, my first impression of this burger-meets-sushi-and-more place was positive. Service was prompt and attentive despite her responsibility for several other large tables, and the atmosphere is lively and casual-hip, if not a little loud (but again, it was a weekend night).  We loved the blackened ahi tuna nacho appetizer, and my entree--eight Miss Moffitt's rolls--was enough to have me leaving full and happy. More words of advice with regard to the latter: not for the dainty eater. These are gargantuan rolls, and unless you go fork-and-knife you're going to have to be comfortable with no-shame facial contortion and chubby cheeks.  One of my dining companions loved his C.B.C.L.T. burger, and I was eyeing the Green Monster before opting for sushi--perhaps worth a try another time when I'm in the mood for a patty.  Oh, and the menu is a novelette, so you'll probably need a little time with it as a newbie diner.  The wine menu was average, though the specialty drink and dessert menus had some interesting selections--so maybe next time (when I'll be sure to make a reservation).",

There is nothing out there in the Southeast that I know of that is coming even close to this place.  Being from Atlanta where the burger craze is in full swing, this place puts some of our burger spots to shame.  Did I mention the sushi is bad-ass?  I mean, even if you know of a place in Charlotte to get better sushi, or burgers, or milkshakes, or Burgushi (doesn't exist anywhere else, seriously), or tea, or cocktails, or good wine, you can't get them all under one roof like this place does!  Was only in Charlotte for a couple of days, and I had to come twice just because I would have felt bad if I came here any less..  The menu is huge!  It would take you at least a couple of years dining  casually at this place to even try half of the menu.  Burgers I had were great and cooked perfectly.  Sushi rolls, although expensive, were awesome.  Burgushi, was strange but good and I would try it again.  Milkshake was tasty.  Didn't have a chance to try the \"adult\" milkshakes that contained booze, but I'll have one next time.  Seaweed salad was one of the best I've ever had.  These guys are booked pretty solid for dinner, best bet is the bar if you can't get a table.  Less crowded for lunch, but not by much.    In a great part of town that had a great little community.  Man, I didn't realize that Charlotte was such a foodie town, I'll be back for sure.",

VERY busy at 12:15 on a Saturday, but we wanted sushi, and were immediately seated at the sushi bar--rather than wait the 30 minutes for a table. My ONLY complaint was the level of noise in the restaurant, amplified by no ceiling. But that was the only negative. The selection is large on the sushi & sushimi menu, and the wait staff were ALL most friendly and very attentive, without being in the way. My wife had a Queen City roll, which was so good she neglected to let me try it...no matter, as my King's roll was huge, incredibly fresh, and produced a mouthgasm for me. My O'Douhl's non-alcoholic Amber was ice cold an served in a frosted glass...the perfect accoutrement for the very spicy--but certainly not hot, by any stretch--Kings Roll. We split the lobster & crab spring roll for an appetizer, nearly too artistically presented to eat;  but we somehow managed and these 4 spring rolls DID NOT disappoint in the least. Funky and cheery atmosphere, just too noisy for our 61 year old ears. However, way above excellent foot and service...absolutely worth finding around the Crate & Barrel. Go, please go!",

First they didn't take reservations, then they did take some reservations if you called in, then they had a few tables in OpenTable, back to no reservations, now to this stupid fish tank thing that doesn't tell you where you are on the list and is no where near accurate on their app, based on their description.  The food is fine, but that's it, it's just fine.  It certainly doesn't merit an hour and a half wait.  I would equate them to a TGI Friday's in terms of quality of cuisine and atmosphere.  If you want real Japanese cuisine, try Sushi Guru, Yama or Baku across the street.  10 times better and not this trendy, whitewashed BS they're serving.",

We were seated out in the patio, I like how they have heaters out there SINCE it was COOLD that night. Our server was very informative, and nice. He answered all our questions and even made a few reconditions(-: I ordered the Salmon Salad, my mom ordered the Dino OMG roll. Best salmon salad ever! I loved the vinaigrette that came with it and how my salad wasn't completely drench, and the cream cheese balls that came with it gave it a nice touch! (Salmon however was a TAD dry but that's okay!) I also tried one of my mom's roll and it was gooooood. Overall great food=great experience! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu items!!",

Being from Hawaii, it's nice to find some good fish all the way in the Queen City. I have brought people here for their birthdays, lunch dates, and the occasional drop in for my craving for sushi.  I've never had something here that I haven't liked in the past five years till yesterday. Don't get me wrong it would have been good for someone else, just it was a little to much fusion for my taste . It was some of their newer rolls they had up won't say the names cause I don't wonna bash the place I love.  Next time I'm sticking to my usual the bomb ass tropical storm rolls, and spider rolls oh and that new roll they have the ... lobster boss  roll I think or the angry lobster was so freaking good they obviously did something right   FYI if you if it's your birthday there you'll love the gong.",

    "text": "I went to Cowfish for the very first time a few weeks ago after hearing about it and I have to say I was really impressed. I should have reviewed before now but at Christmas Time, things are busy and free time is slim. I came on a Wednesday night and I didn't know it was 1/2 price bottle of wine night, that made the wait for 2 people go up to 35 minutes. after reading other reviews it seems to be the norm around here. however, you do get a text sent to your phone incase you were to go sit in your car away from where the pager can reach you.  Super Clean Restaurant, One of the cleanest I've been too.    The menu is expansive and everyone you bring will be able to find something they enjoy.  I was told by a friend that I needed to try the Crab Rangoon dip. HOLY COW GUYS. NOTHING Compares. It is AWESOME. The chips have the red sauce on it that you normally dip Crab Rangoons. I will order this Every Time!  I didn't try the Burgushi, I got regular sushi, and it was on par with some of the best I've had.   My 3 Cons are 1) I had to wait as long as I did with Clean tables in sight. NO RESERVATIONS 2) It's pretty loud, louder than I expect a sit down Restaurant to be. might have been the half price wine ;-) 3) It's Rather expensive, the Waitress said normally a person would get 2 rolls to fill them up. 2 Sushi rolls (Marks Roll and Soft Shell Crab Roll ) Cost me around 32 dollars. Great sushi, Less than Great Price.   All in All, Good Place with Great food, but I'll only be there when someone else wants to go.",

Although we waited close to an hour to be seated--mostly due to poor planning on my part and failure to call ahead--the overall ambiance, friendly staff and delicious food and drink made up for it. If you're not very adventurous or a huge raw fish fan like myself, then I would highly recommend getting the North Hills Roll, which was so fresh and flavorful. Who knew that mango on top of coconut shrimp tempura rolls could be sooo good?! I was really impressed though several days later when I realized I'd accidentally been double charged for two dinners and called their customer service line, where I was promptly assisted and even sent a very generous gift card in the mail for my troubles. Although a minor inconvenience at the time, I was very impressed with their proficiency and speed to correct the server's error, while also retaining my business for future visits. I will definitely go back as a result!",

    "text": "I've been putting off writing this review because I can't decide if I like Cowfish or not.  After having almost a week to let my thoughts process, I would have to say that although the product is fresh, I wouldn't consider Cowfish a True sushi spot but an Americanized version.  I also think overall Cowfish is lost in its trendiness.  The first time we attempted to go was on a Saturday night and showed up to an hour and a half wait.  Cowfish doesn't take reservations so we decided not to wait it out.  We later showed up on a Weds night and there was still an hour wait.  We eventually managed to grab 2 seats at the bar and just made it a night there.  The items we ordered were Blackened tuna nachos, Southpark roll, and the King's Roll.  I have to say I really liked the tuna nachos, but they aren't sushi.  The King's Roll was the better of the two rolls.  I asked if they had miso soup, and sadly, they did not.  The wasabi was also the squeeze kind that is never hot enough.  The part I didn't like was it felt much more of a bar scene than a restaurant.  When I went to Nikko, I didn't downgrade them for the club atmosphere, because it really didn't interfere with the meal.  Definitely not the case here.  People were everywhere, especially hanging over me while I ate.    Overall, I think the food was fresh, if not what I would think of as sushi, but the scene will make me think twice before returning.",

Great restaurant to hangout with friends and grab delicious sushi burger combos with local beers. I always reserve 10% of my choices for a pescatarian choice now and then, and this is one of my favorites. Being new in town and while exploring Charlotte's sushi options I came across with Cowfish Sushi Burger, went in more to just explore as I'm always  skeptical when \"land and sea\" meet, as one or the other always tend to not be good. However, Cowfish surprisingly carries great lean, grass fed local beef burgers and awesome large fresh sushi creation. Best is they accommodate your choice to vegan and or gluten free. Super great customer service, staff is ALWAYS friendly, excited and seemed to love working here. The latter makes a big difference for me as who want bad vibes in their foods. Their fried calamari n octopus, is a must appetizer! And if you are visiting for the first time I recommend going for a combo box as you can pretty much taste and have a bit of all and customize  conveniently and to any dietary restrictions. My family and I now LOVE this place and it's one of our first choices in Charlotte. I highly recommend CowFish and make sure you step into their restroom, super creative sayings through speakers and pictures.",

We tried that as an appetizer, and then I ordered a bento box (spicy tuna roll, edamame, sweet potato fries, plus a burger). I would come back. Service was excellent; management continued to check with us to ensure we had a good experience. (Though once or twice is good enough, no need to check with us 4 times!).",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW!!! This place blew me away! My family and I visited Cowfish on a Sunday night before attending a local concert. Although we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, we were able to enjoy the restaurant's positive atmosphere and unique artwork from the bar until we were seated. One of the waiters even noticed us admiring the art and was nice enough to give us a few postcards of some of the paintings. That, my friends, is a prime example of quality service!!  For dinner, my brother built his own burger, my mom got the Dion's OMG! Roll, my dad ordered the Screamin Korean Chicken Sandwich, and I ordered Mrs. Woodbury's Fresh Find sushi roll. First of all, let me say that I have never seen my family so quiet during dinner. And this wasn't a bad thing!! The food was literally so good no one wanted to stop eating in order to speak! My sushi roll was so fresh: the salmon was buttery, the side of fresh tuna poke was delectable, and the avocado was incredibly creamy!! It is by far one of the best FRESH rolls I've had. Almost any sushi roll that has tempura or cooked fish in it can be good, but it is hard to find a completely raw roll that stands out, and this one sure did! I also had a piece of the Dion's OMG! Roll and literally...OMG!!! The name describes it way too well. The coconut shrimp gives that roll such a unique flavor! It's safe to say that my taste buds and tummy were extremely happy!! I'm not even embarrassed to admit that I am planning another trip out to Charlotte just so I can eat here again. IT WAS THAT GOOD! Don't miss the opportunity to try Cowfish!! Great atmosphere, unique menu, friendly staff, delicious food, and creative artwork= 5/5 stars!!!",

I was really craving sushi so my husband and I didn't do the burgers and stuck to two of the large fusion rolls, a seaweed salad \"martini\" and three pieces of nigiri. Both rolls were great, definitely pricey but worth the cost. Really interesting combination of flavor and texture in both and nice presentation. Friendly service, fairly quick but it was also a bit empty. Some very fishy smells in the back near the bathrooms (like spoiled fish not sushi) were the only things making this less than perfect. But I'd definitely go again!",

    "text": "Oh the legendary cowfish. I have been dining at this restaurant at least once a year since it opened, and every year it seems to change just slightly. When I say change, I mean that people from the queen city more and more come to realize that this place is as close to a foodie fusion place as it'd ever get in Charlotte.  The very first time I came here was back in 2009, that was when they used a school bus to deliver orders. I thought it was a super cool concept, I had even read about it in the local magazine. At times I would show up at this restaurant and the manager would have daily huddles with his team of servers right before the restaurant open. I'd say great business mindset. Service is everything and they seem to have had it right. The interior decor is very matching of the name, everything had some kind of cow and some kind of fish resemblance. Aferall cow fish means a burger and sushi place! The bar is a nice area with a cool blue back drop. The presentation of the food was nice, their burgers are stellar. Price is around the $10-$20 range for an average dish.  The last time I was at this restaurant, It was late December 2014, by then it seems it had became the \"IT\" place of Charlotte. The wait was now around 1-1.5 hr just for dinner on a weekend. They ask for your number and you can track the status of your wait on a cute website with a fish. That time we never made it in to the restaurant, we ended up eating at upstream instead, however, if the wait wasn't so long, we would have definitely preferred dining at cowfish.",

I love the idea of my two favorite foods being served in one restaurant and fused together. Burgers & Sushi. Yes!! Why is this the only place doing this??   My most recent trip, I got the 4-s. It's a sushi burger. It has rice buns with sashimi inside and some sprouts. We also got two other rolls, one had coconut shrimp inside and mango on top and the other had fried oysters inside. Both were fantastical.   Already dreaming of my next visit.",

Fish?\" assuming I had misheard.  This unique restaurant flawlessly blends land and sea in an innovative way.   The wait time here can be completely ridiculous, with wait times constantly above an hour on weekend nights, but if you go early (before 6sih) during the week you should be fine. The crab spring rolls are delicious and come with a great sweet and sour sauce to dip it in. If you are a sushi fan I would recommend the The Boss or Miss Moffit's Roll (obviously I am a tuna lover). If you are feeling mildly, but not completely, adventurous the bento boxes are a great compromise, where you can try the burger of the week, sweet potato fries, sushi, edamame and the thai cucumber salad. I don't care for the cucumber salad and they will double up on edamame instead if requested. If you are all in for the fusion experience, I liked the Taste Explosion Roll or the Turfin' Surfer Roll. Both those rolls were rather large and I ended up cheating and using a fork and knife.  The menu can be a little intimidating the first time you go, so I would recommend reviewing online beforehand.",

The Wontons had a sweet thai chili sauce on them that put a touch on the appetizer that made it something really special. I ordered the Deliverance Roll. It was a barbeque sushi roll topped with a bacon slaw and a heaping pile of onion straws. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. It was so much food. I could only eat three pieces. My wife ordered the Fusion Specialty Bento Box. It came with the burger slider of the day which was a bacon cheeseburger with gouda cheese. The bento box came with sweet potato fries that were perfectly crunchy and salty. It also came with edamame that was cooked extremely well and salted to perfection. In the Specialty box you get to choose between four different sushi options. She went with the Firecracker option and it was delicious. It had a tiny kick of spicy to it but was not unbearable by any means. All in all, this place is one that will be getting a lot of our money in the near future.",

This place is amazing, great food, and unique pairings. Their veggie burger has a homemade patty, and their sides seem simple, but are made so unique you wont recognize them once you've ordered. I got onion rings, and they were fried in coconut batter and tempura, then dipped in horseradish. Asian inspired diner food: amazingly creative.   Great service, great food, great location.

I have been coming to this joint regularly for years, and will continue to do so.  The Raleigh and Charlotte locations are both great.  I don't hand out 5 stars on Yelp often, but this place gets 5 every time.  One of only two downsides is the price...with a bottle of wine, I have never walked away from dinner for two for less than $100.  However, half priced bottles of wine every Wednesday is a must.  The other downside is there is usually a wait, but it's always worth it and you can get drinks from the bar while you wait for your table.",

We started off with the Seared Tuna Nachos, very tasty and love the idea of each nacho chip being carefully stacked with the ingredients mentioned on the menu.  All 5 chips are fresh and topped with goodness.  My girlfriend and I split our main meals; I had The Green Monster, sounded great on the menu but there was no flavor to the meat, no salt, pepper, garlic salt, nothing.  The ingredients the flavorless burger had stacked on it didn't offer anything either, I could only taste the jalapenos.  My girlfriend's choice was the Taste Explosion from their Burgushi section, lots of flavor, however very heavy and wouldn't choose it again if I was the only one eating it.  Although heavy, the Taste Explosion is definitely a menu option I would get again to share.  Minus the burger, good spot to check out, there's something on the menu for all.",

    "text": "The sushi was fresh, but the selection was limited as is to be expected I suppose if you're not on the coast (especially the west coast where the sushi is unmatched). Anyway....the sushi was delicious and they had white tuna which was very tasty. I definitely feel that this is one of the best sushi places in Charlotte. When we ate there it was a very busy night so we sat at the sushi bar. Fun with touch screen games and menu ordering options, definitely something different. The server was certainly a bright spot of the experience. She was so friendly and outgoing and was on the ball with service and any help we needed. One shortcoming was she was very unfamiliar with the menu and any seasonal and fresh fish they currently had in stock. This is probably not her fault as the restaurant is new and apparently very busy, I think she may not have received the proper training. No worries though, because her wonderful personality more than made up for it, and she made a great recommendation for a roll. It was the Rising Sun roll and was scallops on the inside and yellow fin tuna on the outside topped with masago and tobigo......Delicious! I highly recommend this place for an excellent sushi experience.",

Server had major attitude which wasn't fun (she obviously could not be bothered to do her job) but the food was good.  The onion strings were AMAZING!  Cooked exactly right.  The hamburger brioche bun was toasted perfectly although the meat was somewhat overdone and could have had more flavor than it did.  I liked the choices of toppings which was nice.  The kalamata olives were pitted.  I think that some slaw or a pickle could have been added to the plate.  Again, the server just did not want to be there and made it very apparent.  I would recommend eating here for a lunch though.  Being from Seattle it is difficult for me to eat fish in a land-locked city though so I'll be sticking with the sandwiches and burgers.  I had signed up for email as others have mentioned but have not received any coupons whatsoever nor was I offered anything during this experience.",

In terms of ambiance, waitstaff, etc, this place is five stars. Based on what we had for dinner...two stars is gracious. We had the most helpful server and followed recommendations---crab Rangoon dip and the taste explosion burgushi.  We also ordered a firecracker roll. The crab Rangoon dip is ok, but the portion is huge and almost offensive..it would carry its novelty better if it were paired down. It's rich, it's gooey, it's overkill. The bergushi....what can I say...it's like eating a burger in a sushi roll. Sticky rice, melted cheese, hamburger. Ick! It's novel, but Its just wrong. The firecracker roll was the best thing we ate...the presentation was gorgeous  our waiter did us a big favor and had the roll cut in 10 pieces rather than 8 . Loved that tip. Perhaps we ordered wrong, we wanted to like this place...its new, its a fun concept, but the food was less than desirable.",

    "text": "After hearing multiple raves from reliable sources about The Cowfish Sushi l Burger Bar, it was tops on the list to review. Having been twice, and both times with small kids, I've been impressed with different aspects of the SouthPark eatery. But seriously, the best part? Both visits have included Ric Flair spottings. WOO! NATURE BOY!  When I first heard of Cowfish, I was expecting more of a Sushi Samba vibe, but I was happily surprised by friendly rather than pretentious servers, water served on tables in glass milk bottles, and a tongue-in-cheek mood provided by the piped in Japanese-to-English translations of American colloquialisms in the restrooms, and the more obvious comic bookish canvases of fast food icons discussing burgers hanging beside Warholesque representations of sushi. There's a sense of humor here, and it is served up with a side of contemporary, innovative fun.  The place is bigger than it looks at first glance, and the menu is a tad overwhelming. On the first visit, I errantly chose the The Tuscan Turkey Burger. It was average, though the server mentioned it would be a little drier than a regular burger, which should have tipped me off to choose another option. On the second visit, I chose The Cowfish Bento Box with a slider and veggie sushi, and I realized why so many friends swear by Cowfish. There was more than enough food, and loads of different flavors that easily satisfied. Sushi is as well-presented as it is delicious, and the kid's meals include a happy face on the rice detail.  During the first visit, the service was exceptional. During the second visit, the service was good, especially considering it was Father's Day lunch, when they were busier than usual. Outdoor seating feels oddly cozy, especially since it overlooks highly trafficked Sharon Road, and umbrellas and fans make warm weather pleasant.  So, will I return to The Cowfish Sushi and Burger Bar? Does The Nature Boy say \"WOO\"? I'll be taking my coupons I get by signing up on their website, and making a reservation, though. They are always busy, and the wait times, especially during prime dinner hours, are daunting.",

Also, the busier it gets the harder it is to hear whoever is sitting next/across from you being the place has no insulation for sound buffering. Food is good [not wonderful and there are much better sushi take-out options close by] and a bit pricy but that's what one expects when hanging out at a hot-spot in Charlotte. Try the bento boxes.",

I don't think it was expensive, rather in line with what you would get at any place that serves sushi.   Actually, HONESTLY, I walked out of there thinking I got one hell of a deal. The food was ROCKIN! The service was too.   We tried some of everything being as we are from out of town and the menu was just too incredible and outrageous to pick one thing to eat...   You definitely need reservations, and don't hesitate to look at other peoples food as you are walking in - The presentations were tip-top, as was ours when the food was served.   You don't like sushi? There is plenty of traditional choices that looked out of this world... Want to \"hang\" with the sushi crowd but not eat fish? Get some filet and portabella wrapped in a roll - you make the rules.    Bottom line - You'll leave impressed and craving more.",

    "text": "After reading raving reviews for this restaurant I was pretty adamant this was the place to stop by in Charlotte, and the entire ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and unique with parody movie posters of cow and fish making a name for the restaurant. So we were naturally excited to try out their dishes. We started with thr fried calamari and while the sauce has a swt and sour sauce tangyness the overall taste was very salty. It was so salty that while i was chewing on the calamari I also chewed bits of sea salt along with it. Moving on to the main entree we ordered the cowfish bento box which is a combination of sushi,  cucumber salad, swt potato fries, roll of your choice in my case california roll, edamame and a mini slider. While the selection varied it was again very salty. The california roll was mediocre, the edamame again salt chunks, swt potato fries a little soggy but okay and the cucumber salad I barely touched because I wasnt sure what it was suppose to taste like. However the mini slider <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> so I guess the winner here is the burger and surprisingly it wasnt salty or soggy but had just enough juicyness with savory and soft meat. I would stop by just for the ambiance and also because its kid friendly but would only order a burger instead of any sushi. The wait staff was very prompt and quick to accommodate the children overall its not a bad place but also not amazing.",

To have this listed with Charlotte restaurant royalty (McNinch, Good Food, Mimosa, etc) could not be more off.    I am guessing you can tell by now that I am not a fan.    To begin, the menu is comically big, whenever I see a menu that long, it automatically is an issue.   For the traditional sushi rolls - the cost/value is all off.  17 bucks for a sub-par tempura shrimp roll does not seem right.  Fusion rolls, I had the BBQ, and the bbq was not tasty and the roll seemed forced.    I guess  lot of people like this place, but for me, it is not any good.",

    "text": "Being a loyal fan of The Counter, I felt betrayed when it closed and this crazy fusion restaurant called Cowfish (what is a cowfish anyway?) took its place. Apparently, I am a weak-willed women because I eventually gave in to my curiosity a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try.   My boyfriend and I arrived around 9 o'clock and were shocked to see a flock hungry patrons sitting outside, beepers in hand, waiting for a table. We went inside to put our names down and were very impressed with the interior of the restaurant. I am not really one of those people who pics a restaurant based on the design or how 'cool' it is but this certainly worked in Cowfish's favor.   After our number came up and our beeper started flashing, we were taken to our table and greeted by one of the friendliest waitresses I have ever encountered. We told her we had never been there before and she proceeded to guide us through the very large menu, answering any questions we had as she went.   We proceeded to order the blackened ahi tuna nachos for our appetizer and we each chose the bento boxes for our entree. When the nachos arrived, I was in awe of how big they were. The 'nachos' are actually fried wontons and they are topped with their crab rangoon dip, pico de gallo, avocado, greens, and delicious ahi tuna. I took my first bite and literally fell in love. The tuna was fresh and all of the toppings tasted like they had been sliced and prepared to order. We scarfed them down in minutes and resisted the urge to place an order for more.   Our bento boxes arrived soon after finishing the appetizer. I was amazed to see a huge selection of food with very generous portions. The box contained their mini burger of the week, the bib, which was served on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese and chili. The burger was tasty and fulfilled my desire for the comforts of The Counter fare. We moved on to the sweet potato fries (crispy and well-salted), Thai cucumbers (really delicious), and edamame (pretty standard). We saved the sushi roll for last, I selected 'Mark's Roll' which was spicy with jalapeno and siracha and very well-made. My boyfriend had the rainbow roll which was not as good as my roll but still very good.   We had a great experience at Cowfish-- great food, great service, great atmosphere. I have been back since then and will continue to come back for fabulous food.",

Went out of my way. That alone speaks volumes. So let us rewind to December of 2012 when my boyfriend got a really fantastic job offer in Charlotte, NC that would force us to relocate from Massachusetts. After a lot of soul searching, I gave in to this venture and came to Charlotte the weekend before Christmas for a house-hunting trip. I was prepared to hate it. I anticipated hating it. Before we left, my boyfriend let me plan us our first date in Charlotte so I made us reservations at Cowfish. The menu was fantastic. Not only was our food delicious (and beautiful to look at) but it was reasonably priced and there was SO MUCH to choose from. You can't make a mistake but there are pages and pages of really exciting food options. Moreover the restaurant itself is really gorgeous and clean and such an appeasing atmosphere and their staff are all really nice and accommodating. Usually there is always one drawback to a cool restaurant with good food but they've really got it all going on. They really made Charlotte look good to me. I'm glad that was my first impression. Cowfish is now one of our more sentimental special occasion restaurants. We were back a few weeks ago to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Fried pickles and coconut batter onion rings?

    "text": "Delicious, charming, and chic.   This yelp review is based off the Yelpy Hour that Cowfish so graciously hosted. Lemme tell ya, you need to call ahead for seats, at least on a Thursday night. This place was PACKED. 35 minutes for a table. Good thing us Yelpers had a reserved section.   Plate after plate of different, yummy food was brought out, so I got to have the sushi, burger, and extras.   Sushi: To DIE for. They had such interesting fusion! Normally I like to go traditional, but I'm glad I got to try these new favorites. I can't really identify any of the roles that I ate for free besides the obvious salmon or tuna laying across the top, but they were all great. We actually decided to stay for dinner after, it was so good. We ended up getting the Tuna Nachos, and the Motherload.   Those tuna nachos... damn. They make my mouth water just thinking about them. Very large, flat nacho with rich, creamy crab rangoon dip spread over it, some greens and spices on top of that, and then tuna sashimi on top. So, so good. The only thing is that the seasoning on the Tuna (which almost tasted like ginger), while good on the tuna, seemed to clash with the rest of the crab rangoon/chip ensemble. That wasn't a problem for me, since I merely ate the sashimi first, then delved into the chip.  The Motherload is a $23 sushi platter that has all the fish on the menu. When we ordered it, the waiter assured me that this was not for sushi beginners, and we might see some stuff we hadn't previously discovered. I love your deeper, untraditional Americanan sushi, and was excited. However upon receiving the order, it was pretty much all normal stuff on there. Delicious yes, but normal. Delicious rolls with white fish, tuna, salmon, and fillet, topped with flying fish roe. The sashimi consisted of a few slices of octopus, a very large sweet shrim (my favorite), and sliced scallop (second favorite). The scallop was topped with salmon roe. There was also a tempura-fried prawn in a spring roll with peanut dipping sauce, which I am glad to say, also came with the head on the plate (gotta love sucking out those prawn brains! ... I may have scarred my dinner partner for life in doing so, though.). All in all delicious, but I think pretty standard sushi fare.  Burgers: I don't know what they were. Little sliders that were flavorful, covered in sauces and condiments, different veggies, and were very juicy. Delicious.   Extras: Fried pickles: they were there. They are what they are: good, but nothing to write home about. Chicken skewers: platter of very flavorful and moist marinated chicken. Not a huge chicken onna stick person if there's sushi around to be had, but these were great little noms.  Edamame: Lightly salted, gently steamed, and delicious  Drinks:  My vodka collins was always refilled, and though not extremely flavorful, very strong.  Got to try some 'carbonated' sake. Usually a stickler for traditional warmed plum, this was actually pretty good, very fruity. Glad I got to try it.  I'm sitting here, writing this review with my mouth watering. I want to go back. Nay, need to go back. And since it's bound to happen since I have another Living Social deal, keep me posted for an updated review!",

Now that I am confident in the place I will be trying the ahi tuna burger next time.  The secret surprise was the kids meal. It was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches rolled up like sushi. Very cool, and makes the little one part of the group ;).  I would go back, and potentially try the sushi.  It was a little pricey and service was very very friendly, that may or may not be to your liking.",

Hell, all I heard was his moans of delight! I may be jealous!  Our desserts were awesome as well- we had chocolate in all its glory, mousse for him, cake for me. Neither of us could finish, but oh, what an effort! Sadly, the beer I wanted was out of stock, so I was forced to try another selection, but oh happy day-it was very, very good! Terrapin is now on my short list of breweries to look for. The service was quite good, very attentive without being intrusive. Our waiter was training another who was \"following\" and if the newbie paid attention, he'll be *just fine*, too. This time, we were seated at the other end of the restaurant, near the patio doors. Thankfully no one in their right mind wanted to sit out there, so no opening of the door and arctic blasts... but this is obviously an issue that needs to be addressed. This is the sole reason this and the last review didn't get 5 stars. My advice? Go thou hence, and sample.",

I was quickly moved to another table that was better but underneath an air vent....it is February right?????  My new server introduced herself and told me that she will be right back. I'm still waiting for my guest, so I'm okay. I did notice walking by the sushi prep area smelt fishy, and anybody knows if you walk in a place and smell fish that's a No-No.... has me nervous to get any Seafood from here today.  I browsed the menu waiting for my guest, because it's been awhile since I've been here. My guest arrived and let our server Brittnie know that she was a newbie. She did a great job explaining the menu and how we can tweak it to out liking. We ordered the fusion boxes. One slider, one roll, and 3 sides.   We did experience a delay in our food coming out,  but they sent a free appitizer our way. Nice!  Britt did tell us that there was some deep discounts on wine due to changing to a new wine list. We humbly declined.   Overall my friend is ready to bring her bf back...maybe for a double date!",

In my opinion, the batch I received had wayyy too much cream cheese in it( or at least that's what it tasted like) to where it was overbearing and made my stomach hurt. The salad was good of course cause I really don't think you could mess that up. I pretty much washed it all down with water and settled with the marshmallow crispy treat milkshake. With that and the great staff that served us I still left with a smile and will come back to fulfill my craving.",

The service it's good all the times.   Update: I just went yesterday. The Crab Roll was amazing and my Mango-Cado sushi roll was delicious. My fiance order his burger (Bison) the term was perfect and the service as usual very very good. Staff friendly, attentive and very diligent.",

    "text": "\"Extremely impressed\" is how I'm going to start this for you. When I walked into Cowfish they had a great vibe going on. It is low lighting, ample walking space, but most of all it smells great. Once we walked out to the patio, I was over the moon. They had market lighting, great comfortable seating, and there is an outdoor fountain which really creates a fantastic ambience. But would you really want to know about is the food? I had a great sampling of the menu, and every single one of the items was flavorfully and thoughtfully composed. I was trying to decide what I was going to get seconds of, but I was so stuffed and full and content that I had a hard time going back for more. Talk about a first world crisis. I had the privilege of trying a strawberry milkshake, which I am not usually a fan of fruit milkshakes, ever. However their strawberry milkshake was delicious and perfect. It didn't have a artificial flavor to it, it had big pieces of strawberries in it topped with whipped cream. Overall my experience at Cowfish was a massively positive one, and I am counting the days until I can go back. Well, I might be counting the minutes until I'm not full anymore, because I am officially stuffed and satisfied. Amen, hallelujah, praise The Cowfish.",

Our server was nice, but forgot my side as well as refills. It seemed that he, as well as the other servers were stretched extremely thin.

The food and service is on point! I am vegan so I love that they have alternative options like the veggie burger which can be substituted on any burger choice. They also have veggie sushi too. The bar has lovely drinks, half off martinis on Tuesdays! I have never been disappointed here, the eclectic options on the menu allow this to be a worthy destination restaurant in South Park!",

I am giving it 2 stars because the sushi is still good, but here is a list of the problems we had last night: 1) False creation of a wait by the hostesses--there were at least 20 open tables and we were forced to wait for 30 minutes; 2) we ordered calamari appetizer;  it came to the table without plates or silverware; 3) I went inside and requested plates and silverware from the manager, 5 minutes later I requested them, and subsequently received them, from our waiter; 4) appetizer is consumed but neither the individual plates, nor the calamari plate are removed from the table;  5) I put dirty plates on the empty table behind us;  6) dirty plates remain on empty table throughout our meal; 7)sushi takes about 30 minutes to arrive--strange in uncrowded restaurant; 8) sushi is not made with soy paper, as requested, but we are hungry and want to eat; 9) my husband and I are sharing rolls, but no new plates are brought to the table--we flag down the waiter to request clean plates;  10) oops--no small bowl or ramekin for soy sauce--we flag down the waiter again; 11) we retrieve a dirty plate of ours (still on the table behind us) for my son's edamame pods 12) dinner is over and we have to remind waiter that it is my son's birthday (after previously notifying the hostess); 13) Birthday presentation is lackluster, at best, and my son is disappointed; 14) I am disappointed that Cowfish has fallen so far--judging by the number of empty tables at 7pm, I am not alone in this assessment.",

It's casual but in a swanky place. Came in after my facial next door at hand and stone massage(awesome facial:see hand stone massage review).   The server was nice. I asked some manager or who knows who she was that was passing by for some honey mustard and she looked as if I asked her for her social. I guess it wasn't her forte but she brought it anyway. I went to thank her but she was gone before the honey mustard hit the table lol. But besides that I loved it all.   The server/bartender was very attentive(except when I wanted some hm). Food was delish. I think our food was about 30 something. Def worth it. I love my burger(I ordered the build your own burger). And the sweet potato fries were good. I don't get the fusion part of this restaurant but whatever the food was good. I would Never get sushi at a burger place. But that's just me. Who cares what I think.   Wasn't much of a crowd. It was pretty empty actually(maybe three other people) but it was midday on a Wednesday. Food came out pretty quick. Facilities were clean. Everything was pristine. Love the area. Good parking. Parked right out front. Will go back next time I go back to the massage spot next door.",

And, frankly, the burger side of the house is superb. There are several preconfigured selections available with a wide array of toppings and add on items. There is also a build your own burger with an almost dizzying array of choices for buns, meats, cheeses and additional toppings. Personally, I like a half pound burger on their brioche bun with apple smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese and lots of their cowfish sauce. Other choices for meats include turkey, bison and veggie. And what would a good burger be with out fries? Which are always cooked to near perfection.   The wait staff is uniformly excellent. Pleasant, knowledgeable and attentive. To date, after several visits to this establishment, I have yet to experience even an unpleasant moment. If you need the perfect blending of burgers and sushi with a full bar thrown in just for good measure, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "We moved to Charlotte last year, and so many people have recommended Cowfish that it has become repetitive and annoying.  We finally decided to give it a shot, if for no other reason but to avoid the \"you should try Cowfish\" conversation in the future.  We called on a Thursday to book a reservation for a Friday dinner, but were disappointed to learn that the restaurant does not take reservations.  We went on a Friday, but my wife took too long getting ready and by the time we got there, the wait was two hours.  Carol gets grumpy when she is hungry, so it wasn't going to work.  We ended up going to Taco Mac and having a nice meal.  After the two failed attempts, we decided to go to Cowfish Tuesday at 2:00 pm. Third time was a charm! The boss gave me the go-ahead to leave the office early as long as I promised to try the surf-n-turf roll.   When we walked in, we were immediately seated and provided with menus.  Day-drinking is the spark that keeps our marriage alive, so I ordered 2 cucumber mint-inis.  They were good, but not life-changing.  My wife commented on how small my cucumber was, so I ordered a China Blossom for my second drink.  We hadn't received silverware yet, so we ordered appetizers we could eat with our hands.  The edamame and fried pickles were delivered to our table too quickly, as if they had been sitting in the kitchen ready to go the entire time.  The fried pickles were decent, but the edamame shells were extremely difficult to chew.    It was a chore to read through the entire menu. I broke my boss's promise.  As good as filet mignon smothered with wasabi sounds, I had been having nosebleeds all week and didn't want to ruin another shirt. Nothing on the menu looked good, but we figured that we may as well try and order something to hold us over until dinner. I went with the Arnold Hamandeggar burger, minus the cheese, eggs, ham, and bacon, and Carol ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Mid-way through the third cocktail, I needed to use the restroom.  The waiter directed me there, and his instructions were clear and accurate.  However, the country slang coming from the speakers in the bathroom was distracting and I returned to the table without washing my hands. Thankfully, the waiter had finally provided us with silverware, and our dinner had arrived as well. The burger was very under-cooked and did not have the toppings to compensate, so Carol and I shared the cheesecake. Our first experience at Cowfish was poor, but we will consider trying it again if someone gives us a gift card.",

With Kenny as our host; he quickly gave us the short story version of the 10 page menu, offering suggestions to satisfy everyone at our table. Service was prompt and attentive without being pushy. Food quality and presentation were very good. Too full to enjoy desert at the restaurant, we took a few home with us to enjoy later with late night coffee.  Being from out of town, I won't get the chance to return anytime soon; but my local family is sure to make this a frequent choice in Charlotte.",

The one negative I did see was that the chairs at the bar are super tall and made of stiff wood. Those chairs are made for giants so try to get a table instead.",

Their burgers are good and so is there sushi. My husband ordered the Screaming Korean Chicken sandwich and that thing was the size of his face. It was also really tasty.  I highly recommend the Spicy Togarashi Shrimp for an appetizer because it's amazing. They're lightly battered and have the right amounts of sauce on them, all served over a delicious bed of greens and ginger dressing.  Give this place a try if you're looking for burgers and/or sushi but get there early because they fill up fast.",

We like hooters pickles these are 1000% better. Mostly because they are thicker and fried to perfection. We are just driving through tonight but will visit Charlotte again soon just for Cowfish!

The combination of burgers and sushi is something I'd never seen before but it works great. The best part of the menu, other than it being huge, is that basically everything is customizable. You can create your own burger with 50+ options and you can do the same for the sushi.   Last note, expect a wait. Whether you go Monday for lunch or Saturday night, you will be waiting. Though the restaurant is fairly large, it's quite popular and almost always packed.",

I know we are late to the game, but this was our first time coming here after being told by countless friends just how good the food is. Wanting to avoid the crowds we arrived at around 3:30 and were seated after about 5 minutes. We sat down at a combo booth/table and our waiter Chris came over right away.   For the 2 of you who might read this who have never been the menu is exhausting. There is just so much to choose from you can get lost. Chris was very patient with my husband while he worked through the pages. I knew I wanted a burger, so I got the CBCLT with just the cheese and bacon, and the grilled veggies as my side. My husband got the spicy yellow tail small roll, and we got the Parmesan truffle fries to share.   The Parmesan fries were excellent. The burger was excellent (although I did have to ask for my bacon, but they were great and very fast getting it over). But what surprised me the most was the grilled veggies. They were cut into strips of zucchini, yellow squash, green onions, and yellow peppers. So good!!  I think next time we will have to venture into the spiked milkshakes and split a burger but a great experience, we will definitely be back!",

Very interesting electronic menu/display they had for everybody at the bar, something i've never seen before. We both ordered a burger, sushi as an appetizer, and dessert.  The appetizer was nice and fresh (I eat a lot of sushi so I would know). And I like how it came out on a leaf, with ice underneath it, to keep the sushi cool. The burger came next and that was mouth-watering. Fries were decent, and their fried pickles are excellent (try them if you haven't before!). The dessert... oh man, was this good or what. The chocolate mousse cake I believe.. was spectacular.  I would definitely recommend this place, but make sure to make reservations 1-2 weeks before you come if you come with a party of 4 or more! Otherwise, try your luck at the bar.",

That being said, I've never had a bad meal here. The sushi, the burgers, the fusion, delicious. The togarashi shrimp is a favorite of mine. If you've ever had bang bang shrimp from bonefish grill it's similar but better. The sauce is light but still spicy and the asian slaw is soooo good. I also usually get the Granny's Southern Pimento Cheese Burger.... something about getting pimento cheese and a fried green tomato on a burger is just sinful. So good. I don't necessarily have a favorite sushi dish because everything I've tried has been really good. I also got a milkshake that was the icing on the cake. I literally had to be rolled out of here the last time I went. It was gluttony at it's finest. Would definitely recommend.",

But there is plenty of other options as well. Can't decide between the burger and the sushi? Get the burgushi... that's sushi on a burger. Or what I call a genius invention. Yet no matter what you order, ask for a side of Cowfish sauce. Great with beef entrees.   Stop in on Tuesdays for half-priced martinis. The key lime pie martini is my favorite and comes with a graham cracker rim. Smooth, cool and not overly sweet like I expected. And I sometimes savor in the alcoholic milkshakes. Will they get you buzzed? Not at all but they're a great way to end a meal and perfect to share.   And extra tip, join the Cowfish email club before you go - once you join, you receive a coupon for a free appetizer. I recommend the crab rangoon dip... plenty for the table and it's crab rangoon as a dip... that's #winning right there.   This place is always busy - which lets you know it's worth the wait - so I'd advise calling ahead and trying to stake out a spot at the bar.",

The truffle fries were delish, but I mean you can never really go wrong with truffle. The fried pickles were pretty good and the nachos were semi decent because of the avocado. I ordered the fusion box because I couldn't choose between a burger and sushi. I was definitely satisfied with my choice. The specialty roll that came with the box was very good-little spicy and very flavorful. The mini burger wasn't bad but not the best I've ever had. I usually dont like sweet potato fries but they were very crispy and good. I also ordered a spiked shake ( the no sleep til brooklyn) and it was a nice tasty way to cool off!   As far as service goes, I was very impressed with our waiter. We were in a large group and he brought all of us separate checks which is pretty unusual in New York City so I was appreciative of that.   My only warning would be to NOT sit outside on a very hot day (which is every night during the summer in good ole charlotte). Everyone basically ended up packing their food because it was way too hot to eat anything.   All in all, it was a great experience!",

    "text": "What can I say other than I LOVE COWFISH! One of the best restaurants in Charlotte. A great place to satisfy your raw fish and burger cravings all in one visit. The menu is extensive. I personally have a love/hate relationship with the menu. There is almost too much to choose from and you can do some serious damage to your wallet there. Also, be prepared to wait for a table. There is always a wait but the bar and bar tables are first come first serve. For as many times as I have been to Cowfish, I have NEVER been seated at a table. We usually go straight to the bar to begin our Cow and Fish experience.  This last visit ,we had the Ahi Tuna Salad (YUMMO) as an appetizer. The fish literally melts in your mouth and the seaweed salad is seasoned perfectly. Note, seaweed has a very unique texture. one I happen to love but if you are one of those who can't handle squishy, crunchy and slimy all in one bite, perhaps the Ahi alone is more your speed (and there is nothing wrong with that, just sayin)  My husband and I both had Bento Boxes. I feel this is a good lunch choice. A little beef, a little sushi and some extra yummies added in the box. Who knew Edamame and Sweet potato fries would taste so good together.  Because we always sit at the bar, I can't comment on the wait staff but the bar staff is superb. Very attentive, knowledgeable and because the bar is always heavily staffed, you will get very fast service.",

The wait was over an hour long every single time! I would typically go to the bar while I wait, however theres no space at the bar during the wait. You can watch the little fish that resembles you on the waiting screen for an hour and a half but it gets boring quick. The food was well above average but certainly not worth the wait. The Mexican place next door is a solid plan B if you dont feel like waiting all night.",

I say enclosed because the zippers that sealed the panels were not secured and allowed ample amounts of the 38 degree wind to blow through.   Not only did we wait nearly two hours to eat in the cold breeze but we repeatedly had trash cans and carts pushed/pulled inches past our table on its way to the dumpster which we were conveniently located next to.   Could go on and on about the poor management and empty tables that could have had guests seated but didn't. There are far too many college dropout hipsters running the restaurant and not enough people with restaurant knowledge or experience.",

That's the problem with either not having time to wait or being starved and needing to go somewhere else less busy.  Anyway, I had planned to be at the restaurant shortly after they open on a Saturday morning and that proved to be a good idea, as they were packed and a lineup for tables had formed by the time that we left.    The wife and I split a seaweed salad, a bison burger and a couple of sushi rolls.  The menu here is huge with all the options for sushi, burgers and everything in between.  The burger had some nice chipotle heat to it and was very enjoyable.  The sushi rolls were huge and were \"fusion\" rolls called tropical storm and the south park roll.  They were basically sushi rolls with layers of sashimi on the outside.  All the ingredients were fresh and had great flavors including the smoked salmon, tuna and yellow tail.  The service really blew me away here, as our server was very energetic and explained the menu thoroughly and expertly.  Overall, it was a great first experience for me at Cowfish.  It was a solid 4.5 stars but I will keep it at 4 for now and likely return and upgrade to a 5.",

Was in there yesterday for a late lunch, I ordered the Seared Tuna Nicoise salad and a glass of the Caymus (or was it Caymay) chardonnay.   The chardonnay was incredible subtle hints of fruit and a creamy finish.   Then came the food... They brought out the seared tuna appetizer... did not order that... asked one of the bartenders what this was... it was not the salad so he took it back... then the original bartender came over to apologize.. fine whatever, but could you please ask the kitchen to put the herb dressing and ginger dressing on the side. He said sure and walked back to the kitchen...   Ok, still waiting... finally it comes out. The salad looked lovely and fresh-really beautiful. The dressing were good (not great), but what ruined my lunch was the tuna... a piece was put on my plate that you couldn't even knife through.. WTF, this is the second time... If I had put that in my mouth, I would have lost it... I am so picky about my sushi... REALLY... the first time this happened with the salmon and now the tuna...   Ok, so Meghan, the ultra cool manager was not there, instead it was some shitty manager. I brought the cut of meat to his attention, he apologized but reluctantly.   That really blows... he blows... do I really ever want to go back... probably not. Well at least not for the sushi... I know better than to order sushi so far from the ocean.   Sorry Cowfish... your sushi grade fish blows. Or your staff for allowing that on a plate (TWICE).",

When I heard the owner was opening a new restaurant I had to try the place out.  Remember if you are going to Cowfish to expect a long wait and if you cannot accept that than go early or choose somewhere different. The wait is well worth the delicious food and drinks offered. I ordered a Manhattan from the bar as we waited and this drink was definitely worthy of the cost. It was a very deliciously concocted and as per Manhattan the Maker's Mark was not weak.   To start dinner we ordered the crab rangoon dip which was amazing. In hindsight we did not need to order this app but it was delicious nonetheless. We the ordered a sushi roll each. Having eaten at Eez we knew that the rolls here are huge but once again little did we know one of the plates was massive! We ordered The Motherload which would have been perfect for my boyfriend and I to share. It had so much fish and was definitely a great value. We also ordered another roll that does not come to mind but we loved everything!  I would definitely recommend The Cowfish however if you live closer to the lake or just want sushi check out Eez by the same folks and you will not be dissapointed.",

I am fat guy so that is what i eat so much. My wife always gets the Bento Box with something different everytime as well. This is a go to spot if we are down in South Park and My wife doesnt like going to the same place twice because we are new to the area and are supposed to try new places all the time.

I'm most impressed by the variety of the menu. Every kind of roll you can imagine, and sashimi to die for. The nigiri was good, the sushi was good.

Service was prompt and even though they initially told us it would be a hour wait we somehow got seated after about 10 mins of milling about at the bar area. The interior of the restaurant is very large with a central bar area and even though it was a Tuesday night it was packed out.   For a appetizer we all shared a plate of calamari and it was prepared very well. Maybe a little heavy on the batter but it was neither over cooked or under cooked which sometimes seems to be a challenge for a lot of restaurants. For my main meal I had a tuna burger and it was the best I have ever had. Side of fried pickles.  I can't really think of a bad thing to say about this place. The meal was all around excellent and at around 25$ a plate (app&main) it's well worth it if you are looking for a dinner night out.",

I'm very sensitive so it is always a gamble when trying a new restaurant for the first time but the waitress was well trained and knew exactly what I was talking about. They don't have a separate gluten free menu but all the GF items are clearly marked.  They also brought out gluten free soy sauce for me (always a bonus).   The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the prices.",

They take reservations 11-6, so if you plan to go in that time definitely call the day before because they tend to stay very busy. We chose to sit outside which was nice, plenty of tables, and it was covered as well.   For an appetizer we had the onion rings, very good! They come is small and large sizes, the large had about 7-8 huge onion rings, the dipping sauces are delicious as well, esp the sweet chili sauce.   As my main meal i had a fushion bento box. Complete with sushi, a speciality mini burger, edamame, cucumber salad, and sweet potato fries. They give you plenty of food, i took home leftovers  Overall great experience, i will be back! They have a huge menu so lots of options!",

    "text": "\"Hey, you got your burger in my bento box!\"  \"You got your sushi in my hamburger!\"  The Cowfish is a brilliant restaurant concept that marries the red-hot gourmet burger trend with always popular sushi and other various Asian(ish) food styles.  The prices are a bit high and the service is pushy, but the food is creative and it tastes pretty good too.  You can get a bento box that features a half-roll of sushi, a burger slider, and generous helpings of a few sides.  Mine was $14 and came with sweet potato fries, edamame, and some sort of pickled cucumber and onion salad.  Our server tried to talk me into ordering two full-sized entrees instead of the bento box because it would be more food.  Well, duh.  Two adult sized entrees will be more food, but it will also be twice the price.  And I can't imagine who would remain hungry after polishing off one of these bento boxes.  They are substantial.  The sushi roll was well prepared and fresh.  The slider tasted okay but it wasn't anything special.  It came topped with jalapeno and a spicy sauce.  I also sampled one of the regular, non-sushi full-sized burgers.  It had bacon on it and tasted pretty good, though not particularly memorable.  Passable but not craveable.  Our server kept trying to get us to order extra sides and more expensive items.  I understand that this is part of the job and that a higher bill means more tip money, but gee whiz... this guy was overkill.  After a certain point you've just got to let it go and leave your diners in peace.  I really, really love this concept.  The execution was decent too, although I think the burgers could use a bit of refining.  The prices seem too high by about $2-3 per dish and the service borders on rude, but I would return if I were in the Charlotte area again.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. I'm not really sure how anyone couldn't fall in love with Cowfish. They have it all. Sushi, burgers, milkshakes, sake... they even have fried pickles! Yes, a sushi joint has fried pickles and they are damn good.   First thing you need to know: there will be a wait on Friday and Saturday nights. A long wait. At least an hour. You may even wait on a week night. Scope out the bar. Grab a spot if you see one. Or, put your name on the list and walk somewhere else to have a cocktail or shop while you wait. They do not take reservations.   Specials:  Mondays- 1/2 price cocktails Tuesdays- 1/2 price martinis Wednesday- 1/2 price bottles of wine Thursday- 1/2 price sake  The food: you can't really go wrong with anything here. There's a TON of options on the menu. You may get overwhelmed looking at it. Take a deep breath and dive in to the deliciousness.  I love to order the fusion specialty bento box. I go with whatever the slider of the day is. The sides are delicious. My favorite is the cucumber salad.  Apps: do you like crab rangoon? ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON DIP. It's a deconstructed crab rangoon and it's delicious. It's worth noting again... the fried pickles are damn good. Big Al's Yellowtail, Tuna Nachos, parmesan truffle fires... all fantastic. Your biggest problem here may be narrowing down your order.   Super unique and always worth the wait. This is a great spot for girls night or date night. I love to bring out of town guests here.",

    "text": "I've heard this restaurant mentioned endlessly since I moved to Charlotte over a year ago. Back then I wanted nothing to do with sushi, so I just brushed the recommendations off even though this place was said to have amazing burgers. Fast forward to the present....I've been dragged kicking and screaming to a few local sushi places, so now I enjoy eating it unlike before. One afternoon after shopping at South Park, I decide to give it a shot.  It was early afternoon, and the only seats available were on the enclosed heated patio. My daughter and I enjoyed the decor, really fun to look at. The menu is very huge! I had an idea of what I wanted to order after looking at other people's Instagram dinners.   I couldn't restrain myself, which meant I ordered way too much food, but I loved everything. Daughter and I shared the lobster rolls which were smashing! We both had burgers and I ordered firecracker sushi. I went back and forth between eating a huge juicy burger and delicious sushi! I had no self control. My daughter just shook her head at me. I've eaten at 12 other burger places locally and this one is my favorite so far. I see why it is always packed, I can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Cowfish is an incredible restaurant. It's one of those places, when you have friends come in from out of town, you can't wait to take them to.     I can promise you it has menu items that you won't see anywhere else.  That alone makes them special, but the quality of their eccentric menu is what really sets them apart!      Starting with their famous \"Burgushi\" which combines classic burger-esque proteins like ground beef, steak and BBQ into a sushi roll.  My favorite is the The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi BuffalOOOOO-shi Roll (Sauteed chipotle bison, fried green tomato, grilled onions, feta cheese inside, coated with tempura flakes. Topped with fresh green tomato, chipotle aioli, diced tomato, red onion, jalapeno pepper).  It definitely lives up to it's namesake!  I have tried all the Burgushi's and enjoyed every one of them. If you are taking someone for the first time, try to get them to at least split one Burgushi with you.  Appetizers that are must orders: 1.  Crab Rangoon Dip and Blackened Tuna Nachos.  Both will change your life...trust me!  If you are looking for a really solid traditional Sushi roll, I recommend the: Mad Mango-Cado Roll (Shrimp tempura, kani inside, coated with tempura flakes. Topped with mango, avocado and sweet eel sauce. Served with a side of spicy mayo) This one will work for event the pickiest of sushi eaters.  If you are in the mood for a burger, you can't go wrong with any of them, but I particularly like the:  The Texas Longhorn  (Half-pound beef burger, cheddar cheese, onion strings, jalapeno bacon, tangy BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, brioche bun)",

I was never hot and really enjoyed the outdoor scenery here.  We also have a toddler, so the outdoor patio was perfect for our messy eater.  I ordered our son's food first, the kids' mini burgers, and I must admit the kids food was pretty good!  I also ordered the spiked shake, 'no sleep til Brooklyn' (for Mom).  It was wonderful and I loved it!  Coffee, rum, chocolate, espresso beans, whipped cream, ice cream, yum!!!!  Must drink if coffee and chocolate are your thing.  I love sushi.  But I decided that the Cowfish bento box would be more bang for my buck.  It was pretty good, the mini burger was the best.  I don't like French fries much, but the sweet potato fries were delicious.  I am an avid sushi eater, and I thought the spicy tuna was ok.  Not bad, just not the best.  However, my teen daughter and husband really enjoyed their sushi, as they both eat sushi as much as I do.  They both ordered separate rolls, and theirs looked very good.  The presentation here is great as far as the food appearance is concerned.  I did not give 5 stars because we had a 45 minute wait.  However, it was dinner time on a Friday night.  Also, we waited a long time for our food.  I made a point to order our toddler's food first because he was starving at this point.  Luckily I had some crackers for him.  So expect a very long wait to eat.  But that is typical for good places on a Friday night.  I would come back earlier in the evening with small kids.",

Thumbs up from him on it. Yes, it was as big as it sounds. Leftovers for days.  One thing that was off was the wait for seating. We were told that there was no wait and yet were handed a pager. We ended up waiting for 15 minutes - all the while the the hostess(es) kept saying there was no wait, that they just had to get menus??? Very odd. Otherwise the service was good.",

The tone is casual/fun but still very fitting for the more upscale Southpark audience and myraid of working professionals in the area.  Overall, I think the restaurant's concept works. Would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "OH. MY. GOD.  This place was soooo good. It's expensive, mind you, but the quality honestly begets the price. Some of the most unique and cool burgers I've ever seen. The sushi was damn good, and the \"burgushi\" were just amazing. It tasted like a little bit of everything at different times in its consumption. As it was, I got a burger, one friend got sushi, and another got burgushi, so we could try a little bit of everything. No one regretted their decision. My burger was really big, juicy, and 100% delicious. So they've got that down.  Also, there's so friggin' much on the menu to try, that if you had the money to come back time and again, you could always try something new. The menu is huge and the staff helped us navigate through it, make recommendations, etc. It was almost daunting in its size, which isn't something that happens often, I don't think.  There is no restaurant that serves food quite like this. Go for the uniqueness alone, and leave wholly satisfied by the strange, exotic, and wholly awesome food combinations you just ate.  But, uh, leave with a little bit of a hole burned in your wallet too. ;) However much it may be worth it.  PS (edit addendum): If you need to use the bathroom, do it--there's an audio track that plays in there that teaches you phrases in English vs Redneck vs Malaysian (I think?). Highly amusing.",

    "text": "I was in Charlotte for work and luckly I had a car to be able to venture out to places not near my hotel.  I ended up at the mall and walking around trying to find something to eat that wasnt a chain and I found Cowfish.  The name of course drew me to the place and who doesnt like the thought of burgers and sushi?  I walked in and it was really busy so I asked if I could sit at the bar.  They were prompt with getting me a menu and a drink.  It was my first time there and was a little overwhelmed with the menu but had to navigate it myself since the staff didnt offere to recommend or help me navigate through.  I really wanted a burger and a sushi roll but when I asked my waitress she said it would be way too much food so I decided to have a \"texas\" burger.  The wait wasnt long and the food wasnt bad.  After mid-way through I told myself I should have gotten the sushi.  My only complaint was the staff at the bar.  I had 3 different people waiting on me and had my diet coke only filled once.  My main waitress didnt talk to me much as she was too busy talking to the guy from L.A. next to me the whole time!    All in all it wasnt a bad experience but I suggest if you want a little more 1on1 time with your waiter/waitress you better wait for a table and not sit at the bar.",

    "text": "It's a pity this has to be rated so low because honestly if they executed the food that is on the menu better it could be great. Everything looks wonderful on the menu, and some things look truly interesting, but they arrive pretty but lacking. Costwise it's not at all out of line, if it were well executed, and you get a surprising amount of food when it arrives (which unfortunately isn't a good thing when the food isn't great).   I split the lamb sushi roll with my tablemate and it was the best part of the meal, though the tzatziki was bland. With a bit of tweaking (stronger flavor and fresh herbs) could have made that dish spectacular instead of just good. The lamb itself was well seasoned and the other ingredients worked well with it.   My main meal was the 'ultimate bento' in hopes of getting a sampling of what the food could be, but it wasn't so ultimate. It had clearly been sitting around waiting for a while (it took forever to get it) which did the food no favors, but it was poorly executed to begin with. The sushi roll was soggy (probably from the time sitting), which made for a miserable experience since fried calamari had been in the equation. The calamari ended up a soggy mess in the middle of the roll. The slider was very poorly cooked (one patty was cooked to death and may have even bounced if dropped, while the other was medium and actually spot on), the pimento cheese that was supposed to be on it literally was a smaller dab than my fingernail, and there was just a single soggy shaved pepper on it. The sweet potato fries were no better than what you'd experience in a cheap restaurant, which was also unfortunate since I really like sweet potato fries, but the sitting I'm sure had a lot to do with that as well. The cucumber salad was good, though realistically it couldn't have ever made up for the rest of it.  Overall I'd say save your money. Spend it somewhere where the execution lives up to the description on the menu.",

Remember to schedule an appointment before you go. They get very, very packed. They do have outside seating. Always could grab a few drinks at bar while you wait on your table ;)",

    "text": "Got to try Cowfish during their soft opening a few weeks back and I was blown away. The freshest sashimi I've had in Charlotte can be found right here!   Came here with a group of girl friends so I got to sample a bunch of dishes. First, the appetizers: Crab rangoon dip was rich and full of chunks of crab a delight to dip into with the fried wonton skins. And the Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos - also topped with a bit of that crab rangoon dip - had a great cut of slightly seared tuna on each wonton nacho, yum.   Second, the entrees: I got the Motherload sushi platter (of course the most expensive thing on the menu) and the pieces of sashimi were, again, very fresh, and the sushi roll was damn tasty. It also came with a spring roll whose accompanying peanut sauce came in a martini glass-esque container. The presentation was pretty awesome, mostly because I wasn't expecting such a gargantuan amount of food. I got to sample the mango tango roll, which was great with fresh jalapenos adding a kick to the fresh mango topping, and the grouper entree, which I wasn't a fan of because it was too heavy and not flavorful enough.   Now, third, and finally, the dessert: Creme Brulee was very nice, but the chocolate cake was better-than-your-last-boyfriend-at-his-best good. Man, no one spoke as we shoveled fork fulls of decadent chocolate cake into our mouths. Damnnnnn. Okay, I'm done, I swear. Gooddddd. Okay.   Decor was modern and hip, lots of post modern pieces of art depicting sushi/fish/cow in some form. Hostesses were great in getting us seated. Bartender was helpful in recommending a good beer. Waiter was definitely trying hard to get everything right and was super friendly. Only thing might be that the menu can be a tad overwhelming because there are so many choices, but that's it.   Great date or dinner before a fun night out spot.   Oh Cowfish, I'll be seeing more of you.",

This gave me the impression that service was fast, but that's not the case (more on that later).  We started off with the crab rangoon dip appetizer which took about 20 minutes to come out. It came out hot, fresh, and wonderfully tasty. We decided to try burgers since we aren't big sushi fans. I had the boursin burger. The burger itself had a great flavor and the meat was sinfully tasty. It came on an onion roll which was very fresh and soft. It came loaded with delicious grilled mushrooms and onions. Here are two things that really downgraded the food. 1) the boursin cheese on the burger was horrendous and gritty and 2) it took almost 45 minutes to get our entrees. I sent the burger back and tried it with swiss and it was much better.  But the remake took 25 minutes to come out so I took it to go. I also had a side salad with ginger dressing. The dressing was the best I've had in a while.  If they could speed up service this would be one of the best restaurants around.  But it took us over 2 hours from the time we were seated to complete our meal. That's a bit excessive.  However, the food was very good.",

Our table shared the Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos which was absolutely delish! That's really saying something too because I am not a \"seared tuna\" eater. For my entree, I had one of their \"Burgushi\" bento boxes so I could get the best of both worlds perfectly portioned with a mini slider and pretty much your choice of a sushi roll. I ended my meal with a Shake Crackle & Pop milkshake made with vanilla ice cream, Rice Krispies and marshmellows - yum!!

I've been to severeal sushi places all over the country and this place by far as the most unique and appitizing menu available.  As the name states, CowFish is a sushi bar specializing in both seasfood and meat sushi both raw and cooked.  Their menu features many standard sushi combinations as well as many new and interesting items too.  As well there is a large buger and other sandwich menu for those who enjoy their food cooked.  I'd definately recommend getting reservations as the place was packed at 8pm on a Wednesday, but luckily I got the last available bar stool.  The drink prices are typical for the area and the food is on the higher priced side, but well worth it.  Two things you must try are the Filet Minion sushi roll and one of the (3) sushi burgers which feature a bun made of sushi rice and such.",

Nonetheless, our out-of-town guests loved it and this time we got the bento boxes and they were filled with so much food, it was awesome!  In love with the giant bento box on the wall.  Made my whole day.  The menu is interesting with a combination of burgers and sushi dishes and what they call \"burgushi\" where they combine the two.  Let me warn you in advance, the prices here are high for what I expect to see in Charlotte, comparable to New York prices that I am used to from living up North.  The tuna nachos were AWESOME.  Gotta try them.  I split a surf and turf burgushi with my husband which had beef topped with salmon and tuna.  Was disappointed to find out that the salmon and tuna were cooked, but still a good dish, just not what I was expecting.  Topped off my lunch with a smores milkshake.  YUM.  I've only been here for lunch and heard it's crazy town for dinner.  If you can get a chance to stop by on a weekday for lunch, probably the best time to enjoy the menu without the long wait.",

    "text": "Ok, now the niche of this restaurant is what Los Angeles is desperately to \"cool\" to try  The menu is explained to you and leaves you with a plethora of options to customize your dining experience.   Burgushi: Who the hell would have ever thought? I didnt try it because I absolutely fell in LOVE with the Turkey apple brie and cranberry burger which I F$&ked my mouth with twice on my last visit. Its unbelievable to witness the flavor that will burst into your mouth and nearly knock you out of your seat.   Fried pickles - my FAV for several reasons but most importantly that I didnt spend the next 5 min extracting vegetable oil from them to eat.   Design your own sushi roll = BRILLIANT concept that I have YET to see in any other metropolitan area.  The only thing that disappoints me is the location. I mean after all, location is everything and this wonderful gem seems lodged in the gregarious blunder also known as the south park mall. Where people are just bred differently.   All in all I promise to visit this place each and EVERY time I return to Charlotte no matter what.  P.S. Make sure you wash you hands and LISTEN to the overhead messaged being played. Nothing says HAPPINESS like a little humor before you leave..",

    "text": "All right, let's get some things straight from an unbiased point-of-view:  this is not a real sushi restaurant, this cannot be the best restaurant in Charlotte, and there is nothing healthy on the menu.  It is a concept restaurant teetering on the edge of being a theme restaurant, the menu is incredibly overwhelming, and the food is heavy handed.    All that aside, there are great items on the menu, but it needs to be thinned out a little bit.  This would have been two-stars if it weren't for the fantastic bar setup and one of the best milkshakes I've ever had (rice krispy concoction).    I really wanted to try the \"amazing\" sushi, and I had very high expectations.  I ordered the Motherload, which offers no place for bad sushi to hide.  The roll was way too thick, loaded with cream cheese, and only tasted like the sauces and cream cheese.  I want to taste the raw fish.  The sashimi was also cut thick, which works fine for scallops and some fish varieties, but not for octopus, eel, or shrimp.  I did love the sauce with the summer roll, and the \"no rice\" option worked well to remove some of the weight.  The wine list is well thought out, and surprisingly well-priced, and the touch-big screen games built into the bar are absolutely genius (frog game conquered)!  I struggled not to order burgushi, but after seeing all the massive piles of sushi covered in red meat walk past, the guilt of my decision faded.  I once had a surf and turf roll at Wolfgang Puck's in Orlando that was perfectly poached lobster with thinly sliced, rare fillet on top w/ seaweed and ginger/siracha sauce that was perfection.  Sushi should be light, flavorful, and artistic....Cowfish is miles from that.  I've got to add that the two \"classy\" girls sitting next to me at the bar made an episode of Girls sound tame...and no, the two guys next to me were unfortunately not gay.",

Also, the food is decent, but a tad pricey. With that said, their burgers are AMAZING, and have a great spice to them. However, the sushi is par at best, which ultimately makes me think of this place as a nice American spot.   The interior design is by far the most impressive aspect of this place (see photos), otherwise a decent spot for dinner and I'll probably be back sometime relatively soon.",

Got here around 7pm on a Saturday night and there was a 2 hour wait, so make sure you get here early. Thankfully I found a seat at the sushi bar and sat down immediately(perks to traveling alone I guess!). Ordered almost immediately, food was out in a decent amount of time. Started off with a local beer which was good, wasn't a fan of the tall skinny glass it was served in though. Ordered the taste explosion roll, BBQ pork roll, and the Pittsburgh sandwich. All three were pretty good, but the taste explosion was my favorite. Next is a toss up between the Pittsburgh and the BBQ pork roll. Overall a really good unique place that's worth checking out! A little pricey, but worth it none the less.",

So when I traveled to Charlotte we made a point to stop here.  The decor is very clean, and bright... maybe bordering on kitschy.  Our server was very friendly and funny.  Unfortunately, after ordering we got passed off to another server who we pretty much never saw.  I understand why the handoff needs to occur sometimes, but never like it.  Our food took a while to come out.  One of the rolls were forgotten so it came out after our burgers and was never really eaten.  We both enjoyed our burgers a lot.  Unfortunately it was a few weeks ago and I can't really remember the specifics.  The onion straws were delicious.  There is no doubt about it... this is a burger/sushi place.  The concept is amazing, but I think they could focus more on the food and less on the \"look at us... we're a crazy burger/sushi place.\"",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times, and just have not been able to come away happy. Cowfish has a cool interior, as well as the wait time and higher price you would expect from a restaurant in South Park. Which is totally fine and as expected.  I have them another shot after they re-opened (for the second time) after their rhinovirus scare. It made sense that their lines would be shortest, and their kitchen would be cleanest, after their recent shutdown and extended cleanup.  That was correct, and no one in my party got sick. Indeed, Cowfish was about half full, and I was able to get in and seated immediately.  On my last visit, I was disappointed with some of the burgerushi, but was really impressed with some of the sushi. I was determined to stick with the sushi, which was fresh and delicious.  I'm not sure what my waiter's name was, but it should have been, \"10 minute minimum.\" Because every single thing took at least 10 minutes. It was at least 10 minutes until someone came to my table. Again, the restaurant was hall full.   I am unsure if I have ever had someone take my dinner order after my appetizer had arrived. I am certain that has never happened after the appetizer had arrived but drinks had not. At least, before my recent visit to Cowfish. Pretty certain Chilis can manage such basics, but somehow a place that goes $50/$60 a plate cannot.  I am done complaining about all the waiting I did during my 100 minute long dinner. How is the sushi?  The sashimi is my favorite in Charlotte. Their sashimi is easily the freshest, juiciest, tastiest I have had in this town. Nothing like a big bowl of their fresh fish on ice, especially when it is fantastic fish.  The rolls are good. I would not say better than a number of other sushi joints, but good. Inventive. A little weird (I think mine came with burger sauce or something I didn't try).  I really wish they had better service, because they could potentially be better than Baku, Pisces, Yama, or a number of other sushi restaurants. But my last visit was a disaster, and their sushi is not good enough to make up for their prices, wait, and service.",

If you are planning on going on a busy night, which is most nights for them, I suggest try out their new app where you can put your name on the list while you're on your way there to get a little bit of a head start on the wait list, this place can be busy!  I love sitting on the patio when its not too hot, on the colder days they have it heated and enclosed, it is nice and cozy I would recommend sitting here if your looking for something a little quieter.  The service is always good and the servers really know their stuff so feel free ask for suggestions!  Since I'm a regular here I do have my go to options, I always and will forever go for the calamari it is fan.effin.tastic. I've had a few of the other appetizer options but nothing seems to compare to the calamari! The pork belly burger was my absolute favorite but found out on my most recent visit that it was taken off the menu along with a few other items. I was a little hurt but ordered the Texas longhorn burger in its place and it was beyond satisfying. I love the side options that you're able to choose from, I'm a fried pickle type of gal and they are always great, the dipping sauce that comes with them is sooo good! As for sushi I've been enjoying the fiery dragon roll on my last couple of visits and its been nothing short or delicious, I love the sauce that comes on it, the jalapeno, and the tuna/eel combo totally sold me on this roll. They have a great drink list filled with signature cocktails, sake, and beer. I have had a few of their martinis that I would totally order again and again. I haven't had anything from here that I wasn't too fond of and I always look forward to getting my burger/sushi fix here!  Thanks for being consistent!",

We ordered the coconut onion rings to start, and the small which was four pieces was very large and for $4 a good buy, but ours had problems. Incredibly greasy and one of the rings was the outer portion of the onion which you shouldn't have been used.   The blackened tuna nachos came out next. A great concept, however it's a big mess. You lose the flavor profile of the individual components, aside from the crunch of the chip, the crab rangoon dip, the avocado, the tuna, they are so similar in texture you don't really know what your eating. I would have preferred a dish with all the toppings on the side you can dip into and taste.  The Pittsburgoo-shi was actually the highlight of the dinner.  It was inventive,  flavorful, the prime rib was juicy and the 'bun' was terrific. On the side we had the Thai cucumbers which were light and refreshing, with a kind of smoky heat throughout, just was great.    Incredible service! Our server, Jasmine was attentive and friendly, helping us through the menu (it's kinda crazy how many things are actually on there). She checked in often but without being overbearing. Food and drinks came out very quickly. Two apps and one entree came out to under $40. Would I go again? I'm not entirely sure. Wishing I'd stuck to Burgushi menu entirely.   5 star service, 3-star food, 4 stars for creativity.",

Our server was awesome, and we had a blast sitting outside on one of the first nice days of spring!   The main negative with this place is that they don't take reservations and there is typically a long wait. We waited for 60 minutes on a Friday. (to be fair, I think it's because it was GOOD Friday, but still... 60 minutes is a long time!) If you're traveling with just one other person, your best bet is to hover at the bar or sushi bar and grab a spot there. If you do that, you don't have to wait too long.",

I would recommend sitting at the terrace if the wait is not too long.",

Our server was very sweet and made great food suggestions. We had a sushi roll for an appetizer and burgers for entrees, the lamb burger is amazing and the veggie burger is very flavorful with a compliment of literally a pile of sweet potato fries. The place has a great vibe and SO many options, highly recommended. A+++",

    "text": "I love the atmosphere of this place, but they fall short in so many other places. We went here for dinner last night and we were highly disappointed with both the food and service. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table to start, which is absurd considering there were no less than 8 open tables. We were just a party of 2. We decided to wait at the bar, which is where we should've stayed. We were finally seated, it took our server a few minutes to come greet us. We started with the Lobster and Crab spring rolls, which were fried a little too long, when we brought this to our server's attention he told us it was to make sure it was crispy. We of course never finished those. We asked about suggestions from the menu, the server's response was \"The most affordable way is to make a meal out of one burger to split and an appetizer.\" Now I don't know if maybe the fact that we were dressed in jean and t-shirts made a difference, but to assume we needed to eat affordably was very insulting to say the least. We decided to go with a burger and a sushi roll. My burger was cooked closer to med well rather then medium. I wanted to complain, but our waiter only seemed to be interested in flirting with the table behind us. My friend's sushi was okay at best. To sum it all up, we didn't enjoy the appetizer, main course and weren't even offered dessert. We left feeling total unsatisfied. My friend said that experience was out of the ordinary and I should give them another try, but after that experience I think I would rather not. I would rather dine without judgement and assumption of my ability to afford my meal. Word to the wise, don't dress down or comfortably if you want to dine here.",

Be prepared to fist fight someone for a spot. They do a True disservice to customers by not taking reservations. The wait is typically above 1.5 hours for dinner. Bring protein bars in order to survive. Or better yet, eat before you go out to eat. I offer a few stars because the food is good and the customer service is 5 stars. Outside of that, I wont be going here during dinner again given the long wait.  In terms of customer service - they are receptive to feedback and have apparently tried to take reservations in the past. They did not have success. There is an app you can leverage to add yourself to the wait list (must be a half mile away), and can do some shopping at the mall while you wait.",

I can not say enough wonderful things about this place. From their amazing food, sushi and burgers, very friendly and respectful wait staff, amazing/talented chefs, to their very kind and generous managers. If you want a meal that you will remember with a staff you can't forget, you need to go to Cowfish. They have made my wife and I a customer for life.  If you haven't guessed by now, I would HIGHLY recommend going here for dinner!!",

I have to take one star because the service last time was less than stellar and super slow even though there was a light crowd and the waitress was unfriendly and short, and i had to ask another waitress for a drink and boxes and I did not leave a tip. Usually I tip 20-30% pending on the service received but that warranted 0. However, let's get to why this is one of my fave places in Charlotte and why you should go, thee food!!! The sushi is ALWAYS fresh and amazing. My favorite is the Mad Mango-Cado roll and the cheeseburgooshi! They offer sushi and burger options that are really cool in name and ingredients. I have had their milkshakes both with liquor and without and I recommend trying them both! Particularly the Rice Krispie treat milkshake and the island milkshake with rum. Please stop in if you can, it's amazing food and usually great service! One of the top places in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Wow... What a concept. Who would've thought burgers and sushi on the same menu would work, much less BE AWESOME!?!  Brief background - this is a sushi restaurant + burger spot + bar, all of which on their own would probably be good. Nestled in a larger shopping complex, this spot is remarkably big, with indoor and outdoor seating available. The menu is overwhelming, so do some research or, if you're like me, opt for the bento box.   As noted, I opted for the bento box which gives you a combination of burger elements, salad, sushi roll etc. Its a bit much as I've never had sushi and burgers within the same meal, so be prepared. I'd strongly recommend 'The Boss' though, so check it out.   My only issue with this place is the menu - its really large and quite overwhelming as everything sounds great. That being said, I also say its an opportunity to come back here and try many more items. Also, not sure how sustainable such a large menu is, especially if you want to be \"great\" at either sushi or burgers, so I'll keep that in mind as I try other places on my business trips.   Also, I recommend calling ahead or somehow finding a way to get a table during dinner hour, as I've been told its fairly difficult.",

    "text": "I don't eat seafood so I have to say that I was worried about finding something on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide array of options to choose from. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone. We came around 8-8:30 on a Saturday with 11 people. They don't do reservations which isn't the most ideal, but we were sat within 20 minutes. We sat outside on the beautiful porch that had fans to keep us cool.  Our waitress, Kristen, was outstanding. Dealing with a large party like ours is not an easy task and she fulfilled every request in a timely manner. When our wine took a little longer than the rest of the drinks, she made sure to apologize. We all had separate checks (the worst, I know) and she split up the bottles of wine and appetizers with ease. She was such a lovely server!  As for food, the combination of sushi and burgers is odd, but allowed each person in our party to order something they liked. For drinks, I split a bottle of the Pinot Grigio, which was good. I appreciated that it was brought out in a chilled container to keep it cool outside. I split the jumbo onion rings for an appetizer. The 5 jumbo rings were very delicious and definitely big enough to split! For my entree, I had the \"Burgooshi\" which is basically a burger and some cheese wrapped in rice and potato strings and flash fried. It was very delicious and super filling. We didn't have any room left for dessert after everything! Next time I'm in Charlotte, I will definitely make an effort to stop by again!",

Creamy and crabby with crispy and crunchy wonton strips. Mmmm.  We split a \"Brento\" Box, two mini burgers, 1/2 sushi roll, 3 sides. Honestly that plus the Rangoon dip, I felt so satisfied!   So of course we ordered a shake to go. Also delicious.   Overall, Cowfish is great! The wait time is monstrous, but I think the idea of this place is really unique.

    "text": "Okay wow. I have eaten here a ton and I forgot I had never written a review! My boyfriend and I simply love Cowfish! It is one of our favorite spots around Charlotte, and a plus for us is that it's close to home! You cannot beat the unique vibe and menu that they offer.   You will feel the good vibes from the second you arrive, they always open the door for you and the staff have without fail been a group of friendly and helpful individuals. Now, to all beware, dinner time and ESPECIALLY weekend nights: you will wait!! BUT! It is worth it and you will not be able to deny that. They have a pretty good system in place, I believe now you can add your name to a list via an app before you even get there. They provide corn hole out front to entertain you, often times you can slip into a spot at the bar, and they really do move and try to get you in as quickly as possible. The reason for the wait is just because they do not accept reservations. If you want to sidestep this part of the experience, lunch is ideal for you.  Now, once you are seated, prepare to read the novel menu. Don't overlook or skip over something because it sounds like it won't work or you think it won't taste good--this is a place to try new things and your taste buds will be rewarded for you bravery, I swear! They also have a wonderful cocktail menu and their hot teas are delicious and budget friendly. For the low price you get more servings of tea than I believe a human can consume in one sitting. (My favorite is the vanilla mint chai)  I personally love their outdoor patio. They have fans and/or overhead heat lamps, whichever season you are dining they are ready for you. They have the tables, a cozy seating area with couches, and a fun game section with a life size connect four...fun for both adults and children alike.   My favorite menu item I recently have become obsessed with is the grilled salmon salad!! It is absolutely huge and has the best combination of flavors. The sesame encrusted goat cheese just makes it even more heavenly and I could probably eat a whole plate of these little lovelies on my own. You of course need to eat some sushi, it is consistently fresh and well made. I have yet to try a milkshake here but it seems like they are a hit and I constantly crave one every time I look, I am just waiting for my conscience to lower its guard so I can order one someday :)  So get yourself over here, we all know half of Charlotte will be Christmas shopping at the mall anyway, might as well swing by and enjoy a great meal before leaving the area! Enjoy :)",

The food was delicious: we had the calamari appetizer and it was fried nicely and was atop a tasty Asian sauce (a little bit  of spice may have added a great touch).  I had the bento box w/a very tasty slider, the best sweet potato fries (perfectly crispy & salted), & a fresh side of cucumber salad.  My husband had the burger & loved how juicy & tasty it was & how it was cooked just as he ordered.  My son's sushi variety was fresh & oh so yummy.  Also, the server was kind & attentive.  Cowfish is a must & I think you will not be disappointed w/whatever you choose!!",

The best part of this spot is that the food is delicious. It's not like one of those places that seem cool but food sucks. Also their drinks are very well made-strong and delicious. Definitely get the burger roll. It's not like anything you can get anywhere. I forget the actual name but it's a burger made in sushi rolls - don't worry it's cooked! Also for the drinks... if you like spicy stuff get the hot stoner!",

The portions are just the right size so you can eat the burger, sushi roll, cucumber salad, and edamame without being stuffed but still plenty.    Lunchtime on a nice day can get :20 a: :40 wait.

I was in the area again and decided I'd give Cowfish another shot now that I have a more adventurous palette. I ordered Mark's Roll and the person with me order the Jalapeno Popper Showstopper burger. The roll was just enough food and was definitely high quality fish. It was a little bit expensive for me ($15.50), so I docked a star, but I definitely don't regret it. The person eating with me said his burger was \"much better than he thought it'd be.\" Our waiter (Gabe?) was very attentive and friendly. I'll definitely be back to try more sushi rolls in the future.",

We had lunch here once before and thought our visiting family would like it. All of us left raving about how great everything was. We all shared the tuna nachos and they were incredible. I had a bento box which includes a burger and half sushi roll. They were very easy to work with on substitutions (if you order it, you'll see why this is such a good thing). My wife had a couple sushi rolls, which were amazing, my mom had the lobster rolls, which are more like a tower, even my 7 seven year old loved his kids box, which was way better than most restaurants bother doing for kids. The waitress was great, the atmosphere was really clean and inviting. We got there at 4:50pm on a Saturday, just before the dinner rush began, which I would suggest, given the stream of people that started right after us. We haven't had a bad meal since we've been in Charlotte, but this place still stands out as amazing.",

They have a lot of options and variety on the menu. You won't know what to try. The burgushi is a go-to attraction but even the traditional sushi / sandwiches are can't miss items.  The walls are lined with dope artwork that is really funny. I've tried pretty much everything on this menu and it's all worth it. It's a little pricey so come prepared to spend some dough especially if you're drinking alcohol.   They have great specialty milkshakes as well. Hillary Clinton may not have won but at least we can take solace in the fact that Cowfish still exists in a cruel world where people are marching with tiki torches in the street.   Go try this before North Korea nukes us!",

We went to North Carolina as a day trip and decided to look up a restaurant to eat with good yelp reviews, and let me tell you....we were not disappointed. Everything from our appetizer, main courses to desserts were absolutely amazing.   What I loved most about this place was the diversity in their menu.  I eat a plant based diet while everyone else eats whatever.  A lot of their food options are made from scratch at the restaurant. I ordered a veggie burger and the presentation was so amazing that I honestly wanted to place it on a mantle instead of eating it.    My daughter ordered a box which consisted of slider burgers, and a sushi roll option, she select led the Phili roll and it came with a side of edamame, sweet potato, and a salad.  She could not eat the salad.  My daughter in law ordered the same as I did but she ordered a salad as her side while I opted for grilled veggies.  My grandson was able to order his favorite, chicken tender and fries.  It came with a rice crispy treat and a gummy fish.  The milk shakes were great, our server Joe was SUPERB and knew the intricate details of the menu.  The restaurant is decorated in a bright (not to bright) but appealing decor.   The only bad thing I could think to report is that they do not have a location in Charleston, SC (hopefully the owner/mgmt. reads this hint).   We will definitely plan another day trip just so we can return for lunch / dinner.",

Of course they have really good sushi but they also have a decent line up of burgers, and even what they call \"burgushi\" which is basically beef done in a sushi style roll. They also have other meats done in sushi style rolls as well such as turkey and even bison. I gotta say it's definitely an interesting experience. All in all it's done quite well. They even have \"adult\" milkshakes which are delicious, though very filling. I'd urge you to make a separate trip for a milkshake, as having one with or after dinner might be a bit much for most. All in all I recommend cowfish to anyone, especially those who want to travel a bit off the beaten sushi path, it's well worth it.",

My husband and I returned and unfortunately we encountered the slow service, inattentive server, and mistakes with our order.

But with that being said, they have a wide variety of food/susi -  something for everyone from the most adventurous eaters to the pickiest.   I can't remember the name of the sushi roll I got, but it was delicious! I'm a little wary of trying new things, but the waiter was super knowledgeable and gave me some stellar recommendations.   I stuck to the regular fish sushi, but they have sushi rolls that incorporate pork, beef, chicken, etc. as well.  I can't wait to take my hubby here!",

    "text": "I had been eager to try this restaurant before it was even open and I saw the sign for Cowfish (Burgers & Sushi) and I thought to myself \"wow, I wonder how this is going to work\" But despite some initial skepticism, my curiosity along with the slew of great reviews won me over. My date and I went on a Thursday evening so I knew it would be busy (I called ahead and they didn't have any reservations) so I braced my company for a 15-30 mins wait on a table and we waited on the bench outside with a pager. We waited about a good 40 mins and other than the hostess asking if we wanted to sit at the bar (which we turned down) our pager never went off although we saw several groups of folks leaving so we finally just went inside again and of course it turns out there was space now and the pager was had didn't alert us :-( but once we finally got seated things started picking up. We had new waiter being helped by a veteran serving us and she gave a pretty long spill to cover the menu (which is pretty vast) took us a few minutes to digest it all which gave us time to enjoy our martinis and the ambience. I was torn between the Aronald Hamegger & the La Rose Sushi Roll  (ended up going with the latter) which was a shrimp based fusion.  My date went with the four play roll (oyster/salmon combo  fusion roll)  both 8 piece sets. We both tried each other's choice and they were both phenomenal, some of the best sushi I've ever consumed in my life, hands down! The portion size was more than enough without even getting appetizers or desert. I look forward to trying some more of the extensive menu on future visits. Just be sure to make a reservation or pack some patience because if you do, your dining experience will be well worth the wait.",

The place is much bigger than it seems, two large indoor wings and one heated outdoor patio.  The decor is cool and funky.  Hubby and I each got burgers, which were very tasty.  MIL got a grilled salmon sandwich which she gushed over and said something like it was the best sandwich she'd ever had(!) Service was meh.  It really was.  The hostess was nice enough but the server didn't do the after-you've-been-eating-for-a-minute check in.  That irks me. He was MIA when we needed takeout boxes. Basically he was MIA from order taking (a food runner brought our food in) till check drop. We might come back to try the sushi once I can eat raw things again, and if that's good they'll earn another star.  Or if we come back and our server is more on top of his/her game.  But as it was I can just say okay.",

We arrived around 8, given a pager and told the wait would be 15 to 30 minutes for first available.  We were paged 25 minutes later, but when I approached the hostess stand was told the buzzer malfunctioned and our table wasn't ready - while a party who arrived after ours was escorted by the hostess to their table.  Hmmm?  Ten minutes later, we were escorted to the back of the restaurant, past 3 empty and set tables, to the table next to the kitchen door.  I protested and we were given another table with an amazing server, Erin.  The food quality was so-so -- not worth a 40 minute wait or the poor customer relations experience.  Charlotte has many fine restaurants.  I think I will give them my money in the future.   If it weren't for Erin's great service, I would give 2 stars instead of 3.",

Being the sister restaurant to the magnificent eeZ Fusion in Birkdale, I had high expectations... and I was not disappointed!  I talked to owner Marcus, met another owner, Allen, and made a new BFF with Deborah, their most gracious service manager.  The bar staff is the best!!!  Shout out to Pat, Jason, Josh, Dave, and Sarah...  The decor at the former location of The Counter is fun and bright with very cute canvas wall art.  I dined on blackened tuna nachos for an appetizer, and a delicious broiled grouper topped with blue crab, served with sauteed asparagus and yellow squash and kaffir lime butter laced pasta as my main course... so magnificent!!!  While I was tempted to partake of their spirit (liquor) spiked ice cream milk shakes, I refrained since my mouth was primed for a yummy creation I saw being served to various patrons throughout the restaurant.  Indeed, \"The Mousse is Loose\" is a huge portion of chocolate brownies with chocolate and vanilla mousse, and is a sweet indulgence for the eyes.  However, when it was time for me to indulge... the mousse was definitely loose, and had left the building!  They ran out of the decadence!!!  Oh well, I had the apple pie wontons which proved to be a formidable substitute, especially when topped with vanilla ice cream... yum!  I look forward to my next visit, as I enjoyed a wonderful dining experience.  I wish them all the best on their new culinary adventure.  And when I return, perhaps I will eat dessert first!",

We were very impressed when we arrived for our reservation and were immediately taken to our table.  To bad it was the WORST table in the whole restaurant.  We ended up in the very back by the doors leading out to the porch area (apparently they were serving out there also).  We were treated to a blast of cold air each time the doors were opened.  As usual the food and service was phenomenal. But being sandwiched between blasts of cold air and waitstaff bumping our table as they tried to get to the kiosk or kitchen really put a damper on the experience.  We'll certainly be back to Cowfish but we'll just be more specific about our seating choice.",

Tip: look for The Residence Inn and you can't miss it. My husband and I were in Charlotte for a wedding and wanted to eat something different than the typical restaurants in Cali.  The ambiance was great! This place really marrys sushi and burgers which seems impossible until you actually eat here. They had a lot of options for the nonred meat and nonpork eaters like myself. We started with the crab and lobster spring rolls which were awesome both to the eye and to the taste buds! I had the bento box which was a perfect pairing of a slider (turkey burger) sweet potato fries (very good) edamame (stemmed and salted) 4 Cali rolls (fresh and flavorful) and sweet/spicy cucumbers (good). I couldn't finish all my food and my combo was a perfect balance of burger and sushi. My husband had a cheeseburger and onion strings which he said was very good. I would recommend this place to anyone regardless if you eat sushi or not. I'm not one for raw fish and they separate raw sushi from cooked rolls on the menu. Great idea!",

This time I had a burger and it was also pretty good (although my medium rare burger was WAY on the rare side of medium rare) . Here's the thing though. The food is not really all that . . and in a place crowded and loud and expensive I really need the food to be all that and it's just not. It is very trendy but for me trendy is kind of a bad thing. I can go to Fudruckers and get a burger that's just as good and not leave with a headache. So yeah I'm taking them down to 3 stars.

    "text": "We  stopped in here for lunch today. We were sat down right away at about 11:50, and by 12:15 the place was packed up. I would highly recommend putting in a reservation so that you can get a table and not wait as long. Whether you reserve or test your luck, it will be worth it either way.  Cowfish is a combination sushi bar and burger joint, but our party only had burgers so that's all I can vouch for. The burgers were a bit steep in price (ranging from $10-$15) but totally worth the price. You won't find a normal bacon cheeseburger here, and all the burgers are made of the best quality meat and toppings, and most of the burger options are a bit different, and HUGE!!! I ordered the C.B.C.L.T. ($10) which was a burger with sharp cheddar, white cheddar, and bacon on a brioche bun. I substituted the beef burger for the bison burger (extra $4) because I prefer bison to beef for the leaner meat and superior taste. It was a gigantic burger that took up a good chunk of my plate. Filling out the rest of the plate was a heaping order of sweet potato fries. There were so many that my wife, mother-in-law and myself were unable to finish even half the order. I'm not big on drinking alcohol with lunch, so I stuck with the mango iced tea which was a very tasty \"unsweetened\" iced tea, and I would recommend it if you're into unsweet tea.  My wife went with the fresh basil pesto turkey burger ($11) which pretty much speaks for itself. It was a good turkey burger with some nice spice to it, and the pesto tasted pretty darn fresh. She got the fried pickles as a side and absolutely loved them. My mother-in-law had the seared ahi tuna burger ($11) which was pretty good, aside from the fact that she ordered the tuna cooked MEDIUM (I gave her a stern lecture later on about that fiasco). That was served on a whole wheat bun with veggies and slaw with a ginger dressing.   The burgers here are very delicious. Our bill came out to $44 in the end, which may seem a bit much for lunch for three, but it's totally worth the price. You can really taste the freshness in the burgers and the portions are insane! I highly recommend getting your butt here if you crave a great burger and are near the South Park Mall.",

I had some coworkers that went just about every week for the $5 martinis on Tuesdays or the half-off wine on Wednesdays so I finally decided to try it for myself. The bf and I went on a Friday night, a little after 8 - the place was PACKED. We were told it would be a hour and a half/forty five minute wait but the seating around the bar and sushi bar was first come first serve, so we hovered around that area like hyenas on the prowl and less than 10 minutes later 2 stools opened up. I ordered the crab and lobster spring rolls, they were pretty good. I like that they have a build-your-own sushi roll feature on the menu, I've never seen that anywhere else before. Not actually \"build you own\" as in you make it, but you choose whatever you want. My bf ordered a burger and fries and a milkshake. Overall, the food was about an 8, and I would come back here just because it's a unique, different experience, but it's not anything I just gotta have.",

    "text": "Cowfish is one of those rare restaurants that is able to take two random food groups (burgers and sushi) and meld them in such a way that once you've been, you can't seem to remember why you thought it was so random in the first place. I'll base my review on the two times I've dined there - once for lunch and once for dinner. Here's the scoop:  Be sure to get a reservation. This place is constantly slammin' and each time I went there was a long wait (an hour for lunch and 2.5 hours for dinner). Good thing we thought to call ahead or I would not have had the chance to indulge....  The decor is interesting. Everything from the red walls to the cartoon art to the voiceover in the bathroom translating sayings...all eye catching and very entertaining.  Parking is not a problem. You may have to head over to the parking deck, but it's not too far of a walk.  Service is great. Our server was very informative, attentive, and friendly both times we dined. The manager came over when we went to lunch, and since it was my boyfriend's first time, gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit. That's a great way to keep people coming back.  The food is phenomenal (and good luck narrowing it down with that crazy large menu). In terms of appetizers, I've had the crab rangoon dip and the coconut onion rings - both of which I'd have again. But if you're only going for one, get the dip - not low fat by any stretch, but totally worth it. I've had the tropical storm roll and the mango tango roll as entrees - both of which were some of the best sushi I've had - but ask them to slice into 10 pieces instead of 8 - when sliced into 8, the pieces are just way too big. My boyfriend had a burger and has been talking about going back ever since. We also got a chocolate and a mint chocolate milk shake to go and they were so thick that we had to wait a bit for the ice cream to melt to really enjoy them (as all milkshakes should be, in my humble opinion). The drink menu is also very extensive and I can't wait to go back to try some of their martinis. And all prices are reasonable for the location and sheer amount of food you are given.  Ultimately, you're missing out if you don't try Cowfish. Just make sure to call early for a reservation (I know, I know - I said that before, but I don't see the wait times dwindling any time in the near future).",

    "text": "So, after exchanging a couple of e-mails with someone from the management team at Cowfish, I made an effort to visit the restaurant.  You can read about my initial experience in my first review.  However, the person from the management team provided a reasonable explanation for why they are reluctant to seat too many patrons at one time (they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen staff and compromise the food quality).  Moreover, the person I exchanged e-mails with was very interested in making sure that my future experiences at Cowfish would be really good.  He even wanted to send me a gift card to compensate me for the inconvenience from last Saturday.  I turned down the offer for the gift card and the offer for \"special\" treatment.  I feel that a restaurant should do a good job of attending to everyone - not just folks who have complained.  But, I give the management a TON of credit for working so hard to make this restaurant successful.    With that as an introduction, here's the scoop on Cowfish.    The food was really good.  Surprisingly good, actually.  I ordered a cucumber appetizer with sweet and spicy sauce, and then I ordered two rolls.  One roll was a specialty roll - Mark's Roll - and the other was from their \"Burgushi\" menu.  All three items were excellent.  The appetizer was huge, and very reasonably priced.  The sauce/dressing on the cucumbers was tangy and spicy, yet it wasn't too heavy or too hot.  The special roll - Mark's roll - was fantastic.  It had jalapeno, tuna, cream cheese and a bunch of other items.  The roll was flash fried and served with a spicy sauce on the top.  The \"burgushi\" roll was called \"Doug's Filet\".  Basically, it was a Philly roll covered with filet mignon (seared slightly, but still very raw).  This roll was huge, and it was very heavy.  However, it was also very tasty.  I didn't like this roll quite as much as Mark's Roll, but it was still an item I would order again.    My girlfriend also ordered a sushi roll - from the \"make your own\" menu - as well as a Cowfish bento box.  The Cowfish box contains a mini burger, a small roll, and some side items.  It's a great deal for $11.     I was surprised to find that Cowfish is actually a good value.  The rolls I ordered were $14, but they were huge.  Two of them left me absolutely stuffed.  (In fact, I couldn't finish all of the food I was given.)  With the appetizer, three beers, the bento box, and three rolls our tab was $72.  Not bad at all for Charlotte.  A few last comments... Cowfish is really, really noisy.  The atmosphere is fun, but it isn't a place for an intimate conversation. And, unfortunately, the service still isn't great.  The folks we interacted with were very kind and helpful.  (Which was not the case last Saturday.)  However, the restaurant is so popular right now that they are struggling with some basic issues.  We waited almost ten minutes to get our first beers.  Our server was VERY apologetic.  He said the back up was due to it being half priced martini night.  That's not a very compelling excuse, though.  They know in advance that it is half priced martini night.  They know they are very popular right now.  It's important to have enough staff to serve all of the customers in a timely fashion.  At the end of the meal our server - an incredibly nice guy - seemed to go AWOL.  I think that this was due to his waiting on the manager to come by to visit us as first time customers.  It's nice that the manager checks in with first time customers (even giving out a coupon for a free appetizer on the next visit), but I value my time more than I value a free appetizer.  I was tired and I was ready to go.  Yet, we didn't have our bill.    I would give Cowfish 3.5 stars right now.  I suspect that the service will improve over time, and I can easily imagine it becoming a 4 star restaurant.  I certainly look forward to going back.",

My only \"complaint\" is that the atmosphere is just a little above a fast food restaurant, a little disappointing given the prices. Also our wait person was a little cranky, seemed like she just wanted to get rid of us for the next customers even though they were not crowded. A good wait staffer would engage in conversation after I announced that we were first time visitors and really enjoyed the meals, a little enthusiasm would have been nice.  Will definitely will go back again, perhaps will sit outside for a better ambiance.",

I came here first with my family. We started with edamame. You might think it's hard to mess up steamed soy beans, but I've been to many places that just can't seem to get it right. Cowfish served up some delicious edamame. We then split three rolls (Miss Moffitt, Marks Roll and Tropical Storm) The fusion sushi rolls are expensive, but keep in mind they are entree size. Each one was better than the next. The tuna was fresh, and the ingredients in each one complemented the fish but did not overpower to roll itself. I came here again with my husband and had an equally good experience. i will be back again to try some burgushi!",

Now this place is not a restaurant you go during peak times. There will be a wait, you will have to wait outside or cramped inside, and you will drive yourself crazy watching closely to see if your fish ( your place in line) is getting bigger on a giant screen.   Appetizer wise you can't go wrong with the crab Rangoon dip or the truffle fries! My go to entree is the bento box because their menu is big and i can never decide if i want burger or sushi, and the box offers both. The cucumber salad is honestly the best thing in the box, skip the sweet potato fries and get extra cucumbers! I've had a couple of their burgers. They are huge, flavorful and very filling! Their sushi is so yummy and fresh, never had any that i did not like!  Service is good, but can be lacking due to them being so busy. Prices are decent for what you get but this is no cheap date. This place is full of everything from kids birthday dinners to anniversary dinners and get dressed up or stay casual, it all seems to work here.",

We were able to get seated right away as they had  plenty of seating in the back patio. The patio is heated, so we were very comfortable during our dining experience.   Spectacular service! Our waiter was so patient with us, answered all our beer and hamburger questions and was checking in on us throughout the meal to refill our drinks. Also have to mention, that although the restaurant was busy and we had already finished our meals, we were not rushed at all! The manager even came around and asked us how we liked the meals and chatted with us about his hometown as he found out some members of my party were from the same place he was. All staff was so friendly!!  I ordered the Fusion Specialty Bento Box  - with this option you can select which hamburger and sushi you want. I went with the Boursin Bacon Burger and Dion's OMG! Roll. I would highly recommend both options! I was recommended by the waiter to try the fusion rolls as those are specialties to the restaurant. Glad I listened!  The bento box also came with  sweet potato fries, Thai cucumbers and edamame. Would order the same thing all over again!   I also ordered the fresh Meyer lemonade with yuzu sauce. Excellent spin on lemonade!  Great Food & Great Service!",

    "text": "Once the best place in Charlotte, the last few years have been rough enough that I had to edit what was once a glowing review.  Even though the wait times have always been astounding, the quality of the food and most importantly what used to be stellar service provided by tenured staff would make up for it, in spades. Our family ate here at least once a month, often more, and would bring out of town visitors there, many of whom would return and request a return visit.   About a year ago we started noticing a lot of staff and management turnover, accompanied by service level drop off. We stopped going regularly due to tons of errors and mediocre service, but still dined here occasionally. Then about 4 months ago had a horrible experience with a server changeover during shift change when we had guests visiting. A table of 8 and only one order correct. Correcting this was a 30 minute experience.Some people didn't even have food by the time others had finished. Management knew they'd screwed up and gave us some comp cards to bring us back. We were so put off that we waited until recently to return.  Another new server, only this one lost control of her tray, and dumped a glass of red wine on the table and on my wife's clothes. She and a nearby manager scrambled to clean up and get a new glass of wine, but when we mentioned the clothes, they ran off, and didn't offer to clean them or pay for cleaning, as would be expected. While I'm fuming about this, the same manager arrives with our food, dumps my plate on the table knocking the burgers over/open, and while handing a plate to my son, dumps half of his fries on his lap ~ At this point I'm dumbfounded that they just literally threw food and wine at us; my wife has red spots on her clothes, my son has grease spots on his shirt and pants, and no one has tendered an apology. Oh, and they \"forgot\" my wife's sushi, and it took another 10 mins to reach us. Pics of the fries on the ground and the empty place where my wife's sushi should have been are attached.  We got a single apology from the server, and a $22 discount on the almost $100 check.  After 5+ years of regular patronage, they lost us. We won't be back.",

Why you ask? GOBBLE-GOBBLE USHI!...  ...It sounds gimmicky right? I remember my first encounter with it about three years ago and I said to myself \"OK I'll get it to try it, but it can't be as good as a real turkey dinner...\" Boy was I WRONG! Roasted turkey, fried green beans, holiday stuffing all inside a soy wrapper. Thin sweet potato strings wrapped around the roll and flash fried. Topped with more green bean, cranberry sauce, and gravy... I was telling Chris the manager tonight how if they were open on Thanksgiving, we'd just drive to the restaurant! Outstanding flavor and perfect harmony. Textures are what really have the potential go wrong with all these different ingredients, but they've executed everything thoroughly and it has an amazing contrast between crunchy and soft!  This is a bit backwards, but let me talk about tonight's appetizer: Blackened Tuna Nachos. Everything about this dish takes each individual element and amps the quality to world-class. The best tuna served rare and just seared on the surface, crunchy and rich pita-like chip, crab rangoon dip, outstanding guacamole, and finished with micro-greens, tomato and onions. Each individual component is a superstar all on it's own, but put them together and it's straight magic!  Our service was impeccable. Chris stopped by the table at the beginning and the end of the dinner service and is definitely adept on ensuring the guest experience is top notch. Our waitress Maggie was as good as it gets with a prompt greeting as we sat down and getting our food out with what seemed like almost no wait between courses. Speaking of wait, they told us about a 30min wait when we got there and it ended up being less than 10! What more could you ask for?  We got desserts to go, absolutely stuffed with the appetizer and entree. Again, there's a reason out of all my reviews (102 as of this update), Cowfish is still #1 in my book!",

I had pretty high expectations for this place and it left me curious and bewildered. Crab rangoon dip. Calamari. Peach blossom tea and mango cado roll with spicy mayo. Everything was mediocre except the flavorful delicious tea. The mango cado roll,  especially lacked any ooumfph and quickly became a disappointment. The spicy mayo in the side was quite different than the usual and I liked that ! Parking is in a large complex, as the restaurant is attached to a rather large flat mall looking space. I'd say , and I'm sorry to say it - the many offerings does not out weigh the lack of excitement in the food. I flirted with a 2 buy settled on a 3.",

We came here last night for my girlfriend's birthday. She wanted sushi and we wanted to try two different rolls so we split the firecracker and the blackened tuna roll. Both were incredible and we had no problem finishing both off. The rolls we ordered came with 9 pieces of sushi and it ended up being plenty of food.  A complimentary double decker chocolate cake with whipped cream and chocolate flakes was the perfect ending to a birthday dinner; thank goodness she was willing to share. I know it is tough to get in and get seated here at times but that is the reality of good, quality restaurants.   If you have not tried cowfish you are missing out.",

I ordered the thundering herd burger and again...... completely blown away. It was phenomenal!!!!!!!!  I ALSO ordered the marks roll sushi...... which never came out.... but they completely rectified themselves.  I told the server it didn't come out and I was cool with that, I didn't anticipate being so overly stuffed.... so she removed it from the bill.... great.... but then the service manager came over with a fresh roll made to go for me. That went way above and beyond. I was cool with it just coming off the bill....  of course I ate it later that night..... IT TOO WAS GREAT !!!!  They nailed it on all 3 of my orders. Definitely going back.",

We didn't have it, but the crab rangoon dip smelled and looked delicious. it was recommended by several around us, and by the server, but ultimately you can imagine its just a deconstructed crab rangoon.  So, instead we tried the Lobster spring rolls. They came out in the most elaborate presentation and they tasted phenomenal.  There was a sauce on the side with a great deal of spice.  You could use as much or as little as you wanted.    THE DRINKS!  So, we tried several cocktails as well. And, boy were they amazing.  I couldn't tell you how much I appreciated the servers recommendations, and their nice twist on the old fashioned (my go-to bourbon drink).

This restaurant definitely has it. Our server (Alison?) was great from the get-go. She offered suggestions and never left the table without picking up a straw wrapper here, an empty plate there. She even brought us new silverware after our appetizer course. I watched as she seamlessly handed off an iced tea pitcher to another server who was passing by. This small interaction that would normally go unnoticed, told me that this restaurant values teamwork and taking care of guests above everything. Here's where they proved that they take care of their guests... We were dining out on the patio, and my sister-in-law was feeling a little warm, so she went inside to get in the A/C. The servers inside noticed her looking not so good, and my SIL fainted. My husband and I were still outside so we did not witness the incident, but Alison came to get us quickly. Another patron who was dining was on the ground with my SIL, and another server was already on the phone with 911. We were right inside the door to the patio, but no server ever made us feel like we were in the way. They were so helpful and quick to get us anything we needed, and everyone was concerned about my SIL. The quick action on all the staff's part was much appreciated in such an unexpected situation. Alison boxed up our food for us, and another server got us a to-go water and wet a cool rag for my SIL. The manager took down some information from my husband so he could call and check on how my SIL was doing. I appreciate the service from every staff member we interacted with and commend the managers and owners for valuing the wellbeing of all customers.   Thank you to all the staff at The Cowfish! (SIL is feeling much better, by the way.)",

The hostesses at the front were nice and our waitress was also nice and attentive. Everyone enjoyed their entree. I had the bison burger which was good. My husband had the lamb burger and he really enjoyed it, he also had the birthday cake milkshake he enjoyed that also.. The crab dip was good. Family enjoyed the food. Will be back.",

The sushi is goooood, I had the North Hills roll and although pricey ($14 for one roll) it was worth every penny. The drinks are on a higher side too but everything was good to compensate for the price. Service was good and attentive. The only downside is the wait time otherwise I recommend checking this if you love burgers and sushi or just sushi!",

    "text": "After having visited the Cowfish table at Yelp Gets Lucky (cough, cough-maybe three times), I was so impressed by the medium rare burgers and chunks of sashimi tuna, that I was inspired to go.  Fast forward one month.  Sounds like a great place to go with the family after The Nutcracker. Yelp app = take me there, please of course.  Wow, this place is huge (and that was inside)! And just look at that fish tank! Pretty and classy! The patio is definitely the way to go - enclosed with heaters and the perfect mix of brisk and warm.  At first I was a little turned off by the size of the menu (Cheesecake Factory Encyclopedia Menu Flashback alert!) but it's broken into easily digested sections (hehe - pun intended).  Anyone that carries Wicked Weed Tyranny Red IPA is near and dear to my heart - this beer is beyond amazing. Really well chosen selection of beers!  Okay - hold the phone. Who thought it was a good idea to take a giant New York Barrel Style dill pickle, slice it thick and then deep fry it? Because I want to shake your hand - pure genius - BEST fried pickle I've had in Charlotte yet!!!  The Boursin Bacon Burger was more than one human can eat - the toppings themselves, Boursin Cheese, bacon, sauteed mushrooms and grilled onions were a meal!!!  The Bento box with your choice of mini burger and sushi is bound to be a winner. Why? Because you choose what comes in it!!! The edamame are a delicious and addictive side!! Get them!!  Don't get me started on the kid Bentos! Okay, you did! Ninja Nuggets! Real pieces of chicken not processed crap! And if you don't go gaga for the kid sushi dessert (Rice Krispy treat with Swedish fish) and say \"aw it's so freakin' cute\" then you probably don't think puppies and kittens are cute either.  Now for the hand spun shakes... Vanilla with Mango and Raspberry - an ice cream lover's fantasy!!!   Can't say enough great things - they must have some magic formula that just makes things work!!! Awesome job guys and gals!!!",

He knew a lot about the menu and really helped my guest figure out a way to get/try everything she wanted to for the best price. He was polite and on point with everything.   I ordered the half portion of the Parmesan truffle fries because the app size is massive.  These things are to die for. I mean...once of the most yummy things I've had in a long time.  The Deliverance Roll here is just like the \"High Class Hillbilly\" Roll in Orlando. It was just as I remembered. The BBQ was so moist and flavorful, the bacon infused coleslaw was amazing, and the crispy potato straws on top added a nice crunch. Love love love.  I finished off the meal with a Rice Krispy Treat milkshake that really hit the spot.  Good on you, Cowfish!",

What's really nice is that you can customize your box with the sides and 4 piece sushi roll of your choosing. I wasn't a fan of the edamame but our server was kind enough to bring me another side at no additional charge. Other than that, the bento box was a great way to sample several different items at once and was quite tasty. Our server was super nice and very knowledgeable. Overall, it was a really good experience definitely worth a try. Oh, and definitely check out the bathroom. It's pretty cool!",

Very crowded on a Friday night but the bar is huge so we were able to score seats at the bar after about 20 minutes waiting for a table. Kristin was our sever and she was absolutely wonderful! Very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She gave us some great recommendations for first timers!   As others said, the menu is overwhelming! There is so much to choose from and almost everything sounds delicious. We went with the crab rangoon dip and shishito peppers to start. The dip is a must get! My boyfriend and I split a burger and a sushi roll. They do have bento boxes if you don't have someone who wants to split with you. I was not a fan of the sushi roll we got (Dion's OMG Roll), but I think we just ordered poorly. There are a lot of other rolls I wanted to try. The Boursin Bacon Burger was absolutely delicious! You can't get a burger with boursin cheese anywhere.   I definitely want to go back and try some of the other menu items!",

Came here for my husband's birthday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes but didn't wait long at all. Maybe 15 minutes. They have a good mix of specialty drinks. I wanted to get a milkshake but was too full to get it.   We got the crab dip. I saw it was highly recommended on YELP and was very pleased. It's a very large portion. We could barely finish it. The dip was creamy with large chunks of crab in it. Chips were large and crispy. That sauce that's on it really made it delicious. Everything mixed together was just amazing!!   I got the shrimp tempura roll. I was surprised at how big it was. It was awesome, especially with the siracha sauce. I also got the Taste Explosion roll. It was my first roll like that. It was flat with ground beef, jalepenos, onions, some type of amazing sauce with a tomato and cilantro sauce on it with cheese. It was wrapped with seaweed and rice. It was delicious!! It was large and very filling. Ground beef was amazing.   My husband got the firecracker roll. He said it was one of the best sushi rolls he's ever had. He also said he can tell the ingredients were really good quality and very fresh.   I secretly told our server, Bryan that it was my husband's birthday and he made it so special. They came out and sang to him and gave us a birthday cake! The cake was huge! Chocolate layers with an awesome layer up top. Bryan was such a great server. He was very helpful and was super attentive. Highly recommended!!",

I ordered the yellowtail appetizer and it was great but the slices of the fish were too big.  I ordered the bento box for dinner.

Atmosphere of the restaurant was gorgeous and in a very nice area in Charlotte. Our waitress was the best and knew the menu like the back of her hand. A few of us ordered cocktails and we greatly enjoyed them. We ordered a few appetizers which I can say the calamari was a hit for me. My colleagues stated the mini burgers received 5 stars as well as the crab Rangoon dip, neither I tried though.   We ordered a selection of different rolls to try and as always the California roll is a hit for me. I took a picture of the beautiful presentation of the Deliverance roll with pulled pork but I will say after high recommendations I tried the Doug's Filet roll with filet mignon and it was very good!!! Some I didn't try but our table was clean by the time we all left.  When I visit one of the other three cities this restaurant is in I hope it's just as great as this one.",

    "text": "The Cowfish is one of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte. It has a special aspect in that you can bring sushi haters with you, as they have a full burger menu. :)  We went for lunch on April 7th, and got there around 11:45. When we walked in we were told there was a 15-30 minute wait, and we could wait at the bar if we liked. We ordered some blood mary's (which were amazing), and parked it for wait for lunch. The Cowfish fills up early and is always busy, so a wait is expected unless you get there exactly at opening.  We watched people come and go, and then noticed that people who came in after us were being seated. My lunch mate went to speak with the girl who asked us to wait at the bar, and we found that she hadn't given us a beeper. She assured us we would get the next table, and we were seated within 5 minutes.  Always get the fried pickles here - they are great! They come with a semi-hot cream dip, which I think gets its heat from Sriracha; and a ranch dip. The pickles come directly out of the fryer and are always extremely hot. Sip on your drink for a couple while they cool down.  I ordered the King's Roll, it is my favorite at Cowfish. Once again it didn't disappoint. Stuffed with tuna, kani, jalapeno, cream cheese, and scallions; it's very lightly fried and then topped with crab salad, masago, hot and cream sauces. The pieces are huge, and I've found somewhat difficult to eat with chopsticks. So yes, I look like a noob eating it with my fork...but I'm happy with my King's Roll!   Highly recommended trying the Cowfish. If they tell you there's a wait, you can eat at the bar (first come, first served); if you prefer a table, make sure to get a beeper!  :)",

Cowfish bento box - this is a pretty good deal especially if you want to try everything. The sushi seemed fresh and the slider had good beef.  Creamsicle milkshake - this was the boyfriend's favorite, thick and creamy with a nice orange flavor.  Sidenote - they seem pretty dedicated to the \"cowfish\" theme.  Verdict - Prices were pretty high but the quality is there.",

You are paying for the idea of having a combination of burgers and sushi rather than quality food.  I have been here twice. The first time was decent, but nothing special. I wish that I could better describe the food, but that is just what it is: forgettable. The second time was terrible. A friend and I sat down at the bar, waited...and waited...and waited...and ended up leaving without ordering anything. Terrible service.  I would definitely check this place out once to see what it is all about, but that is just that. It's kind of like an accident that you see on the interstate. Sure, you may slow down a bit to see what happened, but you will never return to check it out twice. Meh.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, there was an amazing burger place right outside of SouthPark Mall: The Counter. This place was amazing, and when it closed I was devastated. Once it was replaced with The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, my grief quickly went away. The Cowfish is absolutely amazing. It's owned by the same people who own eeZ in Birkdale, and having dined there, I knew the food would be delicious &amp; inventive, and I was absolutely right. But then again, I'm always right =)  The Cowfish has the traditional style rolls (Philly, rainbow, etc) and a huge list of wildly inventive &amp; exotic rolls to choose from as well. When Graham &amp; I visited the day after Christmas, I wanted to try something different than I had ordered on previous visits. We decided on three (although I wanted about ten...), one from each section: the rainbow (a traditional roll), the blackened tuna (a more unique/fusion style roll) &amp; the Doug's Filet Roll (burgushi).  I'll start with the burgushi, because it's what makes The Cowfish stand out above other sushi restaurants (and Charlotte has a TON of them!). Burgushi is taking the elements of a burger and making it into a sushi roll, or taking the elements of a sushi roll and making it into a burger/sandwich.  This was amazing. It was a Philly roll, topped with a piece of seared filet mignon, spicy sauce, scallions & masago. Absolutely amazing. I could even look past the blob of cream cheese (which I HATE in sushi). The roll was enormous, but everything about it was perfect, I really loved the spicy sauce and the very mild flavor of the filet. This is definitely my favorite item on the \"burgushi\" part of the menu, so far.   The Rainbow Roll was, of course, my favorite. It was a California roll topped with assorted fish & spicy sauce. The fish was fresh & firm, the sauce was nice & didn't overpower the roll. I absolutely hate it when there is so much sauce you can't really taste anything else. I would have been more than happy to eat this all day.   The last roll we had was the blackened tuna: Lump crabcake mix & cream cheese inside, rolled in temoura flakes, topped with blackened tuna, guacamole & a slice of jalepeno.   While this roll was good, it didn't compare to the other two. The roll tasted dry & the slice of jalapeno was completely overpowering. However, the guacamole was a nice touch and absolutely delicious. I removed the jalapeno and added a different kind of heat with a little srirachia. It was a better flavor combination, in my opinion and I enjoyed the remaining pieces a lot more with this change.   Not only was the food excellent during our lunch time visit, but the service was excellent as well. Our server took the time to go over every single aspect of the menu, and gave us a recommendation out of each category. The Filet Roll was one of her suggestions, and I'm so glad we went with that.   My ONLY complaint here is that they are always busy, and they only take reservations from 11:00-6:00, which makes zero sense to me. Especially since most of the shops in the area (excluding the mall), close at 6:00 or 7:00. Lunch patrons can browse & shop while waiting for a table. Dinner patrons can not. I had wanted to eat here for our anniversary, but knew we would have to either wait forever or eat at the bar, so we changed our plans. We still had to wait, but 15 minutes isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things. Last time I went was on a Thursday night, and the wait was much, much longer so we ended up dining at the bar. Fine for a dinner with a friend, not as okay for an anniversary dinner with your husband. However, this place is worth the wait and I can not wait to go back on my next trip home.",

We were seated immediately and greeted by our friendly waitress moments after that.  She got our drink and app order of fried pickles.  The drinks were brought back within moments, the pickles followed soon after smoking hot.  As usual, I ate one too soon and burned my mouth.  When will I learn?  The fried coating on the pickle chips was crunchy and yum and the pickles were served with a side of ranch and Cowfish sauce (I dunno, it's orangeish and kinda spicy... it's good, have some).    For my meal I had Granny's Pimento Burger, cooked medium, with fries.  The fries at Cowfish are shoestring and they were served hot and crunchy, perfectly seasoned.  The burger was cooked to perfection and juicy.  Granny's is a burger served on toasted rye with pimento cheese, a fried green tomato, lettuce and Duke's mayo (if you are southern, you know the importance of Duke's being the mayo on your burger).  Delicious!  The juicy burger did soak through the bottom piece of bread, but I just turned that sucker upside down and kept eating.  Scrumdiddlyumptious as always!",

Very attentive staff. Got the blue cheese burger with fries and s California roll. Hit the spot! Very nice and clean bathrooms. Good beer and wine selection as well.",

We set at the bar on a crowed nite in front of a gigantic tropical aquarium filled with live coral moving about with beautiful tropical fish, sea urchins and starfish. Absolutely beautiful and unique. Our server at the bar was David who was very friendly and excellent at his job. Now for the food-I had the lamb burger which was very tasty and had a slice of fried feta on it which was real good. Husband had a cheddar burger which was cooked perfectly with a side of Thai cucumbers that were original and very good.  Overall nice experience and good food.",

    "text": "Felt like a lab rat... squeezing down two clogged lanes of rush hour traffic on 85, from Raleigh, and winding my way around the convoluted, impossible, multi-level, sprawling-across-intersections layout that is Southpark Mall. I finally called Cowfish to get a better bead on their location, and found them (eventually). The place was packed on my arrival, but they have quite a large horseshoe bar, and I was able to find a seat on the end.   The former Yelp CLT CM used to post Cowfish food porn pics, and they always looked awesome. And when I heard Cowfish was coming soon to Raleigh, I wanted to get a scoop on what to expect...  The idea of burger-sushi fusion is intriguing... but after my long drive, and looking over the burg-ushi, etc. options, I decided I wasn't feeling up to ordering something I might not enjoy. They have quite a long list of burgers and sushi rolls, which makes this restaurant concept kind of cool, because it's a place that will please anyone; it actually occurred to me I could take my non-sushi-eating parents there if I ever had a raw craving. I started with nigiri (white fish and yellowtail) and sake. Then followed that up with the Chef roll, which was large and tasty. All rolls can be made with brown rice for an extra fee.  Despite being busy, service was fast and attentive. The bar area has touch games built into the surface, which is neat-o. My biggest problem was the sticker shock. My drink, two pieces of nigiri, roll, and tip ran me ~$40, which is a lot to spend considering there's equally high-quality fish available for less where I live. Compelling concept, but not sure I'd be the one to suggest it, unless organizing a group get-together of varying palate preferences.",

I had the Ultimate Bento Box - with the Blackened Lobster Roll + the Boursin Burger.  -- Blackened Lobster Roll:  very interesting concept, having lobster crab cake in a sushi roll.  First couple pieces were good, but I got a little tired of it after a while.  I'd go for something closer to legit sushi next time to even out the flavor.    -- Boursin Burger:  the boursin cheese was awesome, and the burger was pretty good, but it was a little dry for my flavor.  -- Sides:  Soured cucumbers were good, but there was a little too much of it.  Sweet potato fries were good, but a little mushy.  And edamame was delicious, there's really no way to mess up edamame anyway.  -- Environment:  Is great, the decor around this place was very nice.  I loved their canvas'.  And their fish tank is amazing.  They actually have a longhorn cowfish in their tank!  -- Overall, I would recommend this place.  It's great to see urban fusion in Charlotte.  They're doing something no one else really is, and I would really support this.  I would recommend trying something else though.  The waitress told me to try the Bento Box, but if I were you, I'd either just go for the rolls or try the Burgushi.   Bento Box was good, but I wish I would've tried the Burgushi.",

    "text": "I got in the van thinking that my co-workers were headed to Mert's.  Lo and behold, we ended up at the South Park Mall and The Cowfish.  Parking was a cinch in the deck and we had a short walk to the restaurant.    We arrived around 1:00pm on a Friday and we had to wait roughly ten minutes for a table for six.  We were seated and handed our menus.  As has been previously noted, these menus are books.  You should allow yourself ten minutes just to read through the menu, as there is a lot to take in.  Our waitress came by to introduce herself and take our drink orders.  She asked if we had been to the restaurant before and when we replied that we hadn't, she walked us through the major sections of the menu.  Our drinks were brought out (including a quart glass milk-style bottle for water refills) and we placed our orders.  It was no more than fifteen minutes when all our plates were brought out.  I can only speak for the burger, but the CBCLT was quite good.  Served on a brioche bun (other bread options are available) with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and two types of cheddar, this is a solid burger.  The beef is all-natural, grass-fed which is something that I look for when I eat beef.  I had requested my burger be cooked medium, and for the most part it was.  The sweet potato fries on the side were tasty, but maybe just a tad above average.  The burger was served with their Cowfish Sauce, which I didn't quite care for.  But I loved that they had Sriracha Sauce in the lazy susan on the table.  Mixed some of that with some ketchup and had a spicy dip for my fries.  Good times.  This restaurant has a great vibe and a really eclectic burgers and sushi menu.  Prices may be a teensy bit high, but I think the food is worth it every once in a while.  Service was top-notch and personal.  And the men's bathroom had a scented candle!  Be sure to check out the book prints in the hallway on your way to the restroom.  They're pages from a children's book explaining the cowfish story.  I'll be back!",

C ordered the Chinese chicken salad, and while it was very good, a few of the ingredients were not the freshest.  She enjoyed it, and would get it again.  I should know better than to have sushi anywhere but an authentic Japanese restaurant, as this was very disappointing.  As soon as I saw the rice in the yellowtail hosomaki, I could tell it was not made properly.  Overcooked (with a mushy texture) is not how it is supposed to be done.  Though it may take five years to learn how to make perfect sushi rice, I have to think a restaurant of this caliber could produce something better than what I was served.  The yellowtail was just fair.  The spicy tuna hand roll was probably the weakest one I've ever had(!)  Large, clumsy chunks of grade B tuna, a bland sauce and limp cucumber strips.....I don't think so.  Well, maybe the burgers are better..",

    "text": "One of the most unique restaurants in the city - or really anywhere to be honest.  In the mood for burgers - they have great burgers...in the mood for sushi - they have great sushi...in the mood for filet mignon wrapped up like sushi - they have that too...in the mood for a sammie but craving sushi - well, they can do that too.  On top of that, they have awesome appetizers, great martini's and some every day type of salads, sammies and 'knife and fork' type of dishes.  The atmosphere is great - they actually have cowfish swimming in the fish tank - and don't miss going in to the bathroom - you'll get a very entertaining language lesson.  On the weekends, there is always a wait, but they take your cell phone number so you can go shopping at Crate and Barrel while you wait.  Go here...soon!  You will love it!",

Hidden near Crate &amp; Barrel, you'd miss it unless you knew it was there.  The same for all the shops near the area,  the parking is very limited...good luck!  Normally a sushi or burger joint is not my thing but I was open to trying something new so off we went.  Met up with a group prior to dinner time for a glass of wine so the restaurant was not busy. The bar and dining area is quite large though you wouldn't think so from the outside.  Once you enter, your eye can't help but look at the large aquarium.  Very nice!  The bar wraps around both dining rooms.  We were seated immediately, as they weren't busy.  And our first waiter quickly appeared to give us the full \"Cow Fish Menu experience.\"  He went over all the items on the menu, highlighting his favs, & the restaurant's best dishes.  Our second waiter was happy to recommend wines &amp; our third took our order.  Apparently, shift changes, sick staff caused us to have three waiters in less than 20 minutes...hmmmm  Our first two were very helpful &amp; attentive, the third unfortunately not.  We started with a little appetizer with our wine & if you know me, it was carbs!  So truffle fries were ordered & delivered quickly.  A large platter of house fries with truffle, melted parmesan cheeses, & chives...yum!    We ordered dinner while we munched on the appetizer & dinner arrived quickly...we didn't even finish our yummy fries.  The menu is eclectic from sushi burgers, sushi boxes, & burger salads.  I tried the The Screamin' Korean Chicken burger.  Unique burger with flash fried chicken breast topped with kimchi &amp; sriracha, ranch, &amp; Asian slow.  It was served with the burger usual's, lettuce, tomato, onions & pickles.   I added a little more sriracha to the sandwich, because everything is better with heat :)  and it wasn't bad.   While the burger was $11, you certainly get a large portion for your money &amp; that goes for all the dishes.  The other dishes were the same too.  Another entree that looked good ordered was the Cowfish Bento Box.  Literally served in an Asian box, you get a lot for your $12:  sliders, sweet fries, edamame, sushi rolls, & Thai cucumbers.   While I didn't try any of it, my friend certainly enjoyed.  And the shrimp dish was proportionally large  & apparently good as everyone shared, minus me of course.   The proportions were large, so no room for dessert this time.  Not to mention the restaurant did get very busy &amp; loud.  By 6, there was a line outside the door to get in.  Decor is interesting from large comically pictures all around the restaurant to the leather chairs, booths, Asian foods artwork.     For a unique experience & great ambience, definitely give it a try.",

    "text": "There are better places to get sushi in Charlotte and likewise with the burgers. The 'something for everyone concept' works and I like the decor so I give it 3 stars because when the food is warm, timely and well cooked it's a nice place to have a drink, grab a burger and shake or some americanized sushi.  However, the problem with Cowfish is that they are consistently off the mark, whether its one thing or a combination of things I list some of the negatives in the half dozen times we've visited: cold burgers, cold fries, bad sushi, slow service, rude service, over cooked food, long hair in a burger, wrong orders... need I go on. After giving this place multiple chances to put right any 'newly opened' glitches, my friends and I have given up and stopped visiting. That's a shame because we all live within walking distance and used to visit a lot.  The place is always very busy so I hope for the sake of the southpark village area businesses and residents that other patrons are not experiencing what we have.",

The service is always great here too. It gets SUPER busy on the weekends but honestly, it is worth the wait, especially if you have some drinks at the bar. My favorites from the menu are the Ahi Tuna Nachos, the fried pickles, the crab rangoon dip, \"THE BOSS\" roll, and the make your own sushi - I love that they offer brown rice for sushi as well (so much better for you than white). If you want to try something new/amazing - try the Taste Explosion roll - OH MY GOD! Love this place.",

And so knowing that I love sushi but my other half does not, he knew this would be a great place for us to visit.  Well needless to say we did love and fell in love. This is definitely our go to spot when someone comes in town, for a birthday or holiday or whatever.   The food is always fresh and very well seasoned. The service is always impeccable and that definitely goes a long way.   The menu is vast and they have many options and I am very impressed with their kid menu. My son loves cowfish too and for us to have a nice family restaurant that we all really love is not an easy task.  And I am very happy to report that Cowfish turned my non-sushi eating man into a sushi lover.   It is typically quite busy and the wait was always long but on our last visit, there was absolutely no wait time.",

The other couple with us was able to check in on their app which helped some but you have to be within a certain distance from the spot to do it.  When we arrived around 5:30 on Saturday there was an hour wait even with checking in on the app.  OK, I don't mind of the sushi is awesome.  We had a crab dip app at the bar and waited it out.  Our server, Jamal was really good.  Funny, attentive and knew the menu well so there's that.  The sushi was really good.  I had the two time roll and it was excellent I had one more but can't remember the name.  The selection on the menu was varied and included burgers, bento boxes, sushi and the \"burgushi\".  It's the kind of place you want to keep coming back to try different things so we'll get back here eventually.  The food was solid, experience was good except for the wait so the only thing I could suggest is them allowing you to make reservations but the way they're doing it now hasn't hurt business any so rock on, Cowfish!",

I consumed the thing in 2 minutes because if I didn't, I had family and friends there with me eyeing my plate as of it were there last supper.

    "text": "So I've been coming here for 2 years.  There was another review posted by my sister, that post was from 2 years ago since we started coming here.   Prices have changed ( we all understand prices go up ) but if you're prices are going to go up, make sure your product remains the same or make it even better.  Burgers have become a joke , each time I come, they get smaller and smaller.  Don't get me wrong , the flavor is good still, but, as a business owner myself...if I raise my prices, it's because I'm offering something even better or remain the same product at least.  After coming here every other weekend for the last 2 years, I WILL NOT VISIT THIS PLACE.  Time to find another favorite place",

It's a fun and delicious experience which I highly recommend.",

    "text": "I had huge expectation for this place after reading all of the other positive reviews with this place.  I wanted to love their food so badly but I just couldn't trick my taste buds.  I got a taste explosion roll and my friend got a bento box. After stuffing an entire piece of the roll into my mouth, I thought I loved it. It was a fabulous confusing mixture of sushi and a burger swimming about. Then as I had my second and third roll I couldn't lie to myself anymore. The concoction of a burger with sushi had an overwhelming conflicting taste that just did not work together. I did not despise the roll but it just did not meet my expectation. I am sure there is some way you can befriend the flavors of sushi and burgers but this was not it. As for the bento box, there was nothing too special other than seeing sweet potato fries and edamame served as a side next to each other.   Asides from the food, the restaurant had a great vibe. Red and black decor with this sweet fish tank. PLEASE NOTE THE FISH TANK! I saw nemo, dori, and some other characters from finding nemo and then this fugly looking fish. As I was waiting for my food, I decided to look up where the name originated from and to my surprise, I saw a COWFISH! I do not see the cow resemblance with the fish but they had a cowfish swimming in their tank! Props. So... this place is definitely worth going to to experience the bizarre food with Andrew Zimmern but I personally did not love the food. (the mojito was delish tho)  Concluding Haiku:  Give the Cow' a lick Funky fish too burgerish Give the Fish' a lick",

I haven't had a bad roll here, though the downside to that is that their menu seems to be a little too long. A couple of their burgers were a little greasy, but overall I've had good burgers here.   If you are adventurous, make sure you try the burgersushi, they are very inventive & flavorful. They do make the classics if you are not so adventurous, but then again... if you like sushi you probably are willing to try something outside of the ordinary ;-)",

One of the dinner options is a bento box that comes with sweet potato fries, edamame, a slider, cucumber salad, and 4 pieces of some sushi roll. My only compliant is that the burger that came with the box was tiny. Hard to keep a burger super juicy when it's that small. Wasn't bad, but didn't really satisfy the urge for a burger. Otherwise, large portions.  Next time, I'd go one way or the other... Sushi or burger.   Patient staff with some high maintenance customers.",

The sushi is mediocre tasting, lacking flavour and fish! I could barely taste the salmon. On my first visit I had tried the bento box and it was less than memorable. The burger portion was tasty , but it was the size of a slider and the sushi part was bland. I suspect if a patron sticks to their burgers they will leave happy and full.

(I'm not a sushi person, but people come here for that as well) And I have to say that the burgers were a nice size for the price. I was able to get fried pickles as a side and that was amazing!  We also had awesome service too. Two thumbs up for this place!",

It was overall a good experience and I enjoyed my food and received good service as a solo diner at the bar. The sushi was good but not memorable. I just felt that I could have gotten sushi and drinks of equal quality and service at another, less expensive restaurant. I suppose it a place to be seen and maybe my expectations were too high.

    "text": "Purists of both the sushi and burger variety are sure to frown on a restaurant that combines two seemingly disparate menu items, but for the rest of us, Cow fish is top notch!   The well-decorated restaurant offers a full menu's worth of burgers as well as a solid sushi menu with both traditional items (such as tuna rolls and single slice nigiri) but also offers the more \"fusion\" style rolls which include things like red meat, veggies and fried rolls.   While I wanted this to be a 5-star restaurant, the service was not quite good enough to put it over the top.   The staff while friendly, bungled a couple of our orders, and could have been a bit more attentive.   Even so, the charm of the menu, the building and the staff makes it a \"must\" for anyone in the Charlotte area.",

    "text": "We're regulars at this place and it's our favorite sushi restaurant.    We always start off with edamame, which can be prepared with 4 different flavorings, (e.g., cajun, sea salt, etc.).  I used to always get the seared sesame tuna salad which is served over a seaweed and cucumber salad with sesame seeds and sriracha (love) but lately I've been getting the tuna nicoise salad, which is huge and has a lot of tuna.  For other apps, the blackened ahi tuna nachos and avacado and tuna tini are also great.    For sushi, I love the southpark roll but I usually do the \"make your own roll\" - you can use cucumber as the outer roll if you don't like the seaweed wrap or want to go healthy and avoid rice.    John, the manager, is such a quality guy and always has taken good care of us.  Our kids love it here as much as we do; they usually get the bento boxes, which have a ton of food so if you want some fries/sweet potato fries, you can just eat your kid's because they'll never eat them all.  Great dirty martinis here also (I've liked all the 'tini drinks I've had here).",
