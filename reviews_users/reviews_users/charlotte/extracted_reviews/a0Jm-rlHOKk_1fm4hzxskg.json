    "text": "The menu selection is HUGE... sharing of entrees among table guests is encouraged so everyone gets to sample a variety of menu offerings if dining in a group. I found 4 of 5 entrees to be quite good (& one was ok, just not my taste).  However, Wan Fu does not offer EGG ROLLS nor EGG DROP SOUP. I have had spring rolls several places, but I found Wan Fu's spring rolls to be a bit \"mushy\" on the palate and \"egg-roll\" like in size compared to thinner longer spring rolls served at other places I've been.  The restaurant is a good place to celebrate a birthday... free dessert with candles and song. Seems to be a place enjoyed by children (& families). A good sign when Asians dine at a Chinese restaurant.",

Front desk staff was rude and unapologetic  about the delays they were experiencing  in bringing out the food. I had placed a takeout order and was told it would be ready in 20 to 30 minutes. Got there and waited another hour before they got me the food. They had no idea how long it would take. On checking on the status, I was rudely told your food is not here. When it comes we will call out your name.",

There was an hour long wait, which, though we were not thrilled with, we took to be a good sign.  That said - We were somewhat disappointed with this restaurant. The decor is interesting but a bit dated.  The food was simply not up to the prices that are being charged.  The Moo Shu pork was pretty bland with only 4 wrappers and two tablespoons of plum sauce.  The dumplings were decent but a bit overcooked.  The hot & sour soup tasted like a mix though it had plenty of mushrooms and chicken. The jasmine tea didn't taste like anything resembling jasmine.  In fact, we asked the waitress if they had made a mistake and she said that they only had jasmine tea - no other choice.  On a $50 meal for 2 people I was just looking for better quality.  Could it have been an off night because of the volume of people - possibly.  Still, there are much better Chinese restaurants for the money in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I have been a long time customer of Wan Fu over the last 10 years and I must say last nights experience was pretty bad.  Christmas Eve, I get it that it's going to be busy and as usual I called for a reservation because it's the polite thing to do and I hate waiting. I called a bit late and they only had 4 pm open.  Me and my party got there at 4 which turned out to be their opening time.  I was greeted by the Manager who is always there.  He was nice as always and we were promptly seated.  Table of 6 which included a booth for 4 and a table set alongside.  A little uncomfortable but no problem.  The server who waited on us has been there for quite a while and has waited on us in the past.  We ordered an appetizer for the table of lettuce wraps and she basically told us that because of it being Christmas Eve the appetizers were going to come out with our entree.  She explained it in her broken English and I thought she meant that the kids meals would come out with the appetizers which is what I wanted anyway since my kids take like 10 years to eat a meal.    Our lettuce wraps show up and so do about 10 other plates which included our entrees, rice, kids meals.  You couldn't see the table there was so much food. My # 1 pet Peeve at a restaurant when they cannot time the food properly enough to give you time to enjoy the food. I was pissed!  Chinese food doesn't take that long to cook and it was like a race for us to spend our money and get the heck out of there.  So, I and the rest of my party scarfed down our food and before I knew it while the pit was forming in my pre Christmas Day stomach the check was handed to us and we were basically being shown the door so they could get the next party in.  I told the Manager about the experience and he explained that it was because of the \"circumstances of the evening\".  It was 4:00 and they were not busy at the time and I, being a long term customer don't appreciate being hurried when there was no reason to do so, except for the fact that you can't manage your kitchen.  If you can't handle it, don't open the effin restaurant.    Wan Fu better open their eyes up to the reality that there are other options out there and you don't get repeat business, especially from long term customers by providing them crappy service.  I don't care how good your food is.  Goodbye Wan Fu......",

However, they were very much professional and polite after a bit of a wait on Saturday evening, which is to be expected now.  The funny thing my wife noted was, never has she seen an Asian restaurant be so slow.  Coming from NYC, we are used to waitstaff coming before you're even ready to order and almost pushing you out of your seat to let the next group of diners in!  It must be the south.. We waited over 5 minutes before someone even offered to take our drink orders and so we went ahead and ordered food to not risk another wait before she takes our food order.  Plus, go ahead and ask for your check in advance since they seem to batch all the checks and you'll wait for that as well.  On the positive, the food was delicious, definitely worth it for the portions, but I think I would come back more often if it was a dollar or two less per dish.  We had the General Tao and Basa Fish with Basil Leaf and brown rice.  Very tasty and we had to force ourselves to stop eating, so we only saved enough for one serving of leftovers the next day. The brown rice was also nicely cooked, not too soft and not too hard.  I didn't like the Velvet Corn and Chicken Soup.  It was like an egg drop soup with little bits of chicken and corn, not substantial enough for the price.  Overall 4 stars, but speed of service would be 2.5 stars.",

    "text": "I just visited today and had to update my rating. They get bumped up to 5 stars.  I'm recovering from some oral surgery and figured Chinese would be a good soft option for lunch today.  Plus I was craving hot and sour soup.  The staff is wonderful here, friendly, attentive and they don't frown on my special request of \"no rice\".  Like who besides me goes to asian restaurants and doesn't order rice?  Anyway, today I had the Garlic Chicken without the rice and hot and sour soup.  The hot and sour soup was just that - hot in temperature and spice level and a wonderful flavor that I savored as long as I could.  The garlic chicken came out and the chicken and veggies (peppers, broccoli,onions, water chestnuts) were all tender in a very savory but not overpowering sauce with just a little kick to it.    Many chinese restaurants don't do spicy dishes well but Wan Fu hits it just right.  In fact, everything is perfect here...the decor, the soft music playing, the lighting. the staff, the prices.    Oh yeah, I'm a fan!",

I came here at the recommendation of a Chinese coworker who recommended this as one of only two restaurants she considers to have quality Chinese food (the other was the restaurant in Grand Asia Market which is recommended for the most authentic Chinese cuisine experience).  I came on a Saturday night to place a to go order (good thing I didn't heave my heart set on dining in; it was a 40 minute wait!). The interior was marvelous - very classy dining area with curtains, red tablecloth, and the lanterns. I'd ordered the gai lan (Chinese broccoli) with garlic sauce (their menu indicated spicy but I was actually informed not really; they gave me some extra chili sauce though) and a side of vegetable rolls covered in a peanut sauce. The quality of this place is definitely a step above the normal Chinese fare that Charlotte offers (their website boasts not using MSG or trans fat oils), and I wasn't waiting too long for my food either. Worth the trip and cannot wait to go back!",

They've changed something in how they make both the pork and veggie dumplings - they're folded differently and the dough is awful!  I hope they get their mojo back soon..",

Wan Fu has changed their menu radically. It used to be akin to a small novel,  now it's a two sided laminated board.  We sat down and ordered the Szechuan wonton with peanut/chili oil sauce, a spring roll , hot & sour soup & pork fried dumplings to start. All our choices were excellent!  For our main courses my wife had the tangerine beef and I ordered Sa cha beef & scallops. She said that her beef was excellent and very flavorful. The kitchen apparently forgot my scallops. A manager was checking on tables and offered to re - make the dish for me. I thought that was very thoughtful but we were nearly done eating so the price of the dish was lowered to reflect beef only. He gave me a coupon for $15 off our next visit with a purchase of $50 worth of food!  That was extremely nice of him. Of course we'll be back.",

After a long day at Carolina Place Mall which is very close, my Yelp app said \"go to Wan Fu, you genius\". I obeyed. The exterior is very grand with a heavy wooden door guarded by limestone lions.  The host/owner was very warm and friendly. The frostyTiger beer from Singapore was even more friendly. To start: Cold Sesamee Noodles with Peanut Sauce 3/5 Stars - too heavy on the peanut sauce - tasted almost like peanut butter - you really need to stir it up well before serving. Tastes better the second day when it's refrigerator cold. Pan Fried Dumplings 4/5 Stars - really nice filling, the wrappers were a little thick and doughy for my tastes. One of our waiters suggested the entrees we ended up ordering. Szechuan Beef - spicy, savory with a little sweet and sour - they added broccoli at no additional charge. Wan Fu Scallops - spiced and seared, served with vegetables. Both were really good but the beef was better, hands down; 4/5 Stars. My fortune cookie: Confucius says \"look behind you, it's Elvis!\" And when I turned back around, the food was boxed and dishes gone.The staff was a well chorographed team that kept food coming and old dishes cleared. Best hot Chinese tea I've had in ages!! Also, be prepared to eat leftovers for days as the portions are big!!",

It also tasted very good especially the lo mein. However, the first time I came back here, my tummy felt a little queasy after eating the food. I thought it might have to do with something else and not the food here, but then I came here a second time. I ended up having very bad food poisoning the second time and I'm positive it's because of the food here. I have no idea what their sanitary rating is but God I am never coming back here.",

    "text": "So many things wrong with this place. First, it's owned by a Vietnamese lady and her husband from Guam. They bought it from Mr. Lee, the original owner. Nothing wrong with that. But it's not truly authentic Chinese food. They don't even know what Wan Fu means. It means 10,000 fortunes.   2nd. They reuse sauces and other things. If you order anything with a sauce and don't finish said sauce, it will be recycled for the next customer, etc Chinese mustard, duck sauce, hot oil. If you order pineapple fried rice, it comes in a half of pineapple shell. The half of the pineapple is used at least 5 times before they discard. I'm pretty sure that's a health code violation right there! You may be asking how do I know? I used to work there. I was told not to throw away sauces or pineapple halves.   3rd. They're also violating NC labor laws. They'll pay $10.00 for a half day on the first day, which is from 5 to 11. NO TIPS. They'll say it's a trial day. Then they pay you 10% of your earned tips up to 100%, depending on how hard the boss lady thinks you work. I got up to 60% in 2 months. Dare I ask where did the other 40% go to? I've worked at TGI Fridays and many sushi restaurants and NONE has this pay structure. I worked hard but they never gave me what I deserved. I lost 8 pounds cleaning tables and sweeping the floor under the table after EACH table left. I never made over $60 a night! Well never \"got\" because 40% of my tips were stolen! One day, I was at the server station, where they posted a giant poster from the NC Labor department. I was reading it. It said restaurants have to pay 85% of tips earned or minimum wage an hour. I was getting neither. No other server could understand that poster due to their lack of English. I'm a college graduate. I merely found myself in a financially difficult situation at the time. I wanted to get cash every day, WHILE staying legal. Thus I  confronted the Vietnamese lady boss with this information. She said you want cash tips every day or you want me to pay $7.25 an hour and you get your money ONCE a month? With a smirk. I was helpless because at the time my financial situation was rough. I accepted 60% cash tip of what I really earned because it was fast. She wasn't even aware that NC law allows resturants to keep 15% of server tips. So she lied and said \"IF YOU WANT TO WORK UP TO 85% OF TIPS.\" Whereas before she said you have to work hard to get 100% of tips. Tips come out of pocket from customers so they didn't EVEN pay me minimum wage. I promptly quit and never looked back. I AM STILL CONSIDERING TO GO TO NC LABOR DEPARTMENT. So if you are a customer, you're supporting this. Stop going there, please!!!!!  You may also think, this guy only has 1 review, maybe its a fake review from their competitor. WELL I can tell you that I worked there in 2013 after my business died. I was taken advantage of. The guy manger was surprised I spoke fluent English. I've wanted to write a review for so long but didn't due to fear of physical retribution. (Vietnamese Mafia). Oh. the owners also SMOKES AND DRINKS AT THE BAR after closing. BUT Trump won the election and no one can live in fear for the rest of their lives. I've told all my friends not to go there unless you want to get food poisoning. Check some other reviewers about that!  PS. Don't think that it has changed. My friend went there to work. I told him the experience. He said he didn't care because he never had server experience and was prepared to be taken advantage of for training. He confirmed he was paid $10.00 for 6 hours of work on his 1st day. This was in 2014. NO TIPS. He ended up quitting and making $150 a night at a sushi restaurant. And to the reviewer that doubts I'm a college graduate, contact me. I'll show you my degree. No doubt I'm working in a large corporate company now, using my degree.",

Took a little longer that expected to get the food, but was prepared well once we got it.  The second visit was not as good unfortunately.  The food was mediocre at best.  The waiter asked where we were from, when we told them we were from New York, he commented that the food was probably not as good as what we usually get in New York.  While that may be True to some extent, that doesn't explain why the food would come out luke warm and the rice under cooked.  It's rice!",

Well on the way home from Wan Fu my wife and I went over every aspect of the meal to see if we could find a flaw and we couldn't.   For starters the building is quite impressive from the outside, and inside the decorations seemed very tasteful and the whole place had an \"old school\" Chinese restaurant feel even down to the music. I grew up in Charlotte and am old enough to remember The Dragon Inn, The Oriental, Ding Haw, and Ho Toy, and had, for some reason, recently been missing that style of sit-down, full-service Chinese restaurant.   Thanks to all the \"Yelpers\" that recommended Wan Fu  The appetizer was a spectacular start. We had the pan fried dumplings. Obviously house made, they were plump little purses of very flavorful and tender pork filling. The wrappers were so tender and good that I considered getting a second order.  Entrees were seafood chow-fun and tangerine beef. Neither disappointed. The shrimp and scallops in the chow-fun were big, plentiful and perfectly cooked, still plump with a nice sear. Noodles were nice and wide and so flavorful. Even the bean sprouts were great, they obviously use top quality fresh ingredients. The tangerine beef was even better, crispy, perfectly cooked small slices of beef in the most heavenly flavorful sauce you can imagine. My wife is from NY and said that this is the best tangerine beef she had ever had. Spice level was perfect, not even the broccoli and carrots were left on the plate.   prices were not bad for what we ate, and the little plate of fortune cookie, almond cookie and orange wedge that came with the check was a nice touch.  We will be back for sure, I can't wait to try the hot and sour soup",

    "text": "Wan Fu is probably at the top of my list when I think of Chinese food.  You can't help to get excited when you see the oriental inspired architecture on the building.  The interior is accented well with decorations.  There is a small bar in the lobby if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table.  However, there is normally not much of a wait.    The food is a little on the expensive side for a Chinese restaurant but it is worth it, in my opinion.  If you go there for lunch the food will be a little cheaper but you will be served lunch portions.  You can do to-go here and you do not even have to go inside.  There is a drive-through window in the back.  I have never used the drive-through window but I am sure you have to call it in first.    The cold noodles appetizer with peanut sauce is well portioned and comes with bean sprouts.  I am a sucker for bean sprouts.  However, The thing that makes this Chinese restaurant unique and stand out from the rest is that there are a few plates here that they will bring out on a sizzling plate.  I got the sizzling beef and my fiance got the surf and turf, both of which come on a sizzling plate.  The sizzling beef comes with mushrooms and a brown sauce and the surf and turf comes with mixed vegetables.  The thing about the sizzling plates is that the sauce will boil on the plate and concentrate into a delicious paste.  We both ordered brown rice which they brought out in a covered bowl for us to share.  If you want to keep a low profile at this restaurant do not order the sizzling plates because everyone will be looking at you wishing they had ordered that.  Next time I will try something else but it is definitely worth the experience to get.    WanFunderful.",

First thing we noticed was that the service was really friendly and attentive. We went for the Kung Pao chicken and the Bang Bang Shrimp.  I really liked the chicken, you could tell that all ingredients were fresh and the chicken was plentyful. The shrimp were also nice, came in a curry sauce that I personally wouldn't necessarily associate with Chinese food. But it was good.  We didn't care for the spring rolls. Found them to be too bland and not a lot of filling. But then again: can't remember the last time I had a really good spring roll...  We'll be back!",

We were the first folks in the door for dinner (on the weekends they're closed 3-4p between services).  It's a very clean restaurant with three separate dining rooms to make it feel much more warm & intimate than the windowless exterior may imply. The menu's huge with most dinner prices falling between $11.95 - $15.95. Certainly something for everyone.  While portion sizes were above-average, I wasn't blown away by the quality of any of the four entrees we ordered. Singapore Rice Noodles with Shrimp & Chicken was the profile I expected and not something you can get at any Asian joint. The spice was particularly strong in a couple of spots and non-existant in others, so the sauce wasn't consistent. Wife's Hunan Chicken was General Tso's with a slightly sweeter sauce, and the Beef w/ Mixed Veg was what you'd expect.  Only bad part of the meal was Seafood Lo Mein. The scallops tasted like some combination of frozen, overcooked, and leftover. The shrimp in two of our dishes was fine, but those scallops left the literal bad taste in my mouth.  They were very accommodating for our infant son; probably not the best place to bring a small kid at the height of dinner, but a lunch or early dinner worked out just fine.  We'd consider going back but, personally, we'd likely choose going to Taipei South just down the road on McMullen Creek Dr 9/10 times... slightly smaller portion and a little less variety but also half the $.",

Inside is a dimly lit, very clean dining area with many tables and rooms.  The food was phenomenal and the servings, enormous.  I ordered shrimp lo mein with a vegetable spring roll.  The spring rolls were tasty and fresh, but my lo mein entree was out of this world.  The shrimp were succulent, tender and perfectly spiced and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  This was the best lo mein I've had in recent memory.  My lunch was reasonable, totaling about $10.  The service was excellent; everyone there was personable.

For some reason, my parents and I began eating Chinese food every Saturday night somewhere around 12 years of age and I've kept eating Chinese food at least once a week since then.    Hands down, this is some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten!  And I've eaten Chinese food in Toronto, San Francisco, New York, and Philly - in Little China areas, nonetheless.  What makes WanFu the best?  The veggies always seem really fresh and the selection is different than what you'll see anywhere else.  For example, the WonTon soup has some fresh spinach leaves in it.  Have you ever seen that done anywhere?  I haven't, but the flavor it imparts is impeccable.  Vegetable fried rice includes big pieces of fresh red pepper, yellow squash, and asparagus.  And while some of the other dishes can be oversauced, the fried rice has a lot less sauce than any other place...and that allows the incredible flavor of these fresh veggies to glide delectably over your tastebuds.  It is a little more expensive than your typical Chinese restaurant, but it's worth it!",

This is actually the first decent Chinese restaurant we have visited since moving here 7 months ago. Decor is elegant, service was excellent as well. Parking is plentiful and location is great. We will definitely be back for more soon.",

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a sweet woman, who assisted me with my take-out order for lunch.  I ordered plain lo mein with water chestnuts, so a plus that they have water chestnuts.  I also ordered extra sauce, which they accommodated nicely.  A lot of times, for some reason, it is hard to get extra sauce.  They do not have eggrolls and on this day, I REALLY wanted an eggroll.  But that's ok, I survived. They have spring rolls that I've heard are delicious, just not my thing.  My lo mein was very good.  I had chili hot sauce to go with it, which I enjoyed.  Overall a pretty good experience.  A very quick order for lunchtime goodness.",

On a recent trip I found out they will try to make a menu accommodation if you ask (in this case, someone said they wished they had sesame scallops and the waiter told her they could do that, and they did). Personal favorites are their sesame beef (the best I've had anywhere, hands down), shrimp and scallops, honey chicken, and sesame tofu. Strongly recommend.",

Wan Fu has great reviews on Yelp so I was looking forward to some good Chinese food, which has proven difficult to find in Charlotte in my 10 years here.  My barometer for comparing Chinese takeout is tofu with vegetables in a brown sauce.  It allows me to judge how well a restaurant can stir fry vegetables, which is more difficult than stir frying only chicken, such as General Tso's.    Wan Fu's tofu with mixed vegetables in brown sauce was very disappointing.  The tofu was great (it's hard to mess up fried tofu), but the vegetables included yellow squash and baby carrots that were way over cooked and thus limp and mushy.  The sauce was watery, as if some of the vegetables were frozen.  There wasn't much taste to discern in the sauce other than bitterness.  For $11 for a basic tofu dish, Wan Fu isn't worth the visit.",

The two of us arrived and had to wait quite a bit as it was busy.    We were finally seated in an area with plenty of open tables.  The hostess took our drink order, then we waited and waited for the server to come take our food order.  After that was taken, our food came out very quickly!  We started with the steak skewers appetizer.  That was fun to cook and it was very tasty! Then our main entrees came, I got the Sesame chicken and Kevin got the Hunan chicken.  Mine was okay, not the best sesame chicken I've had and Kevin's chicken was just okay as well.  The broccoli in his dish was amazing as it soaked up the flavor so well!  Don't get me wrong, the food had good flavor and you get good portion sizes, but I wasn't wowed and I've had better.  After we finished, we waited and waited and waited for our server to finally box up our food and bring us our check.  Their servers are really slacking and I think that is because they are trying to have them do too much.  I saw my server in the bar area while we were waiting to be seated, saw her answering phones to take orders, then of course being a server.  It is fine if you want to give your servers multiple tasks, but give them 3-4 tables only, not 10.  There are other places with better food and better services that we will not be back.",

I didn't have to slow my pace after entering the front door, since I was immediately led to a booth to be seated. The gentleman who took me to my table was very polite and friendly.   My bookmark for Wan Fu said, \"spicy beef with broccoli, dumplings, and Tiger beer.\" I didn't order any of those. What struck my fancy for lunch was spicy Hunan pork with vegetables and white rice, which has become one of my favorite go to Chinese menu items.   As I was waiting for my food to be prepared people started to arrive. It was easy to see that there were many regulars. The gentleman who seated me was familiar with each diner, and he knew their favorite orders in advance.   My food took about fifteen minutes to arrive. It was brought by what I assumed what the chef, who was a distinguished and competent looking, well dressed Chinese gentleman in his late fifties. A chef has to be proud of their food skills and presentation to personally bring the dish to the table.   The food was as beautifully plated as shown in the photos on Yelp. I expected the chef to be talented and competent, and that proved to be the case.   There was a generous amount of sliced pork in the dish. The mushrooms, carrots, and broccoli were perfectly prepared, and not cooked to death. The white rice was also on point.   A small vegetable roll was provided with the meal, and it was crispy and delicious. It was served with Chinese sweet and sour sauce or .   The sweet iced tea was unlike any sweet tea that I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. This was primarily because it wasn't too sweet, and secondly, it didn't have the jasmine flavor of other Americanized Chinese restaurants. Other diners were ordering their iced tea \"half & half\" to circumvent the southern sweet tea stigma of diabetes in a glass, but it wasn't necessary at Wan Fu.   My impressions of the food and the restaurant?  Wan Fu was simply and tastefully decorated, not over the top like some Chinese restaurants that I've experienced in San Francisco and New York. The napkins were linen.   ALL of the employees were super friendly, courteous, and attentive. Service was definitely five stars. When the waitstaff was tied up with customers, the chef/owner? came out of the kitchen to seat diners and to inquire whether refills were needed. That's above and beyond in my book.   Spicy Hunan Pork? The dish was good, but it didn't WOW me. The dish was definitely Americanized, and watered down to the stereotypical American wimpy taste buds. It wasn't the least bit spicy. I remedied that by requesting hot chili oil, which was expeditiously brought to my table. This improved the taste tremendously. If you like your food on the hot and spicy side, follow my example. Life is better with hot chili oil.   My bill was: $8.25 for the Hunan Pork + $1.95 for the iced tea + $.85 for tax = $11.05. I left a 30% tip, because I was impressed by every facet of the restaurant.  My only reservation would be their cleanliness rating, which has fluctuated between a low A at 91.0% to their current 95%. I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to be closer to a 100% sanitation rating. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.cdpehs.com%2FNCENVPBL%2FINSPECTION%2FShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx%3FESTABLISHMENT%3D127442%26esttst_cty%3D60&s=797200445a1463050525d9cd7739238b98bb48d3e5d1210167fe63b8b1ebf6c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">public.cdpehs.com/NCENVP...</a>  I recommend Wan Fu, and I would certainly return without hesitation. Maybe next time I'll actually order what I bookmarked to try.",

    "text": "The best Chinese in Charlotte is actually in Pineville. Wan fu is that place. There is a reason it has been around for so many years. It stays busy as well. Szechuan wontons are perfectly balanced, sweet spicy peanut sauce. The sweet and sour chicken is very good as is the general Tao chicken.  Garlic chicken/shrimp and the firecracker shrimp are some other favorites. We frequent here as much as possible. It is a few dollars more than your strip mall Chinese restaurant, but well worth it.  The lunch specials are good deals, they come with a spring roll and are significantly cheaper than the dinner prices. These specials are available on weekends as well.  The spring rolls are the best I've found in Charlotte.",

I've never had raw, peeled baby carrots (like what you buy at the grocery store) served with my Chinese food. They whole experience was just MEH.

We were sat promptly.  The menus is large and has so many unique choices I was having trouble selecting an order. The waiter came over and told us any of the dishes could be made exactly how we wanted and suggested a few things.  On his suggestion I got chicken with cashew with garlic sauce ! I love chicken with cashew but never had the garlic sauce! Oh wow that dish was amazing!! This place is clean and the staff are really nice !!  Don't pay attention to the pictures of the food on the menu it doesn't do it justice! It was fresh and delicious ! Also I got a Buddha beer it was unique and good. Ask the wait staff for suggestions they were so helpful!",

I enjoyed the decor; it was very cozy and inviting.  You can tell most of the staff have probably worked there for quite some time and I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely caring the staff is as a group.  Some are not the most warm and friendly but all of them were very courteous, attentive, and hardworking.  Our server and the manager (owner?) both checked in on us during the meal and almost everything was really good.  I wouldn't recommend the Szechuan chicken wontons.  The sauce was a bit bland and the dumplings didn't seem super freshly-cooked.  Other than that, our meals were very tasty.  I especially loved the San Bei chicken hot pot.  So delicious!  We were watching the other tables' dishes come out and so many were impressive.  Huge servings of beautifully-plated fish, noodles, soups, and other tempting entrees.  We really enjoyed our time there and will definitely be back.",

My order was ready within 15 minutes.  The lunch menu is a great value..  I got Kung Pao chicken ($8.25) with brown rice. They will sub the brown rice instead of white rice at no additional charge. Also, the lunch entree comes with a veggie spring roll. However if you ask for spring roll with shrimp & chicken, they don't up charge for that either.  They use fresh veggies and good cuts of chicken unlike most places in those strip shopping centers. Also, I never have that icky feeling I get when I eat at a place that uses too much MSG in their food.  Wan Fu, keep doing what you're doing and you will remain my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!",

I really like the fact that they serve excellent brown rice which is really helpful with many diet restrictions and also offer low sodium soy sauce. I consider this to be a higher end Chinese restaurant not super expensive but higher that basic carry out places but the food quality, great service and atmosphere is well worth the little bit of a price increase I can assure you. There hot tea is excellent and the have a small bar but a nice drink selection both beer and mixed drinks which are prepared nicely. The bar is also in the waiting area which is nice because you can enjoy a drink if it's busy and set down and chat while wait. Also many years ago when my oldest child was young and my ex wife was pregnant they were super busy and had no chairs and they went upstairs to the dinning hall and brought them chairs down to sit on while we waited so the staff has respect for their customers and that is proof in my book. I can say I'm the hundreds of times I've eaten for corporate functions, lunch and dinner I have never once had a bad meal here and I wish I still lived closer or they had a location in north Charlotte.",

Recently we tried booking this place for Father's Day to which they made us put $400 down for a deposit but when we told them we could no longer reserve that day, they refused to give us our money back.   $400 for no service and lost our business forever. I don't recommend this place as they only care about the money and aren't friendly or understanding. Their food was never really that good anyways.",

    "text": "People recommended this place as this one has been running the business for more than 10 years here. It is the best if you are with a group of people to order and share diverse dishes for Chinese food.   4 of us ordered steak and shrimp with asparagus, general tso chicken, emperor shrimp and eggplant with garlic sauce. You can't go wrong with general tso in most of chinese restaurants. I specially liked emperor shrimp and garlic egg plant. The crispy shrimp and creamy sauce goes well together and eggplant was so tasty! Steak and shrimp was good but steak could be more tender.   Overall, the food was great but the portion of each dish was not big enough. It will be better to order 4 main dishes and extra vegetable dish next time. Both service and food were great!",

Went the other day, just a weekday night, early and hardly anyone in there. Ordered Pot Stickers, Not good, very old meat tasting? Asked for Chili sauce and it tasted off. Had the Sa Cha Chicken, Beef and Shrimp. It came out very quickly and it was  hot but not much of any flavor. Only four shrimp, lots of celery and snow peas. I was really disappointed. I am hoping this was just an off night. Service was great and I still like the atmosphere but food was just disappointing to me,",

Not only was the food just friggin awesome, we ordered two of the same dishes and this place evidences a key tenet...consistency!  Omg, General Tao (5/5) is just straight up the best I have had, no gelatinous sauce and fried to perfection!  The fried rice with shrimp (5/5) makes yours eyes water it's so damn good!  It's not salty or heavy or oily in an over the top way;  it's rapture!  The vegetable lomein (5/5) my wife said is the best she's ever had.  The whole seasoning was just perfect; not overly done, oily, or salty.  We sat there and really challenged ourselves if it REALLY is that good, cause we some eatin fools especially Los chino, and we all agreed; no other Chinese  restaurant came to mind that was close!  You've got to try it!!",

It came with just rice and a few chunks of chicken in a sweet honey sauce that was delicious.   Other than a spring roll, there was nothing else on the plate. I am not sure if I expected something else, but the plate seemed rather plain.  There just wasn't much going on, but the flavors were good.  As always, I look for the small details.  The wood carving next to our table was covered in dust, as were the pendant lights above the tables.  With that said, the sanitation score was 95, which means they are doing a lot of good things.   They just need to get out their dust rags.  The service was fast, but when our plates were emptied, we got the feeling that they were ready for us to leave.  We stayed until closing time, which was at 2:30.   Decent, despite the dust.",

    "text": "Many years ago, I used to go to Wan Fu frequently with my parents.  After going there so much, I sort of got sick of it (?).  Flash forward well over a decade, I began to miss it...so I stopped in the other day.  WOW...I was surprised how great the place still looked after so many years.  It's as if the time stood still when it comes to Wan Fu...or let's just say that it aged VERY gracefully.  Beautiful, inviting decor aside, the food was stellar...as I remembered it.  I skipped the lunch menu and ordered the Pineapple Shrimp & Chicken Fried Rice, along with some Pork Dumplings and Hot 'n Sour Soup.  Again, everything tasted great...as expected...but what was the greatest was surprisingly the soup!  Honestly, it's the best Hot 'n Sour that I've had in years.  Then, topping the ambiance and the food was the service!  As expected in all Chinese restaurant, the waiter was ever ready and attentive...and the food came out quickly, all piping hot and fresh!  Even the host was quite congenial, checking up on me several times throughout the meal.  He even treated me to a complimentary dessert...without me even asking for it!  Then, as I was leaving the restaurant, he insisted on taking a picture of me...as a takeaway gift...lol?  He must have caught me taking pictures of my food, so guess he felt that a good mug/body shot will round out my picturesque dining experience!  Anyway, it was funny...and all very friendly.  How can I not give this a 5-Star rating after all that??  I've truly forgotten how good this restaurant was...and why it was my parents' favorite (while alive).  Though I used to take this place for granted back then, I can now truly appreciate it for what it is.  I even think this may be my new - yet an oldie - favorite Chinese restaurant.",

Plus, my suspicion is that the oil used to fry it was stale. The pepper steak was sweet, instead of salty. The cashew in the cashew shrimp was completely bad. The restaurant definitely has used the cheapest ingredient possible and doesn't care about its outcome.  Stay away!",

The worst was yesterday at lunch, they mixed up our order. We ordered a chicken steamer and vegetable spring role. They brought a vegetable steamer and chicken and shrimp spring roll. When we pointed out the error (the waitress had a strong accent, so we figured it was an honest mistake), the waitress became upset and argued with us that we ordered what was brought. She finally agreed to bring us what we had asked for, but set the new dish on the table with a bang and never came back. No apology and we were snubbed the rest of our visit. They did not thank us when paying or leaving as they usually do. It was very rude. I love the food here,  and don't even mind their higher prices, but they need to improve their customer service before we will return.",

This Holiday season is not the easiest time to start a diet!  This was my first dine ever at Wan Fu.  If you are not looking for it you may never see it from Highway 51.  So if you do not know where it is, consult the map!  Hopefully all of my reviews were written keeping in mind where I am for example, Wan Fu is primarily Chinese, so my aim is to mostly compare it to other (probably none yet that I have reviewed) Chinese Restaurants at a similar price range or if it makes more sense I would compare Diners to Diners and Not Diners to Upper-end Steak and Seafood Fine Dinning!  I hope that my love for Vietnamese, Thai and Korean does not reflect a cuisine from a different culture. So this is a harder review to write and judge fairly.  Most Chinese Restaurants I will avoid and never give them a chance.  Most of the others I have been to and would not return just to write a bad review!  Here was my dinner, comments and rating of each dish on this first visit:  Beef Appetizer good, not very good, just good 3.1 yelp stars.  Fresh Rolls, too much lettuce, still a good taste 3.2 stars.  Peanut Sauce, better than some (better than the ones that are primarily Hoison) though not to my liking 1.29 stars.  Plum Sauce, pretty good 3.5 stars.  The Entree:  Beef 3.2 stars, Sauce 3 stars, Vegetables: Asparagus and Red Peppers crunchy Fresh and perfectly cooked 5 stars.  Rice not rated!  Desserts:  The other one (I took Photos though I do not know what it was called)  I'd call it a Bomb Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate and more Chocolate = good enough for 3.8 yelp stars.  The second Dessert was a Black Forest Cheesecake something special for Black Forest Cake 3.55 stars (better than the one I had in a German Restaurant - In another review I said I am a hypocrite, so there!) the menu photo looked good and I was running out of choices until I leave this place and get more dessert.  Wait staff should never comment on the volume of food I order and they did not here, though they tried to bring me the check after the Appetizers and before each dessert and I had already asked about dessert after I placed my entree order!  The Service was a great Team effort, everyone was pleasant, polite and all dishes were served hot and as ordered!  For the service they get 5 yelp stars!  If you have not read my fortune cookie (see photo) from this visit what are you waiting for! ? !",

The last time was with family friends and we were able to occupy a semi-private room.  I am told that they have a party room upstairs for larger parties of 100, the room doesn't have any windows so I don't really know what the ambiance would be like... the food would definitely be the star attraction (as usual).  The best way to go is a large group of 6 and then order away... the lazy susan will help you int he middle of the table to fix your plates family style :)  Favorite veg is the Chinese broccoli, hands down... but there are many other tasty dishes on a large menu.  The food comes quickly... you eat what you desire... and you take home left overs!",

    "text": "I tried Wan Fu back in August 2012 because of the rave reviews and friend recommendations.   On the menu I noticed the prices are considerably higher than other Chinese restaurants in the area. Now, I understand that there's a difference between greasy garbage chinese food and quality chinese food. But even still, the prices were still high ($4 to $6 higher per entree). So I figured they must give larger portions than normal. NOPE, not the case.  Also, the food didn't surpass any quality of other local chinese restaurants. (I think Wild East is just as good, if not better. Great Wall is also a solid choice.) I just didn't see the $4+ per plate premium going anywhere. To top it off, a low sanitation rating... even for a chinese restaurant. I noticed this when I picked up my food.   The food was good, not great. The hostess was very nice. The prices are unnecessarily high IMO. Overall, not worth it.",

    "text": "I want to preface this review by saying I hVe been spoiled... Been to China a couple times and grew up in Flushing, NY which is the REAL Chinatown...and now I've arrived at Wan Fu.  The decor is a little overwhelming but cute.  You are greeted by a very welcoming host who takes you to your table and them the fun begins. We started with Jasmin tea which was perfectly steeped and then on to the soup!  Hot and sour soup was EXCELLENT!  Well balanced, not full of cornstarch and amazing flavor.  The wonton soup was delicious! Made with chicken which was an interesting surprise and tasty.  Not too salty :-). Next we shared the veggie dumplings which were good, nothing special but good if you like veggie dumplings. My husband had General Tso chicken(I have never enjoyed this dish as I don't think it is actually chinese food) but he enjoyed it and they make everything to order so it was super fresh.  At the server's recommendation I had the Szechuan beef.  It was not what I was used to as it was overly sweet and not at all spicy and it was heavily coated in cornstarch .... Kinda like general Tso so I didn't really enjoy it.  I feel like they may dumb down some of their dishes to cater to the American palate but I will be more forgiving than usual because of the amazing soup and freshness of the food.  I will definitely be back but steer clear of the Szechuan beef...but that's just me",

The waiter forgot to bring me back a container with that amazing Peanut Sauce, though! Favorites of our friends were also the Seafood Hot Pot and Eggplant, neither of which I cared for.

This place gave me some relief that Charlotte does have good Chinese food. I ordered shrimp lo mein as a carry out, the food was ready when they said it would be. I walked in to pick up my order, I counted four employees and no one acknowledged that I walked in. I stood at the counter staring at my pick up order for about five minutes before anyone cashed me out for the food. I'm glad the food is better than the customer service i received. The portion size is good and they gave me a lot of shrimp. This is the first dish I tried so far, so that and the customer service is why I rate it three out of five stars. I will visit this restaurant again. Also, the health sanitation rating is a 95% so that showed me that they kept their business clean.",

(These restaurant sanitation scores are published in the local free weekly south Charlotte newspaper) But I don't care because their food is delicious and I haven't barfed yet.  Wan Fu has a pleasant atmosphere and some of the hardest working servers around. The staff dress in beautiful traditional Chinese outfits. They try really hard to do the best job possible.   The food seems high quality and expertly prepared. The dishes are generous and worth the price. The cost is fairly high but you get your money's worth. Order with confidence and know that if you want to try something that you normally don't order, it will be made correctly. What I'm trying to say is that if you don't like the dish you order, it will be because of your taste preference and not because Wan Fu has poorly turned out that particular choice.  Bottom line is: great Chinese cuisine!",

Pre Bistro-Asian. When it was classy to eat lo mein.  Dark lighting. Lots of carving. Good, if demure service. Large menu, with all the Chow Mein hits and a couple of oddities:   Gai Lan served with any number of proteins (mostly dried mushrooms). Only place I've seen it in CLT.  Vegetable Shell - tofu skin stuffed with veggies (again, mostly dried mushrooms) over spinach in a light brown sauce. Good.  Almost MaPo Tofu - minus the all-important sczechuan pepper. Minus one star. Yes, I'm serious.  Oversauced is a good summary of the lettuce wraps we ordered, and I wouldn't again. Cornstarch killed it for me. Overuse of canned and dried \"delicacies\" works in some dishes (Vegetable Shell) but not others (Veg Lettuce Wraps, as I said) . But for me, it all reminded me of my first food adventures - eating dim sum and shark fin soup at 8, biting into my first baby corn or water chestnut, noticing how fun it is to eat something I'd never tried before. Throwback.  Awesome.",

    "text": "The atmosphere of this restaurant is five star.  Decor and lighting set a great mood. I actually felt a bit under dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans but I wasn't the only one dressed so casually.  The food was so so.  If you like Americanized Chinese you will be delighted as it was certainly a cut above most with that sort of menu.  I, on the other hand, love Chinese cuisine and even cook it extensively at home and do not appreciate the hybridization so much.  I ordered the tofu vegetable soup, pork dumplings, gai lan with oyster sauce, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the steamed basa in black bean sauce.  The soup had a nice chicken broth but the tofu was lacking, just a couple slivers.  The vegetables in the soup were a frozen medley* variety with the processed baby carrots, snow peas, and cauliflower.  The pork dumplings were certainly made in house and quite good. The gai lan with oyster sauce was actually shanghi tips (baby bok choy) with a thin brown sauce that was quite light in flavor and a sprinkling of jarred minced garlic ontop, not what we ordered (or on the menu as we could tell).  The eggplant in garlic sauce came to the table as eggplant with a szechuan style sweet and sour sauce.  The fish came to the table as a steamed fillet on a plate with the same frozen vegetable* ontop except the medley was peppers, onions, carrot, broccoli.  The sauce was not radically different than the sauce accompanying the shanghi tips with the addition of a sprinkling of fermented black beans in lieu of the garlic.  We gobbled it up, afterall it was Thanksgiving for these out-of-towners, and it wasn't bad.  In the end the name says it all: an American imitating a Chinese accent asking if you \"want food\".  *After reading my post I should add that everything was cooked to proper tempurature.  The frozen vegetables I referenced were in fact cooked!",

Our most recent visit was an early Saturday dinner after a long day of shopping. We arrived shortly before 6 and were seated promptly and served water and greeted by multiple servers. Within less than 20 minutes the place was packed. We started off with wonton soup and spring rolls. The soup was warm and hit the spot. As for the spring roll so light and fresh served with a mustard and sweet and sour sauce. As for the entrees we chose two to share, and unfortunately I don't recall the names, however, that will not hold me back from describing. We chose the duck pancakes, which are prepared table side, which I loved! The duck was sliced thin and placed in the pancake with onions, scallions and duck sauce. What a nice treat! We also chose the shrimp, scallops & chicken with broccoli.  The service was also extraordinary, as always, and I look forward to my next visit!",

Wan Fu is expensive for Chinese food. Fried rice is not an option with your dinner, so we had to order an extra meal in order to get some. Hint: the fried rice is bland, and not worth it. The bang bang shrimp was pretty good, and my wife had honey chicken which she thought was average as well.   There are lots of options out there for Chinese, so looks like we will be trying someplace else. We had very high hopes.",

    "text": "3 and 1/2 stars  Better than good, however short of excellent. Dinner prices run high for the venue which makes it a better bet for lunch, particularly on weekends.   The decor is kitschy Chinese -reminded me of movies from the 40's- the menu is extremely long, but there's nothing exotic or unusual about the choices.   -Hot and Sour Seafood soup. ($3.50) Mildly spicy, it looked and tasted unlike the typical hot and sour offerings and we enjoyed the taste, particularly the enoki 'shrooms. The bowl was small but priced accordingly and enough for starters. 4 stars  - Cold Sesame Noodles w/ Peanut Sauce ($6) a serving of stale pasta noodles with a dollop of commercially made sauce on top. Not fit for consumption.  0 stars  - Spring rolls, one meat one vegetarian Greasy, tasteless and pretty awful albeit when dipped the sauce made it passable.. barely. Personally I didn't feel cheated,  I'm no great fan of spring rolls, Since they're complimentary :  no rating  - Bang Bang Shrimp was the favorite. (lunch $8.50, dinner $14.50) I found the flavor mildly spicy, complex and rich. The dish was described as a curry on a bed of angel hair pasta, not what I think of as curry and honestly there was barely any pasta at all however the shrimp was both abundant and excellent, I'd definitely order it again -for lunch. 4 stars  - Scallops in Garlic sauce w/mushrooms, peppers etc (same $8.50/$14.50) also mildly spicy and tasty but with less bite and too sweet for my taste. Lots and lots of large scallops, I'm giving it an extra 1/2 star for that reason only. 3 1/2 stars  The service was trying hard but was clumsy to the point of rudeness, maybe just a cultural thing. We found it amusing and I'm not deducting any points for it - however under the wrong circumstances I could see customers going postal.  Short of hiding an Opium den upstairs I don't see how this restaurant could be mistaken for any 5 star establishment. However those with no expectations other than a good Chinese meal will likely be satisfied.",

I've been to multiple Chinese restaurants since moving down from NY back in 2012 and this is by far the best, most memorable restaurant yet.",

Wan Fu is a great place for authentic, affordable Chinese food you won't find anywhere else in the area. I eat here often with my family and the Emperor Shrimp is to die for - The fish was extremely good, very crispy and covered with a sweet and spicy sauce. Lobster with ginger was amazing, nothing I've ever tasted before. The staff at Wan Fu make you feel like you are always being taken care of. Would definitely go back with my family, and to those of you who have never been, you should give it a try! You won't be disappointed.",
