    "text": "Wow - stop everything you're doing and go to this place right now.  Here is what you should order:  1.) cevapi (chay-VOP-ee) with ajvar (eye-var) and kajmak (ok, I forgot how to pronounce this one).  The cevapi is 10 small sausages on homemade bread.  The ajvar is some tasty little tomato/vegetable mix and the kajmak is kind of like cream cheese but better.  OUT of this WORLD!   2.) eggplant napoleon - this was one of the yummiest things ever - mozzarella cheese on top of the homemade bread with eggplant and tomato bursting with flavor.  3.) roasted vegetables - i'm tired of explaining everything, just take my word for it.  We also got cockta (i guess it's a Bosnian coke - average).  Should have tried the Turkish tea.  Oh well, next time.  All this food, and it was a lot, was about $23.  Tremendous value!  And the family that own/operate the place were the nicest.  we checked out the Bosnian market which is connected to the restaurant and which they also own.  We picked up some interesting things.  I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "This ethnic market/restaurant is a little dive, but in a nice way. The restaurant side is a hole in the wall, with only five tables, spotless and as far away as possible from Charlotte's ubiquitous strip mall spaces were you eat while staring at a depressing parking lot.   The owner (I think) hovers over you eager to please but the food was slow to come out of the kitchen. Well worth the wait to me because it's delicious if you like peasant food from the Balkans with a heavy Turkish influence - which I do!- and very cheap too.  Turns out thanks to the Ottoman Empire's influence Bosnian cuisine closely resembles the Romanian cooking I'm so familiar with.    I love the cevaps (spiced ground beef) with the home made bread, sirnica (cheese pie made from Bulgarian feta) , the eggplant dish. To finish a slice of better than usual tiramisu was only 95 cents and the Turkish coffee was served with a little cube of Rahat Lokum.   Cheap dive, tasty, fun... not recommended for chain restaurant lemmings.",

Food was freshly prepared, albeit not \"fresh\" in the sense of having anything vegetable-y in it. This is a place to go when you're ready for a hearty, somewhat greasy and meat-heavy meal. Menu choices are simple and not extensive - but it's usually better to do a few things right rather than to do a lot badly. It's a fun experience, and the owners were very friendly and helpful. I'd happily recommend this place to anyone who wants to give their taste buds a new experience.",

Right next door is a grocery store where you can but some frozen versions of the dishes, but you really can't beat having it cooked to order.   Their 'To-Go' menu alone is better than most places I've been to. While ticket times may be less than desirable, it is so, so worth it.   Go here.",

Filled with delicious old world treats. I am half Serbian and Half Italian, believe me when I say that my Yugoslavian half was very happy today. I assume that the owner and the five other people in the restaurant were Bosnian. There was a lively Bosnian Soccer game on the TV...They were all cheering--but in between the owner was making my daughter and myself the Old World Specialties...Cevapi, with Ajvar and the chopped Salad with the White Cheese ( a thousand times better than feta) , The Sudzkice a long skinny sausage and a chicken kabob all served with a sour cream and fresh onions. The grilled flavor was terrific. Its a tiny place but the food is mighty, I will definetley go back and try the Burek and the Schnitzel. I went into the market after and purchased some of the Hot Ajvar and the Kajmak ( a cream cheese and butter mixture) to spread on bread. If you haven't tried it you should...they are very friendly and warm people....GO BOSNIA!!",

The bread is warm and chewy, the sausage is moist and flavorful, and the cheese and red pepper sauce served with it puts it over the top. I can't stop thinking about it. We also had a super-fresh salad with chopped veggies, feta (I think), and a tasty vinaigrette. The spinach and cheese burek was deliciously flaky and the Vienna schnitzel was simple and not in the least bit chewy (as I've experienced with other schnitzel dishes). The chef was also our server, and he explained the dishes while joking with us throughout the meal. There's a small grocery store attached to the restaurant that had a slew of European chocolates and candies available (they had plenty of other items, like pastas, jams, etc but I couldn't get past the chocolate). We will definitely be back. It's a little gem of a spot.",

    "text": "By far, this is one of the best places to eat in Charlotte! Great, inexpensive food! Among the overwhelming number of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and fast food places, Euro Grill & Cafe is welcome new and refreshing addition to the Charlotte's restaurant scene. I am not going to bore the reader with repeating explanations and correct pronunciation of some menu items from previous comments. All I am going to say, if you haven't tried \"cevapi\" yet, you don't know what have you been missing. This shouldn't be just another drive through place for a quick lunch, which it can be if you're in a hurry. But I suggest that you make your first visit to Euro Grill & Cafe into an experience. Whatever you try on the menu, you can't go wrong. It is most likely different than what you can find anywhere else in Charlotte. My suggestion is that you should definitely start your first visit with \"cevapi\" sandwich, which by the way, you don't just pick up and eat like any ordinary sandwich. You simply break off the small pieces of that delicious home made bread \"lepinja\" and make your own bite size mini sandwiches. To get the True experience, aroma and the best flavor out of each bite, on each piece of bread you should spread the layer of \"ajvar\", \"kajmak\" and diced onions as a base, and top it off with \"cevap\". Each bite just melts in your mouth. Once your entire sandwich is all gone, and it won't take too long, you should end it all with some traditional \"Baklava\" dessert and a True Turkish coffee. Baklava and coffee in itself is an experience which you shouldn't start the day without. Once you try the food there, it will keep you coming back for more and more...Oh, by the way, while you there, make sure you also stop at the store as well and pick up some delicious and unique items that you won't find in your local grocery store.",

    "text": "I tried this place out after reading Thomas' review below, \"stop everything you're doing and go to this place right now.\" I am really good at following directions when it comes to food!  I love to try new cuisines and had never eaten anything Bosnian or from that region at all, so I was really excited to try this out. I got everything to go since I was late for work already, and the food took about 20 min. to prepare. A man, who I'm guessing was the owner, was there all by himself today cooking, waiting tables, bussing tables, and working the register at the market next door. After about 5 minutes of waiting, he brought me out a salad on the house for me to eat while I waited. This was unnecessary, but extremely nice of him and I devoured the delicious salad. Before I left, I asked him what kind of cheese he put in my salad and ended up buying two pounds of it! The cheese is Krinos brand, Bulgarian White Cheese and is very similar to feta, but milder and not as dry.   Walking to my car I was positive of 3 things: I was going to burn the crap outa my fingers, I was going to spill on my work clothes before even getting to work, and I was going to start eating before taking pictures, I was ok with all of that!  I ate most of the Zeljanica (Spinach pie) on the way to work and it was absolutely delicious! The pastry was flaky and crunchy on the outside and the dough had a bite to it on the inside. The spinach filling was delicious and reminded me of something my grandparents (French and Hungarian) used to make when I was little. I cut up some of the cheese I bought and ate it along with this spinach pie and I was in heaven. The Burek, or meat pie was just as good. I believe the actual pastry was the same, it was just filled with meat instead of spinach. It was delicious and I dressed it with a bright red vegetable sauce the guy gave me along with my food. If had some spicy mustard I definitely would've put some on the Burek, I think that would've complimented it really well.  The last thing I tried was the Cevapi. It is a Bosnian flat bread that they split open like a pita. It had 5 skinless sausages in it, it's just ground beef which they shape into sausages, and it came with some raw onions on the side. The whole thing was great, but the bread was outa this world and now I think most sandwiches should be make with it! After a little research I found out it's called Lepinja, it's kind of like a fluffy pita/Ciabatta/Fry bread combination and it was delicious! I found a couple of recipes online but next time I'm in there I will ask if he sells the bread on its own so I can make all sorts of sandwiches with it!  This place is great and the prices are very reasonable. Each of the pies was $4.50 and one would be enough for a lunch on its own. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other specialties and definitely some Turkish coffee!",

    "text": "I really was not very impressed here at all. We actually stumbled upon this place in some online listing as I haven't heard many people talking about it elsewhere.  In general the venue didn't seem very well kept. The same owners manage the grocery store next to it so I imagine they are torn between the two spots at times. When I visited there was a table covered in food that looked to have been sitting there for a while and nobody in site to clean it up. It took some time for the one person who was working to come out, tidy up a bit and wait on us. In general wouldn't have been a problem with just one other person staffed. I suppose this is to be expected in a small space but could have made a better first impression if it were addressed.  For the food, it could just be that this particular cuisine isn't my style, I'm willing to admit that. The cevapi was suggested because it was a specialty so I went with that. Again, I'm willing to admit it might just be a preference of mine but this dish really wasn't very appealing. Back to the staffing issue, it took a while for our food to come out and when it did, I wasn't impressed by the presentation, how greasy it was and how limited the options on my plate were to break up the greasy meat and greasy  bread it was served on.   Unfortunately, I really can't see myself going back as I prefer cuisine with a bit more variety. I will say however that the meat pastries on the menu looked pretty good as well. If I were to head back, I'd give one of those a try.",

We had the Cevapi, Bosnian sausage, which was seared to perfection. The Bosnian coffee was excellent, served in traditionally on a silver plate with sugar. To top it off, the owners are just the nicest, most accommodating people. It was a joy to eat here and we'll definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "I am scared for this little gem of a place because I went during lunch today and it was empty! It makes me sad to see places like fast food chains or even my beloved Panera filled to max capacity but yet little mom and pop places like this remain empty. Do not be intimidated by the menu or the fact that it's not your typical American dishes, this food is approachable and tasty!  I consulted yelp prior to my visit and knew I had to give the Cevapi a try. While they look like sausage links they certainly do not taste like sausage! If anything it is very similar to Gyro beef/lamp mixture in a link form. The bread it is served on is simply outstanding. This is served plain with onions & tomato or with two sauce options ajvar, which is kind of similar to blended roasted red peppers and/or kajmak which the server referred to as sour cream (and it tasted identically). Anyway, both taste great. If you want an average sized lunch (and very filling at that) go with the smaller version...trust me, it is plenty.   We also decided to split the ground beef burek - it was good but didn't compare to the cevapi in my opinion. It was served with a side of pickled cabbage & carrots. Our server recommended putting the \"sour cream\" on it as well.   We ended the meal with two cups of Turkish coffee. Well as it turns out I do not like Turkish coffee very much. I can't fault the restaurant for this at all...I am usually one who skips the sugar but doubles the cream - so this was too stout. I will say if you're a strong coffee lover Turkish coffee is a must.   The atmosphere is quiet but seating inside is limited and a bit cramped. This is also connected to a Bosnian grocery store as well. The service is friendly -though distant,  but all in all I was fine with everything.  It is VERY reasonably priced for lunch - everything I describe came to $14 and I left food on my plate at the end of my meal.   I'll be back to get dessert!",

It's a very small restaurant with only five tables and very casual.  It's family owned and operated, and I like supporting non chain businesses.  The food was quite good, though I'm hardly an expert on this type of food.  I got a combination platter, which is what I'd recommend any first time guest do... so you can try a little bit of everything.  The restaurant isn't going to win any awards for style/decor, but if you just want some good authentic food, I recommend giving it a try.  There's also a small Bosnian grocery store attached to the restaurant to peek in when you're all done.  Parking was ample.  I'll come back!",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Euro Grill & Cafe in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte.   With an eclectic menu, you will find various Mediterranean, German, and Bosnian dishes. This is a small restaurant, only five tables, so you may have to wait. Dora here. Actually, the entire time we were there, every table was occupied, and people lined up. Don't wait until you're starving to go. Speaking from experience. :)  Only two people worked both the back and the front, and they were slammed. I must've looked about ready to pass out from hunger because they very graciously offered us a complimentary Sopska (a Greek salad) due to the delay on our meal.   Delicious, colorful, and some of the best Feta cheese I've ever tasted. Yum! I'd definitely order this again. We were both digging deep for the last few blocks of cheese. :)  When visiting a new restaurant with food from countries that I am not familiar with, I always like to try a variety of options. So I chose the Mjesano Meso. This Meat Lovers Medley included three pieces of skinless sausage (Cevapi), one thin burger (pljeskavica), one chicken kebab (raznjici), and one piece of spicy sausage, (sudzukice), all served on house-made Bosnian flatbread.   This was truly a sampling of the entire menu. The cevapi reminded me of breakfast sausage, and the pljeskavica would pass for an American hamburger. The chicken raznjici was tender and the sudzukice was great. But the star of this dish was the Bosnian flatbread. Soft and fluffy, I think I could have made a whole meal off just the bread.   Dora here. That flatbread rocks! So light and fluffy! And the kebab chicken was so tender. But I'm glad I ordered the Beef Burek. Filo stuffed with minced beef, it was tasty, light, and so delicate I had to check to make sure I was eating beef. I ate almost the entire burek, but didn't have that heavy, bloated feeling.  If you're hoping for ambiance or privacy, this isn't the restaurant. But you might be surprised at this tiny spot. Unusual dishes, large portions, and great prices. How can you go wrong?  We would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of good reviews of this place so I decided to try it out this morning. Came in around 11 am and it wasn't too busy. There was ample space to park in the back. I did try going in through the front and the door was locked, but a really nice customer got up from her seat and signaled me to go through the back instead.  Coming in from the back, you enter the grocery section. I didn't have time to explore (next time!), but it seems like they stock a variety of European products. To the left and down the stairs is the restaurant itself. A little small; I imagine it'd be packed during lunch or dinner, but I kind of liked that it wasn't too busy this morning... It felt like a nice getaway from the traffic just outside. Whenever I finished my meal, more people started trickling in, so I'm thankful I was able to get in at a relatively peaceful time.  As for the food, I ordered the small cevaps. I thought it wouldn't be enough, but I found it really filling! The ajvar and kajmak (so creamy, my favorite!) that came with it were really nice. The flatbread was so warm, soft and light, a little crunchy at the right parts.   I also ordered the Bosnian coffee and it came so beautifully served on a tray, with two sugar cubes and a small sample of Turkish delight. Honestly, if I lived closer, I would come here just for the coffee and Turkish delight. So good!  My meal came to just under $10 (small cevaps, Bosnian coffee, and tap water which is free [versus the bottled water which is not], also including a small tip). Not bad at all, especially for a student counting her pennies. The owner--and I'm assuming, his son (who served me and taught me how to properly drink Bosnian coffee, thank you!)--were so kind.   Great food, kind people, I'll try to be back again soon. =)",

    "text": "I love trying places like the Euro Grill & Cafe.  I didn't know the first thing about Bosnian food going in, or any Balkan cuisine for that matter.  But I'm not sure the Euro Grill & Cafe broadened my knowledge to any significant degree because the menu actually features few purely Bosnian items.  Instead, it's sort of a catch-all cafe, offering schnitzels, burgers, gyros, and even a Philly Cheesesteak.    There is a focus on cevaps, though.  That item consists of excellent kofte-like sausages served on a roll or flatbread similar to focaccia, but softer and oilier, along with housemade sour cream, a flavorful roasted-veggie spread (mostly red bell peppers?), and diced onions as condiments.  Overall, delicious.  Served in combo plate with fries that weren't especially noteworthy but that made for a huge amount of food for nine bucks.  There's also a sopska salad, which is much like a Greek salad but without the kalamata olives.  It comes in a huge serving that could probably satisfy a table of four as an accompaniment to other entrees.  The business consists of a tiny cafe with just three or four tables, plus a small market selling mostly Eastern European items in the back.  The lone fella operating the cafe and store on a quiet Friday evening (we were the sole diners eating there, although several take-out orders went out during our stay) was very warm and welcoming.",

I definitely recommend the cevipis, the meat platter, and the Turkish coffee. All delicious. They came with two sauces, a red pepper and a creamy white sauce. If you're interested, there are also some foreign sodas, several made using rose hips. On the other side of the restaurant is a lovely market, with all sorts of European cheeses, meats, and preserved products at really great prices. I definitely recommend it.",

I was thrilled to discover that Euro Grill & Cafe hadn't lost its touch after a few years and that it still deserves its lofty place in my heart.  The Bosnian Burger (Pljeskavica if you're confident in your pronunciation) is out of this world good. The meat is spiced to perfection with a ton of cheese on top and the lepinja is some of the best bread I've ever had. We also got the Cevapi/Sudzukice combo which was just as good (okay not quite as good but still amazing). I shudder to think how many calories I consumed with all that meat, but it was worth it without a doubt!",

I wasn't sure what to expect, but once we were inside, we found a cool little store with all kinds of eastern European treats. They had just about anything you could want and then some. The thing that really caught my eye was all of the cured and smoked meats they offered. They also had a small restaurant with a few tables, so we decided to check it out. The service was fast and friendly throughout our visit. I decided to try the cevapi sandwich as it seemed rather unique.  Once ordered, our food came out soon after. The sandwich was pretty straightforward. It had some grilled sausage on a buttered bun. It was served with raw onions, sour cream, and roasted red pepper spread. I really wasn't expecting much, but my assumption was terribly wrong. This sandwich was amazing.  It was probably the best sandwich I have had in a few years. The flavor combination worked incredibly well and it was so satisfying.  I did order the large sandwich and I was stuffed by the time I finished it and I was quite happy. Overall, we really enjoyed our visit here. The store, restaurant, food, and service were great.  I would highly recommend to anyone in the area.",

Start off with cevapi (beef sausages not unlike kofta kebabs) nestled in pita-like lepinja bread. Oh, and try the ajvar too - it's a very savory red pepper relish!  Once you're done, check out the adjoining market to buy some Bosnian goodies of your own! The selection is vast, and the prices are quite reasonable.",

It tasted like normal salty breakfast sausage on some bread with raw onions and a side of tomato paste sauce. It wasn't made clear to us too that it didn't come with any sides. The upside was the coffee was pretty good. Their store was interesting as well.",

    "text": "So I have to say I never would have come to Euro Cafe and grill... and even when I was going I missed it on Central. Nondescript, I've probably passed it a hundred times.   A Bosnian friend invited be there for lunch. The place is a bodega/restaurant with at most four tables. The owner is super friendly and was excited to see new people try out their menu. I have to say it was pretty authentic, they make their own cevaps (beef sausage) and that was my favorite. The prices are affordable and the service is pretty good!  I'm a fan.",

They have soccer playing on the tube tv and you can tell when the regulars come in. The food was so yummy and the family was so sweet. You can also walk next door to the connected market and pick up some unique groceries that you can only get at a European food store, like Kinder chocolate and toasted buckwheat.",

    "text": "This place is a gem. The place is small but cozy. We went to Bosnia last year and were excited to taste the food here in Charlotte. It was amazing. The warm bread is airy and delicious and we had ours full of cevapi. The large sandwich is huge so we were happy we ordered a small. Each sandwich comes with chopped onions and avjar- a roasted red pepper and eggplant mix to add to your sandwich. It is amazing and just like we remembered having in Bosnia. We had Bosnia coffee as our dessert. It was served beautifully with the best Turkish Delight I've ever had. The coffee was thick, bold and incredible. We can't wait to go back and dive deeper into the menu. We could see from the other tables that people liked the food as much as we did.",

It has everything I love, excellent food, a kind of food that NOONE else is doing in town, family owned, a friendly family at that, and it's super close to my house. The gentlemen owner always looks so cheery and has given me free kinder on occasion to thank me for my business. Ive tried a lot of things from here, but I do tend to revert back to my usual. So let me offer these recommendations...  What to get:  The spicy bosnian sausage- 5 spiced (not really spicy) sausages on some of the best bread you with ever eat this side of the pond. I actually prefer this to the cevapi (cue debate) Cevapi- is it a meatball? is it a sausage? who cares it is delish. Comes on the same delectable bread The \"Combo\" mix of the top 2...this is how I fell in love with the spicy sausage The white and red sauces- bosnian sour cream and roasted red pepper condiment respectively...necessities for the above choices. Try the spicy version of the red. The side salad- romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, FETA, the perfect balancing side act to the inevitable meat and bread goodness you will be so happily shoveling into your mouth hole  What to avoid: The only thing that I didn't LOVE here was the eggplant napoleon, just didn't do much for me   I hope this place stays here for a reeeeeeaaaally long time",

If you lived in Charlotte about 5 years ago, you'd remember a Vietnamese bubble tea business...this place took its place and left the decor.  It's bright, lime green. Friendly service. Good food. If you are hungry for some meat, this is the place. Definitely a meat and potatoes place and perfect for those winter months or days when  you are feeling extra hungry.  There is a clean, well-stocked Bosnian grocery store next door. Pick up some cookies, chocolate spread, and other treats on your way out.",
