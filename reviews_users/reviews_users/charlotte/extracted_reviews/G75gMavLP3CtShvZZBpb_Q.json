    "text": "My boyfriend's dad gave us the 2011 Entertainment Guide book for Christmas and, slowly, we have been exploring new-to-us-restaurants with our coupons. His dad also has the same book and used his coupon for Anntony's yesterday for lunch. His dad is not one to call us and rave about a place, but he said we needed to check it out. We checked out the menu that was advertised in the book to see if the food matched our tastes. I was excited to see they offered Caribbean Crab Cakes so we headed out to Anntony's for dinner.  When we walked in at 6:45, there was not a single person in the restaurant. We sat down and were handed menu's that differed from the menu in the entertainment book. I checked their menu on-line after dinner and found it to be correct with the menu at the restaurant though. The menu consisted of all chicken and some pork options. I was really disappointed to find that no crab-cake listed. In addition, their menu did not supply a description of the entrees, but it did for their sides. I found the menu very underwhelming.   I ordered the chicken wing dinner that was tossed in a special Caribbean sauce with their black beans and mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the chicken breast with collard greens and rice. The wings were okay, some were dry and some were not. He said his chicken tasted like it was leftover from lunch and was dry as well. The beans, mac and cheese, and rice were very good though.   Their slogan is \"Don't Worry About Nothin' Mon!\" I WISH! I was very worried while I was dining for the following reasons:  -They had two TVs on that showed depressing world events (Not sure why a restaurant has TVs in it, it's not a bar).  -The server, although very pleasant and sweet, did not have her hair tied back and wore a strapless dress with flip flops. We asked for hot sauce and she brought out a bottle of sauce with out a lid on it. Where was the Health Department when we needed them?  -Why were we the only people in the restaurant???   I can only assume that my boyfriends dad liked the place so much was due to the amount of food you get with the low priced meals and that lunch was a bit fresher than dinner.   I would not recommend this place for dinner. Maybe lunch is better, but the food safety and health issues are a bit concerning.",

I was a fan of their rotissarie chicken, black beans, and calypso rice. The service is generally bad, but we were willing to overlook that because the food was pretty tasty and affordable.  We never ate dessert here, but the owners apparantly have a catering business on the side and the sweet treats in the refrigerated cases on the way out look delish!",

I usually get chicken (for the sauce) but ribs or ox tails on occasion. The staff is cool. I enjoy the banter with the Manager...I guess since he's always there.

Thanks to yet another heavily discounted gift certificate, I returned.  I am glad I did.  We both had the the Two Meats Combination for $13.95.  You can choose from white and dark meat rotisserie chicken, roast pork, ribs, etc. and add two side orders.  The roast pork was a hit.  The rice, black beans, yams, and greens were also well received.  The chicken (white and dark) was also tasty.  We finished with some freshly home-made banana pudding, and some freshly store-bought turtle cheese cake.  The banana pudding was actually pretty good.  Our waitress, April was keenly attentive and just plain fun.  See you there sometime soon!",

Back then the dining room was much larger but now the restaurant focuses on catering and take-out with a few tables indoors and on the patio. The tangy sauce here is SO GOOD. The waitress told me they had to take the bottles of sauce off the table because people were taking the whole bottle! I love the combination of rice, slaw, sauce and chicken here. So good. Calvin enjoyed his curry chicken as well although the corn bread was a little dry. Try the swank - a tasty nonalcoholic drink that tastes like a combination of lemonade and iced tea. Wing platters, pork chops, pork ribs, collards, and mac & cheese (Monday only) are also offered. Glad to be back in town so I can come back to Anntony's often!",

We're convinced it was at least a day old and microwaved to a point of dusty and powder dry in my mouth. We told the server and she just gave us a blank look. The place was totally full with 6 people. They should just bow out gracefully and shut it down. The question is, what is really going on? Two words sums up this place, don't go!",

But I just learned that it's a franchise restaurant, albeit a local franchise, but this kind of knocked it down a notch for me.  I had the wings & the sauce they give you is awesome. I think they actually sell it by the jar too & I can see why. It was a Caribbean flavored sauce, obviously, & they coat it on the wings. While the wings may not have been the best I've ever had, the sauce definitely made up for it. They also had some odd side items that I wasn't exactly thrilled about. I actually had quite a problem figuring out which side to order.  Anntony's doesn't give off the franchise vibe, but once i found out it kind of irks me. They have a great Caribbean flavor that is quite different then other places in Charlotte. If you're looking to switch it up for lunch then head here, as you'll find a whole new taste then the normal lunch fare.",

The two that run the place obviously just don't care and their customer service is horrendous (or just plane absent) most the time.

She looked as if she overslept and put on whatever she could find to go and open up the place. They only had 1 order of wings,but l was confused as it is on 12 o'clock and you just opened. The food was not fresh and she warmed it up in the microwave. There was another couple in there eating but they left as it seemed like they were upset as well. Once they left, no other customers came in there to eat. Everyone was parking and going to Bang Bang Burgers to eat. As they left,they were peeking in to Anntony's to see if they were still in business. It was a waste of time and money. I will not return to this location,but will try the W.

But when I took the first bite, food I had the rib entree it was \"Very Bland\" so I took a few more & same result, I didn't stop there I called out to my daughter to taste & her response was \" where did you get that?

The greens were a little too tangy, the rice and peas was more like rice and beans.  They said they're known for the sauce, that too was too tangy.  The cornbread just fell apart, but that was the best part. $11 dinner, overpriced for serving.  The chef and cashier were lovely, I asked them for the best of what they had and this was it.  My taste buds prefer less soul and more Caribbean. Tried it, doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "There's a reason this place has been here for 35 years - that sauce!  Food: My most recent trip was for takeout, but I've dined here a few times. We got the half chicken, double potato salad side w/ complimentary cornbread (pictured).The chicken is deliciously tender rotisserie-style chicken, smothered in the signature jerk chicken sauce. It has a mild/medium spice level with a complex combination of flavors. The potato salad is a mayonnaise-based salad with the same spices as the jerk chicken - the flavors start off old school southern with a Caribbean finish. The cornbread is pretty basic and slightly sweet. The side of greens is also a popular choice that's vinegar-based with stewed tomatoes.   Atmosphere/Service: The service was fine, nothing really to note there when you're picking up a take out order. The interior is very a basic with minimum flare or thought put into the decor. They used to have a medium-sized restaurant, but they downsized to becoming a tiny hole in the wall. I'm not sure if they needed to cut costs or what, but I wouldn't want to dine-in here - strictly a take out kind of joint now.   The price point here is nice and cheap. A giant half chicken serving with two sides and cornbread for $11 - not too shabby!",

    "text": "The food is bad but the service is even worse. We've been before with Groupons and weren't ever super impressed but it's always been cheap and fast so we'd go back now and again. The place has hit rock bottom recently though. We went in for lunch at noon on a Saturday and found the restaurant completely empty. We decided to sit outside since the weather was so beautiful. The female employee that greeted us (she was outside playing on her phone and rushed inside behind us) told us to sit anywhere and she'd come take our order.   We took our menus and sat at the rickety picnic table on the patio. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually, Ted went inside to try to place our order. He found the waitress on her phone - she stopped talking long enough to tell him, \"Go back to your table. I'm a waitress. I'll come take your order.\" We should have just left then. Instead, we waited outside until she came out for our order. This was the point I noticed that she had a hole in the crotch of her yoga pants and no, she wasn't wearing any underwear. Again, why we didn't leave then is beyond me.   We ordered a rack of ribs, a whole chicken, and collard greens. (There were 4 of us, btw.) About 5-10 minutes after ordering, she came out to tell us that there was a half a rack of ribs available immediately. When we indicated that we'd wait for the full rack, she coped one of the worst attitudes I've ever experienced from a waiter or waitress and told us, \"Well, you'll be waiting over 3-hours then,\" and stormed inside. FINALLY having enough (3 strikes and you're out?), we got up and left. I'll never be back.   I only hope they go out of business sooner rather than later so a quality spot can move in to their prime real estate in Pecan Pointe!",

Bang Bang Burgers now occupy the old section.   The waitress/cashier greeted us immediately upon entry and was friendly throughout dinner. However, while putting in an order for appetizers and drinks, they were out of beef patties and the island swank tea which is a bummer. Ok well let's order our entree. After placing our orders, we find out 5 minutes later that they don't have enough chicken wings. Wow, best to just tell me from the start what you don't have! Seems like everything we ask for, they are out if.  The chicken and ribs were pretty good with the special Antonnys sauce. Calypso rice, rasta pasta and greens weren't seasoned enough, but mixing in the sauce gave it much flavor. Overall the food was tasty. To stay in business,  Antonnys must ensure that menu items are on stock each and every day.",

I decided to order the chicken breast/thigh combination with sweet potatoes and black beans.  The chicken was prepared well and the Caribbean sauce was delicious.  While the sweet potatoes may have been prepared Caribbean style, I didn't care for them.  The black beans where simply edible.  That said, I am giving Anthony's 2.5 stars rounded up.",

They had two left,  if you were curious. So I said I will take the two. She told another employee \"two beef patties\" halfheartedly and I thought, \"these people are bumming me out!

They have a nice sized outdoor patio, but the inside is very tiny. There are only about 5 tables. However, we were greeted instantly as we walked in. I was a little skeptical at first because it wasn't the nicest restaurant from the initial looks of it, but the food made up for it.   I ordered the 1/4 chicken combo which came with two sides! I got a side of the rice (awesome) and the Mac n cheese (don't judge me for ordering two carbs). The chicken was so good! It was HUGE and it literally fell off the bone. The sauce was also really good. It was a cross between jerk and sweet. The server even told us a little secret on how they 'make' the sauce ;-)  I'm not kidding when I tell you my meal was huge and get this- it was only $8.95.   My husband got the two meat combo- 1/4 chicken and wings 5). I would recommend getting the curry chicken or Caribbean chicken next time as the regular chicken and wings came with the same sauce, but they were delicious.   I'm glad I tried Anntonys and I think I will be back in the summer for lunch! They had a jerk and Caribbean wrap that sounded bomb.   I'm a fan.",

They had 2 hours til closing. Second time today. Guess I need to get my Groupon money back. At this point I have concerns about the freshness of their food",

I placed a pickup order through the yelp app and they charged me ~$3.50 more than the total on my online order confirmation. When I brought up the difference to the cashier, they just shrugged it off and said the app's prices were out of date. So.. be careful if you're ordering through yelp.",

    "text": "I'm sad to post this bc this place use to have AWESOME food, but after this last visit, I'll never go again. (I wouldn't have given any stars, but Yelp won't let you do that.)  There was a fish smell to my mom's & my chicken, so we didn't eat it for fear of food poisoning. My daughter said her's tasted odd. The greens had the smell of cafeteria greens & certainly didn't taste the way they used to. Also, the rice was bland & dry this time. The cornbread was soggy & mealy.  We'd called ahead to pick up our order for about 20 minutes out, but we still had to wait 10-15 minutes for everything. One of the 2 guys working there parked his car in the closest spot to the door of the restaurant (my mom picked up on this as she saw him get something from his car while we were waiting for our order). And they say bathrooms tell a lot about a place...it certainly did in this instance.",

I called back it was so bad. The staff said the manager would have to call me. After a few hours passed. His resolution was not to replace the meal but to come back and purchase something else for 50% off.  I told him I would not spend one more dime there and the food there I had was nasty.  His attitude did not reflect a business owner who was about customer resolve.  He prided in saying he has been in business for 20years.  Does he really think that makes his brand Great!  I don't and would never spend money in this establishment ever again.",
