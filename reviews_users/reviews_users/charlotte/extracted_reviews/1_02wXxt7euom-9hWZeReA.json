Very crowded and you need to wait to play the games so I expected more lounging areas. Bartenders are very rude! We got seats by the bar and once seated we asked for a menu, the bartender threw the menu at us and had an attitude that he had to wait until we got our orders in. The ladies in the back bar are also rude. I came up to order a drink and one of the girls ignored me. A guy came to order a drink and she served him. The other girl didn't even attempt to try and help me. Overall the place is ok but service is horrible!",

Drink were great too--my margarita was delish and my boyfriend got two Bloody Mary's. Their liquor selection is pretty premium and we still thought our bill was fine. Next time we definitely want to try out some of the games!!",

The bar wasn't crowded at all and it still took her awhile to get us drinks and cash us out. Overall a fun place though!",

I could have been charged for anything! Also when I arrived I used the restroom. Three of the five bathroom stalls were out of toilet paper, no paper by the sinks only hand dryers. One of the toilet seats was also covered in poop while the bowl was completely empty. I then went to bowl for an hour and a half (the screen counts down). When I used the bathroom again, still no toilet paper! They also put a sign on the stall with poop on the toilet lid saying it was broken instead of cleaning it. THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING FOOD. This place is filthy.",

Why would you not take the common courtesy to explain to your customer the absence of mint? Additionally, if your bar is relatively empty - multiple bartenders should not walk by you and not take your drink order. Unbelievable horrid experience.",

    "text": "This place is a lot of fun and we really enjoyed our night here. I'll start with all the positives first. They have a bunch of games (bowling, skeeball, basketball, giant jenga, cornhole, shuffle board, ping pong). The space is huge, so even when it was super crowded, you could still move around. You have the option to sit at a table and have a server for lunch/dinner or just grab a drink at the bar and wander around. You also have your own server when bowling. The patio area is really nice and it's right across from OMB, Broken Spoke, and Sugar Creek.   Now the cons; for bowling and shuffle board, you have to be on the wait list. We got a bowling lane with no problem, but the shuffle board wait was 2 hours  Bowling was also extremely expensive. For 4 people, it was $60 including shoes, and you have a time limit on the lane. Not the greatest when you're trying to eat, drink, socialize and bowl simultaneously. Skeeball was also $1 per game which is pricey compared to other bars that have games. The food was mediocre, bar food. We had the trio dips with nachos and chicken fingers and we weren't too impressed. They were good to snack on though. The service is a little slow, but there are a bunch of servers walking around and everyone was extremely friendly so that was really cool.   Overall, this place was pretty nice. I would recommend it for the free games (cornhole, giant jenga) and to relax on the patio for some drinks. Not recommended for food or for playing the costly games.",

I am not a fan of cold spinach dip and this one was cold. Other than that, it was nice. They made sure the food was replenished and bartenders were on top of the drinks. There was more than 100 of us and I didn't feel like I waited long for anything. I mean you can eat, drink and play all in one location.  Some of the games are free, jenga, large connect 4 and shuffle board but some of the other  you have to pay. It is worth bringing  a group of friends and having a good time.

Every time I have visited, I have to wait 20+ minutes for a drink at the main bar and my tab always has random drinks charged to it. Staff more than 3 bartenders on a busy Saturday afternoon and stop overcharging people. Regardless, I won't be back.",

    "text": "This place is pretty cool.  Overall it's a bit too pricey for me personally the value is really not that bad at all.  The food is not too shabby either.  They have these chicken nachos and they are so good.  I tried their chicken tenders as well those were bomb too since they are like homemade or something.  It's not what you'd expect like normal chicken tenders you normally find.  I was impressed by the seasoning and flavors.  They make good fries both regular and sweet potato ones.  It was kind of crowded when I came and a lot of people were upset because Adams Beverages had rented out the lanes and games from 3 to 6.  So normally you'd be able to bowl and play a bunch of cool things.  They had a bar so you can get your drink on.  The atmosphere was really fun and energetic.  The bathrooms were decent, up to date, clean for the most part.  I'll tell you this trick if you wanna go when it's not that crowded check Google Maps.  It will usually show you a live view of how busy it is there.  Oh yeah don't forget those sliders those were super bomb too!    I'm ready to go back with friends and I'd recommend planning a longer visit if you want to get the full experience.",

    "text": "Update:  So guys I finally tried out the food and the bowling....  I signed up for emails from QPS and received an email on Saturday about brunch. They were advertising a $15 bottomless rose mimosa special from 11am-2pm so of course I got the gang together for Sunday brunch. Bottomless. Mimosas.  We arrived at QPS around 11:10am. I thought the place was going to be packed, but it was actually pretty empty. We were told we could sit anywhere so we chose the bowling alley area because comfy couches. J We sat down around 11:15am and ordered the mimosas and food. I went for the Chicken and French toast. I don't think anyone, including us, considered that alcohol couldn't be served until noon. Let me tell you, that was a thirsty 45 mins. They should've mentioned that in the email, but I'm guessing this is the first time they've tried a brunch drink special.  The cool thing was that we were able to bowl at the same time. We ended up paying $56 in total for 4 shoe rentals and an hour of play on one lane. Not too bad, but I don't go bowling on a regular basis so don't take my firm word for it. I was surprised that the floor was actually pretty slippery with the bowling shoes. I'm pretty sure my Chuck Taylors would have had more grip than those shoes. I'm not sure if it was the wood floor or the shoes. Overall, bowling was cool. Don't expect an A+ bowling experience. The bowling pins are on strings (which is the strangest thing) so we felt like sometimes more bowling pins should've been knocked down. The lanes are also shorter than normal. I did like that we could play different games, like HORSE and change the screen characters.  Our food finally came out about 10-15 mins later. The chicken and French toast come out kabob style, which I wasn't expecting, but it looked pretty cool. For a \"chicken and waffles\" dish, I would give it a 4/5- not the best, but still good. The chicken wasn't dry and the French toast was pretty good. Oh, back to the mimosas. They were actually kinda gross. I think she said it was mixed with Izze, which I love btw. I was expecting a traditional mimosa with OJ and rose, but that's not what we got. It just didn't taste like a mid-morning drink.  Our server was great! She was super friendly and kept the mimosas pouring! We moved around QPS and played different games for about 2 hours and she would come check on us after once in a while.  Overall, this place still has some work to do, but I'm trying not to be too critical because it's new. It's a new concept. They service here is great and as long as they do their best to keep the customers happy, they'll receive a good rating. I had fun here and enjoyed the food.   ---------------------  QPS is so much fun! I went last night around 10pm for the soft opening and it was worth the wait. I've been so excited for this place to open ever since I heard about it at yoga on tap at OMB.   I really love the ambiance of this place. It's very spacious and has a industrial/retro feeling. Each area has a different vibe. If you like chill settings, the patio is perfect and if you're looking to mingle, the bar is where you want to be.   The bar is really cool and has 18 beers on tap as well as a variety of speciality drinks. I went for \"The Walter White\" because Breaking Bad, obvi.  The base was tequila and it was amazing! Highly recommend. What I really like about the bar is that they don't keep your card when you open a tab, so no more lost debit cards. Yus!   As for games, there's a basketball shooting game, skee ball, jenga, ping pong, corn hole, 2 giant shuffle boards, 2 traditional shuffle board tables, and of course, bowling.   We didn't try bowling or the food, but definitely next time! This place is perfect for switching it up on weekends. The same bars can get so boring. I'll definitely be back soon.   The two things I think would really spice up the place is a live DJ on like Friday or Saturday nights in the bar area and milkshakes. Yummm.  Other details: - ATM on site - 4 tvs & jumbo screen at the bar  - Jumbo screen in game room  - Maybe 1 or 2 tvs in the dining area - Parking is free and there's plenty of it along the street and on the grassy area across from OMB",

    "text": "We arrived hungry at about 6:45 on a Saturday, and for our party of 10, we ended up waiting over 2 hours and finally were able to sit when we offered the suggestion of splitting our party in 2.   The decor is very nice, industrial with a touch of glam. I love the large bar when you walk in, the aqua retro chairs and the different rooms (bowling, shuffleboard, dining, etc). Great place to hang out on a Saturday night with friends.   I had the Dancing Bear drink which was pretty good, so were the onion rings!  Our party was seated at two tables (due to lack of tables for large parties - there is only 1) and my table experienced very poor service compared to the other table for our group. Their orders were taken immediately and they were served their food within about 20 minutes. Our experience was quite different. It took about an hour for us to receive cold food. I ordered the Queen City burger, it arrived lukewarm, medium well (I asked for well), with bacon that was hard and chewy and on stale bread. I ordered wings, they were not that great, but it could be because I don't like breaded wings. Flavor was good though.   The manager came to check on us and he got our food expedited somewhat, I appreciate that. But I was pretty disappointed that when he returned later to see how everything worked out and I explained to him the issues with my burger, he nodded his head, told me to give them some time and come back, then walked away. An apology goes a long way, but I didn't get one. He didn't seem to care that his guests had a negative experience at his establishment.   What made this so frustrating is that we had patiently waited SO long for a table, didn't even complain... we ordered drinks at the bar, fries, onion rings, just hung out. The two tables that we were eventually seated at had been empty for close to an hour. No one bothered to ask us if we would be willing to split up so we could be seated. WE had to make the suggestion. So at this point I'm starving and aggravated. Now I have to wait an hour to get wings and a burger and they aren't even hot? Not good. I wanted to try the homemade ice cream, but it wasn't even worth the hassle. Maybe there was a rush to open Queen Park for the Final Four as one of my friends speculated and maybe they called in everyone who was available to help, all hands on deck. But I hope that there is some much needed training of the permanent staff. Otherwise there will be more reviews like this...  I definitely think this place has potential to be a great spot to hang out and get some good food, but there are a lot of kinks to be worked out in the kitchen and with the service for sure.",

    "text": "Let's just say this place is like a Chuck E. Cheese's but for adults.  Instead of the singing dancing robots and a ball pit.  Queen City Social has a full wrap around bar, dozens of TV's/ huge projector, a bowling alley, skeet ball, shuffle board, ping- pong, free throw basketball and places to lounge around all in between.  It has its own niche for the bar scene and a great place for a date or after work drink to decompress.  It's fun and a good time.  What more could you want?  Service.  It could use way, way better service.   The bartenders are rude and one in particular seems to always be in a bad mood.  A bad attitude is like a flat tire, you can't go anywhere until you change it.  The wait staff forgets orders frequently but from my experience whenever mistakes do happen, it's discounted or on the house.  I appreciate that and it shows good faith.  But overall, needs improvement.  That brings me to the food, I don't go to a place like this to eat.  I'm there to bowl or play skeet ball.  The food is alright or average, nothing special.  I think it's fine where it is, the main focus should be on the service and amenities.  A business like this is shape entirely around service and having fun.  You can't do either without the other.   Bartenders are rude.  Atmosphere is awesome.  Food is alright.   ***Update***  NC State Fans beware. Even though they have a NC State football helmet at the bar, it's a decoy. Do not expect to watch the game! This is the bone I have to pick. When a place like this has 28 maybe 30 TVs(I counted), you should at least have a cooler football game repeated on two TVs. Wrong. I had to beg to get one of the bar TVs to feature the 9 Norte Dame vs 14 NC State game. When they had the 3 Georgia vs Florida game on everywhere.  Come on, that game is a joke. But the excuse I got was even worse.  When I ask if they could please feature the game on one of the televisions in the game area they said, \"well the owner is a Georgia fan\". Excuse me? Guess the customer doesn't come first, seriously the service here is pathetic.  Also, I mentioned we want to spend money and watch the game, guess they don't care about that either. It won't be around in another year.",

It's located in an old warehouse so there is nothing to deflect the sound which causes it to be almost unbearably loud.    It seems to be a popular place to go.  It's within walking distance of OMB.  There is hardly any parking available and the parking that is available is on the street or in a small gravel parking lot.

Ashley was awesome she was so helpful and fun to chat with.  We arrived everything was set and Our group had a great time.  I had a chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The bun and chicken were so fresh!  There were a lot of burgers at our table and everyone enjoyed those as well.  Someone even raved about the nachos and their quesadilla.  They have really good mules and lots of beers on tap. After we ate we headed over to bowl. The prettiest eight lanes you ever did see.  And the sofas are amazing!!! There are servers in the alley too, so you can eat and drink in there if you'd like. And on tuesdays it's only $5!  We had so much fun.  They have indoor and outdoor space,  A huge Jenga game, checkers, cornhole, and more.  The staff was super friendly and nice.   Oh and they have really good ice cream",

The fries were home made, crisp and delicious. The ranch is homemade so they win points for that. The classic burger was about a 6/10, just a standard burger, nothing that knocks your socks off. The chicken tacos were average as well. The chicken tenders were some of the best we've ever had.  The cons: the waitress told us the pitcher served 6-8 but it really only poured 5 10 ounce glasses which was disappointing. The service is EXTREMELY lacking. The waitress was enthusiastic but she may have been overworked so I'm not sure if it was all her fault. The kitchen did not bring out food out at the same. My husbands food came out 10 minutes after mine. One of the girls in our group ordered a drink and it never came.   In summary, They have good potential but the servers absolutely need more training and probably more servers. Don't come here expecting to be in and out in under and hour or expecting good service.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love games?  Queen Park Social, though a bit further out from Uptown than I normally venture, is located on a fun little strip of breweries and other social hang out spots and is great for group activities.  There's stuff that caters to everyone here, including bowling and cornhole, both of which I partook in during my particular visit.  The staff are relatively friendly, though I had to wait an extra good 5+ min or so while the lady behind the bowling counter chatted with her friend who was also at the counter, who I'm not even sure was buying anything.  She almost pretended like I wasn't there.  Oh well.  Prices are fair.  I think we paid $40 something dollars for an hour of bowling which I guess is kind of expensive for a city like Charlotte.  Shoes are required, but apparently you don't actually have to put them on.  Cornhole only requires you leave your drivers license up at the front desk and they give you the bean bags.  I believe there were 2-3 sets of cornhole outside in the back.  They have some lighting back there so you can still play at night.  Love cornhole!  Ambience was decent on a Wednesday night... it was a summer night and people didn't have school, so there was a decent amount of people, but it was definitely not crowded.  I think the group of 15-20 or so we had made the night.  There was music, but nothing blaring in your ears like some of the other reviewers state - maybe because it was a weekday?    I can't comment on the food since we didn't have any of it, but the drinks were flowing all night.  Service was decent.  Great place for group events, but be ready to shell out a little.",

    "text": "Since most of the knocks I read on this place were about its service, I felt the need to post about the positive experience we had.    We got there near opening on a Sunday.  We had a group of 8 and we sat in the gaming area.  Our server Nick was fantastic.  He managed our group of 4 separate tabs perfectly and he was very attentive about checking on our needs for drinks/food.  He helped us with the games as well.  5 Stars on Service.  The space is great and while we left our kids at home, there were plenty of kids in the game area and I would feel totally comfortable bringing my kids during the day and letting them run around and play the games.  I could see it being less kid friendly in the evening when the crowds get bigger.    I'm only going to 4 stars on the food.  The food was all good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't really next level.  The charcuterie plate was under par.  Everything else was definitely good, not great.  But hey, that's ok.  It worked for what the place was.    I'm looking forward to going back soon.",

    "text": "Visited QPS yesterday for the first time around 5pm.  Fairly quiet.  Not many people seated at the bar but there were several bar staff (I thought) that were working.  Jessie was very prompt and welcoming us to the bar and got our drinks quickly.  It did seem she was the only one working the whole bar.  Most of the other staff just chatted with each other.  If this is the norm I can see why others have made note of the slow service.  Staff/Guest engagement is on the Service Managers though.    Once we got our drinks, we walked around the place and felt it looked super nice and would be fun for a lot of people.  There were definitely several children running around like it was a playground and I guess it is!  Lot's of space around the game tables - skee ball, hoop game, table shuffleboard, regular shuffleboard, ping-pong, dart board and of course bowling!  A small, but nice outside area with the iconic Queen Park sign center stage!  Very nice!  We went back to the bar and ordered the Chicken Wrap and the Queen City Burger (without peppers)  I didn't taste the chicken wrap, but it was noted as good, but I was told the burger had more flavor than the chicken.  I really liked the burger and would get it again.  The slice of Queso Fresco was good with it.  Cooked a perfect medium-rare.  The fries had skins on, but not too thickly and the crisp was great on the fry. (to me skin-on fries can be floppy if not dried and fried well enough)  After we finished we hung out on the patio a bit and enjoyed the beautiful afternoon.  Definitely a nice patio with plenty of space for lounging.  We could hear the music from OMB and that was nice too.  I like that they put the railings up in a way that somewhat blocked the parking and street when you're sitting down.  It made it cozy since it was so quiet.  It will be interested to see how it handles a bigger crowd during sports events/weekends.  I would definitely go again and look forward to visiting often!  Great concept and great location.",

They also screwed up on a simple salad- i asked for something not to come on it and - you guessed it.  I really didn't like the loud top 40 garbage blaring overhead at the bar, so much so the bartender couldn't hear me asking for a receipt- so she nodded, pretending to hear me- walked off and didn't return. Weird.  They've taken elements of hipster hangouts and popular urban restaurant concepts and merged them into an amalgam that's \"cool\" the same way urban outfitters makes you look original.  They have bowling (a few lanes) and a few little games, (ski ball, foosball, shuffleboard the obligatory jenga inside and cornhole boards outside) so it seems familiar, but it feels like just another marketing gimmick. This most alluring thing about this place is the kitschy 70s looking lit sign in the back lot that promises something which it does not deliver.",

Overall we had an expensive and lackluster experience which is a shame because you can tell a lot of work went into creating the space.  We came on a Saturday for games and started with cocktails at the bar. QPS does make a good cocktail! There were a few games to choose from but there wasn't a change machine so we were left sitting on the couch after only a couple minutes of pinball and one round of the free giant connect four. Instead of pestering the busy bartender for quarters we decided to move on to dinner.  Our server at dinner seemed super friendly but also spacy. I felt like he started walking away from me before I finished asking questions or for things each time he stopped at the table. My burger that was ordered well done came out far too pink for my taste. It was also greasy and was unevenly seasoned with random slices of jalapeno that made some bites ridiculously spicy and other bites not at all. The boyfriend had the chicken fingers which were bland.   The space is huge and has a cute retro chic vibe and the cocktails were good. The games were only slightly more plentiful and varied than a normal bar and less so than many of the game themed bars in Charlotte. While the pricing isn't outrageous there was definitely some buyer's remorse when the check came and we realized we could have gone to any one of the nearby breweries for half the price and twice the quality.",

My friend immediately text me to tell me that it smelled awful inside, specifically \"like feet & @$$..\" But, they still decided to continue the visit.   When I entered, yes I agree with her assessment. They were very, very busy and it took quite some time for someone to stop by and assist our table. We finally got some help and she was friendly and helpful! There was a DJ with a few people taking to the dance floor. The DJ, along with the huge crowd made it very loud inside.  Cold beer and tasty apps are a good reason to return. The restrooms were large and clean. There is plenty of parking around the lot and neighborhood.",

Maybe it was the couple of beers I had had previous to entering into QPS, but the hostess kinda/sorta greeted us and then there was some confusion on where to sit.... It seemed like it was \"sit anywhere you like\" but we walked to the bar area and the hostess kind of followed us...  Regardless, maybe they are still working out the kinks in there service system.  First impression was pretty cool.... nice wood tables and industrial looking finishes.  Our server Candice was super nice.  She made sure we had more chips for our queso and that we were good with beverages.  I ordered a much needed QPS Burger and fries.  Food was decent and there seemed to be something for everyone on the menu (nothing too extensive, but a one-up from regular bowling alley foodages).  Full bar available... local beers (one cider.... but not local) on tap.  They did have some local cider in bottle/can form.  From what I could see... arcade games, bar games (giant jenga), 8 bowling lanes (looks like they were having a private event cause the lanes had a spread of food on them.  Everyone looked to be having a good time (even for a Tuesday night).  I bet on the weekends, this place can get crazy, but for now I will stick with my more manageable weekday crowds.",

First and foremost, the restaurant and gaming areas are extremely nice, well kept and the food is very good.   Secondly- the service is atrocious. I've been to QPS about 5 times total with different groups for lunches, dinners, or simply drinking a few at the bar. Across the board the service is below par. Bar tenders are inattentive, lazy, and lack any energy especially for that type of bar.   My last visit - I waited 15 mins at my table for the waitress to arrive. I gave up and went to the bar. After returning to my table the waitress only came by the table twice in and hour and half to check on refills. When we were finally ready to leave, we waited 25 minutes for the waitress to come by to simply ask for our check. A member of our party went to the bar to ask if he could help us out and his reply was \"yeah she is around here somewhere if you want to go find her\". ....Really??   Long story short - food is good, bar and gaming area are amazing, service is terrible.",

I really find QPS to be a unique spot in town!  While we didn't bowl, we took advantage of cornhole, shuffleboard, foosball, connect four, skeeball, and more. Nearly all of the games just require your debit card as collateral, which is nice. They had $2 mimosa specials, and a good mixed drink menu/beer selection. It has a little something for everyone, which made it ideal for a bigger group.  I've heard it gets busy on weekend nights, but it's a super chill place to hang out otherwise.

We ended up asking a guy who seemed to work there what the deal was with the games. He shared what was free and what we needed to pay for. He mentioned darts, and said it was in the outside area. We definitely wanted to try that, so as we got outside there were none. I'm not sure if they only have them during certain times of the year, due to weather. But we were disappointed we couldn't play.   Overall, it's a neat place once you figure it out.",

I have been on two occasions and both times the food was far above what I expected.  Having lived in Dallas, TX for about 2.5 years at one point in my life, I can say with confidence that their queso dip is the best I've had in Charlotte.  Everything else I've tried is fantastic as well (grilled wings, Brussels sprouts appetizer, BLT wrap).  The space is beautiful, an amazing combination of classy and relaxing.    The only reason they do not get 5/5 is because the wine pours are a little on the short side (not sure if it was just the bartender that night or if that's just the way it is) and for the amount of wall space the place has, relatively few TVs.  I can say with 100% certainty that if the space had 10-15 more TVs in the dining/bar area it would become my GO TO spot for watching NFL Sunday Ticket on NFL Sundays.",

Usually bars have stipulations as to what they can change or what accommodations they can make, but I asked my bartender if I could just get a plate of stir fry veggies w/ extra mushrooms. They made it happen. They actually brought out two nice sized plates of some bomb a** stir-fried mixed veggies ( I think only other vegans can appreciate this lol) . I boxed one up and devoured the other.  ALSO, the DJ was really good!! We didn't get to play any of the games, but next time we plan to get in on some Uno, basketball, and bowling!",

    "text": "I was super excited to visit Queen Park Social! Before my birthday visit , I scoped the place out. It's very spacious with room for both small and large parties. I spoke to Ashley who was very helpful. She showed me the brunch and all day menu. Joe, one of the other managers, was also very helpful.   A glance at the brunch menu had me excited for my visit. Brunch and bowling? Sold! We arrived shortly before 1pm on Saturday. The left  side of the joint was empty with a few people sprinkled around the bar. The bowling area was empty. We set up our party on the high top tables in that area. I walked in ready to order a couple of brunch dishes and a mimosa! I was disappointed to find that brunch menu wasn't being offered yet :(. It took me awhile to get over that blow.   Our waitress, Shay, was very apologetic and offered her suggestions from the lunch menu. We ordered the grilled lemon pepper wings, the fried chipotle wings, fried buffalo wings, sliders, shrimp quesadilla, cheese fries, guacamole and ranchero salsa. The lemon pepper wings were awesome! Flavorful and hot with a nice char. The chipotle wings were tasty too; just the right amount of spice. I was so impressed by the burger...it was cooked perfectly! I usually don't do seafood and cheese but this quesadilla broke all the rules. Now, about the drinks...I originally ordered the lemon basil margarita. I looooove fresh herbs in my cocktail and was excited to try this cocktail only because of the basil. I was disappointed when I received the cocktail sans basil :(. I then decided to order the Gekko...again no fresh herbs :(. So I went with a simple mule...vodka, ginger beer, lime..it was perfect! We overall had great service and a great experience at QP Social! I can't wait for the brunch menu! Here's a run down of the good and the needs improvement.   The good: You can eat and drink in the bowling area  Tasty food Lots of room Good service  Kinks to work out: Booking for parties  Keeping fresh ingredients on hand for cocktails",

It's definitely a popular spot, we had a hard time finding an open space at the bar to order a drink.   We were able to order after a few minutes and my friend got the Aloe Vera Margarita and I got the Cousin Eddy. As soon as my friend put her mouth on her cup there was a long black hair connected to it that went in her mouth which is pretty gross. We told the bartender immediately and she apologized and started making a new drink. She didn't offer to comp the drink, instead she gave us these two really gross shots that we didn't take more than a sip of (she didn't even tell us what they were).  About 10 minutes after putting our name down we got a text saying our table was ready. We sat down ordered food and were served promptly. The food was good, nothing to write home about but definitely nothing to complain about. At the table I ordered a drink that I can't remember the name of now but it was pink and came in a wine glass and my friend got a beer because she didn't want to risk another hair in her drink.  Overall it was a good experience and it's a cute place. I wish they served all of their drinks in glass cups as opposed to plastic because I feel like that cheapens an otherwise really gorgeous space.",

One of the servers was extremely unprofessional and made a comment about our table to the table next to us when their food was delivered. They had arrived a good bit after us and had placed a very similar food order, although much later. When their food was delivered, the server asked them if they knew our table, and when they said no, told them that they could tell us to \"F#ck off.\"  We had spoken with this table during our hour-plus wait for appetizers, and they told us about the server's comment after he left. I've never experienced anything like it. I will say that the manager seemed like a nice guy and offered to comp our drinks after we told him we were leaving.",

We had to chase down servers for everything...to order, to get refills on drinks and multiple times to check where our meal was. It seemed like the place had million people working there but no one was doing anything, just wandering around. It was a terrible first impression for myself and my family from NY.

    "text": "I came to meet friends tonight around 8pm. There were multiple bar seats open, so I took a spot. I was looking up, had my credit card out and in view...obviously I needed service. Two male bartenders walked by me a total of 5 times (one passed me by 3 times, the other 2 times). I then moved further to the apex of the bar. The three bartenders, including 1 female, never looked at me or asked me if I needed service. They stood at the apex of the bar talking amongst themselves. It was not until I moved yet again, and stood up, and made my presence even more clear that one of the bartenders came to wait on me. He seriously acted like it was a chore, similar to carrying trash out, to wait on me. I am always neatly dressed, I wear appropriate makeup and other attire.  Even 3 hours later, I am still appalled that no one seemed to give a crap.  He said \"can I help you?\"  I said \"yes you can, as I've been sitting here for 15+ minutes watching all 3 of you walk by and do nothing.\"  He rolled his eyes. I was in no way, shape, or form intoxicated or acting out of line. This was my first trip to the bar. I will NEVER go back to this establishment again. Those servers should not only feel ashamed, but also feel guilty for the service that I received. I have never in my life been treated like that. The bar was not busy at all!!  Awful customer service and very poor establishment. To the managers:  get some new staff that gives a crap and actually enjoys working for tips!!",

She totally ignored me... so much to the point that I even tapped the register that she was at which was right in front of me. All I was trying to ask her was if the kitchen was open!! Even when I tapped the register she STILL ignored me. She said I HAD TO WAIT A MINUTE!! She walked away and said she would be right back... BUT NEVER came back. She continued to serve the other people around me. Not sure why she chose NOT to service me but to serve two other people on both sides of me. I will say this.. Customer service is customer service! I am a waitress myself and irregardless who the customer is ...you serve them to the best of your ability! I wasn't drinking, disrespect or belligerent! I only had a question!! Nevertheless this is a reflection on HER and NOT Queens Park Social.. it did put a damper on my night but I'm mature enough to known that my words have power!! So this review should serve it's purpose! Funny thing about it.. you never know who you come in contact with on the job and the affect you can have on a person.. I am a BIG tipper and so are the people I surround myself with .. so with that being said ,she missed out on a $50 tip just because she couldn't spare 2 seconds to answer a question! #itpaystobekindatalltimes",

    "text": "Definitely not a good first impression.  We came over here for the first time on a rainy Sunday. I expected it to be quite full, but the place was only mildly to moderately full. We sat down and began to order our drinks and they were out of multiple beers. Our server advised us they had had a big day prior, so they were out of a lot of drinks. OK whatever, so we ordered something else.  We then ordered some food. Our food never came. We brought this to our servers attention and she didn't even seem to notice that we hadn't received our food. She told us it was never put in for some reason and she would take it off of our bill. We were very hungry and it was late, so we were annoyed we didn't get the chance to order something else. She then brought us our checks without asking us if we were finished.  The manager then came out to apologize and offered us a round of drinks. This was very kind of him. However, once we receive the drinks we realize they were all different drinks then we had ordered. Again, not a great first impression.  It didn't seem as though the bartenders any servers were communicating well. Getting a beer seemed like it took ages and was a hassle. At one point we just decided to go to the bar and order it they are because our server was nowhere to be found. The bartender asked us to find our server instead of offering to find her himself or offering to pour us a drink.  This place definitely has a lot of kinks to work out. I'm hesitant to return with such poor service when the place was not busy.  With that being said, I do think it is a nice space and will be very popular. I saw the bowling and shuffleboard prices and was very surprised you have to pay for shuffleboard. Maybe I was misunderstanding.  I will give them several months to work things out before considering returning.",

    "text": "After originally liking this place the first time I went, I have changed my mind completely. It's ok to have off nights, but what happened Saturday night was pretty awful.   Let me add, my friends and I are all respectful, humble, and friendly people. It isn't like we treat people bad to deserve this kind of service. We are ideal customers.   We came with a large group of friends and spent quite a bit of money, so with that being said, I think we deserve to be treated respectfully. Whether we spent $1 or $500, we were there supporting the business.   We sat on the patio and a waiter came to ask us if we wanted food. He gave us a full menu and proceeded to tell us that they were on a \"late night menu\" only, which consisted of basically only appetizers. No biggie! We then ordered our food. He returned to tell us that the kitchen was out of cheese, and everything we ordered had cheese, so we had to select other items. He said \"I'll give you a couple of minutes to look over the menu, and will be back shortly\". Ok fine. He NEVER came back. Not even once. Finally, my husband tracked him down about 25 minutes later and he proceeded to tell my husband he had \"too many hours, and they cut him loose.  You can go order at the bar\"  Wow, thanks for coming back and letting us know!   So, we went to the bar and ordered chicken wings.  They told my husband that we could order quesadillas too. My husband came back to the table, let our friends know that our waiter abandoned us and we had to order at the bar.  They went to order, the bar told them the kitchen was closed.   So they brought the food door my husband and I, and the quesadillas had CHEESE. Even better for me! We asked for ranch, they said they ran out.   The entire place inside smelled like horse manure.   Then, they decided to close early, even though their listed hours are until 2:00am. And guess who was STILL there cleaning? The waiter who said he was cut loose hours ago!   One of our friends went to speak to the manager, and he basically said it was all out of his control and shrugged everything off.   There were employees on the patio, talking shit to us.   Like I said, everyone has a bad night, but this was one of the worst experiences I've had! Maybe with change of management, it will trickle down to the rest of the staff, and they could possibly turn it around.",

    "text": "The word of the day ladies and gentlemen is \"TASTEFUL\"!   Queen Park Social is new the area and the Charlotte community should welcome them with open arms! The spacious layout provides a full service bar, bowling lanes (approx 6 could be more) and a \"social\" area where you can enjoy some adult playtime. The hostess and servers were super friendly and while I was waiting on a drinks another waitress stopped by just to confirm that we'd been taken care of (I hope they keep that up).   I say go for one of their signature drinks (dancing Bear is my new fav). Keep in mind, the signature drinks will be about $10-$12. But if you're not really into mixed drinks then they have good selection of local brews on tap; averaging $5-$8.   The food was AMAZING... and I'm seriously not just saying that. I literally picked up my side bowl of rice to make sure I got it all. The food was reasonably priced also... I had a wrap and side for my main entree and that was about $12. Not bad for a simple Saturday lunch. But no one warned me that it would be that tasteful, I mean it wasn't just grilled chicken thrown on a wrap... it was SEASONED grilled chicken on a wrap.  Since the weather was so nice, I decided to order a dessert (weather has nothing to do with me wanting a dessert but whatever). Order the Apple Pie Taquitos.... comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cinnamon apple chips... you will thank me later!   I can't wait to come back for happy hour!",

    "text": "The games here are really fun and there's a good variety of food/drink/entertainment, but the costs of each of those can add up quickly. Things like jenga, uno, and dart, are all complementary, but if you wanted to play something more serious like Shuffleboard, Bowling, or even Skee Ball, plan to pay for it. They also have a good number of TVs around, so if you're just looking for a fun place to hang to watch the game, it's a pretty good spot for that.  The draft beer selection here is pretty good with a lot of local CLT and NC brews. Most drafts will run from $5-7 and bottles $4+. The only thing is that your tab does not translate from bar to bar, so if you open a tab at the main bar, you need to keep going back there, or close out that tab before you order a drink anywhere else in the place. Not the most convenient.",

The cocktails were roughly $10-14.    Purse hooks at the bar = great. Also the chairs at the bar are comfy, not just stools, they have a back! Haha. I feel old writing that as part of my review, but whatever.   We ordered the trio dip with guac, salsa and queso. Honestly, I didn't eat the salsa, but guac and queen were delicious.   Also, sweet potato fries always a great choice. The avocado blt wrap is also delicious.",

    "text": "So it's Friday night, I just want to lay in bed but my friend calls me up and says \"let's go out, we need to stop living boring lives\"  my face exactly Lolol I'm not boring to me, but I digress. Nevertheless her wife told her about this place and wants to go, so I bite bc I haven't seen them in a while and we always have a good time.  So let's start with location and parking, so this is within Charlotte and to park, it only took less than 5 mins to find parking on the curb and there is a parking lot but it was pretty full by the time I got there which was around 7:30.  Bonus #1 there was no charge to get in so it's a pretty active environment and when we arrived a live band was setting up! We go to the bar bc my friends had an agenda, DRINK! Lolol I was there to only drink water but of course they couldn't have that so they asked what I like and I said vodka cranberry and I got a mandarin vodka with cranberry, it was poured awesomely! Didn't skimp on the liquor at all. I also got am Angry Orchard on tap, which i drank with a straw, YES A STRAW Lolol The bar itself is a half circle with plenty of room and TVs around it and we ordered food which were cheese fries and steak tacos! OMG the steak tacos were SO flavorful and chock full of items and it was $14 for 3 and a plate FULL of fries!! After the tacos I was STUFT so the fries I had to take to go.  Now that we had been watered and fed lol it was time to explore the rest of the venue. Our first stop was outside where they had a patio that had warmers on it and very nice patio furniture and a ping pong table. That's where people mainly go to smoke as you are not supposed to smoke inside. Then my friend wanted to play pool really had so we went back in and played a game of pool which I believe was $1.00 per game, btw I won  lol there are two pool tables and an area to play Jenna which we also did, I lost Lolol wasn't bad for my first time tho! I'm short so as it got taller, it got difficult lol Also in this same area they had a table with HUGE playing cards and Uno Cards and we played a few rounds of UNO which was VICIOUS Lolol but no seriously, we all know when those draw 4s come out to play, whole relationships are tested!!  There is a shuffle board there and something (I'll describe it for you) where there are balls and it's a lane and people were rolling and hitting the balls against each other. My friends and I didn't really know what they were doing or the game. If you know, let me know bc maybe I can learn to play lol  the bar splits the two areas so we leave that area to the live band area and there's also tables and lounge furniture along with two arcade basketball hoops which we played! That's always fun!!! My friend missed 9/10 shots Lolol she was tired of losing by the end of the night lol I know you all have that one friend that can't lose lol but nevertheless the band was pretty cool and the atmosphere was very chill and positive. There is of course loud music playing but they played good songs and it wasn't unbearable. Bathrooms and overall environment was clean and we maintained.  The only thing that was slightly confusing was at the bar, they kind of rotated so i didn't know if we had one bartender or if they were all supposed to be serving us.  My friend had a moscow mule (idk if i spelled that right) and an old fashioned and she loved them both! Her wife had a couple of concoctions she made up and they were very accommodating so if you like that, definitely try it! We stayed from 7:30pm-11pm and really enjoyed ourselves.  Overall, I see myself not only going back but bringing out of town guests there to enjoy a night of fun.",

    "text": "I dropped into Queen Park Social on a Sunday afternoon to check it out and grab lunch.  We walked in around 12 p.m. to an almost empty venue.  Fortunately, that made for very quick seating in the dining area.  You can order food in the dining area, the bar, the game rooms and the outdoor patio.    The menu is diverse bar food - salads, burgers, tacos.  We ordered a cobb salad with steak and a big burger.  The food did take a while to come out, especially considering there weren't any other tables ordering food at the time.  But, it was very tasty.  The steak on my salad was a generous portion and cooked a perfect medium rare.  The burger was also cooked a perfect medium and and included a big slice of queso fresca and guacamole - yum!  Our server, who only had one table, hovered a bit but that should shake out with more experience and more tables.    The patio looked great - maybe 12 tables, some with shade.  Dogs are welcome to lounge on the patio with their people.    The bar has 18 taps - many of which were empty after a busy Saturday night.  There were maybe 6 dedicated to local taps - I'd love to see that increased.  There's also a full bar option with plenty of specialty cocktails.   We weren't there to play games this time, but the area looked fun - albeit smaller than I imagined.  There's an 8-lane bowling alley, 2 shuffleboards, and a couple of pool tables.  It's a neat idea - but I'd like to see the practicality of it on a busy night.  Seems like a relatively few number of people could overpower the game space, but I could be completely off on that.  Overall, great addition to LoSo!",

We got there early to get a good place to sit but it wasn't busy at all.  We were about 10 min out from the game starting and we asked the bartender if they would put the game on.  They said sure and walked away.  It was now kick off time and none of the many TV's had the game on.  We had to ask again for them to air the game.  Very disappointed in the fact they advertised this and yet didn't have the game on.    Also, don't ask for the free, guest internet because they don't know the password or won't give it to you.    Food was mediocre as well.    Very let down by this experience and doubt we will be back or recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "First and last time at this establishment. Apathetic and under-achieving service by all four servers I saw wandering the side of the restaurant I was sitting. Even though I was sitting and actively looking at a menu (that I had to get up and retrieve) not one of the servers walking by stopped to ask if I wanted to order anything. I finally hailed one of them and asked her if she was working this section. She replied with a nod of her head and an \"unfortunately\" look on her face. I asked for the Steak Wrap but was told they were out of steak. O.k., I asked her to give me a few minutes while I relooked the menu. However, I did want a beer and a water; which I ordered. She never came back. About 15 minutes later I was able to catch her eye. Ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with regular fries and \"reordered\" the beer and water she never brought. She said she needed a card. I always pay cash and do not like handing over my bank or credit cards. However, seeing how busy it was with the game fans, I understood and gave her a card.  Waited another 15-20 minutes, still no water or beer. Another employee, a guy with a bun, was speaking to someone else at the long table. As he started to walk away I said \"excuse me\". He reluctantly came over. Seriously, no customer service by any of them. No smile, no thank you, no-nothing! Baffles me. I politely and nicely, asked him if he could find out where my beer and water was, then thanked him. He looked at me, never said a word and walked away. About 10 minutes later I saw him walking into a side room with what I assume was his dinner. How nice! Someone got food and drink! Never got my beer and told her to take it off the check when she came back later. No apology for never bringing it. My sandwich came out with brown fries. Yes, I am aware that one side of the fry has the skin attached. All of the fries were brown. At first I thought perhaps they gave me sweet potato fries by mistake. No, they were just brown, soggy and cold. The sandwich was pounded so thin that it was overcooked and all I could taste was the buffalo sauce. The bleu cheese I asked for when I ordered, was not delivered with the food. I would like to mention here that there was ONE PERSON that I encountered, the young guy who brought out the food, who had a smile on his face, was pleasant and happily brought me the bleu cheese I ordered. A shame he is stuck back in the kitchen. When I I finally asked for my check, she brought it to me and then said she had to find a pen. I said, I didn't need one. I was paying cash. However, she had already charged my card without asking if that was how I wanted to pay. Then tells me it may take up to ten days for the refund to show up on my account. Such an unpleasant experience. Far too many cool places to spend my money in Charlotte to settle for this mess. Unhappy, apathetic, low-energy employees; make for unhappy customers.",

Sat and sat and sat ignored over and over and over again by many staff members who walked past and NEVER offered to bring a menu or take a drink order.  HELLO?  We have money to spend here?!?!  Finally one of us went over to the bartender and asked if we needed to order our drinks at the bar or would we be served by a server?  No - a server will come take our order,   Well, after another 15 minutes we gave up and went back to the bar and ordered and paid for our first round of drinks, sat down and eventually a server did show up.  We ordered some wings and chips and queso.  Some dude brought the food, dropped it on the table and left.  No napkins, no silverware.  Service was terribly lacking.  We had to flag down our waitress for a napkin.  And then we went BACK up to the bar ourselves for the 2nd round of drinks.  They were not that busy -it was Wednesday night.  But either the staff needs some serious training or they to get more staff on the floor?  No mangement in sight.  Very expensive drink prices and the food was not great.  Chips were awful.  Plenty of better places to go for food and drinks for sure - great entertainment concept but just not worth the prices and lack of service - especially not in this town.",

Server took a very long time to visit us, take orders.  Waited about 10-15 minutes for drinks to come.  I got the Moscow Mule equivalent and it was not very good at all.  Then the LONG WAIT.  Chips and Guacamole took forever and a half to come.  Chips were pretty bad and guacamole didn't appear fresh.  Tacos came out shortly after.  All in - the service was extremely poor and slow.  Again, this was a Tuesday Evening when the establishment was not crowded at all!!  Management is either not present or does not care about customers - which is shocking for a new spot.   Food quality was 3/10 and overall experience was negative.  If you're looking for a good time there are plenty of other options on Yancey Road.",

    "text": "If you ever want to just feel like a big kid, you will LOVE this place!   My sister and I needed something to eat after completing an escape room next door. We did not want to drive far so we opted to check out this spot. We stopped in around 8:30 on a Monday night.there was ample parking. Likely because there were not a ton of patrons.  For some reason my sister prefers bar seating, so to the bar we went! First thing to note- the smell of this place is interesting. I don't really know how to accurately describe it, but it's not pleasurable. We agreed to still check out the menu. Nicole was our host/ bar tender. What a beautiful spirit. She was very friendly and I gathered that she enjoyed her job. She helped us pick a few items from the menu. We opted  for the turkey meatballs and truffle Fries. The other staff members were friendly and helpful. One guy picked up a game for us and provided us with a lesson on how to play.   The food arrived in decent time.  The turkey meatballs were served over a few green pieces and in a cute dish. The taste of the meatballs was decent. The fries were just mediocre. I did not taste the truffle at all. They were more Parmesan fries than truffle. After enjoying our meal we had to check out the rest of the space.  The actual re area is the score for me. They offer a number of games from giant connect four to jenga to basketball and darts.some of the arcade like games do require money. I played the boxing  game for $1.00. The other patrons were friendly and engaging. This is a place where it makes you feel like family. I personally would love to have my birthday party or a group of friends meet up at this spot! It would be endless fun!   Summary- food is decent, games, atmosphere and service are the winning tickets!!",

Never been here but I knew it was similar to the one near my house called piedmont social house and I love it there so I figure I would love it here just as much. A great place to go and eat, have a drink or two and just be a big kid playing the games they offer. They have everything to the oversized checkers, Jenga, video games, bowling, pool tables, and some games I never even heard of before, but I had a blast playing. The only thing off here is the smell when you come in i can't really explain it but it's like an old building smell that the floors was mopped with old dirty water. Yet we still gave them a chance because we were won over from the employees and the excitement of looking around and seeing all the games.   The menu was quite simple and to the point, which I appreciated at this point because we were starved and ready to grub. We both ordered the turkey meatballs with truffle fries. To my surprise the turkey meatballs filled me up and they were good on top of it all. The truffle fries ehh were okay I have had better. My drink of coarse was a grapefruit cocktail which I enjoyed every bit of as well. So if you ever have a moment where you just wanna be a big kid and enjoy drinks and food while doing so this is another place of business I recommend.",

    "text": "It's a Wednesday night, the place is practically empty and it still took about 10 minutes for someone to notice we were standing by the door waiting to be seated. Do you seat yourself at Queen Park? I'm a first-timer, actually, most of the women I was with also were, so we patiently waited.   Finally, we sat, and our waiter greeted us. He was a friendly guy and brought waters to our table promptly. Things seemed to be picking up. After checking out the menu, we placed our drink orders, but one after another the drinks we requested weren't in stock. As a cider drinker, our waiter suggested another cider and I agreed to give the alternative a shot. When he came back, everyone else had their bevs expect for me. He said he didn't hear me. *eye roll* So, he came back minutes later with my drink.   Before placing our orders a friend mentioned that she is gluten-free and asked if they have a GF menu. They don't but the chef can accommodate, said our waiter.  With that, we placed our orders. The food came out centuries later, or so it felt like that. With my GF friend her salad had croutons on it...nope. She sent it back, and the salad came back a little too quickly for me to think they re-made it rather than just plucking the croutons off the salad.   Sadly, the food was nothing spectacular. I ordered the nachos and as a vegetarian, I firmly believe that veggies should be added for free or a reasonable additional charge, not $3. The nachos were weak and soggy with the amount of cheese poured over the chips.   I can't say I will be coming back to Queen Park Social for a dining experience, but I will come to an event or maybe to partake in games. With the level of service we received when the joint was dead, I can't fathom what the service would be like when this place is hopping on the weekends.",

They don't open until 4 so it's not like you can find out ahead of time  It wasn't closed when we got there, but they started setting up for an event about an hour later. They set it up around us and didn't kick is out but it was kind of awkward to be sitting at a table in the middle of an event you aren't part of.   I also wish that you could play some if the games for free. You can play board games, but it seemed like you had to pay for everything else.   I've had the food which isn't bad, but also isn't great.

My only issue is that I paid s different price for the same drink depending on the bar I went too.  Don't think that is right, so that is my only ding on the operation.    Had a great time, but felt a little cheated.",

But the food and servers are awesome. The lobster was cooked perfectly.. And staffs was there to assisted us in every step of the way.. And our chef came out with baskets and baskets of shrimp, red potatoes, corns and sausages that we couldn't keep up.. I really enjoy these type of events. You meet new people and I'm glad I wasn't the only one who didn't know how to crack open a whole lobster. If they host some kind of events like this again. Count me it. It was awesome!",

My boyfriend had the cheeseburger flatbread which really was just bread and some bbq sauce.  Bowling was great though! You couldn't hear all the pins and bowling balls anywhere in the building except when bowling. Really put some money into the noise barriers. I spent about 2.5 hours people watching, bowling and having a beverage. There are lots of activities but crowded is crowded. It seems spacious in some areas but others are tightly packed and it gets warm quick.  The crowd was both young and old. A good mix of demographics overall but a little heavier on the hipster grouping. Something different for a night with friends but maybe not for a date.",

They also have tons of other games like Skee Ball, Air Hockey, and Shuffleboard which have a charge and then some complimentary like Darts, Life Sized Jenga, and Life Sized Connect Four. This last time I came for drinks and decided to grab some food. Our bartender Rob was great. I first ordered the Carolina Mule (which Rod didn't make) and I didn't like it at all. That's when I got Rob's attention to let him know I didn't like it, he grabbed a little straw to taste it and seen what I was talking about and remade it, it tasted much better but still wasn't a big fan and realized it was due to the type of whiskey used.  When trying to decide what to eat, Rob suggested the steak wrap and I'm so good I decided to give it a try because it was so good. The goat cheese and pineapples with the steak was everything. He also mentioned that they have a new kitchen staff because I have read not so good reviews regarding the food but it wasn't my experience this time. My fires did come out cold tho but Rob got them replaced immediately and they were really good and seasoned well.",

They have a game side of the space where you can play shuffleboard, pop n' shot basketball, giant jenga, foosball, etc. They've got a bowling section where you can reserve lanes and shoes and play a few frames with your friends. Then they've got a larger bar area connected to a restaurant/seating area and all of that next to a nice outdoor patio drinking area.  They've really got it all.  Drink and food prices aren't unreasonable and they're both pretty good quality!  I've also had a work event here on the restaurant/table side of the space and it was very well run.

This could be partially due to the fact that they are a new establishment, however that does not excuse the lack of service delivery execution. Upon visiting for the very first time, I walked up to the bar and ordered the Gekko. The bartender was very friendly and acknowledged my order, but 10 minutes later after waiting at the bar and seeing others receive a drink before me, I politely asked if mine would be coming up soon, she apologized and said she forgot to make my drink, which was not a big deal since it was the weekend. Then she went on to explain that it was her first day on the job (on a Saturday!?!?!) and she needed to look up the recipe even though it was in the menu. After receiving my drink, I had to remind her that I needed to pay for my order which took another few minutes.   Later in the evening we were seated (table of 5), and a different waitress took our order. We called out which menu items we wanted as appetizers and which ones as main entrees. She took down our order and did not return for another 30 minutes. We asked if the appetizers would be coming out soon, and she said she would check on them. However we noticed that she walked to the back to enter our order. She completely forgot to put in our order! Second time tonight this happened! Eventually a different waitress came to our table to give us an order of cold cheese fries, which we're not acceptable. A manager later came over and our group explained that we waited close to 45 minuets just  for 3 wing orders and two burgers, and only received cold fries. The manager apologized and took the cold fries, offering drinks in exchange, however we declined and asked to at least have an appetizer. By the time an hour passed, we finally received our food ( even though some of the orders were mixed up) and our cheese fries never returned.   This is unfortunately the poorest review I've posted on Yelp thus far. I am rating them two stars since my orders were lost twice in one night, all of my food came out cold and late, and my appetizer never returned. I love the atmosphere of this place which is why they are receiving two stars, but they need to hire more seasoned workers for non-beer customers who wish to sit down and eat.",

However this time, there were people at the bar (that looked overserved on the multiple shots I watched them down) that started VAPING!!! OMG....I couldn't believe my eyes. It is 2017 and we STILL allow this poor behavior??? When I asked a server to have the man go outside to smoke, he came back to tell me that it IS allowed inside there. Then I asked for the owner, the manager came over, I expressed my concerns and she said \"Its legal\"! When you or someone you are with that has lung issues (Cancer, Cystic Fibrosis, Asthma, COPD, just to name a few) and cannot be around smoke or for those of us that don't want to secondhand smoke your bad habit.... stay far away from this place. I told them they have lost my business until they change this policy and that I will spread the word to everyone I know. Because as far as I am concerned they are discriminating against ALL of the people that don't want to deal with the smoke to save a few people from having to step outside!! Smoking has been banned inside for a reason, do you really want to subject your clientele to vaping to find out it was just as dangerous as a cigarette???? Step up and do the right thing so we ALL can enjoy and help make your business a success!!",

My 3 yr old daughter loves it and so do my friends' kids.  We adults get to watch NFL while having a fun time with the kids - a win-win I haven't been able to find elsewhere.  I've been to Queen Park for a party and the private event space was pretty cool, too.  One time we had some difficulty getting the wait staff to pay attention to us, but I let management know and they corrected the situation and we haven't had the problem again.

Over the past 2 months we have had a group of people go to Queen Park Social for the advertised trivia that they supposedly do on Wednesday nights.  Out of the 5 times we have gone, they have actually only had it 2 of the times.  What really put us over the edge this week is the fact that we called yesterday at 3:30 and spoke to someone named Allison who confirmed they were doing trivia last night only to find out when our large group got there that they weren't having trivia.  It's incredibly frustrating to organize a group to get together at your restaurant around an event only to get there an not be able to participate.  Needless to say, we took our group to the breweries around QPS rather than give you any of our business last night.",

I can understand that may be overwhelming but the place was empty. Tables had dirty plates on them. Knew that was probably not a good sign. Took 30 minutes to get water. They kept telling us our server was coming soon. Another 20 minutes and he walked around our table to i.d. Everyone. we are all 40's and above but he was doing his job, I guess. He then came back around to finally get our drink order. At this point several of our table had already gone to get a drink at the bar. Drinks took 30 minutes at least. THEN he finally took our food order. Another 45 minutes for food. He would bring 2 plates at a time in 10 minute intervals. Where was back up for this guy? I talked to a manager who looked all of 21. He says he's so sorry and get this, he tells me when we asked where our server was, the manager says they had to go find him in the bathroom. What?!  Manager offered an apology but never stepped in to help the guy, comp food, nothing! Our bill comes after tracking our server down. Another 30 minutes. Dirty plates on our table, no water refills. AND the server puts an automatic 20%. I know that is customary for a large table ( usually 18% though), so I lost it. At this point, the whole table is just over it. I talked to another manager and he offers to refund our automatic tip. And that our server would need all of our credit cards back to do so. What?! The server asked me what went wrong. Management needs to step up and train and do a better job of customer service. We will not be back.",

Bars pin different locations, outdoor seating, shuffleboard, bowling...yes bowling!  Basketball game, giant jenga, dancing, food, beer wine, mixed drinks and shots were flying.  Great times here.    I was on the older side of the normal crowd. The group I was with ranged from 22 to 56. Boy oh boy those in their 20's....it's perfect. Well it's great for any age if you have the right attitude.

The parking lot can get full quickly but there's also street parking so you shouldn't have any problems . Walking in the first time I don't remember being greeted but the second time we came back in there was a lady  at the front desk who spoke to us and handed us wrist bands . I thought the bartender was a bit rude when I asked him a question and when people were trying to order. It seems like he overcharged us as well but he didn't seem interested in explaining. We've order the 12 wings for $14 dollars but was charged $17 and some change . He simply said \"it was tax\" or something like that. Charlotte tax does not add 3 dollars to a bill. The receipt didn't show the break down either. He also screwed his face up when I questioned him. We've have no problem paying for things just like to know what it is. The bar area was busy so maybe he was overwhelmed but still, be pleasant as well were all pleasant to you and my friend still tipped after his response to me.  Outside of that , the concept is cool. We didn't  go bowling but I'll come back for that. I definitely want to try again . Hopefully my review will change .  The wings are slamming btw lol",

Their pins are held up with some sort of string system that, we think, affects the ability of the ball to knock more pins over.   This was the first time we had ever seen this sort of setup.  But, we had a blast anyway.  The service at the lanes was phenomenal, and so were the food and cocktails.   After a round of bowling we then progressed to the shuffle board and spent another hour or more continuing our night of fun.  I really enjoy how the atmosphere seems to be one that isn't catering to children who can really annoy the adults who need social time with their friends.  I'm very excited about this place, and I plan on coming back many more times.  Also, the bathrooms are very clean and the staff are all-around hospitable.",

Honestly, the only reason I had to drop them to 4 stars was because my drink was just \"ok\". I got an old fashioned and if I'm getting a classic it must be up to par at minimum. They have a lot of other great cocktails that I'd like to try next time though. Also a lot of great local beers on tap.   We went there for bowling and it was pretty darn expensive. Especially for a Tuesday. I was with a group and we usually go to the AMF for $2 per game on Tuesdays but they were full due to some league play that night. The bowling lanes here are quite small. It's not extremely noticeable because they did a pretty great job of successfully squeezing 8 lanes into such a small space. Price aside, we had a great time. On to the food.  I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a couple apps. I got the Brussel sprouts and the grilled lemon pepper wings and they were both amazing! Actually some of the best lemon pepper wings I've ever had. They also had some of the best looking chicken tenders. Very little breading and all breast meat. Can't wait to try them.",

I ordered one of the specials the watermelon margarita/ it comes frozen and cost me $9. I love margaritas and this one was potent and they didn't use bottom shelf tequila.

I wasn't impressed enough to review and waited another year to return.   During this visit we had a group of about 25 people. There were about 16 people from the group that decided to bowl. The rest including myself just watched and socialized. We were able to use the first two lanes close to the wall.   Halfway through the games one of the lanes broke. It took a while for them the fix the lane. Since the lane was broken someone from our group went and spoke with the staff. The guy initially gave us ten more minutes to each lane's bowling time. After my friend went back and spoke to some one they added 20 more minutes to the broken lane.   It was a Monday night and the place wasn't packed. Not all the lanes were even in use. So I feel like they could have done a lot better with accommodating our group and taking care of us. No one from Queens Park came over to assist us, we had to go and look for a staff member.   If a large group of friends go back I will probably join but I will never initiate an outing there.   Queen Park Social 4125 Yancey Rd Charlotte, NC 28217 Monday February 25, 2019 8:30pm",

We didn't bowl as it was crowded, and the game area was over run with hipsters and college kids not really playing anything, just taking up space.    The outside area is nice, but lacks any relevant seating, but did boast a ping pong table and darts.    Beer and drinks are overpriced, and it smells like a crowded club - you know that wonderful sweat, spoiled beer on the floor and urine mixed in together.  Compared to Sugar Creek, OMB, and the distillery, this place seems overtly trendy versus unique for the area.  If I wanted to go to an uptown bar, I'd drive uptown.  We probably won't go back when there is OMB and sugar creek across the street.",

    "text": "Having been to other similar venues, I would say that there is room to grow for this venue in terms of game variety and clear price posting for things like bowling. That being said, it was a great end to our bar hopping in the area. Also note that Sunday evenings they have unlimited bowling plus shoes for $5 a person. Only limited by availability and you play in two hour blocks.  The bar was well stocked and the cocktails were well made. I had the rum based signature cocktail and was pleased by the taste. Price is a little on the higher end but normal for the area.   Bowling was pretty fun though there are some strange elements such as the pins being on strings, the approach seemingly a little shorter than regulation, and a strange oil pattern that sent balls hooking to the left quite often. However for the price, it worked!   After bowling for 1.5 hours, we played the over-sized Jenga . It was a ton of fun, though I wish the barrel table we utilized was a tad bit shorter to accommodate the growing tower. It made the game difficult a little difficult for my friends.  Overall a spot with lots of potential and solid drinks!",

They have all sorts of games to play, bowling, etc. They also have plenty of places to sit, both inside and outside. However, the service and food was sub par. When we walked in, we were not greeted but were asked to show ID. We were then give bracelets to wear. We then walked around and decided we wanted to get a table so we can order some food. We were told we could sit at the high tops near the bar. We had to go up to the hostess stand to get menus and waited a good 15-20 minutes before a waitress came by. We both ordered a Queen Park Mule, which was just a standard Moscow Mule. It was good but nothing out of this world. We also decided to order chicken nachos and asked for them with the corn and sour cream on the side. We were told \"not a problem\". The nachos came out fairly quickly but had the corn and sour cream on it. These were probably the worst nachos I ever had in my life. Flavorless, soggy and just not good. I don't think I'd ever come back here but we will see.",

    "text": "For my first time eating at QPS this visit wasn't pleasant. It started out good but our food service was not what I expected at all.  When we arrived there was a wait as we needed majority of our party to be present. Though there was absolutely no one in the dining area, and I mean no one. But no biggie we waited and check out the space. Once our guest arrived we were taken to the dining area. They had great board games, large TVs and a huge bocce ball area. The last time I was here they had a private room, but it looked like they had removed it.   We started off with a few appetizers at 5:45pm and played a few of the games while we waited for more of our guest to arrive. Around 6:15pm we started ordering our food. Of course I was check yelp photos to see what everyone had enjoyed here, even though the rating isn't so high. The one time that I was here it was for yoga and we had chicken strips and fries.   Once our orders were completed our server Sam bought out drinks and my cup had lipstick on it. He apologized and said he would bring another one for me. We waited for nearly an hour before our food came out. The kids received their food first, then slowly, and I mean SLOWLY the adults entrees came. But of course when it arrived everyone's food was warm or cold. Some are there's anyway because they were hungry and other returned there's. But the funny thing is, those that returned there's the food came back out faster than the original order. Myself and my mother were the last to receive our food. I had a burger that was not cooked medium rare {not event a hint of pink} but we well done. I know some restaurants aren't allowed to do this, however I noticed it wasn't the case here from the yelp photos. Which is why I requested a medium rare burger. Not only that I had the smallest amount of fries ever.   I'm not really sure of the reason for the lack of attention and slow food service that took place at Queen Park Social. It's as if they didn't care and took their precious time.",

They double charged me for a drink and were rude when I brought this to their attention before they corrected it. The burger I ordered had amazing potential as well but came out dry as could be.

The only downside is that you have to pay for most of the games. I guess that's to be expected.",

While we waited, she explained the menu and the schedule, and gave us information about the other games and activities we could do in the meantime. After getting us onto a lane, she came over multiple times while we were bowling to make sure we were okay and that our waiter was taking care of us. I will go back and see Porsche any chance I get!

We flagged our waitress down when we were ready and she told us to wait a minute (almost in a rude tone). We finally ordered and after almost an hour still hadn't received our food. Someone from our party made a joke about getting our food like another table nearby and our waitress again made a snarky comment about how our food should be out shortly. We asked if there was a manager around and then we were brought a free appetizer once they realized we were upset. When the food finally came it was lukewarm and not that great.

Upon grabbing a seat, we had to ask for menus, which took several minutes to receive. After taking a look I was definitely disappointed with the drink selections, very limited. We ordered some drinks and water, which we never received. We decided to grab some food, which then took a while to flag someone down to place our order.  Keep in mind the place was not too crowded with several seats still open at the bar. We ordered the Chicken Fingers and Fries and the Shrimp Tacos.  Once the food arrived we had to ask for silverware/napkins and again water. Finally we received water. The chicken fingers were good, but so greasy! However, the regular fries, loved! They had a seasoning salt that was the kicker to a perfectly cooked fry! As for the tacos, they were basically lettuce with four pieces of shrimp, not impressed at all. We didn't bowl, but I would love to come back to hit the lanes. Overall, I had hoped for more, but will definitely give them another shot and update my review if there have been any improvements.",

The drinks have always been good (exactly as ordered), and the serving staff and bartenders have been nice (albeit, one or two of them are a little young, aloof, and not really customer service oriented).  It is a fun place, and a great addition to the breweries in the area.   So, overall, it is a great place.    The star deduction is food related.  Like some of the others, it took a LONG time to get our food.  We simply ordered cheese and charcuterie.   Honestly, it was awful.  If I didn't think that it would have embarrassed my friend, I would have taken pictures and sent it back.   The meats were cubes!! of ham, and too thick slices of salami with the plastic (you could read the writing on some slices).  The fruit was old, like a day-old side of fruit at a pancake house - with unfresh melon, canned pineapple chunks and shriveled blueberries.  And the cheese meh - nothing really flavorful, and not very much of it.   This is the EASIEST dish to get right.   Just a huge disappointment, and definitely turned me off of ordering food again.    I will be back for bowling and some drinks, though.   Fun place that would be AWESOME with a better kitchen.",

We explain that we weren't the ones making her cry and she told us it was because her manager was a \"d***\" He stated it wasn't him she was referring to but he knew which manager it was. They really need to get their staff and management under control. I couldn't believe the entire interaction. The concept of the place is great. Hopefully, they make some changes in their staff for a positive turnaround. I'd like to go back and not feel like the staff is part of some high school \"first jobs\" reality show.",

    "text": "The main thing that would bring up the rating of QPS is the service. I don't like to knock places for service, but after reading other reviews and experiencing the exact same thing myself, I get it. It's an issue, and it should be addressed. However, there's enough fun stuff to do everywhere that you don't really need too much distraction.  I came here for The Lady's birthday, along with her friend...and her parents...and our friends... it was a pretty large group. We started the day off with cornhole (god am I terrible at that game. I need some help. Anybody have the patience to help me and make me better?), and then we went onto shuffleboard - not table shuffleboard, the real kind, like the older people play on cruise ships! And yea, it's super fun. Don't judge. There were a few more games that we flirted with, skiball, darts, foosball, etc., but after that, we all kind of gathered around the bar for dinner and more drinks. The bar is a beautiful U shape, and there's tons of seating around it, and there are tables around that as well. We all got drinks and food - I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was not bad! Not great, but not bad at all. Sundays feature $2 mimosas which is a steal, and they're pretty potent too. Not bad, QPS.   One thing that really annoyed me was the lack of tab transfer throughout the building. I had to have three separate tabs - one for outside, one for inside, and one for when I was ordering food. A bartender even closed a tab for me, even though I didn't ask for it, although she never informed me and I had to hand over my card, yet again.  Getting the attention of anybody was a disaster. Nobody took care of us at the table, but we had to go to the bar. ... where nobody really acknowledged me for a solid 5 minutes, on multiple occasions. It was just kind of ridiculous. But as I said, there are enough distractions in there that it didn't bother me that much. I'd like to see what QPS is like on a Saturday, to see if you're able to even move. The space is big, but it wasn't particularly crowded on Sunday, which makes me more inclined to go on Sundays more often ;) I'll be back!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Queens Park Social; games, alcohol, and food all in one spot. However I cannot help but feel slightly disappointed after dining at QPS. Drinks (while very, very strong; perhaps a pro, perhaps a con depending on your preference) are overpriced and food is much of the same. I ordered the mesquite steak wrap, medium; after various negative experiences in my life going medium rare on steak, I've learned most places tend to undercook vs overcook. The food took a very long time to come out, the same was True for my party's drinks as well. The food was good, no doubt, but I couldn't help but ask myself \"was this 12th dollars good?\" No, is the conclusion I reached.   All of this was not insurmountable on my quest for an enjoyable experience however two things in particular proved to sink the ship of hope.  The first was service. While I am extremely quick to judge, I'm often right. It's a blessing and a curse. Our server was quite lackadaisical and inattentive; at one point after chugging down my \"The Dude\" (Tito's vodka, kahlua, some heavy cream; $9) he immediately appeared asking if I'd like another. After declining (someone has to be the designated driver) he walked off, ignoring the fact that everyone on my table needed water refills and neglecting to bus the empty glasses. I know this sounds petty but I feel like it was relatively emblematic of the attention we would (not) receive.   The second thing that took the wind out of my sails was the noise level. While I realize bringing this up may cause many to discount my review as pedantic and the ramblings of a living, walking, breathing wet blanket, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this place is LOUD. Just maybe something to consider.   Queens Park Social is a nice place; there are a lot of people who seem to be having a great time. Maybe going on a Saturday night wasn't the right move, I get that. I would probably consider giving it another shot. I can't really recommend it at this point for me though. I'm just one of 40-something reviews though. Hell, what do I know.",

I went on a sunday night and it was not very busy at all, the bar wasnt even half full. With that being said, it still took a really long time to order a drink. The margaritas were good, but oh my goodness, the Dancing Bear cocktail was by far the worst drink I have ever tasted in my life. It needs to be taken off the menu, everyone I was with tried some of mine and no one could drink it. It tasted like straight up cough syrup. My other friends got different cocktails on the menu and werent impressed either.   The chicken fingers were pretty good, and the bowling was fun. I would have given this place 4 stars, but the cocktails are very expensive to not even be halfway decent.",

There is a game room with table tennis and shuffle board and life size jenga. As for the food and drink, we ordered the nachos with salsa and guacamole as an appetizer and it was solid. We both went for the tacos as the main. She ordered shrimp and I got the pork. Both were amazing and full of lots deep flavors. The beer on tap has a lot of local breweries which is always a plus for me. Ross was so friendly and attentive and had some great suggestions for food and drink.

With my second beer he claimed he couldnt find me, even though I hadn't moved, and just left it on a table for me to find. The food was cold and sub-par. They came without labels so we had to guess what were in the sliders. The server preferred to chat it up with people instead of actually serving, particularly when they allowed people not in our group to come in and take over the one area. When our happy hour time was up, a young man came around and rudely said 'are you guys done because we need to clean up and your happy hour is over'.

    "text": "Food is pretty decent and drinks are average. The place is really awesome on the inside with a lot to do. There's a great front and back patio as well which we really enjoyed. Bartender was quick and super friendly.   Food service is awful and always has been. I'd give them 1 star in that category which is terrible since I'm the most low maintenance customer ever. We've been here 3 times and had to ask for service repeatedly in each case. We're told last night someone would help us and watched as a waitress walked past our table 4 times and didn't try to clean off the cups full of dip spit and tobacco from the previous group and all the beer glasses, plates etc. and there's only 3 tables outside so not like she just didn't see it. Asked her if she'd help us and she basically said she wasn't our server but would find one and brought us waters. Had to ask the hostess 20 minutes later for a server as well (who ended up being the original lady). She was so lifeless and slow we described her as being dead inside (maybe she was working a double... no idea). Food order has been messed up each time. Someone ordered 3 vegetarian tacos without cheese and got 2 tacos with steak and cheese. Even getting the beer pitcher delivered to the table took 30 minutes.   Sucks because it could be a really awesome place but I guess we'll start eating at OMB and then coming to play games if we come back",

    "text": "First of all the bartender did not write our order down. With that being said .. our order was completely WRONG! This place is toooo loud for the bartender to think its okay to take the order down with out taking it down or repeating it. We ordered 14 lemon pepper and received 8 buffalo and 8lemon pepper. We also ordered Fries but they did not come out. Then we are served the food that belongs to the people beside us!!   This company has a couple of bartender complaints. When I saw the reviews i decided to ignore the comments but there are all True!!!!!!   This place encourages people to socialize yet the music is as loud as a night club. Why advertise socialize and not provide the setting?  This place has potential but apparently the owners don't take the review serious because everything everyone complained about I experienced.   I gave three stars because the food was good",

They said they done have change so they just charge you an extra $1. They steal about 75-50 cents a beer from there guests. Idk what has changed but it's made me rethink of ever coming back because you can get a bigger sized cup same beer at OMB..... they failed tonight.",

    "text": "Went here during NFL playoffs and out of 20+ TVs only 1 (ONE!) had the game on. How does that even pass as a social club if the main social event of the night isn't even playing?! Not to mention the bartenders are ill-fit for a place billing itself as \"social\". One of them didn't utter a single word when ordering a drink -- he just pointed and grunted. Not friendly service in my books.  All in all lots of fun things to do here, but not much room to do them (surprisingly). It gets crowded and the games are taken by sundown (5pm in winter). Didn't try the food, but the menu looked tasty.",

The food is solid but the real star is the venue itself. The bowling adds a great new option in addition to the giant bar and other gaming areas.   My only issue is the speed of service but I know that will improve over time.   Certainly worth checking the place out and it's very easy to hang out here for ours.  One more thing, the pricing on the drinks is great! White Russians for $8 is great.",

The ladies who run the bowling lanes don't care if you don't know how the process works and won't take the time to explain it to you either. We just paid $70 and I don't even know what we paid for. Wouldn't give an itemized receipt and also showed me off when I tried to ask. I told her I wasn't planning on playing and she said \"I don't care\" multiple times and rolled her eyes at me. Some party took over all the seating and most of the lanes so we had nowhere to put our things. People were in our lane the whole time. It was a truly terrible experience. Will not be returning and will definitely not recommend this place to our friends.",

Next my entree sat at the bar until it got cold and made incorrectly with burnt greasy sweet potato fries.  They replaced it with another cold entree which I ate because I was afraid to send it back again.  Next, I spent more time waiting for them to fix the bowling lane than actually bowling.    I would not recommend this place.  They have a good concept, but a LOT of kinks to work out.",

We put our name in to bowl and were told it would be 30 min. It took 2 hours.   Our server took a very long time to get back to us and to take orders. She would take one order and leave for 10 minutes. Was told I wouldn't be charged extra for something but when the bill came sure enough there was a surcharge. I'm fine with paying extra for add-ons, just don't tell me it won't be extra and then charge me for it.",

    "text": "I was disappointed in the service at Queen Park Social. This was my second time here. My first time was about two weeks after they opened and it was for brunch. The service at that time was great and the brunch was good. This time was different because of the lack luster service. Where do I start with the service. I was at a 4 top table and only two of us ordered drinks. I ordered a mule and a water and my friend ordered a daiquiri. Both of which are on the menu. 15 minutes later, our server came back and told my friend they couldn't make a daiquiri becuase they don't have a blender behind the bar. Um then why is it on the menu?! Then he asked me what did I order again for my drink. Smh. I told him a mule and that I also needed a water and my friend ordered a berry social. At that same time another person at our table ordered a round of lemon drop shots for 5 ppl and I also ordered some queso dip. Another 10 minutes later, the server brought the mule and my friend's berry social. My mule was horrible, it was way too sweet and my friend's drink didn't have berries in it. I sent my drink back and the lemon drop shots were horrible, they didn't taste like lemon at all. Another girl at the table noticed that my friend's drink didn't have berries either because she got the samw drink earlier. My friend asked the server  why she didn't have any berries in her drink. His reply was, oh, I thought you ordered a Socially Acceptable. So needless to say, he got the order wrong. He then told us that we would have to leave at 8pm bc of the fight party starting at that time. At this point it's about 7:30pm and I still hadn't gotten my queso that I ordered 25 mins ago. At that point I asked him to cancel the order if it wasn't ready yet and he said okay. Another 10 mins later I still didn't have water but he brought the queso. I told him that I canceled it and he said it was sitting back there a while so he brought it. I ordered that queso 30 mins ago and now I only had a few mins to eat it before we had to leave. I finally got my water too. The service was slow and disjointed. And there wasn't a need for the service to be that slow and disjointed. Needless to say, I won't be back for a while.",

Severely understaffed. 1 waitress with a bad attitude to take care of one whole section. Didn't mind the wait for the food, but had to go to the bar to order drinks while we waited to order from our server. Got a cheeseburger that was over-cooked and my wife got the nachos with chicken which was just overall gross.   Spoke with manager Ross who was not around at all. Told us that the section we were sitting is not guaranteed a server, though we were sitting in a booth on the restaurant side. No problem but no one told this. It sounded rather ridiculous but whatever. He comped the nachos and told me that \"a lot of people like their food\" I said ok and thank you and left.   I love that they have a space to watch Miami Dolphins games but wouldn't go back due to very poor service and lackluster food.",

Even their staff suggested we close our tab, because they couldn't keep up. Miserable experience, they definitely needed more bartenders to improve.
