Green beans, ahi tuna, sliders, caprese salad, and prosciutto.  Nothing stood out. Ahi tuna was the best and sliders was weakest (beef had funny flavor but dish looked appetizing).    Would go back with a group as atmosphere was fun.",

I can bake just about anything, so I am tough to satisfy. The apple ravioli succeeded. The right balance of softness and crispness, and the cinnamon sugar on top was just the cherry on the cake. Furthermore, the ice cream was really creamy and tasty (be careful with the ice cream you serve if you want to be appreciated, that can ruin an otherwise great pie!). And last but not least, the staff was nice too.",

    "text": "i used to shy away from small plate eateries thinking why pay so much for so little. Then i realized it pretty much works out for us as the cost equivalent to 2 entrees minus the excess food forcing me to stuff myself.    We were craving absolutely nothing, so we decided to just go Uptown for dinner on a weeknight. We ended up parking on Church Street and wandered down to Dandelion Market. Two seats had just opened at the bar with no wait, so the bar we sat. The bar lady was very friendly and wore a real smile the whole night. They still have a solid beer list and the fact that they have $3 beers on Mondays sounds amazing given its Uptown location.   We had the zucchini salad, baked potato croquettes, and the trio of spreads. The pita that came with the spreads had a garlic taste with a nice touch of salt. A single spread didn't stand out over the others, but enjoyed them all. This was the most filling of our plates. The potato croquettes were good, but only came with 4 little potato thingies which seemed small even for a small plate. The scallion cream that came with the potatoes was very light and added very little flavor, just a damp texture. The zucchini salad was cuts of zucchini lengthwise with a dressing, a few craisins and cheese. A solid opening dish.   Overall, we had great beer, good food, and excellent service and i would definitely recommend this place for a weeknight dinner and drink.",

We came to Charlotte  from the Orlando area (suprisingly foodie  friendly ), and were  expecting  to be bowled over by the food. Sadly, this wasn't  the case.  I ordered  a drink that had some fancy name but was basically  a gin ricky.  I had to send it back for more St. Germaine because it was tasteless. We ordered the cheddar  sliders which were flavorful but the bun was so dry it crumbled in your hand. Then the mussels, meh is the only thing I can say. I'm used to there being at least an inch of delicious creamy soup with giant amounts of bread. I get it, tapas. But seriously, 2 little croutons each? No worries, they were pretty bland regardless. Then the bizarre greenbeans came.  Basically take some regular ol greenbeans  and coat them in bottled sauce.  I thought they'd  be great fried as a finger food as it was tapas  but nope, wet and weird.  Service was fine, not spectacular  but average.  I  wouldn't waste my time here until they correct what's going on in the kitchen.",

    "text": "This place and especially our last visit there was nearly perfect.  I called in advance to ask about parking (normally we've cabbed it uptown or taken the light rail, but this time we were driving and didn't know if the restaurant validated at a nearby lot, didn't matter, we found street parking right across from the Market) and spoke with a young woman who was pleasant.  We decided this time that instead of ordering nine different small plates, we would start with one then order two more and see how we were feeling.  Good call, we were stuffed. All in all the wife and I have been here a bunch and have tried just about everything on the menu and it has all been at the least 8/10 stars for taste and quality, so you really cannot go wrong, just order what sounds good for you at that time.  Beer/Wine selection is awesome for me (not so much for the prego wife) always a good list of great beer.  The only thing that holds our most recent visit back from a full 5 stars was the crappy attitude the hostess had. Horrible.  When I tell you we want a table, and you indicate we can sit at the bar, and we reply that we don't want to sit at the bar and would prefer to wait, don't give me the stink eye, do your job, walk around the MASSIVE dining room and see where people are at in their dinner service.  Then MAYBE extend some courtesy and say something, I don't know, along the lines of \"Well feel free to wait at the bar or right over here and I'll come and get you when a table is ready..\"  Or just stare at us uncomfortably for a few moments.  Thank the lord above our server more than made up for the inexperience up front, she was quick, funny, and her timing was excellent.  Of course we'll be back, just hoping we don't have to deal with negative Nancy up front again.",

You can see old horse carriage wheels hung on the walls, some wooden barrels, and a knight armor in the corner. Pretty cool!   For lunch, I had a parmesan chicken salad sandwich which used a French croissant instead of bread. It was amazing and very fresh. Also their French fries were delicious with very crispy batter!   I can wait to be back here on a Friday or Saturday night, I heard the first floor is a pub-type bar, and the second floor turns into a club with live DJ.   I will keep you posted!",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Charlotte for her business trip and we went to Dandelion Market for an early anniversary dinner. We had a great time and a nice meal.  We walked in around 5:30 on a Wednesday and were seated right away; the restaurant was maybe 1/4 full. It has a nice ambiance: romantic lighting, brick walls. It's a nice atmosphere for a cozy, romantic dinner.  Their wine list online and on the printed menu at the restaurant is wine by the bottle only, and each bottle is $25. This turned us off from going there for lunch, but it needn't have, since it turned out they had a chalkboard on one wall with a selection of wines by the glass. They also have a good beer selection, including Bell's Two-Hearted, my favorite beer.  We ordered off their dinner menu, which is all tapas (small plates), between about $6 - $12 each. With tapas, we like to order one or two at a time, up to about four total for the two of us. We started with their Artisanal Cheese Board, which came with 3 really nice cheeses, apricot preserves, honeycomb, almond cake/loaf of some sort, and some pita bread wedges. It was a nice enough cheese tray and went well with our Pinot Noir. Our next two tapas were the Shrimp and Grits and Grilled Steak Skewers. The grits were actually two grit cakes, topped with goat cheese--interesting and very nice. The steak skewers were cooked medium rare (there's no choice in the matter) and straight-forward, but very good. We finished the meal with Stuffed Poblano Pepper--stuffed with sausage and cheese, topped with a cream sauce--that was just fantastic. Easily the highlight of the meal. If we went back, I think we'd be tempted to get two of those as an entree.  For dessert, we were told they had had an unexpected run on desserts this week, but were supplementing the 2 house-made desserts they had left with a couple choices from a nearby bakery. We got the Oreo Cheesecake from the bakery, and were not disappointed--they chose bakeries well.  Overall, we had a great, filling romantic dinner--with a bottle of wine--for a pretty great price. Every thing we got was either good or great, and our waitress was great. We were so happy that, when my wife stayed an extra day to finish her trip, she went back for her final dinner in Charlotte. We'll definitely try to make a trip our next time in town.",

I was really excited to try the southern caprese (fried green tomatoes and house made mozarella) but the cheese was too firm, too cold and really underwhelming. The tomatoes were great, sauced with a sweet balsamic. That same balsamic, however, fully OVER-sauced the prosciutto crostinis beyond palatability. We had a sausage plate, fine but regular, a nice bean dish with a tomatoey herby sauce, and mussels, that seemed to be cooked in the very same sauce. Good sauce, just redundant.  A cucumber cocktail was too sweet to drink and the wine was fine, but regular.  I didn't hate it by any means, but it wasn't properly satisfying and I surely wouldn't go back.",

The antipasto was pepperoni, Spanish chorizo (the hard kind), soppressata(?), and olives. The cheese plate was a 3 out of 4, but I was happy to find one of them was from Sheep's milk!

Dandelion has a fun gastropub vibe, with random kitsch (think a wall of clogs organized in a pyramid), a couple of tvs tuned to sports and a middle bloody mary bar (at least during brunch).  There were a dozen or so beers on tap and the drink menu was diverse. We attempted to hair-of-the-dog it with mimosas, which were ok but not the best I've had. It was a futile effort anyways. The strong, fresh coffee was better.  There were a handful of delicious sounding breakfast options (think creative hash and omellette dishes) and several more lunch options. I debated on trying the mustard burger sliders, but settled on the grilled cheese and tomato soup instead. While we waited the bar tender dropped off warm biscuits with two different jellies.  After a too long 30+ minute wait, out comes the star. Giant, thick, grilled and buttered bread oozing cheese. The tomato soup was also thick, just how I like it. Who has time to worry about headaches while eating such artery clogging perfection? It hit the spot.  Unfortunately the bartender, who was good at first, faded out and became very slow. Watching her text on her phone while we waited for the check was frustrating. Overall though this was a solid brunch choice and I'd gladly go back and try dinner.",

I was so disappointed, really it was just a bunch of bland food accompanied by overly exaggerated dips and spreads, the lamb lollipops were gross, and the mini sliders were unbeatable. The best thing on their menu was fries. I totally recommend getting fries when you come here. Plus the restaurant was SO DARK I had to use my phone for a flashlight. I walked out of there starving!! McDonald's has better fries for cheaper prices and you will be able to see what your eating!! Plus all the trash that was on the floor going down the stairs.......",

When it came out, it best resembled a soup with egg...Pretty gross to be honest. I had a bloody mary with it too, house mix is Zing Zang. Could have easier made it at home and had it tasted 10x better at least. Hot sauce bar is a perk though.  Also ordered brussel sprouts which were COATED in oil. Somehow even worse than the rancheros.  Then the mimosa came, atleast 50% OJ.  Overall experience was only improved because the service was great, but food was honestly terrible. Would not go back for anything other than a beer.",

    "text": "I decided to stop by this place on a trip out to Charlotte because of their extensive small plate offerings.  I love trying a bunch of different things, so small plates are always very appealing to me.  I just didn't realize this place was a Irish Pub until I went there.  Maybe it's just me, but a Irish Pub is one of last places I'd expect to encounter small plates/tapas fare.  For me that just makes this establishment all that much more appealing, because I always love unique places.  Well the food is exceptional here, and Ireland is, after all, one of my ancestral homelands, so how could I not like this place.         Dandelion Market is right off Tryon on 5th St. and well within walking distance to most uptown destinations.  I'd had my heart set on the Fried Calamari, the Southern Caprese and the Fried Pickles, cause pickles are just awesome and frying them, just like anything else, makes them all that much better.  The Southern Caprese is just pure genius.  I love fried green tomatoes and Caprese salads, so I figured how could this not be amazing...well it definitely is.  The salty sour fried green tomatoes end up being a great contrast against the rich fresh mozzarella, but the fig balsamic dressing seals the deal on this one.  It's has just the right amount of sweetness and combined with the micro greens they tie the whole dish together in perfect balance.  Don't expect it to be at all like a traditional Caprese salad, as the fried green tomatoes and lack of basil take the dish in a whole new direction.  As for the Fried Calamari, seriously no lie, it was the absolute best fried calamari I have ever had in my whole life.  The calamari was cooked perfectly, and that is no small feat.  I could bite through it effortlessly, I mean it didn't even have the slightest inkling of chewiness to it.  The calamari itself had great flavor and the lemon garlic aioli and grilled lemon just made it even more incredible.  I still can't believe how good it was, and would tell people to go here specifically just to try it.  The fried pickles were just so so, and I probably wouldn't order again.  All I got out of them was a super crispy ubiquitous fried flavor that was lacking the sour briny taste I love about fried pickles.  The horseradish aioli was delicious, and was the saving grace for this dish for sure.      Overall this place is a solid 4.5 stars.  The food and atmosphere are well worth a visit, and the service is just phenomenal.  Anytime I needed or wanted anything, someone was all over it before I knew what hit me.  The restaurant space itself is pretty amazing in itself.  You can tell the whole place originates from days long past.  The space has a very classic vintage feel that just can't be duplicated from scratch now a days.  This is definitely a special place and is absolutely one of my go to spots in Charlotte now.",

    "text": "I wanted Blue Finn, my friend wanted Pita Pit...Dandelion Market was our happy medium. Before I agreed on this place, I had to scope out the menu. I saw tapas...lots of delicious tapas!   While waiting for my friend to arrive, I decided to try the beer special. A grapefruit wheat beer poured over a simple orange chili syrup. Yummmm. The combination of citrus and heat was refreshing with just the right amount of heat. The waitress informed me that this particular beer was not in stores just yet and they had the exclusive opportunity to showcase it before it was introduced to the public. When my friend arrived, she tasted the beer without the syrup because she doesn't like spice. She enjoyed the beer and we both sipped on this tasty grapefruit beverage as we enjoyed our dinner.  Ok so let's get to the tapas. The menu is broken down into sections by appetizers, surf, turf, etc. Deserts aren't listed because they vary by the day. Here's a list of what we ordered:  fruit and nut salad with poached pears prosciutto crostini  curried turkey meatballs  grilled steak skewers  baked potato croquettes apple pie ravioli with house made vanilla ice cream  Stars for the night were the salad, prosciutto crostini, and the grilled steak skewers. The potato croquets tasted like your standard potato wedge and were lacking in flavor. The curried meatballs won the honorable mention award for flavor and moistness. The waitress did a good job of building up the desert so I was expecting a lot more but ended up with a dish that was basically an apple turnover with ice cream :/. The food didn't add up to her description. She did however do a wonderful job with descriptions for the tapas. I had lots of questions and she successfully answered all of them! There are so many options, perfect for sharing and for trying new dishes each time you visit.",

Seemed genuinely excited to be serving us, which having worked in the industry I doubt highly was the case, but she sold the heck out of it. Really, really great.  It's a nice stop. Sharing is what you'll be doing here, so know that going in. The lamb was for me overcooked but flavor was still otherwise where you want it, other handful we tried they nailed it. The calamari, which is a throwaway so many places, was perfect. Well done stuff. That in particular impressed me, it's so easy to do but so bad 90% of places. It proved they care.  It's not the peak of the mountain, but it has a nice concept, nice people, and overall quite good food. I don't live in Charlotte and won't be back there without a pistol held to my temple, but if you're there, this is a cute place to spend two hours or so. If I was there it'd certainly get a second visit, probably much more.  It was only the two of us, they don't do reservations for smaller than eight. If you got a large group from what I scouted it's an excellent choice, made for it even.",

Also awkward, was getting my own plates, since they all had to be modified to be made vegan, instead of sharing with my friends. Of course, I guess that is because of the restaurant style, not this particular restaurant. Obviously I'd go to an all-vegan small plates place if I had the choice! Anyways, on to the food. I had the vegan versions of the hummus and pita, black bean sliders, and green beans. It was way too much food, even though they suggested 3 plates per person. But it was all very good! I especially liked the flavor of the sliders. The drinks were good too, and our server was great. All in all, not worth the money, but the food was good.",

    "text": "Go to this place. Eat. Drink. Don't think too hard about what to eat and drink because you cannot go wrong here. I've been here twice now, and I haven't repeated a single dish yet. Despite taking such big risks, I not only have yet to be disappointed, I've enjoyed each one. So far I've had deviled eggs, baked potato croquettes, BBQ short rib, grilled steak skewers (medium rare), pan seared scallops, meatballs marinara, beet salad, and pan seared ahi tuna. I'd have to say the steak skewers (thanks to our server for the recommendation) and the beet salad are my favorites so far while the pan seared scallops are a close third, but every dish was done very well. The skewers were cooked perfectly, and the sugar in the marinade caramelized onto the meat to give it a nice crunchy exterior texture to bite into. The beet salad had a house vinaigrette that was much less heavy than a typical one and had a fantastic flavor. The ahi tuna is actually a very generous portion, and the sauces it comes with go well together to flavor the fish without being overwhelming despite containing some wasabi. The meatballs marinara are on the house favorites list and with good reason: you get exactly what you're asking for with a perfect ratio of cheese to sauce to meatballs (4).  I almost forgot to mention this, but the braised collards and pineapple that come with the scallops are amazing (I didn't leave even a bit in the serving dish). The scallops are also cooked to have a slight crisp on the outsides, which is a nice contrast to the collards. I also haven't had a chance to mention that the service here was great. I had a whole bottle of water as soon as I sat down and several staff made sure I was fine and let me know my server would be with me shortly while I was waiting (which was not long at all). Our water was full the whole time, and the food and beer recommendations were great. Also, we were lucky enough to land here for their Tuesday beer specials, which consists of several local brews and several other solid mainstream brews on tap for $3 per glass. $3 per glass means trying new things out isn't all that costly, and we were thrilled we did because the local brews were honestly much better than their mainstream counterparts. Kudos to these guys for knowing how to pick great beers for their tap list.",

It's a rustic looking pub, old exposed wood and brick with dim lighting and a cozy atmosphere. When I heard we would be dining at the \"Dandelion Market\" I was expecting a more open and bright place, more like a farmers market vibe. I was instantly reminded of the bars in Dublin at Temple Bar, which I believe is exactly what they were trying for.   They had a good sized menu of small plates for dinner, also some sandwiches and other items for lunch. I tried a bite or two of the fried pickles, grilled steak skewers, ale simmered sausage bites, tiger prawns, and the santa fe corn. I heard the market mac n cheese, baked potato croquettes, and the prosciutto crostini were all very good as well.   The service was terrific all night. We were there for about three hours and the servers kept our glasses full and made sure we were well fed.   I can't wait till the next time I'm in Charlotte and can try brunch at Dandelion Market, it sounds delicious.",

Came here to celebrate many things, one being the second time I had to take the MPRE bc North Carolina is so tight about requirements for out-of-state attorneys! All good, gave me a chance to catch up on beers and convo with work buds.    Only thing I don't like is the awkward ceiling support bars attached to some tables that are designed for 6 people to sit.  When I take out my wallet, phone (4s, sorry, I love it), keys, gum, eye drops, watch, cigarettes, headphones... I find my space limited! JK on the last 6 items, but still, it's a little tight.  Nothing they can really do about it I guess.   It's a nice after-work bar, came in on the day of the Taylor Swift concert but there were no attendees in attendance at that particular bar - shoulda headed over to Epicentre.  Regardless, had a great time there.  dmo out.",

We made the mistake of ordering the \"flatbread with goat cheese and pesto.\" Instead, we actually got a cracker with broccoli-like material on top. Turns out, that was rapini, the bitter cousin of broccoli making a surprise appearance since it wasn't listed on the menu. The server had to point to the micro splash of goat cheese hidden under the rapini, and we never did see the pesto. Most of our other food- calamari, brussel sprouts, short rib (singular)- was merely OK but not worth the price. The sliders were really good. The brunch here is good, but I would not go back for dinner and would not recommend it to friends. There are tons of better places nearby.",

She couldn't hear our order and instead of politely asking again she immediately said \"next time speak up\". And then the entire visit she sat in the corner talking with staff and I had to literally beg for drinks. I felt as though I was bothering her to do her job.   The next time, We had friends over and wanted them to see the upstairs of the restaurant turned into a club environment. The bouncer was so rude in checking our IDs. I have no idea his name but I definitely felt singled out. After we got in he said I needed to fix my \"attitude\". I told him my attitude is justified after his behavior at the door then all of sudden a manager comes over and kicks us out. She even called over police and had me escorted out in embarrassment for no reason at all.   At this point i really believe the bar staff may be discriminating. As no one else has any issues here. I live literally next to this place so I can say the venue is not too diverse. Maybe that's why they treated us so different. I shouldn't have to feel this way, so why do I? Please do better guys.",

The waitress also didn't greet us or even bother to explain the menu or what they only had available for lunch. After telling her that we may need another minute, the waitress, bartender and hostess were all in the kitchen picking at food, talking and on their phone for so long that we decided to leave. Clearly no one goes there for lunch, it was empty. Maybe the business wouldn't suffer during lunch if it was properly staffed with people who actually want to be there.

Our group tried their arugula salad with fried brie, brussel sprouts, sliders, patatas bravas, proscuitto goat cheese bites, and ahi tuna. All of these bites were INCREDIBLE!

Crustini was good but sweet sauce nearly ruined it. Bread w the gooey spinach dip was cold not toasted. Small serving of steak skewers were tasty but small. I guess it's fun to eat small plates but this was unsatisfying.",

It's not the cheapest place but also not super expensive. Bonus--they have SO many vegetarian options.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with coworkers.  The lunch menu is very, very, very different.  It's almost like a Boar's Head Deli lunch menu.  Basically there are a limited variety of sandwiches or burgers, two soups, and maybe three salads.  The portions are much more generous for the price compared to dinner, but I wouldn't call them big.  With a group of 10, we were able to be seated on one table in short order, and the location still never filled up around us.  There was quite a bit of disorganization around ordering, but the server was sweet and patient, splitting the checks automatically and with a perfect recollection.  The orders came out fairly scattered, with two orders arriving much later than the first round.  All told, it took us just about 90 minutes to have lunch, given this awkward delay; not bad for 10 people, but seems like it could have been faster given how empty the place was.  Everyone seemed satisfied with their orders, good flavor and fresh food.  The drinks kept being replenished automatically.  I would suggest that if you order the grilled cheese, get a side of something--fries, a salad, or sliders--to go with, as that meal is a smaller portion than the rest of the options, even with the soup.  Dandelion Market, you've now got a daytime win under your belt, in my book.  I'd definitely come back here for a work lunch.",

I normally like to go for pint night on Mondays where they serve $3 drafts or wine night on Tuesday's where they serve $15 bottles of wine.  For the tapas, I would recommend the spinach dip, calamari and crostini.  They're desserts come from a local bakery as well and are fantastic too, I would recommend the rotational cheesecake. The late night is pretty fun here as well and the brunch is fantastic.  At brunch they serve a build your own Bloody Mary bar and it's fantastic. Again, I would highly recommend, one of my favorites places to go in Charlotte.  The service and food is always great! They really understand customer service at the restaurant!",

I have eaten here 15+ times, and NEVER have I had a bad experience or not thoroughly enjoyed all of my food.    Dandelion Market's menu is made up of small plates designed to be shared.  I would recommend ordering 2 - 3 small plates per person.  They have 2 bars - a small one downstairs and a larger bar upstairs.   They offer all of the bottles of wine for $25 and have 8 -12 beers on tap, along with a full bar.    A few items that really stand out on the menu include the ahi tuna, proscuito flatbread and sea scallops.  That being said, you really cannot go wrong - pick something, you'll likely love it!!!",

It's a cool place nonetheless.   We were seated at table with bar stools because they had quite a few large groups taking up some of the tables and this was the only option available. You can order your own or share a few to share. The portions are small so I recommend ordering about two if you're having a meal.  I ordered the baked potato croquettes and grilled steak skewers and got to try some of pan seared ahi tuna, dando brussel sprouts, meatballs marinara, and sweet potato gnocchi. I enjoyed the potato croquettes and grilled steak skewers. The croquettes were fried perfectly, crispy on the outside and the potatoes insides weren't clumpy and paired well with the dip. The skewers were a lot more tender than I thought they would come out, which was great. The ahi tuna was good, but it didn't stand out to me as anything exceptional. The brussel sprouts were fine, but I think they would be better if they were crispy. They felt a bit soggy. I also thought the meatballs and gnocchi were just A-OK.  Overall, food was decent, service was good, and atmosphere was unique.",

I had the calamari which was outstanding.  It was just a tad saltier than necessary but it actually paired very well with the dipping sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  If you like squid, you know it sometimes gets turned into rubber bands but they nailed it.  Overall, we would recommend this to anyone.",

There were three of us and one vegetarian. We got the cheese plate, the hummus sampler, Shrimp and grits (Grit cake was piping hot), Ahi-tuna, green beans and some other items.

The food was very tasty but it was microscopic my mac & cheese was about the size of a normal mug Evan got the tale of the cow for his steak literally nothing on that skewer and a few leafy greens as a salad. Ryan's flat bread was about 4 mm in thickness and it had to pepperoni's total. also kind of weird but it came out on a cutting board instead of a plate as well.  we should've known something was up when we got our shot glass sized water cups in he beginning thoy so that was our fault. we paid and left and now are on our way to our second restaurant of the night for a more filling dinner.",

What we ordered-  Flat bread Scallops  Mac and Cheese Fried potato ball of some sort. We re-ordered it because it was sooo good.",

Next are the freshly baked home made biscuits.  I could make a meal on these.  So many different mixes & all the trimmings.  Then you get to the menu & the food is great.  A southern flare with twists.  I am a seafood lover & the Crab Cake Benny and the Carolina Shore Omelette are amazing.  The Lamb Lollipops are tasty & well prepared.  Everyone is friendly & the service is fast though we love to lounge at the bar over our meal & that's perfectly okay too.",

Our waitress was kind, but was far and between when checking on us.   Food: A great range of tapas food. From vegetarian, sea and meat. It's hard to pin point what stood out because we ordered at least 15 different plates. But personally the Prosciutto Crostini sticks out. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. It was a bold punch of flavors. That just melts in your mouth. I would go back JUST to eat this. We stuck with a bottle of wine and skipped deserts.  Overall: Would I return? Maybe at lunch if it was better lit? And was able to have a conversation with my colleagues. Also for the crostini. Wasn't blown away.",

    "text": "Dandelion Market is one of my favorite tapas restaurants in the QC and on my latest trip I enjoyed the market to its fullest. We wen't out with a couple friends and took full advantage of plate sharing and four hungry appetites.   We ended up splitting 20 plates by the end of the night which was just a few plates shy of breaking our personal group record of 28 plates while dining at Good Food on Montford a couple weeks prior. We started the night out by getting the Charcuterie Board, the Artisanal Cheese Board, and the Vietnamese Spring Rolls. I can't say much about the spring rolls other than they we're cold and without the accompanying slightly spicy sauce to dip them in they might not be worth recommending. The cheese board had a small assortment of salty, creamy, and savory cheeses that started off the evening on the right track and paired well with the sliced meats on the charcuterie board.    Next we dove into the Baked Potato Croquettes, the Fried Pickles, Black Bean Sliders, and the Moroccan Lamb Kabobs. The croquettes were so incredibly delicious that we ended up ordering a second plate. The little fried balls of aged cheddar, Beeler's bacon, and scallion cream are the type of thing worth making a pilgrimage out of. The fried pickles were sliced not speared and had a great crunch that made them stand out against some of Charlottes other greasy and flimsy fried pickle alternatives. The black bean sliders were largely thought of as ok but didn't leave us with any notable impression.   Then we dove into the next section with the Butter Sauteed Sea Scallops and the Pan Seared Ahi Tuna. The tuna was the clear favorite between the two dishes but the scallops still held their own and were worth recommending.   The Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops, Dando Ribs, Grilled Chicken Wings, Grilled Steak Skewers, Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Market Mac & Cheese, and the Zucchini Ribbon Pasta finished off the night. The lamb lollipops were delicious but the cherry glaze that accompanied them taste like cough syrup and was definitely a down side for the dish. The dando ribs and the chicken wings were juicy and tender but couldn't hold their weight against the crowned king of the night. The grilled steak skewers are marinated in an asian brown sugar soy sauce and a sweet chili sauce. The steak skewers melt in your mouth and create such a euphoric feeling you might end up ordering several more :)  The Mac & Cheese came with spiral noodles, a crumb topping, and plenty of CHEESE, CHEESE, and more CHEESE!!!! The Mac & Cheese was made even better by adding the sausage stuffed poblano pepper... it created a very high-end cheesy Hamburger Helper. The zucchini pasta was the only non-fried healthy vegetable plate we ordered for the night and probably a wise decision given the immense amount of meat we had eaten at that point.   No dinner is complete without dessert so we ordered a brownie sundae, an apple fritter, and a chocolate cake (to-go). The triple chocolate brownie sundae was delicious and one of the few things that should be noted as not a small plate... I repeat... this is plenty big enough to share between two people. The apple fritter left us wanting more but the accompanying ice cream made for a nice pairing between the hot apple cinnamon and the cold ice cream. The chocolate cake was topped with ganache but largely came across as an average piece of chocolate cake.   Dandelion Market is an incredible tapas restaurant and every trip leaves us counting down the days until we make a return visit. Check them out and let me know what you think :)",

The shrimp and grits was the perfect amount, although slightly too much heat for me.  The goat cheese topping the grits made it tolerable for me.  The grand finale for me was the lamp lollipops, the only thing I thought a tad disappointing was the lamb was not medium rare, but still very tender at medium done.  My server was so nice she asked the kitchen to re-make it!  I originally wanted to give this place a 4 star but it deserves a 5 star because they care!  I posted before and after so you be the judge of it.",

I know I'm in a rut, but it's a rut I'm happy to be in.  I've also been for dinner several times and LOVED it. I took my mom when I first moved to Charlotte and she asks to go back every time she visits.  I've never had anything I didn't like here. I would recommend the scallops and the sweet potato gnocchi in particular. Its definitely a little pricey but since it's small plates it's easy to keep the cost down if you just want to sample a couple things.   My only complaint is that they have a lunch card (I think buy 9 lunch entrees get the 10th free?) and I was about 6 lunches in before I found out about the card. They also never ask if you have one so I always forget and have only had it stamped once. If you work nearby and go for lunch a lot, take advantage of this! The staff probably won't tell you about it.",

We were staying in the area for a long weekend and I discovered it on yelp while simultaneously having drinks at TILT and seacrhing for a place nearby that we could grab a late dinner.  The atmosphere of Dandelion Market is small, cozy, dark, and inviting.  Our server was really sweet and did a great job of tolerating my slightly inebriated husband and myself.  This is a tapas style restaurant so we ordered abottle of wine and several small plates to share.  We enjoyed the cheese plate, prosciutto crostini, sausage stuffed poblano, mac and cheese, and the seared ahi tuna.  Everything we had was absolutely delicious; I especially liked the prosciutto crostini, which was the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  My husband really enjoyed the mac and cheese, which tasted like the roux was made with bacon drippings.  We both agreed we would return here the next time we visit Charlotte--it's a great date night spot!",

Reading the previous reviews, it does look like a pub of some sort but the foods offered comes out soo pretty.  I had to sent back their cucumber mint mojitos. Since its 4pm in the afternoon, and being my 1st for the day. I figure I'll stick with the more water down mojitos. They do liquor up their drinks. I was buzz half way thru.  My friend Tiff ordered the burger sliders, red pepper/artichoke dip and the Brussels spouts. I ordered the baked potato croquettes and the grilled chicken wings.  The red pepper/-artichoke dip is a little salty for me. The crispy pita are very good tho. The Brussels spouts are delicious. I'm getting that agin next time. The baked potato croquettes are a little bland. You definitely need the scallion cream that comes with it. The grilled chicken wings are bad ass. I can definitely taste the chipotle brown sugar rub. Finish with the ranch dipping sauce provided.  Amanda our waitress/bartender are the sweetest thing.. She's tentative, laugh at our jokes even tho it's not that funny and she's on point.. I have to get over the decor because it look a little gloomy that day I came in but I can definitely overcome that when the food are pretty, good and customer service are great.",

We had a really nice waitress, who was gracious enough to help us out with our time constraint (the game started at 7 PM).  One of my friend's & I decided to share our meal...we got the mac 'n cheese, meatballs, tuna, wings, fried pickles, & the southern caprise salad. Everything we had was perfect & had an interesting spin. My favorite would have to be the fried pickles. The lightly battered pickles were spicy & delicious. The mac 'n cheese was my second favorite, even though they used the spiral noodles. It was creamy!   The layout is pretty spacious & can accommodate big groups - there was a huge birthday party going on i(n the more open space) & we didn't feel crampt.

We had the peas, gnocchi, lamb medallions, sprouts, brownie, lasagna and caprese- it was so goood and less than 70 with two beers!   I didn't like the Brussel sprouts, they were sad and lifeless the waitress, Katie I believe was so good, incredibly passionate about the menu and very fun to have her serve us. I will return",

    "text": "Went here for a late dinner. Loved the ambience! The location is right in the middle of everything. The waitress didnt know about the \"local\" beer. Couldn't answer questions on descriptions of flavor.  Potato croquettes- had no BACON. It's in the description and the most important ingredient. It was an unsalted fried potatoe cake.  Fried Zuccini - Lacked seasoning. Adding some parmesan cheese to the batter or slightly melted on top makes a huge difference in flavor. The dipping sauce does not compliment the delicacy of 5g3 zuccini. Its bitter. Bitter. Bitter. +The actually zuccini was moist.  Short Rib - The meat was cooked nicely. Doused in a bitter BBQ sauce which was increased with the picked red onions. Something a little more mild would have complimented the meat and the onions would have melded.  Pork Belly - no crisp! Pork belly needs a nice sear..it was mildly warm fat.",

I had the Mac and cheese as my entree, and It was excellent! Definitely one of the best I've had in any restaurant. The top had a breading which added a crunch to it, and the inside was deliciously creamy. The waiter was attentive and prompt as well.   Although I did not stay for drinks, I did check out the upstairs bar location which looked very fun. The friend I was eating with said that at night the large wooden table in the center is hoisted up into the air for more floor space - a very neat concept.   Overall, I definitely would recommend a visit to Dandelion Market for a quieter, cool dinner spot. And also for that delicious Mac and cheese!",

The fries had amazing homemade catchup that had a unique flavor also the fries were very crispy.   I would give this restaurant an A+   The only complaint would be the water comes in tiny glasses ( like bigger shot glasses ) loved it and will come back again!",

    "text": "So happy that I ate at Dandelion Market while staying in Charlotte. I only ate one dinner out during my short trip, and I'm confident that a visit here was the best decision possible.  The menu has so many fantastic sounding small plates that it can be tough to decide what to order. Because all bottles of wine were 25 dollars, we started there.   After a great deal of consideration and some input from our very sweet waitress, we went with four of the small plates. Fried pickles, smoked wings, goat cheese and prosciutto crostini and short ribs. The portions were generous, and definitely were not as small as other tapas spots that I've been to. Especially the fried pickles, which came with more then I've ever seen on one plate. Because of that, we could have probably done fine with 3 items.  Everything was well prepared and delicious. The pickles were perfectly fried and crunchy, the short rib was melt in your mouth, the crostini was generously topped and the wings were smoked to perfection. Judging by the food photos and smiling faces around us, I'm sure that nothing on the menu would have been disappointing.   The service was excellent and the prices were fair. 25 dollars for any bottle of wine is a steal. Next time I visit Charlotte, I'll want to try new places but will have a hard time not returning here. It's just that good!",

So, we were not allowed to order the items we wanted. (Just a note: maybe don't give out all you menus on one board with food we can't order). Now the food we did order, the roast beef sandwich and the Monte Cristo were delicious. The flavor profile of the Monte Cristo was an amazing combination from the ham, cheese, blackberry puree, and syrup. The French fries were nice and crisp, but they only provide a seasoned ketchup and my friend hated it. They don't have traditional ketchup. We did try dessert, which they get from a bakery. My cake was so dry, I thwacked it with a spoon and it sounded like I was hitting a drum. It was solid and dry. I had it replaced with the cheesecake, which was decent, but overpriced. Our server was pretty terrible. We had to go to the bar for refills and we never saw her that much. A pretty underwhelming experience. The entrees were great, but everything else fell short.",

The lamp pops were insane and with just a touch of sweetness - oh and the cherries on the side of the plates were incredible.

The entire party would've willingly ordered more drinks, but alas, our glasses sat empty as our server was nowhere to be found.  The apple butter that was served with the biscuits was good.  The blackberry mimosa that I had was good, just never replenished.  Another member of my group had the french toast sticks, and they were sweet, but decent.  It wasn't all horrible, and I think most of our experience can be attributed to the poor service.  I imagine our food was cold because it sat in the kitchen window waiting for her to run it to the table, but in her questionable absence, it sat until lukewarm.  I'd say it might be worth giving them another try, but I'm in no hurry to do so.",

    "text": "I really love this place. I've been here three times now- for dinner tapas, lunch with a girl friend and also for Sunday brunch. It's in my neighborhood and has a wide variety of things to choose from- we got a ton of small plates to choose from (caprese to salmon cakes to brussel sprouts) when we came for dinner, which was perfect for two people to share. Shortly after I met a friend for lunch, where we both got grilled cheese and tomato soup- so great for these unseasonably cold winter days.  So brunch is interesting- it's served until 3 and all their specialty items look amazing. I settled on the hash and my BF got the migas. I loved my hash- full of potatoes, andouille sausage and okra- spiced to perfection and not too filling. The migas were pretty eggy though- definitely could have used more fillings and less egg. I also noticed a bloody mary bar (we just got coffee), which is also a cute brunch touch.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch so my review is limited to that.  There was so much here that I wanted to order, from huevos rancheros and migas to biscuit sandwiches, but we both set our sights on the monte cristo...ham, turkey, cheese, on French toast with blackberry preserves for dipping.  They were delicious!  Our waitress was also fantastic...very friendly and on the ball.  We needed a quick meal before leaving town, and this did not disappoint.  If I came back to Charlotte, I'd love to try their dinner menu, as it looked equally appealing.  Also, we found the price to be very reasonable for the portion you got, so I'd highly recommend it as an awesome, centrally-located brunch spot in Charlotte.  We were staying at the Marriot, and it took like two minutes to walk there..and they open for brunch at 10 AM, while many other restaurants we looked at didn't open until 11.",

    "text": "This is a great place for lunch and Sunday bunch!  Dandelion has a cool decor with wood floors, high ceilings, and two levels of dining.  I can't forget to mention that they also play awesome music.    Both levels have comfortable seating, and the noise level is low during breakfast and lunch.  I expect it's worse during happy hour due to the ceilings.  Their staff are very friendly and welcoming, service is usually fast and efficient, and their food keeps me coming back again and again.  I've been here many times for lunch, and while their flatbreads and salads are good, I've found my favorite dish in their grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Wow - it's yummy, AND so reasonably priced!  I've never had a better grilled cheese/soup combo anywhere else...it's that good!  My hubby and I recently ventured here for Sunday brunch, and we really enjoyed our meal.  To start, their coffee is good and strong, and they serve biscuits and corn muffins with butter, honey, and jelly while you wait.  The biscuits are small and slightly crispy.  I loved them.  The corn muffins needed a bit of salt, however.   There are lots of options for breakfast, but we tried the huevos rancheros (hubby) and ham/gruyere omelet (me).  Both were very good!  The huevos was served in a cast iron skillet with shredded steak, beans, corn, and a spicy sauce; it came with tortillas, pico, and sour cream on the side.  The huevos was topped with a fried egg (over-easy on the menu, but they gladly gave my hubby one that was over-medium).  We love Mexican food for breakfast, and my hubby enjoyed their unique version.    My ham/gruyere omelet was light and fluffy, with just the right amount of filling.  I chose grits as my side, topped with shredded Parmesan.  The grits had some kick to them (maybe white pepper?), and I really liked their flavor.    I highly recommend Dandelion for lunch or brunch!  And we plan to try them for dinner as well, since that's the only meal we haven't yet had there.",

Somehow everyone ends up there so it is a great last spot to come to before heading home.   The daytime food side is an ok place for brunch but the appetizers a really great. I would suggest coming here on a weekend just to chill try some beer (they have samplers) and have some bites with friends.",

The food menu is a tapas approach with a wide variety of food.  3. The downer... the food was simply bland.      - The shrimp bruschetta was a complete myeh... come on chef, dare to present some unique flavors!!!     - The black beans sliders look great but, again, a flavorless mass of myeh!     - The red pepper dip was pretty decent but lacked zing! Whenever I start looking for sauces to add to a dish that means that nothing is baked into the original recipe.  A caveat... the other dishes may be simply awesome and we just happened upon the three items that were myeh... please prove me wrong with the other dishes.  4. Service is well done but the young lady who seated us was a bit grouchy... after we sat down we both laughed and told her, under our breath, Have a Nice Day!!!",

    "text": "The atmosphere was great and I thought the decorations and ambiance of the place were gorgeous. We went for dinner and the food was a little overpriced, but it was in downtown so one might expect that. The prices are on their online menu. There were many different plates to choose from to satisfy anyone.   The food itself was very good. I had fried pickles (very good) and the mustard ale cheddar sliders. The only thing I didn't like much about the sliders was that the bread and burger were slightly dry but the overall taste was good. My companion had the market macaroni and cheese and baked potato croquettes and enjoyed both. The horsey aioli served with the fried pickles was amazing.   The service was slow but the food came out fairly quickly. The waitress was friendly and got everything we needed, it just took awhile. It was quite loud but not enough to make me want to leave.   Overall, I would go back. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much. I am not of drinking age, but they had a large selection of alcohol for those who are. I didn't end up ordering it, but dessert is offered of you ask the waitress what they have. I'd say give this place a try!  One thing I thought was really neat that I have never seen before was the option of getting one of everything on the menu if you have a large group. It was $275 I believe and would be a lot of food as the dinner menu is pretty big. So if you have a large group and want to pass around and try everything, the option is there. I would probably call ahead for that anyway though. This is on the bottom of the menu but I haven't done this myself.",

I ordered the crab cakes Benedict, and I didn't know you could make crab taste bad, but they did. It was dry, old, and chewy. The hollandaise wasn't bad, but there was so little of it you almost didn't know it was there. I ordered a side of grits for $2.50, figuring they'd be worth the hefty price tag, but they were stale, tasteless, and so old and overcooked they were just a homogenized mush. It was a disgrace to one of the South's most sacred dishes.  Service was almost nonexistent. I had to ask another waitress for a refill of water because we never saw ours after we were seated.   Bonus? The waitress of the adjacent table sprayed cleaner in my direction, splashing me with chemicals that, judging by the immediate burning sensation, weren't meant to be applied directly to human skin.  All in all, the tab was skyrocket high for the quality, what service there was came with a frown or a spritz of chemicals, and we won't be back.",

    "text": "After reading all of the positive reviews about Dandelion Market on Yelp and seeing it busy every time we walked by the establishment, we finally decided to give it a try this past Saturday night.  Knowing that it's seemingly always busy on weekend nights, I called about a reservation.  Sadly, they didn't take any for parties under 8.  We decided to give it a shot and wait.    We showed up Saturday around 7:30.  I was surprised and happy to see that there was nobody waiting for a table by the hostess stand.  I informed one of the two hostesses there that we wanted a table for two.  She told me it was an hour to and hour and a half wait.  I looked around.  Yes, all of the tables were full...but there was nobody waiting for one either.  She then informed me that there was a bar area upstairs and we could sit up there if we wanted to.  I wasn't aware there was an upstairs at that point, but I was grateful for the additional seating.  We walked upstairs and found another large room with a long bar and a lot of additional tables.  The first thing we both noticed was how incredibly sticky the floor was.  It was like hundreds of sloppy drunk people spilled their drinks and nobody bothered to clean it up.  It reminded both of us of our college days, but that was for the small local bars when you don't care about cleanliness and are just out for a good time.    The bar only had random single seats, no two seats together.  There were two empty tables off to the side in the corner.  They weren't great, had awful lighting, and didn't provide much atmosphere as the rest of the (sticky) room.  Since it was our only option, we decided to sit in one.  Not long after, we were approached by a server informing us that we had to put our name on the waiting list for that table.  Interesting, since the hostess informed us that we could sit \"in the bar area upstairs\" if there were open seats.  And, if these were open tables, why wasn't anybody on the hour-to-an-hour-and-a-half waiting list being seated in them?    Attitudes from both the hostess and a server?  Sticky, unclean floors?  An hour and a half wait for...what?  That was enough for us.  The pretension was astounding.  We walked downstairs, passed three girls at the hostess doing nothing, and proceeded right out the door.  Nobody said anything to us, and they certainly didn't want to hear what I had to say.  Yes, my review is not about the food at the Dandelion Market, but it IS about the cleanliness and customer service, two qualities that I find very important in restaurants, both of which greatly affect my experience...and I thought you should know, too.  I guess Dandelion Market didn't want my money that evening, so I dropped $100 for the two of us elsewhere and we had a great dining experience.",

The balsamic vinaigrette is creamy (how of they do that) and delicious! My flatbread was delicious, cheesy and perfectly cooked! But I have to admit I was disappointed as all it had on there were sliced button mushrooms. I do not consider those wild mushrooms! Regardless it was tasty!

Dinner: I think I was a little overly excited to have found a place that had tapas here in Charlotte so I came in with positive expectations....and they really didn't disappoint!  They have a pretty good variety although I wouldn't really describe them as \"unique.\"  We tried the trio of spreads, stuffed zucchini, chicken roulade, and the grilled steak skewers.  Everything was very tasty!!  There were several other items I would like to try including the santa fe corn, baked potato croquettes and fried pickles!!    Lunch: It was mostly salads, sandwiches and soups....which is fine if that is what you are looking for!  Their turkey sandwich was big and plenty.  They certainly didn't skimp on the meat!  You get to choose a side---fries, salad, fruit etc.  It was overall a perfect lunch portion and satisfying.  Again, it wasn't amazing but it was very good.  I'm not in love with the atmosphere...I wish they had a few cushioned couches or booths but it is all wooden tables and some of them are right out in the open on the elevated seating area...so I felt too exposed.  I would have to agree with previous reviews that this would probably be the PERFECT late night spot.  It is more of a bar than a restaurant and it is somewhat of a dive sprinkled with a little bit of trendy.    I like this place and it serves a great purpose in Charlotte.  It would be fun to start here before dinner or end up here after you are looking for a midnight snack.  Enjoy!",

My favorites were the lamb lollipops, sweet and spicy green beans and the short rib. It was a wonderful first experience to get to try nearly everything so I know what to focus on when I go and have to actually pay!  There was a good selection of wine and beer and service was exceptional. Highly recommended!",

You can order a couple of things for yourself or order for the table and share (I think it's better to share so everyone gets a little bit of something). I'm a big fan of the lamb lollipops, mac and cheese and fries (which come out super crispy).   We went on a Tuesday when they had $15 wine bottle specials and they are well worth it (both the white and reds). Everyone got something a little bit different and had a bite, overall the bill was not astronomical and we all were full by the end. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a bit to eat or just drinks uptown.",

The side of fries was a generous portion, much better value than the hashbrowns which were really breakfast potatoes. The ketchup was very flavorful.

    "text": "Excellent quality small plates with wide selection of local beers. Great atmosphere and attentive servers as well.   We went on a Sunday evening (7-ish) and had no problem getting a window table even though the place was busy.   The waiter recommended 2-3 tapas per person. We selected 5 including brussels sprouts, hummus, shrimp and grits, chorizo fundido, and fried green caprese. We're not big eaters so 5 was the perfect number...six would've pushed us over the edge of comfort!  Our favorite was the hummus, topped with black olive tapenade, crisped garbonzos, and served with soft pita wedges. The hummus had just enough heat to make it interesting.   The S&G came in the form of a grit-cake with 2 huge grilled shrimp on top. We loved the taste but the grits had cream cheese mixed in so were definitely on the heavy side.  The Chorizo Fundido was more like a queso but was spicy and flavorful.   The FGC were hearty and paired with fresh mozzarella slices. Very good!  I only tried one of the brussels, which I don't care for, so I can't comment on how it compares.  In summary, my wife and I decreed that this is our new \"go to place!\" You should check it out!",

We got there around 11:30ish.  The bar downstairs was pretty dead at first, which was perfect.  That means no line to wait for drinks.  We got our drinks and went upstairs, where everyone was hanging out and dancing.  All of the bartenders were really friendly and were pretty fast in making the drinks.  They also did a great job with making good drinks super fast, so you never had to wait too long to get served.  The music was a ton of fun.  All songs that you can sing along to.  Even though I wasn't on the hunt, there were a TON of cute guys here.  To all the single ladies, this is the place you want to be on a Saturday night.  The crowd was fun, not rough.  Certainly a place you can get hit on buy a guy and score a few free drinks.  Dandelion seems to have done a great job as a crossover day-restaurant/night-bar.  Based on some of the other Yelp reviews, I'll have to come back here sober and try the food.",

This tapas bar definitely had larger 'small plate' portions than most other tapas restaurants that we've tried out.  Some of the plates were definitely fabulous!  The aioli that came with the calamari was delicious and the prosciutto crostini was a table favorite.  The Lamb lollipops were super yummy, as was the salad that they were served with.  The asparagus with the six minute egg were super and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious!  Some of the plates were duds- the queso fundido was passed on by one of the kids, and the potato dish, I can't even remember the name of it, was just yuck. The Brussels sprouts had a very nice flavor, but needed some caramelization or something.    Overall, a nice meal, definitely some pluses and some minuses, but good eats for sure.",

Come in early, and be prepared to get more than you expected because your eyes will be bigger than your appetite. The drinks here are amazing -- the Holy Water is my boyfriend's favorite, although I really liked the Twinkle Toes myself.  As for food, you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. It's split up into sections for small appetizer plates, staples, house favorites, and surf and turf. My boyfriend and I pick about 4 plates and that's enough for two -- and of course, if you have lots of guests for dinner (or just big appetites), you can get everything on the menu for $295. The last time we went, we ordered fried pickles (that horseradish aioli is amazing with the pickles), sliders (you get two), sweet potato gnocchi (soft, with a nice sweet potato and cinnamon background with the cream sauce), and the croquettes (perfectly fried and definitely reminded me of a baked potato, especially with the cream sauce that came with it.)  Plates come as they are ready and the service is great. They also feature amazing desserts -- we got a cookies and cream cheesecake and it was definitely a good end to an amazing dinner.",

After making AND confirming reservations for a party of 7 for a bachelorette party, your staff member knew and confirmed 7 did not meet the 8 minimum requirement and confirmed the reservation anyways. We show up, excited (keep in mind, there are many other places we could have chosen to go and we chose your restaurant) and ready to start a good night, only to be greeted with a questioning of our reservations and absolutely no apology or concern from your manager that there was a blatant mix up. Unbelievable! I love this restaurant and this was completely baffling to me. Such poor customer service. Poor management. And with no concern to help adjust the situation. I, myself, have recommended and/or had my own reservations for parties here. I will not be taking my service here again for gatherings and will not be recommending this as a staple visit for anyone in downtown Charlotte. Very disappointed from this experience and I hope management can handle situations like this in a better way, in the future. Better training is needed all around.",

Went on a Wednesday evening - no wait or reservation needed at normal dining hours. Atmosphere was a bit dark, but then again, I believe this doubles as a night scene/bar so that is acceptable. I want to start the discourse on food by saying the waitress we had was outstanding!!! She was knowledgeable about the menu, was able to provide good suggestions from personal experience and was attentive to the table's needs. The food was excellent and some dishes were very unique (I like trying new things). Will return if I'm in Charlotte again.",

I am not from Charlotte, so therefore not familiar with the best places to go or neighborhoods to seek out my kind of scene.  3. I do not do well in homogeneous environments.   So yeah, I didn't like this place. On the night I was there, it was disgustingly packed. As in, can't turn around, have to elbow people, feel really bad for the short people, feeling claustrophobic kind of crowded. It was insanely uncomfortable, especially because the crowd looked so... Stepford. If J. Crew doesn't make up the majority of your closet, don't expect to find your kind of crowd here. Just so you know.   Nothing they can do about that, I feel like it pervades most of Charlotte, but they *can* control the crowds. Even when we went downstairs we found ourselves standing in the entryway just for a little bit of breathing room.   They've got a fine beer list but when I asked for a second Two Hearted Ale they made a big deal about changing out the kegs and then proceeded to totally forget about me. I had to flag down another bartender after waiting for 10 minutes, and he poured me one straight up. Not sure what it is about this place that draws in such a large percentage of the city's population, but I think it's safe to say that I don't get it.",

Only downfall... It you can call it that. Would be the \"over easy eggs\". The yolk was completely cooked through. Now I know how easy it is to overcook an egg I do it practically every morning.

Downstairs at least it feels more like a bar than a restaurant - minimal decor, rustic, and loud.  The service was perfect, as were the drinks.  The selection of beers on tap is excellent, and there was a good selection of wine choices on a chalk board.  The idea that the tapas-style menu is not for the hungry is specious:   Two of us shared four plates and left stuffed (the waitress recommended sharing 2-3 plates per person).  The \"warm roasted olives\" are for the serious olive lover,  I like olives and my wife loves olives but we could hardly make a dent in the big pile of olives they delivered.  They were very tasty, however.  The trio of spreads was good, although none of the spreads was exceptional.  \"Ale simmered sausage bites\" in a hot mustard sauce were tasty, but incredibly simple.  The Quattro Framiggio flatbread was the most ordinary; if there was truffle oil as advertised it was overwhelmed by the carmelized onions, and overall the flatbread did not seem to be freshly prepared.  Based on what we had and what we saw on the menu, I would say that the food offered is not as creative as the menu descriptions.  I come back to the conclusion that the Dandelion Market is more a bar than a restaurant.",

I would have sent the steak back except for the fact they were trying to fit a HUGE party next to us... three women were crammed at the end of the table right next to us and we wanted to get the heck out... its a small place so I know its hard for a big group but its not cool to sit somebody basically on top of us... dont like butt in my face when I am eating.",

    "text": "I went back with a large group, and found a completely different restaurant. Actually, it wasn't so much that the restaurant had changed so much as the atmosphere now made sense. It was a Thursday night and we arrived at 7pm - early enough to beat the bar crowd. We were also seated upstairs, where the tables are a little farther from the bar, so that helped with the noise problem. But I think what really helped me was the realization that this is not the place for a quiet dinner; boisterous groups are a much better fit.  Also a plus, a large group means lots of pitchers of beer. That means trying four or five different brews. When a place has 25 beers on tap, you have to step up to the challenge.  There being ten of us, we had just enough to make the one-of-everything-for-$200 work. It made us all feel pretty swanky. Handling that many plates could be quite the ordeal, but with a couple of fun waiters the chaos was enjoyable. Some of the tapas, such as the cheese plate, are easily split amongst 10 people. But some are not. How do you share a house salad? Any ideas? I never saw how that was resolved, because a constant stream of food kept pulling my attention. The amount of food was just what the 10 of us could handle. The one-of-everything selection probably works for 10-12 Maybe 14 if you aren't too hungry. But there is nothing to stop a larger group from ordering the $200 deal and then adding extra plates of their favorites.  In the end, I probably tried two thirds of their plates. Some I loved (artichoke hearts, flatbreads) some I didn't (lamb popsicles) but I'll know for next time. Speaking of next time, I will certainly be back. I'll just know that this is a place best experienced with many many friends.",

Had drinks & dinner on Friday & partook in the Bloody Mary bar on Sunday.  All was a contrast in clientele.  Friday night downstairs bar was casual, relaxed, friendly service. Great craft beer selection was so cheap I kept insisting on paying.  I tend to do this every weekend I leave NY & get shocked all over again that a beer can be had for $5.  Amazing.  Anyway, didn't even realize there was more than the first floor till we were taken up for dinner.  Space turned into a bumpin-club-type-thing, replete with the ceremonial raising of a huge banquet table to make room for the band/revelers.  At that point it was super loud & packed, but our night was coming to an end, so no matter.  Food was mediocre at best, but completely fit the bill of greasy snacks to soak up the booze.  Basically they just deep fry every protein, veg or dairy product you could want.  The artichokes might even have been canned. all good, I ate those little suckers anyway.  Calamari, some type of non-bun burger deal & the flatbread should generally be avoided.    Sunday was also successful,  Quietly caught the end of the Bears game & had much fun mixing our Bloody's.  Cheers to the bartender with the heavy hand and for all-around general friendliness.",

Once we finally sat down- we asked about gluten free options as we are gluten-free. It was a very complicated process for them to locate the gluten-free list and provide that to us. The servers didn't have any knowledge of the menu and couldn't give us a direct answer about an item without going back and forth between the kitchen. While I really appreciated them double checking with the chef a few times, it was very annoying at the same time. Once the food finally came out, it was delicious! I just think the servers need more training on items on the menu and should really know which items are gluten-free and which aren't.",

The filling is less deviled eggy, and more like a pine nut hummus, at least on the day we went.   -Fried Pickles: GET! A huge order of sinful goodness with the perfect horseradish mayo accompaniment.   -Prosciutto Crostini: GET! Four crispy breads with goat cheese, fig spread, prosciutto and balsamic. Superb.   -BBQ Short Rib: may order again. It was VERY rich, and after an already full dinner, we couldn't finish it.  I would gladly return! This hit the spot and was a total winner, and there were a few other tapas I was highly interested in ordering!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined at Dandelion market for Yelp restaurant week. This was my first time having dinner there, and I won't be back.   The restaurant is located in Uptown (so I wouldn't suggest driving here unless you want to pay to park your car and then still have a good ways to walk). On a Monday evening the restaurant was empty, but the ambience was nice. Dandelion is located in a cool older building and boasts historic hardwood floors and dim lighting which is nice for a date night spot.  We liked only 2 of the 7 items we ordered. Additionally at a price tag of about $100 for a couple (including only a couple drinks) this place is not cheap, and there are far better tapas restaurants in Charlotte.   If you care for all the details; we tried a bunch of items: Brussels sprouts: I do not recommend. These were mushy and lacked any flavor - they weren't the fried or toasted Brussels you get at most restaurants. Cornbread: I would not recommend. It was So So dry and tasted like it had been made a week ago. Patatas Bravas: I would not recommend. These lacked flavor and tasted like they had been premade, left out, and reheated.  Wings: I did not try these (I'm not into wings) but my boyfriend said these were ok but not noteworthy. Prosciutto crostini: I WOULD recommend this. Of what we ordered it was the best (though that's not saying much). It was flavorful but super salty.  Stuffed Pepper: I would not recommend. This was poorly presented (looked like a pile of mush), it also didn't taste good. Apple Fritter desert: I WOULD recommend. This came with 2 fritters and vanilla ice cream. It was delicious and served hot!",

Dando features a tapas style dinner menu. I always order the stuffed poblano pepper. The lamb lollipops are another favorite. Honestly, I think I've had everything. Shrimp & grits, sweet & spicy green beans, fried pickles- depending on your mood, I don't really think you can go wrong. You can order \"Everything at the Market\" for $295. For lunch, I always get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It's perfection. Love their brunch- several egg bennie options, hangover hash, bloody mary bar ($7). Pro tip: make sure to ask about the quiche of the day!  Hours wise: dinner 7 days a week from 4-11pm, lunch Monday-Friday 11am-3pm, brunch Saturday-Sunday 10am-3pm. Bar is open until 2am. Couple dozen craft beers on draft and 25 wines for $25 a bottle.  After dinner, they pull the big community table upstairs up off the floor and up to the ceiling. Pretty cool. Great night spot for dancing. Even more importantly, it's an even better place for people watching. Enjoy.   Great staff here, the service is always top notch. With so many new places that continue to pop up in Charlotte and uptown, Dandelion is still a go-to spot for my friends and I.",

    "text": "Named for a Dublin landmark of the 1970s, Dandelion Market does little to evoke its Celtic lineage, but it is nevertheless a comfortable spot to grab a bite to eat. The dimly lit brick-walled interior, with its chalkboard specials and dried goods sacks on the walls, is the definition of cozy and quaint. The small plates dinner menu offers everything from appetizers to surf and turf to veggies and sides with a variety of culinary influences, leaving you free to cobble together a flavorful Frankenstein of a meal.  My wife and I rolled the dice with a spinach and artichoke dip, a fried green tomato caprese, a shrimp and grit cake, and a pork belly with a brownie-and-caramel-topped-ice cream combo for dessert. Some dishes were stronger than others, but the food was generally on-point. Dandelion Market does sauces very well, as both the fig balsamic accompanying the tomato and the peach-green tomato salsa accompanying the pork belly were excellent. The pork belly had a melt-in-your-mouth quality that I appreciated though my wife found it too fatty for her tastes. The bread that came with the dip was oven-fresh, and the ice cream betwixt the brownies offered some welcome vanilla bean notes that played well off of the salted caramel.  As with any tapas place, pricing can be a bit slippery. Most plates run $7-$12. Count on at least two per person, and it adds up. The skillful execution and artful plating take away some of the sting, and the efficient kitchen and attentive servers ensure you won't have long to wait between plates.  With an appealing menu, an inviting atmosphere, and a front-of-house and kitchen that both seem to know what they are doing, Dandelion Market has all the components needed to deliver a memorably good meal.",

Four of us shared some apps while the rest of the table fended for themselves (eh - the in-laws).  Food came out perfectly and with enough time to be finishing up one dish.  Yes - the food is tapas style (small plates that just come out whenever they're ready).  So, unless the entire table is ordering together, one half of the table may be finishing up before someone receives anything.  That happened - but just a risk you are willing to take.  The food was good...except the patatas bravas.  I love patatas bravas - I lived in Spain for awhile and they were one of my favorite dishes.  However, at Dandelion, they almost seem like a bad American take on patatas bravas.  Would I have them again - probably, because I love patatas bravas - but I'd likely still be disappointing.    Almost everyone enjoyed their meals (at least at my end of the table everyone did) - see in-laws :-\\    Great little date place though!",

My husband has small plate anxiety and refuses to share tapas but the serving size at dandelion is okay with him. We shared a couple sides and he got meatballs as his protein while I ordered the short ribs. Both were amazing. Every dish is beautiful and delicious. If you haven't had dinner here yet, you must!",

The next day (Sat, Feb 17) we went there for lunch. We were immediately greeted with smiles and salutations. We got seats right away. The waitress was extremely helpful offering suggestions and her thoughts on the menu as well as local beers. I had the Prosciutto Benny, and my wife had the Capreese Benny and got a side of the bacon cornbread. Everything was absolutely great. When they delivered our food I didn't receive my hash browns. I saw the person beside me had some with his Benny and presumed they came with the meal. I saw the manager walking buy and I inquired about the hash browns. She clarified that my meal didn't come with them, and I apologized for my mistake. She brought me and comped the hash browns even though it was my fault! Tremendous customer service! Definitely go!",

A definite hidden gem that I would be happy to get back to again. Why not five stars you ask, servers can be a little rude at times and can be MIA at times.

Fantastic and definitely my favorite dish of the night. Tender scallops and perfectly cooked pork belly on an absolutely flavorful bed of sauce and pesto.  -Sweet and Spicy Green Beans: 3.5/5. Fairly typical green beans served with a sweet, and very mildly spicy sauce.   I would definitely come back in the future. Great selection of beer too.",

My issue is that I've only been to Dandy when its after 12am and when I'm not really looking for a gourmet meal if you know what I mean...  I am also going to admit that my fears were unfounded. I went at 11am on a Sunday and the floors were not still sticky, there were no errant beer bottles rolling around, and there was no lingering sweat/stale beer smell in the air. I ordered a coffee to start (blue laws are the bane of my existence) and it came with a cute mini milk bottle full of cream. Refills were frequent and the coffee was on par with other brunch places in the area. I was pleasantly surprised when they brought over mini biscuits with apple butter and jam. The biscuits were a little overcooked but honestly any place that gives you free carbs as an appetizer is a winner in my book. I ended up ordering the migas as my meal because I can never have enough Mexican food in my life. The eggs were well cooked and spiced well. I was a bit confused on how they wanted me to eat them - as a taco? as a burrito? as nachos? I ended up eating them as scrambled eggs and ate the tortillas on the side. Overall, I definitely recommend Dandelion as a good option for brunch when you don't feel like waiting for a table at Zada Janes. I can't wait to go back and try their dinner/lunch menu as it looked delicious!",

    "text": "I love a tapas place as I often travel alone and these places allow me to add more variety to my meal. I was in the Queen City on business and my Yelp Mobile App led me here.  I liked this place enough to visit more than once.   This place has a nice dark pub atmosphere.  It was so dark that I actually needed to use the flashlight on my phone a time or two to see the menu.  To me the emphasis seems to be on the bar as opposed to the restaurant.  The tables actually look uncomfortable.  One of my visits was on a Monday night and $3 drafts were featured.  Every brew was #3 and that means about twenty taps.  That's a great deal and at 7:30 the place was packed.  The beer list is decent and well thought out.  It's not Flying Saucer crazy big but it's broad enough to satisfy most beer folks.  They also have a short list of specialty cocktails that they execute beautifully. The Cucumber Mint Mojito was excellent.  By the way, the bartenders here are excellent and customer service was never a problem.  The first tapa I ordered was the BAKED POTATO CROQUETTES - $6 that came with aged cheddar, Beeler's bacon and scallion cream. They arrived quickly and were plated beautifully.  They were good but not great.  None of the flavors had enough intensity to really tingle my taste buds.  They are missing something and the chef needs to think that through.  Next up was SAUSAGE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPER - $8 with Italian sausage, cheese, and house made crema.  Now this was more like it.  This dish was bursting with flavors that melded together perfectly.  I enjoyed every morsel.  Finally, on another visit, I tried the MUSTARD ALE CHEDDAR SLIDERS - $9 with Beeler's bacon and  l&t.  What was inside the bun was one of the best sliders I have ever tasted.  It was juicy, perfectly seasoned deliciousness.  Unfortunately the bun spoiled what could have been an amazing plate.  First it was cold which is totally unacceptable and second it was slightly dry.  What a shame. The bun should have been fresh and grilled.  One again this was a miss by the chef.  I want to love this place and it has a lot going for it. The atmosphere and the beers are right on.  The menu looks fantastic but the execution was flawed with two dishes I tried.  It's time for some attention to detail.  I can sense greatness but we're not quite there yet.",

Bottle of bubbly Grigio for $15, steal.

I found the menu to be full of healthy selections and refreshing, light lunches.  I had the Boars Head turkey sandwich on rye bread with a spinach salad for the side.  The sandwich came with the basics, tomato, lettuce and light mayo.  Nothing to write home about really regarding the sandwich but something to note is that it was a decent portion size and fresh, so no complaints.  The side salad was fine, a little overdone with the vinaigrette dressing and no real accouterments in the salad, strictly spinach leaves.  It was still fine.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu options soon :)",

Also the atpmospher was excellent, they really do a great job of giving it that old english world charm.  The only thing I would hold back on is the bean sliders.  They were good, but a real meat slider or  a pot pie would be perfect for this place. overall great service and a great atmospher!",

After looking at the menu here, we wondered if he'd be okay in a baseball cap, so we decided to walk by and feel.    The place was pretty empty, so we sidled up to the bar and ordered a pitcher of Abita Triple Haze, a more high-octane version of my favorite summer sipper, Purple Haze. Did I mention this place has an awesome beer selection?   For food, we chose the grilled lamb lollipops with black cherry, greens and feta vinaigrette, along with the proscuitto crostini topped with fig preserves and caramelized onions. Both were great! The lamb was a bit fruity for me (in fact I probably would have preferred it sans cherry), but then I ordered a dish with fruit. The crostini was a really nice balance of sweet, salty and savory. I definitely wanted to come back and try more food here.  Also, the service was super casual and friendly, as were the regulars hanging around. The bf mentioned he's new to town and everyone chimed with suggestions of things to do, good delivery, must-visit restaurants, etc.   In all, this was a great place for afternoon hanging. Can't wait to return!",

One of my employees was pregnant and in her third trimester so she was not able to stand for too long. Luckily for us, they had two comfy leather chairs in the dining area for her sit while we waited. The service took a little longer than you would expect for lunch. Everyone ordered a lunch combo or a salad. The sandwiches were large and looked delicious. I ordered the market salad $6 and added ahi tuna $6. It was one of the best salads I have ever had. They lightly toss it with a vinaigrette and I love goat cheese, dried cranberries, pine nuts, spring mix and of course, ahi tuna! The best salad ever! Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely.",

    "text": "Dandelion Market probably makes better margins on their lively nightlife, but this wallflower can't say for sure since bedtime's at 10.  I can, however, speak to their great lunches.    I first experienced their fantabulous ahi tuna salad with a really flavorful citrus vinegarette. My lunchmate raved about the tomato soup and grilled cheese that I tried yesterday and it was classic unhealthy comfort food. I really liked the robust flavor of the soup.  My favorite salad, though, the caprese has been taken off the menu. I don't know if they might bring it back in a future menu. The aged balsamic is so sweet and complemented the generous helping on mozzarella and cherry tomatoes, on top of mixed greens. Yum. Please bring it back!    The Stud had the Rustica which was OK (probably better toasted), but wouldn't recommend it. They did recommend the roast beef.    I've also heard great things about the brunch, but they didn't have the leanest options for brunch, so I bet it would be a good place for a hangover.       The service is always friendly and attentive.  One time I had an issue with the quality of an ingredient and they took care of it swiftly and impressively. The interior  hasn't changed that much since La Torres, but it's got a good vibe, though still feels a bit like a dingy bar. For salads that good, I'll take it.",

Some chefs get adventurous in a bad way, but this menu is definitely a winner.   wild mushrooms: incredible taste, cooked perfectly chicken wings: better than average, but this dish really excelled due to the custom ranch. I didn't know ranch could be made to taste like that! lamb lollipops: small portion (half-rack is two ribs), but the cherry sauce is insane. The lamb meat was good by itself, fairly little seasoning so you're mainly getting lamb meat and a really tasty sauce buttered scallops: 3 scallops to a plate, but they are incredible. Quite buttery, but the low # of scallops keeps you from being overwhelmed. They are cooked quite well, not soggy at all  Our bill would have been ~$40 for these 4 dishes, but with a coupon came out to $20.  I would definitely go again",

    "text": "This is a nice, funky tapas-style eatery in uptown. But I think the food's a little pricey and the portions too large to be a traditional tapas place. My GF and I ordered three plates each, thinking that we'd order more, but the portions were so large that the six were more than enough. The frites and calamari, for example, were as large as a standard appetizer at a \"regular\" restaurant. I'm sure Dandelion Market has run the numbers and decided that this is the way to go; however I would have preferred it if the portions and prices were split in half, so I could try a greater variety of things. Then again, my GF is mostly vegetarian and I am not - perhaps if we ate with a few more friends the cost would even out more.  Having said all that, the food was good. The Ale Simmered Sausage bites weren't as warm as I would have hoped, but the sauce was delicious. The calamari was tender and well-cooked. The sliders were delicious, although the toppings threatened to overwhelm the meat. The frites were perfectly cooked and delicious. The baked potato croquettes were tasty and homey. The fried pickles were great, albeit with an \"upscale\" take. The beer menu is nice and well thought out. The service was friendly and efficient. The decor was funky - a mix of old Dublin pub and modern hipster hangout (old burlap sacks stretched and and hung like pictures, or example).  My only complaint (save what I wrote in the first paragraph) is that this place might prove to be a bit.. twee for Charlotteans.",

When I looked online their menu looked delicious and I thought it'd be a great choice for me and my wife to go celebrate our anniversary; bad idea. First of all this place is not terrible. The food is fairly good, (ribs, crab/avocado stack, and butternut squash were good but the cheese board and southern caprese were disappointing) the beer is cold (my wife enjoyed her cocktail) and the service was exceptional. What ruined this place for me was the noise level, which was nauseatingly loud. All of the seating (including the bar) is in a small area so I understand it could be noisier than usual but they turn up the music and promote a louder atmosphere. Me and my wife could barely have a conversation and the party next to us was nearly screaming at each other. They had a game up on at the bar which encouraged a bunch of dudebros to constantly yell at the television. This was the first time I ever got a headache because of a noise level in a restaurant and it completely ruined the evening for me. Please don't advertise yourself as a \"romantic\" date night like you do on your website and then create a loud and obnoxious atmosphere like this.",

Amanda was our waitress and took good care of us and, I think, got some food running help from the back of the house which was nice to see. We liked the portabello mushroom 'fries' and the spinach salad was good. Both the Dando Ribs and a side of Mac n' Cheese were good and quite generous portions; one question though, why are the ribs offered KC or Memphis style instead of NC style? for a visitor from MA this felt like a missed opportunity. Since I had ribs in Memphis a few years ago I went for KC which are wet (as described) and good but I'm pretty sure I would have liked the Memphis even more. The Sweet & Spicy green beans were cooked well and had the sweet but lacked the spicy. One thing to be aware of, it wasn't even that busy when we were here but it was pretty loud. I imagine that when it's real busy the wood floors and hard surfaces (we were downstairs, I think they also have an upstairs dining area ) make conversation very difficult.",

Thats the highlight. The waitress took a while to get to us. I am not sure if she was the only one there but if thats the case they need to hire more people. When she finally came over we both order the scrambled eggs w/ potatoes and peppers. We thought this would fill us up. When it came out the whole thing was inside of a very small cast iron skillet. I was speechless. I decided to give it a chance and boy was I disappointed. Flavorless, and way too hot. No amount of salt or pepper would save it.  My girlfriend was still hungry so she ordered a side of potatoes.  She said they were okay, but I did not try them. I was too mad about this \"culinary crime\" that had been perpetrated on me.  The decor was even questionable.  I have no clue what this place is trying to be. Is it a bar, a restaurant, a lounge, an eclectic hangout for non-conformist.

    "text": "Wandered into the Dandelion after a long flight from Seattle to Charlotte, and was pleasantly surprised by the place.  Looks like most other Irish (or pseudo-Irish) bars, but the gent behind the bar had a rather authentic accent, which is usually a decent sign of things to come.  I had wandered in during happy hour, which I discovered is an excellent time to join the festivities, since they have $3 drafts - any beer.  I tried a local Amber by Birdsong, then a traditional Belgian dark/sour called Klokke Roeland.  Both beers were great buys for the price.  As to food, I ordered fried pickles (being in the South, that's a must), some fries, and their Mustard Ale Cheddar sliders.  The servings were GIGANTIC - definitely not what I had expected from a tapas menu, and could easily have served three people, not just one or two.  The fried pickles were pretty good, but the dipping sauce made up for the lack of \"dilliness\" that I like in my pickles.  The fries were amazing, but I couldn't even make a dent in the serving.  But the sliders.  Oh.  My.  God.  The bacon on them was awesome, they weren't over-cheesed like so many burgers can be, and the meat on them was so juicy.  Plus, they were HUGE...I managed to down one and a half, which is why I couldn't dent the fries.  Walked out with a bill under $30, which is rare when traveling and heading out for a dinner on the town.  Would highly recommend the place for anyone looking for tapas-plus.",

I had chicken wings and chips. both were great.  the wings had a classy kick to them and the chips were thick and well cooked.  I was surprised that a new place had such spot on dishes.  I didn't notice many \"just opened\" issues and the bartenders were extremely attentive.  nothing worse than going into a place and there is some piece of candy (male or female)  behind the bar texting or just ignoring patrons. not here, all business.  the selection of draft beers is probably the best in town and i look forward to trying them all.   the upstairs is surprisingly large and doesn't have that \"smoked in\" smell/feel that some older (&fun) places have.   the local owners worked hard to make this place stand out and it shows. great food, great service and a great atmosphere.

    "text": "Went to the Dandelion Market because of the good reviews. I don't know if the people had too much to drink or have low standards, but I was not impressed. The atmosphere is drab black and dark. It is noisy as it has nothing to absorb the noise, the floors are wooden and it is sparsley furnished (we were upstairs). We were trying to eat the overpriced tapas and have a decent conversation with friends when all of the sudden the employees started making a huge scene while they dramatically lifted a long table off of the floor to the ceiling I guess to make room for all the partiers that they expected to come into the place, with no where to sit, standing room only. The food was so so. I couldn't believe they had mac and cheese as a tapas. It was like the frozen Stouffers kind. There were a few good ones, but for the most part, I felt we had to order 10 tapas to feed the four of us, the servings were so small. Not a very good wine selection. It is more of a bar than a place to go and eat and have a conversation with friends. I prefer to walk around the corner and go to the Wooden Vine for my wine and tapas with friends.",

Go for lunch instead of dinner tho, as the lunch menu consists of some good salads and sandwiches, but the dinner menu has some really unique items (try 'everything but the bun' if you can!)

    "text": "I absolutely adore this restaurant! They take effortless simplicity to a whole new level, especially in the uptown area where everything is overwhelming and has the \"trying too hard\" vibe. The interior on the first floor is spacious, all dark wood, dim lighting, and a decent-sized, rounded bar area. It's allows you to feel intimate without being overcrowded. I invited a group of friends out for my birthday and chose Dandelion Market because it is large enough to accommodate a group of 10 but without that chain restaurant feel. I'm definitely a NoDa fan because I love the small eclectic feel of the restaurants there, but the places there are always so small and never take reservations. This restaurant seemed to have the atmosphere with the accommodations that I was looking for. They greeted us and had our table set up within 5-10 minutes.   Their menu is a \"tapas style,\" or small plates but with a modern twist and a southern flair. Everything from a cheese plate to shrimp and grits. I get worried about tapas, especially in large groups, because as soon as I share I rarely have enough for myself. However, their plates were generously portioned that sharing was never an issue. I also love variety so this menu was perfect. I got the cheese plate, which came with honeycomb that I thought was pretty unique. I also got the macaroni and cheese, which was amazing and the calamari, which had more than enough to share. The shrimp and grits were definitely the favorite of the table. The grits come in a cake style with jumbo sauteed shrimp. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the macaroni and cheese was baked with the crunchy decadence I look for in that kind of dish. BONUS: the dishes are reasonable priced, even if you want a lot or a little.  Their specialty drinks were a little on the sweet side for me, so I stuck with a classic cosmopolitan (hey, it was my birthday!). We also ordered shots, so I felt the classy with party style was well balanced. Their wine is also well priced.   The service was okay, there were a few times I needed a drink refill and had a hard time finding the server, but we didn't have any issues with the service and I felt comfortable being able to socialize with my group of friends without feeling like we needed to fit the intimate atmosphere.   We went upstairs to the bar after dinner and while it was a nice bar with the same theme, it was brighter and less comfortable for just drinking at a bar. The only problem is that when we told the server we were just looking to get some drinks she suggested we try another bar nearby, making us feel a little unwelcome, so we left.   Overall, Dandelion Market was a great experience that even friends who have lived in the Charlotte area for years were surprised about. It's definitely an unknown gem in the uptown area, which is mostly full of loud clubs or uninspiring pubs.",

    "text": "Instead of hitting the standard chain food fare we wanted to take a couple of our friend's visiting from out of town to a local restaurant.   Our second visit to the Dandelion Market for dinner on a Friday night was a different experience than the first.  After our first visit we played a little safe by selecting some items we thought one couldn't really go wrong with.  First, \"Baked Potato\" Croquettes.  No complaints.  Well cooked, lightly brown, fresh oil.  We went again for the Grilled Steak Skewers.  This time cooked perfectly.  Finally, the risotto special.  I wish this could be a standard item.    Lastly, our friends wanted one more item to top off their dinner so they inquired about the calamari.  The waitress told us very honestly, it completely depends on whose cooking it.  Indeed!  That could certainly explain the vast difference between the two visits.  The calamari did not disappoint.  This time as we watched food come out to the tables around us we actually wanted what they ordered!  Including the dessert which we regretfully didn't have room for.  Next time!  It would probably be in the best interest of the owners to have their best chef spend some time training the others to share the love and deliver a consistent product every time.  Consistently good food is what people are looking for in a restaurant!",

It was a great find. I first thought it was going to be a lady's luncheon place, but it surely was nothing of the sort.   They have tapas and plenty of drinks. The tapas are of good size and are quite good. The prices were also pretty affordable. But this might be me comparing it to LA.  I would say almost 4 out of 5. Like 3.75 out of 5. Wait staff is a 5 out of 5 and same with the ambience. I would definitely go back and would suggest others to try it out for themselves. Good for groups or even just for a couple.",

The first off-putting thing was the hostess, who seemed out of it when we arrived and didn't fully engage us, no biggie but for a place that I thought was supposed to be a little extra nice, or even cool, this is a small ding. We sat upstairs and again, it's a great space. Was 7ish on Saturday night and wasn't that busy. We ordered the roasted olives, deconstructed caprese, portabella fries, ahi and steak skewers. The olives were good and lot's of them; nice to have on the table for the rest of the meal. The fries came out next and were really tasty, the homemade ketchup is awesome, I think they were fried with panko crumbs, was reminiscent of tempura. The caprese was a letdown; the fried balls of mozz really masked the flavor of the cheese and there were only small bits of basil on the tomatoes. Overall an experiment gone wrong with a classic appetizer and one that we in particular love. Ahi tuna was done perfectly, complaint here being the wasabi sauce does not have enought wasabi; not enough heat. Steak skewers were tasty, korean style. We asked about dessert and were disappointed to find no chocolate representation aside from chocolate ice cream. Chocoholics beware. Overall the food was good but not great. I had high expectations after having heard many great things from friends. Another thing that really bothered me was that as small plate after small plate kept coming out, none were cleared from our table. We had to pile them up ourselves. What's up with that? A perfectly fine place, several other dishes I would like to try. Still not a breakthrough restaurant for Charlotte.",

The service was not good. We had a table of six & our server took an order for 2 ( SMALL ) plates & didn't return to take orders for more for nearly 15 minutes when we initially wanted to order 6 plates. She just kinda took the order for 2 & left. The fried pickles & the zucchini ribbon pasta were excellent!  The black bean sliders should have gone back! They were pasty & flavorless. The crab & avocado was in desperate need of salt & the sauce did not complement well. The fried green tomatoes were also in disparate need of salt & the breading was too heavy. The shrimp & grits were very good! The pumpkin cheesecake was delicious except the oatmeal cookie crust was so think and hard I literally have to hammer it with my spoon to brake it up in order to eat.  The Long Island drink was not the worst but nothing to rave about either.",

Casual, pub-style eatery but the menu is anything but average pub&grub. Brunch is my favorite here thanks to the tasty Migas and bloody mary bar.  Not traditional tapas, but certainly small plate style.  Good for sharing. Full list of $25 bottles of wine. Last visit each of us ( 4 people) chose one item  and it was perfect for a late night post-movie bite.  The service is consistently friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "My recent visit to Dandelion was the 4th time that I have been there.  It was also the last time that I will go there.  I've had better experiences here.  But never good enough to offset poor food that I was served at this last visit.    The Good:  Nice selection of beer.  Pretty chill atmosphere.  Decent service.    The Bad.  The Food.  The Food.  The Food.    We started with the calamari.  Meh.  Why I keep taking risks with calamari is beyond me.  It's rarely impressive and is often has blase as can be. But when it's good (like at Bentley's) I really do enjoy it.  And it's something that should be pretty hard to screw up.  But Dandelion's calamari was mediocre at best.    I thought the Portobello fries sounded interesting.  I was Oh So Wrong!  I love a big meaty Portobello on the grill.  I was hopeful that this dish would have a similarly robust flavor.  It was very disappointing.    Mussels are another thing that I keep trying all over town and it appears that there are only a couple of places (like the Liberty) that consistently get them right.  Dandelion's rendition was subpar.     We finished with a dish that just had to be good - The Crab and Avocado salad.  Crab + avocado + citrus is a combination that one just can't go wrong with, right?  WRONG!!!  I was shocked at how bland this dish was.  Nothing about it was good - not the presentation, or the texture, and certainly Not the flavor.    Then today as I was paying my credit card bill, Dandelion Market gave me on last swift kick to the groin.  It was bad enough that I wasted $72 on a very poor meal.  But Why did the server add on an additional $0.67 to her tip?  Okay, maybe it was a mistake and I really don't care about $0.67.  It's the principal of it.",

The lunch menu is simple, but delicious and well presented. Over the course of 3 visits in parties of 4+, everyone has loved their food. From the simple touches of \"Guinness spiced ketchup\" to the super crispy fries, everything is fantastic food wise.  What is not fantastic is that the lunch plates costs $8-10, and will run you $12-15 after taxes and tip. It is definitely competitive in the uptown lunch space for quality of food within that price range, but at the same time, uptown Charlotte has many overpriced lunch eateries.  Using <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>, you can average down the bill for Dandelion to $8-10 after tax and tip, which makes it much more exciting to frequently visit.

The seared scallops with arugula was great as well as the mac and cheese which comes piping hot in its own bakeware. Good selection of drinks as well, I had the \"winter-fashioned\".

The prices were way too high for the ho hum I was served. On my last visit, the give them one more shot time?

    "text": "Dandelion Market was around the corner from the condo I was staying in for the week. Actually, there were several amazing places within the surrounding block and it was difficult to choose where to go. I took a seat at the bar, but quickly made the decision to move to a table as this wasn't the most friendly dining bar. I'm sure on a normal night, it would be just fine, but there seemed to be a couple large holiday parties going on while I was there as well.   It was truly difficult to choose what I wanted to order; everything looked so tempting. But being a solo diner, I didn't want to over order in any way. Definitely will come back here with a dining buddy or two and explore a lot more of the menu. For this evening's adventure I went with the Southern Caprese and the Mustard Ale Sliders. For my beverage, I chose the Winter Fashioned.   The Winter (Old) Fashioned was delicious and well-balanced. It wasn't too bitter, but just the right amount of sweet to make a nice finish on the palate. My caprese arrived first: fried green tomatoes, fresh mozz & a fig basalmic. It was hard not to pick it up with my hands and shove it in my mouth. I did the polite thing & took small bites. I would have licked the plate too if I wouldn't have garnered stares from my dining neighbors. The sliders came out quickly after they were ordered & I dove right in. They were cooked perfectly and the 'extras' didn't impede on the experience. The cheese & bacon were in perfect proportion and you got a little bit with each little bite.  While dessert was tempting, I was sated, so I called it a night and rolled myself home.",

I feel like there wasn't enough bread on the bottom, but I really enjoyed the hollandaise sauce & the bread that it came on though! I tried some of the hash browns, and grits lorrrd the hash browns were SO salty!! But the grits were really interesting, it tasted like there was corn bits in it? Very good! But the service was supppper slow. Mind you there like 2 tables in there including ours but our server was so. slow.

Happened to accidentally show up on \"Wine Night\" which was a great perk. All their bottles of wine were $15 instead of $25. A great deal! The fact that they even do that is really great. And on a Tuesday night it was totally packed! (Not sure if that's a normal weeknight or if everyone was there for their cheap bottles of wine.) Atmosphere was great!! And the service was really good too.   My & a friend shared four tapas (small plates) and they were all really good and turned out to be a pretty decent portion. Didn't leave stuffed but definitely didn't leave hungry either. Perfect.  - Sweet Potato Gnocchi - wasn't my choice (I'm not a huge gnocchi fan) but had a good flavor and came in a little skillet that was a decent tapas portion. - Sausage Stuffed Pepper - was delicious! Not my choice either, but was *one of* my favorite things! Had a little spice and was a filling small plate. - Southern Caprese - fried green tomatoes with homemade pesto mozzarella. It was really as delicious as it sounds! Definitely try this! - Shrimp & Grits - was grit cakes with goat cheese on top and really well done shrimp. Delicious! Maybe my favorite thing of the night!",

However the upstairs dining area was great and not too noisy, I'd recommend that instead of downstairs if your ears are assaulted when you walk in. Also it's dimly lit if your date's looks aren't doing it for you.  The drink specials are really good, you can share bottles of wine on the cheap with your dinner. However the chef might be trying too hard to be edgy on some of these dishes and they are definitely not described adequately. The menu rattles off their ingredients however fails to describe the actual dish. Shrimp and Grits for example sounds pretty good with goat cheese, and red pepper cream sauce on the menu right? The grits are fried and reminiscent of the french toast sticks I got served in the cafeteria in middle school. Surprises are fun except with food you've ordered.  Everything however is fairly priced and 2 tapas were enough to satiate my appetite. I recommend asking what you are ordering before you place it here unless you like surprises, otherwise it's a very nice place to grab a bite and drinks.",

Upstairs is cozy with booths, a bar, and the longest, most beautiful farm table I've ever seen.   I'm not always a huge fan of small plates because it feels like you can never get enough and they're so expensive, but they are SO worth it here. Shout outs to the pan seared ahi tuna, shrimp and grits (unbelievable grit cakes), and lamb kabobs. Potato croquettes were nothing to write home about.   Service was great each time, and I appreciated how quickly they accommodated us as soon as they opened. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone living in or visiting Charlotte!",

There's a small bar with beers on tap and many wines to choose from, as well as an open-spaced dining room.  The menu is designed tapas-style so they encourage to order 2-3 dishes per person. We split 4 dishes between the two of us and a beer flight and it came to just around $60.  The shrimp and grits and the lamb lollipops were my absolute favorite,very memorable and super delicious!  Great for a date night, drinks with friends, or a small group outing!",

Food: My favorites: Pan seared ahi tuna (nothing too unique but it was executed SO well. The tuna was fresh, seared and perfectly rare in the middle and the wasabi aioli, a delicious complement), and the baked potato croquettes (4 perfectly battered and fried baby potatoes served with scallion sour cream). We also tried (in order of preference): the roasted garlic hummus (comes with a pail of pita and a hummus spread, half covered in crispy chickpeas, half in olives), pan seared scallops (comes with 3 scallops on a bed of sweet potato puree -- this dish included everything that I loved, but I wasn't blown away by the execution; it didn't have the nice sear that I was longing for, was slightly overcooked, which didn't go super well with the texture and thickness of the puree), dando brussel sprouts (I wish they were more crispy and carmelized than they were!), and grilled steak skewers (comes with 2 skewers; this one was super underwhelming, very generic).  Service: The service was awesome.   Ambiance: The interior is dimly lit, with exposed brick, and nice big, rustic wooden tables.   Will definitely be back to try out other options on their menu and another round of the ahi tuna and baked potato croquettes!",

    "text": "Dandelion market was a fun experience ! I went here with a group of about 25 people from work and they have a large enough space to accommodate multiple large groups/parties at once. The menu is tapas/small plates so kinda designed to share. I tried the mediterranean trio, szechuan string beans, sweet potato gnocchi, black bean sliders along with tiramisu, apple cheesecake and the brownie sundae. The only things I was disappointed with was the dessert menu, and ofcourse the desserts themselves. Shouldn't it be very hard to mess up a simple classic chocolate brownie? Well, theirs was hard and a little bland. The tiramisu was more whipped cream than anything, very very sweet and with hardy any coffee flavor. The cheesecake I liked! All the savory dishes we ordered were delicious too - my fav being the sweet potato gnocchi. This was HEAVENLY! You only get a couple pieces of gnocchi per serving so beware, because you will get hooked.  I was too excited to talk about the food and now that I have it out in the open, I will proceed to say that we got excellent service. Our server was very sweet and helpful and attentive even though we were a large group and clearly not very easy to manage. They have wooden interiors that impart a very intimate, cozy feeling to the restaurant. Love it!  Did I mention they have a kickass cocktails menu? :)",

This isn't one of those places, and the cocktails aren't terribly special...but they are priced as if they are.  Beer menu isn't terribly varied, wanted a stout I hadn't had before, ended up with a NoDa porter I've had 100 times.  It's good, just wanted something new.  Waiter didn't understand beer styles, so he was useless.  No, I do not want a black lager as a substitute, thank you.  Tapas, huh?  What this means is full price for half of a plate with no sides.  My beef skewers were fantastic, but they were pretty small.  Sure glad I got to fill up on fries (not).  I'm not normally overly sensitive, but where we were sitting had an incredible odor of mold, that sure didn't help.  I'll give it another shot and update accordingly depending on how it goes.",

For my Hair of the Dog, I ordered the Market Mimosa, which had blackberries in it, and it was a unique, but delicious, twist on a classic mimosa. I selected the Huevos Rancheros as my entree. The presentation was immaculate; the tortillas came folded with a side of pico de gallo and sour cream to dress the steak and eggs. It all worked perfectly together! I ordered a side of grits, because the waitress recommended them as one of her favorite menu items and it was GREAT advice! Some of the best grits I've ever had! They were delicious.

We had a small wait for a table of four. The space does seem a little small for lunch time and typically the upstairs isn't open at this time. At this time of day you can order small plates or from the lunch menu.   I was super impressed that there were so many veggie friendly options. Recently I've switched to a plant-based diet and eating out can be hard. I actually had options here! I ordered a portabella sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was delicious. The mushroom wasn't too rubbery or juicy. The pesto sauce and garlic  aoili were nice additions. And the ciabbata bread was a perfect match. The salad was also good, but pretty basic with mixed spring greens and cherry tomatoes and a basalmic vinegrette on the side. As a meal, it was very satisfying.   I'd love to come back for brunch sometime. But I highly recommend Dandelion Market for any occassion.",

My wife and I tried two apps and two entrees. We did a order of their sweet and spicy green beans. They were good, I thought more sweet than spicy. The Calamari our waiter recommend and he was right they did have a good crisp and flavor. They are only the ring so if your a tentacle fan you will have to fine somewhere else.   The entrees we chose the Lamb and the scallops. The scallops had a great sear on them. It is a fine line of a good sear and over cooked and they played it perfectly. The lamp was a perfect rare temp (which my wife prefers. I am more of a Med-rare.) My wife got an order of the sweet potatoes which I do not like however they tasted more like pumpkin so I didn't mind them. I ordered the Croquettes after the waiter said the Mac & Cheese is inconsistent. They were good but only came with four. Overall I was satisfied and would go back again.",

There were stairs to an upstairs area, but we did not venture up there. Parking was available on the metered spots a few streets down, but beware of trying to find parking on a busy night.

We went around 6:15 pm on a Friday, a party of 8, and enjoyed ourselves for a little over 90 minutes.  The Mac and Cheese was PHENOMENAL. Such a wonderful flavor. It was big enough to share with a second person but you can totally chow this down on your own. The only part of the evening that I observed is how the two hostesses at the front lacked enthusiasm or alertness at times. 2 people out of our 8 person party were running late and they would seat us at our table. When we asked if we could be seated, they didn't give us a definite answer or say it's policy. That's the only part that I really didn't appreciate how it was handled but I get it. Overall, it was great. I drank Bold Rock cider and throughly enjoyed ever sip I took. The atmosphere was beautiful. I love how dimmed the last were. That's my type of ambience.   We brought friends from Utah who were pleased with the experience. I'm looking forward to stopping by again in the future. Will have to explore the menu a bit more.",

They screwed up my friend's 50th Birthday Party Reservation and actually had the audacity to tell us they reserved \"floor space\" for us in the upstairs room where a bridal party reception had all the tables and booths reserved! Not wheelchair accessible either! I would never go back here or trust this place for a reservation after the way our party of 20 was treated!",

Definitely order: *Shrimp & Grits (9) - not to tomatoey, the grits was a polenta cake, best tapa *Sweet & Spicy Green Beans (7) - Szechuan sauce, macadamia nuts, slighly sweet and spicy, great crunch *Sweet Potato Gnocchi (8.5) - great texture and sweet potato flavor *Meatballs Marinara (9) - very lean meat, great tapa! *Pan Seared Scallops (17) - the collard greens were great while the pineapple was an interesting topping, perfectly cooked scallop  Try at your own discretion: *Prosciutto Crostinis (9) - more of a baguette than a crostini, came out soggy and heavy *Cured Meat & Cheese Board (14) - average board with 3 meats, 3 cheeses, baguette, honey comb, blackberry jam, spicy mustard *Arugula Salad (10) - spiced watermelon, cornbread croutons, feta, lemon vinaigrette, very light and the flavors are untouched *Zucchini Pasta (8) -spiral zucchini, pickled beets, pumpkin seeds, basil, smoked tomato vinaigrette, if you get the meatballs, that marinara makes this a lot better, cold pasta, wasn't memorable  Wasn't a fan of having to trek upstairs to be seated when the downstairs area had availability. Friendly service. Twinkle toes ($10) cranberry prosecco was good. Clean bathroom. There are plenty of tapas restaurants in Charlotte and Dandelion Market features fusion flavors like the green beans and the scallops but does a great job maintaining core flavors too - like the meatballs and arugula salad.  Stop by if you're not too adventurous or if you have a big group that wants to try it all for $295!",

Another thing to stay away from. Pork belly another waste of time just pour bbq sauce all over fatty meat. Had the croquettes just tasted like fried potatoes very greasy. And as for there ravioli apple desert just take an apple pie and pour tons of cinnamon and sugar on it because that's what I got and it was cold. Also cocktails we each had a martini and it's hard to screw one up but they did. Asked to fix it by having a small glass of pineapple juice and was charged for it. I won't be back.",

We then ordered the prosciutto crostini, sweet potato gnocchi, meatballs, sausage stuffed poblano, and we added the fried pickles on the waitresses recommendation. The prosciutto crostini was AMAZING. The flavor combination of goat cheese, salty prosciutto, caramelized onion and semi-crunchy crostini was perfect  I could've eaten the whole order myself and enjoyed every bite! The fried pickles were also perfect with a horseradish aioli as the perfect accompaniment. Yum! The sweet potato gnocchi were great, but I wish the portion was bigger - it seemed like only a few gnocchi were there and that was disappointing but the flavors were great. The meatballs were good but my least favorite item we ordered - but I loved everything so you really can't go wrong! The sausage stuffed poblano, ordered after reading Nikki W's review, was bomb! Soooo delicious, spicy, and the tomato sauce was be perfect balance of sweet, delicious acidity. Our bill came to $58 before tip and we were perfectly satisfied! We will definitely be back. Ideally, we would love to order the entire menu on a future visit!! Thank you for a great din",

Thick crusty well buttered artisanal bread with gooey insanely yummy cheese and a proper thick tomato soup, none of that watery from a can drips all over you soup.  My boyfriend actually stole some of my soup with his fork over the table and it didn't leave the fork, that thick.  He had the most monstrous chicken salad on a croissant sandwich i'd ever seen.  I don't know what dressing they use on their salads but it was yummy.   We met up for lunch uptown during the work week and it was well worth it.  The service was surprisingly quick and the food wasn't very expensive.   We didn't get a beer (kind of frowned upon mid afternoon during working hours!) but we have been many times for a pint and their selection is diverse and full of craft brews.  What I love most about The Dando is that the lower bar and the upper bar have completely different feels to them.  The lower bar is more small restaurant/pub and the upstairs is perfectly suited for a night out with the girls and saturday nights.  forgot to add: for those of you who work in uptown, they have a punch card for lunch!",

In the evening the place is a little confused: is it a restaruant? a pub? a dance club? a rave? depends on the night and the patronage. I tend to like my places a little better defined.

Fortunately I had the good sense to come in out of the rain for once.  Dandelion makes an interesting first impression: the wall to your immediate right boasts a wall of shoe trees -- enough of them that I asked the bartender if there was some significance to the art installation. Nope, he said, they were pretty much just a wall of shoe trees.   Hmm. Okay.  That said, upstairs plays differently from the more traditional Irish style pub on the first floor: dark, ambient, warm by virtue of its heavy wooden overtones, the acoustic act playing guitar when I stopped in seemed appropriate to the pervading vibe of the room. If I were around more often, it's pretty safe to suggest that upstairs at Dandelion Market might become a regular hang. As it is, I'll look forward to popping back in next time I'm in.",

Each server has been friendly and competent.  The beer selection here is solid.  I am impressed that they have a good number of regional craft brews on tap here.   I love tapas-style dining.  I would prefer to graze than to just put my head in a feed bag and chow down on some oversized portion of something.  The quality of food preparation here is pretty consistent.  There are some menu items that I have not liked, but it was simply personal taste and not due to anything going awry in the kitchen.  Here's my \"gripe\" with Dandelion:  I've been 5 or 6 times now and have eaten nearly everything on the menu.  Some things I want to eat a second or third time, but I no longer sit at home and think that I'm dying to eat at DM because I haven't tried \"x\" yet.  Again, this is not because the food tastes bad.  The food is great.  I would just like to see some menu rotation.  But perhaps there is rotation and I've just missed it.    If you've never eaten at Dandelion Market I highly recommend it.  It's a great restaurant and with some seasonal menu changes I'd give it 4 or 5 stars.",

The first time my husband and I went we got the beer sampler and for tapas we shared the trio of spreads (hummus is delish!), pan seared ahi tuna, and market meatballs. Oh and I'm pretty sure I threw in the market mac and cheese for good measure! I will admit that I went late night with a few friends and got a cured pepperoni flatbread and it wasn't very good at all.

Dandelion Market is one of those comfy, yet minimalist, bars that can certainly appeal to a variety of peeps. I'm a big fan of the exposed brick and duct work engulfing the restaurant. Upstairs, Dandelion Market provides a beautiful and expansive space for even more drinking, eating and general hanging out opportunities.   But let's get down to where they really shine - their beer offerings. While I'm not a beer gal, I was more than delighted with the Carolina Strawberry Ale, brewed just north of Charlotte in Mooresville. A hoppy mixture that twisted my taste buds with a strawberry effervescence. While it was probably \"chick beer\", I definitely appreciated the local love.   That's the great thing about Dandelion Market's beer selection - a fair amount of them are local. Hooray!   The service here was just great. Every bartender and server, on both the downstairs and upstairs levels, was just super friendly and laid back. It's the kind of place where you want everybody to know your name - and they definitely deliver.  I didn't get a chance to sample any eats here, but I look forward to coming back, grabbing a chick beer, listening to (another) great acoustic musician and relaxing in the market.",

Least favorite was the Stuffed Zucchini- not bad, just was ok!  Second round consisted of Pommes Frites, Mussels, Duck Confit flatbread, and Grilled Tiger Prawns. Not as good as our first round but the Mussels and Pommes Frites are AWESOME!! The Prawns were lacking flavor, again not bad but just ok. The Flatbread just didn't do it for me either.   We sat and drank a little but then moved on to the dessert my favorite was the Salted chocolate brownie (FABULOUS) and we had the bread pudding, it didn't stand a chance next to the brownie!!   It's a great space, decor is clean with subtle touches. The bar not huge but a nice cozy space with a tv and plenty of big comfy stools!  I can't wait to come back and try some other things this place is now going to be my new spot for when visitors come and just for EVERYDAY of the week!!",

I've been to places before that provided mediocre service because I had a coupon or deal.  This was not the case with Dandelion.  Our waitress (who's name I unfortunately can not remember) walked us through the menu, how the deal worked and provided suggestions on how to make the most of our evening.  The food was incredible and the wine, beer and cocktail menu was extensive.  It was a fantastic night out and I can't say enough about how great of a time we had.",

    "text": "So Ive been to Dandelion twice to eat and all in all had a fairly good experience (solid 3.5 stars)   The first was for Brunch where I had a yummy Bellini and the Torta Rustica. The Torta is HUGE and is certainly a sight to behold. The cold cuts were fresh and the bread was tasty and crusty. The star of the show was definitely the French Fries...wow they were good!   The second time I came for a late night appetizer and settled on the Calamari. Instead of the usual cocktail or marinara sauce they were served with a Lemon Garlic Aioli. At first I really enjoyed the Aioli but it did become too much so I had to ask for the Marinara. I did not enjoy the Marinara at all unfortunately. The Calamari were fairly small rings and were overly salted. I would not recommend these as a meal for one - it was a bit too much especially with the salt content.  I will say the atmosphere day or night is great ! The  prices are very reasonable as well ( $7 for calamari $8 for Torta).   Overall I plan on returning to try some other things",

The flowers & dim candle light make for an excellent casual date night.   The food. Oh my gosh! I & my boyfriend were in heaven. The Lamb Pops with the cherry sauce was like crack topped with sprinkles. (I've never smoked crack, but you get the point) Even something as simple as green beans is taken to a whole new delicious level at the DM. (It goes down in the DM ;) ) Our service was excellent! She really went above & beyond to make our evening special.I love when places leave the cute pitchers of water on the table, because we drink A TON of water.   It's within walking distance to the Knights Stadium. A suggestion to the fellas: Take your girl to a Knights game, afterwards treat her to casual yet amazing dinner at the Dandelion Market. You will be super glad you took my advice.",

We had a party of about 10 people and a few were running late. There was no wait, but since we couldn't be seated until our entire party arrived, I grabbed a quick soft drink at the bar. This was easily transferred over to my bill once seated.  We were sat upstairs at the long table that is normally hanging from the ceiling at night. I had the quiche of the day, which contained sausage and vegetables, and had fresh fruit on the side. In addition, I ordered a chocolate chip waffle. I thought that the wait for food was a little long, but maybe I was just hungry. Ha! All the food was good and I felt that it was a nice quantity for the price.  I've been to several brunch places in Charlotte and Dandelion is one of the better ones. When I come again I will probably get the Little Italy Omelette. One of my friends ordered it and it looked DELICIOUS.",

My coworker and I easily found the place as it was very distinctive from the outside. When we were seated, the atmosphere felt much like where people can come have a meal and some drinks. I wanted to try their tomato soup with grilled cheese but that was in their lunch menu. The place has separate menus for lunch and dinner.. Both worth a visit for.   The variety was wonderful and the portions are perfect for sharing multiple plates. We got the ribs (KC style), a crab cake and zucchini pasta. Loved the crab cake and ribs. The zucchini was okay. The other table had dessert that looked to be a delight. We, unfortunately, were too full to indulge.   They had a $15 dollar wine offer that night. Perfect for groups. I got a beer and coworker got a white wine that she said was delicious.   All in all, I loved the experience and the food. Service is amazing and food is up to par.   Will come back for the lunch if I come visit Charlotte again!",

Beer selection was standard and our waitress was attentive. We ordered four plates - the stuffed sausage poblano, the meatballs, the lamb lollipops and short rib on polenta. Everything was delicious but pretty salty. Our waitress was informative since it was our first time there and attentive. I'd go back again but would just request all the dishes be less salty. Seems to be much more happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Bartender waved goodbye even though we never met him. 2 thumbs up from me!",

I came here with my best friend Stefanie and our style is always to order a bunch of items and share them as well as a bottle of wine. They had half price bottles that night so it was an easy decision. We shared the mussels and I have to say they were probably the best mussels Ive had not at the beach. The other item I ordered were the crab cakes. Now I like to think of myself as a sort of crab cake connoisseur.  If a restaurant has them I will order them. This was to die for. I was not only impressed I have been talking to my guy about them since the night we went. I will be dragging him there very shortly and now that I'm talking about it it will probably be tomorrow.   The service was also amazing we sat at the bar uptstairs and our bartender was attentive knowledgable and friendly. The prices were more than fair and for the quality of food to be honest they could charge more.   Dandelion market is uptown so the parking situation can be just that a situation. Its totally worth whatever you have to go through to get there though. I honestly cannot wait to go back and would recommend this to anyone with tastebuds.",

She said it was her favorite wine and tapas spot in Charlotte. She said they had the best Brussel sprouts. So I decided to check it out the following night.  Though I was super hot outside, it was quite cool inside. The Pinot Noir I ordered warmed me up pretty quickly. The folks at the bar were quite friendly and so I engaged in some fun conversations with some like-minded business travelers.   Next I ordered the Brussel sprouts and prosciutto crostini. Though the crostini was fairly good, there was was too much sauce on it for my liking and messy to eat. I love prosciutto so I did finish it. The Brussel sprouts, on the other hand, were delicious and I could have eaten another bowl of it. If I were still hungry, I would have ordered the lamb lollipops. I guess I need to come back....",

I had heard that Charlotte had a great food scene, so we figured it was a good place to stop along the route.   We shared five small plates: arugula salad, prosciutto crostini, sweet and sour green beans, spicy potatoes, and black bean sliders. The arugula salad was large and refreshing after a few days of eating meals on the road. The potatoes were cooked wonderfully -- tender with delicious crispy bites -- but the spicy tomato sauce topping was a bit too hot for my taste. The green beans were my husband's choice; I'm not much of a green bean fan, but with the sweet sauce and macadamia nut topping, these were probably the best I've ever had. The crostini were my favorite item: creamy goat cheese and crispy prosciutto. We were underwhelmed by the lack of flavor in the black bean sliders at first, but they grew on us by the last bite.  But by far the best part of our Dandelion Market was the service. Our server was friendly and attentive, and when he found out we were on our honeymoon, he served us a free apple turnover and vanilla ice cream dessert, which was a phenomenal way to end the meal. We left the restaurant full and happy!",

Love the dim lighting and architecture. There's a downstairs bar and seating in addition to the upstairs bar - where we sat.   Service was probably the best I've ever had. The bartender, Katie, was GREAT. She was fun, personable, and we loved chatting with her.   Drinks were made perfectly. The menu items we shared were great. Sliders and mussels. There were so many other items I wanted to try but we weren't too hungry so just got those. They were delicious though! The prices were very reasonable and the menu is incredibly extensive, which is great.   I'll be back without a doubt!",

The table layout is easy to get around and the bars are large and inviting.  Service has been consistent each time I have dined. Friendly, attentive, and timely.   Drinks are creative and delicious, reasonably priced. Cocktails, wine, and beer all have a variety of selection for anyone to find something. A list of $25 bottles of wine is also great.   Food menu doesn't change much but the selection has a wide variety and maintains quality. Some dishes seem to have gone up in price over the years, but all still very reasonable cost for value. I recommend the mac and cheese, lamb lollipops, and spinach dip.   No question about this being a repeat restaurant choice.",

It's not that the flavor is subtle.  There is no flavor.  No herbs, spices or zest.  Like low-sodium hospital food.  The steak skewers have a sauce that has good flavor.  They said they recommend medium rare.  I prefer medium the first time I try beef at new restaurant.  But they came out rare anyway.  They tasted marinated, which to me kills the point of ordering rare meat.    The bizarre part of the experience was the seating.  Upstairs along the far wall is a row of tables and chairs on one side and vinyl bench style seating on the other.  But the bench is almost a foot higher than the chairs.  So you're looking up at people like a Hobbit.  Ask for a booth.  The best thing about it was the french fries.  It was the last thing we ordered.  Finally some salt and seasoning.  And the drinks.  So fries and drinks!",

Food was awesome.  Prices are reasonable too for portion sizes. I REALLY like that you can order one of everything for $295.  We started off with deviled eggs, chicken wings and the crostini's.  Everything was on point and we ordered more food. For round two we got the lamb lollis, croquets, and finished with salted caramel brownie. Awesome, we were stuffed when we left.

Yeah, I think it was Cory. Anyways, I had Meatballs Marinara and Grilled Asparagus. The meatballs were pretty basic and the asparagus was nice because it had an egg and kimchi. It could have been a meal for me all by itself. To drink, I had a Narragansett's Del's Lemon Shandy. It was pretty good! I also had a Wicked Weed Rotating Sour.

Most people know them for their late night weekends, however, I always encourage people to go for dinner or for weekend brunch. Their menu is all small plates and all of the ones I've had are excellent. My favorites include the steak skewers, the tomato salad and the baked potato croquettes. With a large selection of small plates and a romantic ambiance, Dandelion is an excellent date spot! They also can easily accommodate large parties as long as they are given adequate notice.   The review is four stars because parking can be a challenge and I miss the Southern Caprese Salad, my all-time favorite from Dandelion.",

    "text": "I was visiting Charlotte on business and needed to grab dinner somewhere near my hotel. After wandering up and down the street, I finally decided to step into Dandelion Market, which my local coworker recommended to me. Despite its name, Dandelion is a bar that serves tapas and feels very much like a bar rather than a restaurant. At just before 8 pm on a Tuesday evening, there was plentiful seating downstairs and upstairs and no wait for me. I was attended to frequently throughout my visit and appreciated the service! 2-3 small dishes per person are recommended.   I ordered the pan seared scallops ($17) and mac and cheese ($8). The scallops are on a bed of collard greens and something else (I wasn't able to identify it by taste or in the dim atmosphere of the bar) and sauce. The sauce was a bit on the salty side for me, but it was still tasty.   The mac and cheese was very cheesy and tasty; I'd say it would place #2 or #3 on the list of \"fancy\" mac and cheese dishes I've had. Not the most amazing but definitely savory!",

    "text": "Had some friends in town staying at The Dunhill Hotel uptown, they had already been to Harvest Moon Grille the night before, which was a bummer because I really want to try that place out. After some catching up and a couple of drinks from the hotel bar we all decided to walk around the block and give Dandelion Market a go.  My wife and I have been here before so we knew more or less what to expect.  For anyone who happens to still be reading....this place is a tapas style place with an abundance of selections to fit any picky eater's desires.  There were six of us and while we waited for a table to open up I wanted to show off the upstairs area which I think is a very cool spot with high ceilings, exposed brick, a nice bar, cozy seating selections and an interesting contraption hanging in the middle of the room that is used to raise and lower a huge dining table.  They have a great selection of local brews on tap. After a drink we headed back downstairs to our table. We ordered ALL of the following items: trio of spreads, southern caprese salad, flat bread, home made chips, buttered sauteed sea scallops, pan seared ahi tuna, crab cakes, dando ribs and grilled flat iron oscar. Carrot cake and peanut butter chocolate cake rounded out the feast.  A few things really stood out for me. The pimento cheese spread that came with the trio of spreads was fantastic. The home made chips were hot and absolutely delicious coupled with a brew. The grilled flat iron oscar was just mouth-watering good, nice rare steak covered with asparagus cream sauce.  Everyone in our party left a bit tipsy (thanks to the high alcohol content of the local brews) left with with a full stomach and left with a smile on our faces.   An all around great experience. I would definitely recommend Dandelion Market, for the atmosphere, the great selection of brews on tap, great menu and good, friendly service.",

    "text": "Went here with a girlfriend for dinner. Being from out of town, I had called ahead of time to see about making reservations for a Saturday night at 7:30. I was told they only made reservations for large parties but that I should have no problem getting in at that time. So when I was told upon arriving that it would be an hour wait, I was a little disappointed. The hostess was very unapologetic about it and in fact, seemed like she was having a bad night. We tried to wait around the bar area but we really felt like we were in the way. Also felt like we were the oldest people in the place- we are in our early 50's. This is definitely a younger crowd place. It was so noisy- one girl was so loud, you literally could not hear anyone else. One of the hostesses came to get us and told us our table was ready. As she began to seat us, at a table for 6- with 6 menus- I realized she might be confused. Sure enough, she apologized and told us this was not our table. We had to stand around some more. When the party of 6 did not show up, the pulled the table apart and seated us again. When my friend tried to thank the hostess, she said rudely, \"I need your beeper\"- which I had already given to the other hostess.  But the food saved the day! We tried the shrimp bruschetta- it was the best dish of the night. Aldo had the trio of hummus, red pepper spread and delicious pimento cheese with warm pita bread. The crab and avocado salad was good but needed a little more seasoning. We also had the gnocchi with winter vegetables and the black bean burger. The gnocchi were cut a little too large for my liking and didn't care for the black bean burger. It was heavy and dry. Not sure I would go back for just a party of two. the food was great but the hostess should be ashamed of herself. You are in customer service, girl. Shame on you.",

We ordered a variety of tapas:  spinach & goat cheese salad (good, but one small sliver of goat cheese?), calamari (it was just OK), ribs (very good), brussel sprouts (really good), shrimp and grits (very good) and the beef sliders (excellent).  I would put the sprouts and sliders at the top of the list.  Ordered a bottle of cabernet.  I realize I shouldn't complain, as all their bottles are only $25, but the wine was just OK...I think it was called The Show & we found it to be a bit on the sweet side.  For dessert we split a brownie w/caramel & ice cream, which was decent, but I wouldn't run back for it.  Would def. try a different dessert in the future.  Overall, a really nice experience in a pretty cool atmosphere.",

I really liked the calamari, and my wife loved the fried mushrooms.  The chimichurri was okay, but it had cilantro, which I hate.  But it's okay if you dont' mind.  Service was slow.  The host tried to provide service but failed, and we didn't get a waitress until we were almost done. I will cut them a break because they had three large parties that evening, but it strikes me given their location, the staff should have been prepared.  However, my main pet peeve is they served the first few tapas one plate at a time, which defeats the purpose of tapas which is to share them.",

    "text": "Listen, I love exposed brick and bars with lots of atmosphere.  Dandelion Market has all that, with a rack of shoes on one wall, an elevated seating area, and of course this mythical upstairs area that we didn't get to see since it was 6 pm on a week night.  Folks at the bar were drinking and having a great time; our party of three grabbed a table to order some of their small plates and see what all the fuss was about.  The beer list is very good, but - as my husband said - \"there's nothing on here I've never tried before,\" and I felt the whole list was a tick expensive.  I'll be back on a Monday night for their $3 drafts.  As for the food, it was disappointing.  I always feel tapas places are overpriced, particularly for vegetarians, and I came away with the same feeling from Dandelion Market.  My husband and I ordered a pesto flatbread, pommes frites, and the \"deconstructed\" caprese.  The flatbread was completely unmemorable, and the most interesting part of the caprese were the balls of fried mozzarella.  Though the baby greens were limp and boring, a bite of fried mozzy, tomato, and greens was pretty all right.  The pommes frites were disappointing... when I order a $6 plate of pommes frites, I guess I expect more pommes and less frites.  When I surveyed our spread, I had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I'd just spent $12 on a tiny, average salad and a plate of fries.  Our friend had the mussels, which were much more impressive looking, and I imagine the other meat dishes comported themselves equally well.  Sometimes it sucks to be veg.  Dessert was a salted brownie with caramel drizzle - another completely unmemorable concoction - though our friend ordered the rhubarb crumble, which was the best thing I think all of us tasted the entire evening.  I'll give Dandelion a 3-star for atmo and beer list, but I doubt I'll be eating here again.",

Nothing pleases me more than tasting some of this and some of that.  The other part of the reason is that my dining philosophy is generally if you can make it at home with no unreasonable effort, you should just make it at home.  Now try making a tapas menu at home.  It'll take forever and it probably won't be very good.  So for me tapas/small plates = the perfect restaurant dining experience. I thoroughly enjoyed dinner at \"dando\".  Little plates of calimari, mac and cheese, ribs and a couple of other things were very tasty.  The marinated olives were a bit on the salty side.  The beer selection was of course very satisfying as well, I got a delightful, fragrant Belgian. We went back for brunch one day and honestly that was less impressive.  The fluffy fritatta was tasty, the waffle was just ok.  The coffee was not piping hot. I'd definitely come back for dinner, but it looks like my brunch search is still on.",

    "text": "I wish I could write two reviews for Dandelion Market-one for the upstairs and one for the downstairs because it was two completely different vibes.  I absolutely loved the downstairs area and wish I could have stayed there all night. Open seats at the bar on a Saturday night along with a friendly bartender with some football playing is all I really need in life. It had a chill vibe, exposed brick walls and  music playing just loud enough to enjoy but you could hear another speak and just seemed like a cozy atmosphere. One of my friends I was with is pregnant and the bartender Amanda whipped up a special alcohol free concoction for her. Can I please just stay downstairs forever enjoying my Shocktop?  The answer-no. We had a large party and wanted to sit down to eat and our table was upstairs  I really wanted to love this place but the upstairs kinda killed it for me. I didn't even know there was an upstairs area but when we got there, I wanted to go into the corner and crawl into a fetal position. It was like every 25 yr old hipster in town was there and every guy seemed to have either a vintage blazer and John Edwards hair (or sometimes both--eek!)  It wasn't a place to eat, it was a bar area! They had  large booths and I was sitting on the outside and kept getting elbowed by some randoms doing shots. Server was nice but they seemed to be out of alot of stuff by 9P. I got the flatbread and house salad which were both ok but nothing to write home about. The flatbread seemed more like a mini pizza than flatbread and the salad had about seven to eight pieces of lettuce with some cranberries and dressing. I could find a better salad elsewhere for $6. I just wanted to finish my meal so I could get the hell back downstairs.   I'll probably check out Dandelion again for lunch during the week or an after work drink but no way will I be venturing into hipster hell upstairs again!",

So as far as food goes, there was 3 of us in our group. We were there for dinner and ordered a bottle of wine (all the bottles are $25!). We started with the cheese plate, the antipasto plate and the roasted red pepper and artichoke dip. We all agreed that the dip was really tasty and left none in the bowl. The cheese plate offered 3 different cheeses, nothing extraordinary but not bad. The antipasto had salami, prosciutto, sausage and pepperoni. Here again, nothing extraordinary but definitely tasty.  Next course we ordered the chicken roulade, ahi tuna, steak skewers and ribs. The ribs were fall off the bone, really good! The ahi tuna was my next favorite. The steak was a bit tough but had a good flavor. And finally the chicken roulade was just a bit overcooked (but anything with goat cheese in it is good to me).  We finished with a cheese fondue (sounds silly now, but we also were on our second bottle of wine).  All in all we enjoyed ourselves and ate all of the food. The end price was actually pretty good for all we got. We'll definitely be going there again.",

    "text": "I had a dozen girlfriends in town and we decided to go to Dandelion Market for dinner. We were seated upstairs, and the atmosphere was nice- sort of dark, not fancy or anything, but just nice enough.   Since there were so many of us, we decided to order the menu item that includes every single tapas plate on the menu. I honestly think everyone should find a dozen of their closest friends and do exactly this, so that you get to taste everything on the menu instead of having to choose!  The food was absolutely amazing. When the plates started coming out, all of us were getting basically a bite of each plate. And we're looking at each other and thinking \"uh-oh. This is never going to work\". But then some of the plates are coming out where you're getting 2-4 bites. And then, 25 plates later, you're absolutely stuffed with truly fantastic food. The lamb lollipops were amazing, as were the scallops, flatbread pizzas, the cheese board, the mussels (a LOT of mussels!), the steak. I had ZERO complains about the food.  The service was good. I wish there had been a better way of staging the items, because it started off with a slow trickle, and then at one point we were just slammed with plates- there was no way to keep up with them!   I guess the wine list and beer list is good. I don't know. Someone else ordered all of our wine, and I don't get really picky when it comes to fermented grapes.  I would recommend Dandelion to anyone. Personally, I'd have a hard time coming back and only getting to choose a few plates. For around $25 per person (plus booze, of course), I thought the \"try everything\" option couldn't have been better. Will absolutely be coming back, as soon as I wrangle up 10 friends to go with me.",

I can tell you Dandelion Market certainly lived up to all my expectations from the service and cozy atmosphere to the delicous menu. I love the small, \"tapas\" style entrees.    You can order several selections, share with friends (my group all ordered different selections and passed them around.) I always enjoy eating small portions and feeing satisfied, not over fed.  I already had the procuitto crostini in mind.  Boy was it delicious, salty and sweet and creamy, too.  Our server stayed attentive to our table, was very helpful explaining the menu and kept the drinks coming.  I really like the carafes of water on the table, so that your water glass in never empty and you don't have to keep asking your server for more.  Great idea!    I also recommend the steak skewers and the spicy prawns and flatbreads.  The guiness  (sp) brownie is delicous.  Great beer selection too.     I loved the exposed brick interior and over stuffed chairs tucked in one nook,  great for having drinks and conversation.   All in all a great night and I hope to return again soon.",

But trust me try this place I'm sure all the servers are capable and nice, but if you want to assure great service ask for Julie she is great...We had scallops, lamb, Gnocchi and Bruschetta.

I really love the bartenders, and the environment.  The bartenders remember me whether I've been there a few times within one week or if I haven't been there in over 3 weeks.  The atmosphere is also nice because it offers a dichotomas separation between party dance thumping (upstairs) and a busy pub atmosphere downstairs.  I've also tried some of their food before and was pleasently surprised.  My only reason for not giving Dandelion Market 5 stars is because the upstairs section on weekend is not equipt to handle the amount of people coming in.  It has been increasingly difficult to get a drink, or to even have a decent amount of room to dance.  After 11 on a Friday and Saturday leads to something I call the Sardine Effect.  I'm sure you can figure that one out.    I've had many good times here but you just have to pick and choose the nights you come or be prepared for a more crowded scene (on the weekends)!",

Apparently they no longer go here often anymore because of how overcrowded it is now.  They are now charging a $5 cover for guys - which covers exactly nothing because there is no live music.  Rather than switch to \"one in, one out\" the owner just lets in as many people that show up.  It was literally impossible to move upstairs and not much better downstairs.  Good luck getting a drink.  I can't speak to the staff but had a brief interaction with the owner and he was one of the rudest people I have ever met.  Talking down to people and acting like it was a gift to be allowed in the bar.  Charlotte has too many good places to visit to waste time/money here.",

I usually stay away from the upstairs, especially on weekends, as it does tend to get crowded and douche-y. (And really guys, $3 craft pints and you just got a Miller Lite? Really?)

    "text": "I live right down the road from Dandelion Market and I really enjoy it. I know a couple great people who work there as well and I've never had a problem with the service, even on the crazy busier nights.   Dandelion is a great place for a dinner date before hitting the town or with a group of friends for a dinner celebration or just drinks! They get very busy on the weekend nights, though! This place magically turns into almost a club scene with loud music within no time after the dinner crowd starts to retreat. If you would like to check Dandelion Market out, I would suggest you go on a weekend night for a tapas dinner (which is delicious) and then stay a little while after for drinks so you can witness the \"Raising of the Table\" upstairs. The first time I saw it I was impressed by the grandeur of the display. There is a huge, heavy wooden table that is literally raised from the floor to the ceiling after the last party finished from it and right before they put on the music to get the party going! I don't think they have a specific time that they do this but if you ask to eat upstairs, you will eventually see it if you stay long enough afterwards. As soon as that table is raised all the way to the ceiling, it's dancing time!! Yeahhh.  As far as the food goes, it does seem a little pricey for tapas,  but what do you expect from the uptown area? Everything I have ordered there has been delicious such as Lamb lollipops, Potato croquettes, Mac and cheese and much more. Try a little bit of everything and you won't be disapopinted. They also serve breakfast and even though I've only been once, I would definitely go again and recommend it for a non-traditional weekend brunch.   Dandelion also has a great draft beer and wine selection. Their bartenders seem pretty knowledgeable in what they serve so don't hesitate to ask if you are overwhelmed by the choices.  Overall, I enjoy Dandelion Market and find the staff to be super friendly and welcoming. Good eats and a really good time too!",

We found Dandelion Market on 360Charlotte.Their food was amazing, the atmosphere was quaint and cozy yet lively and fun and we can't wait to bring more friends and come again. Don't go without ordering The Lamb Lollypops (and being Greek I am very picky about my lamb) and the Ahi Tuna. By far the best on the menu but still so many good choices. The wine selection was great and for $25 a bottle how can you go wrong? After dinner, go upstairs for some DJ fun as they raise the table and the dancing begins. We and our friends ventured out from the 'burbs and we are so glad we did. Can't wait to go again!!",

    "text": "I think I'm becoming a small plates addict.  Had dinner at yet ANOTHER tapas like restaurant, this time in Charlotte, and left pleased once again.  I think the world REALLY needs more small plates venues, it would make for smilier, happier people, seriously!  At Dandelion Market, the atmosphere is pub like with dim lighting, a big screen tv, and a rustic feel.  It screams, come in, have a drink & some hearty food, and relax.  We got a table right by the window and midway through our dinner it started to downpour, with strong bouts of lightening.  With candles on every table, exposed brick, the rain beating hard by the window, and just the all around coziness of the place, we couldn't have picked a better spot to be at.  As for the food, really loved just about everything we ordered.  The mac and cheese was a pleasant surprise made with corkscrew noodles instead of the standard bent noodles and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The bread crumbs on the top melted nicely throughout the dish.  Our santa fe corn plate was a mouthful of zesty flavor with just the right amount of tangy kick.  My favorite though was hands down the roasted red pepper and artichoke dip, so creamy and yummy, and incredibly perfect with the warm soft yet slightly crispy pita slices.  Due to the downpour, we decided to stick around in the restaurant a bit longer and with nothing else to do, we ordered dessert (yeah, it was a tough call!) and I have to say their bread pudding totally rocked.  It was slightly different than most bread puddings I've had which are generally soft, gooey, and blended with carmel, but at Dandelion, it was more like soft sweetened toast with ice cream, which doesn't sound very good, but actually tasted pretty amazing.  Their menu is vegetarian friendly (all three of us who went are veggies) and their prices are super reasonable too.  We ordered a tea, four small plates and two desserts and our bill came out to under $45!  Pretty sweet deal :)  If you're in the neighborhood, this place is definitely worth giving a try!",

    "text": "The website makes this place appear a lot larger than it actually is - at least on the first floor. My friend called and asked if we needed reservations she was told no but when we got there we had about a 10 min wait for a table . I'm learning to just make reservations whenever I go out to any semi popular restaurant in Charlotte even the chain restaurants. We were seated near the bar and brought water and shot glasses ... like seriously I guess the water \"glasses\" go with the ambiance but they were literally the size of a large shot glass... Since  I would have looked like an idiot putting a straw into a shot glass I decided on a glass of white wine...  I prefer to drink my nonalcoholic beverages with a straw .. alcohol kills germs right .... I'm a huge fan of tapas or small plates because I get to sample pretty much everything, I'm not into the whole sharing thing so I ordered 3 small plates for myself.  I tried the spinach and goat cheese salad .. wow this was pretty good so simple yet so good. They gave a generous amount of spinach with pine nuts, and a scoop of goat cheese on top. Next I had the grilled lamb lollipops so yummy they were also covered in the same vinaigrette as my salad , and finally the sliders  - basically a cheese burger with some fancy bacon . Both the chops and sliders only had two servings so unless it's just two people I would either order two or get something else if you're planning on sharing with a group.  Overall the food was pretty good my friends tried the calamari, and the shrimp and grits ... and whoa who knew that you could fry grits  into the shape of little cubes.. They had an interesting taste but a strange presentation at least to me. I'm not a big fan of shrimp and grits but my friend said they were delicious (only two shrimps tho...)  I'm not sure what's upstairs I'm hoping more tables b/c there isn't a lot of room downstairs and it's super dark in there. I like this place and would be interested in coming back from brunch .   Parking - I parked in the deck over on 6th street I think there is another deck down 5th maybe .. but the walk from the 6th street deck (5 bucks) wasn't bad.",

They have a large number of beers on tap and a menu of interesting/innovative takes on pub grub, priced reasonably and served as small plates.  For example, between my wife and me, we had an artisan cheese plate, bacon cheddar sliders, fried calamari and some spicy raw tuna on top of crispy flatbread-like chips as well as two beers each.  Basically this let us try a bunch of awesome stuff without getting too full or breaking the bank.  Everything they served us was good; the star in my opinion was the tuna.  I appreciated the bartender's recommendations for beer, as well - I told him I was in the mood for a lager and wanted to try something new, and he had me taste his recommendation before he served up a full one.  Nice gesture.",

I had the same bartender each of the three times I went, and he remembered what I and each member of my party had ordered the previous time.  I was totally comfortable telling the bartender to \"give me something great,\" and trust he'd pull a good beer for me.  He did not disappoint.  As other yelpers have said, there are two floors, with the upstairs having a hidden DJ loft, and a large table which lifts to the ceiling on weekends to create a dance floor.  To be honest, I much preferred the earlier part of the week, where quiet blues was playing and some baseball was on the TV, to the later, louder week with the Lady Gaga and the shiny-shirted ladies and gelled gents, but that's just my scene.  The beer, the staff, and the service were great.",

Over priced and undersized portions. Dandelion Market was the antithesis of that thinking. I started with the Red Pepper Artichoke Dip, it was delicious and the crispy pitas were a perfect pairing. The Shrimp and Grits were flavorful with a nice presentation using fried squares of grits and beautifully prepared shrimp, but I should have opted for the larger portion because it was just that good! I also tried the Lamb Lollipops at the recommendation of a friend. They were cooked to perfection and the addition of cherry to the flavor was delightful. I just hope other diners weren't off-put by my cleaning of the wonderful crisp lamb bones.  When the bill came I was astonished, all this food for around $25. This place will definitely be on my list. I need to bring others with me so we can try a wider array of their small plates.",

Place looks like it's been there forever. . .really like the table layout and the big common picnic table in the middle of the first floor.  Food: as others have stated, this is a pseudo-tapas place, but with a Gaelic twist. There are the usual standards (calamari, wings, beer fondue) and some really interesting unusual items (duck flatbread pizza, fried oysters, fried sage leaves). Everything we tried was very good, portions were generous. In particular the crostini and sage leaves were excellent, the lamb lollypops were also very good but you need to like your lamb rare.  Drinks: Very cool, local, unusual beer selection. A plethora of wine selections under $25 per bottle, which is nice.  Service: Prompt, polite, and easy. Who could ask for more?  Overall this place is a welcome addition to Uptown and I will visit again!",

Should have done that as we spent a bit over $300, and that is just for five people.  The layout is great.  downstairs with some tables and a small bar, then upstairs with the big bar and a few more private tables.  A HUGE picnic table in the center (should fit like 20!).

    "text": "Visited Dandelion Market with friends on Saturday 11/14/15.  Have visited this location before and had loved it.  We were having a wonderful experience till the food stopped coming out.  We had several appetizers come out no problem.  Our sides showed up and then for 30 minutes no food.  Why order sides if you don't have real food to enjoy them with, so we asked to see the manager.  She had such a chip on her shoulder and told us this is the way their restaurant runs.  She blamed the server for not explaining properly how things work and was very defensive and said she would check on things.  We finally received a steak skewer and then 20 minutes later 2 shrimp but when you have four people at the table, we are hungry.  The manager came back and again repeated her excuse for the delay in food and while we were talking with her the remaining 2 dishes came out.  This manager has very poor communication skills blaming the customer and the server.  I hope they find a new manager.",

    "text": "When I lived uptown, this place was always first on my list. For drinks, for pre-nights out meals, for a quick lunch... and if I had written this when I still lived uptown, it would be a five star review and then some.  A few weeks ago I found myself uptown on a weeknight and was need of a post-show meal. Obviously, the first place that popped into my head was Dandelion Market. They had changed the menu a bit since the last time I was there but some of the staples were right where I'd left them. We ordered the cheese plate, the mussels, and the pommes frites. You can't go wrong with mussels, bacon, and cream - so this dish is highly recommended. The fries were delicious, were a huge portion, and the homemade ketchup was great too. I really liked the cheeses offered, but that's where that fifth star started to fade. 1) If your menu doesn't specify the cheeses coming to the table, either the food runner or the server should tell you what's on it... or just be available to answer questions when you can't figure it out yourself. 2) the only bread offered should not be partially grilled pita, it doesn't hold up to anything (with a different selection of cheeses I might have understood, but not with what we received)... I ended up stealing the toasted bread from the mussels to eat some of the cheese.   It also took a really long time to get our round of drinks, and the place was not busy. plus, when we finally did get our drinks I was informed it was the last of the brand of liquor I had requested... bummer.  But the last missteps aside, I still love dandelion market. Their menu has a great variety of dishes and who doesn't love sampling a ton of delicious small plates? I don't think I've ever had a \"bad\" dish from DM, and I don't see them disappointing me in the future. (especially with their excellent beer selection).",

Finishing the review a couple days on. Still have positive things to say. Enjoyed the food, the bartender was great. Small-ish and dark, but in a good way. Felt comfortable.

    "text": "I haven't written a review in quit sometime.  Truthfully nothing has blown my socks off to spend the time to write one...that was until I went to Dandelion Market.  Let me first start off with- Im an extremely picky eater, and not willing to try new things most of the time.  In addition to my pickiness, I'm not much for tapas, no reason, just part of my weirdness.  I was extremely and pleasantly surprised by this place.   We had a work dinner (about 15 people), and we went to Dandelion Market.  Upstairs had plenty of room to host a large group gathering down to an intimate couples dinner.  While downstairs has a great bar and plenty of room for a happy hour.  I don't think there was much on the menu that we DIDN'T order.  Personal Favorites were: BAKED POTATO CROQUETTES, FRIED PICKLES, SLIDERS, GRILLED STEAK SKEWERS (personally ordered 3 of these), BBQ SHORT RIB, SWEET & SPICY GREEN BEANS.  I'm not a big brussel sprouts fan, but the table ordered 4 servings of them...they apparently are amazing.    Serving sizes are perfect, for 2-4 people, if you have anymore, make sure you order multiple orders.  If you have a large group, you can order the entire market menu for $275.  I enjoyed the food here so much, we went back 2 weeks later.",

And the drinks are not that crafty or tasty.   I'm usually never one to complain about service, but our server literally mocked one of my best friends and it was extremely rude. Especially for it to be the day after Christmas.   Besides that, my visits here have been extraordinary from food, to drinks and the ambiance.",

We were promptly seated: the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded after all it was Tuesday after Christmas.  It would have helped us choose if their online menu and website had indicated that they were a small plates joint and therefore the prices were expensive for the small portions. In disclosure the waitress did tell us it was small plates after she seated us.   Short ribs, mac&cheese, a few different salads, lamb lollipops--it was excellent food all around.  The problem was the poor service.  Having to ask for a replacement napkin several times before it rang a bell. And dessert. It took at least 15 minutes for the waitress to return and apologize that there was no tiramisu then another fifteen before the single dessert appeared.  Lots of waiting and feeling ignored tonight with nobody visible to flag down. Good food is a large part of the experience but lousy service can wreck it.",

With that said, this is by far our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. American style small plates and literally everything on the menu is delicious. Cherry. Glazed. Lamb. Lollipops. Write that down. Also the sweet potato gnocchi is always a huge hit when we bring people there and we end up getting 2-3 orders of it. This place is quaint enough for a date night with just your significant other, but even better when you go with groups that are larger. You can try more things that way.   There is also a bartender here, I forget his name. I've only seen him at the downstairs bar, and he's Irish, but he makes the best Old Fashioned in Charlotte. Well, besides me!",

We were seated upstairs in a booth across from the bar, near the bathrooms. Our waiter was nice, and when we told him we were from out of town he gave us recommendations for what to try both there and around the city (little did we know at that time that throughout the rest of the vacation, everyone else we talked to would recommend Dandelion Market!!!). The beer list was creative with \"Tourists on Tap\" and \"Rotating Locals.\" We each ordered a beer as well as prosciutto crostinis, a mozzarella & pesto flatbread, and chorizo fundido. Everything came out beautifully. The flatbread was crispy, but not burnt. We actually enjoyed dipping the flatbread into the fundido! The fundido didn't have enough of those brown, crunchy chips, so it worked out perfect with the flatbread. I loved the bits of picked onion and chorizo mixed into the creamy queso. The crostinis were topped with prosciutto, goat cheese, fig preserves, caramelized onions, and a balsamic glaze. You really can't go wrong with prosciutto, but Dandelion Market definitely went above and beyond with this flavor combo! It was salty, with a slight sweetness from the preserves. It was crispy, but soft because of the goat cheese! Very enjoyable and highly recommend. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!!!",

We ordered 2 omelettes, French toast sticks and a hangover hash. Everything was good but definitely not worth a 55 minute wait!",

    "text": "I came for dinner with a group of friends and managed to order 10 dishes split between four people.  Suffice it to say, that's probably more than normal quartets would order, but I was in the group and I love to eat! :)  We ordered the Baked Potato Croquettes, Prosciutto Crostini, Grilled Lamb Lollipops, Dando Ribs, Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Sauteed Wild Mushrooms, Market Mac & Cheese, Sweet & Spicy Green Beans, Butter Sauteed Sea Scallops, and the Dando Crab Cakes.  Overall, the dishes were pretty great, but there were a couple of I'm-definitely-getting-these-next-time plates that are worth a special mention.  The Prosciutto Crostini, Dando Ribs, and Sweet & Spicy Green Beans are must-haves. The Baked Potato Croquettes were tasty, but don't have the same punch to the taste buds as the other three I mentioned. The Sauteed Wild Mushrooms were great, but very, very salty/creamy/rich and are best evenly shared between multiple people so you don't get too overwhelmed by the strength of the sauce.  I had high hopes for the Grilled Lamb Lollipops and the Butter Sauteed Sea Scallops, but found them to be very forgettable.  I'm not a fan of sausage, but had a taste of the pepper shell of the Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper and it definitely had a spicy kick that was nice.",

    "text": "Okay, to be totally fair, I would give this place another half star if Yelp let me. Also, I've been to as many gastropubs in California as my waistline will allow, so I don't mean to discourage the fledgling gastropub scene here in Charlotte. But, I can't help but compare.  The good:  The bartenders on the first floor are always *phenomenal* and the mixed cocktails they serve are innovative and well-crafted. Absolutely try the fig cocktail, which is a great unisex drink: fairly sweet for the girls, but full-bodied and not overly sugary for the guys.   Atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Some of the plates are out of this world: standard pub fare like chicken wings have that extra zip from whatever seasoning they use. Also, you MUST try the ribs and the sausage-stuffed pepper. Foodie heaven. Lamb lollipops are also wonderful.  The bad:  The food is not as well-thought-out as it should be, considering this place's fame and what they're trying to accomplish. The bruschetta is only toasted on one side, making it soft on the top of your tongue, but hard and crunchy on the top of your palette. The black bean sliders should be delicious, but the rather bready and unremarkable buns they serve them on are very distracting to the taste buds.  Full service is slow and the servers are not very knowledgeable about the food that's being ordered. I know that good help can be hard to find, but Dandelion Market needs to step up the game with its waitstaff if it wants to have the best gastropub in town. Also, having to wait a long time for your food is silly in a place like this. You have one of the most popular joints in town, put more people in the kitchen!",

The food is fab!   My favorite thing there is the tomato soup and grilled cheese. I know, it sounds simple, but it's hard to do simple right. The grilled cheese is on thick bread, buttery and cheesy and yummy. The soup is perfection, hearty, tangy and rich. On a cold rainy day, there's nothing better.  The salads are great. Big, filling and the dressings all taste homemade. If you are looking for something different, the black bean sliders have just the right amount of spice to make you crave them.   The service can be spotty, but that seems to be a trend in uptown. Go, try Dandelion!",

The atmosphere is cool and laid back.  I also noticed the nice Bloody Mary bar which was conveniently located right in the middle of the restaurant.  While I did not partake, I most certainly would recommend it for anyone who enjoys Bloody Marys.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive, making sure our coffee and water never ran out.  I ordered the veggie benedict which was really excellent.  My dad ordered sausage, eggs, and grits.  The grits were really good and made just the way I like them.  The sausage was in large links rather than patties which was a bit unexpected.  My father did not particularly like the sausage.  I tried it and it was indeed a bit different, but I enjoyed it.  This is really a great place and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it for myself.  All in all really good experience and I look forward to coming back!",

Wished we came by for dinner instead, since the lunch menu was a \"meh\" to me.   Service - The waiter was nice and attentive.  We were able to get seated right away, since we came early - 12:30am, on a Friday - yay us!  Price - It was somewhat pricey, but managable.    Future - I will definitely be back for dinner and try out their scallops.",

Spinach & Goat cheese salad.....needed some greens in our diet, but tasty Surf & Turf...scallops and pulled pork were both very flavorful, great dish Salmon cakes.....another tasty dish Crab cakes....I thought these were better than the salmon cakes, great flavor Sliders....sliders with bacon? enough said, delicious Ribs....wet ribs with a nice amount of meat on each, solid dish Stuffed Poblano Pepper...might have been my favorite dish of the night and very filling Mac & Cheese...very creamy and you get that hint of smoked pepper  I am drawing a blank of the last few, but I think we doubled up on 1 or 2 of the ones I mentioned.

They also have a great beer selection - found a new favorite, in fact. If you like Allagash, try their Witterkirke - I've never seen it on a menu before and I'm heading to Total Wine to look for some for my fridge!   We were upstairs, which was getting crowded with after work peeps, by the time we left (9ish) it was packed! Our server was very attentive to our large group and the food came out really fast!

It reminded me of a pub with exposed brick walls, dark wood floors and Palladian windows.    Our waitress was Jasmine and she was very friendly with a sunny disposition.  One of my pet peeves is when I go to a restaurant, order coffee and the server never comes back to refill it.  Jasmine was attentive and brought us more coffee whenever she saw we were running low.  She also didn't rush us out of the restaurant when we were done eating, which was nice as it was the last stop we made before heading home. At the end of the meal she asked us if we had ever come to Dandelion Market for dinner. When we told her we hadn't she told us about what type of food is served and how great it was. She seemed so genuine that it makes me want to come back and try it.  Overall the food was good. They made slight changes to old favorites, which makes breakfast more interesting. The french toast sticks were a little overcooked and the hollandaise sauce on the crab cake benny was a little too lemony but overall we were happy.",

Our waitress was nice, but our food took forever to come out and the restaurant was not packed.  Even still, they brought me the wrong omelet.  My wife's omelet was cold in some spots, and for $11 you should use real crab.  She is a native soiutherner and knows here grits, and said these were terrible.  The highlight was the home fries.  I like those but maybe because I was hungover.  I am glad we only paid $10 for this meal, because it wasn't worth much more than that.

The first time was with some friends who were also attending the wedding--one couple had actually been there the day before and raved about it. I had the Monte Cristo and had to restrain myself from inhaling the whole thing in 5 minutes: it was crispy, soft, sweet, salty--everything you could want in a brunch sandwich. And if that isn't enough, it comes with raspberry preserves AND maple syrup (and you'll want to test both out, believe me). From what I heard, everyone else enjoyed their meals as well.  The next day, I met my mom, aunt, grandmother, and my mom's best friend in Charlotte and I guess my description of The Dandelion Market was so tantalizing that they wanted to try it as well. Everyone at the table got the Monte Cristo except for me; I opted for a set of small plates: a Cinnamon Roll, Scrambled Eggs, and Bacon (had to try something new!). Everyone loved the Monte Cristo (which made me happy).  The service was pretty good; it was a bit slow at times, but overall, the staff was courteous. The space was very open, giving me the sense that the restaurant is pretty active bar venue, but the lighting was very dark, especially for a morning spot. Nonetheless, I'll be sure to stop by The Dandelion Market the next time I'm in downtown Charlotte!",

The brussel sprouts were undercooked and under seasoned (coming from someone who uses very little salt).

I admit it: I was intrigued by the menu description; but was let down like prom night. Scallops (like the brussel sprouts) were undercooked (and I eat sushi so don't even think I'm not not fond of raw fish).  The pork was the highlight I guess, but it was literally 4 fork-fulls.   The service was fine and the prices were ok. Overall, not deserving of high praise.   Oh and $3 draft Mondays would be the only reason I return.",

    "text": "Now, I hardly ever review on Yelp. I just stalk around. But Dandelion Market gave me no choice. On vacation in Charlotte from Richmond, Virginia my boyfriend and I chose this restaurant spend our three-year anniversary evening at based on Yelp reviews. For a Monday night there was a good amount of people present and the atmosphere is lovely. Compared to restaurants in Richmond that offers small plates, this plates beats them all. We had the sweet and spicy green beans, which were sweet, sticky, and delicious. The fried pickles with horse radish aioli which were excellently fried, the Brussels sprouts which were extremely flavorful and the pomme frites which were incredibly crispy and came with a delicious house made ketchup and we shared the ghiradelli salted caramel brownie sundae which was huge and only $6!!! The music is very tasteful, and our waitress Kylie was so attentive and sweet. 100% recommend this place if you're looking for a casual nice night out. Thank you Dandelion Market for topping off our vacation.",

It was a sleepy Sunday night, but the bartender was super helpful with suggestions for beer and plates.  After we ate, I wanted to kiss the chef.  It was that good.  The staff was excellent and very accommodating.  We started with the spinach, dried cranberry, pine nut and goat cheese salad, it was plenty for two, but because I'm a big fan of goat cheese, I would have liked more of it on top.  Next we had the Shrimp & Grits...Whoa.  Tasty buggers that pack some heat, but combined with the yummy cheesy grits cakes and roasted red pepper sauce, it was a great combo.  We had to order two more grit cakes, they were that addictive.  Next came my personal favorite, the lamb lollipops with greens and cherry sauce.  That is a \"wanna slap yo momma\" food!  Stupendous dish!  Next up was the Flat iron steak with mushrooms and onion straws! which was my dining companion's favorite of the night.  It was tender, flavorful and rich.  I was super full, but we ordered the Car Bomb Cupcake.  I wouldn't get it again.  The frosting was grainy, the cake a little dry and it was a disappointment.  It didn't evoke the classic car bomb flavors.  Parking is on the street where you can find it, free on weekends, or there is a garage nearby.  I would definitely go back if I was in town.",

Everything we ordered was delicious, and our server was knowledgeable and friendly.  I'll definitely make a point to come back.  Although we loved everything, here's a breakdown on each dish: The Southern Caprese = heavenly.  CC said this mozzarella is what all mozzarella wishes it could be.  This unique twist on a caprese is what every caprese wishes it could be. Tuna Tartare - succulent tuna, with a nice bite Sauteed Scallops - perfectly cooked, tender.  The macadamia nuts make a nice variation of texture. Prosciutto Crostini - the flavors blended together perfectly Mac n' cheese - delicious, smoky flavor.  However, with how out-of-this-world most of the other dishes were, it falls a little lower on my list.",

I'm not really passionate about this place, but I've been twice and it warrants a review.  The good:  The food.  Very very good and I feel like there's a good variety of unique offerings.  The bad:  The price.  The plates are tapas style and to get anywhere near 'full' be prepared to drop 40 large per person...not including alcohol or tip.  That's why I think I'm just so Meh on this place. There are far better offerings in Charlotte where I can pay 40-50 a head and actually be full and satisfied.  I'm never full or satisfied when I leave Dandelion.",

The patties were delicious.  The side of fruit looked like it was just scooped from a grocery's pre-cut fruit section.  The bottom of the bowl was filled with juice.    My Fiance had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  It was a tasty, classic grilled cheese sandwich.  And while it was tasty, I don't think the soup was made in kitchen.    As far as the food goes, based on the decor, name, and location I did expect something slightly more Artisan and handmade.  I guess I'll have to come back for dinner and try again.  The menu does look delicious, however I think Dandelion Market could put a little more into the quality of lunch.

Also, we went on a Tuesday and the drink special was 15$ bottles of wine! Not a bad selection either! Our waiter was great and super helpful when deciding what to order.  My only regret was that I was to full to try dessert! I will definitely make this a regular stop when I visit Charlotte!",

    "text": "I had been in the mood for grilled chicken wings all week and it's hard to find a restaurant that serves grilled wings. They're usually fried and greasy! After learning that the Dandelion Market had phenomenal GRILLED wings, I had to give it a try!   They recommended two meals per person because they are smaller plates for sharing. I ordered the fruit-n-nut salad. It had poached apples and pears, cranberries, figs, candied pecans, point reyes bleu cheese, mixed greens, citrus white balsamic and olive oil. I had them switch the blue cheese with goat cheese. My friend ordered the Mediterranean Trio and DANG...it was good! The trio had lemon garlic hummus, sun dried tomato tapenade, tabbouleh and pitas.  My wings came out after the salad and they were everything I hoped for and more. They were PERFECT! Crispy, sweet, spicy and juicy! My friend also ordered the black bean sliders and said they were the best vegetarian black bean sliders she's ever had.   I also had breakfast there a couple weeks back and I can't wait to go back again. I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this place out.I ordered the Dando veggie omelet with a side of bacon. The omelet had havarti cheese, tomatoes, peppers and onion. I love an omelet full of flavor and this one hit the spot. Their coffee was PERFECT. It tasted like French press.   My waitresses were super nice BOTH times and it's such a fun environment. The decor is dark and rustic. I love the lighting and the brick walls. You can sit upstairs or downstairs!",

We ordered two bottles of wine, and some tapas. There was a special on wine's by the bottle ($15 a bottle), and they were surprisingly good. We all ordered 2-3 small plates and shared everything. The lamb lollipops were a hit amongst the table, as well as the ahi tuna. The Szechuan green beans were a personal favorite. Lots of great items on the menu. Overall, the experience was great! Can't really beat great service AND great food.   Recently went back to this place and it was still wonderful. The service was great again, Thanks Sam! Ordered a few bottles of wine, and their lemon pound cake shots are AMAZING! The only new thing I tried that I hadn't already eaten before were the chicken wings and they were fantastic, as well. Thanks again for another great dining experience.",

I do remember we all commented on how delicious they were. The bar area is very nice, nice bar with \"angles\" so it's easier for a group of 4 to sit at the bar and see each other and talk.

Brunch food - taste was great, keep in mind this is not the place to go if you watch what you eat. I didn't see any lean meats available, it's all pork, sausage, beef etc. If you want to go veggie there will be lots of cheese. As long as you're ready and want to embrace it you will like it here because the flavor is great.  They are also really good about modifying, as they are cook to order as well. Also, do not look at the menu linked with Yelp because it's not accurate, just go to their website. They probably change it often, which keeps it fresh.   Drinks, great selection. Tons of beers on draft. Lots of cocktails and wines. Drinks are more pricey than other places close by.  Late night this place is a party upstairs, not a restaurant. Lots of attractive young people. Like 22-27 years olds. If that's you, you're in luck. Lots more girls than guys too. Maybe this is where we go to hide, so maybe I shouldn't announce that, but most people that are still reading this are females anyway. ;)",

Dandelion Market was perfect for what we needed. The waitress misled us a little bit and told us to order 2-3 items per person. We definitely ended up with too much food.

We ordered (in order of our favorites):   1. Patatas Bravas (surprisingly sooo good!) 2. Prosciutto Crostinis (our 2nd favorite with a good mix of sweet & salty)  3. Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops (these were good but a bit too raw for us so we asked for them to be cooked a little longer and then they came out perfect)  4.

    "text": "It looked like there was some seating upstairs but we were seated in the bar area which was pretty loud even on a Tuesday night owing to all of the hard surfaces in the room.   Sitting in a noisy bar had two effects on my experience: it made me want to pay pub prices for the food and it made me expect really good drinks.   The food was pretty good overall, but some things were better than others. The seared tuna and short rib were excellent, the sweet potato gnocchi good, and the brussels sprouts and prosciutto crostini were just OK. The sprouts were soggy rather than crispy roasted and the crostini had way too much balsamic on them. The brownie and ice cream dessert may have been the highlight of the meal.  $65 for those 6 dishes would have been reasonable and probably 4 starts from me, but factoring in the $30+ we spent on 3 mediocre cocktails drove the rating down. The cocktail menu looked good on paper so we passed up the $15/bottle Tuesday night wine special. That was a mistake. I had the \"Hot Blooded\" which was supposed to be a Bulleit Bourbon based cocktail, but I could hardly taste it. It was also served in a highball glass loaded to the top with ice, so I had to drink it quickly before the ice melted and diluted the drink even more. Not worth $12. When one of the hostesses came by to bus our dishes, she said how much she liked the drink, and I said it could use more bourbon. Rather than taking this as constructive criticism, she said, \"Oh, there's plenty of bourbon in there.\" I beg to differ.   The service was hit and miss. Our server (didn't catch her name) was great and very enthusiastic. Someone from the kitchen ran the food out and had the annoying tendency of letting go of the plates rather than setting them down. He was also inattentive to where on the table he was setting the plates, so it had the effect of slamming the plates down anywhere he could find a place.  Not sure the bar is good enough or the food consistent enough to warrant another visit to try more of the menu.",

Service was attentive and quick. The server checked on us but didn't hover. I ordered the roast beef sandwich on ciabatta bread with lettuce, tomato, carmelized onions and aioli with a side of fries. The sandwich was delicious and I enjoyed the crispy fries that came with their special ketchup. My colleagues ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and they all said it was terrific.  Everyone enjoyed their lunch and we were served and out the door quickly. I don't get to the uptown area often, but if I ever am I will stop in again.",

We arrived during  brunch time and there were plenty of options. First came complimentary homemade biscuits with house apple butter and blackberry preserves- both perfectly delicious. For our small plates we had the caprese & crispy prosciutto benedicts with a marvelous hollandaise sauce. Exceptional taste and very good presentation. Our server was delightful and friendly. Will definitely return!",

Limited healthy food options so I ordered the \"healthiest\" yet also tasty-sounding items on the menu:  - Half order (comes with 2) of the Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops- medium rare, dark sweet Cherries, spring mix, feta, red wine vinaigrette - Zucchini Lasagna- raw zucchini, heirloom tomatoes, sun dried tomato pesto, basil pesto, macadamia nut pesto   The lamb was cooked perfectly, but was not a fan of the cherry glaze. It's too sweet and candied, almost medicinal tasting. But if you don't eat the cherries or dip the lamb into the sauce, it still tastes good.   The zucchini lasagna was fresh tasting and flavorful. Keep in mind it is a cold dish so the zucchini has a super raw crunch and taste.",

I couldn't agree more, it's fantastic.  Our party of 4 arrived around 6:30 (no reservation) on a Friday night and easily found a table. I really like the vibe inside..it's cozy with the wood and brick.  The waitstaff explained how they work things (you order food, it comes out when it's ready) We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, grilled steak skewers, pan seared ahi tuna, fried pickles, meatballs marinara, baked potato croquettes and proscuitto crostini.  The only semi dud was the meatballs (too firm but tasty).  My favorites were (in this order) tuna, steak, proscuitto crostini.  The prices and portions are decent for sharing.  I've been to other tapas places and what I really liked about Dandelion is everything was kind of normal, not too foodie-out-there (i.e. what regular people eat).    YUM!",

We had the roasted garlic hummus and zucchini fries to start. The hummus really was garlic-y which is how my family likes it. The touch of crispy chickpeas and olives made it right. Following that, I ordered zucchini pasta, it was so much better than I expected given that it was cold. My parents ordered pan seared ahi tuna, tomato salad, and pork belly. The ahi tuna was absolutely amazing but I have nothing to compare it to, it was my first time having it anywhere. The salad was good, I didn't have very much and I had no pork belly but some of the grilled peach that came on the side so I can say the sauce of it was good. Such a great night here.",

In our two visits, my girlfriend and my favorite plates would have to be the lamb lollipops, brussell sprouts, and most of all the sweet potato gnocchi! The lamb lollipops are tender and come with a nice arugula salad with feta cheese and a tasty vinaigrette. Both of us have never liked brussell sprouts, but we decided to give it a shot based on our waiter's strong recommendation last visit. I have to say, try them! They have bacon and sweet golden beets that overcome the brussell sprout taste and make the dish surprisingly delicious. Lastly, the sweet potato gnocchi... I have dreams about those puffy clouds of sweet potatoes covered in whatever is in the amazing sage brown butter sauce. I would eat these every single day if I could!  The servers have been very friendly and seem very laid back. The prices are a little high for the amount of food you get (as with just about every tapas style restaurant), but the quality is worth it in my opinion.",

Because of my aforementioned experience drinking there, I had to do boozy brunch. The bartender made an excellent Bloody Mary that actually had a good kick to it. It paired excellently with the Migas, which you must get!! It's a banging egg scramble served in a skillet with tortillas on the side. The combination of the Latino-flavored dish and the spicy drink was fabulous.  Not only were the food and drinks awesome, they were wonderfully priced as well. Dandelion's menu rivals chain prices for brunch and delivers high quality. I will definitely start coming here more for food!",

The atmosphere was dark and intimate and the food was AMAZING!  Too bad I could barely converse with my partner across the table.  We came here on a Tuesday, and it was not terribly busy.  However, there was a large table of about 10 people here, and the noise was deafening.  We started off sitting right next to that table, but luckily we were able to move.  Since the downstairs area is relatively small, we couldn't move that far away.  Even at the new table, it was still pretty loud, but we could actually hear each other talk.    Anyway, that was the only negative.  Now - on with the positive.  They have a great selection of beers there, and on Tuesdays their bottles of wine are only $15!!  We had beer and decided to get four plates between the two of us.  We started off with the calamari, which was a surprisingly big portion for a \"small\" plate.  The calamari tasted fresh, the batter was light, crispy, and flavorful (almost like a light tempura batter).  This was served with a lemon aoli, which I thought had a great garlic flavor.  I really enjoyed this dish  After that came pan seared Ahi tuna.  It was perfectly cooked rare, and it tasted like it had never been frozen.  On the side is a wasabi aoli and sweet chili sauce.  Now, I do NOT like horseradish at all, which makes wasabi pretty much a deal breaker if even a little bit comes into contact with my food.  I actually enjoyed the aoli, which had only a hint of wasabi.  The chili sauce was awesomely flavorful and really complemented the aoli.  Very delicious!  The portion size was pretty decent for the price.  Next came the lamb lollipops and the autumn gnocchi.  These two items stole the show!  The lamb was very tender, and not overly seasoned.  The cherry sauce served with it was amazing, and it very much complemented the lamb.  Oh, and the gnocchi - HEAVENLY!  The squash was caramelized perfectly, and the dumplings themselves were tender.  The gnocchi was the best I've ever had.    Our server was friendly and attentive as well.  If it had not been so loud in there, I would have enjoyed the atmosphere a little more.  However, I can say that I greatly disliked the chairs there.  I have short legs, and I had to sit on end of the seat so my feet could touch the floor.  Next time I might have to try the plush-looking bar stools.  I am definitely coming back here again.  I give the food 5 stars for sure.  Overall, I'd rate it about 4.5 stars total.",

Nice start with good flavor.  Round 2 - Red Pepper Artichoke Dip, Shrimp and grits with goat cheese & a red pepper cream sauce--interesting as we first thought the shrimp was sitting on a crouton - actually was a \"grit cake\", creative!  Round 3 - Black Bean Sliders with house made guacamole and a grilled green tomato,  Pommes Frites.    Last round was a doozy - Market Mac-n-cheese with smoked pepper and buttered breadcrumbs and the Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops served medium rare with black cherries along side a spring mix with a feta vinaigrette....OHHHH MYYYY!  Lamb was the hit!!  All that can be said is \"we'll be back to try the rest of the menu!\"  Katie took wonderful care of us!  Wine specials on Tuesdays.  Nice craft selection of draft beer.

    "text": "Wow! That's my first and last impression. My two friends and I visited the Dandelion Market for our first time Sunday. The setting was cozy and cute, very nice atmosphere even though it was not very busy. We were greeted by a friendly face and seated in a table by the window we requested. Our server was so helpful and knowledgable about the dishes that we were confused about. She had made our experience really enjoyable.   I don't know what people don't understand about TAPAS - but that means small plates/portions - if you want a full sized entree go elsewhere. I on the other hand love Tapas style you get to try everything! And get stuffed.   For dinner we did the skewers, Mac and cheese, lamb lollipops, green beans, and pickles.  Oh my gosh! My senses went wild. The food was sooooo yummy! The meat dishes were tender. The Mac and cheese though simple - was delightful. The green beans were cooked perfectly.  Loved the pickles as well their ranch dipping sauce complimented them perfectly. Quality!! I really wanted to try more but we were stuffed the menu had a lot of options though, we will definitely be back.",

The music is a lot of rap and dub step so i'm not a huge fan of it. The upstairs gets really crowded and it can be hard to move around a lot. I don't know if this is every Saturday but last time i was there girls didn't have to pay cover so that's always a bonus. This is a place that i wouldn't necessarily choice to go to but i won't complained if i get dragged there.",

The steak was so tender and delicious! Calamari and mac n cheese were phenomenal! However, I'm not too sure if the turkey meatballs were fully cooked. They still seemed soft in the center.   Overall, the ambiance is great & I would recommend it.",

I got the Carolina Shore omelette and it was stuffed with visible chunks of lump crab, scallop, and prawn.  I got the hollandaise on the side, which made it a lot less heavy.  I still couldn't finish it, but I tried to pick out all the seafood.  The hash browns are definitely home fries, but they're crispy and tasty so no complaints there.  The bread basket options in the beginning are also pretty awesome.  Very impressed with Charlotte's food offerings.",

However, the breakfast menu was great with multiple options, a whole bloody mary bar, and warm buscuits served before the meal. I would say it's the best brunch place i've visited in Uptown in terms of food, but other options like 5Church have more of a comfortable and open setting. I also felt the menu was a bit pricey, but if you're interested in options like the Chesapeake omelette with crab and shrimp, then it's worth the extra change.",

They have a large selection of wines and beers...and a delicious caramel ice cream with a shot of Maker's Mark. We ordered the mussels (plump and yummy), mac and cheese, and portobello mushrooms (with a special dipping sauce). Apparently they had a very busy night and were out of half of their menu.  The service was great! Very attentive, yet not intruding. The crowd created a nice blend of chill and happy.   Great times, didn't break the bank, and fantastic atmosphere!",

    "text": "I'm visiting from California and I have met so many people by just walking around the city. They are always eager to answer any questions that I might have and I almost always ask, \"What restaurants would you recommend?\" I have Avery from Bank of America to thank for this recommendation :)  We came here on a Thursday evening, right after the bf got off of work. The hostess was welcoming as she led us to a seating area upstairs. The dim lighting and wood floors reminded me of a pub/tavern. Jerod, our waiter, explained to us that all the food items were tapas, which was perfect for us since we didn't want to eat too heavy. He said four dishes would be sufficient for the both of us. He recommended the black bean sliders and the green beans. I chose the pan seared ahi tuna ($12) and the black bean sliders ($8). He chose the butter sauteed sea scallops ($13) and the steamed mussels ($13).   The ahi came out first and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised at the presentation. Even though this place received great reviews on yelp, I guess I was expecting pub-looking food. I was mucho HAPPY with the presentation! Of course, the way that it tastes is more important, but hey! What can I say? I am a sucker for pretty food! There were about seven pieces of deliciousness with wasabi aoli, sweet chili sauce, and sesame soy perfectly presented on the plate.   Just as we polished off the ahi, the remaining parade of food came out of the kitchen. The black bean sliders tasted just as good as they looked. They were so cute! When we ordered, I could tell my bf wasn't too enthused with my choice on the sliders, but we were both fans after we ate them. The creamy texture of the guacamole and the green grilled tomato were a nice contrast to tasty black bean patty. I could see this dish being satisfying as a meal if they served it in a regular sized portion. The mussels were wading in a shallow plate of white wine, garlic, cream, and bacon and came with four pieces of crostini for dipping in the leftover sauce. I only wish the mussels came in a bowl so there would be more sauce! :p The scallops were good but, nonetheless, my least favorite. There were two very large scallops nestled next to a small bed of arugula. But I think the pomegranate drizzle was a little too sweet for me.   By the time we finished, the tables started to fill up around us and the noise level had gone up a notch. We hardly noticed though because we were so enamored with our meal. The portions were perfect, the quality of food surpassed my expectations, and the service was excellent. Although we got drenched walking in the rain on the way home, it was so worth it. I'll be adding Dandelion Market to my growing list of restaurants to revisit while staying in Uptown.",

The calamari was probably the biggest dish and the best small plate to share with four people. But, overall all the plates had plenty of tastings for all. The smallest portion was the sliders there were only two small sliders. For dessert we had the Carmel Brownie and the Key Lime Cheesecake, both were delicious!

The service is very friendly and efficient. I ordered the Low Country Hash without the eggs, and my boyfriend ordered the Migas. They were both decent after adding some salt and hot sauce... Greasy, but decent. The atmosphere here is a little weird for a brunch place. It's dark and dingy inside, like a bar (which I understand it is), but I like brunch places to be more lit up with natural lighting and larger windows, because, duh, it should brighten you up after a lazy morning! Also, any time someone opened the door to enter or leave, there was a gust of cold air that blew right in, and it was 30F outside! At one point, the hostess held the door open for a good amount of time, for a group of people descending down the stairs. Like, is that chivalry really necessary? And if it is, can't you just open the door for them when they get to it, instead of holding it open while they are 20 feet away as the other diners get frozen to their bones? I believe the second floor might be nicer, but that's not where they seated us so that's that. Also, what kind of a brunch place does not carry anything other than whole milk? No 2%, no skim, not even soy milk! So, overall, my experience was just meh. I don't think I'll go back.",

    "text": "I've eaten here a few times with friends and I absolutely love it.   Grilled cheese with prosciutto and tomato is outstanding, and their hash browns with house made ketchup are spicy and wonderfully. The Bellini is not overly sweet and delicious.   Also I suggest the prosciutto Benny and the fresh fruit as a side. I was impressed that they didn't over or undercook the egg, it came out just right.  The Benny is a bit small so a small plate is the perfect complement for a full meal.   The service is excellent and their decor is so quaint. The Bloody Mary bar is on point with tons of options and their selection of draft local beers is pretty good. Love it here and I always recommend it for brunch to all.",

    "text": "Dandelion is one of my favorite places to go in Charlotte if I'm hungry, but not too hungry. The atmosphere and food are both fantastic, especially if you're on a first or second date. They have bottles of wine all for $25 bucks, get out of town that's amazing, especially if you don't know much about wine and you're trying to impress a lady.  I don't feel like Dandelion needs more people singing it's praises, but last night I went and got the green beans.... wow, just wow. Never has such a simple food made me crave it the way Dandelion makes me crave it's green beans. They knocked that one out of the park.",

    "text": "I went here while on a business trip in Charlotte. I had heard from the locals that they had a good brunch and a bloody mary bar, so I trekked up there on my own on a Sunday afternoon. After debating the menu for a while  I ordered the Prosciutto Benny. I wish I could have ordered like four things because they all looked good, but eventually I went with the Prosciutto based on a Yelp recommendation. I was not disappointed.  The ambiance was almost like modern Tavern or bed and breakfast in the city. Very cozy with wooden floors. Not very crowded when I went. Oh.....and while I wasn't able to enjoy the Bloody Mary bar that day it had my mouth watering the whole time. Self-serve style with the toppings and pretty much every topping you can imagine including cold prawns for an extra couple bucks. Drinks looked reasonably priced too.  Great place for brunch, especially with a group of friends who like to have a good time. Casual. Be prepared to tap a DD or taxi if you plan on hitting the Bloody Mary bar. Things could get crazy. I hear it turns in to a crowded hot spot on Fridays and Saturdays.",

    "text": "We were only in Charlotte for one night, and Dandelion Market was where we started our Charlotte adventure. We passed by this place and said to ourselves \"this could be cool\". The place is pretty dark but still manages to keep a cozy, southern feel.  And so we sat at the bar at around 5 or 6 pm on a Friday night. It was pretty empty, so we sat down at the bar and began chit-chatting with our bartender. I think his name was Drew. Really cool guy!   I was pretty surprised that with the awesome beer selection at the bar (Arrogant Bastard on TAP..? Wow! ) , the place was empty for just after 5pm on a Friday. That was until some guy dressed in full-on J Crew prep wear sat down at the bar and ordered a Miller Light.... huh??!   We soon found out that Dandelion Market is more into the nightlife scene. We spent most of our visit watching staff and 7-8 bartenders prepare for the night to come. Stocking glasses, making sure there were enough lemons and cherries, etc.  Our bartender clued us in on other awesome places to check out while we were in CLT, which was much appreciated. We did visit most places that he recommended, and we felt like we got a really good feel for the city. +1 for awesome staff!  I don't think I'd be interested in visiting this place when they turn to crazy nightlife bar. It seems like they are going for two different crowds depending on the day and time, which I guess works for them. If I come back to CLT though, I'd be happy to return here for a beer or two.",

    "text": "Tonight we dined at the Dandelion Market prior to our showing of the Nucracker at Blumenthal Performing Art Center.  The restaurant is perfectly situated for a short walk after eating to attend a show there.  Anyway, we had reservations and the table was ready for us as soon as we walked in the door.  There were 9 of us eating.  We had three young boys with us (7 and 8 year olds) and were told the place was family friendly.  While it was quite a bit noisy in there at least the ends of the tables were able to converse, talking to someone from one end to the other was not an option though.  After ordering our drinks we waited a little bit for them to come around but that was really the only serving snafu.  The beer menu is quite good and the pints are priced reasonably well.  We opted to bring our own bottle of wine with us for those drinking that (the corking fee was $20).  All of the bottles are priced at $25 so even that is not too bad.   The food we ordered was really good.  The calamari I ordered was a good sharable size with plenty to go around.  we actually ordered two for our table but unfortunately one of our orders was given to another table but we had so much food we really didn't miss it, the waitress was apologetic for the mistake.  We order the pom frites which were really good as well, large baskets of them, we ordered two baskets of these and honestly it was too much even for the 9 of us.    The main courses were equally good.  I had the mussels which I was told was a full pound and I believe it.  My wife ordered the lamb lollipops and she really enjoyed it.  Others in our group said their food was good as well.  All told it was an excellent place.  I will return to try other dishes.  Really the only reason I knocked a star off was because of the serving snafu and the level of noise but it isn't a very big place.  I would certainly recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "I experienced the \"bar\" version of this place on Saturday night.   Man, was it packed.  It did have a pretty cool vibe to it, but it was hard to enjoy it when we were all standing shoulder to shoulder and my butt got grabbed a couple times (by people you don't want to grab your butt)....  I'm sure it was an accidental \"hey, how's it going?\"  but it made me feel a bit dirty.  Crowd aside, we did not even attempt to get drinks at the bar since it would have taken a parting of the red sea to get to... plus to fight the other thirsty patrons once you got to the front.  With all the people on the 2nd floor, the floor started to feel like it was bouncing at times... we went downstairs to escape the craziness and hung out on the fringes near the kitchen.  Don't know how much the cover was for guys since a friend of ours had passes for all of us... but there was a long line outside to get inside..... I may have felt cheated if I actually paid the cover.  Probably will give this place another chance - maybe it was just a bad night for me :(",

Some plates are huge like fries and Mac n cheese but others a very small-shrimp and grits. Servers will stagger your order so you can enjoy the food and not feel like you have to eat everything at once. Upstairs eating area is more favorable to me with dim lighting a more of a relaxed atmosphere. Great beer selection as well!",

    "text": "I need to preface this review by saying we only got to experience Dandelion Market on an early Monday afternoon.  My husband and I were the only 2 patrons in the place.  We grabbed seats at the bar and partook in a couple beers.  The hubby was super excited to visit this place because they have $3 pints on Mondays.  The beer menu was decent with around 20 beers available on draft.  Unfortunately they were all out of my first 2 choices of seasonal beer so I went with the trusty standby, OMB Mecktoberfest.    Our visit here was relaxing and comfortable.  The atmosphere of the downstairs area is really cozy.  Our bartender was very friendly and we chatted with him for a bit.  We were excited to hear they have live music during the weeknights that sets up downstairs.  Although we didn't get to try any of their food and I hear it gets busy late at night (especially on weekends), this is a very promising place to chill out in the late afternoon/early evening.  I imagine this could become our new Monday night spot due to the $3 pints.  I'll have to amend this review after trying their food.",
