The meats were fresh, the servings generous, and the cuts excellent. We we're given 6 different  sauces, all of which were delicious. The vegetables and side dishes were also fresh and we'll presented. The  dining rooms and rest rooms very immaculate as well. They were quite busy when we arrived and the atmosphere was lively. Can't comment on the beverages as we had water, but the choices were numerous and varied. We had a wonderful dinner and overall experience, can't wait to return.",

The side dishes, soups and meats were all below acceptable standards.  The \"octopus\" was squid.  The \"fatty beef\" Chadelbagi was tasteless and unrecognizable because of the way it was cut. Bulgogi was far too salty. Mushrooms dry, etc., etc. $30 for all you can eat would usually indicate you can eat it! For $30 you can eat like a king at a real Korean restaurant. My wife is Korean. She rated this the worst Korean food she's ever been served.  I've eaten Korean food all over the the Americas and Asia. Paraquay has better Korean.",

We went as a group of 6 and I dont recommend going with more than 4 people, it was difficult to cook on the small cooking surface for that many people. Meat was tasty, and the rice was good. Sauces were just okay, and are on the spicy side. I'm in no way an expert on Korean BBQ so this is just my limited take on the experience. Also, in case you were unaware as we were before we came, there is a 2 hour limit to dining if there is a wait list.",

They will not seat you until everyone in your party arrives. We were waiting on our third person and finally got seated at 530. I recommend going early to catch the first seating or expect a wait. Our server, Alex, was quick to greet us and take our drink orders. She also took our first orders of meet. Somewhere in the she also explained the cooking method and the sides they bring. It's all you can eat with a time limit of 2 hrs. Let's just say, we ate a lot. They will bring whatever you ask for, honestly at one point, I think I had to tap out. The manager come by several times, he even helped cook for us a few times and provided additional instruction. His wife, the owner, also stopped by the table to say hello. They have soju, a variety of flavors which while we didn't try them all, we did several bottles. They are small and like in S. Korea, it's more of shot type thing. All in all, we were there right at 2 hrs, although we stopped eating at probably 1.5 hrs. Overall, based on my handful of KBBQ experiences both in the states and in S. Korea, I'd say they do a great job. This concept is great for groups too. It's an experience. I definitely recommend Let's Meat! I give the owners props for bringing something totally different to Charlotte. A BIG THANK YOU!",

    "text": "Decided to come try Korean bbq for my 6 year anniversary with my boyfriend. When we first got there, (we were a couple minutes early) we were greeted by the managers who told us we had a couple minutes to wait, which we didn't mind. When they finally sat us down, our waitress came over and talked to us about what type of restaurant they were and helped us with everything we needed. She helped cook our meals for us, talked to us and just made us feel comfortable. Her personality was very bubbly and she was very attentive. A+ on the service! For the sides, we got all the tradition sides such as; kimchi, pickled radish, steamed bean sprouts, and all the other goodies! We ordered the garlic pork belly and the Bulgogi for our first tray of meats. Both were really great and I would have to say, my favorite! I also tried the spicy chicken, which honestly I wasn't too fond of. I felt like there was not enough flavor. We also ordered the corn and cheese on the random menu and to my surprise it was superb! The waitress suggested to eat it wrapped in lettuce and I did, it was good! One thing that I do find good but maybe bad to others is that, their portion is very small. I've had Korean bbq at other places and their meats come on a big tray versus this place delivers their meats in a small little side bowl. When we ordered the pork belly, it was only one piece, literally one slice of the pork belly. Its good because you can try different varieties of meat. But the downfall to that is, if I really like a certain type of meat, I have to keep reordering it. Other than that, I feel like everything was great! Definitely give it a try when you stop by!   On another note: I noticed that on their menu they are still adding more meats. So you are kind of limited.",

For $30/person, it's totally worth it to avoid having to purchase and prep the variety of meats and veggies/banchan from \"the Asian store\" to make a proper KBBQ myself. Definitely cheaper to make at home but is it worth the effort and buying in bulk quantities for a date night for two? No. Maybe for 5 or more.   Go if you even remotely like Asian flavor profiles or meat. It's worth it to support restaurants that are stepping out and doing something different than overpriced tacos or American fare. I'm tired of being bored with food options. Or just come to my house the next time we do KBBQ.",

For $30 a person, you can pretty much eat any type of meat you'd like (outside of galbi), and banchan you can think of - from cheese corn to jiggae to steamed eggs!

There have been a few places here and there, but this is the first KBBQ that I've seen here.   We had a table of 6 for my husbands birthday. We came for lunch on a Saturday. There was a very short wait, and we were seated at a nice (slightly small) table. We happened to come when the Galbi was not at an extra charge, which was a nice surprise.   They brought all of the side dishes, waters, and rice very quickly. Our server was friendly and helpful. She did a lot of the cooking for us which was very nice. She gave the rest of our group a nice intro course on what meats to order first and what all of the dishes are.   The best meat I had was the bulgogi - it was sweet, marinated, and delicious. We tried nearly all of the different options they had, and they all were great.  Something that I really liked about this place is that it was so clean! Most times after you eat KBBQ, your hair and clothes will smell very strongly like meat. That was not the case here.  I hope that Lets Meat continues to have good reviews and good business. I haven't tried the Seoul restaurant next door, but since they are the same owners, I am thoroughly excited to go.",

    "text": "Whenever I travel I like to seek out what I can't get at home. When we were in LA I fell in love with Korean BBQ only to be heartbroken that nowhere in CLT did the same all you can eat cook your own Korean BBQ that was so popular out in CA.   I called a couple weekends after they opened to see about getting a reservation. No dice and the man I spoke with said the weekend dinner rush wait was 1-2 hours. Ugh! No thank you! So we waited a couple more weeks and went for lunch. There was no crowd for our Saturday lunch and we had the almost undivided attention of our waiter. We went a second time for an early Sunday dinner (pretty close to 5) and it was busier but we were able to get in. Word of caution - they will not seat you until your whole party is there.   The basics - it is all you can eat and you cook it yourself. Or, in our case on the first visit, the waiter cooked it for the most part while we burned our tongues impatiently taking out items. The second time we went the waiter was much more hands off and we were cooking ourselves. You can order as many meats as you want, as well as refills of the amazing sides they bring. Just don't be greedy because waste will be charged.   Winner winner brisket dinner - in my humble opinion the thinly sliced brisket is the best choice. It comes unseasoned so you can choose any of the sauces they bring to dip it in, or cook it with garlic and jalapeno. It is also a good meat to start with since it cooks quickly.   Bulgoli beef is my second favorite followed up by the squid and newly added ribeye. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn't go crazy for pork belly but I have enjoyed the red wine and red pepper pork belly. I would pass on the egg souffle and beef chunks.   Possibly because it comes out raw the food comes out super quickly. While waiting between meats, or for meats to cook, there is a huge assortment of sides brought out when you are seated so there is always something to nibble on. So far we've had two great visits and writing this review makes me want to plan a third!",

Our waiter, Nathan (I think that was his name) was very nice, he explained that they are buffet style restaurant but will change 10% if there is good wasted. He helped us cook the food the while time, and made some excellent suggestion along the way on how to pair the meat, veggie and sauce. The restaurant was nicely decorated, seems clean and opened. $29.99 per person with all you can eat meat and veggies. The quality of food was very good, I particularly enjoyed the bulgogi beef, it was nicely marinaded and very tender. Very satisfying to know there is a authentic Korean BBQ in Charlotte now.",

    "text": "This is place is not only the KBBQ Charlotte wants, but honestly what Charlotte needs! Growing up in Charlotte, there used to be a few Korean BBQ joints here (none were AYCE), but over the years they have all closed their doors. As a kid in a blended bicultural family  we would make bulgogi and Kimichi after church on Sundays, so Korean food has always had a special place in my heart. Naturally I decided to go out with friends to Let's Meat for my birthday and to see if this place really lived up to the hype. Let me tell you as a KBBQ fanatic, this place is one of the best I have had in America (yup..that includes LA and San Diego).   The pros: * Friendly staff (shout out to Tim for being the best waiter staff ever) - super friendly, helpful, and very talkative.  *Meat quality  - the meat here is on point - they aren't cutting corners to save a little extra $$$ and I appreciate that!  * Banchan - all of the banchan was on point! My only compliant was the lack of Sigeumchi Namul and Eomuk Bokkeum.   Tips for KBBQ newbies -  *Ask for half orders - if you want to try something, but you aren't sure you will like it ask for a smaller order.  *Don't be shy to ask for help - grilling takes practice ( p.s those scissors are there to cut the meat)  * Use the Lime/Lemon to clean the grill  *Ask for lettuce and wrap your meat in lettuce with some radish and soy bean paste!  * Not a first date spot- who wants to stuff their face in front of a new date? But, definitely a place that I would go before getting serious with someone. If they can't get down with the grilled squid or turn up their nose to kimchi...things aren't looking good for the long haul.   Honestly can't wait to go back. Alcohol is a bit pricey, so if you're looking to relive your days in Seoul - pregame before coming to eat and then rent a Karaoke room next door.",

    "text": "I've had Kbbq at other major cities such as New York, Atlanta, etc. I was super excited when Let's Meat opened in Charlotte! My worst experience here was when I found a dead fly in my rice. When I showed management, they apologized profusely. That's good customer service. However, tonight made me feel really low and if anyone knows me, customer service is what makes it or breaks it for me at restaurants. After last night, they've lost one of their most loyal customers.   First off, don't order the beef chunks. I'm not sure if it was just an off night or what but they definitely tasted bad, like spoiled meat. The original pork belly was basically just a thick slab of fat. It was just inedible to me. Beef tongue was unpleasant as well.  Now onto what happened... Our server, Alec, barely did anything for our table. We went around 9:30 pm and the restaurant was definitely not busy. That didn't bother me though because I like to do all the cooking and flipping at our table anyways. I went with my girlfriend and niece who both got waters and I got a Sierra Mist. Since I was the one watching the food, I left my drink over to the other side of the table, closer to my girlfriend. When we got our check, we were rung up for two sodas. When asked about it, Alec said he would get his manager. The manager stated that since they noticed that there were \"exchanges\" with the drink between me and my girlfriend, they rang it up as two and her hands were tied about the matter.   Um, excuse me. What? Of course there were exchanges if I have to ask my girlfriend to pass me my drink. And yes, she took a sip but I was unaware that y'all were patrolling the area and that a sip would equate to a whole drink. Are you that money hungry for an additional $3 drink? Even so, I have been going to Let's Meat for so many times and have even forgiven you when I had the incident with the fly. As I mentioned, what I hated most was how they treated the situation and how poorly it was handled. I could care less about $3 honestly.   We didn't argue, I simply nodded, and we paid for our meal and left. After this experience, I won't ever be back and will rather drive to Atlanta where the food is better anyways.",

It's not self-serve. The portions they brought out were small but I liked that. This was my first time so the small portions allowed me to try many different items. Once you find the one you like, just keep ordering!  Kalbi is a premium item, so that's an additional $13 per order. I didn't think it was worth it because everything else on the menu was just as good or better.   For the softest and juiciest beef, get the beef chunks. The pork belly is a must have...yum! The squid and shrimp were also very good!  They don't have Pa Muchim (Scallion Salad) but they do have something similar, still good, but I do love and prefer all the scallions!  Definitely check it out!   The space is clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and very attentive, clean bathroom (though I got nervous and eventually resorted to karate kicking the handle of the toilet to get it to flush.. phew!)  Also, they taught me to use the lime to clean the grill after each round. This lime thing is amazing! They never have to change the grill and at the end of the meal, the grill was still so clean!  Oh! And no hot tea... which I thought was weird for an Asian restaurant.",

The very good thing about it is that they film the menu on a big screen in order to let you understand better what they offer (the bad thing is that I discovered that big screen at the end of the night).  The meat is nothing special. Nothing that is gonna make you say \"wow\". The seafood in my opinion is under the average.   In other situations I would probably rated a place like this 2 stars, but since it is a very very original restaurant, I rated it 3.   I hope in the future the food is gonna improve because it is probably one of the most original restaurants in Charlotte.",

My husband and I went on the 2nd day and were pleasantly surprised. There was a sign saying they were still hiring, but there was staff galore and everyone was so friendly. If you have never been before, they will walk you through the entire process and make your dinner as pleasant as possible. Once we were seated, they promptly brought out the side dishes (banchan) which were all fresh and delicious. We ordered the Korean Steamed Egg and White Rice as well to enjoy with our banchans. Our meats arrived just as fast as the side dishes and we went to work! My husband ordered bulgogi all night and I ordered the miso, garlic and original thin sliced pork belly. Everything, EVERYTHING was fresh, savory, and what we were hoping for. The owner even came to our table and cooked some of the meat for us! Overall: FOOD 5/5 fresh, marinated just right - authentic KBBQ Service 5/5 will take into consideration it was opening week, but they do take their time explaining KBBQ to first timers Cleanliness 5/5  Other criteria to consider: Parking seems it could be hard during busy times. We parked about 2 blocks away. They don't take reservations. It is $30 per person all you can eat within a 2 hour limit (more than enough time) cannot bring leftovers home so order accordingly. Soju needs 2+ drinkers to order.",

    "text": "First visit last night, VERY POOR SEATING/WAIT experience. We were party of 6, it was alright for us to wait an hour or so because we really want to have korean BBQ. Almost 2 hour marked, party of 8 people got seated before us when we have been waiting 30 minutes before them. WTF, 30 minutes was a significant amount of time! I went to the front desk and ask what is going on. She said they don't have avaialble rable for 6, but there are tables for 4. But still you dont treat your costumer that way! You talked to them and explain, give them option nit when they're waiting for 30 minutes ahead of the other customers you just seated! The lady pointed to the other staff that it was her fault. They should seat people strategically. I said yes, you have poor planning, look you have 2 people seated in an 8-people table. They should have asked us if we want to separate table since there's no available one to accommodate us but DO NOT SEAT the customer behind us when we have been waiting for more than an hour now! We finally got seated i don't know how after the fiasco because my son and I are so upset to what they did. Now another upsetting part, remember we are hyngry now and upset. Seated on a 1 burner table, can only get meat 3 at a time. I was thinking what, hownlong would it take us to be able to eat, we will be eating like chicken. You get 3 kinds of meat at a time, so ok. When the meat arrived, the were giving 1 piece of marinated pork belly as big as bacon slice, 1 piece of ribeye as big as my palm and 5 pieces of medium size shrimp. Wow, you got to be kidding me with 6 grown people, hungry and this is how much we are going to be looking forward to, It was torture. I have been to several korean place but this the worst.!!!!! The meat was so limited every time it arrives that i said this will be my last visit in this place. I will tell my friend about how bad it is. I would have not given a 1 star if I can. I am not hard to please and we usually get passed a bad customer service but this one I can't let go. They always say you pay for the service not the food. Well this one, the amount of money I paid was a big lost because of our bad experience",

The meat & banchans were good, not great. BUT! Korean BBQ is all about marinated short ribs (galbi) and pork belly (samgyupsal). I found it absurd and even upsetting that they charge $13.99 for galbi. Galbi should be standard, it's literally the definition of Korean BBQ. There are many different types of pork dishes, but even the pork bulgogi isn't your standard Korean pork bulgogi...it's not spicy; I just found that odd! It was worth going for the experience, but I'd rather buy galbi & samgyupsal from G-Mart or Peppero and make them myself for the money I spent here!",

    "text": "It's worth experiencing but i wouldn't go back unless it was to take out of town guess for a different, unique experience. Definitely not worth taking kids as they charge $11.99 for kids 4-10 n anyone over 10 gets charged adult prices of $30. Be sure to look over your check (i almost never look at the check n usually just put my cc n the check presenter without looking at the check) especially if you have a party of 6 or more since they auto grat for that which i have no problem with if they would not have overcharged me. We had 5 adults and a 3 year old child and the server still auto grat us. She never asked the age of our child and just charged $11.99 for him - I'm assuming so she could auto grat. Once i pointed out that he was only 3 (he ate maybe 3 bites of rice) she acted like she didn't know why (dead giveaway she knew exactly what she was doing by charging the $11.99 instead of saying she thought he was 4) the $11.99 was on there n would see if a manager would take the charge off. When we got the check again i reviewed it and the $11.99 charge was removed but our check amount was higher than before. This time there was a $23.95 charge added which we had to ask to get removed again. The auto grat was still on there but i didn't bother with it. I normally tip 20% as the norm and the server was actually pretty good (would've been excellent except she went missing at one point n we had empty beers) so i would've probably left 25% (would've left 30% if she wouldn't have gone MIA for a bit) but i guess she felt it was in her best interest to overcharge us n get the auto grat on as much as she could. I want to think it was just an honest mistake but with her not asking how old our child was and then the other charge getting put on there it leads me to believe she was only concern about padding her pocket. 3 for avg food, 4 for unique experience (would've a 5 if they had a broader choice of meats - half of it seemed to be different flavors of pork belly), 0 for dishonesty equals a 2.3 which bumps down to a 2 star.",

The curry one didn't have much flavor either that was disappointing. I think the only one that had flavor was the beef chunk; that was yummy. The service was really good though I didn't have to ask for refills for my side dishes... and there's a sweet sauce that makes up for the missing meat flavor which was bomb! Like a sweet sauce. Buts it's good for Charlotte... would I go again eh only if I was craving Korean bbq. I would rather go to Seoul food if I had to pick between the two. Oh btw they need a bigger parking lot took us about 15 minutes plus to find parking.",

The food was amazing and I never ran out of food the server always made sure we werent missing anything! The only hiccup is the wait time. I was quoted an hour but we didn't actually get to sit and eat until 2 and a half! I would have usually been upset if I had my daughter but it was date night and I had the hubs instead. They did just open so I understand the challenges they are currently facing. I'll give it another month to see how the fix the wait time! All in All worth the trip and money!",

The staff are super friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is upbeat. And most importantly, the food is excellent. I tend to be a bit skeptical of all you can eat kbbq, as the quality of the meat is usually subpar. However, Let's Meat offered great quality food all the way around - from the meat to the side dishes, it was exactly what we have been waiting for in Charlotte. The kimchi is delicious and I would recommend the bulgogi and pork belly. We will definitely be repeat customers. Highly recommend it!",

The cooking of squid was really interesting. Bulgogi, pork belly and beef chunk were more fatty and salty.   My waiter, Carl, was super nice and helpful! He was the sweetest waiter I could ever imagine. The people here were all really nice and happy.   Overall, this is a must-try place in NC if you are into Korean/Japanese bbq. To be completely honest, this is not a place comparable to Gyu-Kaku. But it is truly crown jewel in North Carolina.",

    "text": "As soon as I heard about this place, I couldn't wait to try it. Luckily, it wasn't announced much before they opened, so I didn't have to wait long. I love Seoul Food and Meat Company, so I figured they would do a good job with this as well.   Boy was I right. This immediately jumped to be one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants. The food is outstanding. It's all you can eat for $30. There's a 2 hour limit, but we were told it wasn't strictly enforced. If you can eat that much meat for 2 hours straight, I'd be impressed. They have a bunch of pork and beef options and a chicken option. Everything we tried was great. The chicken was probably at the bottom of the list. The non-marinated meats and the beef options were our favorites. The sides were awesome as well. We all loved the dipping sauces too.   The service is superb. They have you order 3 meats at a time and they are constantly checking back to see what you want to order next. You cook your own meat on a grill on the table which is awesome. The waiter will help you get started and it's pretty easy. They are helpful with recommendations and bring your uncooked food out almost immediately. You are pretty much never waiting for food.   We had heard how busy and popular it was, so we got there 5 minutes before they opened and there was already at least a 10 person line. We were still seated right when they opened, but it was pretty impressive. It seems like they get people through pretty fast. There were only a few people waiting when we left.   It may seem a little pricey, but what you get is worth it. I could not recommend this place not more highly. It's a must try on the Charlotte restaurant scene!",

    "text": "I can't lie... I don't know why you would go anywhere else if you wanted a ton of meat with an Asian flair. Let's Meat is Charlotte's first True Korean BBQ joint and it has been met which an overwhelmingly positive lot of feedback. This is due to a extensively well trained front of house, who understand that the vast majority of their customers are unfamiliar with this cuisine. Follow that up with an amazing back of house that make the concept inviting and easy to understand, this is key to getting people to step out of their comfort zone and try something new!  Tuesday night was the night. I figured it wouldn't be too crazy on a Tuesday, boy was I wrong. The hype has already spread around the hive and they were slammed. Surprisingly, while there were a few large parties waiting for a big table, they were able to seat me and my girlfriend immediately. The consensus among most reviews is that the service is outstanding. Indeed, they have a ton of people running around tending to every table. Dedicated Food Runners bringing out the sides, sauces, and meat. Servers who are really well versed in explaining the process. If it's you're first time they'll walk you through the menu and even cook your first few servings of meat, as well as continuously check in on your meats once you've taken the reins.  My god, not only was it easy, it was damn delicious. A lot of places around the QC that have pork belly either serve it with a generous amount that has no sear, or use the thinnest or cheapest cuts they can get. Genuinely great pork belly is hard to come by around here, but this kBBQ grill is perfect for it. Super thick cuts and all you can eat, you'll get a slight bit of char with a perfect, golden-brown sear if you do it right. The best part, you can flip your meat as many times as you want and it doesn't change the outcome at all. The whole concept is super fun.  Along with the meats, you'll get all kinds of other great additions to dinner like kimchi, steamed bean sprouts, plenty of rice, pickled daikon radish, seaweed salad, and my personal favorite: garlic stems! The stems are cooked down and served with this light, slightly sweet red sauce that is wonderful. You'll get some lettuce to make your own wacky wrap combinations as well.  Our server and 'instructor' Tim was just fantastic. Every extra side we wanted was brought within seconds and he showed us all the tricks of the trade to make the most out of the new concept. Another guy named David also stopped by and showed us his take on using different ingredients together to make delicious bites of meaty goodness. These people really want you leaving with a smile and to get that 'wow' factor.  They have a few slots on their menu labeled 'coming soon' so I can't wait to see what else they have in store. Right now they have beef, pork belly, chicken, veggie plates, and kalbi (short ribs) which is actually the only plate you'll pay extra for. We didn't try the short ribs because of the incredible value you get from the standard fixed price.  I can't recommend this place enough. $30 per person, plus your drink, and you'll be in meat heaven. Only a couple of blocks from the Bland St. light rail station, it's super convenient and super fun! We'll be back with the whole fam next time!",

It is good to enjoy various side dishes(banchan) including kimchi.(grilling kimchi and pork belly(samkyusal) is always awesome)   If you are a meat lover and want to enjoy different kind of meat at the same time, it is worthy it. Wish they could serve simple dessert at the end of the meal like other typical Korean BBQ places:)",

Your options include spicy chicken, shrimp, beef short ribs, pork, steak, squid, etc...the cheesy corn is a favorite. You pay roughly $30 and order your meats, the sides and spices are brought to your table, you choose additional sides such as salads, rice noodles and/or rice (white/brown). You cook your selections on the grill located in the center of your table. Great presentation and you can cook multiple items at same time.  You keep ordering whatever selections you like at no additional cost. Eat until you are satisfied, try each item on menu if you desire...  Beer/wine selections avail but not included in the $30 charge. The time limit per table is about 2 hours.... Ample parking but on a busy night you may find it difficult to find an open spot.",

We also started with some Soju. A bit in, our waiter brought us out a beer and recommended pouring some Soju in a cup with beer. Absolutely great tip!   There were so many meat options and we had fun trying them in rotations. I was surprised at how quick they brought everything out! The GM stopped at our table and showed us some variations she likes to do. Service was spot on awesome.   Absolutely fun meal and evening!",

He told us that it will be an hour a wait but when our party got there he sat us right away. The food is good and fresh. Service is excellent. Except the front desk/ host was terrible we almost left the restaurant to go somewhere else.",

I really love the way the place is laid out. Super clean and beautiful bathrooms, awesome wall murals... I just really like the way it's been done. Classy but casual, has both form and function.   Cost of an amazing experience for 4 was almost $200 including drinks and tips. I was in Chicago not long ago and paid more than double that for a party of 4, and the food here got the one in Chicago beat by a mile.   Their sides are all very well done... nice to see they gave each and all the same level of attention. Speaking of attention, staff were awesome!!! They were always on top of everything which we appreciated very much.   Meats were all super fresh, excellent sauces seasoned oils... just absolutely everything about the experience was pleasant. Will definitely return when I'm in the area.",

The cow tongue was particularly good, as was the beef brisket and bulgolgi. The side dishes were decent.  Egg souffle and spicy cold noodles were delicious as well. Got a bit tired of cooking the food half way through. The tong is a little too large to handle the small pieces of meat. I've only been to korean bbqs where the staff grilled for you so a little instruction and tips would've been helpful. Bit pricey at $30, and kalbi costs an extra $13.99 i think. but it's really the only korean bbq in town so try it out. It's pretty good.",

    "text": "The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because we did not know how expensive it was going to be when we walked in and sat down. Some would argue $30 for dinner is normal, but for those on a budget, it is easy to feel duped when you sit down and realize that you will be paying $30 for your meal and will be fined an extra 10% if there are any leftovers when you finish. We should have done our research, I will say that for sure. But I am glad we stayed for the meal because it was an incredible experience and well worth it!   We were served immediately as we sat down and platters of various sides and sauces were brought to our table within seconds. Let's Meat offers unlimited meats and sides from various categories: Beef, Pork, Chicken, Shrimp, Squid, etc... so our group ordered at least 1 item from each category to try and get our money's worth. Everything was amazing!! And the different sauces available extended our combination options and added an element of guest creativity. Consensus from the table was that beef bulgogi was the favorite, but those willing to try the squid contended that it was a close second. Our server stopped by often, which was helpful since our group had never been before. I assume that in a date setting they would be a little more hands off, because I would be less inclined to come back knowing someone would be interrupting me every 5 minutes. But I will give the benefit of the doubt and assume our waiter was only visiting so often because he knew we were all new!   I will definitely come back here again, but will plan it out for a time when I have the appetite to eat and the appetite to spend.",

    "text": "All right guys. Charlotte finally got their first all you can eat kbbq, and I have to admit, it's pretty fucking good. After having some of the best Korean bbq from cities like Atlanta and DC, I had pretty high standards but knowing this was a first for Charlotte I lowered my standards. As far as the 2 hour limit, that's not an issue. Your gonna be full by the first hour (if you need more than 2 hours to eat, you have a problem lol). I think I've gotten lucky the couple times I've came here, not having to wait more than 5-10 min to get a table. Parking can be tricky and of course it's first come first serve so no reservations. Once you get in, you won't be disappointed. We were allowed to get 3 orders of meat at a time. I'd suggest sticking to your \"more expensive\" meats such as beef or seafood rather than chicken. My favorites are the beef bulgogi, and fatty brisket. My only complaint is food comes out randomly and the servers don't seem to care, what I mean is we ordered 3 sides of white rice and the server only brought us 2, when we asked about the 3rd, they had to \"double check\" the ticket at which point we were told the rice is still cooking. That was just a minor hiccup, it happens. I'm not gonna get my panties in a bunch over rice, of course I'm there for the bbq . If your still deciding if you should try this place, it's definitely an experience you'll enjoy, and there's plenty on the menu that will suit your fancy.",

    "text": "Very excited that Charlotte uptown opens a new restaurant. My boyfriend and I went there for Sunday afternoon; the overall experience was great.  Pros: 1. Our waiter, Green, was very helpful and nice. He came to our table quite often, telling us BBQ technics and asking if we wanted more food. 2. The meet was awesome. We ordered pork belly, beef tongue, beef briskets and beef chucks. They were marinated in a nice way and very tasty. 3. The appetizers were good, along with side dishes such as the corn cheese and egg souffle. 4. I liked the drinks, especially the grape juice. $2 each is a fair price.  Cons: 1. We arrived at the restaurant at 4:33pm and there was a long line outside. The place opened at 4:30pm but it seems that there were only one or two people who led the customers to the table, so the \"welcoming section\" is not very efficient. 2. There was a \"coming soon\" section on the menu, so I guess the restaurant is still improving its selection. I would like to have some kind of seafood if possible. 3. We were among the first group entering the restaurant, but we were told that they ran out of thin sliced pork belly; did not expect it to happen.  For $30 pp, this is a place worth trying if you love meat (especially beef). We plan to come here once a month in the future (if no other good place is opening ).",

Thank goodness we came when we did because they had kalbi included in their all you can eat menu for a short period! Our waitress was kind and had help teach us how to cook the meat and always kept our stove clean. There were so many meats to choose from and sides. My favorite meat there was probably the pork bolgigi. The egg souffle was soft and good. I've never had cold spicy noodles before, but it went pretty good with the meat. They give you plenty of side dishes to share too. The restaurant was cute and I enjoyed the layout. They don't have great Korean BBQ places where I'm from so I'm glad we had tried out this place. They give you 2 hours for all you can eat, but this is definitely more than enough time. Each plate comes out with a good amount of meat so you will get filled up pretty quickly!",

The service from the food runners, the host, the business manager on top of that tipped this review from a 4 to a 5. i've never seen this selection of meats before, they've got pork butt, different flavors of pork belly, and they include egg souffle (!!!!) on the buffet. despite the higher price of $30 per person (not that much more than the $26 that i'm used to). They've got a tooooon of veggie sides and they slice all the meats and the radishes SO damn thin. I wish they had one of these down south.  They also allow you to do half orders of meat in case you want to try something but are scared you can't finish it. the only complaint i have is that their bulgogi is a little on the salty side. other than that i can't say anything else negative about the place. so happy to have spent a chilly night inside this store.",

I think my favorite would be the pork bulgogi and beef tongue. I felt like the menu was pretty limited in terms of meat options. We want to get the galbi for $13 - needless to say we did not order that since we were paying $30 a person already. We ordered other random sides such as rice, lettuce, vegetables, bone marrow broth, and the fermented bean soup. We had to continue ordering the lettuce multiple times because each order came out with like 2 or 3 pieces. The bone marrow both was so bland and I would not recommended getting this. We ordered the mushrooms too, but it didn't come out but we were already very full at that time. Service was great, our server was very attentive and helpful.",

    "text": "Please do better!  You're the *only* AYCE Korean bbq in Charlotte and you should set a high standard.  This review is going to be honest and straightforward, as I've eaten at quite a few Korean BBQ places in Cali, NY, NJ and FL where I have lived  Service- very good. The wait staff is on point, food came out rather quickly. Very attentive to our needs (and there wasn't many), accommodating and receptive.   Atmosphere- it's located next to its sister restaurant so they share the same modern-esque concrete wall and industrial look.  It was a little loud from the music and people conversing, the sounds bounce off the walls as there isn't anything to dampen the hubbub.  We didn't mind, it livened up the place.   The food-  well, here is what I am hoping they would do better on. I asked for hot tea, since it was raining pretty hard out and we sat in the car for 20 minutes as there wasn't any standing room to wait to be seated. No reservations so we pretty much took a chance on a dreary rainy Thursday night.   The don't serve anything hot. No hot tea, no green tea, no Barley or Corn tea... right.  So beer it is.   So we ordered the four choices of beef to start with, 2 flavored, a brisket and the tongue. We also ordered the egg souffle, a couple bowls of rice and the mushrooms.  The banchan came out quickly, followed by the freshly sliced semi frozen brisket and tongue. I quickly threw those on the grill without hesitance. The rice came out next, it had formed a chewy crust on top making it seem like it had been sitting for a while.  As I prepared myself for the first bite of the first meat of the first Korean bbq in Charlotte, I noticed the cooking tongue had a white circumference. Without thinking too much about it, I grabbed a Cooked piece, chewed it and began to gag so I spit it out. It seems like someone had FORGOTTEN to CLEAN it.  Yup. Someone forgot to peel off the rough sharp outer layer surrounding the bovine's tongue, I gagged because it felt like i had just swallowed a Rose bush.  Why did i order this you ask?  Because if you've ever had it, you know tongue is good when it's good.   I told our server about the issue and even had him touch the spikes on the raw tongue and said he would inform and get the manager....  who never came.  We figured who the manager was after a few minutes but she was clearly too busy (or maybe didn't want to be bothered?) by our issue.  She walked frantically between tables, to the front desk and to the back without smiling much. We didn't want to make a big deal about it so just sucked it up to a lost cause.   Souffle was left on the stovetop for 2 minutes too long, the eggs were pretty much scrambled in soup when we ate it. It's supposed to be sorta on the silky side. Good flavor tho.   The brisket was simply ok, it was cut a little too thin (it was a little fatty too) so it pretty much turned to a messy cheesesteak type material. If only I had some bread, onions and cheese I coulda made a legit Philly.    The flavors on the other two beef dishes were also just ok, it felt a little \"toned down\" to cater to the general taste... it didn't quite taste as authentic as I've had before.  I didn't get the saltiness and umami of the soy, the heavy aroma of the sesame oil or punch of the pepper flakes or garlic; I felt like I was eating sweet meat and a little hint of something something.   Oh, and about the portions, they give you about 1/2 cup worth of meat so you have to order three times as much to feel like you're actually eating something... listen I'm no heffer. I just dislike having to flag someone down for more food especially since I have to cook it too!  We ordered the pork dishes next, and I understand while it says pork belly... it felt like I was eating lard belly.  It was mostly fat to be honest, I had to cut out a fair amount of the white jiggly stuff just so I didn't have to shave off a few years of my life. The wine pork belly was decent, the curry one didn't have much curry flavor (weird because it was so yellow, you'd think it was loaded) and the hot pepper pork... wasn't even worthy of any scoville units.    The king mushrooms were dry (it's not that hard to slice them real quick per order is it?) and after that we decided to call it quits since we were told (when we first got there) that it's a 2 hour seating. It felt like they were already asking us to leave before we even ordered.  Hello, welcome, you have two hours, ready to order and GO!    So all in all, I hope this is read by anyone who care enough to read it, and by the owners.  This place really has the potential to really make a name for itself.  I understand that Charlotte is a young, growing expanding town, now is the time to set a benchmark to be the only place in town that's worth going to.   I gave two stars and I'm hoping to give 4 or 5 after I finally get over the fear of the tongue incident!  Really though, who doesn't like a good tongue?!",

Your closest options before we're on independence and for me it was a bit of a trek for a small plate of food.  If it's your first time make sure you let them know as it's an experience that can be made or broken by the server.  However if you've got a friend that's been it would be great to bring them along.  This is the only place to get AYCE KBBQ for now and my only draw back is that you've got to pay a lot extra for Kalbi and some other meats while all the other places I've been have it included.  I will say those places are in cities that have multiple options so they've got to stay competitive.  Over all the food is good and service isn't to bad, come hungry and ready to eat to get your monies worth $30 get you fed and they've got a verity of Korean 21 and up options as well as soda.",

I love how the order comes out in small quantity versus slabs and plates of meat. This made the dining experience so much better. I am also a firm believer in not wasting food. Although the pork belly came by the slice, it was amazing. It gave us an opportunity to try the different marinades and flavors. That was a plus! I had no complaint about the variety of meat. It was perfect without being too overwhelming. The spacious of the restaurant was a major plus! There were enough space between each table for privacy. Overall, it was an amazing experience. The price point was perfect, especially for a city without many options when it comes to Kbbq.  I can't wait to visit again.",

    "text": "This spot has the groundwork to be something special but what they really need is competition. Let's Meat KBBQ is your typical communal KBBQ experience where you come together with friends to enjoy the meats, soju, and laughter. It's not amazing high-quality meat, but it's more about having a good time. Take it from a Korean-American dude currently living in KBBQ heaven that is Southern California for the last 4 years--this spot is solid for the area, but it can be so much better.  Food: First, a quick guide on how to start your first order: Ask for chopped garlic and jalapenos to add to your cooking meat. Order salad (to be eaten together with meat for balance), fermented bean paste, steamed egg, fermented bean soup (doenjang jjigae), and spicy tofu soup (soondubu). Don't worry about overwhelming the server, this is what they're trained for. Best of all, it's all free and comes with the meal! As for meats, start with a couple plates of thinly sliced beef brisket and move onto heavier meats like steak and pork belly in the middle of the meal and finally finish with more beef brisket. Dip your cooked meats in the brisket sauce, chili sauce, sesame oil/salt combo, or bean paste. Eat with salad and radish paper for more balanced, flavorful bites.  The selection of meats is kind of limited and you can't get any marinated beef dishes (yangnyeom galbi) without paying an additional $13.99. You're pretty much stuck with brisket, steak, bulgogi (which is marinated but it's a waste of money to order this filler food, trust me), and pork belly. Overall the meat was just okay in quality--don't expect perfectly marbled wagyu. Of note, the steak was cut disastrously. The pork belly was okay as well--nothing particularly special.  Price: $30 before tax and tip is ridiculous. I'm a firm believer that no KBBQ spot (unless it's a la carte or marketed to be high-end) should be this expensive ESPECIALLY considering Let's Meat's limited menu.. This price point is purely a result of absolute lack of competition. Unfortunately, until there's pressure from competition, they'll have no incentive to make the price more reasonable. Moreover, the $13.99 extra for EACH plate of galbi is RIDICULOUS. A plate limit of 1 per customer would be much more reasonable at the very least.  Overall, while it's great that Charlotte has a KBBQ spot, the price and limited selection make it hard to justify coming back frequently. Come try them out for your first KBBQ experience but just know that there's much better out there!",

We had eight people so it was a full two tables.  I enjoyed the different meats and thought they were decent quality and the selection was solid with the options of Ribeye, chicken, shrimp, and pork belly.  All of it fresh but as you know you have to cook it yourself .  Overall a good experience but a little pricey for what you actually get and I probably will go back at some point but not for a while.  I also felt frustrated with the seasonings on the meat and a lot of times was missing out because I lack the experience with which Korean spices I like the best.  This issue left much of the meat sort of bland and forgettable which is a shame.   Value:  4/10 Service:  10/10 Food:  7/10 Ambiance:  8/10",

I was excited to hear about Let's Meat opening, but didn't get my chance to try it until after one of the Panther's games a few weeks back. Overall my wife and I had an amazing experience and certainly would recommend everyone getting out of their comfort zone and giving this a try!  Just to be clear, this concept is where you have a stove top in front of you and raw meats are brought to you for you to cook and enjoy with a cornucopia of sides. While my previous experiences of self cooking are more fondue style (not really fun for me), this is a bit different with the meats being really thinly sliced and an all-you-can-eat concept ordering while you go with a 2 hour window to enjoy the experience. I would recommend giving many things a try and realize that you will end up going meat heavy whether you plan to or not, so certainly plan to come hungry.   I'll also give a shout out to the service as both our waiter and manager were incredibly nice and helped us walk through (and even cooked) some of their favorites which certainly added to the experience. Also considering the atmosphere, I would recommend bringing a party of 4-6 here as it allows you to try everything without killing yourself. We certainly plan to be back and bring some friends and family with us for reinforcements.",

    "text": "I waited 4 years for Charlotte to get a KBBQ joint. An authentic one. So when I found out about this place - I knew this was where I was going for my Mother's Day dinner.   I called ahead and asked how long the wait time was - they told me about 20-30 minutes on the phone. However, when we arrived our wait time was less than 15 minutes.   I anticipated it being a flat $29.99 for all of us but they have an adjusted rate for kids $11.99 for under a certain age. I cannot remember the cut off now.   Once you are seated at the table, they will ask you if you are familiar with KBBQ. We are, so they didn't explain everything to us other than how they operate. You get to start with 3 choices of meats and then reorder as you like.   Some KBBQ will cook the meat for you and others you have to cook yourself. This one you have to cook yourself. This really gives the dining experience a fun vibe to it. Once you get familiar with what meats cook the fastest (fatty brisket), you can cook those first  and eat that while the other meats that take longer to cook are cooking.   I really enjoyed their banchan - it was a good assortment but what I didn't like is that if you wanted soup or the egg souffle you had to ask for it, they don't bring it out as part of the banchan assortment. The kimchi was good, very flavorful. I really enjoyed the tofu. It was properly seasoned - but it is served cold. I have had better potato salad at other KBBQ and we didn't even really touch theirs. It was quite bland.   The meat is good - the variety of choices is pretty standard. We did not try all the marinated meats because the more marinated meats you cook, the stickier your grill gets, the smokier it gets and well that is no fun. And the marinated pork belly that we did try, wasn't super flavorful anyways - so we stuck with the plain.   It is loud here. I mean very loud. SUPER LOUD. The music is so loud, so people are talking loud just so you can hear and it's just LOUD. My son kept complaining and I can understand why.   The staff was amazing. They were friendly, helpful and on point. We will definitely be back. I love KBBQ.  And I should have taken more photos but I was busy cooking and eating. Oops.",

They have a great assortment of beef dishes to try as well as pork belly.  There are 8 different kinds of pork belly, of which I had the lemon garlic & curry.  I also had multiple servings of bulgogi and the fatty brisket.  You have to get the brisket, it cools quickly and goes very well in a lettuce wrap.

But we order rib eye steak and pork belly, the color of the meat looks different from my previous visit. They don't look fresh, not sure how long they keep their meet. Additionally, the steak also taste a little sour without any dipping sauce. The side dishes not fresh neither, kimchi, potatoes salad taste different from my previous visit and look greasy. It happened couple of times in my recent visit, Safe to say will not be back.",

They don't have a full bar. Wish they'd add one. And note this is a fixed price menu, tagging along to nibble on something with a group isn't really an option here. Go hungry. They give you a two hour time limit, but honestly I don't see how anyone could possibly have an issue with that given you start getting your food and cooking it up at your table almost immediately upon being seated.   I wish they'd dim the lights. I find it entirely too bright.  Other than that and adding a full bar I think they've nailed it and added a new cuisine that Charlotte needed for a long time!",

    "text": "This was honestly one of the best meals I've had in a while. There are tons of neat, delicious, places to eat around the Queen City, but Let's Meat KBBQ is definitely in the top tier.  We arrived at the restaurant around 8:30 Saturday night and they said it would be about a thirty to forty minute wait before we could be seated. Not ideal, but it was the weekend and the place was packed. Undeterred we decided to walk up the block to Unknown Brewery to kill some time and were happily surprised to get our \"ready to be seated\" text earlier than expected (maybe twenty five minutes?). We made our way back and were promptly shown to our table.  Walking past the counter in to the dining area you can really appreciate the look of the place. Super simple, super clean, just enough character. The walls are about 80% just plain white stone, but there are a few super colorful Asian themed murals scattered about. One wall (right behind our table) also had a projector with what seemed to be a little how to video for the tabletop grills. The seating itself and the table dividers are unstained clear coated wood and the tables seem to be granite with a just bigger than dinner plate sized flat top grill in the middle.   We were quickly greeted by our wonderful waiter Green (yes like the color) who took our drink orders and began to explain the menu and process for ordering and cooking everything. Our drinks came out quickly along with all the accouterments for the meal. Salad, perfectly cooked rice, Kim chi, no less than four different sauces, radish, corn cheese bowls, marinated tofu, lettuce wraps and a few different sprouts. They really want to make sure you have options once the meat hits the table, and hit the table it did.  We tried so many wonderful things it's hard to keep track of it all. We started with the Standard Pork Belly. If you like a nice fatty piece of bacon this will be heaven for you, and since you're in charge of cooking your own food, you can make it as just as crispy as you want. (We also tried the garlic pork belly and wine pork belly!) Then it was time for the Spicy Chicken. Really flavorful but honestly not as good as their other options. The True gems though were of the cow variety. The Fatty Beef Brisket was outstanding. Super thin slices of wonderfully marbled meat, just sear, dip and enjoy. It was almost like if you took the thinly sliced/shaved meat off of a philly cheesesteak and dipped it into a world of wonderful Korean flavors.  I thought it couldn't get any better than the brisket, then we ordered the Beef Bulgogi. Oh boy. You can't go wrong with any of the items we tried, but the Beef Bulgogi is something you can sit down and get lost in the flavor of, and easily lose track of how much you've eaten. It's sort of similar to the brisket in appearance, thin (though not super thin) pieces of meat, but you can tell the difference in smell as soon as it hits the grill. The Bulgogi is marinated in a variation of the house sauce (one of the four you get with all your sides and things) and it is so damn delicious. I'm not sure if the meat is just more tender from the marinade, or the sauce really is just that delicious, but I could order nothing save for that one item and be perfectly happy. Those tiny pieces of beef are truly worth the price of admission.  This dinner was such a wonderful experience. Green always kept our drinks full, made sure our food always came out quickly and had no problem providing some friendly chit-chat along the way. I haven't had an overall dining experience this pleasant in some time. I imagine some might be turned off by the price but it really is worth every penny. The amount and quality of food provided, along with the wonderful staff and atmosphere makes this place a real treasure. Please, do yourself a favor and come visit this place. You will be so glad you did.",

You have a two hour limit but i was so full and didn't even worry about hitting the time limit. Whenever you order anything it comes out extremely quick so you can take your time eating and not worry about waiting for new food items to come back. They don't take reservations so I recommend going early.",

I've been a huge fan of Seoul Food next door since I moved to Charlotte so when I heard they were opening up a sister kbbq place RIGHT BESIDE Seoul, I got super excited. I thought, \"How could this not be a slam dunk?\"   I was right.  LET'S MEAT IS FREAKIN AWESOME. I'm sure everything I've said has been said before so I'll keep this short.  First of all, they have a rotating slideshow on the wall that helps put a word to everything you'll see throughout your meal. That's sides and meats. Very helpful!  It's $30 for AYCE and my god can you feast at this place. Our server was bringing meat out at record pace and was extremely helpful since it was our first time there.  The sides they bring you are all delicious, the salad, the rice, the cheese corn. It's ALL good.   Favorite cuts of meat were the bulgogi and the thinly sliced pork. Garlic pork wasn't too great, way fatty and not a ton of flavor. Everything else was spot on, though. If you've got a group of 4 or 6 and you're all wanting to do something a little different then the usual sushi or gastropub thing, Let's Meat is a really fun experience you'll all enjoy. And get super full.",

I went with my mom and my boyfriend and it was all actually our first time having Korean BBQ and we were very excited for the experience. They have a great selection of sides and sauces, sesame oil, chilis, tofu, daikon etc. I really enjoyed the salad they offered with spicy seasoning over it. It went perfectly to wrap up the meat in.   They have a pretty good selection of meat, the portions of the pork and brisket were way too much for me though. They should serve smaller trays of that (only because you get charged for waste). The only reason I'm docking two stars is because of our service.   Our waitress was rude to my mom and lacked decorum. She was indifferent and passed by our table maybe twice to chop up some meat for us. Other than that, we had to flag her down when we needed something.",

The wait was about 45 minutes for us, but that's more due to the amount of time it takes to actually eat here.   This is an order, cook your own food, order some more, repeat the cycle style restaurant. They have a great selection of meats to choose from and although they had several sides, we didn't eat many. The meat was the main attraction and it was awesome!  Our waiter was great at explaining everything to us and also helping us get started. We had the pork belly and the brisket to start off. Both were amazing. Then we tried the squid, bulgogi and soy chicken. Those were also very good. We ended it with some shrimp and more pork belly. The brisket was my favorite overall.   There are a variety of sauces that they bring you to go with the meats. I liked 2 out of the 4. The lettuce we ordered to go with the meats were also enjoyable. There are videos playing at the front and in the main dinning area that explain how to cook and eat the food. By the time we left, we felt like pros.   It's all you can eat, so bring your appetite!",

    "text": "**BEWARE** You have to cook your own food.Lol  With that being said. I have never been to a Korean bbq so I wasn't sure what to expect.. Overall I wish I would've waited to the hype dies down. For Saturday, it was 1.5 hrs wait. By the time I got seated I was hangry and about to die of thirst. Zah was a lot of help. He tried to explain the whats and how's but due to the music being sooo loud and I left my hearing aids at home. So It's a lost cause. Lucky my cousin took over. So here's my overall view:   FOOD: 4/5 some are good and some is a miss. The Kim Chi was a yum and I have never been a fan of those.. tofu was a nooo. I'm confuse. The curry meat was ok..  SERVICE: 5/5 Zah (waiter) and David aka manager tried to help us cook the food. But it was overwhelmingly busy so they were hoping from table to table.  AMBIANCE: 3/5 I understand it's a Saturday night. But I feel like overall cooking the meats is a good place to socialize with your friends. So with the music being sooo loud, it drown out our conversations. So we don't have a choice but to eat and nods at each other for whatever is being said and hope that's the right nod!   Special NOTE: there's a 2 hrs limit per table. From what Zah said. It's more like a courtesy thing for the next customers. You don't want to sit, eat and marinate (socialize) when there's a whole line of ppl waiting. I understand that.  But when I look at these type of set up. I wouldn't want to be rush. Cooking and socializing with friends goes together. Just my thought! So I'll keep that 2 hrs limit in mind the next time I dine here. If I want to really socialize with the girls. This place wouldn't be my choices",

We tried the chicken, shrimp, veggies and some pork options as well. All the dipping sauces and the banchan were great! And the sides were delicious - tried the egg Souffle and soup. Can not wait to return. Though a little pricey, it's well worth it. I love their policy of charging you 10% more if you over order and waste the food (since taking home the leftovers is not an option). I'm excited about this new addition to south end!

So it was different because I didn't understand the concept at first but when I heard the two phrases unlimited and two hours I said challenge accepted!   I didn't know you could get double and triple meat !!! I quickly learned how to cook the food and the service was super fast and friendly!   I truly enjoyed how the manager came by and cooked the food for us as we learned lemon wasn't used for flavor but rather cleaning the grill. I enjoyed everything from the vegetables to the triple Korean BBQ slices and more.   The options were more limited but you could get brown or white rice. I tried some green stuff that I forgot the name but was really good. Please try this place as I believe it is a lot more fun with a group of ppl between 4 and 12 people.   It is fun when everyone is laughing and enjoy good eats! Great concept and I look forward to bringing all my friends here as well.",

    "text": "A modern and clever way to do all you can eat Korean barbeque. At Let's Meat Kbbq, there is a flat rate for you to eat all your heart desires but it is structured in a way that decreases the potential for unnecessary waste. So essentially, the idea is that you order from a menu for portions of things whether it be meat, vegetables, soups, etc and if you want more, you can always order more. Honestly, some people might not be excited about the \"inconvenience\" about ordering multiple times but I'm happy with it because I've oftentimes wondered and reflected about the waste! Also, the waiters/waitresses are so attentive that anytime you need anything, they're right there to take your order. Furthermore, they do all the cooking for you, so all you need to do is eat. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the fact that the price per person is already pretty steep. It seems a little ridiculous to have to pay an additional amount for some of the meats. I won't speak much to the authenticity. I didn't particularly think the meats were flavored well though the bean paste soup was exactly as how I remember my mother making it when I was a wee lass. Lastly, I was really glad that their kimchi was good- it's the first thing I look for when I go to a Korean restaurant.",

After we were sat we were quickly greeted by Peter and he took all of the confusion away!  Not only was he very helpful in making decisions but he cooked all of the options we chose and they were delicious!  We started out simply ordering the Pork Belly and Brisket. After that we told Peter to surprise us and that he did!  The Beef Chunks are by far the best thing we had along with the traditional Bulgogi.  Great place to bring out of town friends or just something different for your dinner option.  Loved it and will return!",

The bulgogi Beef, chicken and the pork butt were all fantastic! The manager came over and spoke to us and we enjoyed everything.  We look forward to the menu expanding! Great food and service!",

The Parking \"at least when we went it was a Thursday night\" stunk cause there was none we waited for parking for about 15mins... But peeps it was like that cause this place was PACKED!!! Why? Cause people wanted to MEAT!!! Once we were seated we got a new guy he was only there for about a week and he was Excellent he taught us how to use the grill and best ways to cook the different meats, to recommending dishes and what sauces to use. So I bet the rest of the crew was on point as well. Ok ok the food is what we need to get to. EXCELLENT!!! Great choices of great quality meats and veggies awesome sauces, which were literally \"Awesome Sauce\" that's we're the word came from. And boy was I happy with every aspect that I experienced there. Worth the wait for parking and getting a table. Go Try and let me know what u taught (thought)!!!",

    "text": "So in Charlotte for my husband and I's six year anniversary. We thought we would do a nice fun day at Carowinds, and Charlotte!  Arrived a bit late to Charlotte and thought before heading to our Airbnb we would stop somewhere to do dinner. This place popped up on our yelp search and we thought we would give it a go since it had good reviews, was new, and near where we were staying. So glad we did! Absolutely no wait time which was great, and the waitress was super nice, telling us suggestions, and helping us out when she could tell we we're struggling. The price was 29.99 per person which was a bit pricy, but was basically all you could eat for two hours! We started out with pork belly and pork, with veggies and rice. It comes with like a sampler plate which had kimchi, picked radish,  potato salad, seaweed with red sauce as well as bean shoots and tons of other little sides, also had a yummy salad.  We then got bogogi, and shrimp.. by this time we were full! Our waitress gave us a hard time for tapping out early, but I think we did pretty good for two people who didn't plan on doing kbbq. Overall an awesome place for a date night, or a hangout with a group of buddies. I love kbbq it's such a fun and unique experience!!!",

I've been to many Korean BBQ restaurants in NYC and KBBQs hosted by my friends; therefore, I couldn't wait try this place out! 5 out of 6 of us came here to get a table, but we had to wait for our 6th friend to come in order for them to seat us. Keep in mind that your whole party has to be there before you can be seated. We all decided to get a bowl of white rice to have as a base with all the food we were about to order. It is $30 a person and all you can eat. If you don't finish all the food or if too much is left over, they will charge you an extra 10%... which is reasonable. Parties of 6 or more has a automatic gratuity of 15%. Your party also has a limit of 2 hours at the table. Our waiters name was Bryan, he was amazing! He had some great suggestions and we ordered everything he recommended. Ran back and forth to us because we were, indeed, needy. He still remained attentive and looked like he enjoyed serving us (even if that probably wasn't the case haha). Water was always refilled before it was empty which speaks wonders with how much I drank! Attached is a picture of our receipt. P.S. Get the beef bulgogi. We ate 12 orders of that.... SO GOOD!",

They were playing EDM that day and we love EDM! We absolutely loved Misaki, she was so knowledgeable about the menu and recommended delicious menu items! She had us try Seju (Soju in English) and it was amazing! She was so sweet and was training another waitress there named Zina (you have a good teacher Zina). Kara, the restaurant manager, frequently checked on us and we kept assuring her that everything was great! All in all, I recommend this place to anyone that loves some good korean food. I will say the only downside is not many items to choose from yet (as we were assured more items will come in the future), but definitely worth the atmosphere and customer service you receive. We will definitely be making repeat visits. Hope you all get to experience what we experienced!",

Pork, beef tips, chicken and shrimp are not that expensive and there is honestly no way a normal human being can eat $30.00 worth of food. I got a small bottle of raspberry wine which was truly disappointing. Although I should have assumed it was going to be sweet it was honestly not potable and I had to get 80% of the bottle to go. We had fun and the food was truly delicious but I do think this will be a once in a very blue moon experience considering the price.",

It has arrived and it's nothing short of greatness for that kbbq fix. All you can eat meat and sides for less than 30 bucks. The only down fall that I can say they have as of right now is not opening for lunch but it's still new so kinks are expected. Plus there's a lot of hype and excitement with it so there is gonna be a wait for a table, but it is worth the wait. If you've never had Korean bbq you are missing out on True flavor greatness. Something about cooking your meat and taking it right off the grill cooked at your own person preference  and cramming it  into your mouth one bite at a time is simply perfection lol \"caution don't burn your tongue \" all the flavors that you expect on the meat marinades and sides are all there. Let's meat kbbq did a really good job at not leaving nothing out, and doing it the right way for Charlotte. I been a vegetarian for a few months now and I broke that just for this! Welcome to Charlotte and welcome to North Carolina Korean bbq! The Home of american bbq where eastern bbq and western bbq sauce as been battling out on who's sauce is better. Sorry Carolinians KOREAN BBQ JUST WON THE TITLE! I recommend you going right at 4:30 to guarantee a table, if not, you gonna get tired of waiting for one bc they stay busy!",

My server was very nice and a few other servers I spoke to were also nice and friendly. I love the bulgogi and pork meat.

    "text": "Went here last night for their grand opening and was surprised at how authentic it is. They are located at south end of Charlotte next to their sister restaurant Seoul Food Meat Co. Parking was a little tight so you may have to do some walking which was no problem to me. They had murals with an Asian Zen and their setup was very modern with wooden benches and coffee colored marble tables with, of course, a deep stove in the middle to cook your foods. This isn't my first time having Korean BBQ so I was wondering how their setup and food would taste. It's an all you can eat $30.00 a person and $12.00 for kids ages 4-10 with a 2-hour limit. That's understandable since the place is a bit small so they don't need people hanging around when others are waiting. They have a great selection of domestic and local beers plus Korean soju! They don't have a big meat selection yet but it's KBBQ so the basics are just beef and pork, if you ever had KBBQ before. They have a variety of side dishes and I love Korean side dishes, especially kimchi and their kimchi was great! Bryan was our waiter and he was welcoming and very tentative even though they were slammed. I had a great time and ate as much as I can - I was feeling the itis after LOL. I will definitely come back and can't wait for more selections on their menu. Continue the great work guys! This will probably be a successful Korean BBQ in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Coming from California and not finding a KBBQ place in Charlotte I was really excited when this place opened. Sadly, I wasn't that impressed. If you've had KBBQ elsewhere then you'd know this place is considered mediocre. The bulgolgi was way too sweet, and the options for pork and chicken are limited. Why is the only pork option pork belly? Granted, various flavors but, still just pork belly. Even then beef options are limited. $30 is also very high for kbbq. I've eaten KBBQ in Korea towns and in upscale neighborhoods in various states and NEVER paid $30 per person. The most I've ever paid was $25 for dinner and $20 for lunch at a place that had a way better menu selection (tons of choices) and the food was amazing. And those prices were considered high! So you know $30 is ridiculous. I think they get away with charging this much because so far they're the only location Charlotte. Had it been the best KBBQ I've ever had then I honestly wouldn't have minded the price. When the food is worth the price no one minds paying. If you've never experienced KBBQ before then you may enjoy this place as your introduction into KBBQ. If you have, you won't be impressed (as other yelpers have also noted). I gave two stars because the customer service was good. But, I won't be back. Hoping another KBBQ place opens in Charlotte soon. Until then I will drive to Atlanta or fly somewhere if the craving hits me bad enough.",

There is an appeal to the all you can eat idea but we just prefer Pepero (in Stallings) and the Korean food at the counter at the Super G. Certainly the Let's Meat atmosphere is better than these two places and Let's Meat is a good place to introduce someone to Korean food. Service has been excellent at Let's Meat. The banchan are fine - nothing wrong at all. But Pepero just seems better. If you are going with a crowd and some folks are new to Korean food, I think Let's Meat is a good choice. If you already like Korean food and are less concerned about aesthetics, there are other choices.",

    "text": "I came here with a handful of friends and we all had our eyes set for Korean bbq. This place didn't disappoint. As a preface, this place was next to another Korean place and between the two restaurants there were no parking places nearby. The private lot was full, the street lots were filled at least two streets down, and it was a struggle to find anywhere that wasn't paid lots that were also rare. It wasn't necessary their fault but it also reflects how good the place was.  Regardless, the place had a modern feel when we entered and we got seated quickly once we arrived. The server we had explained the menu and offered to help us cook the foods until we got used to it, but it got rather busy so we never took him up on it. You could only order 3 meats at a time and unlimited sides, which worried me because of the size of our party made it so I didn't think we can cook and eat our fill within their 2 hour limit. Fortunately the food we requested came quickly and timely, hardly a wait as we cooked and ordered. In the end our group of 5 just hit 2 hours when we reached our fill so I'm glad about that.   We ordered essentially everything on the menu that wasn't the extra charge add on option and we came to the consensus that the beef bulgogi and beef chunks tasted the best. I personally liked the butter squid but that might not suit everyone's tastes. The beef tongue was also good as a third option but near the end of the dinner we primarily got the beef bulgogi and chunks. My friends and I agreed this place was worth the trip and money, left relatively pleased, and will most likely come again when in the area.",

I asked our server if there was any fish sauce used in any of the sauces he said he wasn't sure but he would check...after about 10min he returned to confirm that there was indeed fish sauce in one of the dipping sauces on the table but only after I asked again(I have a severe seafood allergy). The food was plentiful and fresh and I really enjoyed the ability to cook the meat yourself. They will continue to bring you food for the duration of your stay which is great. I would highly recommend trying this place out.",

Like I've seen it done on TV... cook at the table... all of that...but sadly there wasn't an option in Charlotte for me to try it out. I was STOKED when I learned of this new restaurant and immediately dragged my son to go test it out! I was not disappointed!! Our waiter was attentive, helpful and patiently taught us all the tricks (thanks Steven!). The meat was delicious. We had 2 servings of beef brisket, pork belly, garlic pork belly, squid and beef Bulgogi! The banchan was plentiful and quickly replenished. It wasn't a cheap trip, but it was definitely worth it to a newbie like me. Next time, I'll come with some grown ups so I can knock another item off my kdrama bucket list ... SOJU AND MAKGEOLLI. I'll definitely be back! What a fun place!  Oh yeah... gotta say one semi negative thing... the gyeran jjim?  (egg souffle )  not the best I've had...I was introduced to this delightful dish at a Korean restaurant in Cleveland (of all places, lol) it was sooo delicious and unique to me that I scoured the internet to learn how to make it myself. The version I prefer (and that i make) is light and fluffy. Silky, almost like custard, but not pudding-y, with almost no broth.  Theirs was like soft scrambled eggs in chicken soup. The flavor was good, it was definitely tasty, but it wasn't what I was looking forward to. All said, this is DEFINITELY a place you want to try out!! Loved it!!!",

However, we went with 8 people; we told the host we would prefer to sit together as we had seen multiple tables with two areas to cook. We ended up sitting at two separate tables and when we asked if could wait to sit together, we were told \"either sit here or nothing, those are saved\". Needless to say, it threw us and we sat. We had two different servers and no option to mingle. The food was good and the staff was efficient but you can tell they are not working for their money and just going through the motions. Semi-rude and with a set price, our server seem to just expect a certain amount. We ordered alcohol and extras but that didn't seem to change their mindset. Overall, I probably would go back, firm believer in second and maybe third changes, but it would be with a small group and now my expectations are lower so there is less room for disappointment.",

Our table stayed cleared of unused dishes, she came by and made sure our grill was fine and that our drinks was filled. Since it was my first time, she recommended foods for me to try. I've ordered the pork belly, spicy chicken, ribeyed steak, I loved the spicy chicken and ribeye. They were seasoned so well. I sampled all the sides, and enjoyed the kimchi the most. My sidekick enjoyed his meal and tried to do the cooking. Fortunately, I know how to cook, unlike him, so I made sure our food wasn't over or undercooked. I would love to come back and try everything else.",

Located right beside Seoul Kitchen which is our usual go-to when visiting this city, I was very excited to know Let's Meat has finally opened since my pervious visit. We arrived around 5:30-6 p.m.  and there was zero wait which is the norm for Korean BBQ places, peak time like 7 p.m. is the time to beat when dining at an AYCE. The hostess was very pleasant and sat our party rather quickly.   The menu was standard with items that I've seen in other menus before but the flavor of the meats were out of this world! It seems like they took their time marinating them before serving. I was a fan of the minimal portion size, it gave us a chance to try almost everything on the menu. Variety of options for the banchan (sides) the one that stuck out for the the most were the bean sprouts, tofu, and kimchi. The potato salad tasted a little bland and could use more flavor. I was a fan of the corn cheese as well!   Our server was very attentive and had great energy. The place itself was good in size and had plenty of seating. The price was a bit high but worth it for the pleasant experience I had. I will definitely be back here when I'm back in Charlotte!",

She got us to try the pork bellies and other meats in the menu. I also like how you everyone that works here are in tandem as far as getting more side dishes and refilling our beverages. I wish they have more of them up here.  So, overall the food was great, all you can eat and its bang for your buck.  The atmosphere is definitely nice, but a bit louder and I don't mind it at all.

On top of that, I always grab the button mushroom, cheese corn, and bulgogi.  Remember... it's ALL YOU CAN EAT!!  The service here is always top notch! The servers and staff ( Misaki, David, Prenny, Bobby, Peter, Dylan... just to name a few) are absolutely amazing! They are so attentive and always keep my water full!

    "text": "Wow! My review is officially #102!  The scene: it's Saturday afternoon and we're tired of waiting for a table at Seoul Food Meat Co. right next door.  I sneak out and call Let's Meat - \"We have a table but you need to come right now.\"  Me: \"Done and done\", as I trot thorough the door. I felt like I had won the lottery because I've heard the wait times can be longggg.  Since there have been 101 hundred reviews, I'm going to give you the Yelp Cliff Notes.  1) This place is a lot of fun - great place for groups and/or a celebration  2) The food is really good - the meats/proteins are high quality - the banchan (Koreans sides are awesome)  3) Adults $30 per person - kids 4-10 $12 - there's a two hour limit but that's plenty of time  4) The staff are great - super quick on the draw - they use headsets to speed orders along and to communicate with each other  5) They will bring you three meats/proteins at a time - and bring you more and more - ALL YOU CAN EAT (but not waste)  6) They serve Beer but it's on the pricey side  $5-10 range for bottles/cans  7) The small print at the bottom of the menu = for parties of 6 or more there will be an 18% service charge  We had a blast (even though we did have to cook our own food) - they even cleaned our grill and replaced it with another at one point. Super cool place!",

I've always had to travel further for this, so it's wonderful that we finally have one closer.  The first round of meats that we ordered was pork belly, bugolgi, and squid. The portions are small; one strip of pork belly and a small cup of squid. I know it's all you can eat, but it was pretty much one bite a piece until we ordered the next round. My brother in law mentioned to the server that we'd like more at one time, and he hooked us up. If it was two or three people at the table, it would have been different, and enough. So they stayed laying out the meats. So good and delic!! Full of flavor and the stone top grilled it perfectly.  It did take a while for each session to cook.. not sure if the gas was going out on the grill top or if the burner wasn't getting hot. The server had to keep messing with it. Other than that, our server, Green, was very wonderful!",

    "text": "So my boyfriend and I decided to stop by Let's Meat for our first try at Korean BBQ! While there is a 2 hour limit with their all you can eat meats/sides, you can still do a lot of damage in that time frame. From the pork belly to the ribeye all of the meats were delicious and top quality. As for sides I was pretty #basic and stuck with white rice and veggies while my boyfriend got the egg souffle and cheesy corn.  My only issue was that our waiter did not let us do the one thing you would expect a Korean BBQ spot let you do - COOK YOUR OWN FOOD! Every time that the meats came to the table she would pop up and throw them on the grill for us. At first I thought that she would just do this for the first meat to show us the ropes, but she continuously came by every few minutes to flip the meat for us. Eventually I grabbed the tongs before she had the chance to and when she came to the table she reached for them anyway. After the 4th or so serving of meat, I asked if it would be alright if we cooked it ourselves. She said \"ok\" and let me start to cook the meat, but still came back a few minuets later and took the tongs to flip it some more. It was annoying, but I was not in the mood to get into a tug-of-war over a pair of tongs lol.   So overall the food was great, but we didn't get to have the experience that we came for. Looking at her with other tables she did the same thing while other waiters were more laid back. I heard one waiter specifically say \"I'm just here if you need any help, but cooking it on your own is a part of the experience!\" I wish that our waiter had gotten that memo...",

    "text": "For those of you who are looking for an amazing Korean meal, Let's Meat Kbbq is your place! Let's Meat is an All You Eat Korean Feast with all the staples including Bulgogi, Pork Belly, Beef Tongue, Kimchi and so much more.  Along with the meat selection they have a variety of vegetables, like King Oyster Mushrooms, Squash and Onions.  Upon arriving on a Wednesday night for a birthday dinner we were lucky to be immediately seated.  Within just a few minutes, a variety of starters and dipping sauces were delivered and our waitress greeted us with a smile and took our drink order.  The starters included tastings of Kimchi, Noodle Salad, Daikon Radishes, Asian Long Beans and a few other tasty treats. After looking at the menu, and learning you could order three meats at one time and all the vegetables and randoms, we started with the Bulgogi, Shrimp and Spicy Chicken, White Rice, Bone Broth and some vegetables.  With the large group we had we were brought two orders each, thank you to the waitress for knowing the food would go fast.  Having never been the waitress cooked our first round, explaining the timing around each meat as well as the process of cutting into strips...with scissors. Everything was good, but I have to say the Bulgogi and Shrimp stood out for me.  Next round, Beef Tongue, Ribeye Steak and Squid. All I will say is you must try the Beef Tongue! It is sliced paper thin and once placed on the grill cooks pretty quickly and was so fresh, we ended up ordering another round.  In addition to the second round of Beef Tongue we topped off the meal with Button Mushrooms and the Corn Cheese.  Another must try.  Allow the Cheese to heat up and stuff the cooked mushrooms with the Corn Cheese and take a bite, heaven.  Overall, I am not typically a Korean lover, but I enjoyed everything I ate.  In addition, the service was phenomenal and I think it is a great place to enjoy with a group of friends.  So, if you are like me, give it a shot and you will not be disappointed.",

I think it's personally overpriced for the quality of meat you get and the types of bonchon but I'm use to this type of food so I'm being more strict , and eat Korean bbq alot.  I gave it 4 stars bc the service was great and fast, they had many workers attending to the tables . If you have kids, come during the day bc I can easily see this being a crowded spot for adults at night. Parking is horrible.   Only suggestions I would make is explain the sauces and bonchon to those that arent familiar with Korean bbq in detail. Make your cheese corn larger with better cheese.  Peel the shrimp and add salt and pepper, get some regular soy sauce on the table for kids .",

However, unless you want to 1) drive to Georgia or 2) cook AND clean a kbbq set-up at home, this is really the only place that you can get your kbbq fixing in Charlotte.    I've only been here once and was not impressed with the quality of meats that were served. The marination of the meats was all too sweet in my opinion, and the marinated meat itself seemed as though they were a few days too old. The plain meats were fine, but unfortunately, you can get better cuts in GA or buy it yourself at a similar price.    All-in-all, the place isn't terrible and the service was good. It's just not my kind of place.   I care a lot about the money value to food quality, and so I've found that I can best utilize those values when I cook kbbq at home instead.",

    "text": "So this was my first time coming to let's meat! We went on a Sunday night around 6 o'clock and were seated at 6:30. From the reviews and people that have been here, expect to wait. We had a party of 8, and even though we were seated near each other, it wasn't at the same table and both tables had two different servers. Our server was David T. who was very efficient and brought out stuff very quickly. On the other hand, the other table had a women server with half of her head shaved on the side, and our friends were telling us that she was much slower and were forgetting things that they were ordering. So you'll have a different experience by the type of server you'll have. The meat quality is very delicious. The briskets has that perfect marbling, and the pork belly just melts in your mouth. If cooked right, the rib eye steak can be very mouthwatering, but the cuts are very thin and small, so you have to keep an eye on them so they don't overcook. The cheese corn, and egg souffle was really good. But the Bibimbap or \"bap bibim\" was very saucy as well as the cold noodles. The bone broth is very light but you would have to add salt and pepper to your liking. The oyster king mushrooms are very delicious and I'm not really into mushrooms either.  Our server David mentioned that if we followed their Instagram page and posted a picture on Facebook we would get a dollar discount. It would also count to others who would do it in our party. For example, he said if all eight of us posted or followed the Instagram, we would all get eight dollars off.  Only the manager was able to look at our phones and put it on our receipts. So can you tell me about False advertising, that seven of us did it but we only got 72 cents off? It wasn't even a dollar, and it sounds like it's a big deal, but I mean they lied.... anyway food is good, give it a try,I just got a bad taste in my mouth with the lying advertisement. Also the music is very very loud with 2000s r&b and pop music.",

    "text": "Let's Meat Kbbq is the best place for a fun & tasty experience. I have recently become a huge fan of Korean BBQ places and this has to be top on my list of favorites. We have never been to a place like this before.   Let's Meat is an all you can eat restaurant where you cook in front of yourselves. BE PREPARED TO EAT! Sometimes it scares people to think they have to cook on their own but... Don't worry there are people there to help you along the way!  When you arrive the wait staff will bring out starters/sides like Kimchi, Daikon Radishes, Asian Long Beans and more; along with dipping sauces. Then they will ask you to order your meats/sides. I suggest going in with an open mind and trying everything you can. When I first went I had no idea what half of the food items were, but left loving more than I thought. They offer meat from Bulgogi and Pork Belly to Beef Tongue and Shrimp. They give you rice, but you can also ask for lettuce wraps, which I loved because I could add the meat and some of the starters to it and eat it like a healthy taco. *Side note: I suggest getting the already marinated meats because it makes life easier if you aren't experienced.   My boyfriend and I went together and had a blast. Many people there with us had groups of 4-6. It's a great place for groups, so you can all take turns cooking and eating. Try going at low-traffic times so you don't feel rushed and can just relax and enjoy. They do have a 2 hour limit to the dinning experience, but it does get busy pretty fast!   Overall, Let's Meat is such a fun experience to do for a date night or with a group of people. It is reasonably priced for the amount you eat and experience. It definitely is an experience you won't want to miss. Can't wait to go back next!",

I personally went on a Friday evening with a large group of people, early so that we wouldn't have a crazy wait time as its been noted in other reviews. I appreciated that they had a refrigerator with beer and limited wines which you can enjoy while you wait. The menu is very to the point but seems so similar in the choices of meat, that makes it hard to choose but I am a meat lover so I was there to try it all. Our server was particularly great at explaining how it worked and demonstrated how to properly cook certain meats, specifically the pork. Cutting up the meat made it more ideal to not only cook but then share once its been cooked through. There are a ton of side items and hard to figure out which you want to eat with what and then the sauces. I took the approach to try a little of everything. The decor was a large attempt in minimalist and again to the point, nothing to run home about. Very friendly service, food was good but I am not sure I am in a rush to go back. Did it, done it, I am good. Sorry, so much interaction and stimulation overload, pictures were not in favor.",

This was one of the best meals I have had in Charlotte in the 20 months I have been coming here for work.  We had most everything on the menu and everything was excellent.  The soy chicken was the best chicken dish and the bulgogi was so good it would turn a vegetarian if they try it.  I LIKE Seoul Food Meat Company, I am in love with Let's Meat Kbbq and will definitely be adding it to the regular rotation and bring a bigger crowd from work next time.",

Initially we were told two hours, thats fine.  There was multiple instances where we could have all sat together but the young kids doing the seating do not know how to hold tables correctly.  There is a two hour time limit on eating here and the staff continued to feed the other table we were waiting on.  The blonde girl who works at the front told my wife for over an hour the table was almost done... which was a lie.  Half of our group was almost done eating by the time we got seated.  I expressed my feelings to the host and didn't even get an I'm sorry.  So much for a nice bday dinner for my wife.",

The host were very nice and the waiters were extremely helpful, especially my homies, Carl and Peter. They did a great job of explaining the menu and the whole concept of the restaurant. We started off with some basic meats and later diverged into more random meals. I would greatly recommend anything with beef or pork. All of them were greatly sliced and helped cooked to perfection. The chicken was ehhh. Nothing special just soda normal chicken but not much flavor. The shrimp was underwhelming. A big part that I really enjoyed was both the cow tongue and the buttery squid. The way it was cooked was enjoyable and the end product was pretty good. ALSO THE CORN CHESSE WAS AMAZING! I must've have 5 bowls of it since it was so creamy and delicious. I would greatly recommend this place for a special event and also have 24 hour notice before attending to have space for everything.",

Take one star out as the selection and taste are not as good as expected, or at least not as good as what a $30-$40 meal should be. Not marinated meat are cut thinly and marinated meat are mini portion and often too sweet. You have to pay extra $14 if you want to have Kalbi.  Service is good, environment is good and clean, a little too loud for me though. There wasn't a wait when we were there on Sunday after 9pm. I would suggest the restaurant to increase their variety of the selections in the menu and possibly take off the extra $$ meat.",

They will not seat you until everybody arrives. Once you are sitting at the table, you will be able to order 3 meats at a time. They will also tell you that you can cook the food yourself. Now we cooked some of it but we had sever cook most of it because I was like, why am I paying $30 to cook my own food. Do not order more meat than you think you'll be able to eat, because any uncooked meat left, they will add a 10% surcharge to your bill. You can't take any food with you. You'll have two hours to eat, so pace yourself.  In the end, we enjoyed ourselves, and the food was good. The egg souffle is an must try. I mixed my egg souffle with my rice, and also added some of the meats and shrimp.  The miso soup was good as well. It was a little spicy, which I like.  This place will make a perfect spot for a first date because it will allow you to talk with your date while your food is cooking right in front of you.",

And the sauces needed refills frequently.   Tried some varieties of pork belly. For people who love pork belly, they won't be disappointing. I'm just not a pork belly person.   Loved these Ban Chan (small plates of appetizers): kimchi, potato salad, pickled daikon radish (to go with meats and lettuce leaves)  Only downside: it's so popular that you have to go before 6 to avoid ridiculously long waiting time on the weekdays, and before 4:15 on the weekends (yes, wait in line even before it opens)  Updated on 7/17: The menu has expanded! (See picture)  Tried these new items:     - butter squid: good!     - ribeye: good!     - kimchi noodle soup (cold): not a big fan     - shrimp: good!     - pork belly: original, lemon garlic, garlic and spicy flavors. Like them more than before!      - spicy chicken: good!  Waiting time: recently went on a Sunday and a Tuesday around 5:30. Tuesday: No line during the time while we were there.

I guess nothing stops ppl from eating KBBQ because it literally looked like a hurricane outside from a storm before we went there and there was still an hour wait for a table.   I had done KBBQ before in other cities  but not like that at Let's Meat. A few of the menu items were foreign to me like the egg souffle, the corn cheese and the beef tongue.  I think my favorite items were the squid, the beef bulgogi and the ribeye. They all had so much flavor and worked well with several of the dipping sauce options. The ribeye was actually magical. I have never had anything like it before.  I wish there was more of a description for some of the Bon Chons. My friend had never done KBBQ before was very curious of some of the items and would not try them because she didn't know what they were and wouldn't ask.  Overall the experience was phenomenal. I think the price is fair and who can turn down such a cool atmosphere and KPOP playing in the background.   Let's Meat KBBQ  1400 S Church St, Ste B,  Charlotte, NC 28203 May 4, 2019 6pm",

We called ahead to see if a la carte was possible and to confirm the two items on the menu. Not only was a la carte not possible, but the host also did not inform us that it would be and additional $14 per order of galbi. For reference, a single order of galbi is meant to serve only a single person. So in order for two people two split more than a meager single serving of galbi, the price would be $90.   At other fine dining Korean restaurants, $90 can go a long way to serve the most premium of beef. All you can eat is already known to serve a far lesser quality of meat in order to compensate for profit. So in conjunction with (1) not a single Korean or even Asian person dining which is a sign that it is not authentic, (2) the host did not inform us correctly of the menu and made us drive out of our way, and (3) the servers were very inexperienced and admitted to not really cooking the food for the customer and telling the customer it's \"part of the experience\" which is really offensive, we decided not to eat here.    Looks like a lot of people like it here probably because it caters to the demographic, but if you're from out of town and craving Korean bbq as a native, definitely don't come here!  We're giving four stars despite the bad experience to support the local business.",

Overall this is the closest KBBQ AYCE for about 300 miles and the only one in the area. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. The food limited from normal menus but the side dishes were abundant and the meat was good. The quality of the meat here was a highlight and although the selection was not expansive it was good. Overall a very good experience and great place to come and hang out with friends.",

We went today with a large group (8 people) and didn't have to wait long for a table, which at 12:00 on a Sunday you never really know how long it'll be.  We were seated and greeted by our server named David, who was great.  He gave us a brief rundown of the menu, and we placed our orders.    We started with the pork belly, and did many orders of that, the beef bulgogi, the ribeye steak and the shrimp.  All of the meats and sauces were absolutely excellent.   You should know that when you go here (as with many Korean BBQ's,\" you cook the food yourself using the grill in the center of the table and should be comfortable with this going in.    The kimchi and sides they bring for the table pair very well with the meats, and everything brings with it a very complementary flavor.  We were reminded by David that we would be charged for any additional food left over, but rest assured we ate every bite.    It's not a cheap tab ($30 per person for all you can eat,) but well worth it for a treat with a large group.  I would definitely go again.",

Our waiter was super friendly & engaged in conversation with us. He was very thorough with the menu & I felt comfortable with the dining experience because of his assistance.   I don't eat beef or pork but there are seafood and chicken options. If you don't eat meat at all, mushrooms can serve as the protein. The spicy chicken was my favorite & so was the corn and cheese! I got brown rice; it's the sticky kind which was great. They bring out a variety of sauces that you can use for your meat or to use with your rice. I taste tested all of the sauces and they will specifically bring out the sauces you want if you don't want the others. The salad with the house dressing was really good too.   It was perfect timing whenever he would come back to our table asking if we wanted more. I will definitely be back.",

On a Thursday night, the place was jamming with great tunes and every table was filled.   The two hour time limit is really no problem, the time goes fast and it doesn't feel rushed.   Actually, the overall experience is sold FIVE star!!!!!  THREE star for value.........One of my good friends is hard core Korean, like off the boat Korean.  We have been to Atlanta a dozen times.   He knows all the mom and pop Korean holes in the wall.   My major issue with this place is the up-charge for the Galbi/Kalbim it is ridiculous.  Furthermore, comparing to other KBBQ I have been too, ummm, around 10 in the last year, all over the USA - this spot has a very limited menu.   Typical of KBBQ, for the same price, but the menu options offer 30-40 varieties.   Like I said, the up-charge really bummed me out, had I known that, I would have skipped this place.   What is offered is excellent and what you would expect from a KBBQ.   I have no problem with the items on the menu, all excellent ---- just the lack of items.    The sides are equally excellent.    If you have never experienced KBBQ, this place should be on your foodie list.  It is a great time and ultra fun to cook your own food.   Don't be intimidated by the method, just jump in or ask a server for help and they will guide you through the process.    Also, if your server is doing everything for you, just tell them that you got it........  They are respectful and not overbearing.",

However coming in for the first time it seems extremely overwhelming. The general concept is you play one set price you can get as many meets as possible. It is nice having the assistant they are to clean off the stove and help guide you along the way. The goal is to be there and eat as much as you want without exceeding your two hour limit.  I fell in love with the bulgogi! I imagine everyone else will as well, what I do when I clicked it is I added pieces of garlic and cooked it all together and it was amazing. We didn't leave with the meat sweats because we also have some of their delicious sides on the side. I would highly recommend cooking the shrimp and seasoning it as well. But it's fun bring a group of friends and have a great moment.",

Still, I always recommend if you can plan ahead.  Service was kind and efficient and they gladly brought out whatever we needed in a timely way.  Having said that, I found the meat to be fatty for me, and the accompaniments weren't that great.  They gave us a corn and cheese casserole for one of our sides that tasted like can corned sprinkled with cheese.  Also, the meat really stuck to our grill so bad they had to get us another.    It was fun, we had an enjoyable time, but we were hungry later.  I likely won't be back, but know that many there seemed to really enjoy.",

We've been to KBBQ's in other towns but it was our first one in Charlotte. I really liked how he took the time to explain each step to us and his personal recommendations. The meat was amazing and their dipping sauce is scrumptious. Tons of side dishes and it was nice to experiment with all of them. The soju came in a cute gold pot and we got the peach drink to mix it in with, thanks to Vien's recommendation. The cooking area is a little smaller than the other KBBQ's we've been to but I actually like it this way, perfect to enjoy the small portions. Follow them on IG! Apparently if they get 10,000 followers they'll lower the lunch price (according to signs all over the restaurant). I will definitely be returning here!",

    "text": "If I had the choice of driving to Charlotte for kbbq or Atlanta, I'd probably still choose Atlanta. However, this place was still pretty good. The pork belly was tender, but the beef brisket wasn't sliced thin enough to be tender, so it was hit or miss. The one thing I really like was that they have a lot of dipping sauces to change up the flavor of the meats. Probably the biggest disappointment was the salad. It just tasted like lettuce with sesame oil. Overall, if I was in Charlotte and craving some kbbq, this would be the best option, but only because it's the only option.",

Although, there was a slight struggle in the beginning I felt like a pro chef by the end of the meal. The servers were more than helpful with explaining everything on the menu including how to cook the food throughout the complete dining experience. All of the meats were fresh with addition to having a great selection of sides. Im not a pork eater, but the other meat selections when cooked were delicious.  Expect a wait time upon arrival, I believe thats the only downfall but because there's a min 2hr dining time I can understand it. I will definitely be returning!  Try the rice wine!",

They have a ll the basics as well as some specialties such as pork belly marinated with different sauces/spices. They also have galbi, but it's at an additional cost which kind of sucks... Also, the portions they give the meat at are kind of small, but I get that they're trying to reduce food waste. The great service makes up for it though, as we ordered all that we wanted without waiting much.  It's all-you-can-eat only so be weary of that. If you're in Charlotte and you're hungry, definitely check this place out.",

Our server Alexandria was wonderful and attentive and so was the rest of the staff! My family and I will definitely be coming back as often as we can! It was such a fun and authentic experience grilling your own meats and vegetables! Definitely get there early so you won't have to wait long! Loved the pork belly, corn cheese, beef tongue was amazing and the beef chucks were definitely my favorite!!! I didn't take any pictures of the meat on the grill because I was wayyyyy to excited and busy enjoying the great food! The sides were awesome delicious! Awesome kimchi, salad, pickled veggies and a great selection of sauces! If you love Korean food come to Let's Meat, it is definitely going to be one of Charlotte's best restaurants!",

The seasoning the and meat is just delicious, you have many option to choose from.  I am a brisket fan so most would have to choose for themselves, my mom and stepfather loved the bulgogi, as well as my son, the soy chicken was great!  My suggestion is to try everything, because that is what being a foodie is about.  By the way try and hope that you get Brittney as a waitress, she is very knowledgeable and awesome!!!  Also, you are greeted with a smile from everyone, it kind of feels like a chick fil a experience!!  Please try this place and forget about the cost!!!",

    "text": "I had some friends in town from Philadelphia who were in the mood for Korean BBQ.  Being vegan, I wasn't too thrilled about it, but I took one for the team and went along for the ride.  I figured worst case scenario I could munch on mushrooms, kimchi, and rice.  We were seated and ordered rounds of soju and beer and everything was going scrumtralescently.  Then it happened.  The meats arrived.  I had Vietnam flashbacks.   My pupils dilated.  I tried my best to think happy thoughts, but once my friends put the meat on the grill, the most overwhelmingly insatiable desire to take part in the meat-eating overtook me.  I thought back on all the animals I hadn't eaten over the past few years.  I looked at the meat searing on the grill.  I looked up, hoping god would intervene.  There was no god.  I took my chopsticks and went for a piece of beef tongue on the grill.  The conversation my friends were having was no more.  All eyes were on me.  I grasped the beef tongue between my sticks, dipped it in some garlic chili sauce, and brought it to my mouth.  \"This is the moment of truth,\" everyone was thinking.  I deposited it in my oral orifice.  My taste buds celebrated the long forgotten taste of meat the way the Cubs fans did when they won the series after 100 years.  It was like every episode of Shokugeki no Soma combined.  Dopamine flooded my brain.  I had a massive erection.  I experienced the most intense euphoria of my life.  This was the meat injection that would satisfy any trainspotter.  After I was done chewing and swallowed, the silence that had blanketed the table was replaced by the loud roar of not only my friends cheering, but the adjacent tables and nearby employees cheering as well.  I felt like I had just single-handedly defeated the 3rd reich.  One kind stranger bought soju for our entire table and made a toast in my honor.  I gorged on delicious meats throughout the night.  I had never been so happy.  Thank you, Let's Meat, for showing me the light.  I shall return.",

Price is a bit more expensive than I'm used to ($30) but I think the service makes up for it.

Service was seamless and we were attended by no less than 8 staff members!  We literally wanted for nothing! Good variety of meats making Let's Meat a definite must eat.    When to get there= EARLY!!! (opens at 430 and fills up quickly) Where to wait= their sister restaurant on the same property has a nice patio bar and they'll call you when your table is ready. What to order= Lemon Pork belly & Bulgogi act as co-stars of the show.  Don't forget to order a few sides of veggies...  I find it best to place the veggies around the perimeter of the grill, place a few pieces of pork belly near the center;  allowing them to crackle, smoke and sear accordingly- the beautiful juices flow down onto the veggies & help cook them.",

Usually at ayce kbbq places the steam egg is funky and watery and weird, but this place is different and the steam egg is smooth and creamy without smelling weird and being watery. I love the brisket here. In my opinion, brisket is the staple of ayce kbbq and if your brisket is good quality, then you've basically nailed the kbbq business. I love the garlic lemon pepper pork belly. They have so many meat options for their ayce and I think it's so worthy for the price. Of course you can go to more Korean-cultured cities and find cheaper ayce kbbq, but the quality is another question. The quality and price at Let's Meat is a good deal to me. However, the only thing I don't like about this place is the side dishes. They're very mediocre at best. I would like to see better kimchi and sprouts.",

We sat down at a table with a small grill in the center and felt a little overwhelmed. I had eaten Korean BBQ before but never the tradition grill-your-own meat type of place. Our server quickly realized we didn't know what to do and helped us get started. You can order 3 meats at a time - several times of pork belly and other pork, some cuts of beef, some chicken, seafood and a few other options. After our first round, we started to get a hang of it and wanted to try everything the menu had to offer.   It was unanimous at our table, bulgogi is delicious in general but it's even better when you grill it yourself at. your table. Mix it with a really cool atmosphere and a dining an exciting dining experience that is unique in the Charlotte area and you've got yourself an easy 5 star night out",

We ordered almost everything off the menu and requested more sides as well. They were definitely not stingy on the amount of meat they gave you or the amount of times you could order sides either. Our server had our grill switched out about 3x just to keep our food from burning from each different flavor of sauce, they were definitely on top of that. Linda checked on us every so often to make sure we were still enjoying everything. I couldn't have asked for a better server! We will be coming again and definitely requesting her again!",

    "text": "Great. I am excited to see what other meats will join the menu as they grow. The wait was long but worth it. I wasn't greeted when I came in and I had to figure out on my own that there is a list up front with an eraseable marker to write my name and phone number on. I didn't find this method very effective and hope they find a more efficient one. I would recommend arriving at a decent time. At a certain point they have to cut off any other customers that come in due to the nature of the restaurant offering all you can eat for 2 hours.  The dipping sauces were good. The house sauce is the best. Then you have sesame oil and hot dipping sauce and paste. A large variety of sides included. I tried all of the beef, pork belly, and chicken. We also got the kalbi which is extra. It was so tasty that we considered it the dessert for the night.  Generous portions as well as all you can eat sides. We got an extremely nice waitress. Since we were one of the last people sat, she gave us a lot of attention and cooked our meats for us since we were her only table. Traditionally you are supposed to cook your own meat so they may not do this on a busier night.  Overall it was a decent experience. I'd like to see some Kobe or wagyu added to make things even more interesting. The atmosphere was a little loud as large parties were drinking. The music was a little out of place since it was almost like electronic or club music. Something more traditional would add to the experience.",

The sauces that you get on the side for the meats are very tasty and of different flavors; all ranging from sweet to spicy. There is a wide variety of meat to select from, so if you're not into beef or pork like I am, there's chicken and seafood; however, the chicken does take awhile to cook thoroughly. If you're vegetarian, don't worry. They got you too! There are veggies- all fresh and super tasty on the grill.  The staff is super friendly and all very patient. I have no complaints. Our waiter was awesome! He was very funny and extremely friendly. I really appreciated the fact that he frequently came by to check our table and asked if we needed anything because I was with one heck of group; we kept asking for more every time he came by-- the food was THAT good.

And because this place is an all you can eat Korean bbq restaurant, you are handed the menu, with everything from beef brisket to shrimp to bulgogi to marinated chicken. The menu has a large variety of other options such as leaf wraps, white/brown rice, tofu, and cold noodles.   It is the only all you can eat Korean bbq in North Carolina.",

    "text": "I took my fiance here last night for his birthday dinner and it was absolutely amazing! Unfortunately we didn't plan well - and since we went on a Saturday night and they don't take reservations so we ended up waiting almost 2 hours for a table. I typically wouldn't wait this long, but our friends told us how amazing it is. So we waited and went next door to grab a drink. As soon as we were seated our waiter was there to explain the process and answer any and all of our questions. We were able to order 3 meats at a time and unlimited sides and vegetables. The food came out within minutes and we were able to start cooking. Our waiter came back to our table multiple times throughout the night and we never felt like we were waiting for him to explain something or bring over more food - if anything we had too much food! The star of the night is the beef bulgogi. We loved it so much we ordered it twice! We also tried the squid which I didn't love (seeing tentacles freaks me out a bit) but my fiance liked it. We also tried the tongue which I told the waiter I probably wouldn't try - I was imagining a full giant tongue to come out, but to my surprise it was thinly sliced meat that didn't resemble a tongue at all. Once cooked it tasted similar to meat you would get on a cheesesteak. It wasn't amazing, but I'm glad I took the opportunity to try something new. Overall we loved everything about this place (except the wait)! While we were sitting there we were already planning on bringing our friends back here with us. My only hope is that in the future they start to take reservations or use the no wait app.",

It's all you can eat y'all..!for 2 hours!!! Growing up with Korean BBQ everywhere I vouch... this is the real thing.   Ask for Nate; he's the best server they have. Yes you CAN cook but he will cook for you (all severs will) to give you a break. I personally like to cook and my girls Love to \"help.\" Nate insisted that he help out because I \"need to eat too.\" His words exactly.   Don't shy away from the non-Marinated meats either. Pour some Galbi sauce on there and drop a few cloves of garlic and BAM... Insert whatever sound/face you make when something tastes good!!!! That Ribeye and Bulgogi though... best meats on the menu.   The egg souffle, green beans and corn cheese are legit too.   Everyone is talking about it. Take her. Try it. I was seated right away.

    "text": "I've been dying to try this place out and it finally happened. I've read so many reviews and have friends saying good things about this place that I had to check it out. The wait is kind long so my husband and I decided to go early.  We got there around 6:30 and were advise the wait would take around 45 minutes. I was wondering how long the wait is if you get there around 7:30ish??? Probably over an hour but I can tell you in advance that it is totally worth it! The good thing is they get your number and call when your table is ready so you don't have to wait there.  In the waiting area they have a big screen that explain how everything works and it is pretty easy actually.  Our table was ready for us around 30 minutes after our arrival.  Our waiter Zach was really nice and helpful. He explain how everything worked and made suggestions about the menu.  I had a Korean grape juice that was delicious and we had many different kinds of meat that night.  Our favorite was beef brisket! The place was clean, the service was really good, the food did not take long to get to us and is all you can eat, so if you love good food like us this is the place for you!  They have a two hour limit once you order but you will be done probably before that. Love the place, love the food. Can't wait to go back! !!!",

    "text": "So it looks like Charlotte finally got Korean BBQ, and it's about time.  If you have no idea what KBBQ is, it's basically a hot pot but for grilled meat. If you don't know what Hot Pot is, think of a do it yourself BBQ. When I'm talking about DIY BBQ, I mean, they give you raw meat and you put it on the grill and you bbq for yourself. I think Let's Meat is actually doing it right in a new market though. However saying that, I do think that there are some things that they still have to iron out.  First up, getting seated. We're standing in line waiting for a table, and we know that we have 2 people coming along however we're already there and want to sit down. Instead of waiting for the whole party to be there, let us get seated, because what if the tables fill up? I get it, the 2-hour time limit once you sit down starts as soon as we get seated and it wouldn't be fair for those who come along after. I can see that if it gets really busy and there's only one person with a party of 6, yeah okay, I guess because the restaurant wants to maximize profits. But, if a majority of the party shows up why can't they sit? Start the time, and kick them out at 2 hours whether or not all of them are there or not, it's not the staff's fault for their party not being there on time. Plus, the BBQ portion still takes time to cook anyways so that gives it more reason to just seat those that are there already.  I do think that the staff is doing an excellent job on educating people on what KBBQ is. Especially in this market, there are those that have no idea what it is and could feel intimidated especially coming from an environment when everything is already done when served. I thought our waiter was amazing at explaining and demonstrating how to cook/kbbq. Even though he didn't need to, I think he was in the mode of explaining so I just let him do his script that he basically came up with from serving X amount of tables.   **When ordering: PORK BELLY IS 1 PIECE per ORDER.** My experiences in KBBQ usually 1 order is like 3 pieces or sometimes 4. However, Let's Meat speaks a different language. One order of let's say pork belly, means literally, one piece. So if you're thinking oh, let's get X amount of pork belly, just order the amount. For beef brisket, it's really thin so don't feel bad for thinking you're \"over ordering.\"  I think that didn't come out until I ordered. If I would have known I would've ordered 5-6 orders of pork belly from the start.  Sauces: Let's Meat comes up a little short on this. We asked simply for some soy sauce to dip our meat into, and the staff responded that they didn't have any. But, when they served the side dishes, guess what one of those dishes had? Yeah, soy sauce. So, if you don't have any soy sauce, how? So, if you're looking to want to dip your meats into something, I would definitely recommend you to bring your own sauce in. They don't judge or say you can't, so that's definitely a tip on that end. Now, please don't bring in like A1 or Ketchup to dip your KBBQ meat in, I'm talking on the realm of fish sauce, or chili sauce that you want to dip.  Alcoholic Beverages: Let's Meat has them. If you've never had flavored Soju...you're in for a treat if you go down that route. Just drink responsibly, because most likely you won't know what hit you until you stand up.  Time Limit: 2 hours is technically plenty of time to eat. If you're worried about that, order more at the beginning so you have it cooking. However, this is one limitation that affected me because even though I know 2 hours is plenty of time, it still gives me anxiety when I'm eating and I just don't like that feeling. In my experience at other KBBQ restaurants, I don't really think about time and in the back of my mind repeating: \"We have to eat faster and order more or they'll kick us out!\" I know we were done within the 2 hours, but still I think this would be my biggest hesitation on coming here to eat again.  Overall: Let's Meat isn't bad. The price point of $29.99 per person, and depending on what you order it could be more. We ordered the Kalbi, because I mean, that's what you should get, at least to try out. If you don't know what it is, let's just say it's on the sweet side, but it's really tasty and can become dangerous to increasing that bill. Still if you've never had it, it's something to get. I would definitely come back when the market of KBBQ settles down a bit. But if you have never been here and you want to know what the hype is about, go for it because it's not 4 hours away like it used to be when I grew up and lived in Charlotte.",

The seafood options are on point, and the squid is extremely fresh. My family loved the squid and we ordered multiple rounds. Their marination for the beef still amazes me, as it is so well seasoned. I wish some of the pork belly options had a more strong flavor from the marination. It's very subtle and a stronger sense of flavor would be awesome.   I can't wait to see what new options they'll be adding to their menu! A spicy squid option would be pretty dank... Whatever they choose to add, I'm sure it won't disappoint!   Our waiter was so sweet and quick on his feet. The staff is amazing and I think why everything works so well is because they have such a good sense of teamwork in this place. Keep it up!!",

When we got there on a Friday night we surprisingly didn't have to wait even though we were a party of six. It's very loud and overwhelming when you first come in and sit down with your waiter giving you a quick explanation, asking for drinks, and what meat you want to start with. You can choose 3 meats at a time and bless our waiter for giving us double the meat servings with each order, we were a party of 6 with 4 large ex-football players who can eat. The fun part was trying all the different kinds of meat and our favorite was the bulgogi. It was delicious and the first time most of us had it. The person in the middle got stuck cooking most of everything so be forewarned, pick your seat wisely! It was a bit frantic at first with just rapidly cooking but once we started to get more full it slowed down and became more fun. Now that we've been there I probably don't need to rush back due to the cost but it was fun for to show visitors.",

    "text": "This place was Ssssooooo close to getting one star. So close. I've had Korean bbq in several bigs cities - Chi-town, NYC, ATL... I may not be Korean but I'm a pretty good judge of food so i know good Korean BBQ. The risk of one star had absolutely nothing to do with the food or waitstaff - it's all due to the seating arranged by the hostess.   Came here on a Friday night around 5:30 with a party of 14. We were told It would be 40-45 min wait. The hostess pointed out two tables in the front and said that would be ours. We put down our name and headed next door to Seoul for beers while we wait. 30 min later, we check with the hostess and was told it's another 40 min wait again. No reasoning, no explanation. We glanced over at the tables that were supposed to be ours and noticed there's two new sets of customers seated there. Wait - did you just give our tables to someone else? And failed to update us? When we realized that, we went back to the hostess and was told those two tables couldn't accommodate 14 people so they had to change the plan. I was beyond livid. Why were we told one thing and not updated when the plan changed? At this point it's been an hour and a half wait. I don't mind waiting but when you're told 40 min and it's been 90 min, something's gotta give. Because we already invested so much time - not to mention we're here to celebrate my 18 year wedding anniversary - we decided to continue to wait. Luckily our name was called about 5 min after the showdown with the hostess.   We get to our seat and it's three tables. Our friends visiting from MN were on the opposite side so there was absolutely no interaction with them during the meal. Another negative.   Now on to the food. As soon as we sat down, someone came by to take drink orders and the ban chan (side dishes) were dropped off. Before our waters were even given, another person (our waiter) came by to take our food orders and It went uphill from there. I'm talking from a 1 star to a full 5 stars right away.   All of the side dishes were delicious. The meats were so flavorful- definitely the best bulgolgi I've ever had. Packed with flavor. The dipping sauces were plentiful and on point. Try the corn cheese. I know It sounds weird but there's something about gooey mozzarella cheese melted over sweet corn that paired together so well. Who would've thunk It? My 10 year old nephew has to be the pickiest eater alive. He eats a total of 6 things in the world- rice and chicken, rice and eggs, pizza, nachos, cheeseburger and nuggets with fries. That's It. I was not looking forward to paying $12 for nothing but surprisingly, I gave him chunks of pork belly crisped up on the grill over a bowl of rice and he rated It 10 out of 10. That's saying a lot!!!   Let's talk about the service for a minute. Can I give them 5 stars too? I mean, my table consisted of 6 people, 3 of which we're guys over 200 lbs each. And we stayed taken care of. Ask for more rice? You get it right away. You didn't even have to ask for drink refills, you automatically get a glass that's kept full. No matter how many times we asked for additional items, everyone stayed friendly and obliging. Our waitress Camilla must be an angel sent from heaven cause she put up with our neediness with a smile fixed on her face. Gratuity was included in our bill but each of our three tables gave more tips on top of It because our wait staff was impeccable. Then at the end of our meal, the manager or owner walked around and talked to us. Man I wish every place was like this. They have seriously ruined me for customer service anywhere else. All in all, even though we had issues with the hostess and the wait time, we will definitely be regulars here. Just not with a large party again.   Thank you Let's Meat for putting Charlotte on the map when It comes to Korean bbq. You did not disappoint!",

Even though we have been to Kbbq in bigger cities, I'm glad that they opened one near by. Cravings satisfied.  $29.99 per person with a 2 hour dining limit. It's worth it!  We definitely recommend it! Can't wait to come back!  Sowell",

    "text": "Exactly what Charlotte has been needing!  I could not wait to until this place opened and made sure I was there on their grand opening.  Located right beside Soul Meat, the parking I can see being an issue on the weekends when they are probably the busiest but there seems to be a lot of street parking.  Once the doors were finally open for business, the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Giving out menus to review before we were seated and answering questions. Even though it was grand opening day it was not overcrowded and we did not have to wait for a table. There are plenty of tables and many are able to accommodate large parties which is great.  Once we were seated at our table our grill was immediately lighted by one of the staff and our server came over to explain the process and start putting in orders for our table. We received all Banchans (side dishes) that are used in Korean BBQ and all of them were fresh and tasted amazing. At $30 a hour per person, we ordered almost every meat on the menu. Don't let the $30 a hour per person discourage or alarm you. I have been to authentic Korean restaurants in Korea and a few in the States and this is probably the best deal because ordering a la carte at other restaurants can really start adding up and kind of leave you still feeling hungry.  Our favorite meats we ordered was the Pork belly, thin and original and the fatty beef brisket. We ordered the spicy chicken but we did not really enjoy it, it was a little too spicy and really no flavor besides that. We loved having both options of rice and lettuce to eat with our meat and side dishes. I don't believe we even got close to the 2 hour limit, we probably only ate for a hour because the serve was so great. We always quickly received our new order of meat for the grill and side dishes.  Having been to Korea and trying to find a restaurant that was similar to the authentic Korean BBQ we had in Korea, Let's Meat by far has been the closest thing to what we had in Korea. The concept of cooking your own food and ordering what you like for a flat rate I'm sure will be very popular as the word gets out about the restaurant.",

Pork belly marinated in different sauce were mostly the choices. The veggie plate came with only 3 kinds of veggie: onion, zucchini,and carrots. Little side dishes were ok only  but I loved the salad. I probably won't return. But if you like to experienced Korean bbq with the drive to GA. Give it a go.",

Our waiter was super nice and gave us recommendations and explained the menu for us. The menu doesn't have a lot of options but the portions were fairly big. When it comes to BBQ, you can't go wrong with beef tongue, pork belly, fatty beef, and bulgogi! The price wasn't bad either and it was a pretty fair price compared to paying for individual dishes. Drinks were fairly cheap and if you you're alcohol tolerance is pretty low like mine, best choice is makgeolli, which is Korean rice wine, and peach flavor makgeolli is the best to go. The noice level was average, mostly listening to EDM music and some hip hop the most. It was hard to listen to my friend's conversation but honestly they got a good music playlist. I would recommend people coming here for lunch and dinner. I would definitely come back here to Charlotte when I take another spontaneous trip!",

I walked in with two small children (ages 3 and 7) and my 84 year old grandmother to get a table while my sister parked the car. When I requested a table for five, she tells us she will seat us as soon as the fifth person comes in. We ask why we can't just be seated now, that the other person will be in shortly, and she tells \"Ok, but we'll start your clock for 2 hours\". Seriously? What is this, a buffet?? Even if we were seated without the rest of our party being there, we would need a few minutes to look at the menu, the order to come out, and the food to cook so that would cut into our time anyway. What she said and especially HOW she said it was completely unnecessary and only turned us off from wanting to eat there. We wouldn't stuff our faces for 2 hours ANYWAY! It doesnt matter how good the food is (which was average, btw) if the staff sucks. People want to go where they feel welcome! I'd give zero stars if I could.",

    "text": "Went on a Friday night with a group of nine; couple of people were running late so we waited at the bar for a few drinks. I accidentally spilled a full drink all over the counter and floor , but hostess was super cool and laughed it off. That was a good example of the kind of service this place has; everyone is super chill and on top of it. After we were seated, we ordered the large prime beef combo , the large marinated beef combo, as well as a chicken and shrimp (one of our friends doesn't eat red meat). The food was amazing! I'd gone to Jongro with my wife the weekend before, and while I'd say that the beef there was a little higher quality, let's meat was definitely in the ballpark. Also the vibe was great; clean, lots of energy but not pretentious at all. We kept on ordering drinks (2 bottles of wine, some beers and a bottle of Soju), and the waiters comped us a free entree because one of the bottles we wanted wasn't available! It was a marinated pork  and tofu dish and it was amazing as well. Overall, we ended up staying for about three hours, and it cost ~$70/head with all of that food and drink (which is actually really good for nyc). Highly recommend; if you're looking for high quality Korean BBQ without the wait it should definitely be on your short list of places in the city to go.",
