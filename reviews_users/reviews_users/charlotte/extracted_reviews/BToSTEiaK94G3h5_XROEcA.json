They have the absolute best tamales I have eaten in the Charlotte area and possibly any restaurant.  I can't say enough about how good the tamales are but their other menu items are delicious also.  The Chimichangas are out of this world and the fajitas are good too.  I love the food here, the atmosphere and the prices can't be beat.  If you are looking for great mexican food at a great price look no further because you have found it here!  I hope you'll stop by and find out for yourself!",

    "text": "Finally made it to lunch here yesterday. I used to enjoy cheap lunch at Plaza Fiesta whenever I went down for gas fill-up. Now that Plaza Fiesta is gone (I wonder where did G.H. Bass move to... anyone knows?), my choice for lunch down in Carowinds Blvd is limited to basically one.   Westinghouse isn't exactly on my way to and from anywhere, but I couldn't resist my curiosity. I took a detour, and was glad that I did. I got to the restaurant shortly after 1. There's really no system to the operation; by that I mean there's not a permanent hostess, so just say hi to whoever walking by to get their attention. I recognized the man who used to run the food court location (I'm sure he didn't recognize me) and he promptly sat me at a booth. The decor is kind of groovy. Bright orange walls, Ikea style sphere paper light fixtures. The place is obviously a lot nicer than the crowded food court. I saw on their doors that they have karaokes and live music too.  The lunch special menu is served during the week for $5.99. You have several options and the meat choices are little more authentic than the typical Mexican joint (thank goodness, because I'm here to have my lengua and al pastor). I was curious about the sopes, so I asked my waitress instead of having 2 sopes or 2 tacos lunch special if I can have 1 of each. She said sure but she didn't explain that she's basically ringing it up as individual items. My lunch \"special\" ended up being $6.75 instead $5.99, no biggie, but she could have informed me upfront. (FYI, taco is still $1.75 each, sope is $2 each, and apparently rice & beans is $2.99) Don't forget to ask for the avocado pepper sauce. It's not as hot as it used to be, but still good. I think overall it's a good cheap lunch spot.",

Our server was friendly and attentive to our needs. However, our food was bland and left a lot to be desired. Also, the margaritas were very weak and tasted watered down.",

I am old school as I am from New Mexico where the standard of Mexican food is very high. I grew up with fresh food at home and the food I took out of this restaurant brought back memories of my childhood. It was truly a great and exciting time for me as I have a very hard time with all the yuppy food others are trying to pass off as genuine. THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL DEAL. I will recommend them to all my friends and hopefully they will stay afloat long enough to become one of my favorite haunts.

Wish I could have had a margarita too, but I'm currently prego. I was greeted within a couple of minutes with chips and salsa. Good but pretty standard. A few minutes later someone came for my order. I ordered right away. Then I was forgotten about. A family of 4 was seated at the table next to me, ordered, ate their entire meal, and their table was cleared away before my 2 tacos & one tamale came out. During my 40 minute wait all I did was watch a \"DJ\" while he played on his phone and rotated some seriously horrible music and flashed stage lights around the room. Kind of strange for 5:30pm. A manager never addressed my (lack of a) meal, and my waitress looked so terrified that I was going to get upset once she realized that I didn't have my food I just waited patiently without mentioning it. The food itself was ok. The tamale had decent flavor but wasn't temperature hot, the sour cream on the tacos looked completely liquified. I've seen lots of good reviews on the place and I'll give it one more chance. Hopefully next time is better.",

Plays all different types of music that flow as the night progresses. For you pool junkies the y have a small room past the bar filled with a few tables so you can just drink n play if you choose. Also a small little Mexican shop to get candy, drinks, spices and very VERY weird pinatas.   FUN LAUGHS GOOD TIMES",

Looks a little iffy from the outside, but the inside is pretty modern and updated. Everything looked very clean, and the bar was full with people eating/drinking.  My wife and I both got tacos --- pretty good! Nothing to write home about, but for the price I'll definitely be back. Our favorites were the chipotle chicken & the pineapple pork. If you come on Tuesdays, they have $1 tacos (with drink purchase I was told). Thursdays are $4.50 margs ... a fun place to come with some friends for cheap food and drinks!",

It has been difficult to find delicious Mexican since moving to NC but I have been pleasantly surprised by La Poblanita every time I visit.   The tortilla chips always come out warm and thankfully are only lightly salted. The salsa that goes with them is delicious! It has the perfect consistency between liquid and solid and a spice level that lets you know it is there without overwhelming.  My most recent visit I opted for the Pollo Fundido and it was amazing! They seasoned the tender chicken perfectly - and who doesn't want their meal smothered in cheese? The plate was huge and I was barely able to finish it all (possibly because of the amount of chips and salsa I had consumed before).   I am also quite partial to their nachos which I frequently order after I have spent some time at the bar next door. I cannot speak to the quality as a menu item but as a late night munchies food it has always been perfection.",

They food isn't quite the typical standard mexican, same menu as everyone else. Of course, they have the similar menu items, but somewhat unique. I've had several different kind of tacos and always excellent. My wife and children had other menu items and never any complaint. The best thing about this restaurant is the live mariachi band on Friday night. I had so much fun listening to the band and just enjoying the experience. They came around to each table and played requests. My daughter got up and dance the Macarena with them. Awesome memory! Please go and check out the restaurant on Friday night, enjoy the band, and then you'll be back. See you there.",

Original style consists of corn tortillas, a meat of your choice, onions, cilantro, and slices of radish. Beef tongue and chorizo tacos are so good and for $1 a pop, you can't beat it; not to mention chips and salsa once you sit down. They bring out three different salsas to go with your uh-mazing tacos and they're all delish. Let's not forget a $2.50 can of Tecate to top off the meal.   The service is also great! Their usual waiter, Raul, is the BEST! He's so nice, always has a smile and is very attentive with the diners! He really makes the dining experience worthwhile.

We were with a party so we ordered quite a bit of food, but they weren't too busy at all. Times before It's been very busy and we've seemed to receive our food in a timely manner. Just about everyone at our table either received the wrong order or didn't receive anything at all. They would bring out our food in sessions and not even our correct orders. Our drinks were not refilled once. The service was horrible, they had employees just standing around with dirty tables. The poor couple was just standing about looking around, waiting for them to clean a table off for them. The actual waiter and the food was..okay. I'm surprised the waiter just didn't give up. The service has NEVER been this bad. To be honest, I don't ever see myself returning here. That's quite sad considering this used to be my go to for authentic $1 tacos on Tuesday. Not any longer.",

We sat at the bar, which is what we prefer.  While my husband was in their candy store,  I waited to be served.  And waited.  My husband returned and surprised I did not order at least a drink yet.  One of the reasons we sit at the bar is for quicker service.   Finally a server came over and we ordered Negra Modelos. Upon his return with the beer, there were limes in them.  Never had that before.  Yeah, it's a Mexican beer but it's not a Pacifico or Corona.   We ordered the Milinesa, which was very delicious.  Because the food was so good,  we ordered a Milinesa  Torta to go. Huge mistake as it is the kind of meal that only tastes good when eaten fresh and not reheated.   My husband wanted a tequila shot. While he went to the restroom,  I attempted to order a shot. I asked which one had a smoother taste,  as I know this shot can have a bite from previous experience but, I digress. Apparently,  the server took this to mean I was asking for the cheapest.  He brushed me off and gave me a negative vibe as if he was insulted. By the time my husband returned he still had no shot. The server returned and again asked which tequila, directing the conversation at him only. He got one finally.    At this point,  I just wanted to go.  I felt unwelcomed and although the meal we originally ordered was good, I will not return here. Service can go a long way and I did not appreciate being dismissed like that.",

Im from NYC and have had the opportunity to eat at multiple Mexican restaurants, so it was a pleasure to find an authentic Mexican restaurant in South Charlotte. The food is fresh and the waitstaff are very polite and accommodating. I always enjoy the mariachi band and the atmosphere is great. The tamales are excellent.  This is my 3rd time here and I would definitely recommend this restaurant",

If you like spicy, ask them for their spicy sauces to go with the chips and salsa it was pretty delicious. We went on a Friday night and there was a mariachi band which was super cool. They walked around and serenaded the tables and asked for requests. The food was pretty good. The taco was delicious. The only reason I gave them one less starves cause I got an enchilada and it didn't have any cheese in it, and usually every other enchilada I've had has had cheese so it tasted a little funny. We will def be going back though it wasa great little Mexican place.",

The Kenny G flavored smooth jazz doesn't help matters much. By the time I was seated, my senses were very confused. Smelled Mexican, but it looks and sounds like The Jetsons.   My first step was to order a house marg, which came accompanied by chips. A little late - but pretty good if you ask for the hotter sauce and the verde to go with.   Carnitas seemed easy - they were a good sized portion served with refried beans and rice, a splut of guacamole salad and salsa with no cheese in sight. Carnitas lacked pizazz for the only Mexican restaurant that I'd describe as \"Kubrickian.\"  Beans and rice were passable.   I asked for extra tortillas and was told they would be extra. Always take points off for that.   The server was sweet and nice enough and the music choices improved  (kongos!) as time went on. It's not the worst I've had and far from the best. It's a place with a palpable identity crisis and that was foreshadowed by way of the \"Help Wanted\" sign on the front door.   I've heard they're bouncing back from an unexpected move and expansion, so here's to hoping they find the right combo that works. Right now, there's work to be done.",

Horchata taste really water down, no flavor whatsoever.  The fajitas were ok I didn't like the texture of the chicken.  My rice was kinda greasy Overall the food taste bland and it's passable but not great.

I sent it back, and the server came back in seconds and obviously the tomatoes had just been picked off then smothered in more sauce (which again, I only said lettuce and cheese). As soon as I picked up my tacos I realized they were corn, not flour tortillas. Server already seemed irritated with me so it wasn't worth bringing up. Very disappointing experience after reading the reviews. If you aren't picky you'll love it, but if you're like me and like your tacos only a certain way, be careful.",

The restaurant is small enough to see every corner from where we were sitting, we could also see the bar.  She comes and grabs our drink order (two waters and a frozen strawberry margarita) once she left.... she never returned. We waited close to 20 minutes just for the water at least and she never brought it. The other waitresses were too occupied with their own tables to notice that we had still been sitting with open menus and no drinks , so we left after another 10 minutes.  The hostess told us to have a nice day, which was polite but just added to the aggravation. I told her our waitress never came back and we left.",

Beans under seasoned with a bit of a burnt undertaste as if someone left in the pot and forgot about them for a bit. Rice is quite good. Now for the not so nice. 1. Had to ask for silverware..twice. 2. Ordered cheese dip and hot salsa. They didn't show. Asked for cheese dip again and twice for the hot salsa. 3. Tables seated after us were served and eating...our orders were not complicated compared to theirs. Not worth a repeat call for us.",

    "text": "This place was a fav, but I begin to notice on calling in a \"to-go\" order, things we're getting pretty bad. Well, last night was the worse, and why on all nights after I invited 2 others to try it. My simple non-dairy taco salad, was the absolute worst ever. Request was just rice, ground beef, lettuce, and pica. She kept asking no cheese, no beans, etc., and I emphasized that that the ingredients I ordered was all I wanted,  reiterating no dairy and this is all to be on the salad. Well, it was still horrible. My friends had 2 flour tacos, no cilantro, no onions, etc... but needless to say, they said they would prefer Taco Bell. I was embarrassed. We live about 9 miles away, and instead of going back, just said time to find a place. A $29 lesson, but I saw it coming. Being lactose intolerant and getting this food is dangerous, I know. It's over after a late night of sickness. Sad, cause they keep getting new people and apparently some that don't understand its a business and getting the orders correct is part of it. Well, you may want to start with servers who actually care. She made me know cause I was a pickup order, I was irrelevant. I had been going here for near 2 years, but I searched and may have found a new home for my salad. Good luck! Consistency is not something you will find here.",

Stepping inside the white tables and the white sofas are definitely an eye grabber. I loved the ambience of this restaurant! They had a complete bar, two snooker tables, lot of colorful banners hanging around, a little stage with some DJ like equipments. I was rather impressed! The menu was extremely colorful - we were even offered free shots of cinnamon and whiskey! We got some good nachos and salsa! We ordered our food and started digging in the chips with the great ambience and the good Mexican music. Everything was good till that moment - but then we waited for our food, we waited and waited! Finally came out some plates - then we had to wait for some more time till they completed the order! We had trouble trying to get the attention of our waitress as she was taking care of multiple other things across a large room. The food was okay. But finally after the bill came, we noticed they weren't same as advertised in the menu.   Ours wasn't a pleasant experience - may be I should try going there at a less busy time to see if it's really worth the star rating it has.",

    "text": "As a South Texan, It is so terribly hard to not like an authentic Mexican place in Charlotte, I feel akward writing a less than positive review.  First, let me say that I have received nothing but glowing recommendations for this place.  Friends and family alike keep telling me that I'll love their food and atmosphere. Why? Because they all know I live for my chips, salsa, and guacamole.    Just the other day I was told I need to try this place out.  I had hesitated for a bit because I didn't want to start contemplating which Mexican place was best in Charlotte.  But, I decided to bite the bullet and jump in.  We came here tonite and received the boilerplate greeting. We headed to the bar and sat down without any fanfare.  After a few minutes I looked to my left and noticed that they had a candy store of some sort. Score! I am so into Mexican candies.  I shot over there and looked around for a bit and finally headed back to the Bar and asked a server if they had my favorite candy: coconut rolos. Yes! They had one left and I bought that without blinking.  And it was half the price of buying online. Schwing.  By the time I had headed back to my wife we had apparently been assigned a server. He never introduced himself, but later I would discover his name. The first time we met he asked what we wanted to drink; which tequila we wanted to drink actually.  I asked about the specials and the menu and this is where all the miscomfort seemed to begin.   Our server gave us a  menu and walked away.  He came back a bit later and we ordered a couple of unremarkable beers. It took a dozen minutes to get our beers and he had placed limes in the beers.  Guess that makes since for Tecate or Corona beers,  but we had Negro Modelos. Never had that before.   We finally got to order the steak Milinesa and also placed an order for a steak Torta to go.  The Milinesa was divine. In point of fact it was crazy good.  The refried beans were weak and the rice was just a bit above average, but the Milinesa and corn tortillas were freaking perfect.   My wife and I devoured the food.  Out server returned once to give us our Torta which we had ordered to go.  We tried to make small talk; Went so far as to joke  about the quality of Mexican food in North Carolina; He was not impressed.  We finished up the goodness and decided it was time for a bit more to drink.   I wanted tequila. I had not had that in a bit; And while I was visiting with the folks around me, my wife asked our \"server\" about Tequila shots.  She wanted to know which was smooth vs which might have a bite. He immediately took the question as \"which is the cheapest?\" By the time I came back and she mentioned the conversation he abruptly turned away from her and asked me to choose something to drink.  Ok. This was a gift drink from my wife.  I was shocked that he had blown her off; seems like he just wanted to make a sale.    Moving on.  I had my Tequila shot and got my wife a less potent drink and we finished up the nite.  After mentioning closing out twice we finally got our bill.  When it came, it was unremarkable. Not a bad value.   Like I said, I liked this place.  I really want to go again. I am just a little taken back by the server we had. Service makes all the difference. I feel like my \"server\" was anoyed and just wanted us gone. Man, it was a very stressful experience and I'll be hard pressed to get my wife there again.   Food in my opinion was high 4 stars.  Loved everything with a few minor observations that only folks who grew up eating Mexican would understand.  It was the service that killed my opinion of this place. It's a 1.    Will I go back? Likely for the candy store and for to go orders. Will I dine in? Not at the moment.  Bummer.",

We gave it a full 15 minutes before we flagged the hostess down.  She seemed wildly hurried and it didn't result in anyone coming to our table.  We gave it another full 10 minutes (keep in mind our allotted lunch is 1 hour) and then just got up and walked out.  We drove around the corner to Don Pedros; we were seated and eating within another 15 minutes.   I'm glad this place has gained popularity, but I guess it's not a place to go if you're on a firm timeline  :-(",

They were not cheap with the tequila, I love when I don't feel like I'm waisting my money.   The manager or owner came over with tequila shots for everyone...twice... on the house. Who doesn't love that? Our waitress was the right amount of at the table, she knew we were hanging out so didn't bother us much.  She was really lovely!   The bathrooms were ok, clean enough. Nothing fancy, just enough. Just a tip.... the first stall is a tricky one. My friend got stuck and I had to unlock it with a dime :)   The Mariachi band was amazing, fun, good and we really enjoyed them.   We will be back, next time I will bring my kids.

After waiting for about 5 minutes she finally came over, I asked are you still serving...after asking what time it was, she looks at the wife and says \"I guess\".  Don't get me wrong, I know it's a Tuesday and it's 9:15 but you're open until 10...it's not like I walked in at 9:50 (which if you have a good restaurant should still mean the same level of service). With an answer like that and a look that felt like we had just insulted her we decided to walk out. The food may be good, but I'm not willing to roll the dice based on that interaction alone. We drove 10 minutes down the road to a Five Guys that also closes at 10 and we're immediately greeted with a smile and good food. In a world with some much competition for food you're first impressions are important.",

Sadly, we waited over 10 min for anyone to come and that is only after I went up and told the hostess to send someone over.  She took our order first and finally brought some chips and dip and drinks.  Two of the three orders came out wrong.  I didn't dare send them back as I knew it would be a long wait.   Now to the food.  They only thing I can say is that the only taste I was able to discern was HOT red sauce.  The huarache crust was completely tasteless, as was the rest of the dish.  My son had an enchilada with rice and beans and it was acceptable.  The waitress never came back for drink refills or more chips.  Again I flagged the hostess for help.     We just got our check and left.  What a disappointing experience.  Don't recommend at all.",

Unfortunately, as it turns out La Pob did not live up to the presentation that my friends have me. I was seated by one of the host who took me to a booth for seating which was okay since I was alone. After me telling her that this was my first time dining with there she begin to tell me about the drink specials and then the food. She told me that it was Taco Tuesday and the I could get any of the Tacos listed for a $1.00 with the purchase of a drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) so I order a Shirley Temple. She only took my drink order and told me that my waitress would be there shortly to take my order. Shortly thereafter another young lady approached and asked me if I had been helped yet. I responded the host had taken my drink order but no one had taken my food order. She proceeded to take my order. It was my plan to order quite a few of the Tacos since my friends had bragged on them. For starters I ordered 2steak and 1pork all hard crunchy shell.",

The inside is bright, eclectic, clean, and comfortable.  We've tried both the burrito and the chimichanga.  There are a variety of meats to pick from (including beef tongue!), and I'd highly recommend the chicken, or pineapple pork. The portions are huge, so be prepared to come hungry, or you'll be taking leftovers home.  Ask for the other salsas! They bring you a delicious picante, but if you ask, they will bring you a small tray of three other salsas: one is Verde, one is avocado based, and one is a smoky hot orange (I'm guessing chili based).  The margaritas are huge, and cheap compared to other places, same with the beer.  The wait staff is pleasant, and attentive. Check out the candy store before you leave! There are some interesting things on there!",

Quite a selection of what you would see in any Mexican store.  Many \"sour\" items, along with many tamarind flavored things.  Candy bars, lollypops and loose candy.    For ethnic Latinos it will bring back memories and enjoyment.  But for most non-Latino Americans the candies are something unique to try, but, in my opinion, not much to brag about.  A multi-cultural experience for your family, especially after you have finished your meal at La Poblanita.    Something different and fun.",

On one recent visit, they delivered my table's food to the wrong table. We waited 30 minutes for our order before the server noticed something was wrong and then it still came out wrong.  On another recent visit, the drinks were wrong and again they gave us the wrong orders at first before we caught them and had them switch with the table behind us. And then it took forever to get tortillas for my fajitas and the fajitas were bland.  I think it's time to revisit some of the other Mexican places around here.

We were told the avocados they were having trouble getting them WHAT!! So you can order a side dish an pay for it the menu states it comes with it!! I asked the waitress were they giving me  sour cream or extra beans?? She said extra lettuce When my dish came the queso was very salty an the refried beans instead of what they normally serve we got some watered down beans on our plates. My friend called over the manager she knows now heres some  lies he told us SMH he tried to tell us because of the tariffs boxes of avocados were 20 a case now 120 an up. Everybody has to blame someone for their own mistakes right!! Funny I was in Aldi the next day   Avocados were ,69 Each. If produce was that pricey Aldi an Food lion would be selling  them for 3-4 dollars. I wont be back unless they fix whatever problem They are having.",

Definitely your traditional Hispanic owned restaurant. The menu was the basic items you would expect and of course you got chips and salsa to start off with. They actually gave three additional sauces to try in addition to your typical salsa.   I ended up getting the steak fajitas for $13. The steak was seasoned very well and the food came out hot. My friend had a chimichanga and it was very big. We both had leftovers for the next day. I also tried her strawberry margarita she ordered and it was delicious BIG like you want your margaritas to be.   I think this place could be skipped over even with the bright paint on the outside ,  but I recommend it if you just want some good classic hispanic food.",

Can you believe that there is a candy shop inside as well? I ventured inside and it's all ethnic candies really cool! Overall quality of food is great and I will be coming back for more!",

The salsas were very flavorful & filling. I almost forgot to take a picture too cause I was so hungry . You know I got my horchata, cause duh! Could've used more cinnamon? It was a little watery but not too much.   The margaritas are a must. Nice size glasses and they are definitely potent.   Our sever was really nice too. She gave us some options of salsa to try and we mostly fell in love with the guacamole salsa! I put it on all my tacos lol.   All in all, if you're looking for some great authentic Mexican food, I would suggest coming here and pigging out without feeling it in your wallet.   Ample parking and great for parties or small gatherings!   This could get addicting and I just might become a regular!",

On the inside It is super cute with a fresh, updated look.  Tastefully decorated with authentic Mexican decorations and Pinatas but not cluttered looking at all.  It was hustling and bustling during lunch time but the staff was very welcoming!    I ordered the lunch steak fajitas.  They came on a skillet with onions and green and red bell peppers .  The steak was cut up finely and slightly charred perfectly.  Served with rice and beans.  The steak fajitas were flavorful and juicy.  The beans had a smoky taste that was very good!  Great portions.    Also ordered the tres leches for dessert.  Great presentation on the plate.  Very appetizing when it came out.  What I  enjoyed more was that it wasn't overly sweet nor overly saturated in the different milks.   It was moist and \"just right\".   Niky was our server.  Service with a smile,  she was Knowledgeable on the menu. There was a slight mix up in the kitchen with my order and she was very attentive and graceful in getting the order corrected quickly.    I plan to visit again soon and Im certain that this will quickly become one of my favorite places for Mexican!",

When you first pull into the parking lot it's a huge empty spot with one building in the middle and can give you the feeling of deserted/dangerous especially on a cold and eerie night. Kinda shady bc there's a sports bar attached to it in the back called Trap House. But looks can be deceiving right. Absolutely. When you walk in, you're greeted with a friendly home-y kitchen vibe. Decorations all over the brightly painted walls. Mexican/Latin music playing on speakers. Feels almost as if you were invited to a party of one of your Hispanic friend's house. We had a party of 15, and called ahead to see if they were able to accommodate such a large party and to our surprise when we arrived we were seated in a separate area where they host larger groups. It was a nice gesture but also kind of weird, kinda felt separated. But we were also next to the pool tables so it was a eh-yay-eh feeling.   We had the carne asada which is steak, and it came with yellow rice, re-fried beans -which I normally don't care for, guacamole, pico de gallo, tortilla, and grilled or charred pepper. It was amazingly Mexican and delicious. We also ordered two traditional tacos one al pastor - which is pork with pineapple, and the second was chicken chorizo both with cilantro and onion. There's also loaded tacos that come with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. I was also feeling under the weather so we got the Thursday-Sunday only soup, beef soup. SO GOOD. Overall great Mexican experience.",

They bring out chips and traditional salsa right away and ask if you want the hot salsas which are extremely hot but perfect to out on tour tacos. The chimichangas are awesome as well. They ridice is seasoned well and beans are creamy.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside and is pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant. The service is always great.",

I ordered takeout and the food and menu were much like it was at the Plaza Fiesta spot. However, this is a full-service restaurant with a bar and servers. Some of the interior is rough - there are light covers above the bar that are broken and the building itself has some wear on it. It really doesn't matter though because they have a good sanitation grade which is posted on the door and visible from outside. The food was also delicious and fresh. It definitely is authentic with items like tripe and beef tongue. Everyone here was also friendly and I like that they have their chip-enabled credit card reader visible at the front of the restaurant.",

So, when I go to a new place, I always try to keep an open mind and not compare them to other places. That said, this place, hands down, is in my top 3 that I've been to in the US. I  I ordered the combo. I had a steak taco and a chicken tostada. It came with rice and beans. The star of the show was definitely the tostada. It was the best one I've ever had. The taco was really good, but don't expect the American version with cheese all over it. It will be very authentic. The rice was just okay and the beans were normal. But that won't stop me from coming back.   While I was eating, I peaked over near the side of the bar and noticed a sign that said \"Candy Store.\"  My eyes lit up like a Christmas tree! I've never had any Mexican candy so I didn't really know what to get or try. I thought I would take it slow and get some chocolate. Wow! It was so good and creamy. I will say this also, this candy is actually from Mexico and not just distributed in the US. I know this for sure because I loved the candy so much, I went to a Supermarcdo the next day looking for it and noticed the store only had the ones distributed in the US.   Try this place! Get you some tostadas and finish it off with some Carlos V Chocolate or some Bubu Lubu.",

Went Saturday evening with family and was immediately seated in a very nicely decorated and open interior. We started with the queso topped with jalapenos. Not even gonna lie, I'm a queso snob and that was some of the best queso I've ever had! Their complimentary salsa was cold and fresh. These appetizers definitely started us off right. My fiance ordered the strawberry margarita, it came in a large glass and no lie was strawberry flavored tequila haha! That drink was strong, but he loved it.   For dinner, I ordered the chimichanga with grilled chicken, my sister (pescatarian) ordered the chimichanga  with grilled shrimp, and the fiance ordered four corn tortilla tacos. Those chimichangas were everything I needed for a cheat day and the Spanish rice was so delicious and well seasoned. My fiance didn't love his tacos, but attributed it to them being more authentic than the Tex-Mex tacos he's accustomed to.   Overall our food was so delicious. I was in a food coma for hours following this meal. I loved this place and will visit anytime I find myself in Charlotte!   P.S. The staff here was SOOOO kind! And kind waitstaff makes all the difference when dining somewhere. Definitely check out this Mexican food gem.",

Since it 5 de Mayo Mu husband and I decided to eat some Mexican food and La Poblanita was the chosen one. I've passed by this restaurant so many times but never noticed it. I love the decoration inside and outside. The colors of the walls are vibrant and they have pinatas hanging all over the ceiling, so cool! We got there around 2pm and were sat right away. The waitress brought us chips and salsa that were really good and we placed our order. Their menu have menu options and pictures of the plates which I thought was cool since it helps you out when you don't know how the dish looks like. My husband and I had the exactly same thing: Beef Tostada, rice, beans and a grilled chicken taco. We both enjoyed our meal, was delicious, authentic and unique. The restaurant was busy but nothing too much, but even though our food took a while to get ready. Our waitress also took forever to bring our check and we had to ask for it twice. Other than that we can't complain, great food, great prices, cute place! They have a candy store at the restaurant with Mexican candy, my husband tried different kinds of chocolates and bubble gum, he felt in love and said they were the best chocolate he's ever had.

    "text": "Tacos tacos tacos! Listen up fellow Yelpers - this place is tacos galore! And I'm not talking about the crunchy shells or soft flour tortillas of Taco Bell or the bland tacos you get at every other \"Mexican-like\" restaurant. I'm talking about the flavorful soft corn tortilla taco that you can get from the street stalls in Mexico. The one where the corn tortilla is made fresh in house, the meat is marinated and cooked to perfection and toppings only include cilantro, white onions and a side of lime that you freshly squeeze on top for a little acidity to cut the richness of the meat. Yep, that's the kind of taco I rolls with. They offer the Americanized option to add lettuce, cheese and sour cream. But why disgrace a taco like that? If that's what you like - go to Taco Bell!  I came with friends for dinner Friday night and was very surprised at the selection of tacos available. I opted for one chorizo, one steak and one tripe taco to accompany my chimichanga. Why so much food? Well, I was hungry. No judgment, ok?  Like every other Mexican place, they serve you free chips and salsa while you wait for your meal. The difference here is the quality of the chips and salsa. Because their corn tortillas are made fresh in house, the chips you get have so much more flavor and freshness than you'd expect. The salsa was the perfect accompaniment to the chips.  My friend and I each ordered a house margarita with a salt rim. I chose mango (cause no other fruit compares to a mango) while my friend opted for the green apple. Check out the size of the margarita glasses - I went to pick It up and was surprised how heavy It was. There wasn't as much alcohol as I'd like. Maybe I'm just an alcoholic but I prefer stronger drinks, especially with the heavy price tag of $10. But I won't let that take away from the food.  The chimichanga was smothered in a white queso sauce that was delicious but the chicken inside was not to my liking. Too much onions, chicken was tough. The rice and beans, however were perfect. So why give 5 stars if I didn't like the margarita or chimichanga? Have you been listening? TACOS!  Each bite of the taco I ate was mouth watering flavorful scrumptiousness. It was so good, my friend pointed out that I closed my eyes and made weird sounds as I bit into It. Yea, It was eye closing, Harry Met Sally good. Chorizo was seared and full of spice, Steak was marinated and tender, tripe was stewed to tenderness then cooked in its own fat till it has a slightly crunchy exterior. And the amount of meat on each taco is ridiculous. I'm no salad-for-dinner kind of girl but 3 relatively small looking tacos filled my belly perfectly. Did I forget to mention the variety of salsas they give upon request? Three hot salsas that made my brow sweat while still mild enough to taste the individual flavors. They just serve to enhance each bite of taco. And it's only $2 each. Did you get that? Two buck chuck. How do they make a profit giving so much food at such a small price? Even better, they offer $1 tacos all day on Taco Tuesdays. Are you kidding me? A couple tacos, a couple beers - that's all I need on a Tuesday night.  This place is about 30 min from my house, 45 min if you add traffic. I don't care. Today is Tuesday. Can you guess where I'll be headed?  Treat yourself to some tacos. I wouldn't even bother with the other menu items. Well, maybe I'll try the elotes...",

They make the corn tortillas in house and there is nada on the tacos except onion, cilantro and a wedge of lime. Sorry, but that's exactly how it's supposed to be.   Delicious. Friendly service and a clean dining room. Can't ask for more for 5.99 lunch specials (add Flan for 1.99).  The decor is atypical for sure for American tastes but looked very similar to many restaurants in Mexico.  I'll be back!!",

The soft taco shells were way over cooked and actually tough to chew. The other patrons with me both ordered the tacos and were not pleased. I ordered the Enchiladas Rojas and the plate came out lukewarm at best. The Roja sauce was not very tasty on the enchiladas and the refried beans were bland and  pasty. The best part of the experience was the chips and salsa, the interior decor, and the service provided by the server. There is a lot of room for improvement.",

We were seated right away as it wasn't crowded and given chips and salsa immediately.  Both were tasty.  My husband had a margarita that was on special and it was very good.  I got a steak and vegetable dish and he got a chimichanga, both were enormous, cheap, and served quick.  I appreciate all of the above.

You have to get their original style tacos they never fall short in flavor. Original style consists of corn tortillas, a meat of your choice, onions, cilantro, and slices of radish. Beef tongue and chorizo tacos are so good and for $1 a pop, you can't beat it;   All in all definitely worth a visit for cheap authentic food from Latin America.",

I stopped in here the other night just by chance with one of my friends after our first day out by the pool for the year and when hunger struck Mexican food always calls my name. I really cant remember how we ended up here since it was a ways down the road from where we were.  Its located right next to The Trap bar on Westinghouse and while I have been there I don't remember seeing this place.   Let me start with the first thing I ordered which was a michelada which was on special for $4.....FOUR DOLLARS!!!! Yes I was already excited.. I am super particular about these and will absolutely not order them if the mix is not at least homemade. We sat at the bar and when I asked if the mix was homemade he just smirked at me and started to make it. I knew already it was going to be good. He used hot sauce seasonings lime juice it was made completely from scratch. It was to die for. I am now ruined for micheladas anywhere else. Not to mention this thing was huge it was a meal in itself. Now on to the food. I kept it simple and ordered nachos. There was literally nothing simple or boring about these nachos everything was fresh made the guac the chicken the toppings were super fresh especially the lettuce. These were hands down the best nachos I have ever had.  My friend ordered the Diablo shrimp I think was the name if it. I only tried one but it was amazing it was spicy savory and the shrimp were perfectly cooked too.   The staff was amazingly friendly and the place was very clean. They have plenty of parking outside in the lot they share with the trap. I am literally mad at myself for not having come here sooner and to say I will be back would be an understatement. I will definitlely be a regular here and cannot wait to try more of the surely amazing food.",

My mom didn't like her food which is to be expected. My son had hot dog and fries it looked yummy. They don't serve those nasty looking red hot dogs. My brother had wings and fries, the wings did look good as well, cooked to golden brown perfection. As far as tacos, I tried, chipotle chicken, grilled chicken, steak, and pulled pork. I enjoyed the grilled chicken and steak the best. Tacos are $1.00 on Tuesday. I also ordered a side of rice and beans. While I thought the serving was small, I enjoyed the rice because there are veggies in it. For the 6 tacos I had (they're small) I actually had just enough to finish off while eating my tacos. I look forward to coming back to trying something off the regular menu before I say I have found a new spot to frequent. Typically I get a chicken dish with rice and beans or fajitas. I also enjoyed my drink it was a margarita with a carona added. I'll give that two thumbs up. Not sure on the rating so I'll give it average right now.",

    "text": "On the hunt for some tacos de lengua and found them here.  I'm a taco truck junkie but didn't know where to find them here.  I drive by this place several times a week and I just liked the look of it and kept a mental note to come back.  I was on a mommy/daughter date and after enjoying some smoothies, we decided to go get some tacos.  When we walked in, there was only one other patron dining in but we also went at an odd time. After lunch and much too early for dinner.  We were seated immediately and after receiving a complimentary basket of chips with a side of salsa we ordered 5 tacos.  Three beef tongue tacos, one tripa de res taco and one chorizo taco.  I wanted to try something new and since I've never been wowed with anyone's al pastor taco, I gave the chorizo a shot after a suggestion by the waitress.  We got our tacos, our salsas/hot sauces with wedges of lime and a few slices of radish, just like we are used to.  The tongue taco was very tender and almost on par with our favorite food truck and had the perfect amount of cilantro and onion on it. The tripa taco was different because the tripe seemed to be deep fried because it was very crunchy, I'm used to it being more of a braised style but I really enjoyed the crispiness and the chorizo though a bit dry, had a nice flavor to it.  I was a little disappointed that none of the hot sauces were very hot and I just wanted a side of those pickled onions, carrots and habaneros to add some heat but at $2.00 a pop, I'll definitely be back.  And I wish that they doubled the tortilla on each taco because they are pretty thin. The place itself is a little dated but cute in its own way. There's a DJ on Friday and Saturday nights and I was told if you get there before 10pm, there's no cover charge.  The staff did a great job, was attentive and professional and even suggested we check out the candy shop.  We did, and found a few candies to try out but a lot of the stuff, we had no clue what it was but we were willing to experiment a little.  I was even told where I could find some taco trucks and Mexican bakeries and so I'll definitely be checking it out.  I'll definitely be back and hope to try their fundido, flautas and tortas next.  Fingers crossed, they won't disappoint.",

When we arrived the restaurant was empty, but Raoul had an energetic welcome for us and made us feel welcome. He excitedly went over their specials and we were happy to have him as our server. He even showed us this cool decorative trick that you can do with the paper from a straw. He even took a couple photos for us. Thanks Raoul! The food was the most authentic Mexican I have had in a long time, since being in Miami I guess.  Chips, Guacamole, Salsa, ALL ON POINT! My fiance enjoyed her huge margarita, To be honest I cant remember the names of our Entrees, but i ASSURE you!!! all the ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. A picture speaks a thousand words, so you can check out the photos I post of our meals.  I also appreciated that the portion sizes weren't ridiculous. Some places act like you need to always serve 1lb rice and beans with every plate. Quality trumps quantity!",

Dance my way to the table. Raul greeted us and was prompt, friendly, alert, and effective. The menu was easy to understand and the prices were unreasonably inexpensive. I ordered traditional tacos and a tamale. The carnitas taco was simply the best taco I've had in my entire life. The sauces and salsa were absolutely exceptional. The entire meal was spent discussing how happy we were that we made that decision to eat here. The absolute only reason I got a box was because I wanted to ration my food so I got to taste it again later tonight. Raul told us his name and gave it a personal touch by asking us to come in and ask for him. We joked that they must have made a deal with the devil to create food that spectacular. When the bill came we were shocked at affordable it was. I couldn't have asked for something more. The experience was wonderful and made my night. We will be returning on a regular basis to see our friend Raul and eat here. I am in love with this place.",
