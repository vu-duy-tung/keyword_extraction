    "text": "I was so excited to finally find a good Express Japanese spot but I was very disappointed. My husband and I ordered ( I order the hibachi steak). Our food came and mine was accidentally chicken instead of steak, no big deal. I go up expecting them to easily change it and they tell me its $1 to get steak as if they didn't believe that I had ordered steak to begin with. I go back and look at my receipt and see the guy had rung it up wrong (again-not my fault). So I'm searching for $1 for them to fix THEIR mistake. As I'm waiting for them to prepare my food again, I have no time to eat it because my husband was already finished and they were closing. I sat sipping the drink I had paid for. I get my food finally and go to refill my tea so I can just go home. It was only a minute or 2 after closing with about 6 or 7 people still there and they tell me they already turned the drink machines off and I couldn't refill my drink. Highly disappointed that because of their mistake my experience was no short of being pretty terrible.",

Neither of us had ever explored the neighborhood, so I checked Yelp for a recommendation, and you guys didn't steer me wrong!  We got there around 11:30 to beat the rush, but the staff seemed like a well-oiled machine and things were moving along swimmingly at noon when they got really busy.  The seating area is much bigger than I'd expected, including a covered patio in front, and there's a TV so you can catch up on the latest headlines.    You order at the counter, and I appreciate that there are about 20 express meals you can pick from.  I tried the chicken with broccoli, and the fella tried the steak with broccoli; throw in two waters, and we both got huge, delicious portions complete with shrimp sauce for $13.40.  A woman brought out our order, and they clean up after you, too.    The fella said this would definitely make the lunch rotation - it's cheap, tasty, and fast without making you feel rushed.",

It literally kept me going when I was in school at UNCC. The trick to ordering at Toyama is to call ahead. If you're just getting it to go; then, order as you're driving there, and tell them you'll be there in 5 minutes. They usually have your food ready upon arrival, and you can skip the line and pay at the pick-up register. Works for me every time.",

I was impressed because I had heard there is usually a line. I decided on the chicken and shrimp combination plate with broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots.  A few minutes minutes later my order was ready and I went home. Got home, sat down at the table, opened my styrofoam box ready to dig in and on the lid was a piece of hair. HAIR IN MY HIBACHI BOX! I immediately called the restaurant. Girl answered and I was told to hold. I held on the line while she took order after order. I was on hold for about 10 minutes. The girl never returned to the phone. Tried calling back several times phone just rang and rang or I received the busy signal. I'm pissed I wasted my hard earned $11. I will NEVER be back and I will be sure to tell everyone I know about my experience tonight. The customer service was horrible and the cleanliness doesn't seem to be there either.",

For the amount of food they give you the price is perfect as well. The only complaint I can think of is that the rice is never quite right when I visit. As if it's always just completely undercooked, but outside of that its perfect. The generous portions and the quality of of the food for the price make this spot unbeatable.  I usually find myself here once a week or so. Location is great as well, right between the University and Northlake areas.",

Occasionally a coworker's order or two has gotten screwed up in our extra large office lunch orders, but the owners have always made it right if we called and told them.  They have the cheapest salmon entree anywhere!  I would request it medium rare to avoid the possibility of getting an over cooked piece of salmon.  It only happened to me once or twice.  Typically it does come out perfect.  I do wish they had a side of lo mein noodles for my picky toddler.   I end up ordering the vegetable noodles with a side of rice so he can get what he wants.  All in all, Toyama is the best quick service Japanese place I have found in the University/Concord area.  They will customize just about any order.  Just ask :)",

I called and put in an order to pickup and when I got there they never heard of me.  Assuming the name was mangled I asked if they had the contents of my order, possibly under another name.  Nothing.  No remorse, trip wasted.  I only took away one star because this only happened once, but I only ever did to-go once.  I will give them another chance.  Choose your meat and choose your vegetable.  That is how great this place is.  They give you plenty of shrimp sauce (glorified mayonnaise sauce) and plenty of food.  I usually don't care for cooked carrots but this place does them well enough that I enjoy them.  I usually get mushrooms or broccoli with beef.  I wish they had more onions in there (either mixed in the fried rice or with your meat).  I haven't asked for extra onions yet so that may be on me.  This place is a good size but don't expect to always get a seat during the lunch rush.  It gets crowded and you may end up eating in your car.  No matter how busy it gets they manage to knock out the food faster than people leave their seats.  This is really a place for locals - it isn't something I would drive across town for.  It is good but you can probably find something closer if you need to.  They just do an excellent job on a very simple concept.",

I even order to go to try and avoid the attitude and dirty looks, but tonight proved me wrong again. Still was treated with disrespect.. beware of the staff... if you guys take any of your reviews serious please consider this one and get some new staff that want to be kind to your customers. It really says a lot about the place on who they hire to be the faces you see right when you walk in... disappointed....",

The carrots are not too mushy, the soy sauce on the rice is not too salty, and the hibachi steak is so good. Shrimp is good too but I usually go with the steak. My wife loves the shrimp though.

It's partially my fault, because I should not have trusted that my order would've been correct. I get all the way home, ready to sit down and enjoy my dinner only to realize it wasn't what I ordered.  I drive all the way back only for the manager to nonchalantly ask if I wanted another order of what I originally ordered. There was no \"we apologize for messing up your order\", \"sorry for any inconvenience we've caused\"...Nothing! At that point I asked for a refund and that was that. I'll save my hard earned coins for a more deserving, customer friendly establishment.",

I've had rice that wasn't even completely cooked!!

That place that you swing through for take out on a busy weeknight, or stop for lunch when you are out running errands?  Toyama is that place for us.  Our standard order is the hibachi chicken or steak (some of us sub the mushrooms out for broccoli).  To me, the sweet carrots are TOO sweet, and I sub broccoli for that, but the kids love them.  Go easy on the shrimp sauce, as it is super high fat/cal, but it is yummy for sure.  Wasn't as fond of the noodles, but I think I have only gotten them once out of the dozens of dishes I have ordered there, so it also could have been an anomaly.  I usually call first (as do many people) and they have our take out order ready and bagged up, and a special line to check you out.  Appreciate that a lot!",

For example, the Hibachi Chicken is about $6. But, it only comes cooked with mushrooms and rice, and a few sweet carrots. If you want any other veggies- like onions, zucchini, or broccoli- it is extra. (A side of Onions and Zucchini runs about $2.50). It should be noted that this place is cook to order, so you don't get the dried out, pre-cooked chicken that is sadly commonplace at many stores in this type of concept.   Super fast service, very clean, very casual. This is not a \"night-out\" Japanese place. But, this is a quick service, reasonably priced restaurant. with good food.",

Everything on the entire menu is good and I could probably eat it everyday. It is your basic Japanese Express restaurant but everything is done well and very fast. Hibachi chicken and steak, teryaki chicken and steak, shrimp, and salmon are among the combination plates to choose from. All combination plates come with rice, carrots and another vegetable depending upon what meat you choose and of course, shrimp sauce. You can substitute zucchini and onions for the carrots if you wish. The sauteed mushrooms are a personal favorite of mine. The appetizers are also very good specifically, the egg rolls and tempura plate. They have outdoor seating as well which I really love. I definitely recommend Toyama for some quick and delicious Japanese food.",

The portion sizes have decreased which is really sad and part of my reason for going back in the first place.

I always bring anyone new in town here because they never mess up and no matter how fancy or basic your palette is, the food is downright enjoyable.   They are always busy but they prepare the food quickly. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food.   All I'm saying is that you have to try it because I could not rave more about this place.   I've had 2 main issues below. But I still love this place.  Cons: 1. They have the habit of closing earlier than the posted time. I've come at 8:50PM before and was told they are closed even though the listed time is 9:30PM. No explanation just \"We're closed.\" Alright then.  2. There is no specific wait area for to-go so if you are taking something to-go you're awkwardly maneuvering around to try your best to not be in everyone's way.",

The chicken and vegetables were cooked perfectly. The side of sweet carrots were simply delicious and very tender. I ordered the steak and chicken combination plate which again was cooked with the right amount of flavor. The food was not greasy or overwhelming covered with sodium.

I ordered jumbo shrimp noodles, an order of wings, and a side of fried rice just to try it out. I love the taste of fried rice, IF it's done correctly in a carbon steel wok.  Apparently the young lady that took my order didn't hear me - or wasn't paying attention - so I received the wings and fried rice I specifically ordered along with an order of jumbo shrimp and 'broccoli' that I DIDN'T order. I specifically told her noodles. But no problem, I didn't say anything and took the order home.  The wings where good, not the best I've ever had, but good. The fried rice was - in my opinion - lackluster at best. It didn't seem to have much of a 'fried rice' taste to me. But that was okay too because after a quick spin in MY carbon steel wok it was much better!  The broccoli, shrimp, and carrots were WAY over cooked. The shrimp were so over cooked in fact not only were they like rubber but the flavor was completely gone. Shrimp are very easy to over cook so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that too.  The carrots apparently were steamed and bland ... BORING!  The little cup of shrimp sauce was okay I guess. Are you're suppose to dip the shrimp in it, or just pour it all over everything to help out since everything seemed to be tasteless?   Will I go back? Absolutely! I'll give a restaurant three chances. I'll chalk this first visit up to them having a bad day. I was told the noodles are suppose to be good. I'll give that a whirl next time. All I can say is that next trip better impress the hell out of me!",

So I asked the girl who was placing my order since I was ordering 2 plates of this to separate the chicken from the rice. She said no then handed the phone to boss lady who said 'we can't do this. When you come,you can separate it yourself.' I explained that I'm getting 2 orders, 2 boxes and if she can separate this for me. She said no we don't so that. So me no order.

We both had shrimp  n scallop with fried rice and mixed veggies- the carrots were so sweet n just the right touch to all the savory happening on our plate.   It's very affordable at $11.99 for our meals and very generous portions.   They have some patio dining and we enjoyed that our first time here. People constantly coming and going so they have a strong carry out game!!!!!  This is a great option for quick, inexpensive generous tasty food!    I ate it so fast I didn't even get a pic",

I hate when I go to a place and it changes on me (portion size, taste, etc.) but not Toyama. I've been trying to stay away from carbs, because if no one has told you--they are the DEVIL! So I usually order the salmon with broccoli and carrots, no rice. Or shrimp with broccoli and carrots, no rice. Or anything...without the rice. The service is quick and it's on my way home from the gym.",

I use to frequent this place a lot while in college because the prices were reasonable. To my knowledge they do not deliver, but the service is REALLY fast. The staff has also always been friendly throughout the years. If you work in the area ( like at Wells Fargo, etc) , you may want to call ahead at lunch because the line is usually out the door , but service is still fast .",

It takes 10 minutes or less to get your plate and the prices are so cheap that you will come back once a week and not realize that you've spent a 1/4 of your food budget on Toyama's. But it's worth it! The employees are always nice and this is def. a favorite of mine in the UNCC area.   The shrimp sauce and the hibachi shrimp are the best I've ever had and you get very generous portions! They also surprisingly have really good sweet tea.   pro tip: If you aren't a fan of the sweet carrots or broccoli you can get extra rice!",

    "text": "My favorite hibachi place in town. I always order the steak hibachi with mushroom (it automatically comes with sweet carrots). It's the cheapest and most delicious hibachi I have ever had (and I am no hibachi fan!!!). This place is ALWAYS ALWAYS crowded so please keep that in mind. Great thing is they have plenty of space inside and outside to accommodate.   The steak hibachi usually costs me a little over $8. While the hibachi is the star, the shrimp sauce is the soul!!!! It is so good that I would buy the 12 oz container so I can eat it with everything at home! I am obsessed. My steak is never overly cooked and always soft. I've ordered both to go and eat-ins and they're both the same amazing quality.   I've had the chicken hibachi too, but it can be dry and tough so I stick to my steak. I've also had the noodles with steak & chicken but honestly, it just tastes and feel like stir fried ramen.   I highly recommend sticking to what they're really good at--which is their hibachi plates--especially the steak! And whatever you order, their shrimp sauce is an absolute must.   Warning FYI---don't come here expecting stellar service because they're more of a fast food + sit in restaurant type of deal. They won't serve you, you order and you wait for your food. You won't have a server, etc. But it's so worth it if you love creamy sauce in your hibachi!",

The steak and chicken are always tender.  The rice and vegetables are fresh.  They will make a dish the way you want so no pre meals made here.   They are very quick.  Because I only wait 5-10 minutes for take out I typically wait until I get there to order so the food it still hot when I get home.    They have tables if you care to eat there.  They don't have table service however.  Someone will call the number on your receipt telling you your order is ready.  Everyone is cordial.    It's a fast food American style Japanese take out restaurant I recommend. Enjoy!",

When you walk in, (if you can walk in and the lines not out the door) you'll goto the register and place your order from a nice sized menu of options.  My personal favorite i la the hibachi beef and broccoli add and extra side of shrimp sauce (does not fast like shrimp) and change the fried rice to steamed.  Just incase your wonder the fried rice is really good I just prefer steamed rice at most places. A little more about this shrimp sauce, if you like sauce you've got to try it.  The sauce is sweet with very little tang at the end and creamy, if you're looking for spice it's not in this sauce but they do have Sriracha. Small place though the is outdoor seating. The location is great and gives you an opportunity to walk off some of your dinner if you want to go grab boba next door or Italian ice about 6 stores down. Hope you enjoy it!",

They didn't even bother to take the side muscles off. I have never been to a restaurant that didn't do this. That was very disappointing. They also only gave 4 and they were overcooked with no flavor. I'll never order the scallops again. On to the steak, I could barely taste the Teriyaki on it, but it was pretty good. The shrimp were ok as well. The veggies weren't too overcooked but cut way too small for my liking, but they tasted good. Everything else was average but edible at least. This will probably be my good to for Japanese until I find better quality.",

The atmosphere is certainly not the Waldorf, but it works for what it is.  There are scattered boring tables in three different sections of the restaurant. A few pieces of Japanese art adorn the walls.  I love the symbols on the bathroom doors.  Check out my picture of the men's restroom door!    Serve yourself on the beverages.  I don't find much different about Japanese restaurants, but when you're in the mood for it (I like the sweetened carrots), this is a great FAST choice.  Today I had the teriyaki chicken with broccoli.  It was exactly what I expected it to be!  They do a lot of take out business and if you eat in, expect the order to be processed at a jiffy speed.  Best of all, for what you get, it is inexpensive.  Give it a go!",

    "text": "A college age friend sang the praises of Toyama, so I gave it a try on a Saturday night. First of all, it was SLAMMED packed with a very diverse group of people of all ages. So that was a good sign. I ordered the hibachi shrimp and broccoli. It was ready in a reasonable time. That being said, it was an average Shrimp and broccoli that you get an any old Japanese restaurant. 4 stars.  I returned about a week later and tried the jumbo shrimp noodles. The shrimp were good, a little overcooked, but nothing shrimp sauce can't fix. My issue was with the noodles. They were salty, dry, and didn't come with any vegetables. I was expecting more of a lo mein. Regardless, the dish underdelivered and I would not order the noodles here again.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this established for over a year now. At first, I was highly satisfied with the food, the service and the value. (see previous review). I would come here OFTEN. So much that the staff knew my face and order over the phone and in person.   When I was all \"hibachied\" out after the spring and decided to diversify my dining options.  Last month, the hankering returned. I've come two previous times and I've noticed the customer service and quality of the food took a nosedive. (I even walked out on my last visit due to the service). I decided to give them in last chance in light of all of the other great visits.   Today I placed a call for pick up. When I called I was immediately asked to be put on hold without the business name even being stated (or stated so quickly it was unintelligible.) I proceeded to remain on hold for 6 minutes. By that time I'd arrived. (As a point of reference: Typically I call 10 minutes prior and am told the order will be ready in 5 minutes and it is hot and waiting upon arrival.)   When I walked in (still on hold) there were two cashiers working, two food runners, two chefs and a guy wandering around behind the counter. There was only one party in front of me. I stepped out, hung up and tried to call again and I was immediately asked to be put on hold. I hung up, stepped back in and wasn't welcomed to the counter but rather nonchalantly waved over as if I were interrupting the cashier's day.  I calmly asked to speak with a manager. The two cashiers didn't respond but just looked around. Finally one asked said to a very young man (the wanderer) who clearly was not the manager, \"She wants to speak with a manager\".    He just looked at me. Never an acknowledgement. I proceeded to explain to him that I'd remained on hold for six minutes.   He just looked at me blankly and said, \"I'm sorry\". No offer of atonement, no empathetic nonverbal cues, nothing. He followed up his lacking apology by asking , \"So would you like to order now?\" At this point I recognized his voice from initial six-minute-hold-call.   Clearly sensing a lack of managerial prowess, I asked again to speak to a manager. Only then did he state that he wasn't in. I told him I wanted to be contacted when he returned and he just said, ok. I then had to prompt him,  to take down my contact info. He pulled a random stack of receipts and began to write the information. I told him that I would be following up later in the week if I didn't hear back.   I ordered and then he stammered, \"I will talk to the rest of the employees about it.\"  This is the third consecutive visit where I've had an issue.  1st: skimpy portion 2nd: clueless response when I asked for extra noodles (and was willing to pay) due to the previous skimpy portion  And this visit.   Let me be clear. I understand that no establishment is perfect. As a former food service employee and customer service manager, I understand that there will be hiccups.   I've been a loyal client in spite of those hiccups:   1) I'd stopped ordering the chicken due to the dry, rubbery texture and switched to the steak.   2) I figured out early on that you have to specify well done onions and mushrooms because in their entrees these vegetables come out barely warm and still raw.   Still I stuck with them because the service was good, the the food is flavorful, portions were ample and the prices are great. Now only half of those statements are True.   I will update my review with the manager's response,  if contacted as promised. However, until this poor customer service is resolved, I will no longer be patronizing this establishment.   For the solution to the problems is this:   Comprehensive customer service training for all employees, including how to handle grievances when they arise.   Good food gets customers in the door but good service transforms customers into patrons.",

    "text": "This is my go to for good fast hibachi in the University area. Whether calling ahead or going inside you won't be waiting long, even during the lunch rush they get you in & out. They have a good menu already but if you want a combination you don't see or to add/subtract anything they will accommodate you. I usually get extra veggies and no rice and there's no up charge. I'm not a fan of shrimp/yum yum sauce but they have a really good ginger/steak sauce that I get instead & it goes great on everything not just the steak. My go to is usually the salmon with mixed veggies which is delicious and less than $10 can't bet that.  The prices and portions are really good. I haven't ate in but there are plenty of tables & on a nice day you can seat on the patio.  There is plenty of parking but also a lot of other restaurants around so you might not get one that closer if the area is really busy.  Server is always great, never had any complaints they are very fast and efficient getting you in and out but will offer you suggestions if you need them.",

I didn't feel like my food was overly greasy, overly salty, or that my vegetables were old, which is the problem I have with most joints like this. Went in with my hubby and he got the hibachi chicken for a whopping  $6! So much food he could barely finish it. I got the shrimp and steak with noodles for about $11. Super fast service too! Both entrees were pretty good, nothing that I would go outta my way to drive for but it is a GREAT spot for someone who lives in the area like me. All in all, it's an awesome alternative for nights I'm too lazy to cook dinner and want a change from Chinese take-out.",

    "text": "Tonight my husband and I took an out of town friend, Sam, to Toyama, and had the most bizarre experience... Sam's order was brought out to her with a side of spring rolls, and without the carrots that usually accompany it. The restaurant was fairly busy and there was a line, so we shrugged it off, and ate one of the spring rolls.   About fifteen minutes later, a server came out and berated us for not returning the spring rolls to the kitchen. Sam explained that she hadn't been there before and didn't know the spring rolls weren't included with her meal; the server repeatedly insisted that we pay for the spring rolls she hadn't ordered. We refused. The server then snatched up the remaining spring roll (with a bite missing) and stormed off.   But she wasn't done with us yet! The same server returned soon after to continue bullying Sam to pay for the spring rolls. Again Sam refused and asked to speak to a manager (conveniently not in tonight.) The server scolded that because of our \"dishonesty,\" another angry customer inside had not received their order.   Choosing not to comment on the fact that we were not responsible for the kitchen correctly filling other customers' orders, I reminded the server that even if Sam returned the spring rolls, it would not have been food safe for them to serve the food she had touched to someone else. To the amusement of the other diners around us, the server continued to argue her point, ending by saying that \"next time\" we should do the honest thing and return the food that had been mistakenly brought to us.   There won't be a next time after the incredibly strange, rude way we were treated. It's a shame; we like the food and have gone to Toyama fairly often -- but there are plenty of other restaurants in town that will not harass their customers for a mistake made by the kitchen.   P.S. Two spring rolls cost $2.60.",

Ordering process was fast and efficient; food came out quickly.  Good value.  Ample seating indoors and out.  Shrimp dish has plenty of shrimp, quite healthful if it weren't for way too much salt.  But I'd still rather eat here than at a a faceless chain restaurant with stamped out food.",

    "text": "This little place seems to be very popular as it's always busy and full during lunch and dinner hours. Atmosphere wise it's definitely more of a place you would go to for the food, not the setting. It's always clean and it's not really that loud, but interior design wise it's very simple. Which isn't a bad thing if you're just looking to go in for a quick meal (and the food really does come out super quick) but I wouldn't go there for date night or a night out with friends.  Food is good and the dish sizes are big so I always end up leaving with a box of leftovers.  Price is right too and they also have a counter for take out customers. Most of the people working there are nice but I have had a couple of instances where I've soon regretted tipping them (you tip them before you get the food while ordering the food at the counter). There's one lady who comes off as grumpy and whenever she serves me it rubs off on me too..but that could also be the language barrier between us, as she doesn't seem to speak english very well.. But I go there for the food, so that hasn't bothered me enought to stop me from going back there.  My favorite dish is hibachi shrimp with broccoli. The hubby likes their hibachi steak with mushrooms.",

This place is hands down one of the best fast habachi places i've been to.  Here are a couple of reasons  1) You get quite a lot of food for the amount of money you pay! ( I have yet to finish a whole plate of food) 2) The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. 3) One of the best tasting quick habachi places 4) A lot of variety.    There isn't much to say about this place that i haven't already listed out.  I'd come here all the time if i still lived in Charlotte  TIP: You can pretty much swap out your vegetables and carrots for other veggies.",

Around $6 for a typical standard dinner and ready within 2-3 minutes.  Shrimp sauce is the best of any Japanese restaurant I've found. Sweet but not too heavy. Always have more food than I can finish. Not much has changed over the years, that's probably why I still stop in if I'm in the area.",

It is right down the road from us so its a great place to stop by on a night you just don't feel like firing up the stove to slave over a meal after a long day's work.   We have had both entrees with rice and noodles and love both. I would recommend this place to those who love Sogo in Concord. This place is just as good and slightly less expensive. Always have had great service.  Toyama Express is our go-to spot when craving some delicious Japanese hibatchi. Give it a try for yourself.",
