Every one was delicious. The short ribs and grits were perfect. The pork belly melted in my mouth with just the right amount of crunch! The pimento cheese and pretzels was so tasty I could have eaten the whole thing, luckily we were sharing :-) Brussels were on point and we got the strawberry cheesecake for dessert. I am normally not a sweets person but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. This place has great prices. The food tastes amazing and the service was excellent! We will definitely be back soon. We want to try the breakfast and brunch!",

Also had the squash soup with pumpkin seeds and a bit of fig jam. So good. Everything is farm to fork and they list farms used on their chalkboard.   Service was attentive and food was served on time.  Will def be back.  Can't wait to try dinner there.",

The pimento cheese and bacon jam went perfectly with the flavorful beef.  This doesn't come with a side so we got fried brussel sprouts as a side and they were outstanding!

    "text": "I passed the Flipside Cafe while getting ice cream next door on a Saturday and I'd never noticed it before so I came home and checked the yelp reviews.  They got rave reviews so I got up the following Sunday morning and was excited to share my new brunch discovery with my husband and roommate.    We got there at 11:15am trying to avoid the church folks.  I was surprised that there were only 2 other tables when we arrived.  (I would later figure out why)  It was a lot smaller than I anticipated, and it was kinda warm due to the crazy tall ceiling and the kitchen that's open to the dining area.?.  There were far more employees than customers and though the employees all seemed young and \"hip\" they were also very polite and efficient.  Ok, now the food.  It seems to be local focused and the items we ordered were indeed tasty.  I gave a 2 star solely based on the price, not on the taste.  I knew this place was going to be more expensive than we're used to paying for eggs and toast, but WOW!  We got 2 of their Benne! Benne! and they were both very tasty, but both very small.  Imagine: one English muffin, 2 poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and some crispy, flash sauteed asparagus for $9...  with no side or drink.  Really?  There is no \"side\" with this which I was really surprised by.  I ordered some of their $5 Carolina grits just so we could taste them as they'd gotten great reviews... and OMG! They are the best grits EVER!  They come in a sizzling square cast iron skillet.  Maybe not worth $5.00, but pretty darn good :-)  My roommate ordered 2 eggs over medium and bacon.  He got simply 2 eggs and some bacon... no toast, no side.  He drank coffee (which was $3!) while we both ordered cokes.  I was shocked to get a 20 oz bottle and a glass with ice, and was even more shocked to be charged $2.00 each for them!!  The plates they use are cute, but they're slightly rounded so cutting anything on them without them falling over and making a mess is nearly impossible.  I found this to be a real issue with my Benne! Benne! that needed to be cut into bite sized pieces :-(  My fellas were not at all impressed with The Flipside Cafe; they were still hungry when we left so we stopped at Bojangles on our way home so they could get more breakfast.  Our food from The Flipside Cafe was all very tasty, but not enough of anything and all very overpriced for what you actually get.  Our bill was $43 at the end and I tipped the waitress well because she was enjoyable and efficient, but for $50 I expect to leave full and satisfied, maybe even having had a bloody mary :-(  I'm sad to say that though it was all tasty, we will not be back.",

We were a bit skeptical as it sounded a bit different but WOW, what a great appetizer and it arrived piping hot in a small little personal skillet.  I ordered a salad with chicken, goat cheese, sweet corn, bacon and avocado.  It was outstanding and so fresh.  My husband had a roasted turkey sandwich which was delicious.  Everything was so fresh and the service was outstanding although the restaurant was packed.  A MUST visit if you're in the area.",

We were on our way to Roanoke from Savannah and made a stop based on reviews, and I gotta say the place blew my expectations away.   At first I was somewhat surprised at a relatively small menu but I realized this is how they make each dish shine. The ingredients are locally sourced and everything is made from scratch, even the hot chocolate! I ordered an Eggs Benedict and it was out of this world. My dad ordered the Maine lobster omelet not expecting much lobster, but we found giant chunks of the good stuff! Brother ordered a waffle with a side of eggs. The smells emanating from the kitchen were mouthwatering. Service was fast and friendly. Pricing was reasonable. 10/10.",

The food is amazing and an extremely good value for the quality. $3 mimosas on Sunday which is amazing. Jerri is AWESOME, we always sit at the bar now because of her. She always remembers what we want and is super fun to talk to. Everyone at The Flipside works really hard to make sure their patrons have a great experience. Ambiance is cool, the bar side of the restaurant has a chill vibe. My only wish is that they would open up more locations,  Ballantyne or South Park maybe? I will continue coming back and you should too!",

While the cafe is in a strip mall, once you are inside, the restaurant is charming decorated in a modern farmhouse style.  All four of us ordered something different for dinner and everyone loved their dinner choice. Loved that this place uses locally sourced vendors.  Our server Jerri was very attentive and adorable.  She helped make our evening fun!  Can't wait to go back to try the brunch menu!",

But it comes with all that fresh fruit that we wanted in a beautiful metal e and my chicken and waffle was the tenders chicken in the nicest waffle and the most beautiful presentation one could ask for. If you're within a hundred miles this is the place to go. Now we came in a little before noon and we were able to sit down right away by the time we left there was 20 people outside the door just hoping they could be next to get on in there. This place is popular and the reason it's popular is cuz it's good good good. If you get a chance this one is worthwhile. And this one should definitely be in the Yelp top 100 for breakfast",

    "text": "Amazing.  That's how we and our guests felt about Flipside catering our wedding a few weeks ago.  Ashley was amazing to work with from the start.  We wanted some really cool passed hor d'oeuvres to start, a more non-traditional wedding dinner menu and some passed out late night snacks.  They delivered!  We had pork belly, shrimp and sweet potato options at the start, some carolina crab cakes, sliders, truffle fries, sweet potato gnocchi, chicken pesto pasta, two types of salad served in stemless martini glasses and several other really cool options for dinner.  Around 9pm, they passed out a late night snack - chicken and waffles/syrup in these little cones - our guests LOVED them!  I cannot say enough how great the overall food experience was and how easy they were to work with, both before, during after after the tasting.  The other thing Flipside provided was the bar service since our vendor allowed us to provide our own alcohol.  The bartenders were amazing - the guests were all raving about how friendly they were, their 'heavy pours' and how fast they were.  They made special drinks for my mom and aunt and were hugging them by the end of the night - the personal touch could not have been any better.  Every staff member that came the day of the wedding was friendly, professional and really interacted so well with all of our guests.  If you are looking for a local catering option and want to steer clear of those big commercial catering companies - I HIGHLY recommend that you check out Flipside - you won't be disappointed!",

No Sir, it is not.  I ordered the garden squash bisque which is a flavorful butternut and apple puree. It is  garnished with kale, bacon and fig balsamic. I also ordered the white bean hummus which came with baguette toasts coated in olive oil, salt and herbs.  If you want a glass of wine or a beer, they offer lots of local choices.  The service was very good and the servers worked well with the folks who had to wait for a table even offering to seat people \"communally.\"   If there is any negative for me it would be that almost all menu selections include bacon, ham or cheese. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it is somewhat difficult to find a light dish. The white bean hummus was fine but the toasts were very rich with the oil. What I ordered sound \"light-ish\" but I went away feeling like I had eaten a lot of fat.  I will definitely return - I love the emphasis on local ingredients.",

Soon as we opened the door we were amazed how crowded it was for lunch and the people just kept coming in.  It's a small place packed with tables.   I ordered the pot roast paninni with was amazing.   I saw some other dishes as well that looked great,  shepherd's pie, and the burgers.   The staff was very friendly after I ate the waitress showed me the bathroom and she actually help me unzip my pants, I couldn't believe it.   JUST KIDDING!!!!!!, just wanted to see if you where actually reading this entire review.   It was a very good lunchtime experience,  I will definitely be back to sample some other plates.",

    "text": "Amazing! This was definitely some of the best southern comfort food I've ever had! We went here about a week ago. It's a small cafe and is normally packed so I suggest you make a reservation. First, we got a delicious baguette with strawberry and regular homemade butter. We also got the BEST brussel sprouts that I have ever had. We then got a delicious wedge salad with blue cheese dressing and lots of toppings. The final dish was the salmon entree that came with spinach and autumn vegetables. Also, the service was good because our waitress checked on us often, but the highlight and best part of the meal of course had to be the........ bacon.",

The wait staff was friendly and efficient. As it was our first time made suggestions. We each tried something different one thing better than the next. The house favorite was the chicken and waffles with a maple bacon chutney on top. OMG was it good. Came back on Monday and the menu was different ( not brunch). My son really wanted the Chicken and Waffles but it was not on the menu. We asked our waitress, she checked with the kitchen and they happily accommodated us. The owner came to our table to check in and welcome us to both the restaurant and the area. This will be a favorite spot for us! Can't wait to come back.",

Clue #1: there's something happening here that's worth waiting in line  About 5 months ago they expanded into the store next door practically doubling their footprint.  Includes a nice counter with about a dozen stools plus plenty of tables, too.  Clue #2:  they are expanding to meet the demand.  I ordered the Flipside Cafe breakfast special.  $10 dollars gets you a sampler of Southern classics--a biscuit and gravy, two eggs cooked to order, strips of bacon, and cheesy grits.  The gravy was more like a tangy bechemel meets hollandaise.  Excellent riff on sausage gravy.  Coffee is from Counter Culture out of Asheville, NC.  Perfect.  Clue #3:  they prefer to think out of the box and deliver exceptional food at reasonable prices.  Still clueless as to why you're missing out?  Hmmm.  Clue #4:   \"Give 'em a Whirl.\"",

    "text": "I woke up Sunday morning craving a chicken waffle and knew exactly where to go - the Flipside Cafe! Located a mile from Carowinds on the NC/SC border, this popular farm to table breakfast and lunch joint is normally packed with locals. This was my third visit for breakfast and it was very good each time.   I have now tried their top three breakfast sellers - the Lobster Omelet, Chicken Waffle and Shrimp & Grits - and they were all very tasty but the Chicken Waffle has become my favorite. It arrived sandwiched between two waffle triangles and topped with two slices of slab bacon. The chicken was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. An unspectacular fruit salad rounded out the dish that didn't seem freshly prepared. At $10 though this dish is a pretty good deal and one I'll order again.  The Lobster Omelet is delicious and a close second to the chicken. It has chunks of Maine lobster and loaded with other good stuff. It appeared to be the morning's biggest hit based upon our neighboring tables.   Upon first bite, the Shrimp and Grits are fantastic. Consisting of several large shrimp resting upon their housemade cheesy grits and topped off with spinach and crumbled chorizo sausage, it is much bolder than the typical versions that can be somewhat bland. However, halfway through, my palate became somewhat overwhelmed by the high salt content. To me, it's one of those dishes that are a great for the first few bites but quickly become tiring. Still its popularity alone says all you need to know.  The pimento cheese grits at $5 are exceptional and are a must. If it's biscuits that you want though, do yourself a favor and go to the Bojangles down the street, as the biscuits here are fair at best.  The coffee is decent and topped off faithfully but, at 3 bucks, it's hard to pass on a latte or a cappuccino. The newly added dining area provides great atmosphere. It was very tight before. Service is okay, but in our experience here, the young staff spends too much time chatting among themselves and not enough time waiting on customers.  Overall, I have to rate this joint 4 stars and a Gotta Try!",

We arrived approx 5 mins before the 9 AM open and were promptly seated.    Ordered the Morning Glory which was one of the surprise muffins offered that day.  OMG it was served cut in half and warmed perfectly.  A nice treat which was shared by our party of 3.   Next up my son who is 8 ordered from the adult menu the chicken and waffles which came with fruit and bacon. The waffle was one of ghee best i have tasted and the chicken cooked wonderfully and lightly battered.  For me it could have used some salt however one could always add a dash if preferred.  My son devoured it .   My wife and I split the lobster omelette and ordered a side of potatoes which were served in a skillet and we were satisfied. It was delish and I could see a big piece of lobster meat in there.  Overall we were pleased with our meal and the service and will def be back.  Already told some folks about the restaurant.",

Nice chucks of Tasso (Cajun bacon), tomatoes, and peppers. The shrimps were nice size also.   I had the everything bagel with salmon and arugula sandwich with side of fruits. Both were good. The fruits consisted of strawberries, pineapples, melon and blueberries. The cured salmon, just right amount, pared well with the pickled red onion and arugula.   Coffee, freshly grounded, topped of the breakfast just right.   Recommend this place. I will definitely drive all the way here again. Bonus, gas cheaper in SC.",

We we're seated almost immediately at 11am on a Sunday and that by itself was impressive enough. Tracy was our waitress and did a good job considering how busy the kitchen was. She was very patient and helped me figure out what I wanted to order and helped me customize my dish which was phenomenal. I had the hash and a half portion of the Carolinas grits, my boyfriend had the chicken and waffles. The half portion of the Carolinas grits was the perfect size. That bacon jam might have been my favorite part of my entire meal. I would use it as a condiment on more dishes than just grits. The hash was good. The pieces of potato we're HUGE. I would've preferred them smaller with a bigger vareity of veggies in it. My boyfriend said the waffle was actually the best waffle he'd ever had. I would definitely come back!",

    "text": "The small, unassuming cafe is a True hidden gem! At my age, it is rare that I have what I consider to be a \"taste sensation,\" but this special little place gave me more than one on this visit.  My wife and I ate there for Sunday brunch this past weekend. The food was some of the best breakfast food that I've had in many years. I had the Maine Lobster Omelet with a side of bacon. My wife had the yogurt with granola and fresh fruit.  Taste sensation #1...In all honesty, the omelet wasn't what I was expecting. Rather than being filled with a creamy seafood sauce, there were many textures that you could literally taste. There was enough cheese in the omelet to make it creamy, but the lobster and asparagus are what set the dish apart. The lobster was plentiful and tasty, and the asparagus was fresh and crunchy, but not overpowering.  Taste sensation #2...The bacon.....I don't know where to start singing its praise. It was thick cut, had a very smoky taste, but was cooked to perfection. It was easily some of the best bacon I've ever had.  Taste sensation #3...The final success was the coffee. I apologize for not remembering the name, but it was a locally roasted grind that they use (call Amy...she can give you all the details). This was rich and full flavored, but without a single hint of bitterness or bite that is so typical of most coffee. I always drink my coffee with cream, but this coffee literally does not need cream. It was very smooth. I plan to bring some home when I'm back in the area.  My wifes yogurt was also very good, and the fresh fruit was the perfect compliment.  When I left, I shared with the owner that I was truly sad that I had to stop eating. It was a dining experience that will not be forgotten anytime soon.",

I tasted his omelet and thought it was ordinary, I've had much better!  Coffee was a little watery and not strong.  And I am giving this spot two stars especially because of the service.  One of the waitresses was trying to seat a table behind me and rudely decided to scoot me in my chair at the table so the little kids behind me can sit down, she didn't ask nicely or say excuse me.  I was so crunched in my seat that my husband had to move the whole table back.  She then came by and only asked him if he wanted a refill, so obviously she had some problem.  I felt a little uncomfortable eating at this place...probably will not be returning.",

I ordered the $5 buck special; in essence the Flipside Cafe breakfast; scrambled eggs, grits and biscuit with a delicious gravy. I also ordered a side of thick cut bacon, simply amazing. After multiple visits, I found something to suggest they need to improve (extremely rare @ Flipside)..gravy for the biscuit was very cold, suggestion; needs to be very hot to compliment the delicious biscuit. It's a small thing anyway. The flavors on that gravy was like going to heaven and back. Not that I have gone there, but you catch my drift.   I know that I'm a fan, but this is such a special place. If I could only put them in my suitcase and take them home to Miami. Oh well, more reasons to return here. As always superb customer service, nice job Taelor!!

My husband's food came out before mine, because my \"eggs were still working.\" When my Eggs Benedict came out, it was SWIMMING in hollandaise. I mean, it could have spilled over the lip of the plate. I soon realized why-to cover the completely uncooked eggs underneath. Even after asking for a plate and scooping off the salvageable parts of the dish, the servers didn't choose to notice the total mess that I was served. I was embarrassed to even say anything, so I didn't. I even noticed another Benedict come out of the kitchen with light scoops of sauce on either poached egg. The way it should be.  If it doesn't come out of the kitchen correctly, an employee should intercept. Bottom line, there are too many good breakfast places in the Charlotte area to bother with a spot like this. Womp.",

I love them because they are local and support local farms I love them because they are no frills--just solid food, friendly service I love them because they serve beer, wine and coffee I love them because they have fresh ingredients, made to order (finally a place that asked how we wanted our burgers cooked which = NOT FROZEN) I love them because they have a white bean hummus served with local bread, lightly sprinkled with butter that makes you want to backflip.  We had a party of 4 and ended up ordering 2 because it was that good. I love them because they are reasonably priced I love to love them.  They have great menu options from soups to salads, burgers to meatloaf, desserts, etc.  We tried the turkey chili, flipside salad (avacado, bacon, roasted chicken, blue cheese, citris/vinegar dressing), pimento cheese burgers and of course the white bean hummus.  We didn't try the desserts but I will say we saw apple pie a la mode being served to a neighboring table and it looked divine!

    "text": "If I lived in Fort Mill, The Flipside would be my go-to morning spot.  Locally sourced ingredients always get a thumbs up from me.  Onward...to the food:  Buscuit and gravy.  I've had better buscuits, but the gravy was out of this world.  I wish I could remember the type of sausage they used in the gravy, but it tastes similar to an Andouille gravy.    The grits were like no grits I've ever had.  I wouldn't have known they were grits if they weren't labeled as grits.  These were the cheesiest I've ever had...and they had the consistancy of mashed potatoes or a thick rice.  Very, very, very tasty.  The bacon is a bit different than the store bought bacon I'm used to.  Good, but different.  The eggs are really where The Flipside wins me over.  I normally like my eggs over-easy, but decided to take a stab at their scrambled.  Making an over-easy egg is easy...but scrambling eggs is an artform.  They nail em here.  Slowly cooked on low heat and not overcooked.  A+  The inside is a handful of tables and a couple of taller ones with stools.  Nothing all that exciting, but it's tastefully decorated and the simplicity is what makes it so nice.  It's small, but not a hole-in-the-wall.    Try:  Everything I mentioned (the meatless chorizo is pretty nice too)",

    "text": "BRUNCH: The Patatas Bravas and the appetizer grits (with pimento cheese and bacon jam) were two of the best items I've eaten in a long time. The potatoes were beautifully crispy, perfectly seasoned and the herbed creme fraiche was literally icing on top. I don't particularly care for grits, but these are no ordinary grits. They're light and fluffy with body like nice mashed potatoes. No drippy, runny grits here. The flavor was superb as well. If only I'd stopped there...  The brunch entrees were a bit underwhelming. After the amazing appetizer potatoes, the SOY CHORIZO POTATO HASH was disappointing. While it was perfectly adequate, the potatoes weren't nearly as good as of as the Patatas Bravas.  And the 2 sunny side up eggs were cooked through (not runny yellow, as sunny side up indicates).   The BENE BENE eggs were also overcooked (solid all the way through), and the asparagus was a bit dried out (maybe also overcooked?).   Despite the lackluster entrees, the appetizers would have been enough for a 5 star review, except for two problems.  1) there were not enough servers to adequately serve the amount of patrons, resulting in significantly substandard service.  Our server was very nice, when he was at our table. But somehow my water was always empty and it was 15 minutes before we'd see him the next time. Which is weird, because the restaurant is so small that I could see him whenever I looked, but I think he was too busy to make it to our table regularly.   2) the biggest problem was the temperature in the restaurant. It was exactly the same inside as outside, and it was at least 85 out. I read this in a previous review, so I know it wasn't unique to our experience. I was literally sweating down my face by the time entrees came. I had the server immediately box up my entree so I could get out as quickly as possible. I could've overlooked all of the other issues and strongly recommended this place based on our appetizers, but the heat was too much.  Owners: please turn up the a/c for a more enjoyable experience.",

Eggs were cooked great, the grits where savoy and not overly salty, and the sausage gravy had great flavor, not bland like some can be. To top it off their bacon is awesome. Thick cut, and not to salty or greasy.  The guy got the BLT, delicious! The arugula & mayo were perfect. Also the coffee is on point!  Look forward to the next time.",

They use as much local and fresh ingredients as possible.  The potatoes are incredible. The pretzels and pimiento cheese is not of this world, an angel comes down from the heavens to supply The Flipside Cafe with the ingredients (I'm about 95% sure of that). It really needs to come with more pretzels though, it only comes with 2. I'm leaving a full 5 stars though in hopes that this review will be read and next time I'm there it will come with at least 3.  This is honestly an amazing restaurant though, everyone must try it.",

What a deal for a simple meal\".  Let me explain why a three-star v. four:  Salt!  There was so much large grain salt on everything that it made eating, let alone tasting, very difficult.  Our hope is that this is an isolated incident and I will amend when we return...soon.  Chef:  pls check your prep in the kitchen and monitor the amount of salt.  Fried potatoes were nicely seared chunks, but we had to scrape off the salt.  Ditto the wonderful sausage gravy over biscuits. How frustrating to realize the savory flavors, the best such gravy I have had in years, but the salt overload prevented us from wolfing it all down.  But I digress...   This is an unassuming cafe, now restaurant opened by a chef couple who had worked at one of Charlotte's top restaurants.  The menu and ingredients reflect their exposure to more gourmet delights.  They serve Breakfast, lunch and dinner with some items carrying over from the previous menu.  I had the lobster omelet...really!  Made with sweet sauteed onions, cheese and asparagus.  What a treat for an early morning wake-up breakfast.  Cinnamon crunch waffle with bananas was like pastry.  Another treat.  And the eggs are made to order and they do an excellent sunny side up version.  Ask to look at the lunch and dinner menus as just reading the offerings will seduce you into returning to try.  We are anxious to return in the hopes that the salting is left more to the consumer than the kitchen.    Flipside is special and worth your exploration.",

    "text": "So, we start d with the White Bean Hummus and it was glorious. It was served with sliced toasted French baguettes and an array of vegetable from sliced cucumbers to Watermelon Radishes, spot on those radishes. With being being a somewhat hummus snob is was a bit skeptical but when I paired it with the WR I was hooked. A perfect start to the meal. I choose the Fortmill Bacon wrapped meatloaf, I'll let that sink in..................... I KNOW, RIGHT. How can you go wrong with bacon. Well... they didn't it was spectacular not only that it had shrooms, man... SHROOMS. Melted in my mouth and the flavors were jumping off in every direction. The just salty enough gravy, the not-to-dry hamburger, the local mushrooms, oh yeah the BACON. I mean how have I been eating and making meatloaf wrong all my life? I Blame ISIS. Anyway, the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious as were the string beans. Our waitress, although it was slow, was VERY attentive and helpful. She steered me into the BWM as appose to choosing the Beef On Wick, which looked scrumptious. It is however not the cheapest place and it's location a bit disappointing. It's a small strip mall next to a pizza place. Patio seating would be nice and lucky we were there when it was light out. I feel that if it were dark outside, it might not be that different inside. I could see how it might be dark when having to rely on the lights there. It is cozy and could fall under the \"Romantic\" category. Too full from Neal to venture into \"Dessert Desert,\" sorry. The reason we chose this place was because the Yelp Cover Photo was a Belgian waffle so I was stomach-minded for Breakfast for dinner, which as we all know is my \"Death Row\" meal, but alas it was not to be. I will return. Eat, Drink, & Tell",

Conveniently  we were the next ones to be seated. I ordered a mimosa, my friend ordered a coffee and a Diet Coke. Her drinks got there, mine didn't. The table beside us had 4 people, who were seated about 10 minutes after us. They got all 4 of their mimosas and I had to ask for mine again. They had the same waitress.   I honestly can't say that I'd come back.",

    "text": "Move over Toast. I found my new favorite breakfast spot. The hubby was taking me to breakfast and he wanted Waffle House. I wanted something different and spotted Flipside Cafe. We thankfully decided to try it out.   I love the ambiance of Flipside. It's casual, but also a little upscale and modern. And It's not as noisy as other restaurants we've been to so we can actually hear each other talk. And service is great. Seating was no problem and our server was friendly.   The menu has a lot of comfort food with Southern accents. They also use locally sourced ingredients. I wanted to try so many things. I landed on a soy chorizo hash and the hubby chose my second choice the Fort Mill biscuit breakfast bake. When the food came out, my eyes widened. Mine came in a beautiful wide bowl and the portion was huge. His came in a small cast iron skillet and a side of fresh fruit. My hash was topped with two overeasy eggs. When I cut into the egg, it dripped onto the hash. And there's nothing sexier than that. The hash was flavorful and I loved the spices in the soy chorizo. I wish there was a little more peppers and onions because they were crisp and delicious.  I couldn't finish, but took the rest home along with a coffee to go. The biscuit bake was also tasty. It was everything I love about breakfast in one dish: fluffy biscuits, bacon, cheese and gravy, topped with eggs.   We've decided this will be our new breakfast spot. And I can't wait to try them for lunch or dinner.",

My nephew had the Mac and cheese sloppy Joe's and he loves it. So all in all it's a win. I would love to go back for brunch though",

I honestly can't wait to return and further explore the menu. We were beyond pleased. It's refreshing to find something new, especially when it's so wonderful. We sat at the bar for our brunch and our server was the best! Jerri, was so attentive and made sure we always had everything we needed. She's the sweetest and excellent at her job!!! All of the staff had the best flow about them. It was clear that they all work together as a team. Owners are definitely doing something right! You guys must go! You'll thank me!",

It the gravy seemed to have a little too much grease included in the roux. The coffee was strong which is a big win.   Overall a great little find. It was a good value in more than one way, we were able to skip lunch it was so filling.",

The dishes we ordered lacked flavor. The chicken and waffles looked appealing but the taste was bland, chicken tenders that were on the waffles had no flavor and the waffle itself lacked a tinge of sweetness without having to put maple syrup on it. I could taste the smokiness of the bacon and it was cooked perfectly but the flavor was still lackluster. The potatos bravas looked promising but this too in the end lacked the flavor I expected from the name.  I think it's great they use locally sourced food but in the end I want my food to have complexity that I can't make better at home. If you like your food really simple in flavor as long  the ingredients are locally sourced, then this is a fine place for you. If you crave locally sourced food but insist on being wowed... skip The Flipside.",

But that's where it all ended. To start with the coffee was not good at all. However, I have been places that the coffee wasn't good, the food was. Well, not here. We ordered the Carolina grits, it has pimento cheese topped with a bacon jam. That was suppose to come out first, it didn't. I had the lobster omelette, it was extremely dry and cooked to the point that I had to actually use my knife to cut the omelette! Yikes!  The fruit side looked straight out of the plastic container you get at the grocery store. My friend had the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were poached well, the sauce was cold. The asparagus side was so salty you couldn't eat it. Our coffees went unfilled for most of the meal, which was ok, the water was much better. Then the pimento cheese grits came out. I tasted white cheddar with two pimentos thrown on top. That bacon jam? I tasted vinegar there. And salt was freely placed on all these dishes, I wondered if perhaps the shaker just fell in the food while they were cooking?  The restaurant is cute though! I don't think I will return here, I will now stop by a coffee shop for some coffee.  I have to amend this, the owner contacted me and would like for me to return. I will most certainly do that, everyone has an off day.",

On one of my friends Salmon dish, she could t find potatoes and had lots of artichoke hearts.  The other one had all potatoes and no artichoke hearts. I left a good part of my food and cane home and half a peanut butter sandwich.  Let me say once again, this isn't the Flipside that I have grown to love and one if their frequent customers.

The place is small and doesn't look like much as you pull up, but don't let the outside perception fool ya. From the time we walked in we were greeted with great hospitality. I could tell early on that we were in for a great experience and they delivered something even better... something we call a \"red shoes experience.\"  We arrived late in the evening not long before closing, but the staff was gracious and never showed any signs of it being an inconvenience. In fact, they went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to make sure we got the full experience. What a rare treat! They made sure we became guests for life!  The food was phenomenal. We started with the pimento cheese and pretzels as well as the short ribs and grits. Wasn't sure they could be topped and then the meatloaf showed up. Then we capped it off with some amazing dessert.   Great job by the entire team!!! See you again real soon!",

The waffle melted in your mouth and the fried chicken breast was divine!  And that biscuit was fluffy with just the right amount of salt. Hot, delicious coffee!  We will be back.",

Kind of a diner vibe, but the service was great (shout out to Sylvia who took great care of us) and the food was incredible. It's hard to rate breakfast food because anyone and their brother can cook an egg. Their omelet was one of the best I have ever had and I had a biscuit covered with cheese and topped with an over-easy egg and it was to die for!!! I'll be back again soon and will tell all my friends!!!",

So, we figured since it was listed as a \"brunch\" place we thought we'd check it out. We arrive just before 12 and was given the lunch/dinner menu. Since he wanted breakfast, he inquired about possibly getting breakfast although it clearly was lunch time, surprisingly enough they agreed and accommodated!! For $7, he had the breakfast plate with a biscuit and gravy, scrambled eggs, bacon and grits and loved every bit of it!! For $12, I ordered the \"bigger portion\" salmon meal and also enjoyed every bit of it!!   Why the four stars you ask, if they accommodated and we enjoyed?? The salmon portion was so small, I was still hungry after finishing it and I'm a pretty petite gal...4'11 130lbs so you can imagine how small that portion was BUT, all in all, if back in the area, we'd DEFINITELY go again!!! Delish!!",

It was served with fresh seasonal fruit, but it really needed a biscuit or some toast. Next time, I'll have something else.  $3 for coffee. I did get my money's worth drinking about four cups.

    "text": "I really like what this place had to offer. They had a great family atmosphere, and the food was delicious. I took the family last night and it was horrible. The menu was limited as always, but I respected that in the past. The selections were always prepared with care and the utmost detail, but tonight it was bad. I know they use a lot of pork products but literally nearly everything on the menu had bacon or pork infused in it. I could at least get shrimp & grits with soy chorizo in the past. The lamb duo which I asked for well because I know they would cook it medium well if I asked for well was still pretty red in the middle. Pink I can do but red and bloody I don't. The lemonade which used to be fresh squeezed was Minute Maid and it was gross. Our waiter while nice was just okay. (Not a first with the subpar wait staff- waited 15 minutes once trying to pay a check). The Alfredo was over cooked and bland. My boys fell asleep waiting. My only good comment comes from the waiter or busboy from Florida who greeted us with a smile and helped to package my food when he saw both my kiddos sleeping and it would have been a hassle to do it myself. He wasn't my waiter, but honestly, he was nicer and more accommodating than our own waiter. I have tried to like this place. It had everything I liked about a local eatery, fresh local ingredients, close by, nice quaint atmosphere, but perhaps breakfast and brunch is the way to go here. Dinner just wasn't hitting on much at all.",

    "text": "We came in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and overall we had a good experience. We had to wait a bit for a table, it would have been less of a wait but the hostess was doing a whole bunch of things at one time so it took her a bit to get the table ready. She even seated people while in the middle of cleaning our table, would have made more sense to ask them to wait one moment seat us, then seat the newcomers. Anyways, the menu is a pretty classic brunch menu with quite a few interesting options. I got the BLT which was tasty, but the bacon wasn't very crispy which made the sandwich hard to eat. My cousin ordered the cinnamon waffle, it was a waffle with a pile of cinnamon toast crunch on it. The menu said cinnamon crunch on it but not cinnamon toast crunch so we weren't just expecting a pile of cereal! We were so shocked by it we didn't realize until half way through that the waffle was missing the spiced bananas! Once we tracked down the waitress she did send the manager on over who was very nice about the whole thing and apologized and took $2 off of the bill. If the bananas would have been on it with their tasty spiced sauce it would have softened the cereal and made a lot more sense. Our other friend got the chicken and waffles and really enjoyed it. The grits were quite tasty as well! Overall a good spot for brunch just a few kinks need to be worked out.",

All 3 times I have gone here have been for breakfast and it is just disappointing.  This time was a weekday and the menu was a little lacking.  I ordered a 2 egg omelet with spinach, tomato and feta.  No feta was available so I went with cheddar.  Also requested whole wheat toast.  I received an omelet  much larger than 2 eggs  and with 3 small tomatoes,(spinach was perfect)  and white toast that was barely toasted.  So the food was not up to my standards or what I ordered.  My other criticism is the decor or messiness.   They need some help with this.  Seats are not comfortable or inviting, all of the counters are just messy and need or organization.  Walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright.   So the decor has always made me avoid going there for a nice dinner.",

We started with the gnocchi appetizer. The pork belly was awesome but only one small piece. The rest of the dish was a little bland, not much flavor. Can tell the gnocchi are homemade and fresh. I got the short ribs which were great, very tender. The pimento bread pudding was ok, I traded with my husband as I thought the mashed potatoes were better. He got the meatloaf which he liked. I would say overall everything was good but not great. With a glass of wine and one beer was about $70 with tip. Would return to try more. Service was ok but our waitress was awkward and not sure why.",

However, we had a perfectly pleasant meal and found the waitstaff attentive and friendly.  When we arrived there were plenty of tables available and we were told to sit wherever we wanted. Our waitress came within moments to let us know what kind of beverages were available.  We spent a minute or two looking at the brunch menu and when the waitress came back with our drinks, we placed our order.  The food was out in quick order.  I had the poached eggs while my husband had the grits and gravy biscuits.  All of the food was delicious and cooked to perfection - the pimento grits, in particular, were creamy and wonderful.  The waitress was very friendly and came by to check on us a couple times while we ate, refilling my husband's coffee each time.  Don't be fooled by it's humble location (in a strip mall) - it's good food at decent prices!  We will definitely be going back to try the place for dinner.",

    "text": "Located in a *very* nondescript strip mall just over the South Carolina border, The Flipside Cafe is an ode to incredible, local food, good service, and excellent prices. To put it another way: oh my Jebus, this place is unfuckinbelievably awesome!   The first thing you may notice upon walking into the airy, light-filled interior is the giant chalk board listing all of the local suppliers for their food. The Flipside seems to be truly dedicated to the craft of local restaurateuring (I know that's not a word... eh, screw it). When we walked in at 11:00 on a Sunday, the folks behind the counter were already busy preparing lunch: they were chopping large quantities of local farm-grown veggies, making the dough for savory pastries from scratch, etc.  The Sunday Brunch menu is both extensive and varied. Being the indecisive schmuck that I am, I ended up ordering \"The Flipside,\" which was really a sampler of their classic southern breakfast. How good could this be, you ask? Fuckin' stupid good, dude. So stupid good, it should ride the short bus of epicness. The eggs were fried in just the right amount of butter to make them a sinful indulgence, yet somehow managed to avoid becoming a grease fest. The bacon was chewy, full of flavor, and cooked to perfection. The cheddar in the cheese grits was blended in so that you got just the right amount of cheesy consistency in each bite. The biscuit and gravy was just OMFG: House-made biscuit with thick, but not overly dense and salty gravy. Little chunks of sausage sprinkled throughout so as not to overwhelm with porkiness in any one bite. The meal was like a breakfast orgy for my taste buds: every item brought something unique and wonderful to the table, and a good time was had by, well, me.  Guess what! They serve Counter Culture coffee! $3 and unlimited refills! So, by the time I was full, I simply levitated out of my seat and zipped out of there like one of those mini drones.  Service was friendly as could be and they always got whatever we asked for right away. One small criticism: as noted in other reviews, it felt like they really needed another server when the number of customers surpassed five. It was, at times, difficult to get our main server's attention... not necessarily her fault.   As for prices, with coffee ($3), food ($10), tax, and tip, I got out of there for just under $17. A very reasonable price and well worth every damn penny.  Oh! And there were maybe 10 people in there on Sunday at 11 AM. WTF are you doing, Charlotte?! Go to this place! Worship at the altar of incredible food and leave a more perfect person... well, at least a fatter and very satisfied person.",

    "text": "Maybe we ordered the wrong food, but this is no where near what we expected.  The ribs were tough and lacked flavor. The crab-stuffed trout was cooked fine, but lacked flavor. The paella it came with was over cooked and nothing worth noting for flavor. We sent the ribs back and they handled it correctly- I didn't want another serving, so they removed it from our bill and offered a free dessert. The only thing of note we ate were the Brussels sprouts, not that they were anything we haven't had elsewhere. The portion sizes are generous and our server was kind. A 3 star rating is also generous, but were hoping caught this place on an off- night.",

A high quality place in a not so high quality location. Prices are very reasonable for the quality you get. The chefs get a 10!  We had the bacon cheddar omelette wheat toast, blue berry pancakes were out of this worand the shrimp and grits.   I can back and had the burger and let me tell you this is the best burger I've had in my 9 years in charlotte.  The way this burger was crafted clearly demonstrated the love the chef(s) have for food.  It's honestly not just a burger but a culinary experience you won't forget.   Lima was very sweet and kind server.",

I could wax poetic about this waffle and it's deliciousness all day but realistically I'm gonna take a nap. Do yourself a favor and try it for yourself.",

Dinner is always top notch, but lately we've been going more for brunch for the simple reason that we cannot find a better one in Charlotte.  Seriously, with all of the new restaurants in Charlotte offering brunch, we try to check them out, but we keep coming back to the one that is closest to our house because it is still the best.  If you like more traditional breakfast items, the eggs Benedict with smoked bacon or the lobster omelette is excellent, while my wife usually orders chicken and waffles.  She claims they are the best she has had, which is high praise from someone who has ordered this dish at most places that serve it!  The coffee is perfect - smooth with no bitterness or unpleasant aftertaste.   But dining is only half of the experience.  Jerri goes out of her way to make every visit feel special when we are lucky enough to visit when she is there.  She even helped to make the yogurt and granola kid friendly for my 3 year old daughter.",

I wasn't disappointed,  but was not thrilled.  I suggest that they add the chicken dish from lunch to the dinner menu.  It was far superior to the dinner fried chicken.   Now that I've done dinner there, I will only be back for lunch.  Just the opinion of one.",

Consistent order mess ups or prepared improperly warrants a negative review but I can speak for my own experience. When checking options in Fort Mill, the choices are limited for a decent breakfast.

The sandwich I got was good, but the bread was not worth eating, and so I just pushed it off to the side.

I ordered the soy chorizo (sp?), potatoes, and eggs, and the dish is amazing!  The flavors meld beautifully, and there is more food than I can eat.  As a vegetarian, it can be difficult to find breakfast dishes that are interesting, different, and yummy.  This choice more than fit the bill.

You could tell it was on the burner for too long.  I sent it back and was offered a fresh cup but I declined.  I ordered the meatloaf mac and cheese.  Its a very small portion.  Be aware of that if you are a big eater.  The meatloaf was pretty good but nothing special abut the mac and cheese.  Not bad just not memorable.  Service is very friendly.

I like the \"smallness\" of FSC, but being able to accommodate more people is a good thing, too.   My friend had the mountain trout on a jambalaya type rice. I didn't taste it, but it looked great and he said it was. I however, had the warm asparagus salad. The egg comes over easy and I asked for over medium because I can't risk an undone white. Unfortunately, the egg arrived fried hard so I didn't get any runny yolk that would have been great. That did not keep the dish from being stupendous  (ha! who uses that word?). The grilled asparagus was delicious and the mushrooms had a good earthy taste. The kale side treatment was a tad woody, but again, the flavors were spot on. This is not a light dish, rather very rich so be prepared - I was delighted.  Why five stars this time?? Well well well, somebody did some coffee magic. It was dark and delicious.",

The veggies were cooked perfectly but the salmon was not seasoned at all and served upside down with the skin half off.  But was pretty good after I put salt and pepper on the salmon.  My friend had the scallops and roasted Brussels sprouts....she said the scallops were excellent but I think they should rename the side Brussels sprout chips since those things were overly fried.  We finished it off with the coconut cream pie.  The crust was too thick so it broke apart easily and the filling could have been anything since the pudding had no flavor.  But our waiter checked on us frequently so no complaints about the service - I just wish the food had been better.",

    "text": "\"Small, quaint cafe serving fresh quality food!\"  First let me ask... when was the last time you were in a small cafe with a fresh produce case in the dining area that had AT LEAST 6 pounds of fresh asparagus and probably 6 heirloom tomato varieties on display?   What kind of cafe uses up 6 pounds of fresh asparagus before it spoils? Answer: an outstanding little cafe with a gourmet menu!   The ambiance of Flipside comes up a bit short... it's location is tiny and has limited seating (probably under 30) so it cannot be called fancy. Flipside is very clean and maximizes the space available, and the staff is friendly and strives to make your dining experience amazing. The young couple that owns Flipside came to Ft. Mill following their dream of owning a small cafe serving excellent food!   They have succeeded in creating some FANCY FARE at wallet friendly prices! A tender prepared-to-your-order strip steak that is sure to please. There is also a roasted salmon that is fabulous! The two most expensive menu items are less than $20. The Flipside Melt is very good with some creative surprises. Open seven days a week Flipside offers breakfast (lobster omelet?), lunch, and dinner... and brunch (lobster quiche w/asparagus?) on Sunday 10AM-2PM!   There is a limited beer and wine offering that complements the menu with something for everyone. The Flipside Cafe has been here a while, but only recently did we hear of it! Right on the beaten path between Charlotte and Ft. Mill just north of the intersection of Regent Parkway... and passed by numerous times unnoticed until a friend recommended that we try it Note: Parking is BEHIND the two buildings in the complex fronting along US 21... access the parking lot between the buildings and enter the cafe from the parking lot side.",

My wife had an Alfredo dish that had red chilies and kale, neither of which I would have thought would be in a pasta Alfredo.  My steak was cooked as ordered and had a slight butter sauce on it with a unique taste.  We really enjoyed the tomato salad and especially the rhubarb cheesecake.",

The first occasion my big bugbear was that they seated us at a six top pub table with a baby in a high chair. My daughter just had a fab view of everyone's knees. Ordered Ravioli (great) Asparagus salad with a fried egg on top (I dream about it)  and the old man got a meatloaf (he wasn't a fan, but he thinks that  he just ordered the wrong thing).  Returned yesterday for lunch and I had the turkey chilli and the asparagus/egg/greens thingy again friend had the chilli and a warms greens salad. The chilli could have been a little hotter, but that asparagus salad is sooo good, I forgave that immediately. great little spot and a wonderful addition to our little town!",

There were quite a few things on the menu that I would like to try including several BLTs, some really nice salads and burgers. I chose the crabcake BLT and it was very tasty, served on a nice brioche roll with excellent seasoned french fries. One thing I notice about good restaurants is the attention to detail. The french fries were piping hot just out of the fryer instead of cool and limp like you get a lot of places. My colleague had the kale Caesar salad with grilled chicken and he commented that the chicken was very juicy and not dried out like is often the case. The service was attentive and I would definitely return. My one complaint was that the men's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair.   The floor hadn't had a good cleaning in quite some time and the walls were filthy and needed a good cleaning and a coat of paint. Also the toilet seat was loose and the soap dispenser was not secured properly to the wall. The dining room was clean but the condition of the restroom makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like.",

    "text": "My first trip to Flipside a few weeks ago did not leave me with a great impression because of a rude waitress. I subsequently received a message from owner Jon advising that they had made improvements in service and inviting me back for a second visit. I had already planned on giving the new restaurant another shot because the food looked excellent so I stopped by with a friend in town from Winston this past Sunday for brunch. There was no sign of the aforementioned waitress (my lucky day?) and both servers were very friendly and informative. I ordered the Benne Benne, which is a slightly modified version of eggs Benedict with regular bacon instead of Canadian bacon and is quite delicious. My friend had the lobster omelette, which he loved (I noticed several other diners licking their plates after finishing this dish as well). We also split the Carolina Grits, infused with amazing pimento cheese and topped with bacon jam.   Several of the prior reviews mentioned that cold coffee was served from thermoses. This situation has apparently been rectified as my coffee was refilled a few times directly from the carafe and was just as hot as you would want it.   Though I didn't get a chance to meet her, I did see owner/chef Amy personally deliver a few meals. She was somewhat of a celebrity to those who had clearly been to Flipside before.   I really, really enjoyed my second visit to Flipside Cafe. It is a quaint restaurant with great food in an area starved for dining options. This experience was good enough to make me forget about my first and I am excited to return with my wife for dinner in the near future.",

I had a hard time ordering anything else because it's so good! This time around we ordered Potato Bravas and I got the Chicken and Waffles.  chicken was cooked perfectly and Waffle was golden and warm, I ate the entire thing. I guess the only negative there would be it's not weight watcher friendly... it could be but it's hard to resist the goodness. Potato Bravas my husband enjoyed, the potatoes are next to amazing but for me personally I don't like rosemary so they weren't for me. With that being said they were cook perfect and seem to be a huge hit. Coffee is always good, they keep it coming without asking. And the main thing for me is they are always awesome to my kids!!! We will continue our weekend ritual for sure. Thank you Flipside!!",

She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and recommended her favorites. We opted for a starter of pimento cheese with pretzels and our main courses were the flip side burger and steak and potatoes. All three dishes were outstanding as was the service we received. We enjoyed lunch so much we returned the next day for breakfast. I highly recommend the breakfast due to their incredible appetizing options. This time our server was Jerri. Also incredible and very informative about the menu ( where every option sounded amazing ). We indulged yet again and got three options for breakfast so we could share are try different things.  My fiance got the flip side breakfast ( 2 eggs , biscuit and gravy , grits and bacon ) I opted for the shrimp and grits and we shared the Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffle with spiced banana and fruit. Everything was amazing and we just wish we lived closer to go more often. I end with this , can you go to chain restaurants ( Panera , Ihop, Waffle House ) sure. But you will spend $25-30 for 2 people. Why not spend that at a local place that will exceed all expectations. Also got the chance to meet the owner Amy. Good luck finding someone who works harder and seems to have as much passion as she does. Needless to say but we will be back as soon as possible.",

In point of fact, one of the big allures for leaving the Aloha State for the Carolina's was the opportunity partake in good old fashioned Southern cuisine whenever my heart desired.  I've passed by the Flipside Cafe on several occasions and always kept it on the back my mind when I was craving some pimento cheese grits.  Today was my first effort to have some of their fare, but I had to do it via phone order.  I ordered their pancakes and Carolina grits as well as some biscuits and gravy to go.  They said 10 mins, but it took more like 30 when all was said and done. I must say I was surprised when I walked in; It was like a cozy Cracker Barrel.  The entire establishment was exceptionally well laid out.    We were greeted at the door by an especially chipper waitress.  She was friendly and hurried back to the kitchen to collect our food.  Unfortunately we still had to wait for a bit while they got it together.  Fortunately because the place was so nice there was a lot to keep our eyes occupied.    As I mentioned, we took the food to go.  The pancakes were good, but nothing to write home about.  The maple syrup was just that. No special twists there.  The biscuits were garden variety and the gravy filled the spot.  I enjoyed the seasonal variety of fruits a lot.  I also loved their Carolina pimento cheese Grits. Very good.  All in all the grits and the fruit left an impression more so than the rest.  Great little place to satisfy your most basic southern desires. It is on my way home so I'm intrigued about their dinner menu. I'll likely try it out soon during the week and update about that as well.",

    "text": "I am forever grateful for my colleague's recommendation to try out Flipside Cafe. I went for brunch and ordered the Maine lobster omelette with potatoes instead of the seasonal fruit it comes with. Most restaurants skimp on the ingredients inside their omelettes, especially when it comes to seafood items, but Flipside did not. I got a mouthful of lobster, smoked bacon, and cheddar in every bite. It was absolutely delicious! My friend ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of blueberry pancakes. I snuck a couple bites of each and also enjoyed those entrees very much. For the price and portion sizes you just can't beat Flipside Cafe. Moreover, the service was prompt and friendly. After looking at the lunch and dinner menus online, I am positive I will be back for more visits.",

    "text": "Had a hankering for pancakes and SOS (biscuits and gravy) so onward to the Flipside. This place is cute quaint place that gives it a cozy home feeling.  We were immediately greeted.  We had already called in our order but after seeing this place,  definitely going to eat there next time. Although the female on the phone said it would be 10 minutes the food was not ready when we arrived 25 minutes later which I thought was odd.   The food looked delicious and I like that they had the gravy separated to keep the biscuits from being soggy by the time we got home. The Carolina grits were very tasty.  They are a must have. Loved the bacon jam.  Biscuits were good however the gravy was rather unremarkable. Pancakes were sweet and liked that the syrup was not cold.  Fresh fruit is always a nice touch. I gave a 3 as the food overall was not what I expected based on their high reviews. Only the grits made an impression,  everything else tasted like any other breakfast place.     Staff was friendly and genuinely happy to help and be there. We are planning to return to sample their dinner menu and I will update my review then.",

My order was a to-go order for blueberry buttermilk pancakes, crispy bacon, and the Carolina grits with pimento cheese-bacon jam. Honestly, I expected so much better, considering the reviews. The pancakes were so incredibly dense. Like, I couldn't get through one bite w/o water. They also just tasted bland, like flour with a splash of blueberry. The grits were lumpy as opposed to creamy, and I could have done w/o the jam. Lastly, the \"crispy\" bacon that wasn't crispy at all but super chewy instead. I really don't think I'll go back here again. If I do, maybe I'll try lunch or dinner. ",

We loved it, meat eaters and vegetarians alike.   There was a great salad with caramelized peaches, the Bibb salad, we raved about the meatloaf, the burgers, and the shepherds pie. The pretzels with the cheese suave as appetizers were to DIE for.  The whole place is super cute, the owner is friendly, and the food is amazing/fresh/local/delicious. Definitely check this place out!! If you're going to be with a group, call ahead. They can get a little crowded but if you have to wait, it's worth it.",

I was on the fence on ordering the tomato soup...Jerri said their soups were amazing...next thing I know she returns w/ a sample to tempt my tastebuds!! Well it worked!  A bowl was ordered!  She was absolutely spot on!  Ordered roasted Brussel Sprout appetizer...Nicely done. The Flipside Wedge & The Flipside Burger were lunch!!  SO much food ...every bite was delicious! Eyes were bigger than the stomach so Jerri graciously packed our remaining portions to go. I will be back to Flipside but this trip will be to experience their breakfast!!!  See ya soon Jerri!!  This is a must try",

I was really impressed that the syrup came out warm. There's nothing like cold syrup on a hot waffle.   Our food came out super fast. Everything was delicious!

My wife ordered the chicken and waffles, which they executed the southern classic very well.  The same is True about their shrimp and grits.

There are a couple of strange things about Flipside, but nothing that detracts from the experience. First, I went to download the menu on their website (to reference for writing this review), and it downloaded as a Word doc :). Second, the restaurant is in a strip mall, and if it weren't for a sandwich sign outside, it wouldn't be very inviting.  The brunch menu was perfect, and it should work for everyone from vegans to meat eaters that want bacon and eggs. I was feeling basic, so I went with the classic \"Flipside Breakfast,\" which has biscuits and gravy, eggs, smoked bacon, and cheddar grits. My friend went with the potato hash recommended by our server. We also ordered the Carolina grits (pimento cheese and bacon ham), which was the best thing we ate. I also couldn't skip a $5 bloody mary to kick off my Saturday.  Thank you Flipside for being a great option near Carowinds. Our brunch was significantly better than any park food or hotel food we could have gotten.",

For lunch we got the warm pimento cheese with the hot pretzels and let's just say it made pimento cheese a staple in our house now. My fiance had the steak with potatoes and I got the flip side burger with their famous Brussels sprouts.  the burger had bacon ham and pimento cheese on it. We even tried to recreate it at home.  For breakfast we went big. We got the shrimp and grits that won 7th place, the special with biscuit and gravy, eggs, grits, and bacon, followed by the Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffle. OMG does not describe the food. It was so amazing. The waffle is topped with the cereal and bananas foster, it's melt in your mouth good.   We will be back and can't wait to see the menu. The owner is kick ass, she came out to our table and we could say enough how awesome she is and how she hustles to make everything amazing. I highly recommend and we will see you next year!",

I'm a foodie, so off i go to Flipside Cafe, btw its only been open 1 week! So I originally wanted to have Breakfast/Brunch, but I was told that it was lunchtime. So I stayed and had lunch, WOW!!!! I didn't expect to be knocked off the proverbial ladder. I had the special, BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Pan Roasted Potatoes. It didn't appear to be much as the chicken and the ingredients seemed to have gotten lost inside that AWESOME BUTTERY/GARLIC BRIOCHE BUN. Wait for It-- Flavor City 101!! In the time I was there I witnessed a very new business owner, Amy, I didn't get a chance to meet Jon, run the front of the restaurant w/ tireless enthusiam. Out of the 7 people, including myself, these were the items ordered: 3 Chicken Sandwiches, 1 Hamburger, 1 Open Faced Turkey Plate, 1 Turkey Chili, and 1 Shrimp (Soy)Chorizo and Grits. Everyone was asked how they enjoyed the food, and the overall consensus was on par w/ my opinion. Thumbs Way Up, Awesome, The Best I've had, one person just shook their head and gave Two Thumbs Up. Bravo Flipside Cafe, you're on the way to a bigger location, sooner than expected! My name is D'Shawn and will definitely be going back to visit!",

Flipside came up in a quick Google search and had good reviews so we decided to try it out. Pulling up to a strip mall we weren't quite sure what we were going to be experiencing. Upon walking in we were pleasantly surprised with the decor and the aroma is coming out of the kitchen. The service and the food were exceptional. This is now our Saturday go to spot for brunch. Jerri is a great server and amazing bartender. We are originally from Colorado so we were excited at the opportunity to try some southern food. Their grits are amazing. We have had the flipside special, the biscuit bake, the parm potatoes and an omelette. Everything is phenomenal! Highly recommend this great spot. I noticed they have a dinner with drink pairings I think we're going to try to schedule for the next one.",

The ricotta gnocchi was such a creamy goodness and the mix of vegetables with it were delightful.  We had shrimp and grits with soy chorizo- I believe the spinach was a good add for the grits and the chorizo.  The bagette was served with two different butters- strawberry rhubarb and praline. Both very good. The braised pork belly was dry and I found cutting the meat like an armwrestling tournament. The server was very sweet and she tended to us in quick time.   My company made up for the braised pork, but they did tell me the sister restaurant had a better version of it. It could have been just a bad night for the chef at our restaurant.",

    "text": "Food was fabulous.  We got the steak & eggs with a side of the pimento cheese grits.  We should have stopped there because that was enough to feed 3 people!  But we also got the crunchy cinnamon waffle which was unique, and very tasty.  Those grits though... I will always remember those!  It was my first time having grits.  I am told that they are rarely cooked and flavored well, but these were excellent!  The potatoes that came with the steak and eggs were perfectly soft in the middle but crispy on the outside as well.  The reason I took off 1 star.  And please, I don't mean to be offensive towards the owner, but you NEED to do something about your bathrooms.  I don't know what the men's room looked like, but the women's room was absolutely disgusting.  I thought I walked into a nasty dive bar's bathroom.  There are splatters and stains all over the wall.  The door around the knob and towards the bottom are like, stained black from fingers touching it over the years.  I just don't know how management could use that bathroom every day and not think to themselves, damn, we need to buy a $20 can of paint, or some damn cleaner at least and clean these walls!",

    "text": "Flipside Cafe is an adorable cafe decorated with southern style and charm, with the friendliest and attentive service to match.  It's worth a super short drive from Charlotte for a great breakfast!  If you're a breakfast potato fan, the Potato Bravas are pretty incredible. They are perfectly and consistently crispy browned and seasoned.  I wish I could make that happen so well when I do it!  The rosemary creme fraiche takes it over the top with flavor, so good luck trying to stop yourself from devouring them. If you're not a rosemary and lemon fan, know that the rosemary lemon flavor is prominent. You may not care for them as much as I did if you're not a fan of that flavor profile.  I loved them.   The sausage gravy had nice seasoning that took it up a notch from what I've found to usually be a little more bland tasting sausage gravy elsewhere.  Biscuits were on point.  So good!  I absolutely recommend Flipside Cafe and look forward to getting back and trying more of their menu.  This could be my favorite breakfast spot in the Charlotte area.",

    "text": "We arrived during the dead zone between lunch and dinner (3pm).  The place was clean and organized, so they recovered well from the lunch rush.  Alice was our server, and she was attentive and ready to discuss the beer selection and the rest of the menu.  She was passionate about the food and the restaurant - to the point I thought she might be the owner, not knowing any better.  My wife chose the \"6 buck Chuck\"  burger lunch special with fries, along with a side of flash-fried Brussels sprouts with bacon, drizzled in balsamic vinegar.  All the components of the burger, including the house-made pimento cheese, blended well to make an excellent burger.  The fries stayed crispy throughout the meal.  My choice was the meatloaf (grass-fed beef), wrapped in bacon, with crispy onions on the top and served over mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and flavorful, and the meatloaf was simply terrific.  The restaurant side is soon to be renovated, to update, and more match the bar side.  It shows some sign of wear, but the tables were in excellent condition, and did not take away one bit from the quality of the meal - and that's what you're there for, anyway.  My only regret is that I'm not from the area, so I might not get there again.  If you are in the area, this is a must-visit.",

At the table we ordered a mimosa (yes on a Thursday afternoon don't judge me), coffee, potatoes bravas, veggie omelet, blt, and the fort mill breakfast bake. Nothing disappointed! So these potatoes omg, I'm a sucker for breakfast potatoes but these were amazing! Super crispy, well seasoned, topped with the creme fraiche, some lemony goodness, and herbs, serious perfection! The biscuit bake, so good, cast iron crust but a light fluffy biscuit, and the smoked bacon on top with cheese and gravy, oh my goodness.

The breakfast itself was good, nothing over the top, but good. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the sausage gravy was delicious. The biscuit itself was a little dry, even with the gravy. I went for the upcharge and got their roasted potatoes, and honestly, I didn't think they were worth it. Some were burnt and some were pretty raw. The bacon was perfectly cooked...crispy and melt-y all at the same time. The coffee falls in the \"good coffee\" category - robust, flavorful and smooth - I'd take a cup of that any day!

    "text": "Flipside is close to me and I've been to the other location, the Flipside restaurant in Rock Hill for business dinners and thought we'd try it on a Thursday night.   The location is a bit strange, as it's kind of in a run down shopping plaza.  When we walked in and there were basically 2 sides to the restaurant and we were seated at the table right by the bathrooms.  I should have said something, but whatever. What I liked about Flipside is that they can accommodate my daughters celiac and the staff is educated enough to let us know what is safe to eat and what isn't.  She had the Shrimp & Grits which was excellent. I ordered the ribs at the waitresses recommendation.  They were great.  Healthy portion, good sauce and pretty damn meaty.  Side of well prepared collard greens and cole slaw.  Food was great and at a nice price point.  We'll be back.",

They're talented, quick, offer suggestions and even if they're tired, they're smiling through it.  Now, as good as the staff is, the food is even better. While the grits always need a side of salt (which I get because you don't want to oversalt for those with medical situations and such), that's a small thing that's barely worth mentioning (unless you like salt in your grits, so I did. lol).  On the most recent visit, I got the Flipside Breakfast with a biscuit with gravy, bacon, grits and two eggs anyway. I got the eggs scrambled and when I tell you they were piping hot, I am not exaggerating. I was so excited. I got the bacon crispy and it had just the right snap. The biscuit was so light and fluffy and it was a perfect vehicle for getting gravy into my face.   The husband got the Maine Lobster omelet and I specifically asked for a piece, but did not get one before his plate was completely cleared. So, I have concluded that it was delicious.  Special note: Mimosas for $4 and Bloody Mary's for $5 at brunch.  If there's only two in your party, try the bar if you go for brunch. They're pretty crowded on the weekend mornings!",

The ambience was comfortable, the staff friendly and accomodating and the food most wonderful in all ways: attractive plating, good portions, reasonable prices but most of all downright delicious. We shared appetizers of avocado stuffed bread, crab cakes, fried brussel sprouts,  white cheddar pimento cheese, plus autumn squash soup, tomato soup , entrees of chicken salad sandwich, beef on weck and the Flipside burger with a side of grilled asparagus. Everything just delicious, well seasoned nothing overly salty or spicy. We would certainly return and try different menu choices. This restaurant is a cut above so to speak in my opinion from other restaurants in the area.",

We were quickly given a table. Our waiter was very friendly but the service could have been better - we had to ask a few times for things we needed - straws, silverware, more drinks etc.  The food was great!.  For apps we had the pimento cheese with the pretzels - it comes with 2 pretzels but you can request they add on however many you want for an additional fee. I had the Fried green tomato BLT with the truffle fries.  I really love their pimento cheese, so good! I would like to go back for brunch sometime. For sure a must try if in the area!",

Pleasantly surprised by the high quality coffee, and definitely impressed with the sky-high fluffy biscuit. The servers and kitchen were extremely accomodating, especially with series of veggie substitutions for one of our party who was on a low-carb diet.  No easy feat in the South! Will likely return for dinner where the menu looks innovative, affordable and tasty.  Note: location isn't really visible from the road, but tucked away in a small strip mall.  Also, this is a small joint, its not easy to anyone a large party, although the staff will do their best. Stick to groups smaller than 6.",

Our server was attentive and they were \"coming right up\" and came out piping hot....suspiciously like they had just been cooked.   They were awesome. Not too sweet. Not too salty. Perfect amount of bacon mixed in. They just didn't come on time.   We will be back for sure. And hopefully can switch into 5 star mode.",

    "text": "Checked this place out the other weekend with what was originally going to be a large group.  I had called and made reservations for 10 on Wednesday (for Saturday) and our group ended up dwindling down to 6.  No worries though, they were expecting us and it actually worked out because they were waiting on one other family to push tables together to accommodate our party, but since we had already \"shrank\" we were able to sit right away (and early).  They were super busy (as expected on a Saturday morning) but our server was welcoming and got us started on drinks.  Everything on the menu looked/sounded delicious.  We also had a vegetarian in our group, so breakfast is never really the easiest meal for her, but they had the soy chorizo as an option and she was quite happy after the meal.  I had the chicken and waffles and was pretty impressed.  I usually go for something with eggs, but we ended up having an extra order of eggs that we split so win-win for me.    As the food was coming out, there was a bit of syrup spilled on the floor due to the server carrying too many plates.  Non-issue, but the staff came over and cleaned i up right away (it was under my chair).  They were super apologetic, but I totally get it - accidents do happen.  I am just glad the syrup didn't fall on my head or down my shirt :).  Overall the Flipside cafe was a great dining experience.  There was a big wait at the door as we were leaving so that is usually a good sign of a good business (worth waiting for).  The turn-around for breakfast is fasted paced and this place does it well.",

My wife and I go to brunch every Sunday after church so we are always looking for a new place. I was really excited when I found this spot because it's so close to home and there are not many great brunch options in the Steele Creek area.  The menu is small but right away I saw at least five or six things that I wanted to try my first time here (Potatoes Brava - specialty potatoes topped with paprika and parmesan cheese, pimento cheese grits topped with bacon Jam, a seafood omelette, a biscuit bake topped with egg and bacon and the list goes on). Also, what's brunch without drinks (specifically mimosas and bloody marys). They have $3 mimosas (which are very strong especially for the price) and $5 bloody marys.  For food I went with the flip side breakfast because I really just wanted somesthing simple today; grits, eggs and bacon. The biscuit and gravy was just icing on the cake. My wife went with the chicken and waffles. The waffle was absolutely amazing. The chicken was great too. I prefer chicken wings however they pair their waffles with chicken tenders but they were still really good. I'm super excited to come back and try something else!  Pros: - Amazing food options - Strong cheap mimosas - Great service and friendly staff - Full bar  Cons: - No specialty coffee options",

The grits were cheese grits ( which was not explained on the menu) and I may be in the minority, but I prefer plain and do not like cheeses.  The biscuits tasted canned and were not good.  Then I got the bill and they charge $3.00 for coffee. My bill with tip was $20.  For what we got I will not go back for breakfast.",

Chef Amy checked on us on both visits and we liked the food very much but they really need to step up the service.  We've tried the chicken & pasta, meatloaf, mushroom empanadas, tomato soup, turkey chili, potatoes bravas and open faced turkey.  The food is very good, they have a limited menu but they do things well, portions are just right.  The service the 1st visit was spotty, I understand they were newly opened and still working out the details but last weekend the server was not at all friendly and the only server.  I can appreciate that fact that she could have been stressed since the place was pretty full but that's no reason to take it out on the customers.  She didn't refill drinks and kept trying to take our plates & glasses when we were not finished.  I'll probably be back if we are in the area and they receive their alcohol license.",

We were the only people in the restaurant on a weekday morning, and unfortunately our food was completely inedible.  My undercooked waffle had a slightly rancid taste to it, and my mother's sausage gravy was dried up and chalky.  Even my coffee was old and gross.  I was embarrassed that I brought my mom somewhere so awful, paid the bill, and left.  We grabbed food elsewhere after wasting 25 dollars on a breakfast we couldn't eat.",

After being seated it became apparent that there were more patrons than the initial 2 waitresses could effectively accomodate. A 3rd waitress joined the staff at around 9:21. I ordered the Maine Lobster Omlet and my wife ordered The Flipside Breakfast. We had both previously had the FSB and enjoyed it. However today my wife's grits were cold and the coffee was luke warm. The waitress brought my wife another bowl of grits.....still cold.  NOT GOOD.  The disappointing part of this exchange is that the waitress didn't offer to reduce the cost of the meal or offer a raincheck. Chances are that we ll go back at some point,  just not soon.  When it's not right for the customer it should be the goal of the establishment to make it right. I'm just saying....",

The servers were really friendly and helpful in answering questions about the menu.  I had the smoked salmon sandwich and a side of pimento cheese grits. The grits were absolutely fantastic! The pimento cheese had a little heat in it that made the grits spot on. The salmon sandwich was quite large with plenty of smoked salmon on it. It came with deviled egg mayo on the bagel--/ the mayo was phenomenal. The arugula and pickled onion gave it a nice bite! If I would have realized the portion sizes were so large I would have forgone the grits because I only finished half.",

I ordered the Chicken and Waffles - and a side of potatoes (I LOVE hash-browns/breakfast potatoes!!!) the others in my party ordered the steak and eggs, and some sort of lobster omelet.... (The menu states the pieces of lobster aren't small, but that remains to be seen)  Anyway.... The steak and eggs I think were ok.... very small piece of steak. but he seemed to be ok with it, but he doesn't complain much anyway... The chicken and waffles; Yeah I was really disappointed.  the chicken was sort of flavorless... not dry but not moist either.  and do NOT expect a whole waffle, you GET HALF!!!! that is all.  the menu doesn't state this but when we ask the waitress she brought our other 1/2 just because... the potatoes... I did not like at all... not cooked throughout.  They were hard in the center and WAY too much rosemary something on them.  (I wish we had gone somewhere else to be honest. ) The lobster Omelet; looked a little overcooked on the outside (the egg was brown from cooking too long) and from what I was told the lobster in it was small and hard to find.  I have to say we will not be making a special trip here for breakfast which is a shame because we were excited about it.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for a late breakfast (they open at 10) on Sunday to check this place out. There are not that many breakfast places near me so we were excited.  Although they open at 10, there were already 2-3 tables seated so that was good. Did not need to wait! I would say there are about 12-15 tables in there and the cafe is on the smaller side.   I might give the place another chance once they get the swing of things going but I was not too impressed. I wanted to be! Again, think service and food will get better but its not there yet. The service was not super friendly, which I dont need, but a smile would be welcoming. The coffee comes out of a thermos that you pump out the top which is fine if it keeps it hot, but it wasnt too hot. Maybe thicker mugs would keep it that way.  We ordered the house made ricotta with fruit and walnuts which was different, but I was surprised that the ricotta had lemon and herbs in it. They forgot the honey, which I think it was supposed to come with, so I asked for that and added it and it tasted better. My husband got the cinnamon waffler (slightly underdone so just not crisp enough) and I got the eggs benedict. There are two eggs, which it did not say on the menu so that is good! However, they were overcooked so not runny. The hollandaise was delicious, however. I do applaud the fact that they support and use some local products. I am glad that the cafe is in this location though because it seems like lots of familes are taking advantage of it.",

Yes it's in an itty bitty strip mall, but don't judge this book buy it's parking lot because inside awaits one of the best farm to table blackboard restaurants in the Charlotte area. Every beer, cheese, veggie, and piggy has been pain stakingly noted up on their board for you to enjoy. A simple and delicious farm to table, fresh and perfect meal from beginning to end. It's a small location intimate location, so if you are a big party, more than 6 call ahead. If you are looking for something bigger go to their other location off Main street in Rock Hill. Same amazing Farm to Table food with a much larger menu and a large dinning area that can handle big parties.",

It was our first time here and I (being a Foodie) had not really heard anything about this place. Small but smartly decorated like a Country Cafe, this was truly a pleasant surprise. We started out with the Brussel Sprouts, oven roasted and so crispy with Balsamic and sea salt!  We also had Amy's Pimento cheese with warm Pretzels....better than the fair! Just delicious! Then I had the In Season Tomato soup with Brioche Croutons, very good. The best was the Warm Asparagus Salad with a Fried Egg, Marinated Mushrooms, Kale and  fresh Parm. It was heavenly! My husband had the The Flipside Melt which was their Burger with Homemade Pimento Cheese, Bacon Jam on a Brioche with Parmesan. Really a great burger.  We ended it with their Flourless Chocolate Cake with Orange Peel Ice Cream and Brittle. Prices were reasonable and the whole Farm to Table with the Name of all the local farms and dairys' they use were clearly available for all to see. I hear they have another Restaurant in Rock Hill called The Flipside Restaurant. I will be going to try it out also...Really a Hidden Gem....",

Flipside Cafe is rather small, seating is available outside but in 90 degree weather, waiting a single minute would make wait to leave. We were seated after a 45 min wait. Smaller groups were sat before us and that pissed me off! The hostess was apologetic and made up for the long wait. I ordered the shrimp and grits. Was just okay BUT she brought my mimosa in a larger glass. My son ordered the pancake. Suggested if he didnt like them she would allow him to order something else free of charge. Another relative ordered the Lobster omlette. She wasnt pleased with taste as the seafood overpowered the other ingredients. Before bringing out the check she brought her the shrimp and grits!! I thought that was a really nice gesture.. I will recommend ordering the small plate grits. Full of flavor!",

We went for dinner and Our service was horrible. Dinner on a Wednesday took 2 hours.  Our waitress spent the night socializing with other staff, cruising her phone and eating.(There were 4 other tables in the entire restaurant) I had to get up and ask the hostess for ketchup (we ordered a burger). We finished our drinks and appetizer before she finally took our dinner order. We asked for boxes which she forgot and then boxed up one of our meals and left ALL of the other dinner plates on the table. There were 4 in our party, 2 adults 2 children and she plopped our dessert brownie on the table with 2 spoons and left ALL our dinner plates sitting there. I was so grossed out smelling crab cakes and beef and chocolate that we stood up and cleared our own plates to the bar area. I will NEVER go back to the Fort Mill location. It is run by teens and 20 year olds and there was no manager present. I complained at the end of the night and all they said was \"I'm sorry. I hope you come back\".",

The staff is friendly, everyone enjoyed their food, and our server was awesome! (Can't remember her name at the moment.) I convinced our group to come here using all the amazing Yelp pics but was disappointed to find out most of the items I'd been excited about were only served on weekends for brunch. I ended up having the amazing shrimp and grits and an order of truffle fries on the side - wow, those are Realy Flavorful truffle fries and there are a Lot of them! I couldn't finish the fries and I had worked hard all morning - that's impressive. I would Love to come back for a date for dinner any night or brunch for sure!",

It's just so claustrophobia inducing inside. The interior design seems very haphazard. Yes, I realize it is a small space and there is only so much you can do, but still...  I just don't feel relaxed in a restaurant when I'm practically knocking elbows with the next table. Not to mention that you can see much of the storage of food, dishes, etc from the dining area. The large prep area feels very cluttered and unorganized.  A food delivery truck arrived while we were there and so that provided entertainment, because you can see everything.  I don't know, if you are looking for a relaxing meal with a little privacy on the side, Flipside isn't for you. I have heard that the Rock Hill location is much larger and more comfortable so I think I will go there, as I did really enjoy the food.",

    "text": "Sister and I planned on lunch, FYI, brunch is usually done by 1:00 but on this Saturday they were packed and switching over to lunch was delayed for a short 15 minutes. Well worth the wait for the delicious Chuck burger, $7.00 for weekend lunch, (a deal) and even better bargain, Monday thru Friday for $5.00. When I say this was the best burger I have eaten I mean it. A juicy burger grilled perfectly medium rare (imagine that) getting it my way. The burger consisted of a brioche bun, their bacon jam, lettuce and topped with pimento cheese. The bacon jam and pimento cheese was a perfect compliment to the Chuck Burger. Home fried potatoes were cubes of crisp outsides and tender interiors.  Gosh, it was all so yummy, I finished the entire meal. I hear the Brussel sprout side dish is awesome too. I believe this tiny cafe is one secret gem. Glad sister and her daughter found this delicious place. Will return again soon, I'm craving that burger already. Keep up the good work Flipside. P. S. Great service and efficiency during a packed house Saturday.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of discovering this excellent little cafe while visiting friends in Charlotte NC last weekend. After doing a quick Yelp search this was the first stop listed and was a short hop over the border into SC from their place in Steele Creek.   Once we arrived the place was smaller than expected and quite full, however they had a tablet for the four of us immediately. We're lucky we got there when we did because by the time we left there was a line outside waiting to get in. I wouldn't have wanted to wait in that heat.   As I said the place was small, but you aren't packed in like sardines. The server took our drink orders as soon as we were seated and delivered menus and utensils with the drinks a couple of moments later.   After looking over the excellent menu my friend Dave ordered the Maine Lobster Omelet. His wife and I decided to have the same entree, the Steak-N-Egg breakfast. Dave's brother Charles who was also visiting from out west went with the daily special, Cinnamon Crunch Waffles.   After an appropriate wait our dishes arrived. Jessie and I both agreed that our Steak-N-Egg meals were delicious. On mine the  steak was cooked exactly as asked (Medium) and there was a decent portion of home fries topped with eggs. As I finished the meal I noticed there was no toast. Make sure you order that if you want it was it doesn't come with the dish. Dave's Lobster Omelet also looked awesome, he enjoyed it but said it wasn't as \"out of this world\" as he had hoped. Charles also said he really enjoyed his Cinnamon Crunch Waffles.   All in all, an excellent breakfast. Next time I'm in the area maybe I'll get a chance to check them out for dinner.",

Tea-I'm really surprised a place like this doesn't have sweet tea!! They give you unsweet tea with a little sweet syrup on the side. It is not good. The syrup didn't make my tea sweet at all and it's really messy to do the whole process for a glass of sweet tea. Atmosphere-It's ok. It's small. We got sat at the high tops. The stools have no back so it was really uncomfortable to eat and since the restaurant is small, I kept getting hit and bumped.   I would definitely try this location again but I'm gonna have to ask for low top seating and I will get juice next time. :)",

You may be waiting a while for a table if you come during peak times. But don't let that discourage you. This place is worth it!   This place is a farm to fork cafe They list the local farms they deal with on the chalkboard above the counter.  The menu consists of elevated American cuisine.  They have burgers, their take on mac n cheese, fish, salads, shrimp n grits, and so much more.  For lunch I went with the meatloaf mac n cheese which was recommended by our server.  My coworkers both went with the 5 buck chuck burger which was also recommended.  The mac n cheese was amazing and came with a slice of meatloaf on top. Cut a piece off and mix it with the mac n cheese and you're in heaven! My coworkers said the burger was one of the best they've ever tasted.  The staff was great here and very friendly and helpful. I also love decor and all the pictures of trees and tree sculptures.   I'm already thinking of what to try on my next visit.",

    "text": "Several months ago we came back and the servers and hostess were very confused; our orders were wrong and we complained. The manager came out and gave us cards and profusely apologized; so I hoped it was a one-off and didn't change my review.  Today we came in for brunch, and the front end of the house is either WOEFULLY undertrained or understaffed. They seem super overwhelmed and severely lacking in communication. Our server was terribly frazzled and forgetful. We had to flag her down to wait on us. Then she forgot our drinks. Then she forgot our app (potatoes Bravos); after I reminded her, she went back and got it. We then had to remind her we needed utensils. She forgot the avocado mayo we asked for until she saw me sitting looking at her as she meandered around confused in the DR, THEN forgot the pancakes my bf ordered with his breakfast. Very irritating when you are waiting on something for your meal. After we asked, she brought the pancakes after we'd finished. She blamed it on the kitchen (not). She only offered to refill our drinks finally after we were finished. We had to go ask her for our check - and even after that it took her forever. Very very confused and forgetful; makes for a poor dining experience. The hostess is doing ENTIRELY too much and should not be busing and serving during busy hours but attending the hostess stand; she is frazzled and it is irritating to customers because she can't do everything well at the same time. I get the feeling the front end of the house doesn't have a separate manager and servers are getting trained by other poorly trained servers and no restaurant 101 at all; someone here needs to find out how that works! Will go back; hopefully will see an improvement and will update. The food is still good.",

Here's why I'm giving it a 4 star, if I can give them 4.5 than I would.  My Beef on Weck was absolutely without a doubt the best I've had and the White Bean Hummuz....oh my goodness, it was so tasty...by the time I thought about taking a picture of it, it was all gone, I mean clean plate gone. Both my husband and my son got Steak and Potatoes and it seemed over cooked for medium rare...it was more on the medium well side but they both said the sauce was delicious. My son also got the Loaded Fried Potatoes and devoured it. Our waitress, Meg, she was so sweet and such a delight. She had such a beautiful smile, she was funny and just awesome. One of the best service we had. If we didn't live 3 hours away, I would make that a regular spot for me to dine in at.",

While sitting there I could see most people only had to wait a few minutes before getting a table. I guess due to location the traffic in and out was steady  Service.  Not bad but not great.  I feel the cafe needed one more server. I could tell the two that they had were in little overwhelmed.  This caused a delay in our table being cleaned off and for my coffee to be forgotten about. But the servers were pretty nice and did apologize  Food. Really, really good. I had the Flipside Breakfast which was cheddar grits, 2 eggs, bacon, and biscuits with gravy.  The eggs and bacon were ok; I felt the eggs were scrambled a little too hard and the bacon was too rubbery.  The grits and biscuit made up for it. The grits were so smooth. The gravy on the biscuits were AMAZING.  Best gravy I've had in a while. They have the biscuit and gravy as a side so try it if you get something else   I also had a pancake on the side (yeah I'm a fat kid). That was also really good. I wish I had two.  My girlfriend had the lobster omelette and she enjoyed it. I had a taste and thought it wasn't bad. It was a little overcooked honestly. I liked my breakfast more.   It seems the cafe turns into a little bar too at some point. They had a surprising amount of beers listed.  I really hope they open a place somewhere in Charlotte. I think they could do pretty well if it's a good location.",

Not sure if there is a different team at lunch but bringing colleagues here, the lunches have been pretty amateur hour. I talked this place up so much to my friends, and they both thought it was pretty mediocre. I ordered the chopped salad which was just thrown on a plate, see picture. They gave me brown avocado two times in a row. When I complained the first time the waitress just seemed annoyed and told me it was just oxygen and there's nothing wrong with it. My friend ordered the meatloaf mac & cheese and didn't even touch half of his meal saying it was pretty bland with no flavor.  We also got the pimento cheese dip, the dip was great but the pretzels were completely over cooked some what rock hard.

    "text": "I went for dinner on a friday night, just my husband and I.. We were in the area and had heard about Flipside being a fresh, new restaurant that served food from local farms and thought we would try it. We walked in to a tiny little cafe, with randomly sized tables scattered everywhere.. Some full of people, some dirty, and some empty. There wasn't a hostess stand.. just a stack of menus on the nearest counter and someone from across the cafe greeted us and told us we could seat our selves.    There were a lot of different size tables and all very close together.. We chose a 2 top near the cafe counter and looked at the menu that only had food listed on it. No drinks anywhere. Nor was any of the meals described in much detail.. Just... Meat + Sides + Price. The Waitress came by took our drink and food orders.. She returned with drinks, but no silverware... I snagged my own set from an abandoned table next to me ( it was so close, I didn't even need to stand up ) The food took a pretty long time to come out.. and in the meantime we watched as random people trickle in and seated themselves, and  our lone waitress serving them all while other people working in the cafe bringing plates of food out awkwardly, and having to maneuver themselves thru the tables and serve people.. It was weird and seemed really unprofessional.  Finally my food came.. It was good, nothing to complain about! I had BBQ Half Chicken, with Spinach and Mac N Cheese.. Once I was done, we inquired more about the ingredients and technique to prepare the food and the waitress had no idea what to tell us.. She repeated what was listed on the menu and then came back later to offer us slightly more info about the BBQ sauce having honey in it..?  It was laughable, but no harm done.. My final opinion of the Flipside cafe would have to be that its just TRYING too hard to be something It can't. Maybe Breakfast or lunch is better? But trying to eat Dinner in such a cramped space, with \"gourmet\" prices and untrained/casual service is backwards and confusing.",

We loved our dinner and felt like there was a lot of thought put into the menu selection.   The service was great-our server was very attentive and polite.

Amy Fortes' (Chef and Owner, along with Jon Fortes) last gig, I'm told, was Upstream, so we are so happy for that calibre of chef to be in our little neck of the woods. She is amazing and so hospitable! Each visit she has been on the floor making sure all her customers are doing well. The service has always been efficient, but warmly friendly for us.  Amy specializes in local fare, and the current vendors are listed on the board over the coffee bar. The following farmers were listed when we visited: Tega Hills Farm, Barbee Farms in Concord, as well as Counter Culture Coffee in Durham, NC among several others. The menu is limited but covers a range of tastes and is highly creative. Servings are not large, but I found they were more than adequate, and my taste buds were totally satisfied. I went twice for dinner. I had the Flipside Melt, their signature hamburger: wonderful Brioche bun; fabulous Pimento Cheese with T.O.P. jam and perfectly crispy Potato Wedges. My BF had Amy's Shepard Pie, made with Braised Shortribs, which she loved. We also split the Flipside Bibb, a salad made with Peppadews (slightly sweet & spicy), Blue Cheese, Buffalo Bacon and a tasty Vinaigrette. Next time I had the Roasted Salmon with Asparagus Noodles, Grits (not a big fan but loved these because they were flavored with) Bacon Jam and Smoked Tomato Cream. Salmon was perfectly cooked and I loved the combination of sauce flavors, which seems to be something Amy excels at. My husband had the Iron Skillet Roasted NY Strip served with Potato Puree, Wilted Kale and Charred Onion Butter. Once again, cooked perfectly and so flavorful. When I went for Brunch, I and my BFF had the Lobster Quiche with Bacon, Asparagus, Smoked Cheddar and Fruit. The filling was very flavorful, although the crust itself was dry. (Someone else I know had a muffin and was unimpressed so baking may not be their forte.) My husband had a Benne! Benne! their version of Eggs Benedict which was melt in your mouth wonderful! Here's hoping they get enough business at this location to stay longer than Eat Well, who was also pretty good. They are really already cramped, especially on Sundays (not a good time to go!).",

Mostly 2 tops but some tables for larger parties if necessary.  We showed up for a good breakfast and they did not disappoint.  I ordered the breakfast plate with Eggs, Bacon, Grits, and Biscuit with Gravy.  The waitress said her favorite was the Benne Benne (Eggs Benedict) so I asked her to include a ram of Hollandaise for me to try on my eggs.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The grits were light and fluffy. The biscuit fluffy with ample gravy to soak up.  The eggs with the hollandaise were spot on.  My friend had the Steak and Eggs breakfast and it looked amazing!  The steak cooked perfectly and the potatoes seasoned just right.  All in all, I would most definitely recommend this little spot and I will be back for sure.",

They make a mean cup of coffee & have some decent beers (in bottles) too!  One of the owners, Amy, is always out & about - serving food along with their friendly, proficient (but small) staff.   Cool & clean place.",
