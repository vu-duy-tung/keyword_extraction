Everything I've had is great. I'll have to start ordering delivery. I've been a customer for almost 4 years now and would occasionally visit their old location.",

This place is not on my usual restaurant row, but it will be worth the drive to go back!  I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and Plantains as a side.  It was all excellent!  The best caribbean cooking I have experienced in CLT.  Not sure what kind of sauce was on the chicken or seasoning in the rice, but......Yum!  The plantains were cooked perfectly, nicely browned but tender inside.  My friend had the wings with Hennessy sauce and Mac and loved both.  It is reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive.",

Everything was delicious, except the Cole slaw I was disappointed in the Cole slaw it was too heavy needed more cabbage and less cream. The taste and texture wasn't to my liking. Everything else was perfection. The rice and pea was amazingly delicious. I like the way the wings were cooked. Both flavors were satisfying and I also ordered two slices of their cake. One lemon and one chocolate both were  satisfying.  If not for the Cole slaw I would give 5stars. I still plan on trying them again, I enjoyed everything else in my order.",

I had lemon pepper wings - fried rice combo and plantains for dessert and a ginger beer. Lunch of this caliber deserves a beer of some sort and ginger was all they had. The jerk chicken was absolutely perfect with a nice spicy kick. I had the popular henny BBQ wings and they came in 3rd after lemon pepper and jerk flavors. Fried fish and okra was a hit and greens were good as well . You may not be easy to see from the road but you must find this place and have the wings!",

Their sides don't hold up well against the flavorful wings, could use a bit more flavoring and freshness. They taste like they've been sitting for a while. Overall, give the henny wings a try. You won't be dissappointed with their flavor!",

Man oh man those reviews were right, those Hennessey wings were out of this world outstanding, smoked and grilled in a unique sweet flavor sauce.  The plantains were cooked to perfection and the jerk chicken was good.  I ordered the turkey wings because I had never seen that on a menu and wanted to give it a try.

I'll definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Ok this is coming from a guy that never is moved to the point to actually stop a write a review. This time it's serious!  If it's one cuisine I'm intimately familiar with, it's Caribbean.   I'm originally born & raised in The D, but have spent so much time in Jamaica that I refer to it as my 2nd home. I've vacationed there numerous times. I've gone \"outside\" the resort and into the heart of Kingston too many times to mention. I've eaten from all the hot spots in and around the capital city, including road side joints that have those FIRE JERK dishes!  My wife (also from The D) and I we're married in Jamaica 20 years ago and just recently returned from celebrating our 20th year wedding anniversary.   Jerk snapper, Curry goat, Ox tails, Rice & Peas, Callaloo, Plantains, Ting Pineapple Soda, Red Stripe, Ackee n' Saltfish, Scotch Bonnet Peppers, Coco Bread, All Spice, WalkerWood Spices, Jamaican Rum, Escoviech Fish, Conch, Stew Peas, etc.     I know Jamaican cuisine.   ALL OF IT.   Ty's is by far the best authentic Caribbean restaurant in the Chatlotte metro area. That says a lot due to there being more than a few of these eateries in and around the Queen City.  What separates Ty's from the rest is basically two key components that (to me) are key to effectively nailing Jamaican cuisine.   1. FRESHNESS  2. MASTERING OF THE JERK SAUCE  I've tried other spots and I can tell immediately when they try to pass off yesterday's left overs for today's main entree. I can also tell when things have been frozen, unthawed, then reheated for (yet again) today's main entree. My superior palate can tell each and every time a Jamaican corner is cut, with regard to not wanting to waste old food and pass it off as something it's SO not.   Ty's doesn't go into this area at all. Everything they prepare is made to order and I don't know about you, but I don't mind the wait knowing my meal is being prepared fresh and to my exact specifications. Ty's doesn't cut corners and they treat their customers like Jamaican Royalty!  Lastly, Ty's has mastered the fine art of the Jerk sauce as well as the Jerk process. Laypeople tend to unknowingly think the only critical component to the Jerk sauce is to make sure it has plenty of spicy kick. If that were True then the same thing can be accomplished by simply dumping a ton of your favorite hot sauce on whatever it is you ordered.   Jerk is just the opposite of that. Jerk sauce is the harmonious blend of dry spices, wet spices, spicy spices, and an array of actual peppers that range from manageable-mild all the way to an intense inferno!  That marriage of Jerk ingredients must be orchestrated by a Caribbean professional who is authentically trained to perform these spice nuptials. Ty's has a gentleman in its kitchen who eagerly performs those nuptials on a daily basis, without missing a single beat.   Everything on the menu is a can't miss. The chicken, fish, shrimp, oxtails, beef patties- you name it and they hit it out the park every single time! Don't forget to seal the deal with a Jamaican pineapple soda and a slice of decadent spice cake for dessert.  After I cleaned my plate/container I had to get the cook's attention to tell him face2face how amazing my meal was. I told him to get use to seeing me because my visits will quickly become routine. He thanked me but I made sure he knew how thankful I was to have finally found a Caribbean spot to bring my friends & family who love real Jamaican food.   Do yourself a real solid and stop by Ty's and order anything which interests you then prepare to be wowed.   I know I was!",

No seasoning I mean nothing but black pepper  then on top of that the presentation was awful!!! They warmed the mac and cheese up in the Microwave where the container plastic stuck to it. Then the salid they gave was only a pinch of it with spoiled dressin. I was disappointed very!!! I just moved to Charlotte, NC and what a start.",

Some of the sauce got on my finger and it was a wrap. But anyways, I checked out this great spot at the request of my cousin. She said their food was pretty good. So I agreed to go. Not disappointed at all! Let me start with the owner. He is very nice. We placed our order at 730 something. He made sure to tell me that he closes at 800. It was cool though cause I was right down the street. I ordered the Hennessy wings dinner with Mac and cheese and the peas and rice as my sides (sorry for all the \"and's\"). I also ordered a side of plantains. When I got my order it had greens instead of the rice. When I told him he gave me funny look (in a very nice way) and he said he'll get me the rice. He did forget about the plantains but that is fine because he did not charge me for them, so all is well. As I left he told my cousin don't bring me back this late again ( once again in a nice way). He is a really nice person. Now let's get to this plate of heaven that I just ordered. The Hennessy wings were not that Hennessy-e (yes I made it up!). But they were good. No buzz for you drinkers out there! The sides were the bomb as well. Now, being a Georgia girl I do have HIGH expectations for things like greens, sweet tea, etc. These greens were good. I did put some hot sauce on them but who wouldn't! The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food. Once again sorry about the pic. To make a long story short I LOVED this restaurant and will probably be going back tomorrow before 730 to get those plantains.",

They were the best wings i've ever tasted. My dad got the curry chicken with collard greens and fried okra. He loved the food said the curry chicken was amazing and had good flavor. The food didn't take long about 15 minutes. Definitely recommend this place!",

But today I was able to make my initial visit. The first person I got to talk to was Ty himself. Ty was a very down to earth and humble man.   We ordered our food and sat down in the dining area. The area was clean and well-kept. After about 10 minutes or so, Ty brought out food to us. It was piping hot and smelled delicious! My first first bite of the henny wings was magical. I knew this was a match made in heaven lol.   My wife had half teriyaki and henny wings. She loved hers as well. I had two sides with mine; the mac and cheese with the collard greens. Both were exquisite. I loved the portion size because I had another full meal out of this one.   All I can say is that Ty's Wings and Tings is the real deal. I hope to be a regular to this establishment so that I can try all of his other dishes. Come try it out, I know you'll love it too!",

However, the lemon pepper flavor doesn't disappoint.  The oxtails are small, tender and flavorful. Mac and cheese here is the ultimate comfort food.  Surprisingly the mac and cheese was moist and creamy. The rice and peas could improve. I'd definitely return to try additional menu items. Adding this to my top five Charlotte eateries.   * Staff is friendly, quick service and good sanitation score!",

When my mother arrived 30 minutes after the pick up time I was told that, \"We don't do time or grub hub orders\". Then why is there an option for this? This can't be the first occurrence and if that's the case maybe you should look into solving it. The man was of no help and provided absolutely no other options but to leave. I will definitely be spending my money elsewhere where they know what quality customer service is.",

    "text": "So I was craving Caribbean food and decided to try a new spot. Ima just cut right through the chase. I paid $20.98 for a Large Oxtail plate with Mac n cheese, collard greens, and a side of rice. The meal doesn't come with a drink so I paid for a bottled water.   The Food: Meh. It wasn't seasoned to my liking and the rice and peas kinda tasted like Italian seasoning or something. The greens were \"ok\" but again the seasoning was off for me. The Mac n cheese was good. The oxtails were disappointing. I received 6 skimpy, boney, fatty oxtails. They were over cooked and full of potatoes and carrots.    The Space: 96 sanitation score and sparse decorations. It was kinda hot and muggy in there as well.   The Value: Too much for too little. I could've eaten 3 times for $20 with way more food.   The Service: I was greeted when I came in. The only person working there was also the cook, cashier, and waiter. Not sure if that's how it always is but when I asked about the oxtails cook offered to bring me \"a couple more\" and explained they don't cut the meat. He did bring one and a half with potatoes.   The Experience: Underwhelmed. It was quiet, no music.   Overall not excited to return here. Maybe the wings were a better choice since people were ordering them but def not for oxtails.",

I'm the ultimate wing  lover and I am shocked this place doesn't have more traffic . Always the hidden gems that get overlooked.  What's also great about this place is the owner is superman, He rung us up and cooked our order fresh to go , all while keeping a cool, calm, and friendly deamanor .   Gonna leave the review short and sweet bc these wings will speak for themself . I can't comment on the other food because I only ordered wings ... In my terminator voice \"I'll be back\"",
