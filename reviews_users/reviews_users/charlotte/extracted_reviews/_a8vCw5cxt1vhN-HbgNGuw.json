Giving Rock Salt was new in town, and I had heard decent reviews saying the food was good, we chose them.  I can give them that, the food was good, but the problem was the price, service and the atmosphere. We sat outside, despite it being hot, simply because it was so darn LOUD inside.  it's just weird being in the middle of a parking lot. I know......I should have known that, but even so, it was weird. The service was just 'ok', nothing to write home about, and the drinks and cost of the entrees were a little pricey for what you got. Again, the food was good, but I think next time we'll choose a different spot. Just my 2-cents.",

Loved the cheese plate app. Scallops were OK, but slightly undercooked although presentation was great. Steak entree was not just bad, but awful. Wine menu was OK, lacked any of my favorite wines, but I am pretty picky.  Service was lackluster. I would describe our waiter as an \"a$$\". He had an attitude from the second we got there. You can't make your tables aware that your in a bad mood. Suck it up Dude!!",

    "text": "To be honest, I really want to give a higher rating, but I really wasn't blown away.  This place was on my list of bookmarks after a friend gave it a phenomenal review, then again for a YE event.  But this visit fell a bit short.   Parking is a work in progress but visiting mid-week just after work hours, it wasn't an issue.  I sat at the bar, ordering a Birdsong beer (Yes!) and perused the drink menu, which has a lot of fun wines I'd be interested in trying.  Food ordered was shrimp ceviche and a half dozen variety of roasted oysters.  The ceviche was ok, I was expecting a bit more citrus kick and less salsa topping.  It was nicely presented, but overly adorned with it sitting on toast and lettuce.  It sort of looked like they were going for lettuce wraps, but that's not what I ordered; just stick it in a little cup.  The roasted oysters I asked for 1 of each of the flavors, but got a couple duplicates.  As I mentioned I visited here about a month prior for a cocktail hour event and was wowed by some of the passed apps, roasted oysters being one of them.  This visit's food was just ok, and I would've liked to have tried all 6, but I didn't feel like complaining to get it corrected since I was hungry and didn't want to wait on another batch.   I would go back since I saw a lot of things on the menu I'd like to try, so check back for an update in the future.",

    "text": "*Only 1 type of oyster offered*  Not what i was expecting. I was expecting fresh seafood entrees and great oysters. It was a disappointing. There was only a few options for Raw seafood- ONE kind of oyster, no ceviches or tartares, etc. I am not sure what niche they are trying to fit into. Everything was just *okay*.   Oyster presentation looked anemic. Just lemons and mignoette juice (that didnt even look proper and barely enough), no crackers, no hot sauce. I love my oysters pure, but my partner was looking for more- if youre gonna cal yourself RockSalt you gotta bring a good seafood game. Mussels were fine but again limited- only one flavor profile (thai curry). Caviar was good. Came with a bag of store bought chips- kinda cool but i think homemade potato chips would've been better. They had a cheese/fish dip where i could not taste the fish.   In general, i dont see myself going back. There wasnt anything that really stood out. Lack of variety for fresh oysters/seafood was biggest sore point. Prices too high for uninspired menu.   Service was good tho. But space was too loud and too bright. Tiny place and kitchen is open and up in the grill.  Not for date night.  Not sure what this place would be most appropriate for.",

Secondly, the wine selection is superb it compliments their menu perfectly with all their fare. Third the craftsmanship of their dishes- my dinner looked too pretty to eat!  I can say more but you have to give this place a shot... If you want something out of the norm.... A place that doesn't have ranch dressing but instead housemade vinaigrette that will open your senses!  Give your taste buds something new and special. Locally sourced and sustainable seafood!  Yummmmy. Wish they had endless crab cakes. Ha! #eatlocal",

I had the crabcake which comes w/a grit cake & creamed spinach.  It was the blandest meal  I've ever had.  Perfect for anyone who has dietary restrictions.  My partner had the steak which was accompanied w/beet greens & usually grits.  He subbed the potatoes.  Again devoid of salt or any type of spice.  We were seated at the bar so watched as the mussels & oysters were being shucked.  I'm from Seattle & haven't seen an order that doesn't go out w/hot sauce & crackers.  Ppl were having to ask for both.  Suggestions - add the grit cake as a side item.  Find the spice cabinet - a little garlic or even adding onion would help.  There is plenty of seating & sitting at the bar we did have decent service.  We were told when we entered everything else was taken though half the outside tables were empty & 1/4 of the inside tables.  They did not fill while we were there.",

I am no foodie but I can really dig my real into a fun restaurant with a good atmosphere. Rock Salt was just that! My husband and I am here (kid free!!) and had a platter, some small plates, the grilled romaine lettuce salad, and some amazing wine that they recommended. Everything was delicious! My all-time favorite, though, was the fresh berries and funnel cake dessert. Yes you read that right...FUNNEL CAKE! It was probably the best dessert I've ever had. Still thinking about it days later. Yum! We will definitely come back to relax on the patio again. Thanks to Rock Salt for making our date night/birthday celebration absolutely perfect!!! Your food is incredible and your wait staff is on point! See you again very soon!",

    "text": "My first thought about the restaurant was that it was a very unique location and they had done an incredible job of converting and old dry cleaners into an upscale raw bar. I am sure that the patio is going to be a great place to be this summer.  Getting beyond the restaurants excellent visual aesthetics I was very disappointed with my dining  experience.   I dined at the restaurant on a Tuesday around 8:30 pm. It was not very busy so I did not notice an issue with noise that Kim N. had mentioned that evening. On a previous occasion when I stopped to check the menu it was packed and I could barely hear the host talking to me as I was standing directly in front of her. I gave my drink order to the waitress and several minutes later she returned to the table to ask me if I wanted my cocktail on the rocks. This was a new question for me because I have never had someone ask me that about a mixed drink. Ten minutes later she arrived with the drink, in a glass which I would describe as being rather small for a mixed cocktail that cost $13 dollars.   I asked about market fish and steak for the day and she said she would have to check and she left the table. I could see the special board from my table but I could not read it because I left my glasses in the car. Several minutes later she returned and told me the specials. I started to place my order with her for \"The GreenWay\" when she informed me that they were out of oysters. This was after I had been sitting at the table for about 30 minutes. With out asking why they were out she stated that the Chesapeake was frozen over and they were unable to get oysters from their supplier. It was apparent this was not the first time she had spoken that sentence in regards to their lack of oysters.   I don't fault them for having supplier issues. It has been an unusually cold winter and the Chesapeake bay and Rappahannock river have been frozen over. To some extent this happens almost every winter so they need to be prepared for this every winter. I don't fault them for running out of Oysters on a Tuesday it is possible they had been very busy.   However, when you have the words \"Raw Oyster Bar\" in the name of your business, and you don't have oysters! You should let every customer who walks in the door know that you are out of oysters before they sit at their table. There is an incredibly good chance good chance that they came to your restaurant seeking the one item you are out of.   I settled for the \"Lamb and Clams\" appetizer. I was expecting little neck sized clams and instead they were past neck sized clams and the lamb was a little dry and overcooked. I asked for bread to soak up the broth and was flatly told that they do not have bread. I kind of feel like my server was lying to me because after reading a review by Partick A. where he stated \"Lamb and Clam Starter was worth the night out and ask for extra bread for soppin'.\" So Rock Fish tell me do you or do you not have bread?  For my main course I selected the \"Bowl of Mussels\", the mussels were a good size and had a great flavor and the broth was excellent. However more than a few of the mussels were under cooked and they were a little raw. The shells were not fully opened on some of them as well. My dinner guest had decided upon the \"Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops\", which were excellent with a great flavor and good size. The listed side item with the scallops was crushed potatoes. I am not sure what a crushed potato is but the scallops actually came with whole  roasted fingerling type potatoes which were very good.   In summary, it is a good location. The restaurant is visually appealing. The service was wanting almost sub par. Two of the three items I experienced were lacking and the drinks were a little over priced.   Would I eat there again? Probably not for a full dinner again. Would I recommend it to a friend? Depends on the friend and the situation.",

We sat on the patio, which was nice, other than the fact it's basically in the middle of a parking lot.   Service was solid throughout the night. No issues here unlike what others have experienced.   Food was average. We ordered a cheese and charcuterie plate which was pretty good, not incredible though. For entrees, we got the crab cakes, ribeye and a lamb bolognese pasta special. Out of the three the pasta was the best no doubt. The ribeye was below average, meat wasn't top quality and it was way over cooked. The crab cakes were just average.   I honestly expected more out of this place. Given the average nature of everything, I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon.",

I made reservations for an indoor table, and when we arrived at our reservation time, there weren't any indoor tables available. Not wanting to wait a while to get a table, we took an outdoor table. It only took a couple minutes before we ordered drinks - and that was the last we saw of any wait staff. After waiting 15 minutes for our drinks or even to order, we got up and left. The table next to us, that was seated just moments before us, had 4 visits from 2 different wait staff and had their drinks delivered and meals ordered during that same 15 minutes. I guess if you don't dress like you're going clubbing afterwards you don't get any service. Anyway, if you actually want to get served at a restaurant, don't go here.",

    "text": "Seated on the plastic sheeted patio, and we very comfortable with the heaters running.  Our server was ever so pleasant and competent, but we noticed she did not have any other tables outside, so we did not see her as often as we would have liked.  Oyster stew for starter was exceptional, really filling and creamy. The grilled oysters were not our favorites.  There were 6 total, 3 different varieties, and we felt the ingredients added did nothing for the oysters.  Waited 45 minutes between finishing starters and receiving entree.  The individual who \"presented\" the meal literally threw the plates on the table. That was startling, but then so was the presentation.  We realize this is a farm to table restaurant, so the sizes will be considerably smaller, and served on smaller plates as well.  But the scallops were embarrassing.  4 medium sized served on the side of the plate, leaving the remaining 2/3's of the plate bare.  My steak was equally small, but served on a bed of purple smashed cauliflower which didn't make it look as odd.  Steak had to be sent back for being terribly undercooked, and the replacement was served swiftly.  There was a stingy amount of bernaise sauce and the entire meal was under seasoned.  The tables should have salt and pepper on table if this is how meals are prepared.  Dessert was a very strange flavored and textured panna cotta and chocolate cake.  As if to continue the strange servings, the cake came out almost deconstructed.  3 clumps of cake was so odd, but tasted delicious.  Waited a considerable amount of time for check,  over charged $5, but we had spent 2 hours there at this point and just wanted to leave.  Husband was still hungry upon arriving home and put frozen pizza in oven.  Overall a missed opportunity to turn us into regulars, sad.",

I made a reservation on Opentable and in the comments I noted that we would need a high chair if possible. The front of the house called a few hrs later and said they don't have high chairs but they could give us a booth so a booster seat could be used. So heads up on that. They do have a kids menu though. The seating is really tight in there so that's probably why there are no high chairs.  Looks very cool from the outside and the patio will fit lots of people. It does just overlook the parking lot though.  Full bar with some local beer available. I got three oysters (they were only offering one variety) and two jumbo shrimp. Good oysters with three sauces but the shrimp were NOT jumbo at all. The greens that come with the crab cake were awesome! Think it was spinach but had some bite. The trout was overpriced, but prepared well. I think I just was hoping for a better experience.",

The food took forever, and when it showed up, the following was our experience: BURNED biscuit with undercooked chicken (which, by the way was tiny and was $15); \"side of bacon\" consisted of 3 bacon coins the size of quarters; $15 brunch plate with one slice of bacon, half of which was complete fat and inedible, a spoonful of grits, and one dry scrambled egg. The \"mom-osas\" touted fresh squeezed OJ, yet I watched the bartender pour one after the other from a Tropicana jug. The replacement chicken biscuit took another 10 minutes. And guess what? Not a simple offer to comp anything. NEVER going back",

    "text": "Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want this review to be five stars but I just can't.... yet!  Here's what works: Location - awesome and super close to home for me Hours & Menu - dinner AND brunch?  Yes please! Libations - mmmmm, drinks are on point  Here's what I would love to see some improvement on: Food - the food has all of the bones to be GREAT, but for some reason it just doesn't quite have the pizazz you hope for.  The breakfast Sammie is an excellent example.  It's this HUGE sandwich with scrambled eggs, thick bacon, pimento cheese, all on a beautiful roll.  Sounds astonishing, right?  Wellllllllll the sandwich was so large/tall you can't actually bite it - and when you try, all of the scrambled eggs fall out (hint hint, try fried eggs!), the pimento cheese was wayy to tart/vinegary - not savory like you would hope for, and the bacon was thick but mostly fat and not crispy - I ended up pulling it off and just eating the meat, and even that tasted more like pork than bacon.  Overall a fantastic idea, but the execution could be better.  It left me wanting more.    Same with the roasted cauliflower - I found myself looking for salt and pepper to add some flavor to it.   In summary, I would certainly go back, and this place has all of the makings to be phenomenal.",

    "text": "I am going to try to be as honest as I can. My friend wanted to try this place and we walked in and the drink menu is 3x the food menu. So, right away i was nervous.  We both started with five shrimp cocktail shrimps over ice. I bit into the first one and it was mushy and had some sort of slimy taste. Than, I actually picked another up and smelled it. It was fishy smelling and that did it for me. Neither one of us ate it.  I ordered a burger figuring \"how can you mess up a burger\" - well, they did! I ordered it medium and it comes out rare. I sent it back and it comes out well done. Finally I am pissed off.   My friend orders the scallops and they come out undercooked to his taste. So, he sends his back and again due to the taste, does not eat it and to make the waitress feel better he hides two under the side item.  The Manger finally comes over and she's arguing with me that their meat is different and tends to more on the red or colorful side. Again, pissed off. Why argue with me when you can simply say \"sorry\".  The only reason I am leaving two stars is because she took off my burger and she said she took off the shrimp but we didn't even eat them. So no big deal.",

    "text": "RockSalt has one big thing going for them - seafood, especially the raw oysters (I'm a sucker for raw oysters). Now I know with this kind of food and dining it isn't going to be a cheap outing and the food is always very delicious.   They offer $1 oysters during certain hours of the week, so I took advantage and ordered 3. We also ordered the Cheese & Charcuterie with 2 cheeses and 1 meat and unfortunately this is where the issue began. Unlike many people out there who are allergic to a lot of foods, I am only allergic to one - cherries - and when I see a little red fruit on anything, I instantly HAVE to know what it is before touching. We asked 1 server since our server was helping another table and he made a joke out of it and walked away. I wasn't convinced so asked our server as well. She wasn't sure and went in and asked. It was in fact cherries and informed me not to eat them but she was going to leave the plate on the table! We had to ask her to take it to refresh that side since I couldn't eat it. The did offer to make us a new plate but it was smaller than the first plate... Oh well, it still tasted great!  I then ordered the scallops which were delicious and my boyfriend ordered the burger. We enjoyed our meal out on the patio. While definitely pricey and a slight hiccup to the night, I will still come back.",

    "text": "I think my 5-star rating is based on several factors:  1. Our reservation was purposely made at a time that would coincide with the $1 oyster happy hour.  What a deal. Great oysters on the half shell.  We ate a bunch. 2. We were celebrating my husband's 50th, and everyone was in a wonderful mood, including the birthday boy! 3. Our reservation was on a Tuesday.  As much as I enjoy a bustling restaurant scene, a slower night was perfect for conversation as well as good service.  All servers - bartender, gentleman at the shucking station, and servers that worked our table -  were excellent.  Very friendly, and generally attentive.  Service was well-timed and not pushy.  We enjoyed an amazing assortment of oysters and managed to throw down 3 1/2 dozen among the 6 of us.  Good quality oysters, and interesting variety of flavors.   We tried a variety of small plates, including an octopus special (potatoes and sauces), blistered shishitos (slightly spicy and salty, with orange zest), Toad in the Hole (egg in a thick slice bread basket with smoked trout, aioli, caviar- awesome idea), and brussels sprouts caesar (fire roasted dressed with caesar dressing and parm).  One person ordered the gorgeous cheese and charcuterie platter (nice presentation), 2 ordered trout, and I ordered the tuna tartare (really amazing recipe, perfect amount of fire roasted bread alongside).  I love that you don't get \"over-breaded\" here, and that they decided to just be different and not offer boring green salads.  Hey, if you're going for a fine seafood dinner, the fish and shellfish are the stars!  Decor is urban-rustic, a combination of low and high seating, with a nice patio.  It was a great celebration, and we really liked it.  We will be back, definitely for another oyster happy hour!",

The man and I went on a double date and the other couple was already seated (with a round of oysters!) by the time we arrived. Before we ventured out I had already reviewed the menu and knew what I wanted to get. To start I tried the roasted oysters, 2 of each variety. The best by far was the Bienville. I freely admit I am still an oyster novice and I appreciated smothering them with cheese. The boyfriend sampled a bunch of their oysters (on special for $1 until the end of 2015). My favorite of the raw oysters was the sting ray.  For my main I went with the scallops which were expertly seasoned and seared. So delicious! Unfortunately the beans were very undercooked, but the collards and broth were delicate and delicious. The boyfriend's amberjack and the side of spinach greens he got were tasty.  The dinner itself, though a little pricy, was worthy of a 4 star review. However I have to knock a star off because of the slow service and the way the bill was split. When the waitress asked if we wanted one check we asked for separate checks (one check for each couple) and when she returned she had split the bill total down the middle. Efficient for them I suppose but we weren't a large party and it made everyone uncomfortable. However since we had been there for 2 hours and had a movie to catch we didn't push the issue.",

But when we ordered a beer, another server came back and was flabbergasted because they don't serve what was ordered. That's fine - we ordered a different beer then waited and waited. We were seated at a table and still no beer. We ordered oysters and some sides then the beer finally arrived. Our server was nice but went missing after we ordered our food. The place is pretty small but we didn't see her around. This bugged me because I ordered a side of greens in miso broth but never got a spoon. I sat around waiting until she showed up and gave me a spoon. It's not a big deal but these little annoyances kept adding up. We spent $160 for a party of 3 so I expected better service.",

The server was totally overwhelmed and under prepared. She told me they were still having problems with the oysters Rockefeller and Bienville coming out room temperature. It was a Chinese fire drill and an expensive one at that The food was spotty at best.I emailed them at the Virginia location but got no response. Unless I hear through the grapevine that it's better.

From the hostess who sat us, to our fabulous server Allison (highly recommend asking for her because her knowledge about the food source, preparation, portion sizes, etc. was extraordinary), and even the chefs who popped out to check on us, everyone was very attentive to our needs. I enjoyed porgy (a fish I had not had before) pan seared with the skin on, which I normally would shy away from but this fish was delicious and crispy. Nothing we ate smelled fishy, the oysters were great (tried all three types). Scallops were large, delicious and served with a fabulous sauce and quality bacon, barbequed okra was a surprise hit. Prosecco on draft was a nice treat, as was the dark chocolate mousse, which tasted like dark chocolate cheesecake presented in a mason jar.

    "text": "We live in the neighborhood and walked over for an afternoon drink and appetizer. The hostess was very nice. Our server didn't know the drink menu. There were 4 specialty drinks and she couldn't explain them. Overall, we think she was a little \"green\" for this higher priced restaurant. My wife wanted a margarita and they don't make that. The crab cake was good but for $26, not sure. The grit cake was tasty. We enjoyed sharing this with a Hop Drop and a glass of Prosecco. We sat on the patio - very nice experience. The menu appeals to a niche audience and since we don't do the raw bar thing, we had limited options. Just throw a burger and some flat bread on there. Next time, we are going back for the cheese board and a bottle of wine. They lost one star for price and one star for the \"green\" but very nice server. Otherwise, we enjoyed the experience. This place could really take off with some menu additions. Go there and check it out for yourself.",

Food was definitely not memorable, but the prices were. Waitress was not fully trained and could not explain menu items and service was slow. If this place wants to be a high end restaurant, it has a lot of work to do. Would be surprised if it makes it more than one year.",

He just came over asked for drink orders, came back with the drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered and then I overhear the waiter at the table next to us explaining in detail about all the specials.  Why didn't our waiter tell us???  My husband ordered the mussels and didn't eat 90% because he thought they smelled and tasted bad.  He is now worried he will be sick tonight.  I had the crab cake and with each bite I had to pull shell out of my mouth.  So, I stopped eating at bite 4.  My food was very bland and was in need of some spices.  Basically we overpaid for a meal and then had to come home and fix dinner for ourselves.  Wouldn't recommend.",

    "text": "1 star is being generous. I typically don't write reviews, but couldn't help but write one after my recent visit to RockSalt. Our server, while attentive kept making comments about getting our birthday guest drunk, which is quite frankly, rude, and distasteful. The menu lacked any character, and wasn't anything special, and the prices are RIDICULOUS for a restaurant in the middle of a parking lot with a lackluster atmosphere inside. It was hard to even hear at a table of four, and the restaurant wasn't even very full. Drink prices are absurd, but the guests I dined with enjoyed the custom cocktails (4 options). Now to dinner... they were out of mussels. I chose the \"NC Trout\" which was flat out disgusting. It tasted as though it had been sitting in a cooler for two weeks, and it was topped with \"Texas caviar\" (blackeyed peas) that were hard as rocks. Definitely nothing fresh about it. I let my server know who offered to remake it, but who wants something else after having bad fish???? I would have though that being a new restaurant they would have comped my meal, but nope. I paid $25 bucks for the one bite I gagged down. The guests I dined with enjoyed their scallops, but said the sides were just ok. The same was to be said for the crab cake entree. Save your time and go to Upstream - Much better selection, better prices, and better seafood. I came home and had a pb&j. Highly disappointed in this one, and will not be recommending it to my friends.",

Whoever that person was, immediately went back to their phone once we were sat. At the bar it took about five minutes for the bartender to finish her conversation with another staff member to come over and speak to us, which is odd because we were the only ones sitting there. The drinks came out promptly as well as the appetizer which was the ONE positive. We ordered lambs and clams and out of the six clams one of the shells was destroyed, which typically means that the shellfish is bad, so we only ate 5 of the clams and were never asked about the food. Unfortunately we spent $45 here on poor food and to our greater dissatisfaction, poor service, on two drinks and an app. We left shortly after and arrived at Good Food to be immediately greeted with a smile and fantastic service where our presence is welcomed and money given generously.",

But I did expect a better selection than was presented. The staff was enthusiastic enough, however not versed well enough in the menu or silverware presentation, which is a pet peeve of mine. If you're going to charge premium prices for food and service, at least give me the proper utensils. I ordered a bowl of the root vegetable chili and was given a spoon that would not fit into the small bowl. It was the size of a serving spoon. At first I thought is was a joke, but quickly realized that the waitress was just that inexperienced. I asked for a replacement and was finally given a spoon that fit the bowl. For what I did get, it was quite tasty. My wife was a little disappointed at the oyster selection and presentation. Hopefully in time RockSalt will pull it all together and have a long run here in the Queen City.",

First the good- the outside patio was nice to sit on, the drinks were good,my husband enjoyed his raw oysters, and the lamb pasta was ok. The bad- everything is very overpriced, the menu is small and it was hard to pick something that I wanted to order, the oyster stew my husband got made me gag it was so bad. It came out and was extremely watery. It tasted like milk with oysters dumped into it and fake smoke. Other than the smoke there was no seasoning (including salt). $110 later we left angry that with all the good restaurants in charlotte we had wasted our anniversary dinner here.",

With that said my experience at rocksalt was amazing, The food was just amazing, combination of simplicity and loads of flavor. Order the Roasted oysters bienville, ceviche as an appetizer, I still drool just thinking about them. For the main dish we ordered the black bass and the pink snapper with smoked grits, collards with pork belly and brussel sprouts on general tso sauce. While it was delicious, I couldn't help to think about the whole fish that was served to neighboring table; which I'll probably try soon. But we didn't end there, since we also got the \"Dirty\" Chocolate Pudding. Now I can think of chocolate or pudding in any other way. It was amazing. Recommendation if you go on a Sunday, try to do it on a sunny day sit on the outside patio and just enjoy the great food this place has to offer.",

I have to agree with the noise level. The feng shui is off a bit. the ambiance needs adjusting. There was a terrible draft and the lighting is bright. The kids menu had four things...grilled cheese, butter noodles, veggie sticks with dip and trout. I ordered the chowder which was curdled. The lamb app was dry, the steak was overcooked and the creme brule' was greasy, eggy and not creamy at all.  If this was being reviewed by someone in the culinary world, they would have been eaten alive. I remain hopeful. Maybe some of the kinks will be worked out by the time the warm season comes.",

One salty, one sweet, paired with fresh horseradish and mignonette. We then went for the chilled shrimp and I know you've all had shrimp cocktail before but this was different...the shrimp so big and plump but so tender and juicy at the same time. A must order (you can order by the piece). They came with a house made cocktail sauce which was divine. For appetizers we went with lambs and clams, a standout dish that got better with each bite; their special which was soft shell crab, broccoli slaw and peach bbq (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>); and hot and sour crab soup. I ordered the grass fed NY strip which was wood grilled medium rare and served with fatback braised radish tops, white cheddar grits and chimichurri. This dish was killer and I must say the radish greens stole the show. I'm a carnivore but not on this night. They were so smoky and salty and just made my taste buds dance. My buddy got the black grouper with grapefruit and fennel slaw with sweet potatoes and some hog jowl. Damn that dish was good too, the one or 2 bites i got. His wife ordered the Chesapeake crab cakes paired with a grit cake and creamed spinach, which she devoured so I didn't try them, but I'll take her word for it. For dessert we had the dirt cake; a play on a southern childhood fav, chocolate pudding, cake crumble, house made gummy worms, and micro mint leaves, and opted for their new dessert the peach hand pie with vanilla ice cream and bourbon caramel. Both were stellar. Hats off to chef Jay and the rest of the team. Charlotte is lucky to have you guys here!",

The restaurant was moderately full but certainly not jammed with patrons.  My wife and I were greeted quickly and offered either indoor or outdoor seating. We opted for outdoor due to my wife's previous experience with the noise level inside. After 10 minutes our waitress took drink order. She returned 15 minutes later to ask if we were ready to order dinner although we were still waiting for our drinks. She apologized that they only had one bartender. One bartender on a weekend dinner service running 25 minutes behind? We ordered oysters and smoked trout roe as appetizers. Oysters were arguably the smallest oysters I have ever seen, smaller than a typical cherry stone clam. The roe was good but served with a bag of potato chips, a bag of potatoes chips for $29! I had the fish of the day which was amberjack and my wife had the scallops. She enjoyed the scallops very much. The amberjack however was cold and raw in the middle. I typically enjoy fish medium but this was actually raw and drowning in salt. Served with Swiss chard that was also so heavily salted as to be inedible.   We finished quickly and moved on to dessert elsewhere, leaving the menus that the waitress had never bothered to pick up from our table behind.  Great concept, very poor execution",

The menu I find confusing, as so much of it is not seafood oriented. I've had a number of dishes and nothing has been great, and prices are definitely higher end. There's an \"off-menu\" burger that was highly recommended and I didn't eat much of it. Pretty bad, crazy dry and over cooked.  Service has been indifferent at times, kind of rude and snotty at others.   I don't get this place.",

    "text": "This was a terrible experience. My boyfriend and I just wanted a place to go on a Monday night (3/12) for a nice drink and a couple of small plates. We booked our reservation through open table for 9:30 since reservations were recommended. Given that reservations were accepted this late we weren't thinking we'd be pushed out of the restaurant so aggressively by our server this night. We were greeted by a girl who asked for our reservation and sat us (Sarah from PA - had only been in training 4 days.) She had been very friendly and spoke with us about the weather being so cold. We all commiserated on being northerners trying to escape the cold but still being stuck in it in the south.   We thought we were off to a pretty nice start but then our actual waitress came over. She didn't say hello, smile or introduce herself to us. She said, \"You guys have a reservation?\" To which we confirmed and said jokingly it didn't seem necessary given how empty the restaurant was. She responded with, \" well yeah that's because we close at 10. What do you want to drink?\" My boyfriend asked for suggestions and ordered the no preservations. I then asked HOW another drink was and since she clearly was not interested in dealing with us she repeated he drink order and took off running. My boyfriend had to stop her and repeat, \" My girlfriend asked HOW the drink was.\" The waitress responded with a curt \"it's great.\" Since I felt like I didn't really have time to look or ask questions I ordered the peach jalapeno drink. At this point, I mentioned to my boyfriend that I tend to be overly critical of waitstaff having spent 10 years serving and bartending but he also agreed that this waitress was nothing short of rude and unwelcoming especially given how much money we had intended to initially spend.  After she put the drinks in, she came back to the table and said, \"Do you know what you want the kitchen closes soon?\" Thankfully, we had looked at the menu in advance and knew what we kind of wanted. However, we changed gears and decided to only order something small and take our business elsewhere. We had initially decided to give Rock Salt a try over Sea Level and we immediately regretted it because of this server. We ordered a few of the oysters, shrimp cocktail and cornbread. When the waitress went to take the menus, my boyfriend asked to keep one just in case he wanted to order something else. She said sure - and reinforced that the kitchen closed at 10. At this point it was very clear the kitchen closed at 10 and we were very unwelcome at this establishment. After she placed our order, she brought our drinks. Never checked on if we liked them or not, never asked if we would like another. The food came fast and one plate at a time. While we were waiting Sarah stopped by the table again and we asked her what she thought of the menu and the chefs dinner. She provided a lot of information and let us know that she had only been training for 4 days but we couldn't tell, she was incredibly pleasant.   Once our last plate hit the table, my boyfriend asked for the check, which was delivered quicker than anything and he immediately presented her with a card to close out. We left her 10% because of how uncomfortable our meal was. We wish we could have given the money to Sarah instead.  When we left my boyfriend said thanks and to let the girl from PA know thanks and to have a good night. Our waitress looks at the bartender and says,\" we have a girl from PA?\" The bartender then says \"yes - Sarah.\" The waitress responds with, \" oh that's her name...How did I not know she was from PA?\" There were only 3 people working front of house that night, apparently this waitress is just a very unpleasant person and treats both guests and employees with incredible disrespect. There were only 3 people we saw working - a brunette bartender, Sarah - a server in training and our server who never introduced herself with a blonde ponytail.  If you don't want people staying past 10pm, don't allow for 9:30 reservations.   If your waitresses don't want to serve people past a certain time, don't allow to be your closing person.  We left with such a poor taste in our mouth from this experience, we immediately went to another place (merchant and trade in uptown) where the staff was so friendly and informative that we spent the rest of the night there and a couple hundred dollars we were initially planning to spend in Rock Salt.",

The menu was great- the food was wonderful and artfully and thoughtfully prepared, the atmosphere was relaxing, but sophisticated, the service was friendly and enthusiastic (although our server left some room for improvement is not being 100% attentive). Rocksalt is a terrific restaurant and among Charlotte's best. I look forward to dining there again, very soon!",

    "text": "What has happened to ROCKSALT?  Historically one of our favorite restaurants, we arrived for our designated reservation time and were greeted and seated promptly. That was the end of the positives of our experience.   My wife and I had a lovely conversation and realized we had been sitting for 30 minutes and hadn't been brought a glass of water, nothing. Finally a nice young lady came over and apologized for the delay. Ok, we are out for a night out, no big deal. We ordered some cocktails, inquired about gluten in some of the appetizers and waited. Thirty minutes later we still did not have our drinks and no answers about our questions. The explanation upon return is there is only one bartender, apparently an incompetent one at that. Our server apologized again, said the manager was going to come chat with us. The \"manager\"dropped two drinks on the table and said, \"these are on me\", not much of an apology, candidly we just wanted to eat. We ordered the Mid Country boil for $18, the portion size was laughable, desperate to eat we ordered the fresh catch, which actually arrived relatively quickly, the food however was bland, tasteless and tiny. The $26 per plate seems like it should warrant more than a three ounce piece of fish, unfortunately our waitress also dissuaded us from ordering sides.  She also forgot to bring us the glass of wine we ordered to have with dinner. So, we left with $100 tab and hungry.   What a horrible experience, needless to say, we will be unlikely to return anytime soon.",

    "text": "We went to RockSalt Saturday night for the first time (and last).  The outside of the restaurant looks very cool and modern.    Upon arrival, I informed the hostess that we had a reservation (booked through OpenTable).  She regretfully said that the only seating they had indoors was the one that was closer to the front door than the hostess stand was.  So, we asked to sit outside on their huge patio area, even though it was a bit chilly that night without a jacket.  (By the way, OpenTable contacted me afterwards and said I was a \"no show\" for my reservation...sigh...)  Another reason we preferred sitting outside is that immediately upon entering, we realized there was zero atmosphere about the dining room, it was too brightly lit, and it looked and sounded like a cafeteria.  The acoustics were so awful that had we sat inside, we never would have been able to have a conversation.  The outside patio area is very nice and spacious underneath a pergola, although I don't understand why they didn't have outdoor heaters for guests.  We shivered a little bit, but were thankful not to have to deal with the extremely loud din from the interior of the restaurant (although you could still hear it muffled from outside, sounding exactly like a cafeteria).  The menu seemed quite limited (and they were apparently out of mussels).  Nothing jumped out as me as \"wow!\"  At same restaurants, I have to narrow down my choice.  At RockSalt, I had some trouble picking one.    I ordered the sea scallops.  I must say that the scallops were absolutely delicious.  They were so flavorful, and I savored each bite.   The scallops also came with \"crushed potatoes,\" which weren't hot from the start, but also tasted like they had reheated from a previous night.  There was also a kale & cabbage slaw.    My partner ordered the steak because the fish options seemed too limited, unless you like bones in your fish.  It looked quite fatty, but he said it tasted good.    Anyway, because the restaurant has zero atmosphere inside, the menu limited, and the prices are way too high for what customers get in return, we won't be back to RockSalt.    p.s. A note to RockSalt - the sidewalk out front is an accident waiting to happen.  When you leave the restaurant and head toward the parking lot, there's a curb where there shouldn't be one (it should just be all flat), and someone is bound to trip and fall.  Just sayin' - get your lawyers ready.",

My Cosmopolitan was good and so was my hubbys Green Hornet...until he found a long piece of hair wrapped around his straw. Disgusting!! I didn't want to continue our meal but reluctantly did. Of course the drink was replaced and taken off our bill.   The Pear Salad, really? The ingredients were odd and didn't go together. Our bad for ordering it. The Crab Cake did have a lot of crab meat but had a weird consistency. The Roasted Oysters, which I was most excited for, were just ok. They should broil them or something. Who wants a semi warm oyster with a dab of bbq sauce? Go the extra mile, you're an oyster bar! The Oyster Chowder was probably the best item we tried. We also shared the Simple Fish Scallop dinner. Scallops could have been bigger and weren't seared on both sides and the side or Califlower was gross with that sauce on the bottom.   I wouldn't recommend this place and won't be back.",

The misters and fans were going, keeping it cool for us. Once the sun started to set, the tiki torches were lit (no smell, kept the bugs away).   We missed Oyster Happy Hour, but still had to taste them. We had two of each and will be back for $1 oysters soon. Sharing the small plates, we sampled several dishes. Toad in the Hole was a unique treat and the smoked trout was on point. I could drink the caper aioli, it was so delish. The kale with peanuts was a good side. The Lamb & Clam Casino was great for sharing and had four huge clams, served in their shells. The lamb sausage had just enough bite to make the dish pop.   The GM really made the experience for us. Jessica suggested a rose that went well with everything we ate. We asked if they did anything to celebrate a birthday, she surprised us and sent out two glasses of champagne.  Elite customer service, neighborhood local in the back lot of Park Road Shopping Center, quality seafood.",

Sure they don't ever recognize me, or ever give me the same waiter (they might have high turnover), but who cares? I LOVE the oysters! I got a raw bar sampler dish once, which was also great. Ceviche is great too, even though they don't give you crackers or anything to eat it with - flavor is great. They have a nice wine list, and usually do a bottle because the pricing isn't terrible. We often come here just for oysters and then go to dinner elsewhere, as the meals are small and expensive here. I can't say what else is good other than raw bar stuff, but it always looks delicious. Also, pro tip - this place is NEVER crowded and has a great patio. If you have a last minute date or don't want to have to fight crowds, this place is perfect. I will continue to go back here, whether I get the deal or not the oysters (3 types) are delicious and great quality. My mom and I go here every time she's in town, great mom daughter date spot!",

    "text": "So disappointing! ROCKSALT was one of my favorite places in Charlotte for oysters but it has gone WAY down hill.  I hadn't been in a while and me and a friend decided to go last night to celebrate her birthday.  First, I ordered a martini and it was served to me in a champagne glass?!?! Not a flute, but a glass.  If you know how small these glasses are, you would be upset, as I was, that the drink didn't even fill the glass half way.  When I asked the bartender where the martini glasses were, he stated they were all broken.  The martini was $12!!!!  I've paid $12 for martinis elsewhere in SouthPark and have been happy but this was half of a half of a drink.  We ordered the grilled oyster appetizer.  Six oysters came out.  Two were scallion, 2 barbecue and 2 were bourbon.  They were horrible!  The flavors did not work together at all.  The scallion were tolerable.  For my entree, I ordered the Chesapeake Platter, which was so disappointing...the clams were the size of quarters, the shrimp were a decent size, the oysters were small and not very flavorful and the crab salad had more tomatoes than crab salad.  So Not worth it!  For $150 I honestly left feeling like I was ripped off.  I will not be patronizing ROCKSALT again.",

Turns out the owner of Rocksalt is the owner of a hundred year old plus oyster harvesting company on the coast so they bring their own product in. They had three kinds to choose from, I got the bigger sweeter ones and they were some of the best oysters I have had anywhere in the world. They presented them with a cup of the mignontette vinegar along with their own grated horseradish and cocktail sauce. Outstanding. Also has a few of the tiny clams raw and some jumbo chilled shrimp. Also very good. Then tried the pimento dip with little crusty bread pieces, also great. Finished with the cheeseburger. It comes out looking like a $16 slider but the truth is, the burger is quite thick and is made from a custom hand packed mix of brisket and sirloin. Amazingly good burger and sloppy messy. The sides were kinda weird modern things but I had the greens in miso which was good. Overall there is not a whole lot on this menu as far as entrees but everything I had was great and the service at the bar was really good. Nice drink selection and impressive selection of local drafts also. I will come back here next time I am passing through Charlotte.",

Another person in our party ordered it and when they brought she got a fish 2x! the size. And the guy who brought it had the nerve to say \"We weigh them and they are same...\". LOL. Wtf. Liar. The only thing worth ordering here is the burger. At a seafood restaurant. Dollar oysters could be worth it, otherwise don't waste your time. The wine came 40 minutes late for the wives. Done.

Our first course came our at 9:45. We both got the grilled oysters. They were on the fishy side. We then waited  over an hour for our main course. While we were waiting, the table on our right was comped for their meal because it was gross. The table on our left also was complaining. At 11:05 we finally got our main course... my \"trout\" tasted like unseasoned cat food. My husband got the pork cheeks that tasted like instant gravy mixed with salsa with bacon in it. We were still hungry when we got home. Unfortunately, we will not be back.",

They blamed the delay on OpenTable overbooking them, but they should have been monitoring their bookings and been prepared. We talked to a couple who were leaving and they told us not to wait, that they waited 30 minutes past their reservation, waited 45 minutes for their food and then it was cold. They also reported that when they complained about the cold food the staff simply reheated their fish. This was a terrible experience.",

I hate that Im going to be really mean but I feel like I have to be completely honest and it was just that terrible of an experience.   We came here for my birthday dinner with the in-laws and we were all so so so disappointed after our almost $200 dollar meal ( with out drinks!).  We saw the bad reviews on yelp and we were going to stay away but a near by restaurant ( that we love) had a long wait and we were starving so we ended up coming here.   First I want to say that the hostess girl is so rude. She is by far one of the rudest, most unfriendly hostess ever. I have no idea why she is working there. She seems like she hates her job.   The servers were slow and not helpful at all. Seems like there was a manager working there too but she looked like she had no idea what was going on and was running around confused.  On to the terrible food...  We ordered the raw oysters and roasted oysters for appetizer and my oh my they were the tiniest oysters I have EVER seen! The oysters were the size of half of my pinky ( and I have really small hands)! They were so tiny I didn't even know if I ate it or not.   For our entree we ordered  a bowl of mussels, seared sea scallop, whole fish, and steak.  OMG everything was SO SO SO BAD!!!  The fish was wayyyy overcooked that it was mushy and gross. The steak was cooked badly and the scallops were over cooked too. I don't know how you can open a \"seafood\" restaurant when you don't even know how to cook fish.   We were so unsatisfied and upset that we were really ready to leave half way through our meal. However we did not see our waitress not one time since our food came out so we couldn't even ask for our check. 30 minutes later still no server. My husband was so upset he went up to the hostess and asked if she could get our server so we can get our check. she replied \" that's not my job\"  umm...excuse me???  wow. we were just in shock at her rude attitude. Still can't believe as I write this review.   To be completely honest, we stopped by Burger king on our way home and my husband and father in law each ordered a meal because the food at rock salt was so bad and they were still hungry after the meal.   This restaurant needs so much improvement I don't even know where to start but we will definitely not be going back.",

I informed the waitress who was quite rude about it and went to grab someone else who I'm assuming was the manager, she didn't even introduce herself, who also looked at the oyster to find the worm. The platter of oysters was then taken from me and about 10 minutes later they brought me fresh oysters and that was it. No apology and I was still charged for all of the oysters.

    "text": "Thanks to Restaurant Week, I finally tried Rock Salt, which has been on my bucket list for ages.   Rock Salt is known for their oyster bar and wood-fired grill. They do $1.00 oysters M-F from 3-7 pm (I'm going to have to stop in for that!) and they do brunch on the weekends. The inside is very quaint and cosy, with wooden beams and an open grill, meaning the diners can see the chefs preparing the food. I like that and feel like it makes the dining experience more personable. They also have a great patio, though it was too hot for us to sit outside!  I'm a seafood girl, so their focus is sustainable seafood is right up my alley. They get their seafood from the Carolina and Virginia coasts AND they do craft cocktails, aka my favorite. They don't serve anything fried, thanks to their wood-fired grill. And they don't have a microwave - so their food is always fresh.  The Restaurant Week menu is typically much smaller than the normal menu. They had three choices for appetizers, four choices for the main course, and three choices for dessert. All of these items are on their usual menu, though, which is a huge plus.  For my appetizer, I chose the BBQ oysters that came with a smokey fresno BBQ butter. They were served warm, over a bed of sea salt and were delicious. I give these guys an 8 for taste and creativity. I would definitely order them again.  My compadres' ordered one of each of the other choices, so I also got to try some oyster chowder with bacon, leeks and potatoes, and a grilled romaine salad with charred corn and tomatoes (spiced pecans on the side, because they love me). The chowder was just ok - I'm more of a clam chowder girl. The grilled romaine salad was unbelievable - served with a greek goddess dressing - likely a mixture based on yogurt and avocado, and the flavors all came together really well. I need to grill out and recreate this.  For my main meal, I went with the NC Amberjack simple fish, served over arugula. I got the lemon aioli and wakame salsa verde on the side. I had never tried Amberjack fish before to my knowledge, so I knew I had to go for it. It is a white fish with a milder taste. It actually looks a little like swordfish but it is even thicker and juicier. I liked it! I was a little disappointed the fish didn't come with a carbohydrate or starch - the plate looked pretty bare.   I wasn't overly impressed with the dessert options. One option was a chocolate coffee mousse with grilled pineapple. Another was a goat cheese panna cotta with granola. I asked if the granola had nuts and the waitress said she was \"pretty sure.\" Better safe than sorry so I stayed away from that one. The last choice was a selection of gelatos or sorbets. I went with vanilla, strawberry and a mango sorbet, though I wish they had some crazier flavors available.  The gelato was delicious! The strawberry was actually my favorite, and I didn't even finish the mango sorbet. It was good and refreshing, but doesn't compare to gelato, and couldn't follow up the creaminess and sweetness of the vanilla and strawberry.  All in all, a good dining experience (3.5). I'm curious to return and order some staples off of their normal dinner menu, such as the ceviche, smashed avocado, sea scallops and more oysters.",

    "text": "Best oyster happy hour! I'm all about the oysters here. Love that you get 3 options of oysters for their happy hour. I am from a beach town and grew up eating raw oysters and at Rocksalt they are always super fresh and delicious. I could easily just eat oysters every time I come here but I have tried a few other things including their octopus appetizer, chowder, grilled oysters and burger which were all top notch. The menu changes seasonally so it's hard to have favorites among the other menu items. The bar area is the best seat, you have a front row view of the oysters and shucking! From the bar I usually go for a dirty martini which I like with the briny old salt oysters or their sparkling rose which they have by the glass and pairs well with the buttery Rappahannock oysters.",

My family grows oysters in Deltaville, VA, which is about a mile from where the Rappahonicks they sell are grown and they're some of the best oysters I've ever had. They have $1 oysters until 7PM, but they are smaller than their typical oysters, but still delicious. All of their small plates are fantastic also. We have the low country boil and it was amazing. If you want a full meal, you won't be filled up here but for a nice app or two, this place has you covered. The Rock Salts are also fantastic if you want an oyster with a bit more salinity. For seafood in Charlotte, this is the best place.",

Oysters, drinks, beet salad...how hard can that be with two people at a table, and not more than 3-4 tables at noon on a Sunday?  The restaurant is designed in such a way that anyone in the kitchen or bar area can see every table in the place... so why did we have to get up and walk to the bar and get our server every time we wanted a drink, or another appetizer?  Because he was intent on polishing glasses and sitting at a front table with his co-workers or friends, that's why.  Maybe the service is why this place is practically empty on Sunday afternoon with oysters on special and other great food and drink items with a nice atmosphere and a decent patio.",

    "text": "I went for Restaurant Week and was unfortunately disappointed. My reservations were 6:15 on a Sat. night, before the real rush starts, yet the service was slow and not responsive. The restaurant menu was limited with most of the more attractive options at various up-charges. This may have been advertised ahead of time, if so, that's on me. Regardless, that is something of a pet peeve that most restaurants are now doing. I would prefer a $40-$45 prix fix charge than the bait and switch, but I digress...   My grilled oysters appetizer was actually very, very good. But then my main course, a grilled whole rose fish was pretty flavorless. If you are going to grill a whole fish, ideally it is going to be a big, meaty fish. Otherwise you spend most of your time picking bones out of your mouth, which I did between flavorless bites. My wife's scallops were very good, though portion sizes were very small. They were out of the bottle of wine we wanted - again, 6:15 pm reservations - and the side of cornbread our friends ordered didn't come until after we had already completed our main courses. To cap it off, they couldn't split the bill correctly but rather than correct it I just exchanged a few bucks with our friends so we could go someplace else for a drink.   In short, outside of a few, limited highlights the service was not great, where the food was good, the portions left a lot to be desired and we really couldn't get out of there fast enough. There are a lot of great seafood options in Charlotte, this is not one of them.",

The trout was especially good with the skin perfectly crispy, but the sides and portion of them left something to be desired. Definitely one of those twice the price for half the food kind of places. My boyfriend couldn't stop smirking at his dessert (called simply \"Chocolate\" on the menu) of 3 ping pong ball sized truffles placed \"artfully\" on one side of a full sized dinner plate... 75% of the plate was empty!   Nice and attentive service, but food was very slow to come out. Also, acoustics are terrible and had to practically yell to hear each other across the table.   On taste alone I'd give 5 stars, but my rating reflects the value in my opinion. Admittedly I have not tried the oysters which is their specialty or cocktails.",

    "text": "Om-gosh you guys the staff here is amazing! However it was restaurant week so im going to try to go light on this establishment. First off our waitress Hailey was the best , very informative and descriptive on the food and drinks at Rock Salt , as well as attentive. So as you know for restaurant week/weekend you get 3 courses for $35 at any considered upscale restaurant at this price. I had my mouth set on the trout after seeing so many raving reviews on this dish. We had been waiting for quite some time for our first,second,and third course to come out and that why i mentioned im going to go light because its restaurant week so you kind of sort of give places some kind of benefit of the doubt due the rush of this special occasion (restaurant week). From the menu what was included in the special is you can order from the snack and share , the main, and dessert. I ordered the steamed shrimp, originally trout , and chocolate root beer cake. The manager Ben came out and informed me that he was very sorry but after waiting they just realized they are out of trout so i had to settle for the rose fish. I was not a fan of the rose fish at all, first of all it was burnt , and i didn't care for the taste of it there was little to no flavor. Ben was very aware that i wasn't happy with the fish and  did everything in his power to make me happy. Steamed shrimp was definitely a winner, and may i add the presentation for the dishes here are very nice. I was a little  overly excited about wiping my hands on the lemon scented towelettes wipes after eating my shrimp, nice touch. The drinks  were ok, I had the paloma, and also i did forget to mention my boyfriend choices was the grilled octopus(yummy), the daily catch which was catfish he wasn't crazy about he just ate it because he was hungry as mentioned due to us trying to wait all day to eat to have room for our night out last night, and for dessert the lemon panna cotta. I really want to like this place i like the uniqueness of it and get the concept they will definitely  survive because of the location of the restaurant, we were confined to a condensed menu im sure due to restaurant week, so maybe we need to re visit here again another day.",

Until the end of 2015 their raw oysters are $1.00 each; therefore, a dozen Old Salts were shucked and whisked to our table.  OMG, yeah they are that good.  Love, love, love 'em!  I ordered the cobia salad with anchovy salsa verde dressing and it was perfect.  My wife requested the market salad and, while it was good, she thought the veggies muddled the flavor--not a do-over for her.  She kept picking at my cobia, however.  My only pullback on my review is the price.  While I think they should charge a fair price, the portions didn't match my expectations.  Two glasses of wine each, two somewhat small salads, and a dozen oysters we shucked out a c-note including tip for lunch.  Our server, BTW, was great (thanks, Kala V)!  All that being said, we'll be back.  Thanks for a great lunch!",

We spotted RockSalt sometime back and decided to try it last night.  The short review: everything was FABULOUS!  Our drive is 5.5 hours so we skip lunch. It was an early dinner. We started with a dozen oysters on the half shell, chilled avocado soup with sesame crab meat and bo yaw slaw (it's fabulous!). We ordered a second round of oysters, crab cake and veggies- butter beans, squash and okra which were cooked perfectly.  Now my wife is a Master Chef of Southern cuisine with 40 years experience. This morning she said she laid awake last night appreciating how the meal was expertly prepared. My friends...that's a high compliment.  I know from the taste. The chef at ROCKSALT is indeed a Master. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening on your patio. We'll be back - with friends!  Byron & Melanie",

I also like how the sectioned off the outside so nobody can walk through when you eat.  Logistically this place is set up very nice.  Very soft lighting and a great ambience .   It was dollar oyster time which was awesome..  This is half the reason I came back.  The oysters were definitely on point.  The house made sauces were so good that even I was using the cocktail sauce which is a rarity for me.  The house made hotsauce, the horseradish, and some other sauce were bomb.I think they use it on their ceviche, but I am not certain.  The menu is small and perfect. The beer and wine menu is also perfect.  The only thing I have a problem with is the price. $27 for a dozen oysters is a bit pricey and $12 for a bowl of soup is pricey.  I love the feel and vibe of this place, but unfortunately the location does not warrant these prices.  I understand the vibe you are going for and your pricing reflects that.  Come down just a tad and I would be back more often than not. Unfortunately I have other options in the area.",

Unfortunately this was not the case. Upon walking in the first interaction with the hostess was pretty poor. Speaking from experience, the hostess is the face of a restaurant and the first impression. If that stands True, the first impression was an attitude and rude. Next, we all sat down including a very hungry 16 month old. As soon as we could get our server we ordered several small plates, including a salad, tuna tartare, and a pimento cheese dip. Over an hour later the salad was brought out. I can't believe we had enough patience to stay that long. My son was beside himself so hungry and as we had only received two plates we were ready to leave. Then as we asked for our check a third plate appeared. I must give credit to our server who was kind and appeared to be trying. Also one of our plates was comped because we were so disappointed. The service was awful and food was not nearly worth the wait. Needless to say we will not be back!",

The shrimp and grits had a new twist as the chef used a lamb gravy base.  It was outstanding.  We ordered five different entrees for our table of four and shared all around.  This is absolutely the best way to experience this place.    It is a very social atmosphere.  We read of some complaining of the noise, but that was all part of the lively vibe of this place. The chef came out and talked to our table for awhile.  We also found ourselves interacting with the tables around us as everyone was interested in trying something new.  It truly made the meal a social experience.   I am sure they will continue to tweak all parts of the restaurant, but overall we enjoyed every aspect.    Is this the type of place where you go for a quiet intimate night out, probably not.  Is it somewhere you go for incredible food and a wonderful dining experience, definitely.  We will be back!  Especially when it is warm enough to open up the patio area.",

The restaurant is small but decorated nicely and they have very nice patio. Tight squeezes for the waitresses.  Water was spilled on me during my first visit and on my friend my second trip.  I had raw oysters here and they were a reasonable size and very tasty. I also order entrees and appetizers on my two visits. There scallop appetizer was not my favorite and I love scallops. During my dinner visit I tried the Louisiana BBQ shrimp which was a special for the night and that was really good. I had steak for my entree and I can definitely say that I had better. It was over cooked. Funny enough I tried to make it work still because I was hungry. I  asked for steak sauce to make it a little more tasty and was told they do not carry steak sauce at all. Which might be a good business plan if you have really awesome steaks but the steak wasn't awesome. I tasted what my dinner mates had on both trips and the food just wasn't that impressive. I would definitely drive here for oysters especially when they're on special vs going to Lure for shorter drive-but not for much else.",

The drinks were alright, I am a fan of their take on a dark and stormy. The pimento dip could have been good if it wasn't for the rock hard crostinis, we had to stop after the first bite to make sure we wouldn't need to go to the emergency dental clinic across the street. The roasted oysters--tried the bourbon  bacon--were terrible. The topping on top was mushy and made the texture disgusting. We also tried the ceviche, it seemed like it had been curing for days. The fish was overcured which is weird in a ceviche, but maybe it had just been sitting for a long time due to the lack of customers. Our waitress was apathetic at best, no real concern that we didn't eat more than 10 percent of our food, just took it all away and brought our check. But the no eye contact from any of the staff on our way out made it clear that they knew we weren't fans of this place. $90 for 3 terrible \"small plates\" and hit or miss drinks, makes me wish the Indian restaurant  that used to inhabit this spot was still there.",

My boyfriend ordered one of the special dishes where it came as a whole fish (tail, head and all) also featuring the smallest oysters and clams in the world on the side. There was salsa herb type of sauce poured over the fish. It tasted ok not over the top. I ordered a scallop dish. Came with a mix of corn, okra, other earthy veggies, and four small scallops on top. You could find bigger scallops at a chinese buffet. The entire dish was cooked with butter that probably had some herbs in it that made it green...butter was the taste though. Unfortunately for us, we sat outside since there wasn't much seating left inside. The bugs and flies were no joke at all. The staff couldn't keep the candles and tiki torches lit so the flies surrounded us. They wouldn't leave a lighter with us to relight the candles. I was able to finish my small \"big plate\" in ten bites. My boyfriend didn't get to finish his because the small gnats and flies got too much. They got into the fish head and crawled in and out of the mouth and gills. Wait staff was above average. Food left a lot be desired. Not sure what we were paying for with a bill over $130 after tip.

New management, new servers, and a new menu make it obviously very difficult to create the dining experience that the owner ultimately intends. However, my experience at RockSalt tonight was abhorrent. Not just because the cold raw bar items we ordered were subpar, but because when we offered our opinion on possible improvements, they were met with incredulity and just flat out rudeness. I never asked for any kind of reimbursement on the check, not did I expect it, but paying over $150 for a meal that I could have ordered at Georges (which is ALWAYS a great choice), Beef and Bottle, or, let's be honest, Red Lobster, is insane.   I give this place two stars because the server did the best that she could with the unbelievably large section she was assigned. But I will give zero stars to the management as well as food quality to this restaurant. Don't waste your time. At this point, it will be a good restaurant within a year under new management.",

The building interior and outside patio are really well done and have an edgy, hip feeling.  The cool vibe stops there.  Upon arrival, from the hostess to our server to the food runners you get the feeling that they can't be bothered.  The server acted annoyed when my husband asked him to repeat the draft beer selections, he didn't explain them or offer a sample.  Specials were not shared with us until we asked. Service is cold, unwelcoming, and borders on downright rude. My husband and daughter ordered a dozen raw oysters and they were the only thing we would return for.  I had one of  the whole fish specials (sheepshead) which was delicious and prepared well.  The Brutus salad was not anything my husband expected.  The menu says anchovy dressing, so he expected a Ceasar type dressing, not whole anchovies dumped all over the salad.  He likes anchovies, so he ate it.  We ordered 2 of the Hoi Toider for the 3 of us and were really disappointed.  The fish/cheese spread is  not smoky flavored at all - as advertised- and the house made crackers it comes with were mostly stale.   How can a place not get crackers correct?? My daughter ordered the lambs and  clams.  The steamed clams were good, although no dish was given for the empty shells so she had to put them on the table.   The lamb sausage in the dish is actually ground up bits in the sauce so the $13 price tag for this small plate is a bit steep.   We did not get dessert and found the offerings lackluster.  With the prices they charge here we were surprised the first dessert on the menu comes with sour gummy worms.  Seems more appropriate for Chuck E Cheese.   Not sure what they are going for with Rock Salt, but they need to figure it out.  Save yourself the time and money and eat elsewhere.  Too bad, it could be a really cool place.",

The outside patio is large and even though overlooks a parking lot with cars passing by it was still nice to sit outside. We ordered the cheese plate a bit pricey for what we got but not to bad. We ordered 4 cocktail shrimp at $2 a piece but they were 14-18 count shrimp and the sauce that came with them was incredible.  We also ordered oysters Rockefeller with was also awesome. Those price points were average on what we ordered but the main courses are very expensive for the atmosphere and service we received.  Again,  the apps we had were very good but if we would have ordered entrees as well even if they were incredible I would have been disappointed in the overall experience.   I know people say you pay for quality of food but for us the food and the experience is what makes us come back time and time again and unfortunately we won't be back as it doesnt have both for us.",

    "text": "I had such a wonderful dining experience here on Saturday evening!  I read so many reviews about the noise level, and that was not our experience at all. We dined inside, and from start to finish, the meal and service was superb!  I started my meal with the, \"Little Sister\" cocktail which was light, refreshing, and delicious!  For appetizers, we had jumbo, chilled, North Carolina shrimp, and the scallop dish with corn puree, bacon, and smoked ricotta. The shrimp was exceptional, among the freshest I have had. The scallops...I would have licked the plate clean if I could have. Absolutely phenomenal!!  I can't say enough about the freshness and quality of the seafood, the scallops tasted like they were just pulled from the water. And those oysters!!!!!  Wow!  I have dined at some of the finest seafood restaurants in NYC, eaten freshly shucked oysters right out of the waters in cape cod, and these oysters were the best I have ever had.  I chose the olde salt oysters, raw.  Absolutely phenomenal. The white wine mignonette was the perfect compliment to these briny gems!  For dinner I had the wood grilled, catch of the day, Snapper. It was PERFECTLY cooked. Wood fired, crispy fish skin, delicate, flaky meat.  My boyfriend had the crab cake, which was, again, one of the best we've ever had. This cake is all crab!  (For those complaining about the price and serving size, $13 for a large, crab packed cake is something I would happily pay for again). The sides were equally delicious and fun, grits were cheesy and delicious, and the corn with Alabama white sauce was something I could eat an entire bowl of.  For dessert, we had the half baked cheesecake, which was delicious, with that sour apple butter, it just left me wanting some texture. (That is the only \"criticism\" I have)      Our server, Allison was phenomenal!!!!  We cannot say enough about her.  Prompt, lovely, knowledgable, and happy to answer any question. (If her manager reads this, she is so, so, wonderful and this was by far, the best dining experience I have had since moving to Charlotte)  I cannot wait to come back during happy hour to try all of their oysters!  Huge kudos to the chefs, you guys are doing an amazing job!        To those who have had negative experiences, I encourage you to try RockSalt out again, I imagine they were going through some growing pains. Thank you to the chef and staff of RockSalt for such a delicious, wonderful experience!  We cannot wait to come back and will be requesting Allison!",

    "text": "Not really impressed with our experience at Rock Salt last night, my small group had a reservation for my friends birthday at 730pm, I believe we all sat at about 745 PM.  The host had come to the table at some point, pouring water in the begining so we started to ask her questions, but she said the server would be there soon.  She pointed out the chalkboard that had the beer on tap and different catches of the day,  which we all had questions about.  They didnt seem really busy, and there were alot of staff around, but took a long time for everything.   Finally the server came over, she took our order for drinks, and a few of us ordered some apps, Which we tried the cornbread and smoked trout, not impressed at all and they took a very long time.  My one friend order shrimp and asked for it to be grilled which the server said she couldnt do, but when dinner came out the guy next to her had a chardgilled piece of bread, basically burnt, so little confused.   It was nearly 9pm before we even started to order our dinner.  Our server was nice but very quite and unpersonable.  Finally dinner came out, my boyfriend ordered a burger, figure you cant go wrong, and for $20, it better be good.....it was not.  I ordered the fresh catch which was the wreck fish with a brocolli side dish, when the fish came out, I thought where is the rest of it, surely for $30 there is more to this fish, but nope.  It was alright but not worth it.  I will definitely not go back and if anyone asks me I will them not to waste their time.  Way too over priced for the service and the food.",

For our entrees, I had the scallops and my fiance had the grilled octopus. Again, it was incredibly fresh and delicious. During our meal, the manager congratulated me on my promotion at work, which I found out my fiance told them when he placed the reservations.

We went in for the happy hour oysters, which have always been a huge hit with me, but we ended ordering dinner knowing there was a new chef onboard.  So. Good. I ordered the fish OTD, swordfish, and it was absolutely incredible. The fish was cooked perfectly and tasted fantastic. My friend ordered the scallop dish and couldn't believe the difference between that and the last time we ordered scallops here. We also split the cornbread skillet which I cannot speak highly enough of.   This was truly a fantastic experience--so happy to update my review to reflect the changes within this establishment!

I love that ROCKSALT has $1 oysters every single day -- 3pm-7pm Monday-Friday and 11:30am-4pm Saturday and Sunday. Make sure to ask for freshly grated horseradish and their homemade hot sauce. Seriously, that hot sauce is so ridiculously delicious. They should bottle it and sell.   My latest trip here I discovered they also do half price bottles of wine on Thursdays. I cannot wait for warm weather so I can sit on their fabulous patio on Thursdays, drinking bubbly and crushing oysters. I'm fancy like that. Fancy AF.   I've had several things from the menu. Toad in the Hole, Tuna Tartar, the tartine, clams, ceviche, everything has been great. The new bone marrow is just stupid good. The pickled raisins on it are so delicious and such a surprise. I really like the charred spring onions as well. The sauce and cheese combo is just lovely.   What really makes this place great is the GM, Jessica. She really goes above and beyond here. It makes dining an experience and not just a meal. I can't say enough good things.  ROCKSALT is so lucky to have her.",

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate quality food and don't mind paying for it - but sadly this just isn't one of those places. I'd rather pay more for less at some of the great restaurants closer to Myers Park/Uptown. We left this place and needed to grab a post-dinner snack and that didn't feel right after paying $125 for two for dinner. I hope they sustain a clientele, because Park Rd area needs more restaurants, but sadly we must not be the target audience for this place ....",

    "text": "Unfortunately this place deserves a big \"wah wahhhhh.\" Absolutely the worst oyster experience I've ever had.  Came here on a Friday after seeing a sign in front with $1 oyster happy hour. After being seated at 6:20, we were still waiting for oysters at 7:25. It was not that busy by my take.   The decor is well done and the patio is very inviting (also a reason for deciding to come in, since it was such a nice evening). We ordered beers and were given the cans, without being asked if we wanted glasses. We asked and were brought out warm pint glasses. Based on the type of restaurant, we should have been asked about glasses.   Our waitress did not acknowledge us for 15 minutes upon arrival. When I finally said \"hi\", I got a curt smile and she walked off, returning a few minutes later to take our order. I said thank you several times over the hour plus we were there, and never was thanked in return. We were asked if we wanted crackers, but never received them.   On top of the slow and less than superior service, several of the oyster shells were butchered (see attached pic). We were spitting out shell pieces for quite some time afterwards.   It's a shame that such a nice looking restaurant was so underwhelming.",

They always have 3 different oysters to choose from, and they are fresh shucked practically in front of you (especially if you sit at the bar). They also have fresh shredded horseradish, which is an amazing accompaniment. You can't go wrong with an assortment of each oyster, but the olde salts might be my favorite; fresh and briny.   Also, the daytime bartender on Saturday is wonderful! I always mean to grab her name, but I forget. She's just extremely considerate and friendly!",

    "text": "Well, I was hoping that on the 2nd visit, things would be better.  Should have known something was wrong when it was restaurant week and there were only four cars in the parking lot.    Service was fine this time, but the Queen's Feast menu was very lackluster and we left hungry and ended up going to another bar and ordering more food.  Unlike many other restaurants, there was NOTHING that came with the entree, so all you got was an appetizer (salad, chowder or oysters).  But when the fish came out, that was it, no side, no garnish, NADA.  Looked very plain on the plate and the serving was small when considering nothing else came with it.  Unfortunately, you also could not order off the main menu during restaurant week, so the choices were limited to the three course meal and some \"add-on's\", which consisted of a fish cake, clams, etc., but still no sides like potatoes, vegis, etc.  Very disappointed on my second visit.  Pretty sure this will have been my last visit.  This is really too bad too, as the restaurant is in a great location and very appealing on the inside, not to mention the great patio for use when the weather is more pleasant.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to ROCKSALT for lunch last Saturday. It was pretty good, and we'll give it another go for dinner, but won't likely go back for lunch. I'm no foodie, but I've worked in enough restaurants from Chili's to brew pubs, to steakhouses, and I feel confident in saying, ROCKSALT has an identity crisis brewing. The lunch menu is really poorly constructed, IMHO. The restaurant screams raw bar, and they do have a few raw bar dishes (the oysters were excellent), but the rest of the menu was confusing in that it is all over the place. Pork belly banh mi. So is it Asian influenced? Pasta primavera. So is it Italian? Hamburger. An American eatery?   The one thing that would have made perfect sense--seafood and pasta in a white wine sauce--was nowhere to be found. The scattered menu didn't leave me saying, \"oh! so many options, I want to try them all!\" Instead, it left me saying, \"I don't understand this menu, so I don't really know what their signature dishes are, so I actually don't really want any of this.\" I got the banh mi, and my wife got a small platter of clams and lamb (both dishes were good). However, combine the odd menu with reaaaally slow service (5+ minutes to be greeted by our server, despite being two of ten people in the restaurant) means that we are in no hurry to go back (certainly not for lunch).   We took a dinner menu to go, and we'll give it a try at some point. I hope their dinner crowd is booming, because I don't know that their lunch menu is going to have much draw.",

Nice bar with oyster shucking in full sight. And no TVs. You can actually have a conversation here!  And my conversation tonight was with Tobias, the executive chef. Learning about their oysters and the Croxton family in Virginia that owns this place and the oyster farm from which all of their oysters come.   Bottom line is this is the only place you should get oysters in Charlotte. It's basically farm to table oysters. That means fresh. Sustainable. High quality. I really liked the Olde Salts. Juicy, plump and briny.   Good selection of local beers. And lots of other stuff on the menu that looked and smelled good.   But with all those oysters who really cares about the rest of the menu?",

It took about 20 minutes for the shots to come out and another 10 minutes for the drinks. When asked if they had Miller lite beer, the server said yes. She then brought out Miller high life. I was told I couldn't get my steak medium so I ordered something else instead. The portions were incredibly small! We had to rush out after being there for almost 3 hours to get to our evening plans. One of the meals also had a piece of plastic in it which a new meal was given. They weren't going to take off the meal until something was said. The server didn't even know that something was found in the food because it was told to another server as ours never asked how our food was. During our 3 course meal she would ask if we needed anything else when food came out but disappeared until we finished the course. In terms of pricing, it was great that they participated in restaurant week. But why bother when they are going to upcharge almost every item in both appetizers and meals. We also brought in an ice cream cake to celebrate a birthday. I asked for it to be put in the freezer and was told it would be done. They did not do that for us. For the amount our bill was it was quite the disappointing experience. Go elsewhere.",

Service has always been friendly and prompt without being overly attentive, even when we show up with a baby.  The oyster happy hour is a phenomenal deal.  For comparison, Whole Foods will sell you oysters for $1.29 a piece and then you have to schuck them yourself, so $1/piece is well worth it.  Although to be fair, it ends up being a wash because you'll go for the happy hour and be too enticed by the rest of the menu to just stick with oysters.  Love the burrata and tuna tartare.  Wasn't particularly impressed with the ceviche but everything else I've tried from the small plates has been delicious.  Go for small plates over the whole fish.  Whole fish is good, not great.  Small plates is really where they shine.",

    "text": "I understand this is relatively a new place, and I hope they will improve, but my 1st visit last Tuesday night left much to be desired from both the food & service standpoint.  The place has a cool vibe, and I'm certain that in itself will create some sort of a following. It has a sleek yet rustic feel. And the fact that I cannot even remember what this building used to be, and somehow they were able to transformed the space into what it is speaks for itself.   Please keep in mind that the main door is the tiny one on the side away from the parking area. The patio looked good, but too bad Charlotte decided to be the Northeast and sitting in freezing temp wasn't an option.  Our server, while diligent and efficient, came across as a little elementary throughout the evening. Don't get me wrong - I am not the \"snotty\" kind, but then if I'm paying $25+ for an entree, I expected a certain level of food/drink/serving knowledge, such as the fact that a regular mixed liquor drink (ex. something ginger/tonic/coke etc) is to be \"on the rocks.\" Or if the plate is a shell plate, she should have separated the bowl from the plate (sans paper napkin) when she delivered the clam bowl to the table - instead she walked by and semi-barked at us with \"you know the plate is for the shells.\" Well there, not my first day eating clams but thank you for the tips! Or the fact that they didn't offer any bread for any of the saucy dishes (clams bowl and mussels bowl) - and instead of acknowledging that was an oversight, she proceeded to explain the purpose of rice noodles was to soak up the sauce. My people invented rice noodles!  And oh, they ran out of oysters. Yes, a raw bar did not have oysters - none for the raw platter, none for baked appetizer. The reason was that the cold weather interrupted VA oyster production. Well - what happened to the Gulf coast? Shouldn't a raw bar carry multiple sources of oysters at all time regardless?   The food itself was ok. I had the oyster stew ($7), and it tasted good yet with little oyster taste (or actual oyster - I fished 2 tiny baby ones in my cup). My friend had the Lambs & Clams ($13): small portion with tasty broth yet nothing to soak up the broth with. The lamb sausage was a little overcooked. My entree was the sea scallops ($28); there were 4 giant ones and they were great. However I didn't quite understand the side items - the \"crushed potatoes\" were oven baked fingerling potatoes, and a giant pile of greens (aka slaw), both were just thrown on the plate and didn't exactly compliment the scallops or the sauce. My friend ordered the mussels bowl ($21) - and the coconut curry sauce had a good kick to it. There were a few undercooked mussels - and to be fair we did not know for sure if they were the culprit of our subsequent irritated stomach (fyi, that's to put it mildly - as I was literally cold-sweating during my drive home, and for the record I don't get sick from food easily).  I suppose the last straw was the call I made to the restaurant 2 days later to inform them of my upset stomach. I didn't have any expectation besides to inform them in case there was a bad batch of food (and to be fair before I write a review). I was holding for the manager on duty who answered the phone with just a \"hello\" (what happened to \"Hi, this is MY NAME, how may I help you?\" for business calls) After I informed her what took place, first came the awkward silence, then she tried to dismiss it (ex. \"It normally takes longer to get sick than that, maybe it's something you ate before dinner?\"). I was hoping she would ask what I ate as a way of showing the restaurant cares about such incidents (I did volunteer the info). In short, pretend you care. To give her credit, she did at the end offer her sympathy and a gift certificate (granted she didn't ask for my info per se - and that wasn't my reason of calling).   After all said and done, I am not in a hurry to revisit. In the meantime I hope they will make some changes to their operations (ex. get more sources of oysters - better training for servers and managers - get some bread - don't get people sick).",

My wife was the one that actually suggested Rocksalt, and I'm glad she did. Our night started out well with a very short wait before we were seated. We were then blessed with a wonderful waitress, Marissa, who kindly repeated the catch of the day to my wife three times. My wife ended up ordering the catch and it was presented fantastically. I, myself, ordered the steak, which was fantastic and extremely tender. The service was great, the food was great, and the atmosphere was pleasant; all of which made for a fantastic night.",

Starters were served after the seafood had already arrived.  Oysters and mussels were tiny.  Asked for tobasco and were given a small container with enough to cover about two oysters. We've definitely had better elsewhere in Charlotte for much more reasonable prices. Not to mention we have never been to a restaurant where we had to hit up Five Guys afterward. Can't recommend this place. Save your money.",

The Bay Scallop Ceviche was great too before dinner came out.   I had the Brandywine Boil - the broth was tasty and was great to dip the perfectly toasted slide of bread into. The clams, muscles, and Shrimp were good but they had a really good version of sausage as opposed to the red Italian sausage you normally get in a boil that was a nice change.   The Scallops we had as the other main entree were nice and big.   Would certainly go back.",

The service was really good here but the food was just okay as I expected it to blow me away from the way other people talked about it.   The oysters were relatively smaller than expected but were tasty. I wanted a different type of vinegar side to go with the oysters similar to Watermans vinegar base potion. Whatever side vinegar they gave lacked flavor.   I wish I would have actually tried more food here as I am sure it is good but I am not in a rush to come back to Rocksalt. If you haven't given Watermans a try please go there to compare. I think you will come to the same conclusion as me.  Nevertheless, I would give this place another try but just not any time soon.",

Off to a good start.  Ordering from the prix fixe menu, we each chose oysters though my wife's were grilled and mine were raw. First mistake - my wife liked mine more and she's now an oyster addict. They were that good. Only three but with the cocktail sauce and chimmichurri sauce, very nicely presented.  Main course, we each chose the daily catch. Trout for my wife and swordfish for me. A nice portion served on a base of cauliflower mash that was very delicious and keto-friendly for both of us. Both pieces of fish were cooked perfectly, plated nicely and very tasty. Really enjoyed.  For third course, my wife's bread pudding was quite sweet and she enjoyed. I chose the cheese plate and skipped the delicious looking cracker. Three big pieces of cheese were a perfect finish to our meal.  Excellent service and I have no problem with a five star review of ROCKSALT. We will be back.  [Review 10375 overall, 141 of 2019.]",

The restaurant is intimate, yet inviting.  You have numerous options and we sat at one of the hightop near the front.  This gave us a primetime view of the kitchen which was nice.  Our service was really good as they provided insight on the menu as well as good back and forth banter.    The food was done very well.  We tried a number of dishes and for the most part enjoyed all of them.  Started  off with Oysters (can you go wrong). Our waiter told us the differences and about their oyster beds that they own up north.  We also had the soup (Shrimp and scallop chowder) which was awesome.  Good amount of seafood and a good thick base.  For our mains, we got the Snapper whole fish.  I was a little picky and they deboned it for me. which was a nice touch.    All in all it was an enjoyable meal and great dining experience",

The dining area and patio are very inviting and sitting at the raw bar is definitely preferred.  Most recently I have stuck with the oysters and they are still the highlight of ROCKSALT. I have tried a few menu items but think I'm just going to stick to the oysters as they still aren't that great.  I also was disappointed to see they have removed the option of shrimp like they do oysters. You used to be able to order 1, 4, or 10, however now the only shrimp available is the peel & eat, which I did not enjoy.  Overall, happy to see service has improved, and if you plan to visit definitely check out their oysters!",

We were there right after 5 pm on a Wednesday night so seating was not a problem.  It filled up quickly, though.  They had a board with the  fresh fish options on it.  Several were filleted and several came with heads still attached to their little bodies.  There are people who like to look into the eyes of a fish they are about to eat. I am not one of those.  So, we ordered the Rudder Fish with a creamed cauliflower and special pistachio topping.  It was well prepared, well presented, and well EATEN.  There were a lot of people around us enjoying oysters.  This is a trendy spot in posh Park Road shopping center.  So, our much younger waiter, Thomas, totally played to to my 84 year old mom and earned a ton of brownie points. I loved that he gave so much of himself.  We formed a connection beyond what kind of fish we wanted.   I don't see much they could improve upon other than offering a greater variety of sweeteners and maybe getting some seating with some cushioning.  Those little wooden chairs are hard on boney butts,  like mine!  The desserts sounded fabulous, especially the s'mores and the caramel bread pudding.  So glad this restaurant is in Charlotte.   Go check it out!",

The oysters (both raw and grilled) were delicious - we will definitely be back sometime for oysters! However we both got the daily catch (swordfish) and were let down. The portion size was very small. While we weren't expecting anything huge on the restaurant week menu, our piece of fish was so small and thin it was overcooked. I wish we would have sprung for the whole fish entree and paid the extra $10! Dessert was good, but was only a very small taste (at least of my coconut cake). I am interested to see how the regular menu items compare to restaurant week. I will definitely try Rocksalt again for their oysters.",

Actually, everything we ate there was phenomenal!  Also I wish I could remember the name of our server, but he gave us the best service I've had in a while! He made great wine and food recommendations and was very friendly and attentive, despite the fact that he was the only server there at the time and had several tables. He made sure we were happy and had everything we needed throughout our entire meal.  Between the oyster special, phenomenal food and drinks, and impeccable service, I would eat here every day if I could lol. I can't recommend this place highly enough!",

I think it's safe to assume that the hostess didn't ask for a name because we were the only people with a reservation at that time. While we weren't expecting a surprise birthday bash (LOL), I figured she'd see the note from Open Table and wish him a happy birthday....she did not.  The waitress was very very nice and accommodating. Having great knowledge of the menu was helpful to us being that neither of us had been there before.   We ordered from the happy hour selection of $1 oysters, and a few other menu items as well. Everything was good!   This was my first time having oysters and I'm grateful to have had them here. I am officially a fan :-) My favorite menu item is the grilled oysters...AMAZEballs!!!  Again, there were maybe two tables outside, and we were the only party dining inside. The manager stayed tucked away in the corner at the bar and NEVER came to ask how we were doing or anything. That almost always happens at other restaurants, even when they are busy.   Even though they did not acknowledge his birthday, we ate good and had a ball and will definitely be back!",

The non seafood dishes looked good as they went by but for my first time here I stuck to things from the sea. The tuna tartare appetizer was good but the trip of oysters was exceptional with delicious sauces to try on each kind. I went with the shrimp and grits with pork belly. . Everything was slow but I think with the all-star weekend crowds it's not surprising. We we're with great friends so we we're in no rush. Our server knew things were slow so did a good job checking up on us and made up for it with a nice dessert treat at the end. Well handled.",

We started off with a dozen oysters, and the grilled octopus was cooked beautifully. What was frustrating is it took 40 minutes to get our 1st round of drinks and these didn't come until after our appetizers. how can you shuck 12 oysters and grill an octopus quicker than pouring some wine?  Our server seemed overwhelmed all night, and the staff did a poor job with any support. Our entrees were also on point as half the table ordered the Scallops entree and the other got the Crab Cake  Not the best we've ever had, but a solid meal.  So props to the chefs, but with so many great options in Charlotte I'd say check out somewhere else for a better overall experience, especially at this price point",

I had grilled oysters topped with lemon herb butter, it was good. Should of got two orders! When we went, they were only sitting on the patio (Saturday evening), but that was fine it was pretty nice outside and made for good pictures. Overall it was a great experience!

They made a homemade salty-buttery cracker that was unbelievable. There were even pickled strawberries. At first I was skeptical, but they were delicious.   Then an assortment of the freshest oysters we have ever had. Next was a beet (yes-BEET) carpaccio that was the most amazing dish I have ever eaten in my life!!!!!!! We also had a ceviche that would rival any Caribbean resort.  Next was a shrimp risotto and a calamari dish that were unbelievable.   THEN... we were served a charred yellowfin trout with grilled asparagus and  a side of tabouli salad.  Finished with a lemon curd, cheese and granola. Accompanied with a watermelon and cucumber-basil granita!    Hands down one of the best meals We have ever had. If you are near Rocksalt Charlotte we highly recommend stopping in for the Chef's Special. Say hi to Chef Jolene and Sierra for us. Well done ladies!!!!",

This one was made with goat cheese and white cheddar with peppadews!! Gave it a sweet and spicy bite to the tangy goat cheese.  Then we went for the fish cake sandwich.  The server didn't know what was in it, and we didn't either, but it was very well balanced with fish and fillers, then topped with a mustard remolaude and unique green tomato chow chow that added strong depth of flavors to the cake.  Surprisingly good and not just a normal menu of recipes.   Everything is unique with a few twists that make it fun!  Would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER.  We were so excited to try out this place, but very disappointed.  Such cool decor and so close to my house; I wanted it to be a local favorite like Good Food.  First of all, we were a party of 5 on Sunday evening.  The inside was pretty empty, but we wanted an outside table so we said we'd wait.  The hostess said it would be about 15-20 minutes; no big deal.  All 5 of us head to the bar.  We want to order a bottle of wine to share while we wait.  Although there are servers behind the bar, no one comes to take our wine order.  It takes about 15 minutes to get a bottle of wine and 5 glasses.  We keep waiting and a manager comes over and notices and says a table will be ready soon.  After about 40 minutes of waiting the original hostess comes over and apologizes - she forgot all about us!  Which is difficult to do since we were the only people at the bar.    So we finally get to our table after 40 minutes instead of 20.  By this time we are starving because we've waiting 40 minutes.  We've all got our meals picked out and as soon as the server comes we start ordering.  There was an appetizer special that we got for the table as well as several other apps to share.  I have to say, the only saving grace was the oysters.  They were all VA oysters and they were delicious!  Apparently they do a half price oyster special in the afternoons, but we missed it.  We order our main entrees.  When the appetizers come out, the server forgot to tell us he was out of the special.  He didn't even remember to tell us this - we has to ask where it was!  Then, my husband and another guest ordered a salad - but only one came out!  Again, the server never apologized or remembered.  It wasn't until we asked where it was that he realized he forgot it.  Lastly, we finished the first bottle of wine.  One of the guests asked for another bottle; instead they brought out a single glass!  They fixed that and brought out another bottle, but it was just annoying by this point.  Overall the food was decent; but pricey.  Again, the only way I would ever go back is to have the raw oyster happy hour.  And that's only because I LOVE raw oysters.    Such a disappointment!",

One diner had the \"coleslaw\" and it was actually a kale salad, which she did not enjoy.

We had to ask the question again to get the answers we needed.  Later, we found out that she was trying to leave and therefore was kind of rushing her attention. We'd give her a second chance because subsequent wait staff were very knowledgeable and helpful.   My date ordered the mixed grill that included a whole Spanish mackerel.  I ordered grouper.  More about both in a moment, but first, we ordered grits and Brussels sprouts as two sides.  The grits were good, infused with cheese but they were a little underdone.  But the Brussels sprouts? Oh, my.  Roasted with a sauce that included hints of anchovy, they sang a melody of flavor while capped with shards of succulent Romano, I believe.   And then there was the mixed grill.  My date was floored by the Spanish mackerel.  Chef was kind enough to remove the head for us before presentation, for it usually onlooks its own carnage.  She marveled at its tender, flaky freshness while savoring the tiny herbs that went along with every bite.  Despite a few annoying pin bones that can't be avoided in a whole fish, it was easily the star of her dish... however the two oysters and marinated shrimp held their on as side players to the fish's front man performance.    I had the grouper filet on a carpet of tossed baby greens in a simple spartan, yet effective dressing.  However, that by no means takes away from the delightful delicacy of those tender shoots when paired by fork with the grouper.  Lightly dusted with flour, then grilled... it was a signature, delightful piece of gastronomic splendor that left a clean, fresh, and delightful memory on my tongue.    Superbly seasoned, wonderfully presented and thoroughly enjoyed by both of us... the meal was magnificent.    Thank you Rocksalt, for a memorable night!",

Their creative makeover of an old dry cleaners is great, and when we set eyes on the place were pleasantly surprised. The decor is rustic yet trendy, and the open kitchen setup is entertaining.  Seeing as it was opening night they still had some kinks to work out. Waitstaff were overwhelmed, draft beers weren't in stock, and they had no Prosecco. Usually these types of issues should be handled during a soft opening but obviously weren't. We tried the three varieties of oysters and shrimp, and all of them weren't bad. The various sauces accompanying the raw bar assortment were great. The one thing that impressed me the most was the fact that they spent meticulous time shucking the oysters so no debris fell in.   We ordered a second round of drinks from the cocktail list, but were disappointed when the bar didn't have the necessary ingredients. This would be an instant red flag, but I let it slide giving the fact it was opening day. For entrees we had the sea scallops and crab cake, which were both good.   Overall I'm excited to have Rocksalt in the neighborhood, but they have a few bolts they need to tighten up in order to be successful in the long run.",

But l will have to keep trying the menu to find a favorite.   Adventurous desserts but needed a guiding hand on execution and flavoring.  We will be back soon to try more of the menu.",

The ceviche was served in a tiny cup about half the size I've experienced elsewhere. The location is poor. The restaurant is situated behind an old strip mall so while dining you you gaze out the window at cars and garbage dumpsters. Clearly the owner went cheap with site selection. Finally, the prices are on the steep side. End result: We won't be going back. On the lighter side, there is a Taco Bell across the street so when you leave and are still hungry after dropping a hundred bucks you can grab a burrito!",

It was our first time coming here for dinner and let me tell you the environment the waiters and waitresses basically the entire staff is very knowledgeable in the menu is amazing! The inside of the restaurant reminds me of an upscale vintage uptown type of vibe. Is very hip but simple the prices are very reasonable. The owner is a fourth-generation oyster farmer, therefore a lot of the oysters that come in to the restaurant from his farm. One of the reasons why I chose this restaurant is because it is a True farm to table. I definitely plan on coming back again and I would highly recommend making reservations because it gets really busy. They have ample outdoor seating but since it was raining the inside was very cozy but you have enough space that you're not on top of another patron.  Mickey was our waiter and he was phenomenal!",

No acknowledgement just walked away and casually brought them back, no mention of how long it took. Server was nice but so quiet and timid we could not hear her (I have no idea what the specials were OE what kind of oysters we were eating). She was overwhelmed being the only server outside with no help.  Had to take our check inside to ask them to speed up the process of getting out of there, again nobody seemed helpful.

The server even told us she was getting the manager to \"light a fire under the kitchen\" but no one really came around to check on us (even though the manager was chatting up other tables) as we waited and waited and waited. This might have been forgivable if the food was uniformly amazing, but it was not. It started off fine -- oysters were fresh and good, with tasty but not overwhelming sauces. But my main entree fish was super bland, and the rest of my dining companions had the same complaints about their entrees. And I love a good Sazerac but my cocktail was only a mediocre Sazerac so I didn't feel like ordering a second one to keep me busy. With so many great restaurants in Charlotte trying to make a good impression during Queen's Feast it seems like they're completely missing the boat.",

Very small and thin, and the vinegar is overpowering. A nice mignonette would be better.  Nothing comes to the table to start or without charge, not even bread or crackers with the oysters.  I ordered the whole grilled fish and my hubs the braised short rib.  They took an hour to arrive and both were inedible.  The fish was mush and was served with nothing except some radish slices and something billed as chimichurri, but was not even close. The short ribs were desiccated  and on a bed of sweet potato puree, which was super sweet and gummy. The hostess wound up writing off both entrees.  I can only hope this was a very off night and not normal, but I got the distinct feeling from the hostess that this happens all too often.  Be warned.",

    "text": "Really would like to wrap this review up with one word: meh - but I'm sure you would like to have some details.  First of all, it's gorgeous. Very pretty. Someone put a lot of thought (and money) into the feel of the place. It makes you excited and hungry when you walk in.   Then...we ate.  We didn't experience any service issues. We were prepared for that since there were so many reviews that stated this was an issue. Bar did seem a little slow, as it wasn't busy and it took a smidge to get our drinks, but that's overcome-able. (What? It's a word!) Server was friendly and nice. Order was speedy. Hostess was pleasant and not snotty (as Myers Park can sometimes be.)  The crux of the problem was the food. We started with oysters, which were quite yummy. Had a variety of the three different flavor notes. Cleaned perfectly and fresh, but this is where the 'meh' begins. Their horseradish was bland. I'm not sure how that's even possible, but it had no kick at all. And the mignonette (vineger & shallots) was mostly just...vinegar. Very sour and no high-point or flavor. I ended up just eating the oysters sans sauces.  We also ordered the tuna appetizer. The flavor of the tuna was wonderful. Marinated excellently, and again, very fresh. However every now and again, you'd bite into a huge chunk of ginger. I love ginger, but large chunks of it is too overwhelming for me. Literally had to stop eating it for fear of the ginger-burning. (I'm referring to food, people! Not gingers! Although...my partner is a redhead...so nevermind, it works both ways!)  Our entrees were underwhelming. I ordered the scallops because I'd read so many reviews about their yumminess. I was terribly disappointed. They came to the table and the server poured broth on them. I wish they hadn't. Made the entire meal just...soggy. And the greens and beans that complimented the scallops were absolutely tasteless.  I would've thought that perhaps my tongue was broken for the evening - like maybe my taste buds were dead, but then my partner's dirty rice arrived. (He had to order an extra side because the crab cake \"entree\" was simply one small crab cake on a piece of lettuce.) If you don't like liver...don't order this rice. There was nothing on the menu indicating that they made their dirty rice with chicken livers. Perhaps \"True\" dirty rice has chicken livers. I've never put it in mine, but I don't know - I'm not an executive chef. But you bite into the rice expecting...uh...rice - and all ya' taste is liver, liver and then...there's some liver. Aaaand, as you've probably figured out, I hate liver. So does my partner.  They were absolutely cordial and courteous about removing it from our tab, but this was kinda' the last straw. We are notoriously the \"perfect table\" - i.e. drinks, apps, two entrees, desserts, coffee - but we decided we didn't want to risk dessert.  I will pay for a meal. But $27 for watery, tasteless scallops and $18 for A crab cake...and rice that makes you want to throw-up - not worth the money.  I usually will give a place another run...every restaurant has it's off night, but this one just isn't worth the risk.  Sorry RockSalt. Super cool concept, but seriously missed the mark with the food. I'll give 'em two stars since the front-of-the-house rocked it, but you really need to revamp your product - enough so that it hits the Charlotte restaurant gossip channels - before I'm going to risk $100 for mediocre food again.   But then again - you are in Myers Park - you'll probably do just fine.",

Maybe its a tactic to make you order drinks or something. You begin to feel so hungry while you wait for them to go to the Atlantic ocean and get oysters and then drive back to Charlotte! They have good food  just do not expect it to come any less than 25 - 30 minutes. The location is okay. Inside is small with nice wood decor. The outdoor patio would be nicer if you weren't technically in a parking lot. Overall a good place to get some oysters and drinks if you really have lots of time to wait.",

I'm sure this isn't a secret by now, but they've been doing this special for a few months now.   These aren't crap oysters either....all from the Chesapeake Bay area, the three available options (right now anyway) range in personal beauty from sweet to brinier in flavor....served with minionette, fresh horseradish, a wedge of lemon, housemade cocktail and hot sauce. Phenomenally cleaned every time. I recommend asking for a side of the grilled bread.  Service has always been on point as well. Go and see for yourself.",

(Although I saw in another review the $1 specials went to the end of the year...I ate here in December...not sure if it still is True for 2016). At the end of the night, I ordered the panna cotta - visually artistic and a delicious way to end the meal.    The service was great, friendly, and understanding to new patrons trying to figure out the menu.  Terrific space. Intimate, clean, rustic, yet modern. I think it would make for a great first date spot or your 1003rd date spot. Either way, it seemed just right and just what the Queen City needs.",

    "text": "As GOOD as IF not BETTER Than Upstream!  Paul's Yelp Elite Review Rating: 4.75 Stars  So I debated (inside my own noggin) what my 300th Yelp Elite Review should be. Commander's Palace? 4 stars. Nope. I really wanted something that spoke to the masses....an \"undiscovered\" find that needs to be communicated to the masses. Well let me tell you that my 300th review was given to Rock Salt! Why? 5 STARS!  I was somewhat hesitant because I did read all the somewhat negative reviews on Yelp. I said, WHAT can cause an upscale Seafood place to be so bad? I mean, I DO trust (but verify) my fellow Yelp Brothers/Sisters so I just had to check this place out for myself. And I am SOOOOOOOOOOO glad I did!  This USED to be a Laundry Mat! Yup. The ventilation is there and all. However, I think they've done a phenomenal job in renovating this place and adding a modern kitchen to make it into what it is today: a casual yet chic seafood restaurant.  Came with a friend to experience what this was all about. I mean, I pass it all the time when visiting other Park Road establishments. Started out with their Raw Bar. Got 4 of the Rappahannock Oysters from Virginia. They claim that ALL their seafood is brought in fresh daily. Added a couple of Jumbo Carolina Shrimp just to see if that claim was True. Well? IT IS! The Oysters were VERY fresh and DELICIOUS! But what truly shocked the $hit out of me was what they call a \"Boo Ya\" sauce. This is the Chef's version of a \"cocktail sauce.\" But my friends, this is NO ordinary \"cocktail sauce\" that you can get at Teeters. Nooooooooooooo, this is a FRIGGEN AMAZING sauce made from fresh chilis, and it had a PERFECT balance of Sweet, Heat, Sour, Bitter and Salt.....The Oysters added the Umami for the last sense. I ate the remnants of that sauce right out of the cup. YUP, THAT good!  Collectively we got the Crab Cake and Sea Scallops. My GOD were the Crab Cakes ever delicious! Why? They used VERY little filler. It seemed to be ALL CRAB! And they provided that \"Boo Ya\" Sauce. Folks, I'm telling ya, that Boo Ya sauce would taste good on your Cat's Turd! That's my story and I'm sticking too it! I told the waiter that the Chef really needs to bottle it and sell it. I'm good for a CASE of it!  The Sea Scallops were perfectly seasoned and that brown butter sauce was divine!  I read the reviews about the food being \"no spiced enough.\" Well folks, this is SEAFOOD! Seafood is DELICATE. Look, I'm a BOLD SPICE kind of guy. I get it. But Seafood needs to be treated with kid gloves and respect. The flavors of the sea need to come out, and I feel that Rock Salt did s FABULOUS job in respecting that boundary!  The service that was provided by Mickey was great! I asked him if I could speak with the General Manager, and he sent over Jessica. She was cordial as I pitched a potential Yelp Elite or Unofficial Yelp Event. She said ABSOLUTELY!  Look this place isn't \"cheap\" as GOOD QUALITY Seafood rarely is. Their wine list is limited and somewhat pricey. I think they can improve on that (hire me!). But overall I'd HIGHLY recommend Rock Salt! It appears that they've worked out whatever \"kinks\" they had in their food and/or service.  So Nikki and/or Tonya, let's hit up Rock Salt for a GREAT evening of great food and fun.   Oh, their Patio is HUGE! GREAT place to bring a group to enjoy a warm Carolina night and their great food. Just tell them that the big bald guy sent you!",

Oysters were good.  Dessert was pretentious and boring. Our server ignored us, which is pretty impressive given we were there for 2 1/2 hours.  Server did mention she would talk to management but the manager never bothered.  This was a HUGE waste of money.  I will definitely never ever come back here.",

It's a fish place, so we wouldn't order steak again, but it was what we were feeling at the time. Can't ever go wrong with Mexican street corn! And it's not on the cob, so it's easier to enjoy. There are half-price oyster specials throughout the week & weekend, which we can't wait to come back for.   Service was amazing. Our waiter, Mickey, was extremely friendly, informative & helpful.  Ambiance outside on the patio is just lovely. It's very open and big- not loud at all. Perfect lighting- would make a cute date night.  Highly recommend trying this restaurant out for yourself despite the mixed reviews. We'll definitely be back!",

The walls are exposed block and the ceiling is bare. It has a minimalist feel with interesting art and light fixtures. The space is small inside but their marble bar is spacious and includes a small raw bar. They offer a great selection of liquor and a number of specialty cocktails. The patio doubles the seating area (if not more.). The kitchen is out in the open which I always like. Unfortunately, with not one scrap of fabric anywhere, inside is very loud. If you want to hear your companions, sit outside.  We started off with the Greenway which is a selection of oysters, mussels, clams and shrimp. One of our party did not care for raw shellfish so we asked that they lightly steam the oysters, mussels and clams. They happily did so for us. The shrimp however was somewhat overcooked. We ordered the special whole fish with some extra sides and enjoyed it. For the price, I'll have to say the portions were not especially adequate.   Service was great at the bar and good at the table.",

Waitress whiffed on appetizers (didn't write them down, didn't remember until we asked after 15 minutes, apologized a little, but that was it - no manager inquired, no adjustment in the bill, no offer of dessert or anything, any of which would have been nice).   She had tables inside and outside, was running hard.  Food was slow to come, but well prepared - pork was good overall, though a little heavy on hazelnuts.  Beef tartare was fresh and good.  Ribeye was pricey and not very good - thin, fatty, not fairly priced for the size.  Kale was very good.  Second time is probably enough.",

Me and my husband were driving around between 9-10P.M. on a Friday and really didn't want to go to a \"bar food\", \"pizza\" or fast food place.  So after a few U-turns we decided to go back to the ROCKSALT labeled building!  (I'm glad someone decided to label the building that way). I quickly checked out some info online about it and we decided to go in. As soon as we walked out of the car, I saw the large flame heating lamps on the outside and seeing the low lit indoor space, I instantly fell in love!  The entire experience was beautiful and almost empty, maybe three other tables occupied!  From the decor when we went in, to the very kind people we were greated by, (total 3 during the eve).  I love their beautiful tables. The red wine I ordered was a bit pricy but delicious. They have good options of dark local stouts which made us happy!  The burger was fresh and delicious, the sweet potatoes were incredible, we just asked them for more butter sauce, we like our food \"saucey\". My swordfish steak was incredible, next time I will ask for no skin (not a fan). The waiter was very good at helping us get familiarized with our options, did everything by the book. The only not so pleasant end of our experience was the check at the end of our experience. But I guess for the type of experience we had, it was worth it. The photos are not too great because my phone camera doesn't do well without light.",

FYI the Romaine Salad is served warm. The lettuce is grilled.  It wasn't bad it just had an interesting flavor.  I didn't mind it but my friends thought it tasted weird and didn't like the heated dressing.    I was also surprised at how slow and quiet this place was for a Saturday night.

We came looking forward to our dinner since I had heard such good things, and was looking forward to some fresh fish.  2 of us ordered whole fish, which were up on the daily specials board. We were told they came with 2 clam, 2 oysters and 2 shrimp. Waiter came back and said they were out of whole fish. We decided to order filets instead. Asked if they came with the same 2 oysters, clams and shrimp and was told yes, no mention of an upcharge  My son ordered a drink. Felt it was too weak, tasted like soda and told the waiter. the waiter offered to replace it, but my son asked just for another splash of gin. Waiter said he'd bring a shot. Again, no mention of charge.   Got our 300+ bill (for 5 big eaters and drinkers) and had 2 $6 charges we didn't recognize and a $ 7.50 charge for a shot.   Asked the waiter who said the clams, oysters and shrimp only came with the whole fish, extra with the filets. Asked why we weren't told and he basically shrugged. Asked about the shot, and was told the drinks are all measured, that's the way it is. Told him to do what he had to do, and I'd do the same, and I would be writing an online review. He did not seem to care.   Then the manager came over. Asked what the,problem was, and I told her the same thing. She proceeded to tell me that I was wrong. The normal charge is $11 for the clams, oysters and shrimp, and I was only charged 6. She had quite the attitude. When I told her we were never told about the charge she basically rolled her eyes and again told me that I was wrong. I told her had I known about the charge, I would have said never mind - again the shrug and the eye roll.  When she brought back the check she told me that even though they were right, she took off the 2 $ 6 charges, but could do nothing about the $ 7.50 for the shot.  Unfortunately for them that is going to be a very expensive shot, since I am telling everyone  I can how awful the customer service is at this restaurant.   This is not the way I expect to be treated anywhere, much less when I am spending this kind of money for a meal. I get better service at Dunkin Donuts.  I have been in sales my entire life, and I would NEVER treat a customer this way even if they were totally in the wrong.  AVOID AVOID AVOID unless you feel like being treated like dirt.",

    "text": "So disappointed. We came here for a special Mother's Day meal! We ordered off the brunch menu. Food took a while as to be expected for Mother's Day. The side of bacon contained 4 small strips of bacon. Literally on piece of bacon cut into 4 pieces. They replaced the side once we showed them the amount we had received but the meal got worse. One entree was the chicken and biscuits. It was one biscuit and one piece of chicken (smaller than Chick-fil-A biscuit) oh and the bottom of the biscuit was burnt and the chicken undercooked and slimy. They replaced the entree but that meant waiting 17 minutes for a new one. Overall poor experience for such a special day.",

    "text": "Visited Rocksalt while in town celebrating our anniversary.  I was excited; I had read good reviews and RS was close to where we were staying.  Visually, RS is very inviting and beautiful.  I wasn't, however, impressed withith the food (--- even though I wanted to be as I was starving!!)  We live near the Rappahannock, and the hubs was excited to have fresh, seasonal oysters.  We had oysters from three sources, and the ocean oysters were delicious.  The other two types were not.  The wine I ordered was not as described, and hubs confirmed my assessment. I decided to simply not have wine, but the server was insistent (and not in a friendly or engaging manner,) that I try another recommend wine.  Better, but still not what I was expecting.  Regardless I drank it, as I didn't welcome continued interaction with our server. The portions were incredibly small (usually this doesn't bother me, but as I said -- Hungry!), uninspired, and expensive.  I LOVE to dine out and do so a fair amount of time. I love the celebration of a meal: the anticipation, the engagement of the senses - all of it!  While nothing (other than the oysters) was completely unappetizing, it seemed as if we were dealt one underwhelming blow after another.",

    "text": "We ate here on Saturday, February 13, 2016. It was busy but we were seated immediately. Our server was very prompt and explained that in addition to their regular menu they had a special four course menu to choose from. We opted to order off of the regular menu as four courses looked like a LOT of food! (Although the items on the special menu looked amazing) We split some oysters, the marinated tuna appetizer and the mountain trout entree. Everything was delicious! We plan on coming back and taking advantage of the weekday oyster special.",

    "text": "When Rocksalt first opened I was very excited to have a seafood restaurant closer and more casual than Upstream. I'm from the Bay Area so I love seafood more than anything. I was stoked to visit the spot that has casual industrial chic interiors (which can be a bit loud) behind Michaels at Park Road.   The first visit left a bit to be desired - my catch du jour was a bit dry and the service was iffy. But the dessert of deconstructed cheesecake with orange marmalade was one of the best desserts I'd had in Charlotte. But a seafood restaurant's got to deliver on seafood, amiright? I heard they got a new chef so I gave it another shot.  We visited with some people who came in from Colorado since they can't get good seafood and it blew their socks off. Everything we ordered was fantastic - the ceviche, they loved the fried artichoke, the 3 fish dishes were cooked to perfection and my salad with crumbled egg was great. But for me the highlight was the oysters. The server explained that the owner was a co-owner in Rappohannock Oyster Company so they bring them in fresh. These little beauties rivaled some great oysters we'd had in Boston. Yes! Finally oysters I can trust in CLT!   The budino for dessert was delicious too. Our server was a little spacey but otherwise it was a great experience under the stars on their open patio. Redemption!! I look forward to trying it again!",
