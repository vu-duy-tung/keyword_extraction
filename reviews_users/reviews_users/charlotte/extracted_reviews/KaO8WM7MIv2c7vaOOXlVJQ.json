Nothing you'll find in the 'tourism guide'.   Typical to many others scattered throughout all areas of the city.  But decent food for the $'s, fast service...Nice variety on the menu/daily specials.  I put it in to the same category as Liberty East, The Knife and Fork (gone now) and many others scattered about the city...Medium grade....You wont leave hungry, food is good for the $'s. You'll walk out filled up and content. Good meal for the $'s spent, fast service, which is a must at lunch hour.  you wont walk out saying 'terrific, I'll be telling all my friends'.....You will walk out satisfied with a full belly for the $'s spent..  Havent eaten there for awhile other then for breakfast, which I do a couple times a week. Great $5 breakfast- eggs, grits, hashbrowns or homefries, bacon or sausage or livermush of fried baloney...toast or biscuits....tea or coffee. Nothing great and other diners throughout the city offer something similar.  Americana is at least consistent. However your order your eggs, they are perfect everytime....super fast service....good price....  No complaints. I do put a few diners a step ahead, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner, but Americana is good for what it is. Typical medium grade diner you wont rush out and tell your friends about, but you'll leave satisfied. Fast and friendly service, in and out quickly with a good meal at a good price.",

They've got some pasta, great lasagne, and plenty of Southern cooking like collard greens and fried okra.  It's all fairly priced and while you won't stuff yourself, you won't leave hungry. It's the staff that makes it worth it.  Keep going back, and you'll notice the same faces for years.  They're all friendly, and they will start to remember you! Why 4 out of 5?  Simply because the food is good, but not life changing.  I can name a similar place relatively close that the food is better - but the staff and atmosphere isn't as \"family\" That's why I keep going back here!",

I opted to get the special which was fried chicken and gravy over mashed potatoes and 2 sides (they have plenty of side options and I chose fried squash and a salad). My mom got pork tips over rice with collards and a salad, and my dad chose pork chops with fries and a salad. The portions were great for the price (each entree roughly $7.95) and the food was tasty. My only issue was my fried chicken was a little dry. I could still eat it, but it definitely required sauce.   Overall great diner with reasonable prices and good service.",

And we have been a couple of times now and I was pleasantly surprised to find a great American diner right around the corner. Nothing beats the Americana for breakfast; cheap, delicious, and fast. It is becoming a Saturday morning tradition for me. Love their omelette and hash browns, and I also appreciate the honoring of our armed forces in the waiting area. Top shelf Americana.",

My fiance and I both had coffee and an entree for a whopping $16.00. I had an omelette with hash browns and both were good. We definitely plan on coming back. Come early or you might have to wait as the place was filling up when we left (we got there around 7:15 and sat right down). Wait staff was very friendly as well.",

Also ordered a side of fried squash which was excellent as usual.  Coleslaw was fine chopped, which is not my preference, but tasted slightly sweet and was crunchy and freshly made.  Fries a bit soggy and shoestring style. Portion good for me, but most people  would wonder why skimp on the fries.   Great service, as usual. Great prices. Just fell a little short on the food today :-(",
