I usually don't like the additions(jellies, bubbles, etc) but I really like their jellies. They have a taste and texture that almost can be confused for the real fruit and tastes awesome.  I tried the popcorn chicken- and they lose star - wasn't very good and was heavily breaded compared to similar products at other similar places.  Been twice in the same day so they can be addictive-drinks cost between 4-5 so not a cheap drink addiction.",

The ambiance of the place was great also! Lots of sitting space.

I'd recommend getting the mango drinks and refreshers. We got the coconut snow cream as well and it was alright. Some things are very overpriced but I guess for the atmosphere and the area it's alright. The staff is very kind. :)",

Everything we have tried so far has been fresh, flavorful, and unique.   My husband took me there on my birthday recently and surprised me with a beautiful table set up with rose petals and dessert. I am very grateful to Jimmy, the owner, and his staff for helping him set up a lovely surprise. It meant a lot to me and really made Tea Fusion more than just a cool place, but a genuinely friendly one.   You can read my first review for more details, but suffice to say you have a good chance of running into us there!",

I really enjoyed the huge menu board they had and display of desserts.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  Bathrooms were clean, and the cafe itself was family friendly.   I ordered the mega mango mason jar refresher. It was definitely delicious and presented so beautifully. (See pictures)  We also ordered the popcorn chicken, which I highly recommend you try and the desserts are an A ++ (The gentlemen -- who I believe who was the owner even offered advice for my child's eczema issue -- which I greatly appreciated.)  I definitely believe this spot is a hot spot to enjoy some delicious finger foods and flavorful teas.",

The inside of the shop is really clean and well laid out with a couple couches in one corner. They also have a few board games. It's the perfect place to hang out with friends, do homework, or just kick back with a book. They also have a lot of tea gift sets. Seriously, go give this place a try.

I ordered the grilled pork Banh Mi and a \"less sweet\" version of their passion fruit mason jar tea. The sandwich was beautiful with fresh cilantro, jalapenos and carrots. The bread was perfectly warm and soft with a crispy fresh baked crust. The pork, however was pretty tough. I wish I would have gotten a different meat, and probably will next time. The tea was a perfect finisher. Not too sweet, but just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. The fresh fruit was perfect, and who doesn't love crushed ice!?   I'm happy I stopped here. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I was really impressed by this place. You can tell that it's run really well!  First I wanted to say that it was late at night so we called to ask what time they closed. Girl on the other end of line was super sweet and even told us \"you have a good one\" before saying bye and hanging up. When was the last time you've called a business to ask questions and they did that? Not counting businesses where their calls are monitored and recorded??  Really cute spot. Small and cozy but plenty of seating and because it was a corner unit with lots of windows, it felt really open.   Order their Banh Mi Dac Biet, Korean BBQ Banh Mi, Avacodo Bubble Tea and Mangonada.   Their bread is perfect. And I mean it. Picking it up I thought that it would be too hard and dry. But biting into it was perfect. No resistant. No excessive crunch. No crumbling from being too dry. No chewiness from either being too \"meaty\" or use of microwave. Really, based on my opinion this is the PERFECT bread. It is not a 100% of a Vietnamese baguette, BUT, it is perfect for a Banh Mi.   The Dac Biet was very good!! Top 3 of every Banh Mi Dac Biet I've eaten (I was born and raised in OC California)... but, their Korean BBQ Banh Mi wasn't good. Tasted nothing like Korean BBQ, and it was way too salty.   The avocado bubble tea I got was nearly perfect! Jus the boba was on the harder side, but everything else was absolutely wonderfully. I loved it!!  Mangonada was a bit too sweet. If the avocado bubble tea was a 5 (being perfect), the Mangonada was a 15+ (way out of the ballpark) because it was literally at least 3 times as sweet.   Regardless, I really enjoyed my visit here. They draw quite a crowd so they definitely know what they're doing. My opinion is merely based on the fact that I was around when these kind of shops first popped up in CA some 20+ years ago, and it's just a opinion... this is better than 90% of tea/boba/Banh mi shops that's around anywhere! That's why they get a 5 star from me.",

    "text": "Charlotte's boba tea scene has been completely transformed. I first savored this sweet delicious drink in Michigan almost 20 years ago and realized how far behind Charlotte was. Whenever I was in Atlanta, I'd stop to get boba tea from the Asian venues because they could not be found back home. Over time, many Asian establishments started carrying their version of boba tea but the taste was always lacking. There was always something missing.  Welcome to the opening of Tea Fusion. Not only was I amazed from my first order of mango tea refresher, but I've become an even bigger fan after every visit and order since. This place is consistently amazing. Every drink, every banh mi, every choice is delicious. The sandwiches are filled with meat and topped with the most scrumptious and tangy pickled carrots. The drinks are the perfect balance of sweetness, tang, and fruit. The refreshers put Starbucks and Panera to shame. Pick your poison. They are all outstanding.  There's a sign at the register that tells you up front they do not offer refunds because they stand behind all of their products. I stand with them in this sentiment. If you don't like what you've ordered, it's not because they didn't do It well, it's because you have bad tastebuds. It's ok if you don't believe me. The hundreds of patrons who frequent this place proves you're wrong if you disagree.",

I was about to give 4 star until they put my hot drink in a cheap plastic cup (use for cold drink) as someone who works in the chemical field and a 9 month pregnant mom, I know how much chemicals are releasing from the given temperature. I told the cashier girl straight on just in case they are not aware of the situation, but she seems extremely careless and didn't even bother to tell the drink makers...  I guess customers health is not their concern. If you order the hot drink next time, do remember ask for the coffee cup...",

Their strawberry taste like powdered strawberry quik, and their coconut just doesn't seem real.  It's a huge Smoothie and the tapioca pearls are soft and chewy but they have much to improve, beginning with having TARO in stock.",

He is a coffee snob and he was impressed. I had the \"wild berry fusion\" which is a berry tea iced with bits of tapioca, apples , and berries. We also tried the macaroons and danishes. My husband's was a bit dry, but not surprising considering we stopped in at the end of the day. Can't wait to come back and try their bubble tea and cheesecakes.",

It tasted good but the prices was little high for the amount they give you. It comes it a box and look like such a small portions of it, not enough to share, or let alone one person. For price it should be given more. But overall it good staff was very friendly and the environment was clean will definitely return to have the  only for Manson jar tea again.",

I also like how they use crushed ice so I didn't have to dig around ice cubes to get to my jelly.  Husband got the mangonada and he loved it. It was made just as it should be--with the straw covered in the sour candy thing. (I have no idea what it's called but if you like mangonadas, you'll know what I'm talking about).  The service was great, and we didn't have to wait long for our orders. There were other patrons in the shop on their laptops studying, etc. So it seems like a good place to chill and get work done.",

It's a very relaxed and chill environment. You order at the front and can find a seat to wait for your order number to be called. Prices are reasonable to me, especially being in the Charlotte area. The mango and passionfruit refreshers were amazing! They came out both looking the exact same in color, but taste very different. Each tea has cut-up fruit, chia seeds, and jelly inside. The Banh mi was also delicious and the tiramisu was one of the most authentic tiramisu's I've had (wasn't expecting that at all). If you're into trying fun Asian teas or want a low key place to hang out and eat some Banh mi or finger foods, check out Tea Fusion!",

    "text": "I think I found where all of the cool kids hang out during the day or at least that's what it felt like when I decided to work there for a couple of hours one day last month.  I was on my way home from a mid-day appointment and figured it would be the perfect time to finally pop into Tea Fusion. It's located right off of WT Harris, in the Total Wine shopping center right across from the hospital and library.   I arrived around 2:30/3:00 and a steady stream of people followed. Thanks to reading up on the place beforehand, I knew I already wanted a bubble tea (when in Rome, amiright?). I ended up ordering an avocado bubble tea since they were out of the taro flavor when I visited. They have a brightly lit menu board and will explain any menu items should you have questions. I witnessed the employees do this for a couple of people.  While I set up my laptop, one of the kind employees informed me that the wifi password was available on my receipt. A few moments later, my bubble tea was ready and I excitedly took a hearty sip. I will say, you will find out if you fall into one of two camps: those who like the taste of the boba pearls  and those who don't. I happen to be in the former group and will look forward to trying all of the flavors they offer.  While I worked and sipped my tea, the place really got busy. There a was long line for quite a while and the tables filled up around me. The crowd was very youthful and most seemed to be regulars. I saw plenty of people ordering the shaved ice cream and those pretty mason jar drinks.  There is so much I look forward to trying and am thankful to have another place to bring my more adventurous out-of-town friends.",

Growing up in Vegas, it was always just a \"thing\" to go meet friends for boba, eat chicken, and just chill. I have now found my Charlotte version of this!  The korean bbq bahn mi was delicious - the meat was tender and sweet with the right about of veggies. I wish the bread was a little more crispy, but I'll take it.  We also had the popcorn chicken. So hot, freshly made, and served in a little box with sticks to grab it with. It has a slight spice to it, but not too much. Just great.  My ONE complaint is that the tapioca balls are not my favorite ones I've had. I've been to this place twice - the first time, they were a little small (for my liking). The second time, they tasted slightly undercooked. This place definitely has the best boba I've had in North Carolina, but not a 100% winner.   I will definitely come back! I'll also give an update on the tapioca verdict next time.",

What to get: The Pineapple Special Drink they recommend What else: If your Mac computer tells you it's 3.14, that's Pi on Apple.  I don't want to cause Con Fusion, but I have to say that despite all my semi positive Bubble Tea reviews in North Carolina, that NC doesn't really have good bubble tea. Not compared to what I am used to.  However Tea Fusion is as close as it gets. The decor is wonderful, the girls serving here are extremely friendly, happy, and if they were single you'd want to date them. I don't actually know if they're single, I'm just trying to put you off from trying to date them in case they actually are.  I ended up ordering 3 drinks here (typical me) because they kept recommending different things. It was easily my most fun experience in Charlotte, although I'll be in town again tomorrow so maybe I'll find something even more fun. So to speak.  The regular milk tea and other milk teas are good, but the Pineapple special drink that they rave about (with all the crazy bits in it) is by far the star of the show. It's a little sweet, but I enjoyed it and it refreshed me like a wet kipper to the face back in old bonnie wee Scotland me lassie.  Aye.",

The black menu showcased various fruit teas, bubble teas (smoothies), milk teas, and hot drinks. My eyes, however, instantly locked on the milk tea section, spotting my favorite, green milk tea. I eagerly ordered that with grass jelly while my coworker got a strawberry bubble tea with pearls.   But my eagerness faltered just a bit when I caught a glance of my boba that was...green?  I don't remember green milk tea being green (ironic, now that I think about it). I hesitantly popped the lid and took a small sip before the familiar taste of matcha hit my tongue. While I understand why this would be called green milk tea, I can't say that I didn't feel somewhat tricked...It wasn't the drink I was expecting at all.  That's not to say I'm not a fan of matcha. I most certainly do like the flavor, but Tea Fusion Cafe made the drink a bit too powdery. I didn't like the chalky aftertaste hanging around on my tongue. However, I did like how they used crushed ice and that the grass jelly was silky, even though the pieces all floated to the top.  I was alarmed that in terms of prices, Tea Fusion Cafe closely matched those in the Bay Area. I thought California was always going to be more expensive when compared to North Carolina, but clearly that isn't always the case. Perhaps the lack of demand raises the price?  When it comes to boba, though, I don't think there are a lot of states that can compete with the plethora of choices in California, but to see that Charlotte had at least one was a pleasant surprise. It may not have been perfect, but it was good enough for me to finish the cup with a smile.",

Adding boba to the tea is optional so I tried it until I accidentally swallowed one and didn't like the texture! The only thing I suggest is different size opts for the drinks. It seemed what I ordered only came in one size and it was a bit much. Other than that I really like the  casual atmosphere and various seating opts. I look forward to trying some of their food items.",

I love the big, white flowery looking light fixture. Morgan F and I each got one of the mason tea jars (mega mango and wild berry fusion), some edamame, and a banh mi. All of the mason tea jars have fresh diced fruits, chia seeds, and jelly (of some sort). On top of a huge seleciotn of teas and bubble teas, they also have Vietnamese coffee, French press, and fruit slushies. They also have a snack type menu, banh mi sandwiches, and a dessert case. I restrained myself from getting green tea cheesecake.   Free wi-fi. Clean. Cute little flowers on the tables. I saw a couple people playing board games. So, what really put this place over the top for me? Customer service. He helped us order and explained menu items. When we were leaving, we both still had drinks left. We were about to leave them behind, when he came up to offer making them to go cups. Sealed, new straw, and everything.",

You do not understand the excitement inside me as I write this review!   Initially, here's a little tea 101. There are 3 different types of teas: Fruit Teas, Milk Teas and Boba Teas. Fruit teas are fruit-infused teas with little bits of fruits and fruit jellys. The boba tea is a slushee and boba are little tapioca pearls. Milk tea is simply a mix of milk and tea :) My favorites are the Passion Fruit Tea with bits of fruits (and I add boba!), the traditional Milk Tea and the Taro Milk Tea (I add grass jelly to both - I understand that sounds weird, but it's delicious!).  I've also tried the Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and would recommend getting the Fusion Special, Grilled Pork or Lemongrass Chicken. P.S. They also have a couple of vegetarian options (Tofu and Fried Egg) :)",

They have a variety, as the name would certainly suggest - in fact, it's a decent sized menu based on the tea alone.  But they do in fact have a few food offerings, and featured right there over the counter you can see that they have banh mi (a little off to the side you can see some appetizer-like offerings too).  Now there are a few places in town to get banh mi, incuding one not a couple hundred feet away, another down Tryon, and a variety of others, and I would have to say that if this is the reason you are here, you should probably stick to the tea. Perhaps add a side of popcorn chicken, because that is downright tasty. If KFC gets a hold of this recipe, it might bring the colonel back to life, and not just the variety that you'll see in those strange spots on the tube right now - the real deal colonel.  It's also certainly not that the staff isn't helpful. They are friendly and the drink-sealing machine (even for water!) is pretty cool. You might want to go just to check that out. But the banh mi can be had better at other places, so keep that in mind.",

I was greeted upon entering. I spent a few minutes looking at the menu which consisted of a variety of hot and cold drinks with several toppings options. They also serve snack items mainly fried: popcorn chicken, fried tofu, etc as well as different variations of banh mi.   I decided on the following: Green tea milk tea $3.50 + boba $.50                         Taro milk tea $3.50 + boba $.50  Both teas had bold flavors, not the artificial kind. I like my bubble teas on the sweeter side and theirs wasn't that sweet. Maybe I can ask for more sweet next time. The tapioca pearls had great texture and flavor.  If I'm ever in the area again, I will probably stop by and try another drink and a banh mi!",

Parking:  They are located in a very busy strip mall near the corner of N. Tryon and W.T. Harris (University section of town) behind the I-Hop.  They are located on the back of the mall closest to Ashley Furniture so it is a bit tricky to find them unless you are familiar with their exact location.  I was able to pull up and park right outside of their door to run inside and grab a drink to go.    Staff:  Nothing noteworthy except that there was no \"welcome to . . . no good afternoon, no pleasantries at all.  It is possible that something more was going on but they did not appear to busy at the counter when I walked in.   Now of the 15 tables, there were people seated at about half but they had already been served.  The cashier took my order for a Mango Bubble Tea.  What I like is that you can get any type of tea, fruit or other special healthy choices in your drink.  They make each order special for you and when your drink is complete it is sealed in the cup.  You must pierce the cellophane wrap to insert your straw.  This seems very good (even sanitary) to me and makes it extremely easy to transport multiple drinks for groups.  For $5 and some change, it was worth it.  The drink was delicious, quenched my thirst and lasted a very long time.  Although I did not partake this time, the food is delicious and the desserts look scrumptious.  I will have to try them the next time to see which one will be the best.",

So my friend and I decided to come and try it. We had a fried chicken box and a taro boba tea. The fried chicken smelled so good, tasted very crispy on the outside and juicy inside! The boba tea was also tasty and definitely worth the money.  This restaurant (I believe) is a Vietnam restaurant. It has many seats and even a couch area for hanging out. The parking is plenty since it is in a plaza. They offer free WiFi and a restroom to use as well. Overall it is definitely a great place to have some food and drink, and study or work for an afternoon, or just hanging out with friends and playing some board games.",

They have a great selection of teas with different toppings. And they also have slushies made from tea. So I order the fried shrimp with strawberry lemon slush, popcorn chicken with grape slush, and pot stickers with the mango slush with cayenne peppers in it. The chicken definitely had some extra stuff kind of seasoning on it which made it different. It was pretty good. The shrimp and the pot stickers did not have anything extra on them. The drinks were good but the mango extraness was not that great to me. I could not finish it. Definitely a spot that I would return to to try other items on the menu. One thing that stood out the most was the fact that they place plastic over the tops of the cups. You poke the with the straw they give in order to drink. Pretty cool and mess free!",

I tried the Red Bean Milk Bubble Tea, and it was very good...but the temperature of the drink could have been a tad colder.  Also, think I expected to see more selection of desserts.  Though they had a few tempting items (Macaroons and Cakes), they lacked my favorites - the fluffy Pastries!  The place itself was just as snazzy as expected...Cute, cozy and lively.  Overall, despite a few complaints, I really liked this cafe.  If only there was another one closer to South Charlotte.:(  On my next long trip to the north side of town, I hope to check out another flavor of tea...and hopefully, it'll be colder?",

It was a little on the dry side. The mangonada is a mango smoothie with a tamarind candy straw, chamoy sauce and Tajin seasoning. In the evening, they put out candles on the table for ambience. They sell banh mi sandwiches, popcorn chicken/shrimp. tofu, shaved ice, macarons and much more. They have lounge chairs/couch inside as well as regular tables. There was a pretty diverse group of customers here. I liked that the passion fruit tea came in mason jars and had fruit garnishes outside. The tamarind candy on the straw was really soft. I've had the same tamarind straws before that were hard/stale.",

I ordered the Fusion Special Banh Mi ($4.99) and a Blended Green Tea Boba Tea ($4.75).  Service was fairly quick, with my order coming out in about 7 minutes.  Good presentation, fresh food and very tasty.  I've had larger Banh Mis but not at this price point.  Couple of critiques: 1) I wanted to combine green tea flavor and avocado flavor in my Boba Tea and was told that you can't mix flavors.  After looking at the menu later, it specifically states that mixing flavors is .50..  not sure which is accurate, so I'll just try again next time ;).  2) The Fusion Special Banh Mi had a great flavor, but there was quite a bit of fat on the pork, so much that I had a few bites that were all fat.  I'm not sure if this is normal for that pork or just the luck of the cut I got today.  I'll try the Lemongrass Chicken next time..  Overall, great food, service, atmosphere and Boba Tea.  I'll definitely be returning here again.",

I got the mega mango tea and it was delicious on a hot day! I love all the little jellies and apple pieces in my tea. To me it's definitely the lychee jellies that make the tea awesome. I also tried their grilled pork banh mi but sadly it's not the bomb. I've had better elsewhere. Not only that, they do not put alot of meat in there. They were definitely being cheap about that, however, the meat honestly tasted good and well marinated. The picked carrots and daikon didn't even have a pickled taste. That was disappointing because I do like the pickled taste in a banh mi.   Also, I did get a green milk tea to go with boba. That was disappointing. It wasn't sweet enough. At least the boba was delicious? If I'm in town again, I will get some more flavored teas but not the banh mis.",

Boba tea houses are places I always search for when I'm somewhere new, and I accidentally stumbled upon this place. Before going in, my husband and I saw that it had a 5 star rating so we decided to try it. Definitely lives up to the rating expectations. In addition to a few of the milk tea drinks and frozen bubble teas, we got a bulgogi sandwich, which is something we have never had before, and that was the most tender and marinated bulgogi I've ever tasted. If you are looking for a place to hang out to kill time for a little or just chat with friends, this is the place to be. The seating area inside is very clean and open, they have a couple of couches if you want to sit a little more comfortably. I am just visiting the Charlotte area for the weekend, but I will definitely come back!",

We ordered calamari for the table and it also delicious.   We told our coworkers how good it was and they wanted to go with us.  So, today we went back.  Today, I had the Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi and Strawberry Kiss Tea Mason Jar Refresher.  The chicken was a tad too salty, but the overall flavor was good.  The strawberry tea was good, but not as good as the mango.  For people who don't like overly sweet drinks, strawberry is for you.  We ordered calamari and popcorn chicken for the table.  Calamari was better hands down.  I'll definitely visit again and try something new.  But, I'm thinking that the grilled pork and mango tea from my first visit will be hard to top. Also, the staff is very nice and helpful if you questions about any of the food or drinks.",

Tea Fusion Cafe is different in that it gives you more variety and better quality tea for the same price you would pay for your typical boba. The other menu options are also great as well. I would definitely recommend the items I got, which were a very aesthetically pleasing Mango mason jar tea along with some Taiwanese popcorn chicken that had an amazing flavor and crunch. The cafe had a very relaxed and homelike vibe to it, with futons and games lying around, and it felt like I was hanging out in a lounge. I found that there were a lot of college students when I went, which is probably due to the cafe's close proximity to UNCC. I would definitely recommend this place as a nice place to hangout with friends for lunch or spot to grab some treats with the family!",

The waitress that assisted me was very friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu items offered.  It was recommended that I try the Taro Bubble tea, as I have not had it before. I ordered the Taro Bubble tea, calamari, and edamame, which all were very delicious!  In addition to the ambiance, great menu, and friendly staff, board games are also available for you to enjoy, along with plush couch seating.

The moment you walk in the door they automatically treat you like family! They keep the Area full of college students and budgets in mind with their prices....  It doesn't hurt that I have nothing bad to say about their food either! ;) My family and I ordered: Popcorn chicken.... YUM! Each piece of chicken is bitesize and very tender with this awesome seasoning on it! #fingerlickingood !  Fried oysters .... They definitely do not skimp on the oysters and the batter is nice and flaky. Fried calamari.... So much of it, goes amazingly well with the sauce that comes with it. Fried fishballs... holy cannoli these were scrumptious!!!!!!!!! Think..... Crab cake meets tofu texture! Plus the sauce they drizzle on it!!!??? To die for!! We ordered 3 different teas.... We slurped them down so fast I wish I could breakdown the taste for you....  Do not miss out on this place.... You'll regret it! Thank you tea fusion for existing in my life!",

They have a nice selections of teas and other beverages that you can customize.  Other than the mason jar teas, I recommend the butterfly pea tea. It's not so pretty. I haven't had the food because I have allergies and can't eat a majority of what's on the menu. But there's something for everyone. They also have ice cream, that I will try when it gets a little warmer. I wish I lived a closet but glad I don't because they would have ALL of my money.",

The snacks are wonderful, the desserts delicious, and those \"mason jar refreshers\" ALONE are worth the trip. The Cafe is fairly new and the menu is slowly growing. There's not enough places like this in Charlotte. Vote with your dollars people! Don't walk, RUN to Tea Fusion Cafe. You won't regret it ;)",

It's a really inviting space with lots of tables and couches in a stylish setting. During our short visit, we were provided amazing service and were even shown how to enjoy the tea from the owner!

Well let me being with this:   So i  visit this place a couple of times, but i mostly go for the drinks, which are really good.   But the food could be better.   The first time i came with my husband to meet up with our friend and we go their bugoggi ( i think thats how you spell it) sandwhich, and one of their appetizer the popcorn chicken. Well let me start off by saying that the appetizer was nothing but breading didnt have much meat on them and taste like it was store bought.   The sandwhich wasn't that good neither, the sandwhich didn't have much flavor. To me it was salty and there was hardy any veggies on the sandwhich or meat. The sandwhich had only 2 strips of meat. Tonight i went there to get me some drink and i got hungry so i got me a grilled pork sandwhich but this sandwhich had no flavor either and just like the other sandwhich it only had 2 strip hardy any veggies.  From my experience i would go there for drinks but not food unless your hungry.   There is another Banh Mi place that just open in the next shopping center and i have to say their food is better.",

They also allow you to mix flavors so I went with taro and coconut mix. Perfect combination. They have special menu items only available on the weekends such as their tofu pudding and vegetarian/tofu banh mi. They don't skimp on their veggie/tofu banh mi.

    "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE!! The managers/owners here are literally the sweetest people ever! I remember when they first open I would see them behind the counters a lot, but not much since then this place got pretty popular(I mean how could it not). They would always greet you with a smile every time you walk in & greet you when you walk out! I would literally come here every weekend for their refreshing drinks or boba, but they added A LOTTA things to their menu since. I always have such a struggle choosing what I want from their menu because there's too much!! (Annnd all they're missing is a rose milk tea *hint *hint (; LOL) I recommend trying their passion fruit tea, omg it's literally so friggin refreshing and good. & ITS SO PRETTY! The decor is also so lovely, it's a really cute hangout spot so bring your friends!!",

    "text": "There's everything to love & everyone is incredible! Banh mi - I love theirs! I think the \"smear\" I don't what to call it,  a form of mayo but not mayo taste different from other places.  It's strong enough to be distinctive but it's not too much,  & personally that's one of the main things I like about a banh mi. It may look like a simple sub but to get it right, there's almost a science to it.  And you don't have to figure it out bc here they did it for you so go for it! The classic is great but the unique options they offer are not to be passed up!  The teas! Just delicious. They're all good but winter melon is my favorite.  Along with their beautiful fruit infused teas with delicious mix of toppings,  they even offer coffee to pistachio frappe to the delicious & beautiful mangoritas wide range of goodies for suuuuure! Open as late as 11, big surprise & a plus! But don't keep them any later  than that please! It's just a good to know bc sometimes I'm off late & appreciate that this is an option.",

I would definitely recommend the cafe sua da for coffee lovers and the tuxedo cake is to die for! Banh mi is also good too if you're wanting something light to eat.",

Banh mi have been added to the menu and they were good. They need a veggie one for my vegan days :). Hopefully soon.  Anyway, yes, love this place!",
