    "text": "I was craving Mexican, well Americanized Mexican, so I went to Don Pedro's.  It was a Sunday afternoon about 1 pm and the restaurant was very busy, but I was able to get a table right away.  The basket of chips and bowl of salsa appeared right away too.  The chips and salsa were OK, but I've had better.    My waiter came by and got my drink order not shortly there after.  While waiting for my drink I decided on the Deluxe Burrito.  The server came back with my drink and took my order.  The staff seemed very friendly and even though the restaurant was about 80% full the were taking care of business.  I even spotted a manager or two wandering through the room checking on things as well.  It is always a good sign when you see management doing that.  My burrito came out pretty quickly.  The burrito & the plate were super hot, temperature wise, and the server was quick to warn me about that when he set it down on the table.  The burrito was big, covered with melted cheese, and loaded up with sour cream and guacamole.  I had to wait a couple of minutes for it to cool down past molten lava stage to take a bite.  It was pretty good, I wished I had looked at the menu closer as it didn't come with rice and beans.  But, it was big enough to fill me up so it really didn't matter.  The food is pretty good, nothing to wow you, but tasty non the less.  The service was outstanding.  Even with the restaurant being 80% full with several large tables I always felt taken care of.",

Don Pedro's from the outside may look a little run down and old, but that did not take away from the great customer experience. Sever was very attentive and friendly. I LOVE guacamole, so I was thrilled when I saw the guy come around making fresh guacamole in front of me. All in all, food was average, but the great customer service we experienced was deserving of 4 stars.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Don Pedro's for years now, and at this point would probably need a 12 step program to stop.  In fairness, I tend to find one thing on a menu that I love and stick with it forever. I have been sticking with chicken fajitas, arroz con pollo, and bites of my husband's chicken burrito when he's not looking. All of them are great! It's sort of hit or miss as far as how much of any one ingredient you're going to get in the fajitas, but I've never felt like I was robbed of something. I am also incapable of coming in here without ordering a big bowl of liquid cheese. Although I order \"queso\", and every time the servers, all of whom speak Spanish as a first language, confirm by asking \"cheese dip?\", probably because they don't want to assume cultural responsibility for what is essentially a bowl of melted white american cheese with diced jalapenos. They should take ownership, because it's so good that I really only use the endless baskets of delicious chips to consume it because eating the cheese with a spoon or a straw would be rude. The complimentary pico is almost always fantastic- surprisingly fresh. The complimentary salsas are not my favorite. They taste almost ketchup-y.  The staff is great. They're so nice and friendly- I adore Vanessa, who has an uncanny memory, and who has a closer relationship with my kids than my own sister does. Vanessa is always polite, friendly, efficient, and does her job well. With other servers I get exceptional service probably 90% of the time, with the other 10% being described as \"really good service\".  Prices are great, although I should note I only go for lunch. I think lunch fajitas are $7, and the portion size is good. I always have leftovers (this could be partially because I eat my own weight in chips and cheese dip before lunch arrives).  The ambiance is what you would expect. It's a big space, and clean, but with that vague hint that maybe all of the patterns and colors are hiding uncomfortable amounts of dirty. Whatever, I can't confirm it, and I've never seen anything to suggest it, so it clearly doesn't bother me too much.  Overall, clearly I love this place or I wouldn't keep coming back.",

The plus side was the extremely friendly waiter and good, quick service; the fresh-made guacamole was flavored just right too.  However, when our main dishes came out, it started going downhill.  One of our orders was overcooked the first time around, but they were really good about it and got it sorted out.  I got a combo platter, and the beans and rice didn't offer much in the taste department.  As another reviewer said, it almost tasted like they came straight from a can.  The meal overall seemed like it relied and overdid it with cheese.  Despite this, I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt though, and I would give it another go.  It's got good reviews long-term for a reason, and maybe the dish I ordered just wasn't for me.",

We never get that because my fiancee normally goes for the Queso dip.    They have Victoria Beer there but it is not on the menu.    I asked for an Arbol Chili sauce and they had some!  I was pretty impressed by that and that's why I am giving 5 stars.  The Arbol Chili sauce is hot so if you want to impress your friends you should get it!",

Five minutes later our waitress arrived not very friendly at all. I  order sopa de tortilla witch I usually enjoy having (even when is hot). 20 minutes later pass after a got my soup. it was served in a huge bowl, boiling hot.the taste was nasty it tasted like water with grease and dry chile.big chunks of chicken I mean DISGUSTING ...THE waitress didn't bother to ask how the foo d was.she took my bowl exactly how it was  served! poor service & flavorless food. never coming back!!",

First problem was encountered in the parking lot when we came upon vomit in a parking space near the front door.  Not a good first impression.  The salsa was okay but a bit spicy for our tastes.  The cheese dip that we ordered first was watered down and really tasteless.  One in our party had a small change to her order which didn't happen in the first round, and when it was brought back, it still wasn't right.  The \"small plates\" on the menu came out on plates the size of pizza pans with lots of beans and rice to fill the space.  In some cases this would be a good thing but when you're looking for a small plate, not so much.",

This place is much like the run of the mill Mexican eatery but the finishes are just a tad bit of an upgrade in relation to most.    The service is great and attentive.  We were there on a Sunday and there were a couple VERY large parties of people being taken care of so they know how to deal with larger groups.    Table side guacamole on tap too is a definite bonus.  He'll make it spicy too!  I like that.",

Our biggest trouble is finding a place that gives me enough food cause I eat roughly 4000-5000 calories a day so needless to say when I go out to eat I want ALOT of food.   I don't know how they stay in business because the prices are super cheap and they give you an ENORMOUS plate of food, and unlimited chips that they make themselves. I always get the Cheese Dip and these chips are amazing because they are about as sodium free as i've ever tried (anyone know how to make these tortilla chips from scratch?)  My entree is always Carnitas De Res...i love it so why take a chance on something else? I look forward to this everytime we go....You get tons of beans and rice but that sauce on the beef w/ this dish makes the plate.  Between my girl and I plus the cheese dip appetizer and tea's our meal is still always in the $20's and she will have leftovers. This is the best bang for your buck in Charlotte.  Atmosphere when we go (typically late) is generally very quiet and relaxed except every Saturday night they'll have a live band going.....we prefer the quiet time to relax and talk but if you want some entertainment with your dinner go on a saturday night.",

Upon arriving I was seated and unlike most Mexican restaurants, who bring chips and salsa immediately, I waited over ten minutes for the chips to arrive & place my drink order. I also chose to order the cheese dip w/ jalapenos! The chips were was cold & stale, blah. I asked for a fresh batch when the cheese dip arrived and the 2nd batch were the exact same. Unfortunately the cheese dip had no flavor, was cold, and the jalapenos were obsolete. On to the meal...I chose a chicken burrito & ground beef taco. Both had NO flavor. Everything was so bland I added salt to everything. The service was just as disappointing, as I had to ask for a refill b/c I could not find my waiter, even though there seemed to be about 10 employees just standing around. Overall, there are too many other great Mexican restaurants. So disappointed, as I had hoped to really enjoy it.",

    "text": "I don't know what's wrong with me but I truly just have not found a Mexican restaurant in Charlotte that wows me. Maybe I'm not that big of a fan of it and just never realized that. I mean I thought I really liked it. Don Pedro's did nothing to make me stand up and say wow.  The biggest plus for them was they had decent prices and the ambiance inside reminded me of Cancun.  Our waiter definitely didn't want to be there much less waiting on us at lunch. He kind of had an attitude the whole time, but the manager who checked in on us was very  nice and he was working hard so kudos to him!!  On to the food... we started with some salsa and queso, and the queso was the runniest cheese I have ever eaten. I've made better queso at home and I'm still trying to perfect that recipe into something I love. Honestly every other place I've gotten queso it starts to thicken up over time as cheese does when it gets cooler. Not this stuff, this stuff just would run off your chip like it was water almost. Just wasn't good at all. The salsa was decent standard fare but it lacked any kind of heat.  I ordered the chicken carnitas and to be honest the chicken and the sauce/veggies it was with was pretty good. The best thing I had here honestly and so for that they get 3 stars.  The rice was dry and the beans tasted like they came from a can, but the flour tortillas were warm and not bad even though I highly doubted they were hand made or anything.    Is this a place I will visit again?? Well it will never be my suggestion, nor will I remember this place to revisit however if my co-worker suggested it again then I wouldn't say no.  So it's just okay in my book.",

The margarita was a decent size but terrible. Tasted like generic sweet & sour over lots of ice. Didn't taste or feel any tequila. Then we decided to try the chicken jalepeno nachos. That's regular nachos but more expensive because they add canned jalepenos. The nachos were so bad. Chewy clumps of shredded cheese over a small amount of  chips, very dry chicken, tomatoes, guac and sour. Oh yeah and I think I saw a smear of beans in there. Anyway, we were so extremely unsatisfied, and regretful. Then comes the bill. The nasty margaritas were $8.25. $30 bill for two ritas and some rauchy nachos. But, on a positive note...the service was decent. They were very friendly and served us all the crap with a smile. Unfortunately Don Pedro, that wasn't enough to bring me back.",

This is an old standby for us, as it's close by and they have a good health score. At times they have people going around with carts, making items at your table. I love it when they have the fresh guacamole: they know how to spice it perfectly and you can get it with additional fresh garlic or hot peppers if you like. It's served in the volcanic pestle bowl they make it in. The other cart they have sometimes is fresh citrus margaritas, where they squeeze the limes at your table. Portions here are huge, so we always have enough to take home. I love the fajita salad. My husband usually has the Texcana Fajitas, which has a mixture of beef, chicken and shrimp with onions and peppers. It comes with tortillas, refried beans, yellow rice, sour cream and guacamole. The other meal I really enjoy is the Steak Rey, which has a glorious cactus salad as part of the plate. (I wish some of these places would have black beans instead of the refried.) I usually come for supper when I have plenty of time to socialize, so I can enjoy taking my time then. If I am going to pay for a meal, I want to allow myself time to savor each bite. This probably isn't a good place if you need to eat and run. And if you really want to embarrass someone, bring them here for their birthday. They will put a huge sombrero on their head and sing to them with a guitar :)",

Even the refried beans tasted freshly home made.  The waiter even brought out a slice of fried tortilla with syrup and whipped cream which was a nice touch at meal's end.

I waited an excessive amount of time for my food which was quite disappointing.  When the food finally arrived it was flavorful but a bit dry.  I had to moisten both the burrito and the rice with the salsa.  The refried beans were actually good but a bit hot in temperature.  I think Don Pedro's is worth a second chance.  Except for the dryness of the burrito and the initial service issues, the food had great flavors.",

We got excited when we seen it was a family restaurant of Azteca, which we love. Services was good and the waiter was very friendly.   But the food was just so so, nothing great nothing bad. All and all not a bad dinner but we will probley try somewhere else when we are in the mood for Mexican.",

This is my second time here and both times service was excellent and food was wonderful. I will say though that their portions are shareable. There is no way I could possibly eat even a third of what they served. Of course being a previous restaurant owner I'm screaming \"food cost\". Highly recommend!!",

The melted cheese on top was hard cold and rubbery the chili rellano was cold and soggy but they pored sauce on top that was hot to cover up the cold pepper. I got skirt steak that was burnt I wouldn't feed it to my dog. It was like dried out flavorless beef jerky. I had them remove mine from the check. I told the manager about the cold food. His response was \" our food is hot when it's first cooked but if the servers don't pick it up right away it will get cold under the light that's why the plates are so hot\" I said \"and that's ok with you\". I'm not interested in a hot plate I'm interested in hot food.  Will never go back!! Next time we will Waite patiently the hour and a half at Los Aztecas on 521 in Indian Land. Now that place is delicious.  Which is probably why there was a long Waite on a Friday night and Don Pedro was like a ghost town.",

    "text": "Decided to grab Mexican food for a late lunch (3 pm on a Sunday) while we were out shopping and decided on Don Pedro between 4-5 different options within a couple of miles. It was a first time for both of us and everything we experienced was above and beyond our expectations!   First the place was packed, which we took as a good sign, and there were waitstaff buzzing all over the place so even amidst the rush everyone seemed to be very well taken care of. Each table gets 2 free baskets of chips/salsa but then for the 3rd or more you pay $2-3. We didn't want/need any more chips than we got but I can see this being a turn off for larger parties that may really power through multiple baskets.  We were each going to get a margarita and our server told us about their giant sized one which is basically served in a fishbowl. We think it was easily 3-4 regular sized drinks in one huge glass. We got the frozen lime and it was SO GOOD! Perfectly creamy, flavored and frothy! Seriously, I don't know what it was about it but the margarita had a creaminess to it like a pina colada and we were definitely not complaining! It was delicious and so much better than having icy bits and chunks blended in.   Meal wise one of us got the Chimichanga and the other got a steak burrito. Both were paired with rice and beans (refried or black) and were served on HUGE plates with plentiful servings. It was honestly so much food that between snacking on chips and sipping our margaritas we both ended up taking nearly half of our food home.   One REALLY COOL thing to look out for at this restaurant is their guacamole cart that rolls around to your tableside and they make fresh guac right there in front of you! There are two different size options and they can kind of customize it for you, too. Super cool to watch them make it from scratch.  One last thing of note is that this restaurant has a very large interior and plentiful parking... perfect for large groups of people! They have large corner booths but also really long banquet tables. Other than their bar area the place is pretty open, so you lack the privacy of a back room, but there is definitely plenty of room to host a large and social dinner party!   Actually one last LAST thing is that we learned right as we were leaving that late night they turn into a mariachi club of sorts between 10 pm- 2 am!",

I could literally drink salsa, and their salsas are no exception. From their mild, to hot, to their salsa verde...they are all fresh and delicious. Their tortilla chips are a little thicker than others you'd get at a Mexican restaurant, and every time I've been there, they have been served warm. What's not to love?  The one thing I really like about Don Pedro is that you get a ton of food for your money. Portion sizes are huge! This place is super generous, and I love that my dollar goes farther here.  Finally, at the end of your meal you're given warm sopapillas with whipped cream, and some other type of magic drizzled on it. Those things are addictive, and one part of my meal I always look forward to!  I have no complaints about Don Pedro! Stellar food!",

Next I ordered the guacamole and a few moments later, a guy with a cart showed up and he makes the guacamole fresh, in front of you, to your taste (jalapenos,  lime, etc.), so that was awesome as well. I ordered the Fajitas Texacanas. OMG, that is a mountain of food. Steak, chicken and shrimp with fresh veggies served piping hot...and quite the heap of food as well. It was very delicious.

Here's what happens:  My glass was broken in 2 places.  The tacos were over salted - couldn't even eat it.  The beans and rice were good.  So I ate beans & rice with nothing to drink cause the waitress never came to check on me.  When she finally showed up I explained the situation.  I paid for beans and rice . My take away - this restaurant in my opinion is horrible.  Food is horrible service was horrible and dishes were broken.  I will NOT ever be back.  So sorry.  Grade F.  The end Adios",

Tonight I ordered the Avocado Tostada , with refried beans and rice huge plate of food. The fresh cut avocado is perfect with the Chicken , beans an Rice. My favorite end to the meal the rasberry tortilla you get with check yum . They have a few locations Pineville an one off South Tryon , great wait staff . Stop in for their lunch specials an great to stop an get a taco salad an you get a bag of chips with it great salsa .",

    "text": "This place has decent lunch pricing.  The chunky salsa has a kick.  They only use yellow cheese on most plates, so that's a bit disappointing.  I love cheese but picked a lot off of each item on my plate.  The Chile Relleno was pretty different than anything I've had before, not saying it was bad, just different.  This is always my litmus test for any random Mexican restaurant.  Basically there was one strip of pepper around ground beef, wrapped in an \"egg batter\"... it pretty much had an omelette-ish texture.  Very egg heavy and needed lots more chile  and more sauce.  It did come with a huge scoop of guacamole YUM!  Personally I'm not a huge fan of eggs in Mexican cuisine, but if that's your jam then this might be an awesome choice for you.  Not bad like I said, just a different twist on my favorite dish.  Service was really good with lots of refills on salsa and waters.  A free little dessert is a nice touch. Everyone at the table got a cinnamon sugar fried tortilla slice with whipped cream and strawberry syrup.",

    "text": "Don Pedro used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. My last visit was not good, however. I should have known it was going to be bad when our waiter took our drink order then disappeared for a while. He also disappeared for a while a couple of other times. They were not that busy so I'm not sure where he disappeared to. The chips were warm but the salsas they brought were uninspiring. I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas and my friend ordered carnitas authentic tacos. My food was lukewarm at best and the shredded beef (picadillo) was very tough to the point that I had trouble eating it with just a fork. I informed my waiter that the food was cold. He looked at me and asked me what I wanted to do. I replied that \"I want hot food.\" My friend's tacos were not good either. The Carnitas didn't have as much flavor as I expected and didn't have the crunch of nicely done Carnitas either. We ordered margaritas with our meal. The standard margarita was OK but wasn't cheap at more than eight dollars each. The top shelf margarita tasted like it didn't have any sour mix in it so it was way too sweet! The waiter said it was because of the Grand Marnier. I've had margaritas with Grand Marnier plenty of times and they were good. This one was not. Instead of sending it back we ordered another standard margarita and mixed the two which made it much better.  I've always enjoyed going to Don Pedro in the past but after this visit I most likely will not ever go back again. I wonder what happened to them? Maybe a change in ownership/management?",

Like most Mexican restaurants, they'll start you out with complimentary chips and salsa. That can be dangerous, but oh so delicious at the same time.  Most of the staff is helpful and friendly. Ask for Kevin! He goes above and beyond to make your visit exceptional!  I was disappointed with my last visit and the Mexican stir fry I ordered, it definitely wasn't as good as the first time I picked - several months earlier. It's ok. Things happen, and I have had several other great things from Don and his staff. That won't deter me from returning.  Saturday nights can get a little loud with a live mariachi band making the rounds as well as other music they may be playing to salute folks celebrating a cumpleanos. (That's Spanish for birthday! C'mon people.. look it up!)  When you are finished eating and ready to settle your tab, they will top off your tummy with complimentary sweet dessert tortilla chips! Yum!",

Don Pedro is large with lots of tables and plenty of servers who keep moving and keeping up with your orders.  Drinks are excellent.  Good portions and well-made.  Wife especially likes the coconut margarita and I find that their regular margaritas just fine for me.  Their guacamole is not the pureed stuff you get pre-packaged or in lesser restaurants.  Don Pedro's guac is fresh, chunky, mildly onion, lemon kissed and with some hot sauce or salsa is even better.  Put that in your mouth and eat it!  The menu has the standard USA version of Mexican favorites:  burritos, tacos, tostadas, pork carnitas and meats in mostly tomato sauces.  Portions are great, hence you see a lot of teenager boys and families eating a lot for less.  Service is excellent.  Absolutely accommodating and they are eager to have you like the place, drinks and foods.  Prices very reasonable and they have their own parking area as part of a large shopping center.",

Service was slow and the food at best was tasteless.  The chips and salsa were terrible.  The chips tasted as if they were made in week-old oil and the salsa had a strange after taste.  We ordered a medium-well steak and a taco salad.  The steak was served nearly raw.  The taco salad was served with a tough and tasteless beef picadello with some shredded lettuce and a few pieces of cheese on top of it. It was sitting in a plateful of some liquid that completely soaked the taco shell the salad was in. Neither of us were able to eat what will be our meals there.",

    "text": "This place is gross. I've been a few times with coworkers that love it, and have been disappointed every time. Every meal I've had has obviously been nuked in the microwave, with my most recent experience looking like they had accidentally put the pico on the plate BEFORE sticking it in the microwave, so it came out a steaming pile of tomato-ish sauce. If you do happen to do go this place, get something that has either been grilled or cooked fajita style...that's the only way you will be eating something that you'll know is relatively fresh.",
