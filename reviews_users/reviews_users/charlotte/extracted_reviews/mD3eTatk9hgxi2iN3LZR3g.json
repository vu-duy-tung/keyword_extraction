    "text": "I was so very excited to try some good eats from this Japanese-Filipino style restaurant. I went on a Sunday when they offer their Filipino Brunch! I ordered Beef Estofado and Sotanghon Guisado. The flavors were good but a bit on the bland side compared to the authentic Filipino dishes I've eaten both abroad in the Philippines and stateside in Washington DC. The beef tasted vey similar to a traditional American crockpot-made beef stew. The noodle dish (Sotanghon Guisad) tastes like plain noodles with a hint of garlic and sesame oil. One of my closest friends is a Filipino chef and resides in Manila Philippines so I've been afforded the opportunity to taste many authentic Filipino dishes (street food and restaurant food) with flavors that are so rich and well crafted they leave your mouth waters days later just thinking about it! So to be completely honest I was left underwhelmed and would give those two dishes a 3.5 on a 5point scale.  I also took advantage of the buy one get one half-off sushi deal. I ordered the Khaleesi Roll & Spicy Scallop Roll. Hands down one of the best sushi experiences in the university area that I've had. The sushi tasted fantastic and the speciality rolls are unique, bursting with intense flavor, and fresh!  The sushi is definitely a 4.0 on my 5point scale. All in all this place is mostly know for hibachi which I have yet to try. I am planning a second visit just for hibachi. So far I'm a fan of the sushi but could leave the Filipino dishes on the table.",

    "text": "Funny tip that perhaps nobody really needs:  After parking, do not walk into the first door you see underneath the store's sign.   Unless of course, you want Cold Stone ice cream.  Yea I was distracted by my excitement to try this place and missed the signs on the sidewalk that I should have followed to the other side of the building for the real Bachi entrance.  I actually called the restaurant asking where they were located and they explained this to me (hey it was dark, we all make mistakes J).    Vegan options- Absolutely awesome! They make it easy by even separating these.   The cauliflower wings - give me a platter please.  So much flavor (perhaps because they marinate the cauliflower) and the perfect crunch with vegan ranch.  Hold on while I wipe my drool.  Ok I'm back.  I had one of the creative sushi rolls - King Liam - which had plantains, vegan cream cheese and cucumbers.  So much more flavor and texture than some of the places where vegetarians and vegans are limited to avocado rolls.  As if this wasn't enough food, the fatboy in me wanted to try the vegetarian meal (ask them to make it vegan and they happily oblige).  This came with fried rice, garlic noodles, mixed veg and a salad.  The best part of the food coma was that when you come out of it, there is zero regret.  I wish this place were closer to me but will definitely get up here any free weekend I have.  Great service, great food and a gem for people with dietary restrictions.",

Look for signs, it's tucked away behind Cold Stone. Sat beside a young man who is Filipino who offered some recommendations: the lumpia, crispy pork belly and pork bbq for apps. He also recommended the chicken Adobe. We will have to try next time because we had an eye on the sushi which is currently buy one get one 50%. It was wonderful! Very fresh and comparatively priced. Decent variety. Knocked a star down because would like to see more Filipino dishes, but we heard that the owner is working to work more foods in once customers become more comfortable with trying a newer food. Lastly I will mention no problem with parking and child friendly. They have We'll be back.",

If you call in an order they make you give them your card number over the phone. Very inconvenient to pull out my card and just feels funny verbally telling someone my card number. I do not eat here as much as a result of this annoying policy. Also, sometimes the food is ready when I get there. Other times I am told 10 - 15 minutes and it ended up taking 30 minutes.",

Bachi appeared in several places that I searched, they are pretty new, so I decided to give them a try. When I walked in I was greeted immediately and given a menu. We ordered the Steak & Shrimp as well as the Steak & Scallops togo. The wait wasn't too long. Maybe about 10-15 minutes and my order was ready. A waitress also offered us water as we waited. First thing that turned me off from them is that they do not offer the Japanese Mustard sauce. This isn't a big deal though as I find it hard to find, but with this I knew they wouldn't be my goto. They nickel and dime you with the sauces! One little 2oz container of White Sauce and then 50 cent for any additional sauces. That was pretty annoying. The food was good though. It had a good hit of flavor. My only complaints are that they are definitely skimpy on the veggies, the zucchini was cut way too big, and my scallops were overcooked and small. Though I was able to finish my plate and be satisfied, i'm still on the search for a fav!!",

A family own quaint, but vibrantly decorated restaurant, Bachi focuses its attention on traditional, and incredible, Filipino cuisine.  They also carry an extensive and extravagant sushi menu.  One of the managing partners, Basilio, was kind enough to walk us through the menu extensively, answer all our questions of wonderment.  Truly delicious and truly hospitable Bachi has perfected a much needed spin on habachi.",

I heard about the opening day of this place and was highly upset on the special I missed. Either way I came in on an empty stomach and knew I was going to give this a full try of multiple different things on the menu. I ordered the baked mussels, hibachi scallop dinner, the pua roll( vegetarian option), and the uhh it's 10:30 roll. First thing that grabbed my attention was all the creative sushi roll names (I am sucker for clever sayings). The next thing that grabbed my attention was the server at the register. She was extremely upbeat and very welcoming. When it comes to the food, I can say this place doesn't hold back. I am pescatarian and of course love good quality seafood. The mussels were a decent size and full of flavor as were the scallops on my hibachi dinner. My rolls weren't labeled which was exciting to me because I wanted to see if I could taste the difference between the vegetarian roll and salmon roll. Other than the True texture of the fish, the veggie roll tasted just as good. I really like this place and hopes it lasts, the area it's in is kind of congested with hibachi places but this one is one of quality I will say.",

Pretty good, but never blowing me out of the water with flavor, hence the need for shrimp sauce on a consistent basis. I was pleasantly surprised!! The ingredients were fresher than I expected and the dish was full of flavor. The prices are reasonable and they also serve sushi that tastes amazing! We ordered on a Wednesday and they have BOGO 1/2 off sushi rolls. I wasn't able to assess the environment of the restaurant or the customer service because this meal was carry out but my husband mentioned that the staff was friendly. I was so pleased that I considered going back a few days later! Try it and see for yourself!",

It was very clean and bright, but awfully loud!  The extra tall ceilings made everything echo.  As for the food, my edamame was good, but it was served with my lunch instead of an appetizer.  I did like that they served a salad, noodles and rice with my meal.  Sometimes it is really hard for me to chose between rice and noodles so I was pumped to have both.  My hibachi chicken was a tad dry which made me kick myself for not ordering just veggies instead.  I don't think I will be back despite being able to walk there from my job.  I would opt to drive to Toyama or TinTin for sure.  They are just better.",

The best attributes they have is that they are affordable and offer vegan sushi which I'm not sure if other places have options like that. I ordered the empanadas, spicy scallop roll, and caliente roll. All items were decent, but once again, not great. The sushi rolls were very small from what I'm used to, but had pretty good flavor. I would not order the empanadas again. They were listed as pork empanadas, so it was very shocking when I bit into it and it had an overwhelming sweet taste. Definitely not what you expect when ordering a savory dish. The dough was sweet and it had raisins inside which is not a smart move. Compared to the sushi rolls at Tin Tin right down the street from here, Bachi is lacking. I probably won't come back, but it wasn't a bad one-timer.",

We had FULL portions even took some home (messed up my plans to get ice cream after I was so full).   I'm going back, I did not try the sushi so I need to when I do. The pricing is like normal hibachi but you get rice, noodles and all veggies not like other places where you have to choose only 2 or 3 sides. So for both meals it was around $30. The atmosphere was cool as well and everyone was so nice and welcoming!! I'm coming back baby!",

They have a mixture of Filipino food, hibachi, and sushi at decent prices. I can't speak for authenticity but the sushi was delicious. They were fresh and preparation was quick. The rice to filling ratio was a great potion, so I was not complaining. They also had B1G1 1/2 off (Sundays) so the price wasn't too bad.   Overall, my meal and my friends' were delicious.

I wanted to secure dinner before I went to the gym (don't judge) so I ordered to-go hibachi (chicken & shrimp). The price came to about $16 and it came with plenty of vegetables and noodles. It took about 7 minutes for my order to be made and handed to me... not bad considering all the food that came on the plate. Once I got it home, it literally looked like I'd just left a hibachi restaurant. The taste was AMAZING! So why did they lose a star? The to-go box that my food came in wasn't the best container to hold hot food with hibachi juice. The container became soft and I had hibachi juice on my counter, so I had to transfer it all to plate until I was able to enjoy after the gym.   Because they have other Filipino options and sushi, I will definitely be going back. This time, I will more than likely eat in. Nonetheless, I'm excited for this gem to join the Mallard Creek/Prosperity area.",

I also really enjoy that they have a sushi bar to sit at if you're coming in solo.  I've been here 3 times in 1 week, which speaks volumes! I definitely will recommend Bachi to anyone wanting express hibachi.",

They also offer a specialty Filipino dish during brunch on Sunday's and they list it on their Instagram page.  I've yet to try the sushi, so that may be my next thing to try.  The hibachi was inconsistent for me, on one visit it was pretty good and on another it seemed to lack something.  The meals come with a salad, but the ginger dressing was super watery every time I've tried it.  The veggie gyoza's were pretty good and the lumpia shanghai was very good.  I will say that the highlight for me was the Filipino dessert, Turon with vanilla ice cream, which is wrapped plantains fried and served with ice cream....the best and most memorable item I've had since visiting.  I do plan to visit during brunch to try more of the Filipino items, but so far it has just been ok for me.",

I called ahead of time to see if they had gluten free options (which they do) and was happy to hear their all of the hibachi items are gluten free. I ordered and specifically said gluten free and it didn't seem like a problem. They brought us out salads that looked good but I wasn't sure about the dressing being gluten free so I asked and she confidently said it was gluten free. I'm about half way through when another person came up to me and told me that it was in fact NOT gluten free. I have an allergy so I immediately stop eating it and tell them..all they did was offer me a salad with a different dressing...the food was good but I will not be returning. I'm already sick from eating the gluten and extremely disappointed in how the entire situation was handled.",

For starters, the first time I had the calamari, which was very well seasoned and came with a sweet dipping sauce. Second visit, I had the lumpia. And the pork was so flavorful and the rolls were so crispy. Def would get both again. My friends ordered several orders of the cauliflower wings and loved them; although I didn't try them.  For the entree, I had a hibachi combo plate of NY strip & shrimp. They give you fried rice, garlic noodles and veggies all for like $14. Unbelievable deal.  The staff were super friendly and helpful in making menu decisions. Will definitely be back and looking forward to a South side location *cough cough* LOL",

My partner and I went on a weekend night, close to close so it wasn't super busy.  We were deaddd after a 14 hour drive to Charlotte from the Northeast, but we needed some food.  We celebrated the end of the long trip with a couple beers and shared cauliflower wings, a sushi roll (I forgot the name), and a chicken hibachi plate.  The cauliflower wings were VERY good.  They were perfectly cooked, a little on the firmer side, with a good crust.  The vegan dip was excellent - very thick like an aioli and nicely spiced.  I could have eaten a whole cauliflower prepared like that.  The sushi roll had spicy tuna, cream cheese, broiled fish, and crunchies.  I was pleased that the spicy tuna was actually spicy by itself as opposed to a ton of a spicy mayo.  Pretty good with the charbroiled flavors.  The chicken combo plate was where things were just kind of ok.  The chicken, garlic noodles, and fried rice were kind of bland which was really disappointing for hibachi.  There was some \"shrimp sauce\" but I never really like drenching food in sauces - the food should be standalone.  The sauteed veggies were actually pretty good on the plate hah!  Service was good and 2 out of 3 dishes were enjoyable so I'd come back to try some of their other sushi and other small plates.",

    "text": "I heard great thing about Bachi and have wanted to find some authentic Filipino food in the Charlotte area. Since I was in the area I planned to have lunch here.   We got to the restaurant right before the lunch rush. I was a little taken a back by the lack of clean tables when we got there. Since the restaurant had just opened and the staff was chatting and playing on their phones when we got there I didn't expect for there to salt and debris all over the tables. No one ever wiped the tables off either.   We ordered the Chicken  and Shrimp hibachi style dinner and the Lola's Lumpia Shanghai appetizer. I knew that Lumpia was a Filipino dish but felt like the Chicken and Shrimp dish was more Japanese style dish.  The two were a lot of food for my mom and myself to share. We forced ourselves to finish the dinner plate and brought the Lumpia home to eat later. Yes it does seem like we should have eaten the fried dish first and brought home the other items to reheat later but the Lumpia came out after the other dish and was fresh out the grease and unable to consume until it cooled off. I would have to say they were fine to snack on at room temperature.   The Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi comes with both rice and noodles and hibachi veggies. There was also a side of shrimp sauce for the plate. The items were cooked well and not burned. The Lumpia really didn't have much flavor for me. Nothing stood out to me.   I like the concept of Bachi and I think they try but overall I wasn't impressed. I would never drive back to the Mallard Creek area to go here.

You can't really call it a Filipino restaurant as its more of a Japanese restaurant with a few Filipino items on the menu. However, the Sunday is the best time to get the best Filipino experience with their brunch special.  We started off with the Pinoy Lumpia and the B1G1 half off sushi. For the entree, I got the brunch special of chicken Adobo and Sotanghon Guisado. The lumpia and chicken were my favorites, delicious and packed with flavor. The sushi was fresh and some of the best in the university area. I was not the biggest fan of the guisado, it seemed to lack something. All I got was the taste of sesame.   I was pleased with the Filipino spread we had and look forward to trying other items on their menu.",

The scallops were cooked perfect and the beef tataki was very yummy. I wish they had a larger sushi selection though. A lot of them were fried and not very memorable. The staff was nothing short of courteous and attentive.",

    "text": "After two of my Yelp friends recommended this place, I had to check it out for myself. I went on a Friday evening within an hour of closing. It wasn't busy at all. I ordered a chicken, and a shrimp hibachi meal. I had them give me extra noodles to replace the veggies for the chicken since it was for my son.  The chicken was so juicy and fresh. My son LOVED his meal. He yelled it from the other room. My meal with the shrimp was also very good. I would recommend getting an extra ginger dressing though. I could've used more, but that's just me.  I also ordered two of the vegan rolls: King Liam and Pua. They were both very good as well. As with regular sushi rolls, they gave me fresh ginger and wasabi. I can't say that it needs it. I liked them both with and without the wasabi and ginger.   I would definitely go back, as I live very close to this place. I suggest you give this place a try. Next time I'll likely try a couple of the regular sushi rolls. And right now they are running a special, BOGO 50% off.",

    "text": "Slam dunk awesome hibachi and sushi. Pack it up boys, this review is over!  ... OK maybe I have a bit more to say, but the main takeaway from this review should be to put this place on your go-to list. I had a friend tell me about Bachi last night and the thought of crispy pork belly was too much to resist. Lunch plans for Sunday were set in stone. When we arrived, I wasn't sure what to expect as far as service style. Pleased to say that it's full service wait staff that seats you and takes your order. They have inside, outside, and sushi bar seating. Decor is minimalist and modern, very clean design. They have a handful of TV's around that of course on Sunday afternoon was showing NFL, I like it!  You know what the best part about my wife joining me for lunch? Splitting plates! We ended up getting an entree, a small plate, and two sushi rolls. First thing to arrive to the table was the Crispy Pork Belly dish. The pork belly had an amazing crust and cut thick. Just the right amount of fat-to-meat ratio. The dipping sauce was either ponzu or something similar. Bright and full of strong citrus flavor. Perfect start, at $9 its a steal.  For the entree we ordered the Hibachi NY Strip and Salmon Combo. Both proteins were delicious, great medium-rare on the strip and a moist petite cut of salmon. Veggies are almost universally too tender when cooked at a hibachi grill, but these veggies were treated very well and stood out on their own very nicely. The fried rice was absolutely perfect, and made me realize that this restaurant was like all the parts of my favorite Asian cuisine wrapped into one l experience.  For our rolls we chose a simple Salmon Maki-style roll and also a salmon skin roll. The simple roll was great, not to say that's easy. Maki rolls require high quality fish to stand out and this one really does! I've never had a salmon skin roll and quickly found that the texture is the key. They fry the salmon skin and it l compliments the veggies in the roll very well, while still giving the roll a good salmon flavor.  I can't wait to explore the Filipino dishes next time. This place hit all the high marks for me and it's great to see the new kid in this older shopping center thriving. A genuinely wonderful find!",

We were greeted upon entering and seated right away.  The space is a decent size, not too big. It's clean, bright, and open. Plenty of indoor seating and a few umbrella tables outside. In addition to a few Filipino dishes, Bachi also serves Hibachi style entrees, sushi, and other Japanese-inspired dishes. They also offer vegan options.  We tried the following: Caterpillar Roll $9.00 Miso Soup $2 Pork BBQ $8 Scallop Meal $11 Halo Halo $7 Ube Coconut Shake $5  The food is pretty authentic! The pork bbq, halo halo, and ube coconut shake tasted just like how I remembered them in the Philippines. Delicious! The sushi, soup, and scallop meal were also pretty good. Prices are very reasonable for the portions. Definitely worth a try!",

It can pretty much be made into two meals. I'm not too keen on noodles so I did not try them either time, but everything else was great.   Staff seems pleasant and service was fast. Pricing seems very reasonable for quality and amount if food. Both times I ordered take-out. I like the clean simplisticity of the decor so I definitely plan to dine in soon, perhaps to try the sushi!",

    "text": "Listen I'm going to be over critical for sure. But i know what Filipino food should taste like. And if i could give 3.5 stars I would but I can't - so 3 it is.   I came here strictly for the Filipino food. It was actually the halo halo that I came here for.   We ordered the following items:   Kids meal - chicken with noodles. It's a super small amount of chicken just cut up into several small pieces. It's probably about 2-3oz worth of chicken. The noodles are just spaghetti noodles that are seasoned with spices and soy sauce. Not bad actually. The chicken breast a little dry and the veggies were a good assortment.   Crispy Cauliflower Wing - the first bite I was like what the ? But it actually grew on me and I enjoyed it. It has a crispy, slightly chewy batter that is sweet and tangy. The inside is soft and juicy.   Lola's Lumpia Shanghai - I love that it comes with 8 pieces. Not stingy at all. But they are petite. Most lumpia is thin so this is expected. It wasn't bad at all. I mean I'm particular to mine and my mom's but for eating out. I was pleasantly surprised.   Crispy Pork Belly - this was hands down the best thing we ordered. It was cooked perfectly and delicious. But... I asked for fish sauce and vinegar. They did have vinegar, no fish sauce. I told my man - the sever would probably look at me crazy if I asked for some Tomas Mang (all purpose sauce) (my other Filipinos will know what I'm talking about).  While this isn't a \"Filipino\" restaurant- I think if you're going to serve Filipino food why not have the accompaniments that normally go along with a dish. And any Pinoy will you tell they eat their pork belly with either Tomas mang or Paris (fish sauce) & vinegar.   Pork BBQ skewers - I would strongly suggest telling everyone to pass on this. And it's not because of the piece of hair embedded in one of our sticks. But it's just not authentic Filipino bbq and it was tough. And the glaze on it was just okay.   Halo Halo - it's pronounced hallow-hallow NOT Hey-low Hey-low. My server tried to correct me and pronounce it that way. I just smiled. They serve theirs in a Sunday Glass and it has most the components you would find in a traditional halo halo. Shaved ice, beans, jelly, flan, ube ice cream & more. It's not your typical American dessert so it's not super sweet but for me - it's something I grew up on and is near and dear to my heart. And listen to have the option to even get halo halo in Charlotte is extremely exciting to me. So I'll definitely be back just for this.   Overall, I would definitely return. The other food looks amazing and honestly what we had for the most part was pretty okay.   I'm just excited to see Filipino food in the Charlotte scene.",

    "text": "Coming from San Diego, it's hard to find good Asian food here.  Although you would never find a Japanese/Filipino combination together in the same restaurant in CA, Bachi is really good.  I only found Bachi because I searched for \"lumpia\" on Yelp.  In San Diego everyone eats lumpia and there are plenty of Filipino places to find it.  Shanghai Lumpia is our favorite.  It's usually made with pork or beef and seasoning.  It's rolled tight like a cigar and made with a thin wrapper.  Bachi's lumpia didn't disappoint at all.  In fact, my husband (the lumpia connoisseur) thought these were better than the SD ones.  Whoa.. that's something.  He also had a couple of sushi rolls which he also enjoyed.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken Plate.  For only $8 it was served \"hibachi\" style with veggies, a scoop of fried rice, and garlic noodles.  The chicken was  breast and it was good quality.  I didn't encounter any pieces of fat or gristle in my whole dish.  That's something.  The garlic noodles were good too.    Service was good and friendly even though the place was pretty busy.  They are located on the street side of the shopping center behind Cold Stone.  And if you don't like this place, Bachi on you. Haha I'm Japanese and Bachi loosely translated means \"bad karma\".",

Bachi doesn't even have a spicy salmon roll on the menu. They ended up substituting salmon in their spicy tuna roll. Aside from being ~$3 more than the average price of a spicy salmon roll in the area, it wasn't that great. The sushi's consistency was kind of soggy, the salmon was warm, and there was no spicyness to it.   As far as the hibachi, I don't know why they even asked for how I wanted the steak cooked because it came very well done and tough even though I asked for medium. I ate the steak without any of the rest of stuff and I swear they didn't season it at all.  I wouldn't be so critical of them if it wasn't for the price. They are trying to be a premium restaurant by charging above market prices for both sushi and hibachi. I do not think that Bachi is as good as, much less any better than, a regular old hibachi restaurant down the street; and their charging you a premium.",

    "text": "I really hate that I had to give this restaurant a one star. Bachi was recommended to me by my Yelp Elite friends so I was expecting a great experience. Unfortunately, it was the complete opposite. I am eating a vegan diet at the moment and I was very pleased to see they had a vegan section on the menu. I ordered the fried cauliflower, a side salad, a side of veggies, and the King Liam sushi roll which was fried plantain, carrots, cucumber, vegan cream cheese, topped with a spicy vegan mayo. Those were the exact ingredients listed on the menu. When I got the sushi roll, I ate one piece of the sushi and immediately knew something was wrong. My throat started to itch and my tongue started to swell. I called the waitress over and told her I was having an allergic reaction and I needed to see the menu again. I wanted to ensure that I didn't over look any ingredients that were listed. Upon the review of the menu, I asked her to ask management what ingredients were in the vegan cream cheese and mayo. Come to find out the vegan mayo is based with tree nuts. I immediately panicked because I have a nut allergy. I am not deathly allergic, but I do have tongue swelling, throat itching, and an upset stomach whenever I come in contact with any kind of tree nut. I told the cook that it needs to state on the menu that this menu item contains tree nuts because there are a lot of people that have a tree nut allergy. I took and Allegra because that's all I had at the moment and the itching and swelling stop within 30 min. I finished the rest of my food items. When the check came I noticed that the sushi roll was still listed on my check. I asked the waitress why was it still on my check and I sent it back immediately after the first piece AND I experienced an allergic reaction. The waitress said that she would have to talk with the manager to see if they would take it off. The manager came out and spoke to me from behind the counter. I felt that was extremely rude. The least he could have done was come over to where we were seated. He then proceeded to say that I should have told them I have a nut allergy before ordering. I have never in my life been to a place that doesn't list nuts, or \"may contain tree nuts\" on menu items that indeed have nuts in them. Then he went and pulled the container of the vegan mayo and showed the ingredients. I'm still trying to figure out his reasoning for showing me a package that was in your kitchen that as a consumer I would of had no idea contained nuts. I flat out told him I wasn't paying $9 for a roll that I had one piece of and sent back because of their negligence. He then stated he thought I ate the whole roll. So clearly there's a lack of communication between you and your staff. I work for public health and I will definitely be contacting my colleagues in environmental health to address this issue. I have pictures of the menu and even took a to go menu to show that tree nuts aren't listed on their menu. Had I had a more severe reaction and had to go to the hospital this would of easily been a lawsuit. Despite the fact that I had this reaction, the way the situation was handled was subpar and way below standards. My friend enjoyed her food and thought it tasted good. However, the whole experience horrible.",

The service was fantastic, I had a lovey waitress that took care of me and made sure I was perfect the whole time. This is where I had to rate so low, I ordered some raw fish and I'm currently a sushi chef myself, the fish was a little warm and I knew I should've sent it back but went ahead and ate all the lovely nigiri I had ordered. Within 5 hours I was sick and vomiting, I didn't eat anything else but this and knew from the jump what it was. I hate putting any low review up but I was just dealt a bad card that's all, it's all in the business. Sadly I was just the small outlier. Thank you Bachi for a great experience I'm sorry that it ended this way",

Had the tempura vegetables, crispy cauliflower wings and vegan fried rice to go. The Tempura Vegetables was the best item of the three. It was crisp and light. Not oily. The dipping sauce was disgustingly sweet and I just discarded it. Cauliflower wings were just a tad too big in size, which created a soggy affect in the end. They lacked any flavor. However, the dipping sauce was nice. It really needed some spice to bring up a notch. I wonder if the wings would be better had I  experienced it right away? Nonetheless they were tasteless and soggy when I had them. The fried rice was just ok.  Overall my food lacked flavor. I do not see myself going back. It's a shame. Really was hoping to love this food since they consciously offer a vegan menu.  The staff was kind and attentive. Atmosphere is very casual and laid back. Meal was prepared quickly.",

Got the chicken/shrimp combination hibachi, and everything was delicious. Comes with small salad with ginger dressing, good portions of shrimp and chicken, helpings of both rice and garlic noodles, and mixed grilled vegetables (carrots, shrooms, broccoli, onions, zucchini). Perfectly seasoned, and not overly done with salt/garlic. Tastes just as good as more expensive, sit-down Japanese steakhouses. Two suggestions that would improve the experience from my particular point of view: (1) the portions are enormous. I'd probably be happier paying $2-$3 less for about 20% less food, and leave feeling more satisfied and less stuffed. (2) This place feels like a fast casual. But if you want to eat there, you are instructed to sit and be waited on (rather than just order, pay at the register, and take a number). So it's confusing as to whether you are expected to tip. Regardless of those two nit-picks...this one gets 5 stars, and I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I visited Bachi on a Saturday night around 6pm and was able to immediately be seated. This was my first time trying it. I got the chicken meal which comes with a salad, fried rice, garlic noodles, hibachi chicken, and veggies. The portions are amazing for what you're paying. My entire meal (I got water to drink) was like $8.58 and I took a fair amount of leftovers home with me. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for quick hibachi. Much better and higher quality than Toyama which used to be my go-to in the university area. The fried rice felt like it was missing something but was still good enough to eat. That's really the only critique I could give it.",

Then came the SMELL of horrific bleach and cleaning with mopping the floor, again right next to people eating!! Complained, and the waitress and owner could clearly not give a rats ass.  STAY AWAY from this place!",

The chicken was perfect, it was crispy and had the right amount of seasoning. It also came with rice and noodles, which is nice because you usually have to choose one or the other. It was really clean and the staff was super friendly. Will definitely be back and recommend it to others!",

Only comment I would make is that the prices seem high for the university area but then again prices are rising everywhere in CLT. Well done chefs.",

I cannot recommend enough for vegetarian and vegetarian/meat eating groups.",

I also tried a dessert.  Plantain wrapped like spring roll with ice cream and drizzled with Carmel sauce..I felt that the plantain was not cooked long enough. They were still quite hard. I also don't think they were ripe enough.  I suggest either par cook or let them ripen a little longer before flash frying them in the wrapper.  They did not cook long enough and was afraid that I might get sick. Other than that I'll def return. Hope you stay around for a long time! We need this in the area!",

Basically take it or leave it...loved the first time I came...wonderful lady...today they just dont care...guess that happens when u get \"popular\"... remember a horrible review travels faster than a good review...I'm a business owner as well",
