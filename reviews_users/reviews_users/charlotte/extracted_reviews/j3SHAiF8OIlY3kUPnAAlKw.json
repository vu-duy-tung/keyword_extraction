House of Leng is thee only Chinese place I have found in NC that makes brown fried rice, and the taste is a testimony to the difference between the two. I have ordered here twice now, and it has been great both times. I got orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, veggie chow fun, and some fried rice. All was very delicious, and reasonably priced with large portions. Their crab rangoons are lacking in size, and there is not enough filling, but other than that, this place is on the top of my list for go-to Chinese places.  Highly recommended.",

Whenever we get a mani/pedi, which we almost always do when I fly in for a visit, we usually do take-out at HoL before heading back to her home.  I'd probably rate today's visit 3- or 3.5 stars had my take-out order not taken more than the eight minutes I was told it would take for the wings to cook, which the guy even apologized would be the reason I'd have to wait a bit, and had I received the shrimp lo mein entree (for Mom) I'd asked for, rather than the shrimp lo mein combo that Mom found after we'd already arrived home.  (Btw, the wait for the order was around 25 minutes.)  Still, Mom and sis enjoyed the meal (the eggroll looked so delicious and had a very delectable-sounding crunch!), so three stars will do.  However, I wished I didn't have to suffer the blame for HoL staff getting the order wrong...",

    "text": "Ever since I moved to Charlotte from Chicago 2 years ago I've been looking for a good Chinese take out place.  Back home you could find one every couple of blocks and my absolute favorite is Wing Wah (Oh, how I miss you, cue the water works.)    I had tried a few places here and nothing came even close to my most cherished Wing Wah.  I'm used to fried rice being brown thanks to that yummy, salty soy sauce, not white like what I'd gotten here.  Fried rice should not be white!    After being let down so many times I just gave up on finding Chinese take out.  Then, one day I was informed of House of Leng.  I scoffed at the recommendation because my heart  nor my taste buds could take the potential disappointment.  However, one evening when the Chinese food craving bug kept biting me I decided to give House of Leng a try.  I ordered the Orange Chicken with fried rice.  Yes!  The rice was actually brown and tasty.  The chicken was okay just not my favorite.  Naturally I had mixed feelings but did at least have some place to go to if I just wanted fried rice.  A couple of days later my co-workers were going to House of Leng for lunch and invited me to go so I did.    Based on a recommendation, I ordered the Crispy Scallion Chicken with, you guessed it, fried rice.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  The chicken was delicious and went perfectly with the fried rice.  Portions were large yet I ate everything on my plate.  My co-workers all starred at me in shock because they are always teasing me about my picky eating habits.  Even better was that my meal was only $8 or $9.  Say What!?  I still miss Wing Wah, but the longing isn't as strong as it once was.  Finally, I've found my Chinese take out place in Charlotte!",

The waiter was very nice and helpful. (This also includes the whole staff!) Anyways, in short.. if you're craving for a quick chinese cuisine lunch, then this is the place to stop by!",

    "text": "Its kind of hard to differentiate the generic strip mall \"Chinese\" restaurants these days, but this one was a step above.  Decor was nice, the service was quick, and the food was good.  When I walked in I really liked the decor.  Tall ceilings, nice warm colors, and more of a restaurant feel than most places of this genre.  As soon as I walked in the door a man who looked like he owned the place, walked right up to us promptly to ask us how many.  As soon as we were seated we were asked what drinks we wanted.  This was for lunch so they had no problem getting us in and out quickly.  The food, AKA what really matters.  I had the general chicken, yes it was called general chicken, not general's or general tso's.  The sauce was a  little different than what I was thinking, but it was good.  There were some somewhat \"real\" Chinese dishes available, which I would like to try, but will save the for next time.  Most of the lunch dishes were either 5.79 or 6.99 and came with an eggroll/spring roll.  All in all, nothing amazing, but definitely edible, especially if you work in the area.  I won't go out of my way to eat there, but will definitely pay them a visit again.",

    "text": "I really don't ever eat Chinese food but we had a client lunch in the area so a co-worker and I decided to check this place out.  It was a casual/cafe type environment...it was clean, bright and packed with business professionals on their lunch hour.  Typically I picture take-out chinese to be rather grimy, dingy and where everything basically tastes like baked salt.  But, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and atmosphere especially since the prices were right!  You expect \"high end\" chinese to come in the form of a PF Changs but I'll tell you what...House of Leng was holding its own!!  The service was good, friendly and the food came out fast (not always a positive but my expectations were realistic).  I ordered the broccoli and chicken meal, with steamed white rice and it came with a springroll.  Everything was very tasty.  I won't say the sodium wasn't alive and well but the overall dish had great flavor and it was a nice portion.  It was even presented nicely on the plate.  The broccoli was fresh and bright green and the rice was nicely stacked on the plate.  The brown sauce the chicken and broccoli came in was thicker than \"normal\" so it was a pretty rich flavor.  The springroll was pretty basic...fried cabbage more or less.  It didn't have any other vegetables in it so it didn't make or break my experience.  Overall...I would say this place is a nice hidden gem.  It will certainly satisfy any chinese-food craving and exceed your expectations if you are not a typical \"take-out\" person.",

Nothing. We wait. I go up again! Finally after about 10/12 minutes his meal comes. I am done with mine. No offer to refill my tea. Waitstaff just zoom by our table until my husband grabs a waitperson as they are going by for boxes and the check.   The check is almost tossed on the table with a \"sorry for the delay.\" If there was anything less than a one star, this place would get it!  The food may be good--but the service left a lasting bad taste. We go often to this area. This will not be one of our stopovers--ever!",

Okay, so if you're not following my rant, there's another House of Leng not so far away near Boardwalk Billy's at University Pointe. I remember the first time I had the Crispy Scallion chicken there. It was awesome. So when my wife and I went to the one at Arbors on Mallard Creek Church Road, we were sure they would be the copy and the Crispy Scallion chicken would be less... awesome. But it was! We also enjoy ordering the Veggie Lo Mein. The two and the two of us met often.  And now we know how they Crispy Scallion chicken and the Veggie Lo Mein at both Houses of Leng are so good. It's made by the same guy. Or at least the same recipe. He often moves from one location to the other. In fact, some of the hall managers also switch locations. I guess it's a family run business. In any case, we had no problems with the food and just full stomachs. Ya, I'm a fan. Thanks, Mr. Leng. Or whoever he was.",

    "text": "Chinese food is one of those things that you don't eat a lot, and when you do, you look forward to it. I was extremely disappointed in what I ordered. A co-worker had suggested this place so I was curious to try it out. I ordered the sesame chicken, and general tso for my S/O, along with a side of spring rolls and crab rangoon. My dish had absolutely no flavor to it, there wasn't even really a sauce to it and definitely not crispy. My S/O dish also had no flavor, not spicy like usual. The spring rolls were mediocre (that's being generous) and the rangoons just had no flavor whatsoever.   Perhaps a different cook was here today, I'm not quite sure...and maybe their other dishes are better, but I won't be taking that gamble after this experience, especially considering the price (sesame chicken with brown rice, General tso side of fried rice, 3 springs rolls, order of crab rangoons and 2 20oz sprites = $42.77). I would've given this 0 stars if that was an option.   My suggestion, eat in if you decide to go here so that if its not to your desired liking, you can send it back...",

Now it's a high turnover nickel and dime place. No one stays. It's always a new waitstaff these days. I was shocked at the level of service here, especially when one of the older waitresses took back my check and hand wrote an extra 1.20 for rice. Never happened before. It's not the 1.20, it's the way she snarled back with the check making sure we saw we got charged for that extra bowl of rice we asked for. Horrible taste in our mouth.  My husband and I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or leave in disgust and frustration.",

I felt bad because the family wanted to eat at another local Chinese restaurant and I insist on this place which I thought was going to be REALLY GOOD. I was wrong. I haven't been here in a couple of yrs. It was really good back then.I don't know if they changed management but I will not be returning back. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli w/ garlic sauce and brown rice. Is it me but how come when I ask a Chinese restaurant for brown rice they think I'm talking about fried rice. NO!!! The rice was kind of hard and stale. The shrimp and garlic sauce was a bit on the salty side.   The rest of the food that the family ate was nothing to write about. You would think since it's conventionally located in a popular shopping plaza they would keep you coming back for more. Sorry house of Leng I'm no longer a fan. Where can I get some descent Chinese food in north Charlotte?",

So I stopped and got my usual take out order.  It's enough food to have probably 3 full meals.  It consists of:  steamed dumplings, garlic beef and Chinese donuts.  Here's where the laziness comes in, I usually get delivery from another place closer to my house, but I didn't want to wait...gut must have food NOW.  So I figured let's try House of Leng.    Firstly I believe I got gypped out of a egg roll.  Don't dinners always come with an egg roll?  2ndly, the price was about 5 bucks more than my usual place for LESS food.  Finally all of this being said I'd have been less pissed had the food actually been good.  but it wasn't.  Sigh...live and learn.  Next time the gut begs for Chinese food I'm just going to go with old faithful, even if it means I have to wait for delivery.",

We ordered the Peking Duck which was overwhelmingly salty, and it came with tortillas instead of pancakes. Tortillas!   I think they probably either ran out of the ingredients, or whoever made them was out that day since it took so long I think they ran to the store and bought them. Why turn down a perfectly good $30 order if you don;t have the ingredients? Just pile some slop on a plate and send it out. Any restaurant that would do that is not worth going to in my opinion.",

I ordered  a couple of dishes .. but the dish that forces me to write this review is their \"Honey Walnut Shrimp \" . My mom loves  the lightly battered shrimp coated with a creamy honey sauce and tossed with walnuts  which is how MOST  restaurants prepare this dish ( google Honey walnut shrimp and see for yourself ) .  Anywho back to this disaster I  received . This restaurant has the most DISGUSTING excuse for HWS and also has an incomplete description of the dish on the menu . Picked up my takeout and drove home , once my mother opened her dish , she sees soggy shrimp tossed in a bright orange/ red sauce with broccoli and red peppers and not a walnut in sight ...  think sweet and sour  shrimp , got me .. yeaa ewww . Definitely wasn't expecting that , so I call the restaurant back and explain  how the dish I have has red peppers in it and  no walnuts . The young male advised \"the back probably cooked the wrong dish and to bring it back\". I'm frustrated and starving since now  I have to hold off eating my food and  head back  but  I was also relieved  , like whew ! they made a mistake .. no way the \"from a can\" sweet Mumbo  sauce looking soggy shrimp with red peppers could be HWS. Boy was I wrong .. according to the super rude  , no sense of customer service   female Owner/night manager , this was the correct dish . She informed me that this was their  honey walnut shrimp , they just forgot to give me the  walnuts . No sorry or nada !  I inquired why does the dish have red peppers and the menu doesn't include this ? We don't eat red peppers and would not have ordered this dish otherwise ( points to menu description  that says (Lightly battered shrimp stir fried and topped with honey walnuts along with broccoli ). She had no response, and refused to refund me my 15$ dollars for the untouched food . After requesting 2x  for a refund ,  she  offered to make  another dish . At this point the whole experience  was just  leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Seemed like asking her for my money back was the equivalent of her giving me her arms and legs......lol ..  as a previous reviewer wrote  .. the customer service here is TERRIBLE..  Should have listened to my gut and not have  stopped at this place . Ultimately I picked something that nobody wanted to eat to just get out of the place  and received the difference of the price back . She never apologized  during the entire transaction . On a positive note though , she didn't have to give up  any limbs for  the refunded $ difference .",

I did not go back because during my first - and only visit until today - I asked for brown rice and they gave me white rice that was colored brown. I brought it to their attention and they told me that they basically fried white rice. I went again today, believing that after at least 8 years they would now be serving real brown rice. Nope!!! It's the same b.s. rice AND they have the unmitigated gall to charge $2.00 more! I had the scallion chicken - not good. I think I saw two scallion pieces in there. I asked for noodles and the woman said \"these are for soup only\" as she begrudgingly gave them to me. I promise.. I have learned my lesson. I will NEVER go back to House of Leng.",

We visited recently on a Saturday evening, and a ton of people were getting to-go food,  but many were eating in.  There's a large seating area with many tables.  This restaurant is located next to Jets Pizza in the Harris Teeter Plaza.  Lots of parking.  We didn't have to wait, sat right down.  Our appetizer arrived within about 5 minutes, with our main course to follow.  The egg drop soup was delicious, and the spring roll was pretty normal for this type of restaurant.  The Singapore noodles are AWESOME, and was served in a very generous portion for under $9.  Service is a little hit and miss, the servers seem to be balancing the to-go orders and the tables, so they aren't super attentive.  We had to wait awhile to get the bill and then pay.  Besides that, it's a great spot if you want this type of food and would like to sit down and enjoy!",

My husband had the chicken lo mein, which has chicken, carrots, broccoli, baby corn (my husband had it without the corn) and noodles.  I ordered the New-T Chicken which is breaded chicken that is lightly fried then sauteed with water chestnuts, mushrooms (I excluded the mushrooms), carrots and broccoli in a spicy brown sauce (I ordered mine not spicy).  Our food was very good. I really enjoyed the New-T Chicken. It came out hot (temperature wise) and it was very flavorful. I especially like the taste of the brown sauce which was just the way I ordered it, not spicy. You really get a lot of food for the price!! Mine was $9.95, my husband's, $8.25. I could have easily shared the New-T Chicken with my husband and we would have both gotten a good-sized mouthful. I didn't taste my husband's chicken lo mein, but since he nearly finished it (he swatted a gnat that got near his plate and wound up tipping his sweet tea over into it so he couldn't finish it all), I know it was good. If not for that unfortunate gnat incident I believe he would have eaten the entire thing.  All in all the food is good here, the service is adequate and the price is definitely fair for the portion size. We would definitely return.",

I arrived about 10 mins before their posted hours of opening, and to my surprise, they were open and had already seated people, taken call in orders, as well as, taking orders of guests like myself. Busy, busy, rainy Saturday!  I ordered the Asparagus the Great (lunch portion) and it was delicious! It was filled with asparagus, hibachi shrimp, and thinly sliced chicken, in a very deep flavorful broth. It also was served with fried rice and an egg roll. Delicious! The portion was enough for me to eat my leftovers for dinner.  I've never had a Boba Tea before and was feeling froggy! Why not?!? I ordered a Cookies and Creme flavored Boba. I didn't get any toppings because when I asked what they were, she said \"balls that have liquid in it that will melt in your mouth\". Uhmm, nah! I'm good! Lol. Nevertheless, it was so good and refreshing!! I'm craving another and wish I had gotten the large one (20 oz). I'm still baffled how it was made because it had a film sealed lid that I poked my large straw into. Maybe, they are made like those Milkshakes at the Sheetz. Those things are addicting too!   I enjoyed the swift order and great customer service. I'll be back for sure! I need another Cookies and Creme Boba and Asparagus the Great plate! It was listed as seasonal, but I hope when I visit again, it's still \"in season\". Lol",

There was one dish though, I believe it was the New-T chicken, if I'm wrong I'll fix this but it simply wasn't good. After getting it, I went through the reviews and pictures again to see if anyone had anything to say about it and it appears that everyone always orders the same dishes. This dish was never mentioned.  Also, there's a part of me that wishes they served egg foo young. It's one of my favorites from home and I know that this place would probably make it the way I like....it's all about the gravy.",

Last time I complained that the chicken didn't taste right and wanted something else. They made me pay for the substitution. Tonight I went back and the waiter actually made fun of a disabled child at my table. I asked him why he would do that and he said he was sorry and shouldn't have. I told the owner and she apologized and then handed me the bill with gratuity included. I refused to pay the gratuity and told me she should really not expect me to pay for that meal. The child was so upset she didn't eat and none of the other kids wanted to stay so all the food went to waste. She lowered it by ten percent and took off the gratuity. I'm amazed at the horrible customer service. A customer of fifteen years gone over a $70 bill and total lack of sympathy or compassion.",

But I didn't care for my meal.  The fried rice and the egg roll both had an excellent flavor, and honestly, if I had only eaten them, I would have given four stars easily. But the sweet and sour chicken, described as being lightly battered, was actually heavily battered. I'd say the proportion was about one part batter to two parts chicken. And the chicken itself was very dry.  If I do decide to try it again, I'll go with the beef and broccoli, as that seems much lighter and much tastier (my friend had the chicken and broccoli, but there's no way I'm eating their chicken again).  But I just don't see myself eating here again unless it's with a group that specifically wants to go here. The battered chicken was a two-out-of-five at best, and that's just me being nice.  When you're eating and you're thinking \"I wish I had gone to Thai House instead\", that's never a good thing, LOL.",

We had an amazing all vegetarian dish, and they even had eggplant. We also tried the chicken wings, both fried and steamed rice, the scallion pancakes, and a few chicken dishes. My husband ordered the egg drop soup and was loving it as well.  All in all, the service, the prices, the food temperature, the TASTE (OMG it was SO good), everything met my 5 star expectations.

Decor is contemporary, prices aren't high, if you're there for dinner you'll always end up with leftovers and service is friendly and attentive. They'll even wrap your moo shu for you tableside, which is a show in and of itself.  My personal favorites: chicken lettuce wraps (amazing), eggplant stir-fry, house lo mien, anything involving broccoli (but I love broccoli).  You can stay under $10 for lunch, dinner with an app will cost you a bit more, depending on what you're in the mood for.  Take out can take a bit, but wait times aren't extraordinarily long.",

The chili sauce was simply sweet and sour sauce with very little heat, if any at all.  The rice was fried earlier in the day and just kept warm.  If you are not from here, meaning Charlotte, and you have experienced Chinese food deeper south, farther north or further west, you will likely be disappointed.  I do not believe I will return. Just to give you an idea of how bad it was, I had a lot leftover that made it's way to the trash.   As far as service is concerned, they seemed pretty friendly.",

They are served with a plum sauce.   The general's tofu is amazing if you are vegetarian!  Lightly fried, crispy, and served with a sweet, mildly spicy, garlicy brown sauce.  Yum!  The ginger chicken and curry chicken are also other favorites.   After eating here, other local take-out Chinese places wont' cut it anymore.   If you choose to dine-in, the wait staff is very friendly and attentive.",

The pork fried rice ruined my entire evening.  It was CIAA weekend and I never used so many public restrooms before.  I had diarrhea the entire night.  I truly believe the pork was spoiled but they cooked it anyway and tried to cover up the rotten smell by flavoring the rice.  I plan to file a report to the health department.  Service was great and ambiance was decent too but the food was old.",

    "text": "My family and I used to eat here all the time. It was our go-to place if we wanted Chinese food.   We had been long standing happy customers until one evening we decided to order take-out. When I arrived to pick up our food, I was surprised to see that the food was ready and waiting (we only live 2.5 miles away).  Not thinking much about it I paid for the food and went home. When we began to eat we were once again surprised that our food was cold, disgusting and wrong.  At this point, no big deal as we have always had great food at this location.   Here is where the biggest suprise of the evening occurs...  My wife called back to management to let them know what had happened. We figured we would get an \"I'm sorry\" and replacement of our food. Not too much to ask. We were polite and understanding about the whole thing.   The response we received was not even close. The guy started by saying that if we would not have waited a half-hour to pick up our food, it would have been fresh.  This was not the case and blew my mind as it my have taken 10 minutes at the latest.   My wife goes on to mention that her chicken did not taste right. The manager then says that maybe they served her \"duck\".   So, my wife asks for our food to be remade. The guy refused. My wife then asks for our money back and the guy tells her no, reiterating that is our fault we took so long to pick up the food.  On top of his refusals to make things right, the man is rude regarding the issue.    Looking back I believe we got someone elses food who failed to pick it up. That would explain the duck order vs. the chicken dish ordered.  So, rather than wasting food which is money out of their pocket, they passed it on to what were loyal customers who they had seen many times eating at their establishment.    Then when we called to complain (at this time we were not upset or suspecting anything out of the norm) we were met with a less than a professional attitude.  Not good for business...  Never again.    Try Asian Cafe in Kannapolis (near Target shopping center beside Buffalo Wild Wings).   Great food, good pricing, nice atmosphere and very friendly staff.",

That evening I opened my Lo mein only to discover there was not even a single shrimp to be found. I called them to complain and they said being it back. Extremely annoyed I returned and all they did was apologize, give me another Lo mein and added one egg roll as my compensation! Never mind the gas and additional 30 minutes out of my life because of their stupid error! Who does that...how the hell you forget to add shrimp to shrimp Lo mein? They showed poor business ethics to a loyal customer, plus they reused the noodles because when I plated them at home they were broken up. I must pass 4 or 5 Chinese restaurants on my way to theirs. Needless to say everyone makes mistakes but I'm extremely disappointed in how they handled the situation and may not be returning again. They didn't show they cared about the mistake so I no longer care to spend my hard earned $$ there. They will probably delete this review.",
