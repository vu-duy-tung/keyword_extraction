Not only is this place different. Its AMAZING! The lady at the register was patient with me (i was a touch overwhelmed by the menu) and gave me phenomenal recommendations. I got the loaded chicken salad with the broccoli salad, and they were both so tasty my mouth is still watering. Everyone that works there was so pleasant and friendly! Next time, I'll try calling in my order, though. If you are any where near East Blvd, you NEED to stop by. I can't wait until I forget to bring my lunch to work again, so I have an excuse to go back to The Mayobird! The parking lot is big enough, but the place is so popular you might have to drive around the circle for a minute, but it's more than worth it!",

I had the athlete- a salad with two scoops of chicken salad, so I tried the southern (eggs and pickles) and the harvest (grapes, apples, pecans).  Both were very tasty, but southern was my fave. I brought most of the second scoop home. One thing to know- this place is at 1531 East Blvd , not 531 as it says in Yelp.",

    "text": "I entered the Mayobird hoping for a premier meat slathered in mayo experience, but I was left pretty unhappy.  I ordered the chicken roll and the curry chicken sandwich to split with a coworker.  It took the staff several minutes to even notice me at the register, even though the lunch rush was long since over.  The sandwiches were tiny, and totally over priced at around $8 a piece.  The chicken roll came on large puffy cold bread that was way thicker than the filling.  The chicken salad itself was serviceable, but the original (which should be their flagship) was totally bland and underseasoned.  The curry chicken was marginally better.  My to go order sat for several minutes in the window until I begged the wait staff to actually give it to me.  The worst part came after when I checked my credit card, and I had been overcharged by $30.00!  I tried to call the restaurant about this for a few hours and the phone line was busy the entire time...  it gets 2 stars for being edible, but the poor value and poor service will keep me from coming back.",

    "text": "I was a bit unsure about this place when it first opened, but I have been back several times now and I like it quite a bit. I know people complain that the the chicken salad doesn't have enough mayo, but I prefer it that way. I can't stand southern salads (and yes, I'm southern) that are dripping with the stuff, whether it's pimento cheese or macaroni salad or tuna or chicken salad, I can't deal with piles of mayo. It masks the actual salad flavors when you load it down with fatty goop. The Loaded and The Real Dill are my two personal favorites. If you're hungry and you want something filling, get the sliders, as they are the best value IMO. They come with lettuce and tomato and, for me, make for a very filling meal. I'm not as into their sides just due to my own personal taste, and I don't need them with my meal. Pita chips are good though. Service is always very friendly and solid, I get the unsweet tea which is always fresh (and sometimes flavored, which is nice!). Atmosphere and decor is really nice as well.  I do think that it would go a long way in appeasing people to add maybe a complimentary pickle spear (pickled okra or beans even, something fun?) or whatnot to the meal orders. I understand the logistics and finances when it comes to running a business, but it's the little things that can make or break it for a lot of customers. Or take a hint from JJ's across the street and consider a pickle bar or some such. Either way, the restaurant is a great place and a solid idea, and I hope they succeed in the long run.",

Went there once, and it wasn't (not sure why) and it was underwhelming.  (Advice to management - don't serve day-olds). But that only happened once and knowing what the fresh ones taste like - it was worth coming back again (and again).  Great atmosphere - the positive reviews are really accurate. I've only tried the Harvest but coming from someone who hates mayonnaise, this is an excellent chicken salad.  The soup is very rich and delicious.",

First, the flow of people trying to place orders was chaotic with a line going across the restaurant and servers constantly trying to break through it.  I got the \"swimmer\".  I asked about bread choices and was not told anything about that famous New England roll.  When I got back to work and got my sandwich out, one of the slices of bread was the heel!  I know some people like the heel but I wouldn't use it in a restaurant unless someone asks for it.  The amount of tuna on the sandwich was ridiculously small especially given the price they charge and on a personal note, how about a little tuna with your celery?  On their website they say that the celery is finely chopped and there is only a hint.  It was just bland and blah and I would not go back.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the lemon chess pie was delicious.",

I have tried a few different ones:  loaded potato, dill, egg+pickle, and blue cheese.  My favorite so far has been the dill.  The sides are also very good.  I have enjoyed the pasta salad and the broccoli salad.  There are other items on the menu such as quiche, but I have always gotten the chicken salad.",

The only reason you and your friends spend 20 minutes arguing about where to go to eat is because you forget places like this exist.  The concept is simple - everything is chicken salad. Don't like chicken salad, you're wrong. There's something for you here.  The people make the place like they do anywhere, but the ambiance mixed with carefully crafted look and feel of the outside and inside make this the go to spot for lunch on a Saturday.  My biggest frustration with The Mayobird is that Yelp! didn't tell me about this place. I had to hear about it from a friend, which I imagine is the only remaining rationale for why we haven't abandoned human interaction for our electronic devices as of yet.",

I'm a bit of a chicken salad snob, as I was spoiled with an awesome deli up in NY that just had mind blowing chicken salads. With that said, you have TONS of chicken salad options @ Mayobird. Some very good, some ok, some just mehhh. I had 3 sliders -- the Greek, the heater and the loaded - They were all just OK (3/5). I also had, the broccoli cheddar soup --  it was ok - not out of this world broccoli cheddar, but good.   I did get a chance to try \"THE WORLD FAMOUS CHICKEN ROLL as seen on The Food Network\" lol- Basically, you get to choose any of the salads and they come served on a new England roll that's toasted with butter. I had a two bites of this WFCR with original chicken salad, and that was pretty good (4/5) and my favorite by far!  The service is GREAT and everyone is extremely helpful and friendly. The decor is awesome too - you get this rustic farmhouse vibe with comfy couches everywhere. I will definitely come back here again...I will probably just stick with \"the original\" chicken salad. This would even be a great place to come to get some work done and have a cup of coffee. Overall, I would give it 3.5 Stars.",

Little chicken and rooster salt and pepper shakers everywhere and they give you a wooden spoon as a table marker - how cute is that!?  The good:  If you want a summer time lunch on a great patio that feels like a picnic. This is your place. They have amazing chicken salad mixtures that make up most of the menu - but they do also have other stuff if you aren't into chicken salad.  I had the southern style with added pickles and eggs because that is how my mom makes it and it was YUMtastic!  Great coffee, great dessert options. (I wanted that coconut cake!)  Only suggestion:   The breads were  a little dry. I would invest in a partnership with a local bakery or hire a baker to do some specialty breads and then this place would be double off the hook amazing!  Patio is awesome.  Extra star just for the fact that the owner or manager (not sure which) came up to us and explained the menu and how everything works.",

They were all good, but the Heater was definitely my favorite. Would order again. The broccoli salad was delicious as well. I like this place because they mainly server mayo based salads-- but don't overdo the mayo! It's just enough for moisture without making you feel like a gross human. It's a little pricey for the amount of food-- but where can you choose from 15 different kinds of chicken salad?",

Very girly, industrial rustic decor and cute patio out front. You order at the counter, grab a number and sit down/wait - perfect lunch spot. They also have their own large parking lot.  Called in my order of the health nut with a scoop of Italian (pesto and sundried tomatoes). It was delicious but maybe a little steep for $10 just for one lunch.",

    "text": "So I discovered the Mayobird the other day when my companion and I decided to treat ourselves to breakfast out. Driving down East Blvd. I quickly pulled out yelp in hopes of finding a new place; the Mayobird popped up so I we pulled in.  I like to eat breakfast out and in this area I expected to shell out about $8-11 per plate. However, I was pleasantly amazed when I saw that basically everything on the breakfast menu is less than $5.  We ordered quiche, French toast, and honeybun coffee cake. Everything was delicious, the coffee came tasted EXACTLY like a honeybun and the French toast was more like bread pudding than breakfast! In the end we took left overs of the quiche and French toast which made a great lunch that day and breakfast the next.  The OJ is also legit! They also have full coffee house drink options (normal coffee house prices) and serve lunch (so many chicken salad choices!) but I can't speak to the taste of any of that.   In the end, I am in love and will be visiting again and again!",

The counter service has been great, though it's a little awkward when you order to-go during lunch since the line area isn't marked and there's not much room to wait.   The pita chips with the salad add a nice crunch. The chicken itself is rather finely chopped, so don't expect a lot of texture from the meat unless it's got some tasty add-ins. I would recommend the fruit and nut for a tasty combination with the raspberry vinaigrette.",

Judging from the number of people, we beat the brunch rush.  Yay us! The decor is nice and it would be someplace we would love to frequent.  We both ordered breakfast sandwiches. We were both disappointed. She ordered a croissant, that came out chewy, she suspects it was heated in a microwave.  I ordered egg and cheese on a brioche. The egg was comically small compared to the size of the bread and tough and chewy as if prepared in a microwave.  The kicker on this was that our order took about 20 minutes before it came out. We had a solid view of the expo window, it frequently backed up. They seemed far from under staffed. 4 people working the front, 2 in the kitchen.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful, the food incredibly disappointing.",

That sadness quickly dissipated however.  The parking here is easy, or was for breakfast as they have a big parking lot.  The inside is cozy and there are several tables great for a meeting, knocking work out, or catching up with friends.    I ordered a PSL because I am basic and proud.  I ordered it with no dairy because dairy in coffee makes me feel icky.  It was a great beverage and not too sweet, perfect way to start the day and perfect for those of you out there that admit to liking pumpkin spice like me.  I ordered the quiche of the day which was a spicy jalapeno.  It had a flaky pastry crust, egg, cheese, and of course plenty of spice.  It was heavenly and I love how the egg dishes are made in single serve bowls.  I will definitely be back for the chicken salad next time I'm in town - stay tuned!",

Not only all the employees so friendly, they are so helpful with questions, offer samples and definitely show a care for their job. Most recently I have tried 'The Southern' chicken salad. Okay, if you like pickles and egg, this chicken salad is one to try. The chicken is thinly sliced with mayo, pickles and egg and hit the spot.  I also tried 'The Gobbler', a turkey sandwich. Now, let me tell you this is not sliced turkey deli meat, rather sliced cooked turkey that is so cute, cut somewhat thck, but fresh and juicy.  I had the \"Gobbler\" with lettuce, tomato cheese and mayo and loved it.   I also cannot forget to tell you about the Home Made Chips. They are coated in a salt special seasoing sauce and cooked to perfection, perfect for dipping in their soups.  I still have yet to try the Chicken Pot Pie, but that is on my list next. So happy this place is just down the street and love the large menu variety that seems to accomodate everyone.",

    "text": "What a great experience.  Aside from the parking that is very limited, the food is well worth it.  The Mayo Bird has a variety of menu options but I chose the Original Chicken Salad Sandwich.  There is no way to remove and ingredient, so having to eat celery in the chicken salad was not my favorite part.  I did enjoy the soft bread and the side of bacon and broccoli salad.    The servers were very friendly and the location is awesome.  It is connected to the Summit Room, another one of my favorite places to eat.  I would definite come back to the Mayo Bird to try some of their other dishes.    Awesome job Mayo Bird, but I do believe parking may be your limiting factor.",

No little container of cole slaw. Nothing but an $8 sandwich.  To me, this is really unforgivably chintzy.   The harvest chicken salad was okay but a bit bland. The bread was also rather dry.  Such a shame. I really, really wanted to like this place so much more, if only to go back and enjoy the atmosphere again. But I guess I won't be headed back.  MayoBird...please take the hint...I've never even SEEN a sandwich as the only item in a to-go box! Even a pickle spear would have turned this into a 3- or 4-star review.",

They have all kinds of chicken salads so if you're not a mayo person don't let the name fool you, there's plenty of non mayo options! Support this local spot, you will not be disappointed!

    "text": "Charming place in the old Caribou coffee joint.  Staff are very friendly and work hard - food comes out in just a few minutes.  I've been three times now for lunch during the week.  I have three problems with this place (or, as consultants like to call them, \"opportunities\"): 1)  Value.  The price paid for what you receive doesn't fare that great compared to their lunchtime competitors on East Blvd or elsewhere.  Fairly steep for a sandwich and a few pieces of broccoli and raisins. 2)  Taste.  I love chicken salad.  Really.  It could be it's own food group with me.  I really want this place to be successful.  All of their chicken salads I've tried (about 5 of them) are dry.  Really dry.  Mayo based or non-mayo based.  All dry.  Their best chicken salad I've tried is a special (BBQ chicken salad - really unique flavors with cinnamon!) and it was still dry.  Their bread - dry.  It's hard to decipher if the bread is just old or it's fresh and just lacks moisture.  Broccoli salad tastes great, but see above.....portion size of broccoli is somewhere between 5 and 7 pieces the two times I've ordered it. 3)  The details.  Their pricing is a little weird.  If you order a sandwich and a side, it's $8.95.  Add cheese to your sandwich for $0.50 more.  Total $9.45.  Or, you can order a \"melt\" and a side, which is a sandwich with cheese that just happens to be melted, for $8.95.  Huh?  If you place a take out order, they give you this tiny cheap plastic fork, no spoon, no knife.  Most of the time, that would be ok, except when your ordered side salad comes with large pieces of lettuce.  That fork's not cutting anything.  Inside the restaurant, like I wrote above, the decor is charming and the staff are great, but nothing flows well from the guest's perspective.  Speed is fine, but standing in line to order you have wait staff walking through you.  You walk past the counter area to place your order then back the opposite direction to get your drinks and then a different direction to sit down or wait for your order.  None of these things are earth-shattering, \"stay away from this place\"-type faults.  With a few small changes, this place has the location, the great front porch, the unfulfilled niche, the staff etc to be successful.  I wish them well.",

It is a little overwhelming at first because there's so many different styles of chicken salad to choose from. Don't worry, there are a few other options than chicken salad if you don't want that. The restaurant is attached to The Summit Room. It's cute, lots of character and has a homey feel to it. You could come here and get some work done, eat breakfast, or grab lunch. They also have a coffee/tea bar. I've been here several times and have tried to order something different every time. I've never left disappointed.

Very rustic country decor, with a fast casual counter and chalk board menu. Lots of chicken salad options- hence the name Mayo Bird!  I chose the classic salad on their signature chicken roll. Very good, but I was a little jealous that I wasn't more adventurous with how many varieties they have to offer. My husband had a spicy jalapeno chicken salad which was really good. Finished off the meal with two perfect cappuccinos and a giant slice of their honey bun cinnamon coffee cake.  We dined on their patio, and even though it is on a busy street it is absolutely lovely. Some tables are partially shaded with tree cover, some have umbrellas, and they also have a welcoming covered porch with oversized rocking chairs. The staff are all friendly and upbeat.

Chicken Salad Chik's is so much better.  Chicken and Dumplings - too much pepper   Props to the owners for having a recycling bin.

    "text": "The Mayobird is a fun little rustic place that has an expansive menu that features twists on a classic southern sandwich.  My wife and I dropped in on a whim for a quick lunch because I had wanted to try this place for a while. First off, their menu is pretty expansive. I was impressed with not only their options of chicken salad, but also their breakfast items that they serve all day. I settled on the harvest chicken salad sandwich and my wife got the quiche of the day. While waiting for our food, we ended up sitting on one of the couches set up in the place. Since it splits a building with The Summit Room, I find it to have a similar overall style with a little more laid back atmosphere. Once we got our food we dived in. I found the sandwich to be pretty good, but wish I had gotten the sliders so I could have tried more varieties of their chicken salad. However, my wife's quiche was awesome and we both agreed it was the better of the two dishes.  Overall this was a fun stop and I would have liked the chance to have a coffee and hang out longer. Prices are a bit high for the sandwiches in my opinion (~$7.50 w/o any sides), but my wife's breakfast quiche was on point and a good size for $5. I would recommend stopping by as they hold decent ground against the booming food scene that has developed in Dillworth over the last few years.",

So, when my husband said he wanted to check out Mayobird real bad, I secretly just hoped there would be something on the menu that wasn't mayo based! Mayobird delivered.  Cute little space right beside Summit Room. Lots of tables and couches for seating. You order at the front and they bring your food out. My first thought was how big the menu was. There were so many daily items as well!! Lots of different varieties of chicken salad and lots of other options (soups, breakfasts, salads, etc).   My husband got a chicken salad sandwich and I got the Breakfast Casserole. It came out in this cute ramekin and was a very nice serving. Man, this casserole was delish. Pretty much perfect for a cold day as it was nice and hot and cheesy. The flavors were amazing together.  Super friendly staff and awesome lunch experience!",

(Yes, there is a difference between Italian and Pizza.)  Thai?  Chinese?  Sushi?  Chicken?  Steak?  I could go on, but chances are you wouldn't immediately default to chicken salad.  Am I right?  It's just not the kind of thing that's top of mind.  The irony here is that once you've experienced The Mayobird, you'll want it regularly!  You'll find The Mayobird amongst the many restaurants on East Blvd.  It shares a building with The Summit Room.  Walk in to find country decor with family style seating and sofas.  Approach the counter to select from a menu boasting more chicken salad variations then you can possibly imagine, and let one of the friendly Mayobird employees know your preference.  From there you'll be given a numbered wooden spoon to place in the spoon holder at the center of each table.  A food runner will bring your delicious chicken salad to you when it's ready.  Chicken salad not in your wheelhouse?  All good.  They offer other options.  Try the pimento cheese.  You won't regret it!  The sides and soups are also amazing.  Oh wait, I can't forget the breakfast!  Grab a cup of coffee, a dessert, whatever you fancy, and tap in to the Wi-Fi as you unwind on the sofa by the fireplace.  This place has just enough southern charm.  It's a great place for breakfast and lunch, but they close at 4pm.  Unless you're over 80, I'd say that rules them out as a dinner option.  I suggest hitting them up on a Saturday in the spring or fall for a couple of to-go sandwiches to enjoy on a blanket at nearby Freedom Park.",

    "text": "Such a cute spot in the heart of Dilworth. We were greeted warmly and received a good explanation of an overwhelming menu. They make chicken salad a million ways! I went for the \"loaded version\"- bacon, sour cream, chives and cheddar- on a croissant. WONDERFUL! The flavors all came together well. I will admit that I was surprised. I guess bacon does make everything better! I chose macaroni salad (mayo based, of course at a place named \"Mayo Bird\", right?). It, too, was very tasty. We will definitely go back...maybe for breakfast which they also serve.",

    "text": "I've been dying to come here for a while - any spot that specializes in something as specific as chicken salad is a thumbs up in my book. I love all the variety of flavors, ranging from dill, to nuts and berries (almond and cranberries), southern with pickles and eggs, roasted jalapenos, greek yogurt, etc. They also do a special flavor of the month, based on customers' preferences and feedback (COOL!).   The menu is fabulous. Basically, you pick a flavor of chicken salad, and pick a combo - you can get it on brioche, whole wheat bread, a croissant, a pita, mini buns, or even over a salad or paired with soup. You can get 1 or 2 scoops. Initially, I didn't think 1 scoop would be enough, but paired with the sandwich and side, it was plenty. However, it was very tasty so I easily could have done two scoops.   I went with the MAYOBIRD, including a choice of sandwich with 1 side. For the chicken salad, I chose the Greek chicken salad, which consists of greek yogurt, feta, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes and olives, on top of a croissant. The croissant was in one word: amazing. It was soft, buttery in a light way, and not too heavy. I also got a side salad. Props to Mayobird for not upcharging for a side salad like many places do. They do have many tasty side options themselves, including grape salad, broccoli salad, fruit, potato chips, homemade pita chips, or pasta salad. They actually give you some homemade pita chips with the side salad, so bonus to get to taste them. I would have liked them to be a little softer but alas, they were still good.   The inside is adorable with wooden tables and chairs, and a large sitting area with couches too. Great breakfast/lunch spot, or place to just come hang. They serve breakfast all day (!) and also have a coffee bar, so it also serves as a great location for studying or just camping out and getting some work done with great food. The staff is very friendly and timely - my food was ready within 5 minutes and they came by to grab my plate when I was finished.  Also like Nikki said, they have the BEST ICE here. I love the little small pebble types. It makes the drink taste SO MUCH better, you don't even know.  Great experience here - I will definitely be back to try more flavors.",

I ordered the sliders and added the Jalapeno one just to try. The pesto chicken salad is the only one that is made without mayo. It was amazing. The chicken salad was fresh and the pesto was good. The Jalapeno was also very good! There was some heat from the peppers but not enough to make it not enjoyable. I thought the southern was good but the other two I ordered knocked it out the park.

The Plain Chicken salad, is just that...Plain.  It's not bad, but it didn't blow me away.  I suggest going with one of their 7/8 other flavored/mixed ingredients chicken salad options.  My biggest beef was with the Broccoli salad...i love this side!  My wife makes her grandmother's recipe a lot.  However, her grandma would probably flip out, if i told her they make theirs without the sugared mayo and cheddar cheese.

I've tried almost all of their chicken salads but my favorites are the Real Dill (dill) and Big Bird (curry). The consistency of their chicken salad is what I like the most; it's smoother than most which I prefer.   I have tried a few breakfast items, a quiche of the day and frittata cup. Both were good but I really like going here for the chicken salad.   If you find yourself in the mood for a mocha, I think this place has one of the best mochas in town. It is not too sweet and perfectly blended.   It's a cozy space with friendly service on top of it all. All around a good place to stop in occasionally.",

    "text": "There are times when even the heartiest of appetites needs to dial back a little and opt for a healthier dish. Because of that, we decided to try Mayobird for a Saturday lunch last weekend.  First of all, it's easy to drive right past the place if you're not actively looking for it. It blends in with a whole bunch of other stuff on East Blvd. We pulled in to the somewhat crowded parking lot, undeterred by a large gaggle of mothers getting out of their cars for a baby shower (or maybe a baby sprinkle or baby hailstorm or any number of other baby-related meteorological abnormalities).   I guess we came at one of their peak times...it was LOUD inside. You order at the counter, which would've been grand if my elderly eyes could read the menu. It was written on the wall, but it was far back enough to where I couldn't read the smaller lines. I did feel like the employee we ordered from was a little on the brusque side and made me feel kinda rushed, which was unfortunate. Plus, I could barely hear her.  Anyway, we sat at a table and waited for our food to be brought over. It's reasonably cute inside, sort of like a comfortable rustic vibe.   When I got my food, I was disappointed to see that it wasn't a sandwich--it was two large balls of chicken salad plopped on my plate. I had failed to realize that the Double Dip's two scoops is literally scoops on the plate and not on any, you know, bread. To be fair, this was my fault for being unable to see the menu and take my time since I started getting that anxious feeling where everyone is mad at me and the room is closing in and I just need to hurry the hell up. My scoops were the Harvest (apples, grapes, pecans) and the Blue Bird (blue cheese and walnuts). I found the Harvest pretty enjoyable, with all the different textures and whatnot. But the Blue Bird tasted very thick and a bit on the bland side. I couldn't taste the walnuts in it at all, and the blue cheese was pretty muted, too. My side of pita chips wasn't wonderful. On a positive note, they do have really nice soft ice for the drinks there. Hahaha.   All in all, it was a decent enough meal, but I'm not sure I'll become a regular any time soon. I would like to try one of these on actual bread some time and see if that changes my mind. For now, it's an okay place.",

    "text": "I have been curious to try this place for quite sometime now and finally made the move yesterday for a carryout lunch.  The dining room area was pretty full, even thought it was an hour to closing time.  I was greeted by Andrea who was working the front counter.  She was sooooo nice and helpful.  She walked me through the entire menu and helped me with my questions, because it is a bit overwhelming at first.  There are many options to choose from.   I chose the Mayo Bird, which is a chicken salad sandwich and one side.  I had the pasta salad and picked up the Pepsi cola cake for dessert.  The sandwich was good, I got it toasted on cibatta bread.  I might get the pita next time, because I like it a little softer.  The pasta salad was extra good.  I am a fan of mayo based pasta salad and really enjoyed it.  It has a bit of a spicy taste, almost like wasabi as well.  The Pepsi cola cake was too sweet-which is odd for me, because I like everything sweet-from pasta sauce to macaroni salad....but this....waaaay to much.  I think what I liked best about this place was the layout and decor of the restaurant.  It is so cool!  There is an open floor plan with many little spots to sit from open tables, to little couches and more intimate areas.  It is decorated so hipster and just makes you feel good walking in.    Many choices of food and drink and an excellent atmosphere.",

The breakfast casserole is a must have because it comes with everything.   For lunch though, there is a chicken salad for everyone. It is fresh and light and there is so much comfortable seating that I feel like I'm at home again. They have the REALLY good pellet ice that you can chew on too! Definitely a must try for something fresh and different if you are in the Dilworth area or after a morning at Freedom Park.",

I think there are a few other things on the menu for those that don't like chicken salad too. We got the curry, Gorgonzola pear, southern (hard boiled egg and pickle), and loaded (pimiento cheese and bacon) chicken salad scoops. All of them were amazing. The curry was the most unique. Of all of them, the pear Gorgonzola was probably our least favorite, but it was still good. The side of broccoli salad was also very good. I'll be back to visit and try more chicken salad for sure!",

I could not believe the amount of choices they had, I've never seen so many different types of chicken salad! I was tempted to get a to go container of each one but decided I'd just have to go back at least once a week to try them all!   The southern version was really good. I would have liked to taste more pickles because I'm obsessed with pickles but that's just me. Delicious regardless. The pasta salad was perfect, tasted fresh and refreshing. My friend got the grape salad which she said was awesome so definitely need to try that as well.   The atmosphere is so cute and very welcoming and warm, super homey. I loooove how they have different size, shape tables and all different size and shape chairs! The staff is really friendly and willing to go above and beyond to please their customers. Such a great experience and I can't wait to go back.",

It is pricey but you know that you're getting the best quality of everything. Atmosphere of the place is also very impressive; cozy but spacious, always plenty of seating, and friendly staff.   Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they had a gluten-free bread option. The scoops are fine and good, but I'm always envious of the other patrons' rolls and sandwiches.

I got the two scoops with pasta salad. I got the loaded and southern chicken salad. Loaded was packed with flavor with the bacon and cheddar. Southern was just as good with the eggs and onions. Pasta salad was good too. It's mayonnaise based but not too heavy. Had fresh peppers in it too! My friend got the Italian and Greek chicken salad. The Italian was good and different. She wasn't crazy about the Greek chicken salad. My husband got the sliders. He got the curry, Italian and jalapeno. The curry was good but different! There was no way I could of finished the whole slider because it was so rich. My husband loved it though! The jalapeno was awesome!! Had great spice to it and it was popping with flavor! I would definitely get that next time! Broccoli salad was also good especially with the bacon.   We all had a great time. Service was awesome. Yummy!!",

I was hoping for chucks of chicken and crispy ingredients to add some crunch and texture but no luck. I'd be interested in trying out a different variation next time as well as their other items like the Chicken Pot Pie or the Back Nine, their take on pimento cheese.",

The Mayobird, as the name suggests, is all about the chicken salad. They have a ton of interesting varieties, and they are all delicious. This isn't your grandma's chicken salad. We got scoops of BBQ, buffalo, loaded potato, Greek; there is a chicken salad for everyone here. My favorite and regular is the Loaded. No potato in this, but everything else you would expect in a loaded baked potato. Cheddar, bacon, green onions, it's legit. Pair that with their homemade pita chips and ancho ranch, and you've got a show stopping gourmet Sunday brunch on your hands. The exterior is enchanting, with vines wrapping the front of the building. The interior is just as charming; it's rustic and inviting. The staff is super warm and welcoming, and make sure to say hello to their regulars. The *only* bit of feedback, and this is a tiny one, is this: Bring back the brioche.  Stop by here on a lazy, rainy day and cozy up to the best chicken salad you've ever had. Don't worry, we won't tell your grandma.",

Space: cute farmhouse style cafe with chicken art scattered throughout. There's cozy couches and tables of various sizes for big groups and small. They also have a bar area to sit at. Outside is my favorite- rocking chairs are on the porch and tables are outside under shade. Great place to do work, read, or relax with friends.   Food: Breakfast all day! My family loved the yogurt w granola, omelette, egg sandwiches. I've been for lunch too and they're famous for their numerous creative chicken salads. If you're vegetarian or pescatarian, their lunch options are limited to pimento cheese and tuna salad (both are delicious). The grape salad side is amazing. I like that you can combine different combos of  \"salads\", sides, soups    Drinks: they offer coffee, lattes, tea  Parking: they have an attached parking lot (shared with The Summit Bar next door). Also it's easy to walk from here to other Dilworth spots like Fern, Kid Kashew, Bad Daddy's, Lebowski's",

    "text": "Famous for their chicken salad, but also have amazing quiches, baked goods, and Pina Colada Cake! This is a great little local brunch spot -- and breakfast is served all day. They serve Enderly Coffee, so this is also a great little spot to just sit at the coffee bar and read a book, work on your laptop, or enjoy company. The space is eclectic and inviting, just like the nice staff!  If you're just trying this place out, I recommend the Sliders because you can pick 3 different types of chicken salad from their menu to go on your mini buns.   Chicken salad flavors I recommend:  - for good classics that can never go wrong The Nuts and Berries with almonds and cranberries or The Harvest with apples, grapes, and pecans (this flavor sells out fast). - for something different, I'd go with The Loaded, which has sour cream, bacon, chives, and cheddar.   Any quiche of the day they have is a good one to select. It comes in a ramekin, hot and with flaky crust. And the egg is absolutely fluffy to perfection.  Their baked goods, like muffins and pastries are very tasty, but my favorite is their moist Pina Colada Coconut Cake...wow is it not too dense, moist, not too sweet, generously sprinkled with coconut...great treat to share with someone!",

It dawned on me the day of the event that we never went over it so I called them & asked. I was told by the girl on the phone that this stuff would not be provided so I had to run to Harris teeter last min & grab utensils. Right after I spent my money buying this stuff I get a call from a Mayo bird saying they could throw in the utensils, but by this time it was too late. They were on time with the delivery & the food was good, but I was just a little annoyed with the utensil situation.",

They specialize in chicken salad and is it ever good!  The breakfast menu looked great too.  But the best part was the cheerful service of Norissa who was so helpful and, well, kind. Everyone seemed to love her!  I will come back with others for sure--and there is plenty of parking which is hard to find on East!",

You walk into an adorable farmhouse decor. Different sized tables with with mismatched chairs. You order at the front. They have many different types of their chicken salads (I ordered the fruit and nuts - almonds and cranberries). You can get sandwiches, soups, salads and scoops. Bread options were rolls, pita and croissant (at no extra charge). I was a little annoyed because I wanted to order their pair lunch option which is a cup of soup and half a sandwich or side. I asked If instead of half a sandwich I could get a half scoop and the guy at the register tried to upsell me and said there was no way to get just half a scoop with that order. So that was kind of annoying. Once you order and pay, you're given a wooden spoon with a number on it.   The food came out quickly on wooden reusable plates covered with a wax paper and plastic silverware.   The chicken salad was actually great! I really enjoyed it. All white meat chicken! The cranberries and slivered almonds were tasty too.   They looked like they had a breakfast menu too. I'll for sure be back to try more flavors of chicken salad! And on that next time I'll be taking my food out to the rocking chairs on the patio.",

With over 10 varieties on the classic favorite plus monthly specials, you can have it your way - bread, salad, alone, with sides - you pick. Service is quick and friendly. The environment is casual. When the weather is warm, they have one of the best patios in town, to sit outside, watch people pass and enjoy nice weather. Want to be shaded/covered? Enjoy one of their many rocking chairs on the large porch.   Their coffee bar is also a great place to hang out, but beware they close at 4pm to transition into their dinner service to connected restaurant The Summit Room.   Why not the 5th star? Nothing here is mind blowing or incredible. It's perfect for exactly what it is, but I think 5 stars should be for the exceptional. It's not from bad food or a bad experience.",

My husband loved his 3 choices (harvest chicken salad was his favorite) and he enjoyed the potato buns the sandwiches are served on.   I don't like potato buns (no flavor and totally blah in my opinion) so I didn't eat the buns and just ate my chicken salad. I liked the caprese chicken salad and the southern chicken salad. Neither my husband nor I cared for the pesto chicken salad .... there was so much pesto in it you couldn't taste anything else. The 3 slider meal didn't come with a side, and I wished it did.   We sat at the bar, and I must say the coffee area (behind the bar) was in total disarray and very unappetizing. Dirty towels, spills, abandoned cups of coffee and drinks. It was a total mess and not something you wanted to look at while eating ... made me wonder what the kitchen must look like that is totally tucked away from diners.  Overall, this place was ok. Not somewhere I'm dying to come back to but I also wouldn't totally rule it out if a friend wanted to dine here.",

    "text": "I was on East Boulevard recently running errands and wanted a fast casual spot for a quick lunch. Mayobird delivered!   On this visit, I ordered the Double Dip -- two scoops and a side. With a fountain soda, it came to just under $16. A pricy lunch but you know what they say... You get what you pay for! It was high quality, fresh food and I had enough left over to take to-go for a late afternoon snack.   Everything comes with a few pita chips, which add a nice salty, crunch to the meal. I choose the Harvest and the Asian for my scoops. The Harvest is a regular offering, with apples, grapes, and pecans. It was good but I wish it had more apples and grapes. The Asian was a weekly special and my favorite of the two. It had a wonderful but understated peanut and soy sauce flavor. I'd order it every time if it was on their regular menu!  The restaurant itself is tucked off East Blvd. and has a warm, homey feel. There were lots of patrons there working, and I could see why. It's an easy place to want to settle into for a while. Their coffee bar seemed to be cranking out delicious beverages, too. So, caffeine fuel for all those hard workers! Great outdoor patio seating as well, which I took advantage of since it was a beautiful day.   Icing on the cake is the owner is also the founder of Behailu Academy, supporting local youth, so you're eating good food for a good cause at Mayobird!",

It's a cute lunch spot off a busy area of Dilworth that's casual and offers lots of indoor and outdoor seating. There's what feels like a million different types of chicken salad, and combos that can include soups or salads, sandwich bread, croissants, no bread.... basically you name it & they can do it. I got the combo that came with a salad & scoop of chicken salad. The actual salad was a really good size (I could've eaten alone for lunch) & came with diced cucumbers & tomatoes. The scoop of chicken salad was also pretty sizable & cake with 3-4 pita chips to eat them with. I got the chicken salad with grapes, apples, & walnuts. It was amazing & I'll have a hard time not ordering it every time I come here from now on. The pita chips were large, thick, & had a sweetness to them.",

There are so many flavors of chicken salad that you would find it hard to decide on the kind that you would want to try on any given day.  Today, a cold and wet day, I opted for the chicken and dumpling soup followed by the house salad with one scoop of the Harvest chicken salad and one scoop of the Southern Chicken salad.  As usual, it was all just spectacular.  My friend, Leah, and I sat in the back room next to the bar. I never knew that room even existed before today and I found it even cozier than the main room.  This is a fun, happy place to get a fast quality bite of food.  I recommend it highly.  My only suggestion would be for them to expand to other parts of the city!   I would give anything to have one even closer to where I live!    I think it would be wildly popular off of the Providence/ Rea Road corridor!     GO GO GO!",

Real dill was what I expected from chicken salad and it felt familiar. Southern had eggs in it which I loved and the loaded chicken salad reminded me of a yummy baked potato!

I actually had never tried chicken salad before last week (crazy since I have lived in Charlotte my whole life) and they let me sample as many as I wanted. I was torn between the harvest and the loaded but ultimately went with the harvest on a croissant ( the harvest is their most popular ). It was very good but I do feel like the croissant overpowers the flavor of the chicken salad. The pita chips have good flavor but can be quite hard.  I really like the sauce that comes with them (tastes like a spicy ranch) but I recently tried the broccoli cheddar soup and much prefer that to the chips.  All the soups as well as the rest of the menu is homemade in house (except the breads which are from a local bakery, Nova).  This place is a must try if you are looking for a delicious, light, healthy lunch!",

I couldn't even tell there were other ingredients in it (like supposedly feta and olives).  The bacon broccoli salad on the side was awesome though.

Moving on to the best part- Chicken. So many options to choose from. I tried the Greek cs, Liz had the Italian and Buffalo cs. All great options. The broccoli side was oddly good. This was all topped off with fresh, tasty coffee made my Rob. He was clearly the friendliest employee. The other employees didn't seem to be very happy.

The Buffalo was okay but the other three were amazing! The grape salad is a unique side dish that is worth trying it is more like a dessert. It's casual dining, you can sit outside there are heaters and I highly recommend it.",

The rest:  I paid $11ish for a cup of coffee and a turkey sandwich (wasn't feeling chicken salad but how hard is it to make a turkey sandwich?). There was half a piece of lettuce on the sandwich - not a huge deal I suppose, unless you asked for extra lettuce. Ahem. I tried the grape salad with nuts - a cup of perfectly good grapes, a few chopped walnuts and some runny, perhaps formerly yogurt mixture coating it all. There wasn't a place for us to place our order number spoons when we sat at the rocking chairs so holding them up was kind of a drag. And the coffee?!?! Gads, just don't get me started. If I'm going to spend three dollars, I'd rather it not be on some burnt-tasting, stale, ill-flavored cup of \"coffee\"...  Do what you want - my roommate goes to Mayobird at least twice a week. I on the other hand feel that some food trucks shouldn't be restaurants. Stick to what you know.",

For years, this location was a Caribou Coffee, where individuals were welcomed to sit for hours, reading, yapping, or tapping at the laptop - regardless of whether you spent any money there.   When I walked in for a business lunch, I felt I was surveying the same scene. There were no seats available - not surprising for lunch hour at a new spot on East Boulevard with a cute name. Yet many people seated weren't eating, and some large tables were occupied by one person.  98% of the customers were women. Surprising in these health-conscious times, considering \"mayonnaise\" is the root word of the establishment.  Mayobird could likely benefit from a more structured seating program - at least during peak lunch hours.",

A tie between the Nuts and Berries and Harvest chicken salads. Love it with a green salad. It's nice to have a relatively healthy, high protein meal option around. Their outdoor seating is killer- covered picnic tables, rocking chairs on the porch and more seating in their front courtyard. Inside is spacious as well. Staff is always friendly and helpful, as their menu has so much to offer. If you love chicken salad, then The Mayobird is a MUST! Oh and breakfast is served all day. Love that!",

The decor makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in the door. It feels like your Grandmother's farmhouse out in the country (my Grandma lived in Boca in a condo, but this is what I imagine this would feel like).   The service is always on point. Very kind employees who are there to ensure that you are happy with your experience.   On a recent visit, I watched as the guest next to me had his order wrong and the staff brought out the correct order VERY quickly and provided a free side and dessert to apologize. Just a nice attention to detail that made me want to come back.   The patio is AMAZING. I want to spend all day sitting in one of the oversized rocking chairs, sipping the Chai Vanilla Latte in the fall.   Food wise I have had a couple of the chicken salads, breakfast and dessert. For chicken salad I have tried the Skinny, Greek and Buffalo and loved them all. I will agree that they are on the dry side and I would like a tad bit more moisture, but still tasty. My favorite so far was a scoop of the buffalo on a salad with a side of ranch dressing.  For breakfast I had the Kale and Goat Cheese Frittata and it was delish, but the star of the show is their Honey Bun Coffee Cake. This thing is OUT OF THIS WORLD good. I have gone back twice this week since trying it on Sunday to get my fix. The icing, crunchy cinnamon, moist cake and pecans are just perfection.   I hope that the Mayo Bird is around for a long time because I just love it.",

    "text": "We Love the Dilworth neighborhood and was looking forward to trying this place after seeing them on The Food Network's Food Court Wars (which they were the runner-ups).  Anyway, 1st impression - place is Very cute, quaint & funky.  Love the location on East Blvd. I(former Caribou Coffee & Bruegger's Bagels shop).  We went on 4th of July morning (Friday Holiday) around 9:30 a.m.  Menu was pricey, but a lot of the breakfast item sounded unique and fun, so we thought ok, we'll try it.  They were OUT of the 1st 3 things I tried to order:  The Ham & Yam, The Hash brown Cup, Then the Skillet.  So, Annoyance aside at this point, let just find SOMETHING I could eat.  My sister & I both ordered a Honey Bun Coffee Cake, an espresso and a milk.  Total was over $13 for that.    We take our Spoon out to our table and wait for them to bring us our food/drink order.  It was now about 9:40 a.m.  Around 10, our drinks came out - The tiniest espresso you have ever seen, and a milk.  NO FOOD!  So, we waited another 10-15 minutes...really?  My sister went in to check on our food - THEY HAD LOST THE TICKET!!!!!!!  Not quite sure our drinks got to us...but ok.  Our coffee cake quickly came out to us.  Very sweet, but tasty.  Would I pay almost $4 for it again?  No.  They DID comp our entire meal because of the screw up, but at that point it was already too little too late.  In case you think this was isolated, the people right next to us who got there about 2 minutes before we did, ALSO waited about 30 minutes for their food.  It was at least cooked food, so ok.  But still.  Their other food very well might be tasty - we will never know.",

    "text": "I had read the hype about MayoBird in CharMag and the first people on Yelp and so I went for lunch and was disappointed but hubs went for breakfast and raved so I returned for breakfast/coffee and was super happy. So my rating is an average of my 2 star lunch rating and 4.5 star breakfast.  For lunch, there are a number of chicken salads you can choose from with various ingredients. I am actually a mayo-hater, so I'm probably the worst person to bring here, but I was happy to opt for the colonel mustard which was dijon-based. Hubs had a mayo-based one which wasn't super mayo-y but he also complained about it being dry. The main problem we had with our sandwiches (he had his on bread, mine on croissant) was that it didn't come with anything else. I really wanted LTO and maybe chutney or some sort of spread. He also wanted something a little extra. It is just meat on a hunk of bread, but if you had a function and got a quart of it to go, I bet it would be great. I do like that they don't mash the crap out of the chicken and it's more chunky and resembles real chicken. There's another chicken salad place in town which shall remain nameless that has a gross consistency. So I'll take dry and chunky any day over that grossness. My hope is that they start adding accoutrements to the sandwiches and maybe some additional choices for those who might not like chicken salad.   But let's move on to happier times- their quiche!!! Forget the whole \"real men don't eat quiche\" thing- the sausage quiche is flaky, filling, flavorful and fabulous. Oh, maybe I shouldn't mix \"real men\" and fabulous in the same concept. Anyway, just try it. Few places nail quiche crust but they did. It makes me want to try their dessert pies that they offer. They also have a caprese quiche. They are much more filling than the frittata cup.    Their fruit cup side is absolutely delicious- forget about the tasteless or soggy fruit salad you get other places. These grapes are super crisp and melon fresh and sweet. Thank you!!  Their coffee (if you stay) comes bold and strong in a ginormous mug that keeps you warm on a cold day. There are so few places that brew good coffee- I guess they realized if they're going to fill the shoes of Caribou, they better make damn good coffee and they delivered. I appreciated that the space is large and it's a perfect place to meet someone. I believe they might have wifi.   Bottom line: great place to meet someone for breakfast or just nosh on a quiche with great coffee. Or pick up a wide variety of chicken salads to go for a shower or event.",

What does the opposing team's student section chant when they're losing?  \"Over-rated\" *clap, clap, clap, clap, clap*  \"Over-rated\".  That in a nutshells describes Mayobird although thankfully my chicken salad at least didn't contain any nutshells.  Maybe my experience would have been better if I went sometime other than the lunch rush but nevertheless...First off while I know it's no longer a big deal because we all have GPS but it's very easy to miss the sign for the place from the road.  The other restaurant's signage dominates it.  Parking was tight as most of the cars in the lot were SUVs (consider street parking during peak hours).  Get in and since it's a first time I just want to sample some chicken salad to go and come back for dine in if I like what I ate.  Problem is, a simple take-out order took 20 minutes.  I understand restaurants operate on the FIFO system when it comes to orders (first in, first out) but someone looking to take out a scoop shouldn't have to wait that long.  Why not have some salad already packed in containers in a refrigerated case somewhere for purchase?  What that means then is because I'm waiting so long for this chicken salad when I can easily walk into Harris Teeter and pick some up without the wait is that this chicken salad better be the best damn chicken salad I ever ate.  Instead it's just meh.  I had the harvest.  Honestly comparing it to a similar chicken salad I've had, I would give the edge to that place of culinary excellence known as Subway.  Yes the chicken salad they roll out every once in a while was slightly more to my liking than this more expensive version.  The place does have a nice feel to it- think of it as hipster Cracker Barrel- and the help was friendly to avoid the one star review.  I sense this place has gotten a rep for one of those places in Charlotte you just have to check it out.  Think about that for a second.  We're talking about a place that serves chicken salad- not pizza, wings, burgers, burritos, etc.- as a must visit.  Really?  I mean nothing against chicken salad but it's not exactly the type of food one associates which going out of their way to get their best of.  And it's not like it's that hard to make your own.  See why I gave this the over-rated label now?  Good.  But just to drive the point home and counter the other reviewer- \"THIS PLACE IS NOT A MUST GO!\"",

    "text": "I love niche restaurants. The kind that basically do one thing, and do it well. I used to live in NYC and they're all over the place. It's nice to see a business like this open in Charlotte.  Chicken salad FTW.  The Mayobird is oozing with charm - the farmhouse theme really works here, and it is such a pleasant atmosphere for a casual meal. If you read my review of The Summit Room (The Mayobird's sister-restaurant which semi-shares the space and is only open for dinner), you'll know I wasn't crazy about the decor. I think the style just works better as a breakfast / lunch spot, in my opinion.  Both times I've been for lunch it has been packed - but the service was relatively fast and the staff are very friendly. You order at the counter and food is delivered to your table. The chicken salad is good. Maybe not my favorite of all time, but good. It's on the dry side, which personally I enjoy - I'm not crazy about mayo dripping all over the place. You can tell its freshly made with natural ingredients - a plus.  I've tried the Big Bird (curry) and the Harvest (apples, grapes, and pecans) and prefer the Harvest.  They also have some more unique flavors like loaded baked potato and buffalo chicken.  The homemade pita chips that come on the side are also quite tasty. The only drawback is that the price is a bit steep, and they really get you on the drinks - $2.50 for a fountain drink is pushing the boundary on value.",

I met a friend there for lunch and had a truly delightful experience!   First, there is FREE parking -which is a big deal along East Blvd! The location is easy to find, and the building is relatively easy to get in and out of during the lunch rush.   The interior has a trendy/shabby chic vibe that was super inviting. There are several couches and tables of different sizes to accommodate different sized parties. After we took in the general ambiance, my friend and I walked up to the counter and spent about 10 minutes weighing our options because the menu had so many fabulous and creative chicken salad options!   My friend ordered the chicken pot pie, which she was kind enough to let me sample -it was the best pot pie I've ever had! I ordered the Heater Health Nut, which is a jalapeno chicken salad served on a house salad. The Heater chicken salad was spicy enough to have a good kick without being so overpoweringly spicy that you couldn't enjoy the flavor of the food. I also want to make note of the tea; I'm not a True southerner and was raised drinking unsweet tea (blasphemy, I know)... in addition to serving fabulous chicken salad concoctions, Mayorbird makes a mean fresh brewed unsweet iced tea!   I can't wait to go back and try another one of Mayobird's chicken salad concoctions!",

The Mayobird might have amazing chicken salad (I wouldn't know, I've never eaten lunch here), but I actually know and love it as a coffee shop. Service is friendly and helpful, and I really love their connection to the Behailu Academy in NoDa.",

For lunch I like to mix it up but probably lean toward The Buffalo, Harvest or Colonel Mustard the most. Sit in the back by the fireplace on a cold day or on the rocking chairs on the front on a nice day! Treat yourself to a rice krispy treat (shaped like a birds nest).",

Nice variety of deserts and Coca Cola is not to sweet was a perfect finish to go with a perfectly made iced coffee.  Nice atmosphere, you order at the counter and the bring to you, table markers are wooden numbered spoons.  Tasted great and they do food truck..... awesome",

    "text": "Maybe I should have looked into this before I went to Mayobird, but I didn't realize they only had chicken salad. I'm not the biggest fan of chicken salad, but they did have a large selection of different kinds - including some without mayo, which was ideal for me since I'm not a mayo fan. With that being said, I thought the food was decent, but was a little overpriced for what I actually received. I purchased 3 \"sliders\", which was just under $9 and didn't include any sides. Call me a pig, but I was still a little hungry after the 3 sliders.   My review may not be that valuable since I'm not big on chicken salad, but nonetheless, here it is.",

The staff is super friendly and there are many dining room tables that serve as space for people to meet and work with wi-fi. I ordered a croissant and was a bit disappointed by the fact that it seemed microwaved (?). It was chewy and a little tough on the edges, albeit warm when I received it. The orange juice has a TON of pulp so I imagine that it's fresh-squeezed.   To make a full judgement call, I will have to come back for lunch soon. The patio would be enough to send me back here on a warmer day.",

It's like dessert..  The ice maker runs out quickly but it's understandable because people love the crushed ice. The servers are ALWAYS so friendly and funny. I love the staff, especially the guy with the cool dreads. He will keep your group laughing! So friendly and a hard worker. This place fills up quickly so it is sometimes hard to find a seat but I just discovered that you are able to eat on the other side of the restaurant.. phew.. what a relief. Love this place.. a must go!!",

    "text": "This place is just adorable and the food is good to back up the charming decor which is the most important part!  I've been twice now and have tried 4 different kinds of the chicken salad.  First time I had to try the Southern with pickles and eggs on that ridiculous sounding hot, buttered, toasted roll.  The roll really was great but that wasn't my favorite chicken salad, however my side of macaroni salad was perfect, if you like a mayo mac salad.  This most recent trip I went with sliders to try a few different kinds of the chicken salads.  I went with buffalo, harvest with the grapes and apples and nuts, and the loaded with bacon and sour cream.  And again had to have the macaroni salad.  All three were really tasty but if I have to pick a favorite I think its the harvest.  The grapes really add a nice light touch.  My one minor complaint, and I might be in the minority here, I could use a bit more mayo in the chicken salad.  Or maybe if they put it on the bread that would help.  I am sure if I ask for it they will be happy to oblige, because that's another thing, the staff is incredibly nice and helpful!  Happy to help with an order selection, happy to come help clear tables, the way they greet customers and wish you well on your way out, these are just friendly people!  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is I do think the prices can add up a bit quick and before you know it you have a $15 lunch on your hands.  But as long as its not my daily lunch spot I can deal with that for a quality spot with some delicious grub every now and then.",
