    "text": "We recently went here for dinner because we saw that it got great reviews on Yelp and trip advisor, however, I beg to differ. We had dinner reservations for 5, we showed up a little early and it was about 32 degrees outside and they absolutely did not open their doors until 5pm sharp. They unlocked the front door but did not open the doors for us, so we let ourselves in. The waitstaff is all male, they are extremely sarcastic and rude. One of the waiters knocked my mothers purse off her chair and did not apologize. Our waiter was very rude and sarcastic probably shouldn't be in the restaurant business. The way menu is set up they want you to order an anti pasta, primi then second, or three meals essentially. Each meal ranges from $25-$35, so If you order the way they suggest you're looking at $80-$100 a person. The portion sizes are \"European\" or what we would consider kid size portions. A side salad cost $13 and it was 5 little pieces of lettuce it was a joke. They were all out of Pinot noir and most beers? I ordered the Roasted Eggplant Ravioli which was $22, the food took 45 minutes to come out and there was a measly 5 ravioli on my plate (what a joke)! If you want my honest opinion, save your money and go to a less expensive restaurant with bigger portion sizes, this place was ridiculous!",

    "text": "This was one of the best dining experiences my wife and I have had in Charlotte, and we have both lived here for about twenty years. We went during restaurant week for our one year anniversary so we really got to explore the menu and taste several dishes. The grilled octopus appetizer was the most tender I've ever had. My grouper and risotto entree was perfectly cooked and very well seasoned. My wife had what we thought was going to be a caprese salad but turned out to be a very refreshing cold heirloom tomato soup (almost like a gazpacho) with fresh mozzarella, a basil leaf and focaccia bread croutons. It was delicious. Her eggplant and ricotta manicotti was excellent too. It wasn't covered in melted mozzarella and not smothered in chunky, overly-flavored tomato sauce like other places do, which really let the pasta, delicate sauce, and filling stand out on this one. Desserts were homemade and light, and a perfect end to the not overly filling meal, accompanied by an espresso to keep the night going! The plating and presentation was top notch. You can tell the chefs put all their effort and passion into each dish and do not let any plate leave the kitchen that is not up to Chef Grigo's standards. It was a nice surprise to see Chef Grigo come out to the dining area and slice the prosciutto on the carving station to prepare the meat and cheese platters. He even carved us each a slice to try since he caught my wife watching him work. The fact that there are only about 8 tables in the restaurant allows for an intimate or small group dinner with great service. I highly recommend everyone give this place a try.",

    "text": "Wooohooo I won a free meal voucher from Yelp's 2015 Charlotte Restaurant Week giveaway to Aqua e Vino so I was super excited to try this place out. Free food is basically my favorite thing ever.   Making a reservation was a bit of a process. I am a spoilt millennial and it has been ages since I made reservations without an online option. It took 3 calls but we finally snagged a Sunday night reservation (they are not typically open Sunday but made an exception for restaurant week).   Basically as soon as I received the certificate I eagerly pulled up their menu. I was bamboozled by that amount of unfamiliar Italian words so I did extensive googling before we reached the restaurant. Turns out all the wait staff were happy to answer questions on the menu. They provided complimentary bread and marinara sauce which were both delicious.   I started with the Bresaola Cornet which was my first time eating bresaola and robiola cheese and they made a completely delicious combo! The boyfriend was adventurous and ordered the Fritto Piemontese - sweet bread, polenta, sausage, apple. I had never had sweet bread before either and the sample I had was interesting and tasted better when combined with the apple. The sausage was amazing!   For the main I ordered the Catch of the Day \"Pesce Al Cartoccio\" which was a tropical fish I had never heard of. It came wrapped in the parchment sheet it was baked in. This was a novel experience and I am still unaware of the proper way to unwrap a meal. The fish was good but a bit dry but the vegetables baked under it had a great flavor.   For dessert he ordered the mixed berry tart and I had the Pesche Farcite both of which were excellent. The entire meal was an adventure of new tastes and everything was wonderful. We will definitely return!",

Chef Gabrielle is a perfectionist both in his preparation and service.  The restaurant is intimate and comforting with a bit of romance.  Gabe's approach to food is to use the best quality with no more than several ingredients per dish.  Perfection through simplicity!   Service is personal and excellent.

This is sometimes hard to find . We made a reservation for 5pm on the same day, i recommend doing this as it is a very small and intimate space, you want to call ahead. Once we arrived we were warmly welcomed by The hostess and accommodated by Franco. The place was clean and smelled divine. Italian tunes were playing in the background and  Franco spoke fluent Italian as well as the owner/chef! The chef came out to greet is personally, by this time we were the only people in the restaurant. He brought out his meats and cheese tray and started the most beautiful charcuterie I've ever experienced, he cut everything to perfection and in perfect proportions! Meanwhile Franco delivered our freshly baked bread basket composed of a mix of focaccia bread, Grissini and home bread! Just delicious ! Then another small bread basket my husband and I were fighting over this.  Then he asked us what we wanted and I asked him to surprise us! Did he ever!! He came out with a triple treat of pasta, risotto and kale pasta plates. They were all delicious, each with its own carefully crafted flavor I cannot tell you a favorite as they were all magnificent. I will just upload my pictures as this is so hard to express but pictures are a different story We also had the best coconut cake dessert, one of 3 he served us. Just magnificent. To top it off we got to meet the chefs wife who was absolutely delightful! This was he lost intimate lovely dinner I have ever experienced and my hubby and I were in awe at the family atmosphere, I felt as if I was back home in Milano! I'm a happy girl",

The donuts were more savory than sweet, but good.   The wine list @ Aqua e Vino is extensive (hence the namesake?) and I ordered a glass or two of red. We shared the Octopus as an appetizer and, for my main meal, I ordered the Salmon w/ butternut squash.  My food was well cooked and presented well. I consider Aqua e Vino a \"pretty food\" restaurant with relatively small portions, hearty prices, and a smallish menu. It feels like a special night out restaurant and you could see and taste the chef's talents. I didn't 'love' the hard bread personally (which is probably an authentic Italian restaurant bread choice) but I don't need the extra bread anyway. :)  Great place for a special night or date.

It was amazing, the prosciutto was hand carved right in front of us and the cheese was served with fig, honey and I believe an apricot marmalade.  We were both so happy with our selection but sad that we were getting full.  Instead of skipping dinner, we opted to split a plate of gnocchi.  I can only say it was gnocchi love.  The wine selections were also fabulous and we opted for a bottle of Italian.  The atmosphere, food and attentive staff made this evening such a wonderful evening.  We definitely will be back to try more of the amazing food & wine, plus take in the atmosphere of this quaint place.",

I think they have a small staff and a small kitchen, however you would also think with a small number of tables you would have a lot of attention. Not the case. So if you do go, plan on at least a 2 hour dinner.  The food is amazing, just be prepared to wait.",

For example, the (average-sized) caprese salad was $35 and certainly nothing special. The atmosphere was nice but the staff weren't especially friendly or helpful.

    "text": "Better late than never...how could I have forgotten to write about you Aqua e Vino??!!!  Used to be they had Antipasto and Primi on Tuesdays for $35 per person. This has been replaced with the Butta Pasta program Tuesdays through Thursdays which offers Antipasto, 3 pasta dishes and dolce for $40 per person.  Aqua e Vino is small, quaint and warm - great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or have a long dinner talking with friends. I took my journey with John, Tonya and my lovely wife (bonus points).  For Antipasto/Appetizers we had the Beet Salad, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms Fritti, Grilled Octopus with Artichokes and Capers, and the Cauliflower flan. All of them were great in their own way but the Cauliflower flan was warm, creamy and unexpectedly wonderful: like baby food/comfort food for grown-ups!  For Primi we had the Gnocchi Bolognese, Shrimp Risotto and Mahi over Black Rice. We all took bites and then changed plates until everyone had a portion. Solid dishes all around but the homemade sauces like the Bolognese really stand out!  The best part - I repeat the best part was dessert! Whoever makes the pastries here has some major skill!! When they brought the dessert tray, we pretty much ordered everything. Chocolate and Hazelnut Torte, Lemon Meringue Tart, Semifreddo with Hazelnut Pralines, Pear Tart and last but not least, my favorite, Apricot and Marzipan Tart!! Seriously, they were all simply amazing!  Sorry for taking so long A e V but hopefully it was worth the wait!!!",

    "text": "Belated New Years Review  Work has been chaotic since we got back from New Years since our employees have been decimated by the flu. Falling a bit behind on reviews but finally getting caught up.  Before my wife left for Pittsburgh to see her daughter, I ran across something under Yelp Events that looked interesting. It was for a Prix Fixe dinner at Aqua e Vino on New Years Eve. Actually it was for two different ones. The  first was an early one with four courses that started at 6 pm and a second larger one that started at 9 pm and lasted till Midnight aka New Years.  Considering the distance to Cornelius and not wanting to be out on the road around New Years, we chose the 6 pm flight.  Even though I hit the  \"I'm in\" response button, was not sure that was going to work so I called for reservations the following week. They are closed on Monday so that did not work and ended up leaving a voice mail the next day. Telephone tag and we finally connected and nailed it down.  Wife returns from Pittsburgh the day before and after experiencing hours of driving in a white out, was looking to a nice quiet night out.  New Years Eve arrived and after watching the Panthers Game which ended at exactly the right time, we left and drove down to Aqua e Vino. Due to construction on I-77 we had budgeted extra time but ended up arriving about 15 minutes early.  No problem. Our hosts could not have been more gracious and seated us at our assigned table and brought us water and asked if we wanted any thing to drink.  Upgraded to a nice sparkling water which was good.  This gave us a chance to survey the restaurant. Small and I would guess it probably seats around 30 or so patrons. Intimate and somewhat romantic but my wife would tell me, I'm too old for that. Very pleasant atmosphere and could enjoy the restaurant just because of the atmosphere.  The appointed hour of 6 arrived and while folks started to trickle in, the started to serve those who were there. Made for a bit uneven serving on the part of the staff but they did a great job adjusting.  Did notice that most of the patrons were regulars since everyone knew each other.  Everyone started out with a glass of Champagne and of course, a toast to the New Year.  The Antipasto came first and we had a choice of three.  One was House Cured Arctic Char (misspelled chard on the menu) and buckwheat  blinis; another was homemade foie gras \"au torchon\", porto gelee, baby greens and croutons. The last was raviolone, spinach,sheet ricotta, egg surprise, parmigiano butter and perigord truffle.  My wife ordered the Char and I ordered the foie gras.  Both of which were excellent. As for the foie gras, great texture and great balance of various flavors.  For the Primo or First Course, it was the same for all and was an enhanced Risotto with aged Parmigiano and While Truffle Lamelle.  Again excellent although I do like my Risotto a bit softer with a creamier texture but great blend on taste.  For the Secundi or  Second Course, again a choice. My wife and I both ordered the Grass Fed Beef Tenderloin with Mushroom Farcie, Maidera Glaze and Perigord Truffle . The other choice was a poached Wild Sea Bass and Lobster.  The other choice sounded great as well but the tenderloin was outstanding. Great taste and texture and presentation was outstanding.  Finally was Dolce or Desert which was a Classic Vanilla Souffle served with a hot Chocolate Sauce on the side.  Simple dish but in that is the secret to it's elegance.  Had to wait a bit for the Chocolate Sauce to cool down but it was a perfect compliment to the Souffle. A perfect end to the meal.  Perfect way to ring in the New Year.  Great Food in a Cozy Atmosphere with great Service.  If they have it available next year, will probably make a point of trying it again",

Basics: must call to make a reservation, and they take a credit card to hold your reservation and threaten to charge it if you don't cancel and don't show up. I called at 11 on a Tuesday for a party of five on that Thursday. When we went on Thursday, all thirty seats were filled (five of them from us, thankfully).   Food: we had the cauliflower flan, spanish octopus, and a special grilled goat cheese with bread to start.  They come up with these delightful bread-donuts (I think they call them Neopolitan beignets) that you dip in a bright, simple marinara, and a bread basket of delicious, olive-oil and salt-heavy breads.  Everything here goes great with wine- rich salty food, but small portions. The octopus was my favorite, so tender; my husband adored the subtlety and unusualness of the cauliflower flan, so delicate and very custard-like.  Tasted like the middle of a quiche to me. The goat cheese was a huge hit too.  Next we had the PASTAS. I didn't even think I liked pasta but now I can't stop thinking about the incredible dense, springy, chewy, delicious pasta that came with the white duck bolognese.  Husband adored the tortelli filled with butternut squash, a hint of amaretto, and served with butter-sage sauce. And the gnocchi were soft perfect pillows.  And even better, everything came in reasonable small portions!  Then we had the branzino, which came with incredible mandonlined potatoes which had soaked up all these delicious fish-oil-sauce-flavor, and the venison (quail was out) with brussel sprouts and potatoes.  The venison was again, extremely tender.  Finally finished with three of the tarts, which they bring out on a dessert platter.  We picked lime meringue, apricot-marzipan, and coconut.  All were delightful.  The chef came by to say hello and check on us.  Service was impeccable.  Just... great.  We'll definitely be back for every special occasion.  And they gave us some Moscato for my mother-in-law's birthday.  Absolutely a must-go. We got away with $50 a head, but brought our own wine.  Definitely the best Italian food I've ever had.",

The evening starts with some amazing rolls with marinara, followed by charcuterie, then three pastas served family style and desserts.  From the minute we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Drink orders were taking and an overview of the evening was provided. We decided to take advantage of the family style meal. We started with charcuterie, which included several meats and cheeses, some olives and breads. The selections were amazing, loved every bite. On to the pasta! From the menu, we selected the Fregola with Clams, Pappardelle with Duck Ragu and Gnocchi. All were amazing, but the Pappardelle with the Duck Ragu was my favorite! You can tell the pasta is homemade, and the accompaniments were cooked to perfection, all served piping hot. To top the evening off we enjoyed a platter of desserts, which included a chocolate cake, berry layered cake, coconut cake and homemade whipped cream. A perfect way to end the evening!  I cannot stop thinking about the meal, and cannot wait to return. Reservations are definitely recommended as this is an intimate atmosphere with a small setting. So, definitely consider next time you are craving an amazing Italian dinner for a special event. Aqua e Vino is worth it!",

    "text": "Okay, I tried to call, but I received a recorded message. So I'm reviewing you now. If I could give less than a star I would. First, remove the porcini mushroom appetizer immediately. Chain restaurants have better fried mushrooms. The dish is an insult at $15.00. The most annoying  by far was our server. He was condescending and had a complete lack of knowledge of the menu. I don't know what happened. We went to the same restaurant last year for our anniversary and returned because of the great food and service. Once again, Charlotte and this establishment has failed to impress. At $150 for two people, never again. I called today and spoke with the owner/chef. The reason I didn't ask to speak to someone last night is simple. I didn't want a scene in a small restaurant. When I spoke to the owner his reply was, \"Well if you didn't like the food, why didn't you ask to speak to me?\" Not, I apologize for your experience, I would like to comp your meal. Instead I got a lecture about how I was in the wrong and clearly had no taste, because he sells a lot of those greasy mushrooms. By the way, the waiter never once asked how our meal was. So they you have it.",

    "text": "Still drooling thinking about the dinner I had last night at AQUA e VINO.  We had had this place ear-marked for the longest time and the universe finally aligned so that we could meet and enjoy this place.  First off... if you rely on your GPS, the address for the restaurant is a bit wonky and you will end up behind it.  The key is to just park on either end (Fresh Market parking lot or the lot in front of Red Rocks) and then wander into the small alley to find the entrance to AQUA e VINO.  Really intimate space, but still warm and relaxed.  Our server was very friendly and we started a great meal with some bubbles.  She did know the menu very well as we peppered her with questions and recommendations.  Since it was Tuesday, they do a $35 Antipasti & Primi (or Secondi) with a dessert.  Our group ended up going this route and then we played \"pass the plate\" clockwise to try a little bit of everything.  I ordered the octopus appetizer and house made gnocchi.  We ended our meal with so many pastries and the delicious semifredo.  Overall the experience was a great one.  There was a large table (8) that were celebrating a birthday that night.  With how small the restuarant was, it was hard not so jump in and sing the birthday celebrant into a new year. We all left with lots of laughs and a ton of pictures of food that I'll be thinking about for a long long time.",

    "text": "Phenomenal, amazing, wonderful. Can't come up with sufficient superlatives. Absolutely the best northern Italian- real Italian, not \"American Italian\"- in Charlotte, and for me the best and finest restaurant experience in Charlotte period, without question. There's a reason it's packed to the rafters with regulars for every seating, every night it's open.   Chef Gabriele is phenomenally talented, yet manages to present food that is authentically \"home\", from his native region of northern Italy. I've been eating here for two years, since just after the restaurant opened, and have never had a meal or a dining experience that wasn't perfect. Chef treats you like family, and while he certainly  appreciates the regular customers, he's also welcoming to new diners. This is a very special experience, with very competent staff who know their business and work hard; they also get to know their customers and do treat regulars accordingly, so don't be surprised to hear wait staff speaking familiarly with the customers at the next table. Everyone becomes friends and family here.    A few things to point out, if you're a first time customer:  The restaurant is very small, with maybe 40 covers total per seating, so there isn't much wiggle room for the staff if a table decides to relax and have another bottle of wine... it's not the restaurant's fault if diners take a little extra time to finish their meal, so there may sometimes be a short wait for a table to open, even with a reservation, but it's rare.   It's very hard to get seated as a walk-in most nights, so a reservation is most definitely recommended.   There's virtually no space inside the restaurant to wait if you're there early, so you may have to stand outside for a bit. The patio is lovely and it's nice outside. Enjoy it. The food and experience will be more than worth it.    And yes, this is most definitely a True European restaurant, with exquisitely prepared food in portions planned for multiple courses, so if you're looking for one huge portion of pasta, red sauce on everything, lots of beer, a kid's menu, or a salad the size of a shoebox, turn left instead of right and go across the patio to Red Rocks and enjoy it. They're nice too, just a different experience.   You'll never find better prepared food in Charlotte than Aqua E Vino. Not anywhere. Go once and try it. Go twice. Go every week. Get to know your server. Be patient; it's an intimate restaurant, and the food is prepared just for you. Get to know the chef... ask Gabriele to come out and talk about the preparation of a dish. He will be happy to talk to you if it's not crazy busy. You can't go wrong at this place; I'd eat there every night if I could. Absolutely wonderful in every way.",
