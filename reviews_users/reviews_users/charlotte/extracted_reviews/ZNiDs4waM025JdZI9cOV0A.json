The bread was good, but it's the same bread you get at Customshop (and we had to ask for it, after our meal had already arrived). In short, there are so many other great options in Charlotte for fresh pasta, with more reasonable prices. Bummed, but we probably won't be back any time soon.",

Got the Hangar Steak and the Lemon/Lamb pasta (which is AMAZING) along with the shrimp ceviche. Every bite of food we had was good. I see people complaining about the price, but our food and a bottle of wine plus a beer came in under $120. Again, that's an average date night tab. I'd suggest sitting at the bar and watching the fresh pasta being made in front of you. Definitely heading back soon!",

The awkward entrance was not planned out well and there isn't any standing room, especially waiting for the hostess. I figured he or she would be back shortly so I waited. I watched what was going on and saw a large group that had been sitting and drinking at the bar get up when their table was ready. I saw a couple walk up to the bar and sit down and the bartender said \"yeah these seats are for reservations only\" but the previous group was just sitting at the bar drinking which made no sense. The couple said oh I'm sorry I just saw the group before me drinking here so I thought it was ok? She just shrugged and said \"these are for reservations only\" the couple got up and walked out and so did we. When we left they said \"we tried coming here when it first opened and the hostess was super rude to us and we thought it was just a fluke--now we wanted to try it again and clearly nothing has changed.\" Never saw a hostess the entire 10 minutes I stood there, no one greeted us. The restaurant was crowded and loud and extremely dark. Food better be good with service like that.",

Ordered a bottle of wine she kept behind the bar  and it was almost impossible to get her attention to refill our empty glasses.  The bread they bring out is fabulous!    The burrata was very good.    The Pasta was disappointing.   It was heavy, overcooked, and tasteless.    Even the shrimp was tough.    The prices are too high for the quality of food or service.

The burrata did not come with bread or crackers, so it was a bit awkward to eat.  For 3 cocktails and 1 cold, stiff, mound of mozerrella, the tab was $60.

The dining room is very open with lots of big windows, and having the kitchen right in the center makes you feel like you're eating in someone's kitchen. We tried a few things on the menu: the cheese board, mushrooms, and spinach capriccio (their menu seems to change a lot so not sure how long these will be available). I was not 100% thrilled with the size of the cheese board for the price you pay (3 1-2oz chunks of cheese and 3 spreads for $18), but the spreads were all homemade and the cheeses were great! As someone who does not love mushrooms, I enjoyed this plate. Very unique take on mushrooms as they almost taste like a full, tangy salad with all the seasonings and sauce. The pasta was absolutely to die for! Obviously hand crafted with a delicious red sauce on top. The portions are small, but the cost is well worth it for the deliciousness of the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant!",

    "text": "Fantastic, start to finish.  Stopped into Flourshop last night, and we couldn't have enjoyed our meal more.   Started with the Coal Roasted Squash, which was great.  The creaminess of the ricotta and the brightness of the pesto were both a very nice complement to the squash...Only complaint was the toast could've been a bit softer.   Shrimp ceviche was an atypical version, but still very good nonetheless.  Cool dish on a very hot night.   We then moved into pasta, with the gnocchi/pork sugo.  Light, yet somehow hearty and substantial, the size almost reminiscent of gnudi.  Gnocchi can be a gummy mess if not done well...not the case here, very nicely constructed.  This feels like a dish for those that truly appreciate how temperamental this pasta can be...very nice.  We closed out the meal with the Halibut special...tomato brodo, chorizo,  sweet corn with perfectly al dente orecchiette.  Tremendous.  Also a nice touch, we ordered a couple of glasses of an off-the-run white wine, and our server tried a smidge to make sure that it was still just-right (it was...very delicious).   Very happy that we went, Flourshop is a perfect addition to the Back Lot, and we can't wait to go back.  If you appreciate well-executed technique (it's not 'just pasta' as others have noted...smh), balanced/inventive flavors, in a laid back atmosphere, this is for you.",

In a nutshell, it was one of the most disappointing experiences in Charlotte's 2018 new restaurants.  The restaurant ambience was inviting but the food was low quality and grossly overpriced for appetizer-sized portions.    Sashimi Tuna appetizer $16  (it was six dime-sized thin pieces of tuna with cucumbers.)   Gemelli Sausage $22, it seriously tasted like processed meat out of a can.   Squid Ink Linguine w/ Crab $28, you can neither see nor taste the crab but the linguine was not bad.    Barbecued Spanish Octopus $28, it was seriously two little octopus tentacles about one inch long each with beans and a piece of bread.  One of the pieces was stale and not cut so it was like chewing on a piece of rubber band.     Tuscan wine $39, this was refreshingly good (because they didn't make it).",

Arrived about 8 pm on a Friday evening and it looked very business as we circled the parking lot trying to find a space. Walked in and was greeted by the hostess. I asked about seats at the bar and she said they were 1st come 1st serve. The wait was about 45 minutes for a table for 2. Twos ears opened at the bar immediately so we grabbed them. Bartender greeted us pretty quickly giving us menus. The bar is facing the kitchen so you get to see all the action. It was fun to watch the guy make pasta. He was at it the whole time we were there.  They have a nice wine selection, a few select cocktails, beer and also a full bar. I ordered a glass of Kuleto--a Winery I have been to in Napa. I wish I could remember the exact names of the items we ordered, or had taken a picture of the menu. Nonetheless I ordered one of the pasta dishes that was fettuccine with oxtail and mushrooms. The mushrooms were the hit of the woods which I love and they had great flavor. A pasta dish was amazing. They also served warm bread. They have not yet added a dessert menu which the bartender said was coming soon. Ironically they had baked cookies for that night's service but they had burned them so they didn't have anything to offer for dessert. I would definitely return, and would recommend if you're coming with a group make a reservation, or plan on a wait and enjoy a glass of wine or cocktail on their exterior patio.",

Unfortunately, despite our enthusiasm and easygoing nature we were served by a inattentive, lethargic server Ashleigh. This particular night had a modest amount of guests with no wait time and several open tables. Regardless of the slow traffic and relatively unoccupied serving staff, Ashleigh visited our table infrequently and left us waiting 30 minutes for our check. Meanwhile, we tried many times to gather her attention. My recommendations are to seat somewhere outside of her section to enjoy the full experience.",

    "text": "We had a great experience at Flour Shop, the one downside being that our table was right by the door that kept opening and closing, letting cold air in. Any other table would've been better.   That said, the food was amazing. After drinks, we had the shrimp ceviche (great flavors but I would try something else next time) and then ordered the ricotta raviolini and lemon fettuccine. The pasta was SO GOOD. After tip, our bill was just over $100. This is a great date spot if you don't mind that it's not quiet, spacious, or intimate. Don't bring your kids. I give it 5 stars because I like the set-up, the bar around the kitchen, etc....and the food was just that good.",

    "text": "This place was an amazing gourmet dining experience!  From the moment we walked in, I knew there was something special about this restaurant. The place was bustling with activity and people. There was not an empty table in the house, so we sat at the bar.  I loved the open kitchen design, and even though they were swamped with customers, the servers and cooks were always very attentive. While we waited for first meal, we tried one of their interesting house cocktails. I got the Barrel-Aged Black Manhattan.  It was so good that I wanted to try all of them! I wanted some fresh vegetables so I started with the Cucumbers & French Beans. Seemingly simple, but their spin on it was something I never expected. The cucumbers and beans were incredibly fresh and crunchy, full of flavor. The homemade buttermilk sauce was so good that we used some bread to clean the plate.  Next we tried the Carolina Shrimp & Crab Ceviche. I thought the Cucumbers & French Beans were good, but the Ceviche was out of this world! They had little red peppers on the plate that burst with a uniquely sweet and peppery flavor. I've never had anything like them before. We split the Squid Ink Linguine a la Chitarra. We paired it with one of their delicious reds, the Ca'De Calle 'Gran Riserva.'  Again, the flavors were complex and delicious. It was a lot of food and we probably should've stopped here, but I was dying to try their pork chop! Lastly, we had the Lady Edison Pork Chop. The horseradish potatoes were ingenius and the Porkchop was cooked to perfection, seared and juicy. We had the opportunity to meet one of the chefs, Chad. He told us about the dishes and I could tell that he was proud of the work they did.  You can truly taste the difference in the food when the employees are passionate about the product they serve. I would definitely go back here!",

The lamb bolognese fettuccine was delicious! Definitely can tell how fresh the pasta is. While some may say the portions are small, I actually had plenty for leftovers the following day.

    "text": "I follow The Charlotte Agenda pretty closely and was very excited to try this new restaurant because...pasta. I went with two friends and arrived around 7:30pm. We waited about 30 mins or so for a table and ordered drinks and desert (wonderful oatmeal raisin cookies) to get us started. Once seated we ordered 4 appetizers: Coal-Roasted Butternut Squash, Carolina Shrimp Ceviche, Grilled UFG Mushrooms, and A5 Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. The appetizers were WONDERFUL. Next up we ordered the Pappardelle, Lemon Bucatini and the Squid Ink Linguine a la Chitarra. The pastas were great, but the flavor profiles were very intense. The Lemon Bucatini was almost too strong and rich to eat. The Pappardelle and the Squid Ink pastas were definitely better, but also strong. We ate every morsel of our appetizers and lost steam on the pastas, but enjoyed the meal overall. Hands down my favorite item was the Carolina Shrimp Ceviche. I love Ceviche and eat it a lot so it's pretty major when I say that this one may be my all time favorite. I'll definitely be going back to work my way through the rest of the menu.",

However it turns out that the bar is not a technical first come first serve bar. Seats are controlled by the hostess so all reserved. You are not allowed to stand at the bar and order a drink from a bartender, in fact we were reprimanded twice for standing too close to the bar. There is no designated area to stand if you are waiting so we stood awkwardly by the door for over an hour. It genuinely seemed like no one has thought through the concept of comfortably accommodating patrons waiting for a table.   There were no food standouts. A very small cheese board - we asked what accompanied it on the plate and waiter said \"I don't know they just start put stuff on the plate when we run out of what's supposed to be on there\".   Pasta was average. Food prices are very high. Wine by the glass prices are higher.   I really hope they work these problems out. Designate an area for customers who are waiting (and paying to drink). Kick up the food and service game for those prices.",

Bacon wrapped figs, good but not juicy, a bit over cooked .... my wife's bib salad was excellent, great flavors, fresh. My main, scallops and pork belly, the scallops were cooked very well but the pork belly was overdone in my opinion, I love pork belly that melts in your mouth not that get a crispy bacon top. And the portion seamed small. The succotash begins were over cooked and greasy.  Bread pudding interesting . My main disappointment was that the food at the Custom Shop seems so inspired and this did not. It was not at al a bad dinner, just not special. And I will go back.",

Both were tasty, I think the burrata was the favorite overall. A couple of us ordered the Squid Ink Pasta, which seems to be a favorite.  It does have a kick, but was a bit salty - overall it was good though and I would probably get it again.   I would probably go back, but I don't know that it will become a 'go-to'. Also, small thing, but they only have paper straws, which is fine, but if you serve frozen drinks - paper straws aren't useful. If you want to be sustainable, maybe get some metal straws for beverages.",

The menu features fresh pasta and innovative dishes, all without a single chicken or beef selection. Thoughtful and diverse wine and cocktail selection.  Focaccia bread was nice.   The squid ink pasta dish had an undisclosed spicy arrabbiata sauce that overpowered the king crab meat flavor. The ricotta ravioli was good. It was interesting. But not great. The kale chips were a nice compliment of flavors and texture. The lemon zest was also a nice compliment but there was too much of it. So, basically the verdict is the flavors are mostly nice but some balancing of the flavors needs to take place in order to give the food the four stars I think the chef is aiming for and capable of.   We felt the pricing was a bit high, but I probably wouldn't mention it if the food was great rather than just good.   I look forward to some tweaks making this place a great neighborhood eatery.",

    "text": "We walked in and sat at the bar and were immediately brought menus by the host and greeted by the bar staff and drink orders taken.  All of the staff we sounded work were nice and focused.   Chairs at bar swivel which is helpful.  Hooks under the bar for purses.  Decor is simple, open kitchen with central bar all around it and tables around the windows.  I think there is a patio on the side but it was raining so not sure.  Close quarters, you can call it intimate if you like, but it's not romantic...the noise level is through the roof.  Not sure why they even have background music.... You only hear the bass once in a while. . Just turn it off and maybe it will be a little quieter... Or add some sound proofing. I got a little bit of a headache. I would think twice about going back just based on how loud it is.  The bar seating is ample (1st come) and good spots to watch the kitchen staff bring together all the plates from apps to wood-fired grill to stove to plating and garnish.  Great ventilation system and the kitchen itself is quiet.    The drink menu is interesting without being annoying.  Wine menu is solid but of course bottle pricing is ridiculous.  Menu is short which isn't a bad thing.  The Butternut Squash app was good and I do like that they allow the flavors to shine... But a little seasoning or extra spritz of additional flavor in that would have been nice.    On the pasta choices it seems the first two items after the name are the sauce with the third thing being a feature of the dish... For example; lamb/oxtail is a reduction sauce - no meat, the mushrooms are the feature (after the pasta). And it was delish!  Loved the lemon pasta with it, but the lady next to me thought the lemon was a bit much.   Shrimp special was good, but again just a little extra seasoning... Shrimp were slightly over but still a good dish.  I wanted to get the king crab squid ink but they couldn't leave out the chili peppers which I can't have... so the sauces are pre-made.  Portions are perfect.  I was just getting full with one or two bites left, but that's also why I think it's fairly pricey for what you get.  Speaking of pasta... How can you go wrong with fresh pressed/cut pasta?  I do like being able to see it made along with watching the whole kitchen.  I wonder how it is for the staff though...I guess they get to watch us too!  I saw the cookies at the end of the bar and asked what they were... The bartender said Snicker doodle but that's the only sweet they have.  Based on the pricing of the wine/food they should probably just bring you one at the end of the meal as a treat.  You know... I'd might eat there again but it's not a place I feel I have to go back and check out soon and, as others have noted... It's pasta!",

The steak my friend ordered was cooked correctly with the right amount of seasoning.  Make sure to make reservations. We came on a Wednesday night and it was packed. Parking can also be a little bit of an issue so plan for that.",

    "text": "There is no shortage of staff or yummy cocktails.  Some friends and I were going to DOT DOT DOT and they gave us an hour wait to get in.  We headed over to the Flour Shop to pre-game and well, it became our game.  We didn't even go to DOT DOT DOT because we had such a great time at the Flour Shop.  I had two of their custom cocktails... the Blackberry cocktail was my favorite!!  There were a lot of things happening in the kitchen from pasta making to wood burning oven cooking.  It was such a spectacular sight to behold.  I feel like there were a few guys behind the bar who were not dressed in the same style as everyone else, which indicated to me they were probably owners and were setting them apart from everyone else, or someone dropped the ball and left their staff uniform at home.  Ha.  Either way, everyone was super nice and it was very easy to get a drink at while standing at the bar.    The lighting and decor was simply phenomenal.  It really set the mood for a great night.  It wasn't too noisy that we couldn't speak to each other but the music playing in the background was a nice touch.  We didn't bother with food, we drank our calories.  Yum yum!     I'd say the extreme majority of patrons at this establishment were dressed to impress, so don't show up in jeans and a ratty t-shirt and expect to fit in.     Bathroom was clean and accessible.  Parking could be a bit of a challenge, but you can always park in the front of the plaza and walk through the garden cut-through by hardware store.    Check it out stat!",

For instance, the House-Made Burrata was served with one small meager piece of bread although the server mentioned it was enough for four.  For our table of nine, I would say five would not have ordered their's again and at $25+ per plate, we expected more. The atmosphere is average and certainly does not present the open kitchen concept we were anticipating.  Additionally, the restaurant was extremely warm. Finally, the service was below average. Plates were not cleared and it took a long time for dinner to be served...we were in the restaurant over 2 hours.",

I waited a entire year before I said ok it must be legit because it's still open. So last night my wife and I went to give it a try. What I'm so mad about is thatninwaited a year to give it a try.  Dam me.  Make sure you sit at the bar so you can see everything that is going on in the kitchen.  We started off with beef carpaccio and not your normal carpaccio and it was outstanding.  We moved to the penne pasta with the pork ragu and the noodles were perfectly aldente and the ragu was delicious. We then had the goat cheese stuffed kielbasa which was amazing.  The wine was great the service was quite good.  I asked about how the chef stuffs the sausage and he came over and spent a good 5 minutes with us explaining the different ways etc.  He even gave us 2 chorizo sausages to take home and cook for ourselves.  We will definitely be back.",

However, they lost me when it came to my Bucatini pasta. The pasta and shrimp were tough and the overly creamy pesto made the dish quite heavy. The apple empanada and ice cream was OK but nothing that stood out as worth it. I like the open kitchen feel and think it has plenty of potential but our dishes missed the mark. $105 with tip for dinner for 2. It just didn't seem worth the price tag. Next time just appetizers.",

    "text": "When I moved to Charlotte everyone told me to go to Flourshop. I was so excited about it because it's walking distance from my apartment but I also felt this strange anxiety because I felt like it wouldn't live up to the hype. My husband and I finally stopped in this weekend and I was so happy that it was about as good as we were hoping. We came in around 8:45 on a Saturday and honestly it wasn't too packed. They had a few tables open and a ton of bar seats, we opted to sit at the bar. Our server greeted us right away and told us about the specials. I ordered a red wine and my husband had a beer. The wine was very good for the price, I think $11. It was a generous pour and great quality, tart but tannic. We started with the jamon and the mussels special. The jamon was a nice plate with arugula, fava beans, bacon, and a vinaigrette. Typically we order jamon to eat with a bread but this was more of a deconstructed salad. Neither of us typically love arugula but this was delicious. It was salted nicely and also had slices of pear. It was the perfect balance of salty and sweet. The mussels were peppery but flavorful. They were cooked nicely and in a red pepper tomato-ish sauce. I can't explain it better than that but it was savory and wonderful. For our \"main\" dishes we had a short rib special and the strozzapreti, a pork sugo with butternut squash and dumpling-like pasta. The pasta dish was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat was flavorful and tender. The sweet butternut squash was a nice addition. The short rib unfortunately was a bit of a miss. The flavors were there, it really was a punch of flavor, but we didn't love the preparation. It was cooked on the bone and was just too overlooked and not tender-not what we typically expect when we think of short rib. Maybe some people prefer this preparation style but for us it just wasn't our favorite. I've heard people say the prices here are high for the portions, but I felt the portions were decent. Yes it's a little pricey, but it's a nice, NYC-style restaurant with a higher quality of food than some of the other restaurants in the area, so I think the prices are justified. It's the perfect spot for a date night and despite our one short rib issue, we had a great dinner and will absolutely be back.",

Pastas and breads are all made fresh in house and are amazing.  Wife and I have eaten here 3-4 times and haven't had a bad meal.

The waitress had a great wine suggestion and was spot on when I told her what I liked. The bread they give you is amazing, but on top of that we had the Burrata pesto dish to start, and it was delicious.  I had the Parmesan Gnocchi and the sauce was perfectly seasoned and the meatballs were to die for. The gnocchi was larger than I'd ever seen anywhere, so they were a little mushy, but still a great dish.  My date had the Rigatoni and raved about it. (we're pasta lovers).  Finished with the walnut/white chocolate cookie which actually was really good with the wine. Service was spot on as well.  My only complaint would be that the restaurant was a little warm, but I imagine with an open kitchen that's to be expected. Decor was clean and modern, and lots of windows for natural light. Also, I do wish there was a smidge more space between the tables, but still a great environment.  -Thanks for a great evening.",

The bread is literally the best bread I've ever had the pleasure of eating in my life. It MELTS in your mouth. It's fresh made everyday. The gnocchi is also this way-melty. It's so fresh and delicious. The pork meatballs: wonderful, perfect. Squid ink pasta: amazing, hint of spicy, hint of mint. And the burrata was light and airy.

We sat at the bar (which is definitely the way to do this place). The entire kitchen is open and you can watch all the action right there.   We started with dirty martinis. Our bartender brought us the homemade bread with oil. Definitely worth every carb. We ordered the scallop ceviche and housemade burrata to start. Both were delicious, the burrata was just perfect. For entrees, we shared the Squid Ink Linguini and the Ribeye. These were absolutely amazing. The ribeye was cooked perfect and full of flavor. I'd go back and order both of these again. And again. And again.  Two shared plates, two entrees, and four cocktails with a 20% tip was $169. Honestly, I thought it was a great price for the delicious meal and evening we had.  Service was great. I love the ambiance in here. It's perfect for a girls night or date night. Space is clean, bright, and inviting.  If you are anti-bar and dead set on a table, make sure to make a reservation.

Lemon fettuccine with mussels and ginger sausage. It took a REALLY long time to come out after the apps, and missed the mark. Flavor just wasn't there, at least for us.

    "text": "Great intimate Italian restaurant in Park Road shopping center. The menu has clearly been thought through as almost everything on it draws in your attentions we started with the Burrata, Dates, and Mushrooms. The burrata is delicious and soft with an herby pesto sauce that's drizzled over the cheese and toast. The plate is beautifully put together! The mushrooms are also delicious and worth getting. The dates are good and creative (wrapped in bacon and stuffed with blue cheese) but if you don't like blue cheese, then I'd pass on these. the bread in the beginning is also warm and covered in olive oil.  The rest of the menu is divided into pasta and main courses, all of which look great. The pasta clearly tastes fresh and handmade. I had the spicy meatballs with bucatini and it was the perfect portion to complement the small plates that we started with. Members of my group also had the hangar steak which was perfectly cooked and the linguini with mussels and sausage. Overall, the pasta itself sticks out the most from the pasta plates.  The cocktails were also fantastic and they have their own unique IPA brewed by Sycamore.  The only reason for the 4 stars as opposed to 5 is that we were very early in the night and our food still took quite a long time. Also, although meant for a special night out, you still might be a little disappointed by the price points on the menu for what you're getting. Compared to other nice charlotte restaurants, the prices should probably be a few dollars lower here. Still a great night out though and lots of great and creative dishes!",

    "text": "This was our second time visiting Flourshop and we were pretty pleased with what we had! The food was delicious, although it was a bit pricey for the starters. You definitely get a good amount of food entrees for the price though! Two people can definitely share a pasta dish or one of their woodfired entrees. The only downside was that when we went around 5 PM yesterday, the restaurant was extremely hot. We were sweating bullets .  I think this was because of the amount of windows (and the summer sun is so strong right now) and the fact that it is an open kitchen, you can feel all the flames. The AC was set to full blast but it didn't help much and just dropped water from the ceiling. Other than that, we had a good birthday dinner. Highly recommend the pistachio pasta and burrata!",

I had reservations and was quickly seated however, I can see the wait time could be long if reservations weren't made.  I was a little surprised there was no vegetarian options, per se, but we were able to take some sides listed for other entrees and make a vegetarian dish which turned out great.  The mashed/puree cauliflower and the squid ink linguini were the top two things I mostly remember.  Both were full of flavor and not something normally had.  The Brussels sprouts and hanger steak were good but...just good.  Well cooked but nothing to say much else about.  The way the kitchen is positioned you can see the staff making the pasta and rolling it through the pasta machine.  A nice little touch letting us know it actually is \"made in house\".",

We arrived shortly after 5:00pm on a Thursday night and decided to enjoy dinner at the bar, which allows you to enjoy the open kitchen...which is one of my favorite things.  We started with two glasses of wine, a nice 2012 James Creek Cabernet and were brought some fresh bread with olive oil and pepper. We started with the Salmon Belly, which was perfectly portioned for a starter and was so fresh! After the shared plate, we moved on to the Ricotta Stuffed Ravioli with Mushroom and a Fall Squash Puree.  This was my favorite dish of the night. Fresh pasta, cooked to perfection, mushrooms with a light cream sauce. It was full decadence. We ended dinner with Coffee and Cider Ribeye with a Celery Root Puree. Cooked Medium it was good, but the Celery Root Puree was a little sweet for my liking and I also wish it as well as the steak was seasoned a little more.  The overall evening was very night and I loved the wine, food and service. I will definitely be back soon since there were definitely some other items on the menu I want to check out.",

Perfect cheese/breading combo and the cheese fondu was gooey and perfect!   For dinner I had the lemon/mussel fettuccini and my boyfriend had the Bolognese. My pasta was out of this world good - the combo of flavors was amazing! We thought the bolognese was just ok - it was lacking some flavor/spice.

We started with a couple of cocktails. I got the blood orange spritz and my husband got something with gin and cucumber that I forget the name of. Both were delicious. The complimentary bread is to die for.   For appetizers we got the Grilled UGF mushrooms and the House-Made Burrata. The mushrooms were just ok, they tasted pretty good, but were nothing fancy for mushrooms. The Burrata was amazing though. It was a great balance of flavors.   For entrees we stuck with pasta since that's what they're known for and got the Bucatini and the Squid Ink Linguine a la Chitarra. We were pretty disappointed by both. The Bucatini was better, but both were incredibly small portion sizes and lacking in flavor.   Our service was good. I really don't think the food is good enough to justify the price here. I wouldn't come back again.",

We made a reservation for 6:15 - side note: we first checked for 6:30, but that was blocked out, so we could either do 6:15 or 7:00. This made me think the place must be fully booked, but at 6:30, we were one of only two groups in there, so don't be scared away if you can't get an official reservation... just walk in.  Our waitress was incredibly nice and fun, and was always around when we needed her, but gave us time when we took a while to check out the menu. We both had two glasses of wine, split the burrata appetizer, got the duck entree (for me) and the hanger steak (for her), and we saved room for dessert - the bread pudding at our waitress's recommendation. The food couldn't have been more on point. My duck (cooked perfectly medium at the chef's recommendation) came with Brussels sprouts (delicious), and my friend's hanger steak came with a cauliflower puree, so there wasn't much food to \"eat,\" but she said it was tasty. All that together plus tip ran us almost $200. Yowza. A little steep but potentially worth it.  Parking is still tricky, and the inside still feels a little cold, but I'm glad I went back for a second look.",

It was a great date night spot and the open kitchen added to the ambience.   I was a little annoyed I couldn't make reservations but we had no problem getting a table on a Wednesday at 9pm- I imagine it's very different during traditional dinner hours.  Our server was wonderfully attentive and knew the menu well. We started with two of the signature cocktails- Barrel Aged Black Manhattan and Kirsch and Clove Old Fashioned, both were delicious!   For dinner we had Squid Ink Linguine a la Chitarra and Bucatini. Both were tasty! The bread that was served was really tasty too! The portions were perfect, I ate so much bread I had pasta take with me.   We were too full for dessert but our server was kind enough to give us one of their oatmeal cookies to-go sense we were celebrating a birthday. It was kind.

    "text": "This could be my favorite new restaurant in Charlotte!!!   We came here Friday night at the recommendation from our friends at Petite Phillipe (shout out to them!). FlourShop is located at the back of Park Road Shopping Center.   When entered, we were immediately greeted by a hostess and found out that, since we didnt have a reservation, the only seating was bar seating. However, the bar is where you want to be! Next time we go, I will actually wait to sit at the bar if needed. The entire kitchen is open and the bar boxes in the kitchen. Basically sitting at the bar is a free show into everything going on. They had an open fire pit with porchetta slowly roasting on it, a guy making pasta right in front of us, and oven where we could see these beautiful octopus cooking. Long story short, if you have a big group, make a reservation. If not, make sure you sit at the bar!  I thought the wine and drink list was pretty extensive and well priced. I had two glasses of wine and my hubby had a mezcal cocktail and a Juicy Jay IPA.   The menu isn't crazy huge and also features a special menu for the day. When you see how many guys are in the kitchen (just a few) and how from scratch everything is, you will understand the menu size. For appetizers, we ordered the meatballs and the fries (yes, my husband and I are 12 year olds at heart and love fries!). The meatballs were so tasty. I believe they were lamb. The sauce wasn't a traditional red but more of a broth based. The fries were so perfectly crisp and the aioli with it was amazing.   For main we split the squid ink pasta (I mean the pasta guy was just making it right in front of me so we has to get it). The portions were big and I am so glad we split. The pasta was delish. The shrimp in it were large. There was also chorizo in it that was so tasty. I found out later that one of the chefs makes the chorizo from scratch. The couple beside us ordered the porchetta, which was the special for the day and slow roasting over the fire, and said it was amazing.   Even at the bar, service was spot on. Considering when we woke up this morning, we talked about how excited we are to go back, this place is a True winner.",
