I will not return to this pizzeria and would not recommend to anyone looking for good pizza.",

Tony's is great!  I am not from NY, so I'm not going to say I know anything about NY pizza, but I really enjoy it.  It's not too greasy compared to others (but still greasy), and I really love it with jalapenos.  However, I love anything with jalapenos, so maybe don't count that.  But the pizza is great!  Thin and gooey crust and HUGE slices.    They don't deliver which can be frustrating, but go for some good pizza instead of those chains next time and check out Tony's!",

The food has remained the same, but the staff has changed a little and this is the reason for the review. I took a friend last week for lunch since we work nearby. After ordering we sat down and the food came shortly afterward.  We were satisfied with everything until some guy comes from the back to wipe off the tables and he looked like the inspiration for the \"pants-on-the ground\" song.  Only this was the \"Italian\" version of pants-on-the-ground.  I was immediately disgusted and I am seriously considering not coming back.",

For the main dish, we ordered a 19 inch pizza with several yummy toppings.  I really loved that the crust was hand made in front of us and it had a nice crunch to it (I hate flimsy pizza!).  My only complaint was that the pizza was just a tad greasy....but I suppose the grease is what gives it some of the yummy flavor.  I also thought the prices were very reasonable....our extra large pizza...two drinks, and two appetizers for 25 bucks.  If you are in the university area, are craving pizza, and are sick of papa johns or dominos, I'd definitely give Tony's a try!",

Yes, it's not just one time but 3 times now the quality on this item is just too bad to eat and had to return it.

The whole point is that this is one of the better pizza's I have had.

Came for lunch and thank goodness my friends ordered for me before I got there because it looks like the service here takes forever. No bueno for the lunch hour rush crowd! I thought the pizza would be super awesome since I got to look at them making the pizza but it turned out to be just average, but then again I'm no pizza connoisseur.  Maybe not an every day eatery for me since it's fairly out of the way but it's not the worst option in the area and prices are fairly decent for the huge portion you get (I had trouble finishing half of my pizza slice).",

The pizza is New York style, so this means that the slices are abnormally large.  Typically, a slice of cheese and slice of pepperoni are enough for my dinner.  Pizza is sold by the slice as well as whole pies.  If I remember correctly, only cheese and pepperoni are available by the slice.  They also have cheese steaks, stromboli, calzones, and other Italian fare.  The location is clean and has a good atmosphere for dining in.  Extra cheese and red pepper is located behind the counter or near the fountain drink station.  The prices are fairly cheap, I don't believe there is anything other than a large pizza that is more than $20 on their menu.  Slices run around 2.50 - 3.25.",

Tony's has some pretty damn good pizza. We usually stay very simple when ordering pizza, and they succeed in doing it well!  One of my favorite things about Tony's is when you order a large (19'') pizza, it barely fits in the box, so I feel like I am getting my moneys worth. Have also had garlic cheese bread which is very good, and they offer pizza slices, which you can't get everywhere.  Crust is nice and crisp most of the time, they don't drown the pie in a ton of sauce. Staff is always very friendly and personable, which is a big bonus, as the majority of people you end up dealing with throughout your day are completely apathetic.

When you walk in it reminds you of an early 90's fast food place but man does the food speak for its self. They sale pizza by the slice all day or you can get a whole pizza made fresh in front of you.   The portion size is beyond copious and there are really good lunch specials.  You can tell that everything is made by hand because every time you order an item its liable to come out looking slightly different than the last. The salads are large and the pizza slice truly has to be folded over in order to eat it! I you get two slices you won't eat for a week.   Some items like the garlic knots are a little inconsistent but, I can easily over look this because the pizza is so good.",

    "text": "Tony's is one of the last things I ate in the University area before moving to WS. Well WS, has a chain too called Mario's that is part of the Tony's family and we found it by accident so I've had the chain recently too! :)  Tony's is pretty good! I have had \"awesome\" pizza and this is pretty darn close to it. The crust is crispy yet limp enough so it doesn't cut the sides of your mouth and the cheese is gooey and the pepperonis have a hint of spicy. The portions are huge and a small pizza can feed AT LEAST 3 hungry people with left overs!!   I think one of the things I like the most is the Chicken Parmesan dinner. It comes with a fantastic salad, bread, chicken parm and spaghetti. It takes forever getting it but it is worth it. My fiance and I always share and it is just enough where we don't take anything home but we are really full because we just stuffed our faces!   However, in the days of extremely fast service, this is definitely not one of those places. If you know what you want and it isn't by the slice...I would CALL AHEAD!! Save yourself a good 15-20 minutes of waiting. Especially since you most likely drove through the heck that is Harris traffic during rush hour to get to the location.  (Dinner time!)  Overall, a good place for food!   Oh and as a special side note, don't forget that some companies and students get a discount on special days! :)",

Fresh ingredients, a chewy, hand tossed crust, and just right pizza sauce. Great stuff!   One negative note. If you are going for slices, Tony's only allows Cheese or Pepperoni on \"slice\" orders. To get it just how you want it, you have to order a whole pie.   Easy parking, open for lunch and dinner.",

I still think Tony's Pizza has the most consistently genuine NY-style pizza in town!  Their ingredients are fresh, hot, and oh! so yummy! Located along the busy streets of Research Park doesn't help matters, however.  Navigating into the area is a bit tricky.  Once you make it, however, you'll be glad you braved the wilderness!   They serve pizza by the slice...and my Quick Tip from the other location stands:  Start with one, and order as you go!  These things are gigantic!  I've decided to start calling them the Pizzilla slices!  Anyway... Noosh!",

Unfortunately, they don't deliver, but the location wasn't too far from our house.   Overall, the pizza was great. In terms of NY style pizza, this is the best we have had so far in Charlotte. The pizza is thin and flavorful, and the crust is chewy and crispy.   The slices are MASSIVE, too. We ordered and XL pizza and it could barely fit in the backseat of our car.   If you are looking for good NY style pizza, I would definitely recommend Tony's.",

Yes, I did go during the lunch rush, but it just seemed like I had to wait forever for two slices of cheese (reheated at that).  The slices are still huge (NY Style) and definitely filling, but something is left to be desired.  Can't really put my finger on it, but it may just have been a \"perfect storm\" that day when I came in.  It is probably because someone else that came in behind me got served before I did - or they stole my order but it does leave a bad taste in  your mouth.  Yes- it is the customer's fault, but I think they should have a better system instead of calling out orders that may or may not have been duplicated by different customers.",

The cheese tastes great and the crust is thin and light.  For me pizza is basically a piece of bread with a bunch of cheese on it, and the cheese is the most important part otherwise you are just eating a big hunk of bread.  This place has the cheese down.  My constructive criticism is that on the pictures of the different pizza sizes, from a personal all the way up to a 24\" pizza, they show them covered in pepperoni without any bald spots of cheese, but the actual pizza has about 1/2 the pepperoni you see in those pictures.  My pizza partner doesn't like pepperoni so she was happy about the lack of it, but I am the pepperoni craving partner and I wasn't happy that they depict a much more densely covered pizza than what you end up getting.  I would like them to update and change the picture or put as much pepperoni as pictured on the actual pie.",

I recommend calling ahead for pickup and arriving 5 mins early. The staff is great and the service is on par.   You can't go wrong with the pizza but the garlic knots and wings are also items I order frequently. As much as I love their pizza, I personally don't think it makes for good leftovers. Typically, reheating their pizza makes it taste off. Not sure what it is but usually, my family loves leftover pizza but Tony's is really only good when it is fresh. I  I've ordered a variety of items and have never had a bad experience. Definitely give any of the pasta dishes a try if you're feeling like some comfort food. Everything is always fresh and made to order. I love that you can see the staff preparing your food. If you are planning on eating in, just know that it can get a little warm and stuffy during summer because it's an open kitchen and the pizza oven is huge.",

It's reminiscent of when I'm doing my usual walk through NYC and I stop in a 99 cent pizza store for a slice and a soda.   The slices are huge and the ratio makes sense. The crust is crispy. The only thing they could improve is the salt. The slices are a bit salty. Could be the sauce.   I do really like the garlic, cheese bread. I like the gooey cheese on some toasted, crispy, buttery garlic bread.  Way better than what you get at like Papa Johns, dominos, etc. and it's only $5. Chea!  My dude says the lasagna is good. May have to try that one day.",

The garlic and olive oil base was a perfect balance and not too overwhelming on the toppings.  The crust was a bit chewy for me, something I've noticed with many pizza places around here, but I'm starting to think that's how New York style does it.  The garlic bread was delicious and had enough cheese for any cheese lover.  The sauce that came with the bread was also good, although I don't think I would enjoy it on a pizza so I'm happy I got a white pizza.",

Always consistent and when I phone it in if they say it'll be ready in 20 minutes you can count on it.  Besides getting a 'The Worx' pizza today I also tried their Italian sub sandwich served \"Tony's way\". Man that was a tasty sandwich! Can't wait to try something different again!",

Menu is, of course, more varied, but it contains the things you would want and hope for from a place like this.  Worth the visit if you're a transplant for sure.",

Pepperoni is a little greasier than I prefer but overall a pretty good slice.  Friendly staff. One of my favorites in Charlotte.",
