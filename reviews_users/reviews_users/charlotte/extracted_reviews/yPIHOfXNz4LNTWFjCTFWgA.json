    "text": "This place is a great find and departure from the norm. It's a nice little establishment located fairly close to home. The food is always great and the prices are fair. The folks there are great people as well. What I also love is they have different flavored fries.   My only qualm is since I'm from the Midwest, our gyros back home are packed with so much meat that the pita has zero chance of touching the other side when being rolled up (you literally need and get a fork), so out here I'm getting about 1/3 of the meat at the same price. But if you're from here you'd never realize what you're missing out on.   One tip is to not get the fries to go unless they're dry. We got the lemon topping and it was soggy at home :(.  Overall, no question, put this place on your list.",

Large menu of authentic Greek food, priced very reasonably and all made, as the name says, FRESH and delicious!  Gonna be a regular! Liquor license applied for, so beer soon available I assume. #Winning",

It didn't take me long to understand the reason for the immediate love that folks were showing - it's because of the great people, the FANTASTIC quality and the unique and interesting menu that you will find at Greco's.   I've since met owner Nick and his enthusiasm and desire to please his customers is so rare in this area and in these times. He and his family truly work hard to earn the business. I've eaten here at least a dozen times since they opened and the quality has been exceptional every time.   The shrimp skewer platter is awesome and I could eat a gyro every day for the next month. Nick grills the meat to order every time so it's always fresh and hot. The salads are also very crisp and fresh.   I plan on working my way through the whole menu and I look forward to visiting Greco's regularly.   It is so great to have Greco's in Fort Mill and  I recommend them highly.",

I've had Falafel all over the world and this somehow surpassed all of them.

I got the traditional gyro and the Mrs. got the Greek salad with chicken. The meats were well seasoned, the tzatziki was home made and tasted great! Their stuffed grape leaves and hummus were really good, too. Thrilled to have another great restaurant to add to our Saturday night options! You can probably tell from the other reviewers pictures that it's more of a \"counter service\" place. Inside is nice, no frills. A little small. It's in a strip mall. Has outside seating. I decided not to take off any stars for the layout. It's not their fault. Food is great, that's all that matters!",

We have been going to the one in Blakeney for years.   I stopped in this new location and the owner Nick was working the register. They definitely changed the decor from the previous incarnations and it no longer feels like a Donato's, which was the original business that occupied this space. It's quick serve casual but they have a lot of options including vegetarian, salads, gyros and more. Nick was working the register and despite the place being busy, the staff was handling it. I ordered two mezze platters to go. They include a little bit of everything. The food was really good. The only negative is that I ordered the large piece of kefte (kind of like a Mediterranean meatloaf) but I received the half portion. It wasn't a huge deal because it was still good and the platters have a good amount of food anyway.  It is nice to finally have some decent Greek food in Fort Mill/Tega Cay. It's even better that it is cheap, fast and good.",

The food is fresh, great tasting, generous serving sizes and there's quite a variety available + cold beverages, including beer.

Ordered Chicken Gyro, Grilled Chicken Kebobs and the devilishly deliciously looking Baklava that was just then refilled on the front counter.  Got our number card, found a table around the corner and the wait starts.  Either our food was late or we were so hungry even minutes felt like hours, lol.  Well, the restaurant was crowded so can't complain on the way, but we were hungry too. My chicken gyro was delicious, just awesome, enjoyed every bite of it.  The tzatziki sauce was just delicious and fresh, chicken was perfectly cooked and spices was just on point. Grilled chicken kebobs was only OK, not great.  Agreed its kebobs, its usually dry but ours was dry and a little hard as well.  The rice that was chosen as a side was very bland no spices or herbs which would enhance rice's flavor.  For 11 bucks we were expecting a better tasting chicken kebobs. Finale - Baklava. That's it.  Everything was forgiven. That was one big, flaky, nutty, warm, sweetttttttt, super delicious baklava we ever had. LOVED IT.",

The chicken platter is sliced dry chicken - I'm hoping the kebab is better.   The rice pilaf lacks the saffron or normal Greek seasoning.  The hummus is good but could use more tahini - also slightly dry and lacking good flavor.   I'd come again but I hope the other offerings improve my impression of the place - otherwise convenient Greek food is its best angle.  Jasmine and Mad Greek on South Blvd and Zeoutoni in Ballentyne all offer far superior Greek food.",

I returned last week for a lamb special platter which included, 5-6 small strips of lamb (gyro), a side Greek salad, rice pilaf and warm pita bread. For a price tag of almost $12 I do not feel the portions are substantial for dinner, although the food is quite tasty and authentic. I will probably return as it is in my neighborhood but when I'm looking for a more hearty meal, I may drive a little further out for a similar cuisine.",

I was surprised how juicy and flavorful their gyro was--not dry at all. The same can be said about their chicken and salmon. I honestly think their shrimp is much better than some seafood restaurants. I've gone to many places where the shrimp was over cooked and rubbery, but that is not the case here. Their portion sizes are pretty big, and their small fries can feed 2-3 people. Come hungry or you'll be leaving with leftovers.   Not to mention, their staff is friendlu and really helpful if you don't know what to get. John suggested for me to try several new dishes and I was happy with what I got!",

The lady working behind the counter came over and chatted with us for a bit. She was so sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. The owners weren't there because they are in Greece.

Then tried to down vote my review of the restaurant.  To clarify from Trey's attack. I am not the father and I was not in the family that was accosted in front of us. I was with the group of gentleman in line behind them.  It  is positively deplorable for any business to behave in this manner.  In response to the owner:  The Greek Grill - SC that is not the way things happened. This is merely spin control for the horrible behavior of your son. Your son was rude and accosted the family before the child stepped into the aide counter area NOT BEHIND THE COUNTER. YOUR SON LECTURED AN ENTIRE FAMILY IN FRONT OF MY PARTNER AND FRIENDS AS WELL AS OTHER PATRONS.   As you continue with the lies and propaganda. Trey may not work for you as you say, either that or he does not exist and it was your son or somebody else messaging me directly because there were no male patrons aside from my group and the family that was attacked by your son. Justifying your sons atrocious behavior is not an apology. Further more I don't deserve the apology. The special needs girl in the parking lot crying because they had to leave does.",

Their hand-cut fries are perfection and FYI they're big enough to share.   Thanks Nick! We'll be back!   \"Panama\"",

My wife enjoyed her  Falafel that was prepared in a lettuce wrap. Her fries were also very good . We will come back to try other menu items for sure",

Tonight we came in and the owner was at the only register talking to a couple for over 5 minutes about Greece, where to visit, his house on the Southern Island and he just got back a week ago. My family walked out. Not sure if the family behind me stayed or left as they were frustrated as well. Employees behind the counter could tell we were getting pissed.   Week prior the place was full and young kid running the show was all over the place apologizing for the wait. This week it's was dead and owner takes up peoples time and becomes a tour guide. Not going back.",

Love their traditional Greek gyros and Greek salads with lamb added.  Great flavor and spice.  The only con....are the fries.  I said it in my original review, they are just okay - they are good fries, but okay in the fact of the seasoned fries, if you told me they were seasoned with cumin/garlic, lemon, etc. I would never know.  Just bland seasoning.  Still look forward to going back whenever we are in the mood for some great Greek food.",

Everything is fresh and homemade. They brought the food promptly and checked on us often. We got several homemade desserts to go and they were all amazing and the portion size was generous.

The lamb platter looked more like a platter of fries with a side of meat soaked in grease. When I picked the meat up with a fork, I would have to wait for the grease to stop dripping before I could eat it. As for the portion, 4 tiny pieces of meat (pic included). Lastly, the fries were substantially undercooked. I was excited to try a new Greek place and decided on The Greek Grill based on the reviews, but I wish we had gone somewhere else. Maybe dining-in receives better attention to portion and quality than to go orders. 1 star for not having to wait for the order upon arrival.",

They're quick, and efficient, and the food is not sloppy. Prices are reasonable. I tried the falafel there today and Good Gosh it was to die for. Try the lemon zest hummus, and the lemon oregano fries are amazing. YUM!!!! You cant beat the prices for fresh quick REAL Greek food. The manager Nick came up to check on us, he is a very humble guy. Glad to see a great business being successful. Cant wait to go back.",

He described the two hummus flavors in detail to help me decide.  I had the vegetarian gyro and I was so excited to see the option for a whole wheat pita!!  my friend had the chicken gyro and She even had chicken leftover after the gyro was gone so they definitely don't skimp.  So delicious.  Will be back often. :)",

I'm Lebanese and from New Jersey it will be a Year that I'm living here and to have a Greek place right down the street from where I live is a bonus it was my first time there and it won't be the last! They have a decent menu and was so excited to try the hummus which I got a small garlic hummus as a starter and it came with delicious pita bread which was warm and soft just perfect, the hummus was so good next time I go I'm ordering a large one  then for lunch I got the traditional Gyro and words can't describe the party that was going on in my mouth it was so good the spices on the meat was so flavorful the tzatziki sauce was perfect I love extra so next time I'll have them out more on it! I'm a sucker for baklava so you know I had to try it and I so wasn't disappointed it was one of the best I've had in very long time. The owner's of the place couldn't have been any nicer they even took time and sat down with me and my friends who have been there before and it turns out the places they owned in NJ I've been too before such a small world! I'm so glad they came to Fort Mill they definitely have me sold!!",
