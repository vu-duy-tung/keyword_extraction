    "text": "At $6.99 /lunch or $9.99/dinner this buffet cant be beat. Ichiban is more than \"the typical\" Chinese buffet as it offers sushi and a made to order hibachi station. Dare i say it....but the sushi is better than the buffet at RuSans. Also, I was much more impressed with my visit here here than at the $10.00+ more per person trip to Tin Tin. Ichiban is what it is with decent Americanized-Chinese food and other typical American fare one would expect to see on a buffet of this sort. Think beef-broccoli, sesame chicken, pepper steak, eggrolls, stuffed mushrooms, chicken nuggets, fried shrimp etc. There should be something for everyone. The food itself is pretty good considering the price. Sure some items, like the desserts are a bit lacking, but lets be honest here... how many buffets really excel in the dessert area?  Keep in mind that visiting for lunch or an early dinner is probably the best time to go. Once i went close to closing time and there were not as many choices remaining. Which i personally can totally understand as it impacts waste and food costs. Overall, for decent food, huge selection, nice staff and great price i say Ichiban is a worth a shot.",

I tried a little bit of their sushi California rolls which was edible but not overly satisfying. I was reluctant to try any of the sushi that had fish in it because you know, it's a buffet and who knows. Then I did the hibachi grill which was okay, probably the healthiest thing in the place since I loaded my dish up with fresh veggies to be sauteed on the grill. The price was only $6.99 for lunch. So I guess it is A-ok in a pinch.",

There are no signs identifying the kinds of sushi (i.e. California, Philadelphia, etc.); nor are there any signs noting possible allergen cross-contamination.  The only signage indicated which sushi had raw fish and even so, it was poorly placed and not easy to tell which contain raw fish if you don't know your sushi.  I also fail to understand the attraction of using shredded crab that's had some unknown mystery sauce mixed into it; to me, that just ruins the flavor of the crab, which is why I get sushi with crab.  The hibachi grill also has no labels identifying products; I selected what appeared to be filleted boneless chicken, but was actually some kind of fish.  The food was cooked well but the fish ruined the taste of what I had expected to be a chicken and steak combination plate.  The buffet was appealing visually, but many of the foods either had no taste or were overseasoned.  My son's macaroni and cheese contained so much seasoning that I couldn't even eat it, and I like spicy foods.  The fruit on the dessert bar was either unripe or overripe; nothing we chose was palatable.  The mango was mushy and had an \"off\" taste to it.  The bananas in strawberry sauce were ripe, but the sauce itself was tasteless.  The cookies were not fresh in the least.  All in all, we left behind more food than we consumed.  We won't be back any time soon.",

    "text": "OMG what a surprise.  So, a few years ago this location was a prime buffet so it will let you know that I do not get over to this side of the interstate often, especially when I realized that this was now Ichiban's Buffet Restaurant (has been for more than two years).  At first, the signage and outside appearance kept me questioning my ability to want to eat here, so I looked to my fellow Yelper's for recent reviews, and this helped ease my fear of the unknown. It was a solid 4 Stars.  When I saw a few blue collar workers coming out of the restaurant, I knew I was in for a treat, and for just $6.99 for a lunch buffet, I was ready to take an adventure.  It was very clean on the inside, and I was very surprised by the sheer number of buffet tables which were completely full with fresh food.  The food ranged from sushi, pork, lasagna, salmon, to chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken and more chicken. I felt I was in a Forest Gump movie with every known possible variety of chicken, and yes, they even offered shrimp, stuffed shrimp, peeled shrimp, firecracker shrimp, grilled shrimp, garlic shrimp.....I think you get the point.  So, I don't have much time for lunch, but between the fast service, the number of tables and the fresh food, I will definitely make an effort to enjoy this buffet more often for lunch.  They do offer take out .....you pay by the pound.  I have added a picture for your enjoyment.",

Let's start with the sushi. Now, my family is in the sushi business so I know my sushi. Whoever said that Ichiban's sushi is fresh and the best in the area obviously never had decent quality sushi. I can't even say it was decent here...it was probably the worst sushi I've ever had. The sushi rice was hard. The fish was fishy...not the least bit fresh at all.   The hot items were so bland that salt couldn't even make it edible. The general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, fried chicken, broccoli stir fry, green beans....my God! How do you mess this up? Everything was flavorless...either overcooked, too chewy, too dry, or ridiculously bland. Just horrible.  Now onto desserts..how coyld they mess this up right? I mean, after all, they didn't make it. But boy was I wrong. Only Ichiban could manage to screw up dessert. The cakes were so dry that I had to spit it out...couldn't make myself swallow it. Everything this restaurant serves is inedible.   With this being Charlotte, I guess you can't really expect much. There are much better restaurants in the area so I highly advise you to keep on driving. Ichiban was made to disappoint.",

There isn't anything remotely Japanese about this restaurant besides the substandard sushi choices.  I've been to Japanese buffet restaurants with the similar mix of Japanese/Chinese food and believe me, there are good ones out there! But not this one... I came here with my family waiting for our flight out of Charlotte and I more or less enjoyed the Yuengling more than anything here.  The majority of my time here I was having a hard time discerning what I would be choosing to consume during my time here... I more or less felt more sorry for me 4 year old brother who didn't have a choice really in what he was being fed here; poor guy.  If you could care less, fancy yourself in some low-quality buffet, this is the place for you.  I personally would choose Golden Corral instead of this place any day.",

He ended up overcooking it so much that the veggies I chose were all mush and ultimately inedible.   The buffet is mediocre as well and not as many choices as other places I've been to for a cheaper price. Service was okay. Won't be going back.",

There are numerous hot buffet bars with dozens of entrees, appetizets, soups, desserts to choose from.  Unfortunatley, this is a prime example of how quality suffers when a place specializes in churning out volumes of dishes (a lot of which were barely warm, I might add.)

We did a google search on our phone and found this place since we were staying near the airport. ****WARNING***** THIS PLACE DOESN\"T PROVIDE A/C even if it is 100 degree outside.  First of all, the exterior appearance is not appealing at all. It looks old, outdated, crumbling, and parking lot was just dirty and trashy. But because sometime you can't judge a book from the outside of its cover. We decided to give them a try. When we looked at the food selection and the price. We thought that it wasn't too bad and sat down. Now comes the bad part. Today was 98 degrees outside with a feel like 105 degree. NO A/C. It was hot, humid, and muggy. I couldn't even eat my food without swallowing my own sweat. The seat we were seated was torn and duct taped. . The walls were busted, dirty, and some of the wallpaper were peeling. The ceiling had yellow stain, and the ceiling fans were dirty. The bathroom was like a murder scene when I tried to wash my hand before heading to the buffet. DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY and DISGUSTING! Now when you think of it, think of how it is in the kitchen. The food were very salty which was meant for you to down on your drink to fill you up instead of being full on the food. Food was just too salty, so I didn't even finish my first plate. Because of no A/C and it felt like a oven in that place. We left after 5 minute not even trying to explore the hibachi or sushi selection they had.  Will I return? A big fat NO! Do I recommend. NO!",

I am going to report this to the health department PLEASE LOOK AT THE VIDEO . The pee in the toilets looked like they had been there for hours ! The general manger said he doesn't care, that he doesn't have a set schedule to keep the restroom clean , and that its okay for customers to go in there make a mess and then fix there on food !

When I confronted the lady at the register about the situation she turned extremely red and couldn't even explain to me why she did that. My appetite was gone after feeling very uncomfortable so I just decided to leave.

I have to say , she was truly surprised that I refused to pay for it. She called over another lady that I couldn't understand and I explained again. She, was not at all surprised.

I've eaten sushi at dozens of other restaurants, but Ichiban is by far my favorite, and I go there at least a few times every month.  They have honestly NEVER served me a bad piece of fish, and they aren't heavy on sauce like a lot of other Americanized sushi restaurants.  The first roll I ever purchased, the Ichiban Roll (a small version of the Rainbow Roll) is my favorite to this day.  While I agree with some other reviewers that the non-sushi offerings are not great, those are simply not the reason to come to Ichiban -- just like you shouldn't go to an American seafood restaurant and expect them to have a good hamburger.  That being said, the hibachi scallops are good, the pho is excellent, and the homemade strawberry cake with kiwi (made by the owner's wife) is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  It puts Dewey's next door to shame, and reminds me that Vietnam (the homeland of the owner) was once a french colony.  Great food, great staff (they keep the same servers year after year), and a friendly owner.  I can safely say that Ichiban is one of my favorite restaurants in Winston-Salem.",

    "text": "Not horrible, not great. There were decent things on the tables and some things were just too gross to eat.  I went here because I was stuck on a long layover and needed to crash at the hotel next door. Without a car, this was the only decent place I could get to .  I tried the fish and the salad bar..I then tried the sauteed fish - it was very tasty - although not particularly fresh. I would go here again if I was in the same boat - desperate with no where else to go.",

    "text": "Holy God this place sucks. It is the worst Chinese buffet I've ever had in my life. I read the negative reviews and thought there's no way that this place could be as bad as they said it was. But it is.  From the poor service to the fried chicken that tasted like fish. It was horrible. Have no idea how this place stays in business. It must all come from people staying at the motels that have never been there before and don't believe the Yelp reviews like me.  There is an older review from a lady that says she wishes that she had went to the Waffle House across the street I wish I had as well. It was so bad in the middle of dinner my stomach started turning. I left the restaurant certain that I would get diarrhea during the night. Thank goodness I didn't.",

    "text": "Given the number of critical reviews, I was very unsure what I was getting into when we decided to give the Ichiban Buffet a try.  Well, either we really lucked out on a Sunday evening or they have improved their act in the past several months.  It was a perfectly satisfactory dining experience.  As noted by others, this is NOT fine dining.  It is an Asian buffet.  But the selection was large, the food was reasonably fresh, and we got good attention from our server, who frequently refilled my ice tea.  The sushi selection was a bit limited, but it was fresh.  The offering for the hibachi grill were also fresh and the fry chef knew his business.  There was a wide range of fresh, fried and baked offerings for the buffet, including shrimp and frogs legs!  It would not be mistaken for 'health food', but it is definitely value for your money.",

    "text": "I was really craving Chinese buffet and found this place on Yelp. Reviews looked okay...walked in and the place is pretty dinky. The seats were worn out and it just felt dirty. There was plenty of seating which was nice. All the food was just so...Blech. The chicken dishes were too starchy and the sauce tasted weird. Even the fried rice was overly greasy. The clams were chewy and the sushi looked gray. To be honest nothing was good although the hot and sour soup was decent. Prices were cheap - about $12 per person - but I'd rather pay a few more bucks and get a better buffet.",
