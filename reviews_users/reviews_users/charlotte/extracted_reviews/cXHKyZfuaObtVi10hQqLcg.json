(substitution cost $2.99) and Harvest Kale Salad as my side ($5.99). After tax, my lunch cost me $17.66 and I didn't even get a drink! This place is outrageously expensive!

However, I do have two complaints that really bugged me both times.  1) It is so loud in there.  There are a million hard surfaces and nothing to absorb the sound.  I had a hard time hearing my lunchmate talk.  This could be easily solved with some design choices that soften the clatter.  2) I wonder if their hoods are sufficient.  Both times, my suit smelled like good after I left which made me feel like the exhaust is inadequate.  Not the biggest problem in the world except almost everyone eating there is in work clothes and would prefer not to dry clean because they are there.  The good is so good, I will overlook my complaints but would be so happy if those changes got made.",

The order included : 2 strawberry banana smoothies, roasted butternut salad with chicken, 2 zucchini spaghetti and eggplant meatballs, one Caesar salad without the chicken, Spivey avocado and lime with quinoa and chicken, spiced pumpkin smoothie and southwest salad. Everything was devoured! It was fresh and made on time- which I appreciated not having to wait. It was annoying with all the construction downtown - and no parking -to pick up so many \"to-go orders\" . I defied the law and just parked our front anyway... I will say I think the serving size is a bit small for the price. If you don't get certain ingredients like black beans or chicken added, I would say you're definitely not getting your money's worth AT ALL. Luckily I beat the lunch rush hour  so the lines weren't out the door. The place is trendy and cute like a farm to table feel. Staff was busy so didn't interact much- to rate their customer service. This is definitely a place I would try once on my own but order for company lunch especially if your staff eats healthy. Everyone absolutely loved their shakes including me. I do wish they labeled the salad dressings flavor- it's hard to determine who gets what salad dressing when there's for different salads and 4 different dressings. This is a solid 3.9 in my opinion.",

It was in huge chunks and the dressing was just globbed in one corner of it. I will say the drink was amazing. For $16 they can serve a larger turkey burger, prep the salad better and have fresh bread.",

We ordered as we were walking there from the Duke Energy Center, and it was ready about 5 minutes after we arrived.  I got the Harvest Kale Salad ($8.49) with a bottle of water ($1.99). I should've just stuck with the water from their drink fountain, but I got a little confused with the app. Also, all their drinks seemed to be Maine Root, so no sodas here. The salad was bigger than I'd planned on, and I ate the whole thing. Nom nom nom. I love healthy food, but I'm still amazed at how tasty it was AND only 309 calories according to their website.  Although it was busy, there seemed to be enough seating - some individual tables and some community with a few tables outside. The price seemed normal enough for me for lunch, and I was glad to have somewhere a little healthier to try.",

I ordered the zucchini noodles with eggplant meatballs.  It was served in a paper bowl.  I could have eaten the paper bowl and been unable to taste the difference between the food and the paper.  Not much flavor, and the flavor that there was was simply not good.  They need to revamp their red sauce.  It sucks.    Twenty minutes after eating this way overpriced and sub-par lunch, I was firing kale out of my ass at warp speed.  Dear God!!! I nearly achieved lift off!  After 6, yes SIX, trips to the kamode, I finally ran out of anal ammo.  I may have to work this weekend given how much time I spent on the shitter during business hours yesterday.    I guess the upshot is that if you are trying to lose weight, this is the place to go.  Definitely a net loss of calories as the food ran through me in 20 minutes, and then continual muscles spasms and anal eruptions definitely resulted in net caloric burn.  I'd rather get on the treadmill for caloric burn. Speaking of burn, my brown eye is rubbed raw from yesterday's B.Good adventure.  I am not enjoying that.  Not at all.",

    "text": "More like B Okay.  I was excited to try B Good because to my knowledge, it's the only place in Uptown where you can order a burger with a gluten free bun. My interests may be niche, but nonetheless I was looking forward to giving this place a shot.  My first impression was that this place hasn't been finished yet. The restaurant is cavernous and stark with high ceilings and no sound absorption. It's deafening during the lunch rush but I'd imagine it's nearly as loud even when they're slow.   The layout is awkward. You place your order to the left, but there's hardly any room to queue up. This leaves patrons looking at one another in confusion, asking \"is this the line? Are you in line?\" The waiting area is in the center of the counter and it seems to be where everyone ordering to-go awkwardly gathers.   I went for lunch with a coworker and ordered first. I got the Cousin Oliver burger. When the woman behind the counter asked what cheese I'd like, I assumed that meant I had options included. Not so; when I got my receipt I saw I'd been charged $1.25 to add cheddar. Brutal.   After ordering to dine in, you're handed a buzzer and left to your own devices. We grabbed a table in the back and waited for our buzzers to light up. The plush chairs along the windows look comfy, but they're far too low for the tables and you'll feel like a child. If you're dining in, you'll have to leave your seat to go up and claim your meal. I'd imagine this is a real pain if you're lunching alone; abandon your table and you may return with nowhere to sit. I guess the cheese upcharges don't pay for a food runner.  My burger looked beautiful when I picked it up. You'll have to go to the right of the counter to get ketchup and mustard -- no other sauces or condiments seem to be available. As such, my burger felt very dry as I ate it.   The fries, by the way, don't seem to be worth the additional cost of including a side. Mine were pale and limp, without adequate seasoning (and only ketchup to dip 'em in, as noted above).   All told, a cheeseburger and fries set me back $14. I'd happily shell out this much for a great, flavorful burger, but that's not what I received. I wish I could offset this with high marks for service, but there really isn't any service, other than borderline predatory upcharging at the register.  Maybe it's my mistake for ordering a burger at a healthy lunch spot. I'm not against giving B Good another try with another dish, but I'm not in a rush to return.",

I love that most of the food is locally sourced (look at me, doing my part to support local agriculture!)  Its also pretty darn tasty! For a long time I would only get the spicy avocado bowl because it was so freaking good, but this week I have ventured out and tried the zucchini spaghetti with eggplant 'meatless' balls....and they knocked my socks off....SO GOOD!  I did something a little outrageous to this veg friendly dish and added BACON!  Yup i did it and it was soooooo tasty!  But bacon makes most things that much better right... Even so, the dish stood pretty well on its own. The avocado toast is pretty good too. I love that B.Good has a fountain of all natural sodas, that my kids love.   If you are looking for a healthy fast food option this is definitely the way to go.   Next i think I will try the smoothies because they look pretty tasty too, with a variety of blends.  Great addition to my dine out roster!",

Now, let's move on to the food: Whole wheat bun - dry Egg - dry Turkey burger - dry Avocado - bitter Sharp cheddar - NOT SHARP! Bacon - dry to the point where it was hard to bite - cooked the goodness right out of it :-(  Also, the soda fountain had some issue where the diet soda was not carbonated enough. The raspberry seltzer is also awful. I've let them know about the soda fountain, and that's usually a temporary issue anyway.  This place had three stars as of my review. I am sorry to say this was a harsh lesson in what happens when you dip below 3.5 star places and try to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt. There are plenty of places within a couple of blocks that have 4+ stars and offer similar fare. I would suggest you try there first as I know I won't be trying this place again (which is a shame because I'm only a block away).",

Nothing on my veggie burger was seasoned. It was extremely bland  and unappealing.   Price: I paid $14 + for a veggie burger, side and drink -_-    Pros:   Customer service: I ended up requesting a new corn on the cob after  I saw that I received the smallest corn that they had on the grill. It was extremely small to the point that It shouldn't have been sold at its normal price of almost $5. The employees settled this issue quickly and even offered that I keep both cobs (I declined ).   Grilled corn: Though my original corn was tiny , it was replaced with an average sized piece that was pretty good. The jalapeno/ cilantro ranch was delish! It probably would be a great compliment to the bland burger that I got.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, the burgers are good, I like the natural ingredients concept, it's really close to where I work. I just need the staff to do the bare minimum and do things like take my order without making me feel like I'm inconveniencing them. The first time I went in, the service was lackluster but not terrible. The 2nd time, I stood at the counter for what felt like a very long time while I watched 2 staff members put slaw in cups and other prep work stuff. There was nobody in the restaurant- even though it was 5ish on a workday. Eventually I was at least acknowledged and was told they'd be with me \"in just a minute\". I continued to stand there for an awkwardly long time and decided to walk out- hangry and frustrated. I decided to give the ONE more chance and went in a couple of days ago after work. Again, I stood at the counter awkwardly. I asked someone in the back if I was in the right place to order and he said someone would be right with me. The server strolled to the counter and appeared to be unhappy. I wanted to ask her if I was inconveniencing her in some way, but continued my order. I couldn't understand her as she mumbled- i obviously annoyed her and it was really uncomfortable!!  I just wanted my burger and to get out of there quickly. I don't know what's going on- maybe I'm going in at the wrong time?  But why be open if it's not a good time. I get it, I used to work in the food service industry and it can be tough! All I ask is you make an effort to make me feel valued as a customer. I don't feel welcome at this location and don't plan to go back. Burgers are great but I'll find another place that appreciates my business.",

I have tried the Spicy Avocado and Lime bowl with chicken and it's decent but the kale is SO dry. The Zucchini Noodles and Eggplant Meatballs are pretty good, but I think if you order to go they need to plate the items separately because my zoodles were very soggy. I have also tried the other kale based salads and the kale was very dry in each. I do like their turkey burgers and you can order with a lettuce wrap instead of the bun. Also, bravo to the fact that their ketchup is Sir Kensington's!  Customer service here has never stood out to me and they get very behind during the lunch hour. I think for the price you can definitely find better options Uptown.",

Once you figure out that the menu lacks things like pancakes or whoppers, you really have a good variety of tasty meals to select from.  I had the power grain with grilled chicken added.  You also had the choice of adding quinoa or something called 7 grain.  I tasted each and preferred the 7 grain as it justed tasted better with the barley wheat pieces and it was a warm item, very tasty.  My friend had a salad with large fresh chunks of avocado that looked delish.  Overall the food was excellent (5/5).  It's a simple counter order and they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. Simple and efficient (5/5).  Give it a whirl,  you'll enjoy it!!",

Today for example, my friend and i didn't get our order in for a good minute with no other customers in the restaurant. Then when we did get service the woman seemed so irritated with us, so we ordered, paid, tipped and waited and left as soon as we got our bag. We arrived home to find half our order missing, although we paid for all of it, and the restaurant not picking up after 20 minutes of calling. Safe to say we will not be returning",

Went here on a Wednesday around 6pm and the place wasn't busy at all. 2 other people inside with food already, so many open tables.   Placing order was easy, no wait in line. We ordered one power burger wheat bun, side of \"real fries\", one kids chocolate milkshake. *TIP* if you download their app you can get a free side.    I liked that they have fancy lemonades and getting free side. Our wait time was ridiculous, it took so long for our small order. When they finally called our name, they told us our fries weren't ready yet but they didn't want us to wait since our burger was ready. We ate burger and almost whole shake before the fries came.   The appearance of the burger looked bomb! The bun and all the toppings were delicious, the taste of the burger itself - I wasn't impressed. The \"real fries\" which are their plain fries, were also pretty good! The chocolate shake was yummy! So overall just the wait & taste of their burger was disappointing considering price. I realize they are \"root\" based. Meaning they use fresh ingredients, locally from NC & SC which I love, so I kinda get the price. But the taste and wait, along with price explains my rating. I def still might give this place a second chance and hope they are better next time!   Good vibes from within. Workers were so so, not take friendly. They do have a healthy kids menu! $5.99. Kids shakes or \"kale crush\" smoothie both $2.99.",

    "text": "As mentioned by several other reviewers, my B Good experience was just 'B Okay'.   As a first-timer, I decided to go for their seasonal summer burger. It had a roasted corn salsa, bacon, & avocado on it. The flavor or of the burger was great, but the burger itself was small (i.e. a lot of extra bun around the edges) and overcooked. Had this been a nice juicy burger, this would have definitely warranted a 4-star review. I also think $8 for a burger only (had to pay $1.25 on top of that to add cheese) is steel for a fast casual place. That is honestly sit down price for me, so I'd be hesistant to come back based on that alone. After adding on $3.xx for some sweet potato fries, my meal came to about $14. Again, that's sit-down restaurant pricing.   My wife had gotten one of the quinoa salad/bowl meals, and hers was great. I would steer that route if you're keen on eating here. Sandwiches are definitely not work the hype or expense.   Side note: WHO DOESN'T CARRY RANCH DRESSING?! They had a jalapeno ranch ... can't you just leave the jalapeno out of some of the batch and carry both regular + jalapeno? What kind of savages run this place????",

I do not doubt they use quality ingredients, but I wasn't blown away by the taste. I appreciate the time it took them to hand prepare my meal from scratch, the kitchen is open so you can witness them doing this. The restaurant itself is spacious, plainly decorated. I did enjoy the fresh juices/lemonades with herbal infusions. I'm sure there are greater things on the menu that I just need to go back a try.",

Please do better. I couldn't  even go back to remedy this because the restaurant was already closed.

It tasted lovely & lively - the lime really made the dish tasty. The chipotle  puree and the red pepper vinaigrette gave it the spicy zing! I would've enjoyed it more if they had added more avocado since there were only a few slices in proportion to the other ingredients. It was as fresh as they claimed it would be so I was satisfied. I also ordered the sweet potato fries on the side and unfortunately, it was soggy and way too salty for my buds. Their fresh juices, flavored lemonades and teas were delicious! I would've given them a 3.5 stars if only those sweet potato fries came out crispy and less salty. I'll try their other bowls next time I'm back in Charlotte.",

They give you so little for a smoothie but then again it's not that bad.  However the turkey burger was extremely dry, like no juiciness at all. My daughter didn't eat it. I ate it because I was mad hungry. The fries were good and she didn't touch the broccoli but hey she already got kale and spinach from her smoothie so mission accomplished.  I may come back to see what's up with their other dishes... for adults.",

The atmosphere is pretty chill and reminds you of like a Five Guys, Fuel Pizza or other similar style restaurants. I work a few blocks away and have been meaning to try them out.  The menu was really straightforward and all of the options looked really good. I decided to go with the El Guapo burger. It came with crispy bacon, jalapeno slaw, and jalapeno ranch. It was very tasty and had a nice kick to it. Not too spicy, but enough to feel the heat some. For anyone wanting some more punch, they have several hot sauces to spice it to your level.  I wanted to get a shake to go with the burger, but I wasn't really feeling the price. A burger and a shake would have been over $13, not including any sides. The burger had flavor but lacked some size to it. For the price paid I would liked to have seen something a little bigger.   Overall, I had a good experience there, but I'm not sure I'd spend this kind of money again. The ingredients are fresh and are all sourced from farmers, but I'm always looking for the best bang for the buck and I don't feel as if that happened here.",

I went to B Good a good handful of times this past summer because my office was given 50% off coupons.  I tried a variety of different options, but my favorite hands down was the spicy avocado lime bowl with chicken added (kale, sauteed veggies, avocado, black bean & corn salsa, tomato, queso fresco, lime, cilantro, chipotle puree, red pepper vinaigrette + chicken). It had great flavor and was very filling. I also noticed you usually got more in your bowl when you got take out vs eating at B Good. The other menu item that was delicious was the Roasted root & mushroom bowl - and of course add protein. I did learn the sweet potato fries were always hit or miss- some times they were cooked perfectly, and others they were super crispy and slightly overcooked.  However, even with the 50% off coupon, my meals were still $7-$8 for one person (no drink included) - so you're looking at $14-$16 PER PERSON for a fast casual take out place. To me, I don't think it's worth it to pay full price here. If I get another coupon, I will return, but there are so many other healthy options in Uptown you can get for a better price.",
