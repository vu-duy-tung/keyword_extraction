No one else in the group had ever experienced Ethiopian food, so this was my pick! The food was amazing: a few people were even eating foods they had placed on their \"don't eat list\" like lamb and beet. The service was excellent. It's a family owned business we were served by the owner who made great recommendations for an authentic experience. Her mother performed a coffee ceremony after the meal that was so enjoyable while her dad told us stories and shared culture. We'll definitely be back!",

Since it was my first order I tried a few things -- awaze lamb tibs, with fasolia (green beans and carrots) and the beet and potato side added on. Plus some extra injera, because who doesn't need extra injera?  That's definitely enough for two full on meals so don't get carried away with your order unless you like leftovers. The awaze tibs was super flavorful and spicy but not overpowering. The beet and potato was really good -- I've never seen that dish at an Ethiopian place before but it is my new favorite. The injera was springy and fresh, probably some of the best I've had in this town. Only complaint is that the container let the ater mix completely with the awaze tibs because the delivery person didn't keep it flat, but it was delicious anyway. I can only imagine it will be much better right out of the kitchen.",

The Tomoato Fit Fit and the lentil salads were very interesting and some had flavors that were new to me.The warm veggies were really good as well, especially the collards and the carrot and bean mix. The injera bread was best I ever had. It was soft and tasted a bit like a good sourdough bread. The service was outstanding too. Very friendly and very willing to explain anything on the menu or even how to eat with the injera bread. The best part was the complimentary coffee they served us at the end of the meal. The roasted fresh Ethiopian coffee beans right in front of you, then ground them and made a fresh coffee served like an espresso. The coffee was a perfect ending to the meal. I highly recommend you try Enat. Even if you do not live nearby, it is worth the drive to go there.",

The restaurant is in a shopping center but once you walk in it feels like you've travelled across the world to Ethiopia and are immersed in the culture. The restaurant has such a nice vibe and is cozy and quaint! The smells of wonderfully seasoned food mixed with Ethiopian music really help to add to the experience! The staff were super knowledgeable and very friendly. There's a really cool dictionary on the side of the menu that describes what the different foods are. It's a very nice touch!! Tina (the owner) greeted us with a smile and took the time to explain the different dishes and answer our questions. She also made sure to stop by the table to check and see how we were enjoying the meal. This was truly a wonderful experience ! But hey you don't have to take my word for it. Go see for yourself!!",

The staff was courteous and arranged seating to accommodate us. I chose the lamb tibs, shiro stew and enjera. The lamb was cooked to perfection. The sauce is a blend of special spices and seasonings with diced tomatoes, onions & jalepenos. The shiro stew was fantastic. I'm a big fan of chickpeas and this didn't disappoint. The enjera was spongey and slightly bitter. If it was seasoned, it would take away from the complexities of the food. It's a small family business, so I wasn't even upset that my food came out WAY after everyone else's (there were 15 of us). The highlight was Enat (mother) fixing coffee for us. The ceremony was interesting to watch and the aroma from the beans filled the restaurant with a pleasant, smokey ambiance. I'll definitely return, just without 14 other people!",

    "text": "I have been to a number of Ethiopian restaurants in Charlotte and prior to coming to Enat, I was ready to give up on the cuisine.  This place is, by far, the best Ethiopian food that I have tried.   The space is very small and unassuming, but clean and neatly decorated.  It is in a little shopping complex off of Plaza.  The menu is smallish, but in a nice touch they give definitions of many of the Ethiopian terms.  There is a cooler in the front with juice, water, and sodas  - no alcohol is sold.  It seemed like the person serving us was an owner/manager as she knew everything about the food and even the Armhaic letters on the wall.  The service was quick as the restaurant was empty when we arrived.  My wife had Kifto 360 which was some sort of spiced meat patty with cream cheese pressed between two tortillas and sliced like a pie.  She absolutely loved it.  As a main dish I had the lamb nibs, while my wife had the vegetarian platter.  Everything came out on one plate, with a side dish of rolled up enjera (slightly sour, spongy bread that you use to pick up the food in lieu of utensils.)  The lamb nibs were excellent and I liked the green beans and cabbage and carrots as well from the vegetarian platter.  The vegetarian platter had 8 different combos so it is great to sample from. Everything was just a touch spicy which was great.  The prices were not super cheap, but very reasonable both for the quality and quantity of food that we got. I would definitely go back.",

We be heard great things about Enat (which means \"mother\"), and decided to make the drive to check them out.    First off, the servers couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  They could tell we were new, and offered helpful suggestions on what to order.  We started with a combo of the chicken and lentil sambusas.  I thought I'd prefer the lentil, but I actually preferred the chicken.  Since the lentil was a tad spicier, my husband preferred them.  We had one large piece of enjera topped with the vegetarian combo, and my husband's lamb tibs.  Our favorites were the chickpeas, collards, cabbage, green beans, and lentils.  We preferred the hot over the cold items, and the only thing we didn't really like was the salad, since it was almost impossible to eat with enjera.  The portions were huge, and we couldn't eat it all.    We loved the food, and will return if we are in the area.",

    "text": "This is my go to Ethiopian restaurant in Charlotte.  The food and service are consistent, I have yet to be disappointed. I happily drive quite a ways to dine here.  Ambience: Enat is small, but cute. And quite functional. There are about 9 tables total. No booth seating. There's also a to go counter up front. The walls are painted with saying and Ethiopian paintings are hanging. It sets the mood.   Service: The upside to such a quaint place is the attentive service. It's hard to get over looked. They are very accommodating and will answer and questions you may have. If it's your first time trying Ethiopian food, ASK QUESTIONS! They are eager to answer, and want to make your dining experience great.  The food (the best part): The owner is usually the one cooking. She's awesome. She'll take requests and modify your dishes accordingly. We always start with Sambusa. They are pastry pockets filled with beef or lentils (go with the lentils). I am a huge fan of trying Ethiopian hot tea, their's has more cinnamon and not as much cardamom and ginger. But it's still good.  I always order the fish tibs, cabbage and miser. It's amazing. Especially if you add the awaze sauce to the fish.   All in all, switch it up for once. Go try something new!",

The vegetarian platter was huge.  Almost too much to reasonably eat in one sitting but my wife helped me.  This is the third Ethiopian restaurant we have been to in the Charlotte area and Enat is now our favorite.  If you are in the mood for Ethiopian food go here.  p.s. For those not familiar with Ethiopian restaurants- food is served family style (on a platter usually) with a spongy flatbread called injera/enjera.  Tradition has it that you tear off a piece of bread and pick up your food with it (traditionally with the right hand).  All the places we have been to offer silverware but who doesn't want to be a kid again and eat with your hands (smile).",

I ordered the vegetarian combo without the enjera (remembering trying it before and not liking it).  The combo includes 9 samples of their vegan offerings and I was impressed with the majority of of them.  I also ordered the sabusa stuffed with lentils and they were amazing but very spicy and served with a great tasting sauce.  The restaurant is very small in a strip mall with other restaurants and stores.  The staff was very pleasant, and made sure I had everything I needed before leaving.  The size of the platter was pretty huge, even for my takeout order.",

I got the vegan combo for $12. There was a nice variety of veggie dishes to try and tons of different flavors in this one dish. I was particularly fond of these darker lentils, not sure what dish it was. The lenitls had a subtle horseradish flavor to them. The meal came with plenty of spongy inerja bread to pick up the veggies with. I'll be sure to order from here again, it's a fresh change from greasy fast food. My only issue is the portions look bigger in the dine-in pics, but I don't know how large the plates are in reference to a takeout container.",

I want to keep saying that but you will stop reading.  I hate beets, I ate a dish of beats I was neutral about.  Neutral for something I hate is an act if wizardy.  The things I didn't have ingredient wise I loved.  Money: you get plenty of perfect spongy bread included, you can buy more for $3, I didnt need to.  Usually I run out of bread, big shout out to the operators that understand Americans can't mentally handly paying for bread.  Portions are large enough I had leftovers and I was hungry when I rolled in.  I have vegan family and friends, I dread disappointing them.  The food here makes me happy and will make them happy.  I can even eat vegan and not cry myself to sleep.  My tongue and stomach won't mind it at all.  Get a sampler if you don't know the food.  They have a superior version of the samosa here, order it.  I always like tibs, i prefer crunchy but the saucy one is great too.  The food isn't too hot, you can makw your face melt or you can order no spicey.",

The staff was beyond helpful, I was honest with them and told them that I'd only had Ethiopian a couple of times prior and asked for some guidance through the menu.  First thing, they highly recommended we move to a larger table (due to the Ethiopian style playing and their portion sizes) even though there was just two of us - Good Call!  I had lamb Tibs - per the staff's recommendation - that was insanely well-flavored and I couldn't stop with the Injera!   After trying our hardest to eat everything on the table, we had to throw in the towel, but, I'll be back!   Enat was a great experience. I was very happy with the hospitality of the staff and that coupled with the delicious food and the portion sizes easily make this a 5-Star eatery!

It's injera (sourdough sponge like flat bead) soaked in a lightly spicy sauce with tomatoes. Sooo good.  Beef tibs are pieces of ribeye meat seasoned Stirfry and stewed. It was nice and tender and so flavorful  Kitfo is African beef tartare mix with spicy buttery seasoning. You can have in a little bit cooked if you want. I like mine raw. Well done melts in your mouth.  Ayib is cottage cheese sprinkle on top.  If you like Indian food you would like African food without the curry or have a cinnamon spice  I've eaten at every Ethiopian restaurant in Charlotte and this place by far makes the best kitfo.   It is a nice cozy place with good service and good quality food. The veggie firfir put it over the top and earn the place a 5 stars.   If you've never eaten Ethiopian food I recommend you try the vegetarian dishes and the beef tips.",

I wish the water was colder than room temperature but it's not a big deal.  The food was delicious.  We got the sambusas with lentils and they came out piping hot with a nice dipping sauce.  I love the injera bread and the server brought more without us even asking which was awesome.  The vegetable plate was a sensory experience.  It was so colorful and each food tasted different.  My favorite was the cabbage.  I didn't care for the salad or tomato fitfit but everything else was great.
