I came with about 12 other people and we all really enjoyed our meals as they were served up, on time and hot. We ordered a wide variety of dishes to share and all of them were delicious; from pork belly, to fish filet(yum) to sesame chicken! I had the spicy chicken and veggie entree and man was is good! The spice level was perfect and oh so tasty! I definitely recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait to return!",

They repeat your order to make sure it's correct.  To be honest we always order the \"Americanized\" dishes (sesame chicken, general tso, etc.) And they are slightly above average.  Not epic.  However they have a full Authentic Chinese food menu, and judging by the clientele, it must be very good.  Overall we love this place",

I have been a few times and it's best to go with a lot of people and eat family style. Food is pricey, but you pay for the premium of the style of cooking and the authenticity of flavors.  I recently went with some coworkers, everyone thought it was awesome. We ordered 10 dishes for 7 people and final bill was about $25 a person. Pricey, but worth it if you have a craving for authentic Chinese food in Charlotte... Plan on spending $20 for food and a $5 for a drink.",

We also love their sweet pork in bone. Its bite size pork in bone pieces that is braised with thinly sliced onion in a sauce. It was very tender. The twice cooked pork is great, and the snow pea tips.    Every time we go, we always get at least 4 dishes. And about 6 adults would need that many each time. Every dish, each time, has not disappoint. The restaurant is smaller, so if you plan on going with a bigger party, call ahead. The staff is very nice and good service.",

I have to admit I'm pretty picky when it comes to Asian food; being half Asian nothing is as good as mom makes. Lee's Cafe filled that void. I love this place..fast, not greasy, authentic dishes and great price can't beat that.  We got General Tso' chicken and Mongolian beef. It was a sizable portion for the price. Chicken was crispy and sweet. I'm determined to try their sushi on the next visit.",

    "text": "Ok, this review is based on 2 trips. I didnt want to leave a review based on only my 1st trip. I live near this restaurant and heard good things since they opened/took over the old Chinese restaurant. First time trying, I just ordered a couple staple classic dishes; beef lo-mein & mooshu pork. The lo mein was so bland, had absolutely no flavor. The beef was chewy and had a really weird texture & flavor. Ended up picking out the rest and throwing it away. The Moo Shu was better but very bland also. Had to actually use the soy sauce packets to add flavor. Decent portions. If I were to base my rating on this meal, I would've given 1 star. There were alot of Chinese people eating there, and my friend that highly recommended them was Chinese as well. So I figured I would give them another chance, and this time order from the \"authentic Chinese\" menu I've been hearing about. This time I ordered; Steamed Flounder with ginger & scallions, Mapo tofu with pork, and Snow Pea tips.  1. The flounder was tiny and thin. Flavor was good, but it was $23! It was maybe worth $12 tops. Full of bones too. 2. The Mapo Tofu was really good, but you could barely tell there was any pork in it. Would order it again, but without pork to pay for this time. Great size portion. 3. The Snow Pea tips were awesome. No complaints, good size. These 3 dishes cost me $50. Grrrrrrr... But this order would get 3-4 stars. So I thought it would be fair to call it at 3 stars, to be kind.",

The fried rice that came with it had no flavor, nothing but rice,  just looks brown. The shrimp were tiny and tastelsss. Beef and brocolli was alright, nothing special. We didn't get any duck sauce at  all. Fried noodles were in a tiny bag and tasted like they were fried in old oil. Back in Charlotte, Ma Ma Wok rocked.

A completely satisfying experience both with our meals and service.",

They have all your standard \"Americanized\" dishes but also have sections of the menu serving Cantonese and Szechuan specialities. We stuck to the Szechuan side and ordered the wantons, beef tendon and spicy Szechuan beef. Everything was great with the wantons being my favorite! That sauce on them!! Will be coming back for all of my future Chinese cravings!",

The garlic chicken was very good and the sauce was light and did not seem to contain tons of corn starch like most Chinese places.   On my latest visit for dinner with my dinner group, we ordered a bit of everything from the traditional menu.  For appetizers the Szechuan Wontons were amazing! I couldn't get enough of the sauce. The tempura shrimp was also good as well as the steamed dumplings.  For entrees we shared the chili chicken, Szechuan beef, salt and pepper tofu, a pork dish and a triple protein dish whose names I cannot remember. The highlight for me was the chili chicken. It can smothered in chilies but the sliced ginger is what made it phenomenal.  The tofu was the surprise! It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   The staff here is amazing, very friendly and spot on service wise.  Prices are very affordable for huge portions.  This has now become my favorite Chinese restaurant I the Charlotte area!",

It's simply amazing.   In reality there are 2 Lee Cafes. There's the Americanized Chinese food version on the front of the menu. Pretty standard fare. And then there is the authentic Chinese version in the back of the menu. And my oh my is it authentic.   When the waitress (who was PHENOMENAL) saw my wife and I perusing the dishes in the back of the menu she brought us a tablet where we could scroll through a TON of \"real\" dishes (photo and English names for each). When the waitress learned we both spoke Chinese it got real and we started talking about the different dishes. My wife and I picked three dishes for lunch: Seafood and Tofu Claypot, Spicy Fish, and Chinese Water Spinach (kongxincai). The third dish wasn't on the menu but when we talked with the waitress we learned it was in season and available. At her suggestion we also had it prepared the Southern Chinese way.   The flavor of each dish was incredible. It felt like we were in Taiwan or Southern China instead of South Carolina. My wife, who was born in Taiwan and grew up in the US, said it reminded her of her father's home cooking. The claypot had flavors I haven't tasted since my last trip to Taiwan in 2011. The spicy fish was epic; just the right flavor and spice.   My wife and I didn't talk too much during lunch as we were busy stuffing our mouths. Each bite tasted better than the last. It's pretty rare to find a good Chinese restaurant in the States. I had Lee Cafe bookmarked on Yelp for a year but slept on it until today. I have a lot of time to make up for. My tummy is already thanking me.   I'm stingy on stars but this one deserves five of them. Highly recommend.",

There are three menus: Lunch which is Americanized, Cantonese which looks delicious, and Szechuan which is fantastic looking. You cannot beat the beer prices. They will show you pictures on a tablet of the menu items and answer all questions. Be aware, the traditional menus are family size. So she got the pepper steak, I got the family portion garlic pork with white rice. I'm going to stop here for now and say ours was good, very good. Now, on to what my husband ordered which the whole table fell in love with: salt and pepper fish with veggies (on the family portion menu). I have NEVER had a lightly battered fish that had so much flavor and melted in my mouth. It was AMAZING. And the little cabbages in the garlic white sauce... I'm almost salivating thinking about it again. I can see why this cafe has been in the local news. If you want REAL Chinese food, GO HERE. EAT. DRINK. LAUGH. You will not be disappointed, even the waitresses were kind and accommodating and full of information.",

All the yelp photos helped us tremendously as well as our server, whom patiently recommended dishes once we bombarded her with questions.  We over-ordered of course, but that means we had leftovers available for later (and we got to try a lot of things in one sitting).  The szchenuan wontons were amazing... (hopefully you are a fan of spicy since this place does have a lot of options with all things pepper on them).  The twice cooked pork was awesome as well.  Make sure to ask your server about their season items like the veggies and their specials!  Overall, it was located in a strip mall but had a ton of tables... seemed like there were a lot of people and some reserved booths for the regulars.  The space had either just been remodeled and kept neat and tidy.... almost a 50's soda shop type feel inside.  Regardless of the decor, the food definitely was the star... and I had to almost roll myself out the door like Violet Beauregard in the chocolate factory.",

    "text": "I know that comparing Charlotte (technically Fort Mill) Chinese food to New York is a little unfair. There are just more Cantonese people up there so the options are endless but after eating at Lee Cafe I will no longer need to wait until my trips up north to get good Cantonese/Szechuan style dinner.   My suggestion is to go in a larger group so you can order entrees and do it family style. If you have never had Szechuan before, Most dishes come out with a ton of Szechuan peppercorn but they are thicker and harder to chew so if you don't want it spicy they are easily avoidable.  When we sat down, we got a ton of menus. We got a sushi menu, a Chinese menu, and a regular menu. I strongly think you should go out of your comfort food when you try this place. There are not a lot of places in the area that have authentic dishes. So if you see a dish that you could get in a food court in the mall, try something else! Not because it wouldn't be good at Lee Cafe but because your taste buds will be in for a treat!   The Szechuan Wonton (Which was pork and had pieces of whole shrimp, not minced) were delightful. The best part was the sauce the wontons were in. Super flavorful!!! We loved it so much in fact after we finished the wontons we saved the plate of sauce to pour over our white rice.   Dry-fried Green Beans  Hands down! The best garlic green beans I have ever had. I don't know what dry fried means but the green beans were bright and plump and had a crisp bite to them but were not oily. They came out with a ton of garlic and everyone at the tables loved them!!  We also got the Beef Chow Fun which is a guilty pleasure for me, I personally always love any kind of fat noodle so it's really hard for me to review this because I'm biased. But guys at the table after the fact said we should have opted for a more traditional dish.  We also got the Spicy Chili Chicken which is also dry fried. It was a little tough for me but still tasted good.   So long story short, I will be coming back. There are SOO many things I want to try like MAPO tofu, the sushi here and basically all the things that say Szechuan in front of it! Enjoy!!",

I am actually very surprised this place exists since Charlotte does not have a large asian population at all but I am so happy they are  here! They provide lunch specials and the more American chinese takeout options but they also have a menu full of sze chuan specialties!   We got the garlic eggplant, ganguo cauliflower and pork belly, and lazi chicken. Everything was good, their eggplant is on point, it was $9, cauliflower and pork belly was very good but was $20 so a little steep, and lazi chicken was actually my least favorite, about $9. Everything could have used more spiciness! I feel like they have been forced to tone it down because of the majority of the their clientele.   Parking is shared with the Publix next to it. The owner was very nice and gave us a lot of recommendations.",

Checked back frequently but not too much.  Excellent  -- Food was served piping hot.   It looked fresh as well.    -  love that they have brown rice as an option.  Not everyone does.   It was delicious.   -- Steamed veggies were really good.  Fresh broccoli, carrots, zukes, pea pods, mushrooms, nappa cabbage.  All steamed perfectly.   Definitely a highlight.    The not as good: -- I had the kung pao chicken.   While the flavor was good, some of the chicken was a little fatty which was weird since I was told it was all white meat.   I stopped eating it and focused on the peanuts and cashews only.   -- they don't have sushi!   It's in the name, yet they didn't have sushi so if you are looking for that, find another restaurant.    I'd be back for sure, but wasn't blown away and would probably not order a chicken dish again.",

I have been fortunate enough to have \"Jenny\" as my server on both visits. The visual menu on a tablet is extremely helpful but Jenny's clear explanation of the dishes was even better!  She encouraged us to go outside of our comfort zone and not order \"typical Chinese food\".  So yeah, there's like an entirely different menu for the more traditional Chinese dishes...don't be scuurd, you'll only be disappointed if you don't give it a shot! :)  We ordered the Szechuan Wontons...OMG...soooooo good!  They are pretty spicy so beware if you're sensitive to spicy and bold flavors. The lettuce wraps were also very good!  Servings are made for sharing so keep that in mind if you go solo.",

My search is now over - and they really exceeded my expectations.   I'd say that my review is based on the traditional Chinese menu, with many traditional Szechuan offerings and also a few Cantonese items such as the beef chow fun as well.  The two dishes I had were both very authentic. No corners were cut (see pics I posted), and i dare say that they are the only Chinese place in Charlotte I know of so far who knows how to cook Chinese/Szechuan dishes properly. I can't wait to go back to experience their other offerings on the traditional menu.",

Spicy tofu was the answer.  The entire time it appeared we were just a speed bump in the waitresses day.   Well, turns out there's pork in it.  We sent it back and they remade it - but it tasted so heavily of pork my wife couldn't eat it.  It actually churned her stomach.  I tried it, enjoying many types of food, it was definitely pork.   Our waitress never came back by so I stopped another, she kept trying to get us another plate of something even though I kept explaining she can't eat anything now.   It appeared we weren't the only customers with an issue with this waitress and it's a really small place!

    "text": "Lee Cafe was recommended by friends as the the best/most authentic Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area, so we checked it out. It's located right down the road from Carowinds. We were there for lunch and had no problem getting a table. At first glance of the menu given, the dishes were not that different from what you would find in any mall food court: General Chicken, Mongolian Beef, etc. I got the Beef with Broccoli which came with egg fried rice...again, mall food court fare and tasted as such. As I looked around the dining room, I noticed other parties with elaborate dishes and asked the waitress about some of them. She gave us another menu with \"authentic\" Chinese dishes listed. This is why we came! She pointed out some dishes we saw and we made note of it for our return trip the next day.  So we finally ended up trying the Salt & Spices Tofu (breaded deep fried tofu), Sizzling Steak Black Pepper Sauce (brought out on a hot skillet similar to fajitas), and the Szechuan Spicy Fish Filet. The tofu was all right, seasoned well although maybe it could've been served with a dipping sauce the way Vietnamese fried tofu is served (or is that just a Vietnamese thing, IDK). The sizzling steak had an authentic ethnic/Chinese (I guess) taste to it, but the more I ate, the more I enjoyed! However, it was the Szechuan Spicy Fish Fillet that we were eager to try. This is the dish that everyone was eating! It came out in a large bowl with nothing but fried chilies on top. The fish was underneath the chilies swimming in chili oil and bean sprouts. My mistake was popping a piece of fish into my mouth right away without letting it cool first, thereby burning my tongue. I wasn't wowed as much as my wife was over this dish. It was just OK. I'm not sure if it was because I burned my tongue, but I found it very bland. Oh well, there are lots of other dishes on the real menu to explore. If you're the adventurous type, ask for the authentic Chinese menu when you're here!",

The second server was absolutely horrendous. He kept referring to my aunt as \"lady\", he would be like \" hey lady, whatcha want?\". There was a very inconvenient language barrier. When they came back to the table they were very rude and stubborn for example, when telling them they're mistaken, he would argue back and forth with me and my aunt. They were fighting over one of our dinner combinations and 2 crab rangoons that come with it. They also told us that they were out of diet coke to refill our glasses but that was surprising because they had a fountain machine which they had actually locked because it was getting close to closing time. I mean you have customers sitting and they are paying so they deserve to get not just the service but also the food they are paying for. Just a terrible experience and service to match with mostly mediocre food, and of course on top of that they pre added a 18% tip. It almost seems to me that they have nothing to lose on parties of 6 or more because they get their tip regardless. I would not recommend this place and especially if you plan to go with a large party.",

I will say the rest of the traditional style dishes Sichuan are still pretty good. Last note: they are now offering Cantonese style dishes too.   I am not ready to downgrade my rating but I am thinking about.... below is my original post.)   Sichuan Chinese is starting to come the Charlotte area, finally. This is first really, really good Sichuan food that is consistently frequented by many Asians from the area.   The atmosphere is sufficient and the service is typically to friendly Chinese style.   Sichuan Wonton in Chili Oil - very good, not my favorite but get this pretty often Spicy Chili Chicken - Chinese peppery and numbing, nice crispy, saltiness and citrus flavor. This dish is so good, if you like this then you're a True Sichuan lover.  Fish in Hot Chili Oil - the fish is soft, supple and flavorful with plenty of bean spouts. The bean spouts is that tastiness that I ever had because bean spouts are usually so bland.  Beef in Hot Chili Oil - good, would get a again... the fish was better Sizzling Beef - again, really good and worth trying Twice Cooked Pork - nice pork belly dish with plenty of flavor",

Upon arrival, a sign says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" So we waited, and waited, and finally we were acknowledged and seated. We noticed a lot of other Asians in the cafe, which we felt was a good sign (since same ethnicity usually means authentic and quality). It took another 10 minutes for anyone to come by and ask us what we wanted, or give us some water. One of the servers was practically running from table to table, while the others just seemed to take their time.   Our server finally arrives and apologizes as it was a \"food rush\" (okay, 1:30pm is not exactly \"lunch time\"). Firstly, there are too many menus. We were given 3 menus to choose from (lunch specials, specials, regular menu). Food arrives in separate deliveries (lunch orders should arrive together; this is not a-la-carte). The sweet-and-sour soup was good, not too spicy. The wonton soup lacked flavor. One of the menus seemed to list authentic \"home town cooking\" (if you like sheep intestines).   Food was okay overall, definitely not a '5' as many have raved. Sub-standard service brings this rating down from a would-be \"4\". Bad experience, won't return.",

We love it here in the South, but we have discovered that really good Chinese restaurants in the Midlands are rare. Since we are only an hour away from Charlotte, NC, I decided to research Sichuan (aka Szechuan) restaurants in Charlotte. Through Yelp! we came across Lee Cafe in Fort Mill, SC, a suburb that is south of Charlotte across the state border. My wife and I decided to try it this past Easter Sunday. We ordered the Szechuan wontons, the spicy Szechuan chicken (aka Chongqing spicy chicken), twice cooked pork, and spicy eggplant. We were treated to some wonderfully prepared dishes complete with tongue-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilis. My wife and I agreed that the food here could stand up to the authentic Sichuan cuisine we enjoyed in California for so many years. It was so good, in fact, that we went back the next weekend when we picked up our son at the Charlotte airport. This time, we tried the Ma Po Tofu and Taiwanese cabbage along with the Szechuan wontons and spicy Szechuan chicken. Yes, this was definitely more food than two people could consume, but we planned to have plenty extra to bring back home to savor. I cannot speak to their sushi or more traditional Chinese-American dishes, but their Sichuan dishes are definitely on-point.",

I said my order and asked to make it spicy and she acted like I asked for gold and got more attitude. Then I asked I order egg fried rice and she said they only have small size but in a rude way. I asked her to make it spicy and she said they don't make that fresh it's pre-maid. I asked to make it fresh which any other Chinese spot would make it and she said no. I said to cancel my order which she didn't care for. I like to support local businesses but hate when a business gets cocky since they have great reviews and stops caring about customer service. Owner really needs to get this things right that service is also important as great food. I don't like to catch a attitude and bad service when I am paying them for food.

It is basically their Szechuan style fish filet. Fish fillets and chili peppers and peppercorns are placed inside a bowl as extremely hot oil is placed into the bowl which melds all the flavors together while cooking it.  The dish is supposed to be very spicy but the preparation here may have been tamed down a little bit, I didn't find it spicy at all, which was disappointing! I was also only given one bowl of rice for a large family style dish.   Service was good.   All in all still a good experience. Would likely return!",

    "text": "For years, Chinese restaurant after restaurant cycled through this spot. Lee Cafe, however, has broken the curse, and it's not hard to see why.  I came here with two friends on a Friday night. The restaurant was pretty busy but we were nonetheless seated quickly. The waitress who helped us throughout the night--and I say this as a person who dines out almost every day--has to be the most accommodating and personable server I've ever encountered. From the moment we sat down, she was on hand to answer every possible question. She clearly knew the menu well, and--unlike a lot of other places--was more than willing to give her honest opinion on who should be trying what.  The restaurant offers authentic Sichuanese and Cantonese food; I didn't order any of the authentic dishes because, per the waitress's recommendation, they're best eaten family style (and my friends, alas, did not prove receptive to the idea). Instead, I opted for the hot and sour soup (good, but not the best I've had--I would have liked it a bit more sour), the octopus nigiri (fine, but my least favorite order from the night), and the eel nigiri (excellent, with wonderful flavor and texture). I ordered the orange chicken as my entree. At first, I wasn't crazy about it, but it rapidly grew on me.  All in all, I can say that this has to be the best easy sit-down Chinese place of eaten at in the Charlotte area. It avoids the greasiness a lot of other places seem to embrace while delivering hearty flavors and the service is truly exceptional, and I cannot wait to return (with better company) to sample some authentic dishes.",

This is what you will find in China and the big-city Chinatowns: fresh, flavorful, quickly served fare. Granted, it can be a little daunting if you are not familiar with the dishes. However, the staff is always willing to help; just ask for it (they have pictures to guide you as well). As for the greeting at the door, simply attract their attention and you will be seated. This is a hardworking staff.",

There's something different about this Chinese place compared to so, so many others camped out in Food Lion shopping centers throughout the South.  So many of those other places often feel so gimmicky. Cheap meals with a front of being authentic Chinese. While I've only had the lunches here so far (which fit firmly into the \"standard American Chinese food\" category) I get the feeling that they're legit here. They're not actually strictly staffed by Chinese people. Oddly enough, that's indicator number one that they might be authentic.  Anyways, staff here has always been super nice and helpful. Easily among the friendliest staff I've met at a Chinese restaurant. They actually take time to talk to you and get to know you. They sport mini iPads for taking orders and I'm sure that enables them to get to tables quickly without having to run orders back to the kitchen constantly. I've never met with a delay on receiving my food here.  The food flavor and quality isn't anything to write home about. Again, basing this entirely on the lunch menu right now. I'd really like to take a shot at some more authentic stuff. I've had the sesame chicken and it's honestly a bit plain. But this won't stop me from going back in again for lunch. They move quickly and you can get full and pay tip for $8. See y'all again soon!",

The menu looks amazing, with several different cuisine types, and the less intimidating Americanized Chinese foods that we all know and love. The hot & sour soup was dark, full of ingredients and the perfect consistency (I like mine on the spicy side, and this version delivers). The sushi sampler was amazing; each piece was expertly constructed and delicious. No sauces were needed for the sushi. The entrees we ordered from the lunch menu were superbly prepared, tender, with ample portions. My husband ordered five delicacies (I think that was the name of it) with added spice. Both the fried and white rice were wonderful as well. We forgot to order egg rolls... next time I'll remember them, for sure. So excited to have a great Chinese and sushi place less than two miles from my door step.",

    "text": "Having seen all the raving reviews wife and I decided to visit last night for dinner.  Expecting to wait a little bit even on weekday evening, we were surprised that no wait at all.  Actually only 3 or 4 tables were occupied.  Nonetheless we were happy not having to wait.  We studied the two sets of menu, Cantonese and Sichuan (no sushi on Tuesday) and settled on 3 dishes, all fairly authentic Chinese.  The waitress was very helpful and friendly.   The duck dish came first since it is a cold (room temperature) dish.  Duck was brined in salt and spice liquid then steamed and let cool down before serving.  Portion is good, so is the flavor.  Second dish was a spicy dish with battered and fried fish fillet pan fried with cilantro and red hot chili pepper in just a little bit of oil.  Fish is fresh and flaky but the batter is a little chewy.  We have had better, but it still gets a passing grade from us.  The last dish was deep fried tofu with sauteed vegetables.  The dish had to be prepared only upon ordering so it took the longest, we were told.  Tofu was a little crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside; exactly the way it should be.  The vegetables were not overcooked and still had some crunchiness.  The sauce was also pretty good which gives flavor to the tofu.  We were pleasantly surprised at the end, not so much by the quality, or selection, of the dishes, but by the fact  restaurants such as this serving fairly authentic Chinese food actually exist and even thrive around Charlotte.  We were also told that the restaurant has not 1 or 2, but 4 chefs, including a Japanese sushi chef.  It is difficult to fathom how busy the place has to be on the weekend to support the large staff.  Wish the best to the owner and the staff.",

I would like to go back and try more of the authentic Szechuan dishes and the sushi.",

They have a great lunch special  at $5.95 with quite a few selections. I had the spicy Sa Cha chicken which was outstanding.  The spring rolls were the best, I've ever had, nice and  crunchy with a distinctive flavor...not mushy like most others.  It's big dining room, you can sit at the bar or if you have a group, they have two private dining rooms.  They have outside dining if the weather suits, hope you don't mind a view of the parking lot, but hey, if the weather is nice, who cares.  A very extensive menu, they have take out and a dedicated service line for take out/pick up.  The real thing here is the sushi, they have their own Sushi Chef and a dedicated sushi bar.   You know they must be doing something right when the place is packed on a Thursday at lunch time.  They don't deliver and they don't do Dim Sum.",

Don't get me wrong, the sushi lunch special is great, 100% order accuracy and friendly service when I pick it up (keep in mind as the door states no sushi on Tuesdays) but the dinner service was the real star.   We were promptly seated and given menus. Our waitress was so excited to tell us all about the food and then she brought over an ipad with pictures so we could see everything. She enthusiastically gave recommendations that we took her up on.   First we split the Szechuan dumplings. They are listed on the cold appetizers menu but came out hot when we ordered them. They were phenomenal! They are pork filled dumplings with a shrimp each served in chili oil. My favorite item of the meal. Fiance ordered the Szechuan beef which is a huge soupy bowl of beef and cabbage and a delicious blend of spices. I ordered the spicy veggie & shrimp which came in a heated wok that our waitress lit at the table. It was delicious and had abundant amounts of shrimp. On one of her passes by our table to deliver someone else's meal the waitress stopped for a second to show me the dish if I had ordered the fish instead. How great is it that she was so excited about the food that she wanted to show me the other option that I was thinking of?  Everything was enjoyable from the food to the service, we will definitely make this a regular stop!",

I recently moved to Fort Mill from about 10 miles away and needed to find good Chinese Food.  Well, here it is.  Service has always been amazing even in tough, busy times.  It does get busy so expect a short wait.  They have a bar area that I've seen people choose just so they can be served.    I'm not too educated on Szechuan cuisine but was open to try things.  I've had the Spicy Szechuan Wontons, Spicy Szechuan Beef and they were both awesome and full of flavor!  The flavors are heavy in chili and chili oil with hints of soy.  These are a must have.  My family isn't big on meat so I had to order the wontons by myself and OH MAN this is one dish I don't want to share.  Next visit I had the spicy chicken in a wok.  Served hot, in a wok (duh), and again, full of flavor!!!    Just last night, I had the hunan beef which was nicely spiced, colorful with many vegetables and amazing.  I couldn't eat it all so I'm looking forward to today's lunch.  I highly recommend Lee Cafe and am excited about seeing you next weekend for something new to try!!!",

And you could tell it was super fresh. When I ordered fruit as the dessert for our dinner combos I thought it'd be like mixed melon and/or berries but it ended up being slices of orange. I wasn't upset about it because they were very sweet and ripe. In normal Chinese take out fashion it was more than enough food so I filled up fast.

    "text": "While visiting the Steele Creek area, I wanted Asian food. Lee cafe was the highest ranking spot so I made my way there. Though it's in Fort Mill, SC it's a quick drive. This restaurant had the potential to be a 4 or 5 star, but they fell short. Let me explain why.  Ambience: The restaurant is located in a strip mall, near fantastic Sam's. It's spacious with plenty of booth and table seating. It was clean, well lit and offers a beer, wine and sake selection at the ample bar. Which also doubles as the takeout counter.   Service: This is one area where Lee Cafe lost stars. We waited to be acknowledged and seated for five minutes. There was no one working the front counter. Literally a full five minutes where staff walked past us, looked directly at us, and ignored us. We were about to leave, when a server finally came and seated us.  We explained to our server that it was our first visit. That I'm pescatarian and my bf is vegetarian. We asked for recommendations as well as inquiring about specific dishes. In the end he was no help at all. No explanations. He said \"this is all the veggie stuff, seafood is here.\" Pointed at the menu and walked away. (We later heard a sever offer a picture menu on an iPad to explain the dishes...side eye) There was a couple next to us that had something that smelled AMAZING! I inquired and was told it was the spicy fish with vegetables. So, I ordered that. My boyfriend got veggie fried rice.....  The food: His rice arrived in a matter of five minutes, seriously five. It was luke warm rice with a few small pieces of broccoli, carrots and zucchini. No seasoning, soy sauce, nothing. Terrible. He sent it back and sadly ordered 3 veggie spring rolls.  My food on the other had was PHENOMENAL! Well, expect the luke warm brown rice that accompanied it. The fish (flounder) was fried and came out sizzling in a wok. It was covered in garlic, peppers, ginger and scallions. With advice from the neighboring table I mixed it up really well and went to town.  The flavors were perfect, it was seasoned just right. I would go back, solely for that dish.   Overall there were some good and bad moments. We'd probably visit again, and request the picture menu.",

There was quite a bit of a wait and lots of people waiting, but my mom and I are patient people and waited, and let me just say, it was well worth it. The hostess was welcoming, despite being flooded by the number of people at the door. The menu had some classic American style Chinese food, but had plenty of authentic Cantonese options as well. They also served sushi, although I didn't get a chance to give any a try. Our food was served hot and was very fresh and was bursting with flavor.  Our waitress, although very busy, was kind and courteous and checked on us often and answered any questions we had. We aren't from the area, but would recommend this place to anyone looking for a twist on a classic.",

The staff is always so nice and helpful. Every time I go pick up my food, the restaurant is packed with people dining in and they get me in and out quickly. Their food is very good and tastes fresh, unlike a lot other Chinese places. I highly recommend giving them a try if you're in the area. They might become your go-to too!",

Based on feedback from coworkers the standard Chinese American dishes are above average as well , the service is super friendly, fast, and the plates are the perfect size . The prices match the pleasure your tummy will recieve with every bite and it's more than enough to share .   Try the salt and pepper porkchops if you are a pork fan. The snowpea tips were scrumptious as well. Our second time visiting the snowpea tips were not in matket so they had the fresh veggie of the day as a substitute . Love a prepared chef! I'm going back to try 90%of the menu.",

All in all, it's an excellent Chinese restaurant just inside the border of South Carolina in the Charlotte burbs, with pretty good Chinese stuff - much of it authentic.  The Mapo Tofu it was good but not amazing, whereas the Chongqing spicy chicken was more delicious - probably not spicy enough for me, and it did not have the numbing peppercorns from Szechuan region - but still very tasty.  Service was good and they served me late even though they were close to closing time, special commendations for that. Prices aren't bad, either, and nice hefty portions.",

    "text": "The lady below who said she can get $2.50 per sushi roll, I want to know where and if she got food poisoning.  Anyway, in all seriousness, I tried this place last night on new year's eve. They were packed. Around 13 tables inside, and a sushi bar. The sushi bar chef is actually Japanese, and his wife works as a waitress. On a any given day they have 4 waitresses, but last night, they were so busy I think I saw 5 or 6. There are 13 tables inside the restaurant. spacious and clean bathrooms.   Ordered off their Chinese menu (At the back of the regular menu): 1. Egg noodle stir fried with soy sauce $9.50. Pretty big portion. Nothing too spectacular but definitely tasty, sesame, onion stir fried egg noodle in soy sauce.  2. seafood tofu clay pot $16. Very good, but SUPER salty! I did not have enough rice to finish this dish because the salt content was so heavy. The seafood was generous portion and the tofu is not the fresh type but the tofu puff type, which I like. Great sauce, but again, too salty. All the waitresses here work together, you will not have the same waitress who took your order to bring out your food. A different waitress brought out our food and she mistakenly took our sea food clay pot to the table next to ours. She of course sincerely apologized, but I thought the logistics could have been worked out better. 3. Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce $10. This I thought was kind of overpriced, I mean I guess so is the seafood tofu clay pot if you were really getting down to the nitty gritty. The Chinese broccoli were cut up to smaller pieces so it's easier to eat, it was very tasty, but there weren't that much on the plate. Any non-noodle dishes that are not appetizers come with 1 small cup of rice, you get a choice of 1. egg fried rice, 2. white rice or 3. brown rice.  Service was very friendly and perky, definitely way superior than typical Chinese or Asian joints. Nothing sketchy here. They don't try to scam you, or do things that make you question why they did certain things. The whole experience was very comfortable. Lighting was great, seats were nice and so is the dining table. Overall nice ambiance.   I don't know many restaurants in Charlotte where you can order such authentic Chinese dishes, oh I was told the head chef here is from HK. However, this is the only authentic Chinese cuisine in Charlotte area I am able to locate that actually has good service and great ambiance.",

The proof is in the waiting area as many others agree this is a good place too eat so be mindful and stop running your mouth and let others sit and eat too.

The front window said open for lunch Monday through Thursday ok but then under it says closed Tuesday,  no problem, so we came yesterday and it was worth it.  We were greeted as soon as we stepped inside.  It was very cozy with nice tables with high back chairs and also several large sized booths.  They give you two menus for lunch one the usual and the other for sushi.  Nice selection. I ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce and my better half ordered chicken with cashews.  Both were very good in presentation and taste.  The service is very quick and thorough.   The food turnout is quick.  We truly enjoyed the meal and were surprised at the bill, $12 for both.  I now see why the reviews are all very good.  We will definitely be back  again.",

We ordered three dishes, beef cold cut, spicy fish filet and spicy chili chicken. I should say spicy chili chili chicken was awesome even compared the ones I have in China. But, the other two dishes were bad. The beef tasted weird and I don't know if it was because it was not fresh or they use some special flavor. The spicy fish filet came with lots of red pepper but it was not spicy at all!!! And not even smells good..... It is probably good for an American who wants to have a taste of real Chinese food, not the 'orange chicken', but I don't recommend it to people who want real ~finally, just a tip, you may need to make a reservation with them if over 2 people, this place is packed!",

They had already started cleaning up and had no other customers there, but still let us in (thank you!). I saw a review mention hot pot and was excited at the possibility of having good authentic Chinese food (something I haven't had since I lived in Boston) and was not disappointed! I got the seafood clay pot and my person got the Sichuan beef. When they brought it out, our eyes got huge at the portions. We thought \"we didn't bring enough people for this much food!\" We stated eating, and shocked ourselves by finishing everything. Both were incredible, but I wound up stealing his. The Sichuan beef left an awesome tingle all over my mouth and the service was incredible. Thank you again for staying open late for us!",

Be careful when you ask for chopsticks because they'll launch them at you.

Now on to the food and here is why I give it such a low rating. My date had Shrimp and Chicken broccoli which she said was the seafood was lukewarm and the rice was under cooked. I had the Cantonese Duck which was a HUGE mistake first off she showed me a picture of it before I ordered it and what the brought me was COLD BOILED DUCK. I'm not a complainer for the most part but when asked by the waitress I told her it was awful-Her response \"sorry\" next time order something else. So that was the nail in the coffin for me!! My advice AVOID this place like the plague!!",

The real Chinese combination menu. The real Chinese special menu. And I haven't even been there for dinner! Just ask for the real Chinese menu, they'll happily provide it and explain to you what everything is. They have a killer Hot Pot and Mapo Tofu, both dishes that are native to China.  For the americanized lunch combos, they will add a soft drink and dessert to your order! I get cake every time because why not.

The fella and I have been a couple of times, but I didn't want to write a review the first time because we both ordered the wrong thing, and I didn't want to slight the restaurant. If you're a huge Chinese food fan, order off the authentic menu; if you're not, stick with the usuals. Lesson learned!  We arrived at 6 pm on a Wednesday night, and there was only one other couple eating in. We were promptly greeted and seated in a booth, and we got great service the whole night. A ton of people came in for take-out, and it was a little busier when we left, so I think we just got there earlier than most.  For dinner, I got the beef and broccoli. It was a generous portion, and the meat tasted fresh. The brown sauce wasn't too salty, which I appreciated, and the brown rice was about what you'd expect. The fella got the dinner combination chicken and shrimp with broccoli, which came with an egg roll, veggie roll, or crab rangoon, and he went with the egg roll. Dessert was either cake or fruit, and he went with fruit, which was three orange slices. Interesting.  Two dinners and two glasses of wine were $31 + tip. Not too shabby for solid food and good service!",

Menu has a good variety of different Chinese foods- esp. different styles. Portion size is decent, but the best part is that the food came so fast even when it was fairly busy!   Random tidbits: 1. I love twice cooked pork but this one was more fatty than usual. If that's what you like, then go for it!  2. Please try the drunken chicken, it was so tender and delicious!  3. It seems like it can get busy fast due to limited seating, so it would be safe to make a reservation.  4.

This place is popular, but well deserved. Located in a grocery store shopping center, it's a hole-in-the-wall joint. The atmosphere, location, decor or even service won't draw you back, but the food will! Make sure you ask about their hot pot specials or additional evening specials. And check out the \"classic dishes\" portion of the menu. I highly recommend the Shanghai Cabbage, Double Cooked Pork and the Beef Chow Fun is delicious. The Szechuan Spicy Fish Fillet is good, but I thought the other dishes were much more flavorful while this was more for \"show\". I would say, it's hard to go wrong here, ask the servers for recommendations [or look at Yelp photos!]. The menu might be intimidating if you don't have experience with authentic cuisine, but just go for it--you won't be disappointed!",

I just got the regular garlic chicken and it was very good. The place was packed on a weeknight when i was there and it took a long time before someone took by to go order but now i know to just call ahead.   The menu is extensive and it looks like there are a lot of great choices but a lot of the cuisine sounded unfamiliar to me so next time I go I will bring a friend who knows a bit more about each dish so i can branch out from the basic americanized chinese dishes",

    "text": "Having lived in Charlotte for over 8 years and being Chinese, I can say with some authority that Lee Cafe is hands down the most authentic Chinese food in Charlotte. From the moment I walked in, I could tell this is the real deal. All the customers seated at that time were Chinese and if you are looking for authentic food, then that's a telltale sign of a great place. As with any Chinese restaurant, all food is served family style so bring as many friends and/or family as you can rally!   Food: I went with my mom and sister and since it was my first time there, we ordered an aggressive amount of food for a small family. Like champions, we basically ate everything it was so good. For appetizer, we started off with the Szechuan wontons (sorry I'm not sure of the exact translations of the foods) and it was amazing. The wonton was firm and filled with meat and shrimp and the chili oil was flavorful and reminded me of when I actually visited Szechuan. For the main dishes, we ordered Szechuan fish fillet, garlic eggplant, mapo tofu, and Beef chow fun (gan chao niu he). Every dish was flavorful, delicious and most importantly, very authentic. We loved spicy food so all our dishes were spicy, but they also have a large selection of non-spicy dishes. I would highly recommend what I ordered as they are very traditional Chinese dishes.   All in all, I am excited to finally have a great authentic Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.   Pro tip: Make sure to ask for the Chinese menu if you want the authentic dishes. Don't worry if you can't read Chinese, there is English translation on it.",

The food, the service, and cleaniness of the restaurant made it all an enjoyable, comfortable, and relaxing dinner.  It's off the beaten path, but they still managed to bring in a very diverse customer base (Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese).   I heard the sushi chef speaking Japanese to a Japanese customer so that was great to see.  I will definitely be coming back for more and can't wait to try other dishes from their Cantonese/Szechuan menu..maybe even sushi knowing now the chef is Japanese.",

Lobster sauteed in a ginger sauce  4. Grilled shrimp in a ?black soybean sauce Served with jasmine rice.    Service 5/10 Our 'assigned' waitress brought out the dishes, but no rice. We waited, but did not see her. So we tried to ask another waitress about it she scoffed and walked off saying she wasn't our waitress.  Pretty rude. Even if that were the case she should have said let me send your waitress to help you.   Cost: 1-3 Were $18-22 per dish and 4-$35. Not bad, but if you want the most food for your $ this isn't your place.   Overall pretty tasty food, but not quite as delicious as Wan Fu (my fave Chinese restaurant in 704) was back in the 90s-00s. Worth a try though. Planning to return and try some of the more classic Szechuan dishes.",

One menu is all in Chinese and the other Chinese with English translation. That tells me that people who can read Chinese eat here. Which further tells me I'm in the right place for the \"good stuff\".  So far, my favorite dishes are the Szechuan Spicy Beef, Mapo Tofu and Twice Cooked Pork. The flavors were spot on and reminded me of places I frequented in NYC; the portions are also very generous. The Appetizer Section has cold items that you would not expect, like Saliva Chicken, that I was admittedly not brave enough to order. Of course they have hot appetizers and soup. There's a sushi bar, but why get sushi when there's so much else to order?    So in the ongoing search for good Chinese in Charlotte, put this one on your \"to do \" list.",
