If you're driving by 51 and 485, stuck at CMC Pineville, or just need a good place to eat, this is the place.  If there is anything unusual about the menu, it's the depth. No matter your tastes, you'll find something you like; and it'll be good. I have yet to be disappointed there.  Eggs in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, and a filling dinner. On those days when I'm out and hungry, there's no better place to go.  When I tire of burgers and chicken fried steak, there's the Greek salad or giro. I like their chicken livers -- they're always good. Breakfast is breakfast. I order the way I want it, they cook it like I tell them and I eat it. That's worth a star all by itself.  The portions are generous and the prices reasonable. The wait staff are attentive without being clingy . . . unless you're a regular . . . then everyone from the owner on down stops by to say 'hello.'",

    "text": "Lord, where do I begin?  I have only eaten here once, but that was enough.  My father and I had breakfast there last summer mid morning and during the week so not at all busy.  We were seated promptly, asked what we would have to drink... and the wait began.  Finally a server reeking of just returning from her smoke break acknowledged our presence and took our order.  We also noted that we were still just waiting for our beverages that someone said they were going to get.  And we waited...  By the time our food finally arrived, I was out of water and my Dad coffee.  The waitress forgot our toast but would \"be right back\" with it.  Before we could say anything, she retreated to the kitchen as someone was calling her in the back.  She was never seen again.  And we waited...  Finally as we were finishing our meal, another waitress came with the check, conveniently while both of us had our mouths full so we didn't have a chance to ask for a refill or where the missing toast was.  Not a single word was even spoke.  We got up and paid to find the cashier on the phone having an argument with someone.  Never offered was a \"how was everything\" or even a note of the total due while still engaged in her heated conversation.  She just took his card and swiped it, laid the receipt down, and kept as she was before we approached her.  Maybe this was a one off experience at the restaurant, but it hasn't resoundingly wanted me to rush back since there are so many options for breakfast in the area.  I personally know someone who worked there a very short time leaving because of wage and tips (hint: be thoughtful of your customers and that may change).  I pass by the restaurant frequently, and they always seem to be hiring signs out front so this could be the root of the problem with high turnover of any possible quality staff.",

My friend's beef tips were coated with a very delicious seasoning! The gravy and onions and peppers were really a nice touch to add tons of flavor!

We waited between 5 and 10 minutes after having been seated for her to greet us.  She behaved the entire time like we were a total inconvenience.  We had to flag her down for drink refills and to bring my salad.  She brought me the wrong entree (fried not broiled, and perch not flounder) and never apologized.  My table mates were almost finished eating when I received my meal.  And while we sat visiting after eating, she never once asked if she could get us anything or offered us drink refills.

My husband and I ordered the ultimate omelette, steak omelette both with home fries and biscuits with country gravy. The waitress didn't know what country gravy was so we had to explain it to her. I also overheard the table behind us explaining to their server what poached eggs were...seriously? But back to the food...everything in the omelettes were very obviously from a can... the canned mushrooms were the worst. The steak tasted old.  The home fries were disgusting. they tasted like they had been sitting around for a few days and then thrown on a dirty griddle. The biscuits were from a can and the gravy was made from powder...and made very poorly.  All in all I just wanted to get out of there. We each left more than half the food on the plate because we just couldn't stomach it. I've never been to a restaurant in Charlotte where I couldn't eat the food it was so bad.  I don't know how or why it has so many 5 star reviews on Yelp. This just makes me even more skeptical now that Yelp reviews have let me down for the third time.  BTW NOT A GREEK DINER!",

Went to another place sat ordered drinks only to find they didnt serve breakfast (passed 11:00).  Welp. We ended up here. (Usually our 1st or 2nd option, I was near center city at the time which is the reason I started out at The Midnight Diner)  We come here at least 2 a month. Love the food. Great TEA.. Not too sweet. Great prices. Friendly Ppl (patrons & employees). I've never had to send any food back.  ThIS time I was stuck on what to order. (When that happenS I just narrow it down and ask the waitress to pick.   The choices I narrowed down to was  THE FAMOUS \"GYRO\".  the PANCAKE COMBO.  THE CAROLINA SKILLET (see pic)  Food was great as usual,",

The food isn't the most excellent food I've ever had, but it's really good and consistently so. The price and portions can't be beat either.  We usually find ourselves in here for breakfast at least once a month.  The service is always great.  You can ask any of the servers anything and they help you with whatever you need.  That alone is worth coming back all the time.  To be fair, I've only ever ordered breakfast from this place, but that is because I love breakfast and if it's offered, I'll order it over lunch or dinner.  The service is excellent and the food consistently really good. We will keep coming as long as they keep having delicious breakfast on their menu.",

The service was excellent but compared to another similar place in the area, the food is good but not enough to get the 4th star.    On my first visit there, the server gave some recommendations and also told us what to stay away from for the lunch specials.  The lunch specials are typical meat and 2 veggie plus soup and bread.   I tried the meatloaf with mashed taters and green beans.  The soup was potato and was good but not exceptional.  The meatloaf good but it was a little salty and lacked a bit of flavor.  The mashed potatoes were a bit thick and lacked flavor.  The corn bread was moist and flavorful.  The menu is extensive and has pasta and typical diner fare.  You can also get breakfast up to 4pm.  Nice!  I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could.  3 is average and I thought the service made up for the food but it wasn't quite worth the 4-star rating.",

We sent that back and they gave him another one. Everyone was pretty much done eating by the time my wife got her food. The owner or manager came over and we suggested that I pay for my meal only as the other two had bad experience. All he said was ok with no I'm sorry for the service issues he just walked away. I will still go back but the lack of concern was bad.",

None of their soups are eatable now their salad is still fresh !But many of the dishes have been very disappointing I would give them a one-starat best!!! We tried to explain to the manager that we've been very disappointed in the food and all he had to say was well just don't come back then.

My 97 year old dad is taking daily oncology x-rays so Monday - Friday we have breakfast here.  He only wants to breakfast here as he, and I, really like it.  We have also prior to this treatment schedule had lunch here, which is also very good and a terrific deal.  The menu have just about everything.  Lots of options and portions are great:  three-egg omelets, hash browns (real ones with crispy side), endless coffee (which is not watery or weak), traditional American fare with Greek items like gyro meat and feta cheese in dishes.  And their baklava pastry is excellent and I take some home most mornings.  Service is great.  Friendly, capable wait staff who are always checking on you and will readily substitute to personal tastes.  Lunches and dinners are full meals.  You get your main course, with starch and veggie but also include soup or salad and bread.  I have to remember this when I take on a lunch because dinner later is out-of-the-question.  I have to soothe my wife with baklava...and that usually works (so far).  Prices are more than reasonable and they offer specials daily.  A special full meal lunch might come in at $6 - 7.  Hungry?  Just wanting to EAT?  Go to Park Place.  You won't regret it.",

It was obvious!  Squash, which I always loved was thickly sliced, limp, inconsistent in temp and the batter was not good at all.   Pork chops soaked through the bread. Still tasted good, but appeared to have a film over them. Also very fatty compared to what they use to be.   My husbands chicken fried steaks batter looked flat, greasy and the taste reflected that.   Manager was not concerned in the least. We even know now that he LIED to us after reading COMMENTS in Yelp. He said nothing has changed and that this are cooked like they always have been.   No plans on returning. Well wait to see what opens after this place closes once more people catch on.

I didn't expect much as it was right across from where we live, and in my experience, the places near me were always just ok (I chalk that up to not making six figures and living in the ritzy places). We have only been for breakfast, but we eat here at least once a week. The service has always been amazing. We've had a different server almost every time we've been, but they have all been super friendly and make sure we have as much coffee as we want and we never feel rushed, even when they are busy. My go-to is usually a waffle with strawberry sauce and bacon (they have the best bacon, it's crispy, but not burned...perfection). I had a Benedict on Saturday and it was also amazing. We've also never had to wait for a table although the place almost always looks full.     I hope we can go in for lunch or dinner soon and check out what else they have to offer. It's so nice having somewhere close to us to go and have coffee and plan our day, the food is great, but the service is fantastic.",

It looks like a lot of their regulars are seniors who don't have taste buds or olfactory senses anymore.   The service was subpar as well. They did apologize, but basically no one came to take our order for a very long time. Seems no one was aware we were there or in their section.   I am not sure how anyone can describe this place as \"tasty\". Very perplexing. Did we eat at the same place?",

Second time...on a week day for lunch, wait forever for my food, I order the lasagna, the waitress however did not tell me its going to take a while to prepare when I order, never came to tell us why we had to wait for so long (it was a good 30 mins I would say). And the lasagna was that good either..the sauce was very weird- with bay leaf, not much lasagna with mostly meat and sauce..I did not enjoy that.  Had a French silk to go after lunch, way too sweet for my taste.   I would go back for breakfast though, its a lot better than other breakfast restaurant in the area and price is on the low side also.",

    "text": "I used to really like coming to this restaurant.  Traditional diner type restaurant with something on the menu for everyone's tastes.  From chicken fingers, sandwiches to a meat and vegetable plate. All ages, lots of families,  as well as a mixture of the after church crowd. Casual environment.    It has changed owners recently and unfortunately not too much good has come from the change.  The wait staff doesn't last long here. Even though I knew this before coming, my mother really wanted to come here for their lasagna today.   It's a rainy day, 11:30am on a Sunday and they are semi busy at the time of our visit.  Even though they aren't at max capacity, it did take our waitress Melanie about 7-10 minutes to come over to take our drink order or acknowledge us.  We placed our drink order and even though we were ready to order our meal, she turned on her heel and started chatting it up with the table next to us.  It turns out my friend Melanie is a chatty Kathy and just likes to catch up with some tables more than others.    The owner walks around talking to customers and our waitress was flustered that the owner was speaking to the table next to me because she wanted to take their drink order.  She expressed this to me, after I got her attention to bring my mother Parmesan cheese.   Our food was super slow coming out.  For comparison's sake, there was a couple that was sat 10 seconds before my party of two and they were done with their meal before ours came out.  I had to track my friend Melanie down for some crackers, drinks weren't refilled and I ran out of coffee.  Never came back to check on us during our meal.   It wasn't a completely bad or terrible visit. The positive to it was that the Food was solid.  My eggs ordered over easy, bacon and toast were good although they were a tad on the not  warm side.  Although in my opinion,  it is hard to mess up breakfast food.    Mom reported that lasagna was delish.  Lasagna is made with ground beef and served with garlic bread.  Good deal for the price of $8.95.   Going into it - If you know there's a good chance that you're going to get mediocre service - you will be ok.   For me though, I think bad service left a bad taste in my mouth.  It will be a long while before I decide to give this place another chance.",

    "text": "Ok, first of all this would have been a 4 or 5 except for the fact that I found something in my sandwich which did not belong there - a hard red plastic tab (pic attached). It looks like the ones used to hold plastic bread bags closed. I wouldn't even be posting this expect I spoke with the manager about it, just as a courtesy, and he claimed there was nothing in their kitchen made of red plastic. I even offered to send a picture of the object which he declined.   I really was just trying to be nice and help out. I didn't ask for a replacement or anything. I am seriously disappointed and concerned at his refusal to look into the issue and his claim that the 1 inch hard plastic tab somehow materialized in my sandwich outside of his kitchen.",
