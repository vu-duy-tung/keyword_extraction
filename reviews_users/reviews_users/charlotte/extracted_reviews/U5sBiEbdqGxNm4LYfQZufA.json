    "text": "I ate at this restaurant tonight, and as an avid foodie I was extremely disappointed. When my food came, it was cold. Not even warm, but actually cold. Now I ordered the top sirloin and mashed potatoes, and realized it was cold after the first bite. A waitress came over and took my plate back to the kitchen. The manger came back out,with my plate 5 minutes later. First thing... It was the same food! I have NEVER been to a restaurant in my life and had a problem with the food and they brought the same food out to me! I own my own catering company, and that is an absolute no-no! If someones food goes out wrong , you make another one. Additionally , my steak was supposed to be cooked to medium, which it was, so if the chef tried to warm it up, it would have gone over. I must admit though that it was not over... because it was still COLD! So it goes back again and come out about 10 min later and the new steak is swimming in a pool of blood b/c it didn't rest. I don't know what kind of training your manager has, but that us not how that situation should have been handled. This experience completely turned me off. I won't be eating here again. Hopefully your Southpark location doesn't handle things like this.",

I don't understand why, when you see the crumpled, bruised, soggy smelly chunks of potatoes fall out of the bag, that you continue to cook them and serve them. The chicken from the caesar wrap was dry and tasted of freezer burn. the waitress can't hear or maybe comprehend that no lemon means no lemon. don't bring a tea and just plop a nasty piece of lemon in the glass 2 minutes after I said NO LEMON. overall this place is terrible and you'd get better quality by going into the mall and eating that processed crap.",

One of my table mates had the steak and fries. Now, for $18, I'm not expecting a buttery filet. But, this was tough to the point of being inedible. I had the summer salmon salad. The salmon was ordered medium rare, but came well done. It was also a tiny piece of fish - had the rest of the salad been adequate, I wouldn't have minded. However, the \"salad\" consisted of a handful of baby greens, no dressing, and a couple of feta cubes/olives, and two cherry tomatoes. Disappointing.",

    "text": "We have been going to this location of Harper's for a long time. Over the years, we have seen a slow decline in the quality of the food and service and a steady increase in prices.   Our most recent visit was last week. The pulled pork was dry and chewy. The cole slaw had little to no dressing and was basically a pile of cabbage (their cole slaw dressing is fantastic if you can get a good order). They gave me the wrong side order. They also gave my wife the wrong side order. It was one of those meals where you leave feeling cheated. I left half of my food uneaten.  It seems like there is a regular problem with getting things right because there have been a number of times when the orders have been wrong. Also, we used to love their pizza, but it has gone downhill also. The last time I tried the pizza, it was burnt. The time before, it was doughy and undercooked. Other times, it was rubbery from sitting under the heat lamp for too long.   Also - pet peeve alert - if you serve fries, don't make the customer ask you for ketchup. Just bring it out with the meal. It will save your runner/server a trip and make the customer happier.  We used to be big fans of Harper's, but now I don't think I would recommend them anymore.",

Table service is generally okay, with mostly young people who are fine, but do not really know the menu deeply, nor are able to make good recommendations.

I'm pretty sure the waiter thought I was going to be high maintenance because as soon as he brought my Diet Coke in a short tumbler I stopped him before he left and said, \"Just so you know, I drink like a fish. Do you have any larger glasses to save you some trips?\" He said they didn't, but that he'd bring me two smaller glasses at a time. He kept up with me and the litter of tumblers that accrued over the course of our meal. I can't imagine though, why they insist on serving sodas in tiny little tumbler glasses.  The food was good. I ordered the chopped chef salad with chicken. The menu said it came with avocado, but it did not. Still, it was quite tasty.  The bill for 1 beer, my soda, 1 app and 2 dinner salads came out to roughly $45. Decent, although a little pricey for lunch. Good restaurant, we'll visit again I'm sure.",

We got our waters and placed our order--dad and I were going to split the BBQ Chicken Pizza and Chicken Caesar Pizza, chicken fingers for the sister, and salmon for mom.   Our food came out, and the BBQ Chicken pizza was pretty good! Although I'm not a huge onion fan, they weren't horrible. The Chicken Caesar pizza though? Dee-licious! Probably one of the best pizzas I've had. As I was enjoying it, I was rudely interrupted by the hostess dragging a chair across the floor. Nice touch. The lettuce on the pizza was fresh, and the garlic sauce was a winner. The cheese was more of a salad-cheese than a pizza-cheese, which I liked! Everybody else reported their food was good as well.  Service was very good, I thought our waiter was a very genuine gentleman, and had a smile on his face the whole time. Thumbs up. Overall, Harper's exceeded my expectations, and I would return next time I'm near the mall.",

The coffee was fresh and was good. My chicken and waffles were really good. The waffle was crisp and light, served with 100% pure maple syrup. The chicken was excellent, the breading was herbed and very light, almost a tempura like consistency. My boyfriend's potatoes were really good.

Room was nice and look like the staff are doing good till the food came. The set menu has a sirloin steak with roasted potatoes and veggies and side salad. The first course salad come out a small salad may be 4 or 5 bites. Then the steak was about 6 ounces , the potatoes were raw and soggy veggies and no gorgonzola butter sauce like it said on the menu . So I asked for the fries in place if under cooked potatoes and asked for the sauce so there is some flavor. The server comes back and said well there is no sauce on the steak and I said I know but it should be like it said in the menu , so she comes back with a scoop of butter and hand it to me like I was supposed to melt it some how on my cold and overcooked steak , and left . By the way it was $25 per person. It was a birthday party did not want to  complain there so here it is. At least hope the chief at Harper's can see this and be shame of what he or she put out that day . Other people have the same issue too. Don't think I will go back again",

Also, when she's busy she always comes back and apologizes.  So for Carrie alone, I'd give her 5 stars.  She always gets a great tip from me.  As far as the food, Harpers food is good.  The only thing I don't like is it's really not that healthy.  Even the chicken on salads is fried.  Sure there are some healthy items but on Harper's menu these are rarer than other restaurants.  I can't say I have a favorite here yet.  The 6 cheese pasta is pretty tasty but so are their tacos.  The barbecue is hit or miss.  All I will say is whatever you order, you do get a lot of food!",

    "text": "I love this Harpers.  The location is convenient and I was already in the area dropping off my ring, so I met a friend for a day beer and lunch.  It was snowing outside and this location is just a comfortable vibe.  The bar is a nice size and has many cocktail tables for easy seating.  The dining room is decent sized and has a number of large circular booths, which are really nice.  For lunch I had the steak salad.  It was a bit pricier for a lunch salad, but I figured I would give it a shot.  It was a little bland for my liking and didn't have enough toppings to justify 15 dollars.  The lettuce was almost grated, which made it really easy for eating, but the lettuce to steak/mushroom ratio was way out of proportion.  My friend had the hummus and a side of the garlic parm fries, which were amazing.    Next time, I want to try that BBQ Chicken pizza everyone has mentioned!  Overall a good little spot for a cozy comfy dinner/lunch.  The service was great.  Next time your in ask for Laura!  She is an amazing server who goes above and beyond for a great guest experience.  Overall a nice little spot to dine anytime of day with great service.",

    "text": "I don't usually give five star reviews, but this place really went out of their way to treat us well at lunch.  I wasn't expecting much from a place connected to a mall, but the menu was diverse and the beer selections were excellent.  We started with the cajun calamari which was good and then the large and fresh entree salads were brought out.  I ordered a pizza which was brought out by the manager who said it was too burnt for their standards, so we could have it if we wanted it and they were remaking the pizza.  How often does a restaurant have enough integrity to fix a mistake before the customer even asks?  They brought the second pizza later and it was top notch.  Sam Adams Cherry Wheat on draft, a good pizza, and superior service.  A winning combination!",

    "text": "I have had the occasion to eat at Harper's Southpark several times in my life. It was good but not over the top, gotta get me to my YELP account good. Yesterday we had lunch at the Carolina Place Mall location and it was a Get to My Yelp Account visit.   To start, you gotta love the smokey smell as you walk in. It sets the mood for a comfy well cooked meal. This can backfire for a biz if the food doesn't live up to the ambiance set up by the smell. NO probs there!  We were seated immediately as it was just at the beginning of lunch and lots of folks were still in church. Our waitress (I wish I had thought to get her name) was there quickly and was super friendly and helpful.   I got the Streetside taco's, 2 brisket and one chicken. (Not a fan of fish taco's but they also were available) They came on 6 inch flour tortilla's and were packed! I seriously enjoyed the chicken one and the brisket one's were close behind. Even my not being a slaw guy, they had the slaw, brisket and cheese and the contrast in flavors and textures made me giggly! I, as always, ordered jlapeno's and hot sauce, to compliment them and it was delightful. I got a loaded baked tater for a side and was PACKED full by the end of the meal.   My wife decided on the 6 cheese penne pasta. I scouted the room while we were looking at the menu's and it looked delish. To the point, it was! I could only see the slight lack of salt as a minor prob, but that is easily remedied. I got several forkfuls because, like the taco's it was a serious portion of food.  My little girl got the chicken fingers and had to fight off the roaming fingers of her old man who ws trying his best to get a second bite. Light and crispy so you could really taste the chicken but enjoy the flavor of the herby coating. We were shocked when our waitress told us that a lot of families send them back because their kids are happier with a McD's style nugget! WRONG!! BAD PARENTS!!!! My son was so taken with them , he ordered a kids size chicken fingers to go along with his adult sized buttered penne pasta (which BTW, had some serious fresh ground and flaked parm cheese on it, I thought his head would burst!)  I do have one con to report but it is not a deal breaker for me, just a pet peeve I have about food delivery. Harper's (at least this location) is not a tray place.  That is to say that the food (ours and every table's food) was delivered by hand by the servers and runners. This can be a nice touch but as a restaurant gets busier during shift, the availability of help gets thinner. We got to see servers carrying several plates at a time and having to base the plate closest to their body against their body. Several of the lady servers had the plates jacked up under their boob for stability. Now I am all for boob food, but maybe in a more  intimate setting! I find nothing wrong with a server bringing a tray to the table for service. I did notice that drinks could be trayed but during our meal, no food on trays. Just a note, really and I wanted to say boob-food!  We will go back when we are in the area.",

    "text": "3.5 only because I need more variety on the menu with me being a Pescatarian (Seafood/ Water Animals only for meat). My family and I have been to Harpers a total of 4 times now, it's NOT the restaurant we say \"Okay let's go out to eat, where should we go, I know HARPERS\" . Harpers is that place we end up at if the Mr. and I are dragged to Carolina Place mall by our little one. She MUST go to that mall because it's the only one we have found in Charlotte that has a Forever 21.  One item that you can't go wrong with is the Baja Fish Tacos on Corn tortilla, the salsa is sooooo GOOD. We end up dipping our fries in the salsa if we are eating fries due to the taste. My daughter ALWAYS get the chicken tenders and my husband ALWAYS take one, the chicken tenders put you in the mindset of Houston's restaurant chicken tenders. I believe Harpers may be owned by the same restaurant group as my daughter and husband are chicken tender connoisseurs and they feel that they are TOO SIMILAR so they must have the same recipe (owner). This more recent trip they had a Fish sandwich special of the day \"Blacken Salmon BLT\" not sure why EVERY restaurant in Charlotte like to wrap pork around everything or add it to everything but that's the case and I'm over my soap box. I ordered the Blacken Salmon BLT MINUS the BACON, it was pretty awesome tasting. I have no complaints. It came out on a whole grain toasted bun and the tartar sauce was extremely fresh and tasty. I had a backed sweet potato on the side MINUS the brown sugar and cinnamon, it was cooked to perfection and I enjoyed it to the fullest. If in Carolina Place Mall and you don't want to eat Food Court Food, check out Harpers especially if you eat all types of meat (you will have a variety of options).",

I ordered a beer while we looked over the menu... if we weren't starving and didn't have two small children with us we probably would have left. The menu was very small and all over the place. I decided to go with a daily special, BBQ salmon with mixed veggies. My husband ordered the wood fired pizza. The waitress told me my salmon came with another side so I chose a side salad which was a 3$ up charge. The salad was good, that was probably the best part of the meal. I asked for my salmon medium well and it was medium and mushy. Also, there were no mixed veggies on my plate. My dinner came and it was literally a slab of salmon all by its lonesome. My husband said the pizza was just ok, the pepperoni was still cold and didn't look like it had been on a wood fired stove. We left still hungry and spent over $60. My meal ended up being close to 17$ for a small salad and small piece of salmon. Way too overpriced. We won't be back.",

It was limp at the tips, charred at the stems,  and left dark gray, greasy residue on the plate. Beth , our server, asked whether I would like a replacement, and she did offer other sides, but I really hoped that this was just a fluke on the first serving of asparagus, so I asked for a second order of asparagus. Second serving was as bad. Worst side I've ever been presented with at a restaurant - TWICE! INEDIBLE! Salmon was alright, I think, but I had that gassy, greasy residue on my tongue from tasting that awful asparagus that interfered with the rest of the meal. For dessert, I had mousse, but it was more like ice cream. Husband had key lime pie that he said was \"good.\" Definitely not the meal I anticipated, and if not for Beth trying to make things better, I would have dropped the rating even more.",

Ordering the BBQ combo with ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork, which is served with fries ($19), I was hoping for the smoky deliciousness that I could smell after exiting Barnes and Noble next door (which convinced me to stop at Harper's instead of going to Peckers for wings).  The meal arrived and holy moly - that is a lot of meat (that's what she said).  I was pretty darn excited until I started actually eating.  The ribs were dry - and I don't mean dry rub with no sauce, I mean dry as in no moisture.  The pulled pork was also dry and the tiny cup of BBQ sauce that was provided wasn't going to help that out.  The beef brisket was moist, but a little too fatty - the brisket was my favorite of the mediocre trio.  Fries were fries, a little limp but I may have only had 10, not a big fan of fries.  Cole slaw tasted fresh and crunchy, quite good.    Total tab was a little over $20 before tip.  I don't feel I got a $20 value from my meal, for 1/2 of that I could have gotten 10 delicious wings from Peckers and for a few dollars more I could have gotten a juicy prime rib from Firebirds.  Overall, I have always enjoyed my meals from Harper's, but I will stick to burgers and that type of food if I return, their BBQ combo leaves a lot to be desired.",

They were out of all potato product other than French Fries. My dish included a Baked Potato -- nope French Fries.  Nancy's dish was to come with Asparagus first time so tough my steak knife couldn't cut it..... they brought more. Again too tough that we couldn't cut it. So she asked for mashed potato's. NOPE OUT.  So they brought coleslaw (now mind you my wife likes coleslaw)....this was so thick with mayonnaise that even she (who loves Mayo) couldn't eat it.  Then we were presented with a full bill with an $3 up charge for my steak...... WHAT? Queen's feast is your best foot forward. The steak was good .....but not that good. Nancy had the Salmon good but again neither of us got the side we were supposed to. Only after we complained did they offer a discount. Manager only approached when the first side was bad. JUST WOW. We will not be back.",

On a Saturday night the place had a wait.   We were immediately seated and I noticed they had $3 Blue Moon on tap. Any special on Saturday is noted for me. I ordered the salmon and substituted mixed veggies for the asparagus only side it comes with. When we got our food the salmon was delicious. Very good, but it didn't have a sauce that came with it, and when I asked they didn't have aoli. The veggies were peppers and onion and some other types that were grilled. I like my veggies more well done, and these were still very crisp. If I were to order them again, I think I would ask for them to be very well cooked.   Overall, I would come back again. For a date night because it is a little expensive.",

I was tired of eating chicken for the last several days and spotted a prime rib on the menu. I ordered the prime rid medium rare and other members of our party placed their order. The wait begins:  The only item that was ordered that required cooking were the waffles, other items were prepared in advance. Forty minutes later our food finally arrived, not all at the same time, but one at the time. When my order arrived it was cooked to the level of shoe leather. Being hungry and was afraid that I would not get any food before it was time to I ate it. Bottom line:  Harper's is not the restaurant to go to to enjoy good food, next time I will go to another restaurant.",

We come here regularly with son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren because it is clean, everyone can get something they would like to eat and there is a good bar. The servers are excellent.  They are prompt, friendly and will make substitutions.  And even more important, they will bring the meals ordered by the children first, rather than bunching them with the adult orders.  Helps to keep the hungry children occupied and happy.  Truly a family place and 97 year old dad can order a side or a child's portion of macaroni & cheese which is more than enough to satisfy him.  A side order is a small cup, child's order is a nice bowl.  And the mac cheese is good.",

We had a hard time deciding what to get because the menu is rather limited.   We started out with the crab and artichoke dip. It was an alright dip but it came with things to dip in that were kind of weird. We couldn't decide if they were supposed to be pita or chips. They had a weird floppy tasteless consistency. My friends got the tacos and I got the fajitas. The fajitas were kind of disappointing. They were on par with what you get a Chili's. The tacos were the same. Essentially this is a dressed up Chili's, but with a little higher price points.It appears that they change their menu seasonally. They should expand their options and improve their recipes instead of changing.  Service was excellent. Environment- very dark and dim.",

The staff just seemed bored and disinterested in everything.   The waitress seemed to be in a hurry to get us in and out. Being our first time here we had some questions and she obviously wasn't in the mood to explain anything.   Started off with the crab and artichoke dip. The dip itself was tolerable, but the \"chips\" were incredibley inconsistent. Some were crispy and others felt like they never made it in to the fryer. They were soft and room temperature with, what appeared to be olive oil, dumped on them and entirely too much dill seasoning.   They were out of the house steak so I got the brisket. It was cooked well but had no flavor at all.   Wife got the pastrami sandwich which was pretty good. Probably the only positive of our visit.   I sincerely doubt I'd visit again and certainly would caution people against going here. My guess is that the place is poorly managed and the staff is burned out from dealing with the mall crowd.",

The food was okay, pricey for what you actually get. My toddler daughter wanted the cheese pizza which was an item on the kids menu and it was below average she did not like it at all it was very hard and not easy to eat. I ordered a strawberry margarita and the glass was the smallest glass I have ever seen for a margarita, I wasn't to pleased with that. The waitress was great and patient. I would say just try it out for yourself, everyone's opinion is different.",

Wife had a salad and the chicken was overdone, black and dry. Food overall seems of low quality or processed. Surroundings and ambiance is very nice. Service was overall good.",

I was pleasantly surprised.   - - - Here's what I would want to know:  The Brussels sprouts sides is tasty...if you don't like Brussels sprouts.   The chicken sandwich with horseradish is delicious. The tomato and pickle were fresh and full of flavor.   The Cuban has pulled pork instead of sliced pork...and it looked delightful.   The burger is cooked to order, and while nothing special, it's a solid burger.   The service was amazing and the ambiance is great. It's a darker (and cooler temperature-wise) vibe.   I would return and try out their Cuban or their arugula salad.   Maybe both.   This seems like a safe place with the kids (I saw several pizzas come out and the kids who were working on them seemed jazzed).   Safe place for a post (or pre) mall meal.",

    "text": "Harper's has changed their menu since my last visit and I'm not sure its for the best.   We visited on a Friday afternoon and was surprised that it was almost empty.    We started the visit by ordering the dipping duo (creamy spinach and pimento cheese).  Keep in mind that Ive been ordering this appetizer for over 15 years.  When it came out, I was completely let down, as they'd completely changed the recipe.  The spinach tasted like steamed spinach and you couldn't even taste the chopped onions.  When I moved the dip around, half of the bowl had warm water on the bottom.  The pimento cheese now has jalapenos in it and it super spicy (it used to be a True southern pimento dip with a hint of pepper). Our waitress was kind and allowed us to switch out the spinach for the guacamole.  In my opinion, this dipping option is not worth the price ($11) because the taste isn't there anymore.   I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad (not on the menu) with Caesar dressing on the side.  The breast chicken used to be blackened but this one looked like it was shredded chicken instead and was dry.   For dessert, we ordered the brownie with ice cream.  The dish looked beautiful when it came out but upon further Inspection, was truly a let down.  It looked and tasted like a little Debbie's brownie that'd been warmed up.    I will say that the service was very good and at the end of the day, it wasn't our waitress' fault for how the food tasted.    Im very disappointed as Harper's has been one of my favorite restaurants for well over TEN YEARS.  I have never minded their prices until yesterday.  I walked away paying $50 for a lunch and was overly disappointed because I felt that I could've gone anywhere else and have been more satisfied.",

The herb vinaigrette dressing was really good, and I don't even like dressing very much.  The salad was also very tasty, especially the grilled chicken.  Many moons ago, they always included a piece of cheese toast with salads.  Apparently, that is no longer the case, which is very sad!  They probably should offer crackers or some kind of break with their salads.   Otherwise, everything was perfect.  As I was nearing the bottom of my iced tea, the server continually brought a new glass. Why doesn't that happen in all restaurants?  If was vigilant on the server's part.  Harper's may be a chain, but they are a chain that doesn't seem like a chain and they do things right. The food is consistently good, as is the service. Two thumbs up. I often forget about this restaurant, because I avoid malls like the plague.  I need to remember this restaurant more often:  NOTE TO SELF.  Since they have their own entrance, you will never have to step foot in the mall, which is a huge PLUS for me!",

Hummus and Ahi Poke are both great. Their version of Spinach Dip is good. I like the cracker type pizza skins they serve for dipping. Starter salads are large - perfect for sharing. On both occasions I had the Grilled Salmon. They prepare it to your temperature and don't miss on the mid-rare. I also had Brussels Sprouts which are probably the best I've had ever. At one location the plate also came with mashed potatoes. We did the Chocolate Chip Cookie dessert. YUM! The menus are slightly different from the Mall to the South Park location. South Park seems to have more high-end entrees. Plenty of selections and a nice array of choices at both.",

We ordered a pepperoni pizza, the 6-cheese pasta, and some wings, which were covered in a sauce that was not described on the menu.  Dinner and service were fine nothing spectacular but not bad either. We were having a great conversation so we ordered dessert-the chocolate chip cookie skillet with ice cream. This was very good! However, around midnight we both were feeling sick. I am a lady so I will spare you the details. Let's just say our bodies did not like the food and was getting it out!  That night I was so glad we don't live together- but that's another subject.   The following morning, I called the restaurant to inform them what happened and spoke to Steve. He wanted to know exactly what we shared & even implied our sickness would be a a quick reaction to food poisoning. He said he would talk to the chef and call me back. I have not heard from him. Perhaps he should know <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFDA.gov&s=85788de75f6c3cf1349351ae3044f879d707adc96b1a837686aa6d73586ac694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FDA.gov</a>, staphylococcus aureus can cause illness 1-6 hours after ingestion.

It was made in-house (none of that previously frozen brand named stuff).  Great flavor!  I don't know what was in it but it was good!  I did see some black beans in the mix.  Anyway, it was huge and hand shaped like a beef burger, grilled and placed on a bun topped with sauteed mushrooms (yum!) and melted aged cheese.  It was delish!!!!!",

I like the BBQ grilled chicken sandwich with roasted vegetables. The roasted veggies aren't listed on the menu but you can just ask for them. They are the best I've ever had! I am going to work on making veggies like that for myself. So, if you go make sure to order the roasted veggies...you won't be disappointed!",

This past time last week, I went here for drinks and apps with some work colleagues and sat in the bar at the high-top tables. Got there right at 6pm and asked about the happy hour specials that I had in the past. The first waiter mentioned they don't do happy specials anywhere in North Carolina? Tried to explain that I had them before and he didn't think I was correct. I understand if the specials are not in effect when I'm there, but don't try to correct me for what I know I had a few weeks prior. Anyway, moved on to order with a different server and ordered many apps. They were pretty good - had the crab dip, chips and 3 dips and calamari. All were ok, though the calamari was nice. Will go there again before 6pm or after 9pm for the \"bar specials\".",

It can be really nice to stop in here for dinner after spending a Saturday at the mall.  It smells great and the brick-and-wood decor gives it a very anti-mall feel.  As Jeff said, the food isn't healthy by any stretch of the imagination, but it's pretty dang delicious.  I am quite the fan of the classic Angus burger.  You can taste the char on the patty, but it doesn't taste burned.  This is how Adam likes his burgers, folks.  However... I don't know if it's the volume of diners or merely the restaurant's employee culture, but the service is pretty unremarkable.  Your waiter will be polite; he will take your order promptly; he will bring you your food; then, he will disappear until it's time for the check.  This can be annoying when you're eating fries and need hydration.  He also might neglect to ask how you want your burger cooked, so make sure to tell him, or you'll get well-done.",

Omelette, hash browns and french toast were all tasty.  The bacon \"side\" was two small, thin strips and the fresh fruit was ordinary.  I'd give the food three stars but with prices at about $9 each for the breakfast entrees, I'm knocking a star off for value.  We choose Harper's because we could make a reservation and my friend needed to catch a plane so we couldn't wait for a table at any other place.  But unless I'm in a similar time crunch, I'm unlikely to choose Harper's again for a Sunday brunch.  I have enjoyed lunch at Harper's previously and would do that again without hesitation.",

All of the food was above par, the service was incredibly nice and accommodating and the ambiance was low-key but classy.  She loved it completely, and if you can get a pre-teen jazzed about a restaurant then you're doing pretty good.  I find myself usually gravitating toward their specials.  Yesterday's special was a local tomato stacked with avocado and crab meat.  YUM!  I will give you one warning though:  BEWARE THE COOKIES!  Harper's chocolate chunk cookies are a pure slice of heaven.  We bought a dozen for 15 bucks, which sounds pricey unless you consider the cookies are double the size in width of those two-dollar cookies you get in the mall and when they come out they are ooey and gooey and sooo warm and yummy!  The only problem with them is they are the child equivalent of fifty cups of coffee followed by a shot of pure adrenaline.  My smaller kids SHARED a cookie and bounced off the walls for the rest of the night!  Very worth the money, but WHOO BOY, the kids get hopped up on those things!  It won't stop me from getting them again though!",

I have noticed a few reviews state the menu is limited, we don't find that to be the case. We've been with both adults as well as toddlers we've yet to have issues pleasing anyone in our group!!! The crab-artichoke dip appetizer with freshly made chips is wonderful!!! I think we've tried just about everything on the menu with no disappointments!! Hands down our all time fav/go to choice is \"six cheese penne pasta\", it's certainly not for the fat gram counters. I am not a fan at all of any type of \"white cream sauce with pasta\" meals, EVER!!!! So not the case with this, it is also more than a tad \"heavy on the bacon and sausage\", no worries as the six cheese penne pasta is even better without those! Just be sure to request they be left off. Serving sizes are more than huge both my husband and I have a second full meal the next day and then some. My only suggestion would be a smaller side salad, they do offer a lettuce wedge salad type that again is on the very large size. I suppose one could share the lettuce wedge, I'd still like to see a small tossed salad offer. All very \"first world\" type \"problems\" I'd say!! One can't do wrong with anything menu offering.",

This restaurant has a nice variety to choose from without being overwhelming. Typically has a number of daily specials that are tempting. I've never had a disappointing meal, and most of the time the service is quite attentive even when very busy. I like the coffee Harper's serves.  A group of friends (couples) drop by here every few months to catch up and enjoy a meal together. We can comfortably have any mix of pizza, burgers, bbq, a steak, or a special... linger over the meal visiting and NEVER get the impression that the staff is trying to rush us on out. There is also an accommodating attitude to couples sharing a dessert. The wait satff remains attentive to refill needs, etc., even after the bill has been paid. Rarely ever have we had a server having an \"off\" night. Sometimes we have to \"force\" ourselves to go elsewhere when we meet just to keep from ONLY going here for these \"catch ups\" when we meet.  I do not know how long its been on the menu, but visitng there this week we had the Tuxedo Cake... not like one I'd had elsewhere... THIS ONE IS CHEESECAKE! This cake is AMAZING... WOW! Texture is much like a NY Style cheesecake with a crushed chocolate wafer crust, chocolate, and white layer! SO creamy good!   Visited February 2013",

    "text": "I remember when this place was new, and was actually a kind of decent restaurant...now, it seems to be kind of decent at best.   I was first to arrive in my party of five, and requested a comfortable, large booth for myself and four older adults. After being briefed on the fact that my future table was   Being occupied by an employee and her food, but that it would SURELY be cleaned right away, I was ushered to an incredibly small tight horseshoe booth by the bar. Not really my definition of a comfortable seating situation for five...  Service was not The best, but we were there in the awkward time between 3-4. Regardless, I would expect to not be rushed to make decisions on my lunch during downtime. One of my elderly company requested a dinner menu to compare (as we were informed dinner was served all day), and it was easy to tell why....they were practically the same menu! Maybe take one salad away, add two entrees for dinner...  Started off with three dip app, the pimento cheese and salsa were spot on...artichoke dip was lukewarm and not as tasty. As my lunch I ordered the ahi salad, under the assumption (and confirmation by the server) that this would indeed be a salad. It came out on a rectangular plate- small, maybe 1\"x1\" chunks of \"sashimi\" grade seared tuna, a small side bowl of greens, and a random bowl of noodles with an attempted peanut sauce. I was a little confused as to how this could be perceived as a True salad. It was an incredibly Americanized bland representation of a tuna titake at best, with a random bowl of bland noodles. I asked for extra dressing to dip my tuna in, and I NEVER do that. To a piece of deliciously fresh fish, that would be sacrilege. My saving grace was the side of pimento Mac and cheese...which I devoured. My cohorts had burgers that looked awesome, doused with pimento cheese and onions. Clearly this was the way to have gone.   Point and case. I was going on a limb by ordering asian fusion from Harpers, but Do not order the ahi salad if you too appreciate the value and taste  of sashimi grade fish. You will be disappointed at the cost of $17. I'd reccommend going for the cheaper and much more appetizing looking burger, and a more comfortable table.",

    "text": "Have dined at Harpers many times at both the Woodlawn Rd location and also the SouthPark location.  I haven't been in a few years and was down near Carolina Place Mall and looking for a good, casual meal.  I saw the Harpers and based on good memories from visits to previous locations decided to dine there.    Walking in the traditional wood fired grill gave me pleasant reminders as the scent of hickory filled the air.  We sat down in a comfortable booth and began looking over the menu.  I was open to new items as I was sure things had changed but have to say I was a bit disappointed to see that Harpers seems to be letting others lead.  Most of their menu items looked like things other restaurants have innovated.  There were a couple of promising looking items (but they did not include the $17 farm raised salmon).  I decided to go with the crispy chicken sandwich.  Harpers used to have an amazing chicken sandwich with a simple but good bun and a tasty dijon mustard sauce.  My companion went with the artisan pizza (flatbread) with bacon cheeseburger.  He loved it and he also loved the tomato bisque.  My chicken sandwich was nothing special.  It was OK but it was dripping wet and the chicken was kinda room temperature.  Slaw on a sandwich is OK but it shouldn't be sopping wet.  And side from the hint of jalapeno, there just wasn't any flavor.  Texture was pretty bland as well.  The slaw was wet but not crisp.  The bread was OK but not remarkable.  The chicken was competently cooked but not hot.    The fries came in hot but were a mix of crispy and soggy.  Some seemed like they had been overcooked but were crispy.  Others were soft and saturated with oil as if they had been dumped in when the oil was well below temperature.    We had discussed getting dessert there versus going someplace and getting a whole cheesecake, pie, etc and simply taking it home.  However, I remembered the deep dish apple cobbler so we decided to share one.  It took a very long time to get the cobbler and I though that perhaps it had been freshly made and they were simply waiting on it to be thoroughly cooked.  One bite told me that the cobbler (which was still pretty flavorful) was at least a day old and had simply been re-heated.  The breading was soft and saturated with no hint of crispness or crunch.  There was plenty of cinnamon and sugar.  I also ran across a couple of apple slices.  However, this seemed a bit short of my memories of hot and fresh cobbler I had had numerous times before.  On the whole it was a poor substitute for something that used to be a signature dessert.    Given a $38 bill with tip for myself and my son I won't be hurrying back.  I'm sure a couple of soft drinks would have pushed us into the $42 range and that's simply to much for an \"OK\" lunch for two.",
