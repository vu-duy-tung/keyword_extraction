I am not kidding it is the best burger I have ever eaten, so juicy and succulent with delicious toppings. Their burgers are so good I have yet to try any other entree when I go because I am craving the burger. The Bacon wrapped tater tots with the maple glaze are ridic amazing, and the pan fried corn nuggets with goat cheese ranch are equally as incredible. It is a little more expensive, but not outrageous. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.",

We had a server in training who quite honestly shouldn't get the job-but Fran took care of us. She stopped to chat a few times while we were waiting on food and then after it had came. I got the sloppy burger with a side of their homemade fries and goatcheese ranch. SUPERB and hit the spot. Those pretzel rolls? THE BOMB! My friend ordered a French burger that came with tomatoes and melted brie... it was out of this world!  I have heard nothing but good things about Fran's-and I have nothing but good things to say. I cannot WAIT to try there again-and will hopefully have a better experience with a now trained server :)  She has specials, and of course-the burgers. I was floored. I could only eat half of mine but every bite was divine, cheesy and meaty goodness. Ahhhhhh. Oh-and the tea was so deliciously strong, perfect on a warm and sunny afternoon!",

By the time we were FINALLY able to leave, many of the tables were filled and EVERYONE was waiting for either food, more drinks or their check.  The food was so-so. Certainly not worth a special trip.  The beer menu is minimal and the drafts are overpriced.  We never did get the drinks we ordered.  Took us two hours to wait for our food, then wait for our check, then wait for the server to run our cards.  There are many other local restaurants with quality food and much better service - I would not recommend Fran's to any of my friends.",

When i got my first paycheck (the day i quit, and a month after starting) i realized i was being paid less than was agreed upon, and her account was at \"high risk\" of being used fraudulently.  I quit that day because i am concerned as to her ability to be a dependable source of income.    Furthermore, i would not eat at this restaurant.  The kitchen area is repugnant.  Unless i was working, anything sliced on the deli slicer or french fry press was probably despicable, and the dishes are likely not much better.  Most temperature sensitive items (especially salad dressings) are kept out at all times during service, making them very hazardous, and Fran herself abhors having to turn around and get them out of the cooler (we also reused them way longer than we are supposed to, ie. a Russian dressing bottle was held for the entire month i worked there, and not replaced once). Worst of all, when those tater tots you all love so much, begin to mold over in the bag, she just tells you to pick out any moldy ones and get rid of them and use any that didn't look too bad...   Fran is a heartless woman, who cares as little about you the customer as she does about the people working for her.  She's in the business of making money, and doesnt care who she puts in harms way to make it.",

Lots of healthy options,too, if grease isn't your thing.  I'm a fan of the Latin Wedge salad, but, like a previous reviewer pointed out, adding chicken or other protein to your salad significantly bumps up the cost....pushing it past a typical lunch price point for me.  The Lemon Chicken Salad sandwich is great - a perfect sandwich for the summer.  I almost feel like they're trying too hard with the menu, though.  Presentation/execution both struggle a little.  Service is always friendly, but the staff frequently seems a little overworked.  Not atypical from other small restaurants, I guess.  Not much consistency in server speed either.  Overall, a good, but not necessarily great lunch joint.",

Casual Atmosphere with unique decor (i wasnt crazy about the walk-in fridge in the middle of the secondary dining area) kinda strange! Cool kitschy-cowgirl decor. FOOD was amazing!  You must try the tater tot appetizer.  Nothing like the Ore-Ida tots!  These were morsels of sweet potato, wrapped in bacon and then glazed with a jalapeno sweet glaze!  Holy *%#@!   Mussels with a coconut curry sauce were also good ... but nothing to brag about. The daily special was \"shrimp & grits\". So we gave it a try. Highly recommended! Perfectly cooked shrimp with gouda cheese grits.   Then we finished it with their bread pudding... It was huge and delish!",

After ordering food and getting our drinks we never saw our waiter again except for a \"drive-by\" (\"Everything OK here?\" As he ran by without waiting for an answer.) After an hour with no food and no drinks past the first round I got up and went to the bar to pay for the drinks and left. While we were there we saw several waiter-less tables, including one with a dude who went to the bar to get a beer for himself since no one came his table to ask if he needed another drink.  Based on other reviews, it appears Fran's never got their act together. There are WAY too many restaurants in Charlotte (and Dilworth) to put up with this. Terrible start to the weekend.  To paraphrase Keyshawn, \"COME ON, FRAN!\"  Won't be back.",

FRAN abruptly approached and with a smirking look and bad attitude corrected us that this was not the way her burgers were prepared.

Condescendingly, She attempted to put my husband \"in his place\" and educate him on why this \"over the top\" lettuce request was not going to happen.  YES, she had the lettuce but NO, it did not belong on THAT BURGER!   This restaurant would be much better off from a customer service perspective if it were called FRANK'S FILLING STATION.

And she sat us in front of the plate glass window up front. I repeated my request and she walked away.  It looks like a fun place for regulars, but we just sat there feeling left out of the party. Hospitality was really lacking, server did his best, but seemed overwhelmed with three tables. Someone who I assumed was Fran came by (didn't introduce herself) and asked how things were. We mentioned that things were a little slow and we had a problem with one of the apps ... She just smiled and nodded and walked off. I don't think she heard a word I said. Kind of distracted. We got a glass of wine, and wanted a second, but it never arrived. We were charged for it anyway. Would have complained, but by the time the check came, we just couldn't wait to leave.  We tried several different apps, none of which arrived hot. The bacon tots were flavorless ... A real shame, because the premise was so promising. We shared the crab cakes for entree, very small, soggy and buried under carrot shavings.  The TV over the bar was tuned to the food network. What was playing there looked much more appetizing than anything that came to our table.  Perhaps things are different for lunch, or for the regulars. I'm sad to report we won't find out.",

Lounging around the apartment after a wine tasting with Adam R. and waiting for Peter E. to get home got us really hungry and Fran's food really hit the spot.  The space is cozy and warm, though if you get seated in front of the door during the colder months be prepared for periodic blasts of cold from people walking in! I decided to put my diet restrictions aside for this visit to taste those crispy delicious bacon wrapped tater tots! I'm a fan of the jalapeno glaze on the sweet potato tots definitely, not too hot and seasoned quite nicely. The bacon overwhelms the taste of both the sweet potato and regular a bit though. Maybe make a regular version of the appetizer?  After this came the glorious entrees. I got the eggplant parm and that thing is ginormous! I was content and full by halfway through. The sauces and cheesiness were bold and flavorful with lots of thick slices of eggplant throughout the bowl. Yummy! I find it curious though that the dish comes with 2 slices of the olive oil grilled bread, but if you order an extra basket it doesn't come with any.  The service is where it sadly falls a bit short. I was really lacking a water refill towards the end of my meal, especially since I chose such a salty app and entree. Also I'm not sure if our waiter heard me but I wanted the olive oil grilled bread I ordered to come out at the beginning of the meal but hey whatever it made a nice accompaniment to my entree. He was kind of awkward and standoffish but thankfully left us mostly alone.  It's just these little inconsistencies that keep me from giving Fran a 5 star review sadly along with their serious lack of vegetarian friendly options. For delicious casual dining options near my house though I'll keep coming back.",

    "text": "If I was rating on the food alone, I would have given this place much higher. The jalapeno wrapped sweet potato tots were perfectly caramelized and delicious with just enough of a kick. The buffalo chicken sandwich was on one of the most terrific pretzel rolls I've ever had with really tasty and savory sauce and what I assume to be homemade fancy mayo spread. Everyone's food looked wonderful, and when they were done plates looked pretty empty.  The first thing that put me off though is that this place seems to have a bit of an identity crisis going on. The name suggests a simple, laid back, friendly local place without many frills. I certainly didn't expect a place where if I wanted fries with my burger I'd have to order them a la carte....but you do. Additionally, I'm not sure what mood the decor is trying to set - there's some old west elements, some items that suggest european travel, and then some items that are antique-like. What? Yeah. So, out the gate: the atmosphere is a no go for me, and it's pricier than expected, so, wah wah. And the friendly part? Well, I kind of felt like we were strangers crashing the party. No one was outwardly rude, but I felt like they were all stealing glances at the unfamiliar people in the dining area.  Before our drink order could be taken, two of the waitstaff were bickering - in front of us - over who would take our table. I can't blame them really, the place was dead on a Saturday night. I'd fight for a table too if I was a waitress there. After that service was more professional, however refills on my soda were pretty slow and hard to come by, which just so happens to be something I can't stand. When I paid my $19 and change bill with two 20s, the waiter apologized but said he didn't have any change so I could leave a tip. Seriously? You're nearing the end of the night and don't have a ten and two fives? Whathuck??  I think maybe this is a great hang out for the local regulars, but we just felt a little out of place. I MAY go back in the future (with exact change!) and reassess since now at least I know what to expect because as I said, the food WAS good, but trust me, I won't be tripping over myself to make it happen.",

For my sandwich I went with the servers recommendation and opted for the chicken salad. Wow lemon aioli is amazing on chicken salad- and I have to say this is one of the best (if not the best) one I have had the pleasure of trying! The potato salad is a bit bland...but I am finicky about this as my mom makes the absolute best. The chips weren't homemade as I expected but rather bagged. They were tasty but really if you're a restaurant  you have no business serving packaged sides, in my opinion.

On to the food...the tots are what my husband reserves for his reward after a ten mile run. Apparently they are that good. I'm a limited meat eater, and usually find options or ask for a menu modification, which has never been a problem. Many appetizer portions, especially the goat cheese bread, are large enough for a main. The Latin wedge has maybe the best salad dressing in this solar system.  The fried chicken sandwich is great, and has 2 chicken breasts.  I happen to love the Spicy Sprinkle for the heat and dimension it brings to her fries.   She has great wine specials during the week, and usually something fun or special on the drink menu for the weekend. Lots of her ingredients are local and organic and meals are well priced. Bottom line-cozy and comfortable, excellent food for an excellent price.",

Casual, but the food is well thought out like it is at more upscale eateries. (Can't stand dressing up for a good meal when you don't want to!)  Standouts:   -- Bacon wrapped tater tots.  You'll get two kinds, served skewered and propped up in a little cone-shaped wire basket. They're deep fried for extra crispness and the bacon's glazed with sweetness. NOMNOMNOM!  -- Corn nuggests. Asian restaurants have corn croquettes and corn nugget like dishes, and this one is light, but rich and creamy. It comes with a creamy goat cheese ranch dipping sauce, adding to the decadence. The goat cheese added a nice tang too.   Salads-- either the Greek or Latin wedge, I had both.  Flavorful, and fresh, you can tell the dressings aren't bottled preservative JUNK.   The mains, I wasn't so floored by, but they were good.  Let's just skip to dessert.   The bread pudding is sweet and rich and caramel-y...the coconut cake is dotted with big juicy blackberries.

    "text": "I would relate my first experience at Fran's to the feeling you get when you find a $20 bill in your coat from the previous winter. Living in the shadow of Ru Sans, this place is easily overlooked but undeservedly so!   Walking in, you are immediately presented with a small and warmly decorated room. On the left side is a full service bar and the right houses 15-20 tables, about 2/3rds of which were occupied at my arrival. Beyond the front room is another smaller area which is open to the kitchen and walk in fridge, definitely a tad eccentric but adds to the casual ambiance of the place.   My guest and I were promptly seated in the front room and asked for drink orders. For all of you soda-shoppe-esque ice lovers, Fran's got it. Her diverse menu boasts everything from burgers and pasta dishes to her allegedly famous bacon-wrapped tater tots. No, I did not mis-type, she actually has bacon-wrapped tater tots... Love at first sight? Maybe. I ordered the tots, a meatloaf entree and a side of mac and cheese.   The food took its time coming out, but I barely noticed. Neither did my guest. It's hard to place a finger on it, but something about Fran's unique atmosphere allows for a dining experience that makes you want to spend hours there, and I am usually the patron who likes to be in and out in less than an hour; 45 minutes is pushing it. Fran's is a great place to go if you actually want to enjoy the presence of your guest, maybe even get lost in a conversation or two.   The food was unsurprisingly as good as it sounded on the menu. The bacon-wrapped tater tots came out in an artful display: an ice-cream cone-shaped wire holder bore a salad assortment with three skewers that held the tots (see pics). They were unlike anything I had ever tasted before--themselves alone worth the trip. The meatloaf and mashed potatoes that came with them were also very tasty, and more than I could eat. The highlight of my meal, however, was the mac and cheese. I don't know how Fran's does it, or even how to describe it, but it was probably one of richest mac and cheese dishes I have ever had.  Our server was fantastic. I don't think I have ever had a waiter that stayed on top of my water level as meticulously and unobtrusively as ours did. Nice job, Fran.   Whether you're dining with a book club, planning a girls night out or just a date night with your spouse, Fran's is the perfect place for every occasion. Thank you, Fran, for a great meal and a one-of-a-kind dining experience! PS- you need a website!",

Tonight I had dinner there for the first time and got the fig, goat cheese, and Brie flatbread. It was amazing!! My boyfriend always gets the burger, which comes with the yummiest fries.  The service is great! Our waters are always full and the servers are pleasant and not pushy. I also really enjoy the ambiance. From the paint color, the lighting, and the flowers outside- it's just very relaxing and pleasant.  If you haven't tried Fran's, you need to give it a shot! It's a great place to add to the mix.",

For dinner, we got some burger that was on a pretzel roll, and it was enjoyable. Maybe it was a little bit too greasy, but it's a burger, so I cannot really say much there.  The fries were maybe a little bit under fried, but they were ok.  Fran's was a little bit of a weird place for me.  It was good, but some reason it left us a little flat.  It's kind of like a 1st or 2nd guy off the bench....solid role player, hustles and plays D, but you are not looking to play this guy in any meaningful crunch time minutes.",

    "text": "Went here with my husband a few days ago and was severely disappointed. After reading all the positive yelp reviews I was excited to go here. Upon arriving we were told by Fran that our table had been given away because we were \"late\". When we made our reservation we were not told about any late policy but said we would be there in 15 and they said ok. So to hear that they had just given our table away \"45 seconds ago\" really passed me off. Why ask for a cell phone number if you aren't going to call before giving our table away?  Fran came off very abrasive and I was ready to walk out.  I could write about the terrible wait staff and how the waitress only took my husband's drink order and walked away without even letting me order. But I'll get to the food...  The food. After waiting an hour and a half for our food to come out...and it sitting in the window for 15 mins before being brought to us... Nothing to write home about. We had the bacon covered tater tots and corn nuggets for appetizers. Overpriced... we got 9 tater tots and 10 corn nuggets for $8 a piece. Our burgers were cooked completely different...His was medium rare and mine was well done. The waitress did not ask how we wanted them cooked. The fries, boasted to be the \"Best in Charlotte\" were anything but. My fries were limp and not fully cooked while my husband's were over cooked.  The seating was very cramped and the decor was lacking. Fran came by our table and was very condescending when asking if everything was ok. Our waitress didn't tell us the specials or even ask if we wanted dessert. Just brought us the check. Thank god she did.  $55 for burgers and 2 appetizers?  We will never be coming here again.",

    "text": "There was good, then bad, then good then bad so I landed at 3 stars for good old Franny.  The Good?  The bacon-wrapped sweet potato tots.  I sucked those things up like a hoover---they were so good and I was SO hungry.  They took awhile to come out so I was ready grub.  The Veggie burger on a pretzel roll was very good.  The tomato chutney and feta on top made it very tasty.  I ordered a side of brussel sprouts and they were okay...not necessarily chopped or cut or cooked the way I like but they were decent.  The Bad?  They apparently had some computer issues that night and we were there for nearly an hour and a half before our food came out.  Ridiculous.  We ordered burgers!  The waitress checked on us a few times but it still was so annoying.  Fran eventually came out and let us know what happened and that everything would be out soon.  She offered to buy us both a beer for waiting, which truthfully was the least that she could do.  She was nice but not very warm.  My husband enjoyed his burger but it was small.  The fries that are the \"best in Charlotte\" were some of the worst I have had personally.  Maybe they were in a rush because we already waited an hour so they didn't cook them all the way through?  They were fresh cut which I appreciate but they were limp and smelled like the skin of a potato which just grossed me out.  You know that skin/dirt smell you get when peeling a potato?  Yeah, that smell.  The prices were high for what we ordered.  I just wasn't that impressed. I guess I wasn't sure what to expect...it is somewhat of a diner/cafe/nice restaurant.  It definitely wins the award for being most unique...I'm just not convinced that is a good thing.",

The sign is small and hard to read as you drive by so be watchful or you will miss it!!!  Some of the reviews I had said service was bad or it was unclean. I experienced neither I will say it was pouring rain so it wasn't super crowded that night.  My waitress was very friendly and helpful.  The place was very clean as far as I could tell except the bathroom was kinda run down and needed some fixing!  We started with maple bacon wrapped tater tots.  The bacon was perfectly cooked and crispy, and the maple glaze added sweetness to balance the salty. They were sooo good I will say a little pricey I think 10 bucks for 9?   I ordered the California style burger with havarti cheese and avocados (amazing combination).  I have no idea what bread they used but it was a great burger I hope to go back and try more of the menu!",

No pasta to wade through.  However, it didn't stand out to me.  I had forgotten what I had eaten by the time I wrote this review.   Service was a little slow, but we had a big table.  That is understandable.   I am glad that I gave Fran's a try and will come by again.",

Bacon wrapped tater tots, mussels, frites, calamari, and fig and goat cheese flatbread. All tasty and served at the right temperature. The calamari was served crispy on top of marinara. I like this since I love plenty of marinara and you couple scoop out the sauce with the food. The frites were garlic and parmesan.  Nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The bacon wrapped tater tots had a slight spicy kick to them, yum. And the flatbread was a nice flavor with the fig jam on the bottom topped with the melted cheese.. These 5 apps and a bottle of wine ($35) were ~$75,  a very reasonable price. The waitress was knowledgeable and attentive. And they served a free piece of cake for our birthday companion. We went on a Monday night, here were a few other tables filled with guests, but not a busy night. It was a great experience and I will definitely go again.",

Both times the mixed drinks were not very good - one I sent back.   Go for a standard and skip the creative.    The food can be very good or very boring.   On my recent visit, they were out of salmon - at 6:30 on a Friday night???  When salmon is not only an option for every salad but also the main fish entree?   Fran's is a local hangout so I suppose if you live nearby you enjoy seeing people you know but it has a cold decor.    The back room feels like a conference room.   The first time the service was great.   The second visit it was passable.",

I had actually been here the week prior and ordered the same salad, Arugula Berry with Grilled Chicken, and it was amazing - so good I had to come back. I have to say this time around, aside from the dead bug, the salad was missing the blueberries and the chicken was pretty dry compared to last time. My mom, who ordered a sandwich, had to change out the bread because it felt and tasted stale (her chicken was great though, as were her fries). I'm normally not a picky diner, and hate to complain having worked in restaurants before, but this entire experience was just off. The bug sealed the deal, and I won't be returning.",

We were only one of two tables at the time and yet the service(mainly the time to get the food) was very very slow. Server didn't know menu items. My tuna for the tuna tacos was very rare, server didn't even asked how I wanted it cooked. Both my tuna tacos and my mother's beef tacos had zero flavor. None. The server never once asked how things were, if we needed anything, etc, and even seemed to actively ignore us. Again, it was not busy-Two servers and only four tables, so not busy. I can only hope it was his first day on his own. $28 for undercooked, bland food and poor service. Will probably not go again, DEFINITELY not what it used to be.",

    "text": "Four years later and I am still a fan of Fran's although until recently it's been over a year since I've been there.    Fran's has been renovated a bit since my visit last year.  It's been painted a gray/blue color, they built a bar in the back outside of the kitchen pickup window and there are a few pub tables there. The have a new room for groups off to the side apparently taking over part of the space next door.  With the bar addition, they added a beer cooler and additional taps which feature all local breweries.  Foodwise, Fran's still rocks. The menu has changed a bit but there are still the standards like meatballs and bacon wrapped tater tots.  On my two recent visits here, I had the fish tacos which were excellent. The fish changes depending on what is available. I've also had the panzanella salad which was amazing with beets, sweet potato, shaved brussels sprouts.  Other people I was dining with had the lamb burger which they raved about, and flatbread pizzas.  So if you haven't been to Fran's in a while, definitely come back and check them out! Very happy to have them in my neighborhood. And with the recent bar addition, I have a local place to just chill and have a beer.",

It's difficult for me to give 5 stars to any restaurant, but Fran's dedication to great food and unique taste definitely deserves it. Sandwiches are the mainstay of the lunch menu and you really can't wrong with any of them. I HIGHLY recommend the bacon wrapped tater tots. I have yet to try them out for dinner, but I will soon enough. Service can be a tad bit slow at times, but it's a rather small restaurant with a small staff that takes pride in their work. Once you understand that, the little bit of a wait won't bother you. Fran's will be your new go-to spot for a nice, reasonably priced lunch with friends and family.",

I arrived and joined Jeff, another Meetup member at the bar. Watermelon margaritas were the special cocktail so I chose to go with that, and it did not disappoint. I did enjoy a second, ha ha! After the rest of our group arrived, we were seated at our table, which had been prepped prior to our arrival and was in the middle of the restaurant, overlooking the bar and store front windows. Of our group, we ordered a variety of items, burgers, pizzas and veggie sides, which everyone loved! I chose the pesto chicken pizza, which was cooked to perfection. The crust is more like a thick flatbread, crunchy crust with a perfectly cooked center. There was a great amount of chicken and the pesto was great!  I definitely look forward to getting back soon, to not only check out the bacon wrapped tots, but the brussel sprouts, they looked amazing!",

    "text": "We made reservations for 10pm knowing they closed at 11pm. When we arrived, we were the only ones in the restaurant so service was very swift & our waitress was lovely. Both my boyfriend & I ordered a special; he got a ravioli and I got a burger...both were great.   My only complaint is that if a business says they're open until 11pm, they should remain open until 11pm. By 10:30, candles were blown out, flowers were taken off the tables and the computer monitors were being turned off. From the time we walked in the door it felt like we were there too late to eat. Staff was leaving, things were being cleaned and it was only 10pm on a Friday night. It sounds as though another reviewer showed up for dinner and found the doors locked, I would not be surprised if the lock was turned as we walked out tonight half an hour before closing.   I only make this a point because the mission of this restaurant seems to be one that really wants deliver on atmosphere and the late night visitor doesn't get it...perhaps this restaurant should consider closing early if it doesn't want late business.   Otherwise, food was great & staff seemed friendly. The decor was chic, it seemed clean would make for a great date night.   Best advice? Arrive early & check out the specials!",

Whether you're in the mood to indulge (hello, bacon-wrapped tater tots) or want simple, healthful fare, you'll find it in this casual sun-splashed dining room.  The pan-fried sweet corn nuggets offer a crispy exterior yielding to the moist crunch of the corn and pair perfectly with the cool goat cheese ranch dip.  Fran used to run the now-closed Metropolitan Bakery, and her skills with bread have only improved. If a dish includes bread, you can bet it's house made--and tasty.  Wednesday nights feature half-priced bottles of wine and include an appealing selection. The best time to go is Friday its South of the Border night. When it comes to satisfying a craving for pork carnitas and margaritas, Fran's rivals any Mexican spot in town.",

    "text": "So,  I've kinda been on this secret hunt for a good, down to earth, non chained,  restaurant in Charlotte that I could call my \"go to place\" since I moved here 2 years ago. (man that was a long sentence....)  I didn't have a specific food category I was searching in, I just wanted to stumble upon a place me and Hubs could frequent.    I think I might have just found it.  *cue music*  Hubs and I were invited to a work dinner with some of his  work peers and his boss wanted to go to Fran's.  I knew nothing of Fran's....never heard of it...and didn't even know where it was. His boss didn't even say anything like \"oh this place is awesome\" or \"you're gonna love this place\".  Just told us where to be and what time.   My expectations were LOW.  I just knew that  we had to go because it was for work.  We pulled into the parking lot and when I saw the establishment I was really glad my expectations were already set low.  I kinda sighed and thought \"great...it's going to be like bar food with bar fries and saggy bar hot wings.  gag.\"  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.   Inside, it's like a totally different atmosphere.  I thought \"hmmm this place is cute on the inside....\"  It was basically just my table and about 3 other couples that were there.  It was a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all. It's small though. We had a table of 8.  We had several rounds of the appetizers that was ordered by Hubs' boss.  Even though everything that was ordered was all FRIED, I still wanted to try it.  There were these corn fried hush puppy things that I couldn't get enough off.  I can't remember what they were called but my lawd....it was good.  Then I tried these bacon wrapped tatter tots...what the?!  LOL!  Everything is better with bacon apparently.  YUM.  Then I caught a glimpse of fried pickles.  O.M.*chewing* I LOVE *mouth full of pickles* fried pickles.  I apparently looked like an addict shoving those in my mouth by the fork full.  I haven't had fried pickles in a long time and these were fresh, hot and crispy.  My mouth is watering just typing about them.  I then had the french fries which were ok.  I'm not a fries lover...but they were good. A bit soggy but good.   Now in a food carb coma (and a good one at that)  I had to order an entree.  The menu has  only been out for a week now.  And the waitress was extremely knowledgeable already.  I asked about the lighter food menu options and she was so helpful.  I had the muscles in white wine garlic sauce.  They were off the chain!!! (is that still a cool slang term?) wanted to jump in my bowl and bathe in all that garlicky wine sauce.  mmmmm.   The wine list was not huge HOWEVER they had some really really good wines on that list.  Local beers from Birdsong as well.  My hubs' boss told me the story of Fran's background and who Fran is.  It made my experience even that much better and I can def tell that she loves what she does all because of the food.  Prices were really not that bad.  Sure a burger on a giant pretzel roll will cost you $8 but it's worth it.  That's what Hubs got and it was delicious.  I will pay money for good food.  It's good quality food and the prices are not extremely high.  Wines were about $6-8 a glass and it was a GOOOOD wine.  mmmm... So as you can tell *wiping drool from face*  Fran's touched my food soul.....    I should be doing lunges while I'm typing this.  I'm sure I ate 2000 calories.  But it was worth it.",

Big shocker, I know, but really we couldn't help ourselves. The menu was filled with comfort food goodness.   Inside, Fran's is really adorable. There are about 15 tables and a small bar right at the front. All the servers seem to work together to greet, seat and take care of their customers. I'm a big fan of teamwork.   Once we settled in at the bar, we started with the Fried Pickles and were happy to see a huge portion - one side was spiced, while the other was plain. The flavor was right on and the breading was nice; my only suggestion would be to crisp them up a bit more. For my meal, I ordered the Latin Wedge Salad which is filled with yumness - corn, roasted red peppers, iceberg, creamy sherry vinaigrette, avocado, boatload of cheese and grape tomatoes. The salad was one of the best I've had in Charlotte; it was super flavorful and ginormous.   And of course, I had to try the Mac 'n Cheese, just for research purposes. Holy yum. Again, a huge portion for $6. It's absolutely a meal and half on its own. Per Fran, who is just incredibly sweet and friendly, her 'mazing mac includes cheddar, American and pecorino cheese. The service in total was top notch - all the servers were knowledgeable, laid back and offered great suggestions for we first timers. Although, I was clearly super full, I ordered the Chocolate Cake, again, just to see how it was. (Yeah right)   Now, I'm a huge chocolate fan, but not always a cake fan because of the potential dry factor. I am delighted to say that the chocolate cake was fantastic - moist cake, delectable frosting (not too thick) and a huge scoop of whipped cream AND ice cream. You can say I made room for dessert and planned a long run for the next morning.   I left Fran's Filling station with a super full belly, a huge bag of leftovers and the notion that I certainly want to be a regular here!",

    "text": "Fran's has one of the most ambitious menus in Charlotte. Unfortunately, the execution of the menu is decent at best, extremely subpar at worst.  Yes, they have the famous bacon-wrapped tater tots... but by the time they arrived at our table the tots were cold and the maple glaze has solidified into a gooey mess. As a main, I had the meatballs, which had a good taste, but once again were not hot enough. My friend ordered a salad and opted to get the grilled shrimp. For $5 she got three shrimp, which isn't a bad deal, I guess. But it kicked the cost of the entire salad to $12, and it wasn't worth it at that price.  The service was OK. Our server was friendly, and while he didn't apologize for the slow service or cold food, one got the feeling that it wasn't his fault and the kitchen was having issues. And this was well after the place opened, when most places have all the issues figured out. I'm guessing that the chef is a control freak who insists on doing everything herself, even though food quality suffers for it.",

Portions aren't tiny but not overwhelming, well the deserts are overwhelming. Nice variety of entrees. Ambiance is slick sophisticated yet neighborly. Prices are reasonable, very much so when you consider the menu. And Fran, she's all around, saying hello. It just makes you want to go back. And most important the food is wonderful. One word of warning, share the desert. Don't think of skipping it, but don't try to go it alone.",

    "text": "I went here with a group on a Saturday night. I noticed that it had mixed reviews on yelp but I was invited by  friends so I tried to keep an open mind. The first clue that I had that this  meal was not going to be that good was the fact that at 7:30 pm on a weekend night, there were hardly any people in this restaurant. Other than our party, there were perhaps three other parties in the entire restaurant. Most restaurants in CLT are busy on Saturday nights at that hour.  Basically the actual food does not live up to the menu.  I had the Chicken Marsala, it was not good, very bland, green beans not cooked well, almost raw - I did like  the cauliflower/potato puree. Overall, I felt I was eating a meal prepared for a senior citizen at nursing home who is on a restricted diet. It was just that bland and I left half on the plate and did not get a to go box.  Others in our party had pasta, one was a special and it was sent back because the diner said it tasted like Chef Boyardee (her exact words), the other diner had linguine and hardly ate any of it.  We also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was basically penne shells with very little  cheese sauce  on top, very bland and definitely not the traditional M&C. Both pasta dishes lacked sufficient sauce and seasoning.  The only people who seemed to enjoy their meals were the ones who ordered flatbreads, burgers and the Bass. We got a side of Belgian Frites which were barely warm and nothing special.  Another had the brussels sprouts as a side which I tried and they were dry and had no flavor.  We had two appetizers, the deviled eggs and bacon wrapped tater tots. The tots were great, the eggs, bland, no seasoning and somewhat small. The bread pudding dessert was quite good and others liked the chocolate cake.  In general, it feels like the chef does not taste what she/he is putting out, just churning out dishes with out much regard to the quality and flavor of the food. I gave it two stars since some dishes were a hit and the tots were good, even though my meal was not.   With so many other restaurants to try in CLT, I can't see coming back here for dinner again. You only have one time to make a first impression and this place really missed the mark with me.",

Bacon wrapped tater tots are a house specialty, and lived up to the hype.  The meatball dinner and pepperoni & meatball flatbread were delicious.  The meatballs were soft and and the sauce was light and slightly sweet.  Cakes for dessert were exceptional with the house made whipped cream.  I've been here for lunch in the past, but this was my first dinner and I'm looking forward to going again in the near future.",

We sat ourselves (as prompted) and no one came to the table after several minutes.

Fran's has always been a hot spot for locals.    My main complaint:  The lunch menu is better than the dinner menu.    For us, the stars are the sandwiches that the magazine rave about.  The turkey is just wonderful!  They are absolutely fantastic but are nowhere to be seen in the dinner menu.  We did have salads and veggie burger which were very good.  I nearly gave 2 stars just from the disappointment but there is so much potential.  Easy parking, easy access, great lunch.  Lunch is easy 4-5 stars.  Overall needs some attention.",

    "text": "Another YERRAA challenge, Fran's turned out to be pretty rad!   They've recently remodeled the interior and while the decor is a little confusing (a mix of southwestern color and old timey chotchkeys) the space is pretty comfy, if very open. Tables are painted with varying themes, cute. Service was great, as we had several waiters checking in on us from time to time in addition to our main gal. You gotta love a staff that works together to make sure everyone's happy.  The lunch menu was simple, and somewhat veg-friendly. The specialty sammiches looked awesome (Croque Monsieur, Thanksgiving Stack, other inventive plates), but there was no veg option. You do have the option of assembling your own - choose a bread, cheese, veggie, etc. Salads work the same way - a list of house special concoctions, or build your own. I opted for the soup and salad side of the day, both of which were good - french lentil salad with onions, maters, goat cheese garnish. Tomato bisque, while salty, was very flavorful. A little expensive at $5 for a mug of soup accompanied by captain's wafers, but the cheapness of the salad side offset that to end up at about $8 for my meal. Sammiches are in that same range, and come with chips or a choice from their tasty housemade salads and slaws.  They have a wider range of veg options at night (including the ubiquitous veggie burger), according to our waitress. I'll make a point of coming back, as the flavors and attention to detail at Fran's imply that someone's really thinking about flavor. Lots of potential! Yay!",

Usually I get the same server that just disappears, but during my most recent visit we went from patiently allowing our server to assume we didn't have anywhere to be on a Saturday to figuring out she had just pushed us aside to cater to others, because after my empty water glass sat on the edge of the table (long enough I had to stop eating because I was so thirsty) my wallet did too, and after ten minutes I pulled my credit card out and set that on top, and still waited as she checked on every other table but ours. I honestly don't care if she thought she was going to get a crap tip after the way we were treated (which I wouldn't do), the last thing a table wants is to be completely abandoned, especially in such a small space where you know she can see you!  When she did make it over with the check, even though something told me to look over it, in my rush I just handed her my card. Luckily, she had only charged us an extra dollar for the fries as making it to work on time was more important than getting the dollar taken off.

Despite there being plenty of tables open in the dining room at 11:40 for lunch, we were sat at a table set up in a dark, noisy, back storage area in front of the kitchen. The table was not cleaned as there was dried food bits and such on the table.  It took over 40 minutes after we placed our order to get our food.    We ordered the rosemary black pepper glazed tater tot appetizer and got tater tots wrapped in the most bland bacon covered in pure honey.  There was no rosemary, no pepper, not even a smokey flavor to the bacon.  The honey made it taste even worse. The flavors didn't go well together, at all.  We thought they may have messed up the order, but the description of the other tater tots on the menu was nothing like this either.  Don't know what we were served, but it was not on the menu or enjoyable.  I've never had tasteless bacon like that before, either, by the way.   My #12 pastrami reuben was pretty bad.  The pastrami itself was awful with so much tough gristle that when I took a bite, part of the meat sprung back into the sandwich.  Parts were not able to be chewed because of the tough gristle.  Not a pleasant experience, at all.  My friend's #1 hot turkey bacon Swiss sandwich was not hot and the cheese was not even close to starting to be melted, as the menu description states.  The turkey was cold, not room temp or warm.  Not an enjoyable sandwich.  We doubt it was even heated.  The fries over both of our sandwiches were only partially cooked- like sponges that were limp, shiny, and oozing oil.  They were dumped sloppily over and covering the sandwiches.  You had to dig through the fries to be able to pick up the sandwiches.    Neither of our meals or appetizer should have been served, both from a quality and presentation perspective.   Throughout the bad meal, we had a front row seat to a cook who was having a breakdown, cussing, and hollering at the restaurant staff, belittling them and playing ridiculous games with them that only delayed things being prepared and getting to customers. It was like watching an abusive, alcoholic parent movie on the Lifetime network. Very weird and disturbing. I hope that guy is able to get help.  It's scary that there are people out there like this.  Our experience at Fran's Filling Station was like being in the twilight zone with really bad food that should have never been served.",

They do this every Monday. The fried chicken sandwich was juicy and was served on a pretzel bun which is my favorite type of bun. The fried were crispy and well salted. We will absolutely be coming back!",

Way too much fig and cheese, etc.   Brussel sprouts were awesome!  Not a good outdoor patio.  Won't return.",

I came here for dinner, upon entering the space inside is very cozy and has a nice ambiance to it. We ordered the fried tomatoes to start off with, oh my god this maybe a personal preference  but the goat cheese was SO strong, and the jam that came on the fried tomatoes was super sweet and strong that it overpowered everything. Originally I wanted a veggie order but partway though, the waitress had came out and informed me that the patty broke midway and it was the last one. Which was totally fine and understandable, So I settled on the crab cake instead! Let me just save you the trouble and order the crab cake! It was supper duper yummy, and big enough for 2 to share! We also ordered a flatbread, croque madame it was good as well. My cousin did say that her part of her chicken burger was partly burnt. Overall our experience here wasn't so great but if I had to recommend a dish it would be the crab cake! GET IT!! (:",

    "text": "I looked for someplace close to work with outdoor seating on this beautiful February day. I moved from upstate NY last summer so still pinching myself that I can sit outside in February and enjoy a meal. Yesterday was my birthday so I'm still treating myself like I'm a Queen until March 1 :) There was plenty of outdoor seating and everyone very friendly. The menu is so good I had a hard time deciding what to order. I decided on #10 - the lemon chicken salad with french fries as a side (because who eats a side salad in their birthday month??). I meant to order it on sourdough but didn't specify so it came out on the wheat bread. Good mistake. The bread was incredible..tasted homemade and just beyond good!! Best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had. The lemon aioli spread on the bread added a great flavor. I enjoyed every bite & will be back to try many more menu items. Plus my server's name was also Katie :)",

    "text": "So here's the thing about my husband - he's a casual guy. He'll dress up if I ask him to, but instead I look for place to eat that claims good food in a casual atmosphere. As you may have noticed on this page, Fran's claims to be a casual place for casual attire. Therefore, I made a reservation for two. When we arrived we walked into a front room where we were to be seated. But to the host's dismay, apparently my husband was too casual to sit there with his all black jacket, sneakers and baseball hat. He immediately brought one server up to get her opinion then the owner came over to deal with us. She nicely said, \"We have a table in here but we have a back room too that you might like. It is more cozy and has TVs.\"   TVs? Really?  He wears a baseball cap so you assume we're some monosyllabic couple that would rather spend a night out watching TV?   I was so shocked I just blurted out \"ok, let's go to the back room\". There's where I saw other casually dressed people hidden from the front windows of the restaurant. They were jammed into tiny areas (we got seated so close to another couple that I could almost hear their hearts' beat). The tables were high tops and sticky. We were pressed against the beer cooler with chalkboard paint reading \"Beer is proof that God exists\".   My husband orders a water and I order a gin and tonic. We look at the menu and the first handful of main courses are hamburgers - all super overpriced.   Not interested in the food choices and getting more insulted by the second after it sunk in that we were fine enough to pay the prices that everyone pays but not fine enough to sit in their front room with linen tablecloths; we decided to leave. I paid my 13 dollars for one gin and tonic and we were off.   When I don't even feel welcome enough to want to eat your food then you failed. Enjoy the one star.",

    "text": "My hubby and I tried out Fran's Filling Station based on a recommendation from Nicole W.  She told us this was the place to get some great dessert so I had to go right away.  For some reason I had never noticed Fran's Filling Station despite being in the area several times (I'm at the Run for Your Life store in the same shopping area all the time).  We stopped in for a nice little lunch.  The lunch menu wasn't huge and most of the choices seemed kind of fancy.  I ended up with a hot turkey sandwich with a side of potato salad.  The potato salad lacked flavor and I wouldn't get it again.  The sandwich was very tasty and I had plenty left over for a second meal later.  The hubby got the daily special which was some kind of italian sausage with peppers.  It was ok, but my meal was way better (and he agreed).  Our service was just ok.  Our waitress was friendly but not overly attentive.  Fran came to our table to see how we liked our lunch and she was really sweet.  As promised, the best part of Fran's was definitely the dessert.  We ordered the tuxedo cake and it was outstanding!  Layers of chocolate and white cake with a creamy filling between layers.  Hubby and I were clanking our forks together trying to get the next bite as quick as possible.  One thing that felt off about this place was the music.  We were sitting down for a relaxing lunch and the music playing was bumping stuff like Black Eyed Peas.  Just seemed strange for the crowd and the atmosphere.  Overall the lunch menu seemed a little high priced.  I want to come back to try dinner and I'll definitely be back again for dessert!",

    "text": "I went to Fran's Filling station on a Saturday for lunch.  I wanted to try it out because it had the best french fries in Charlotte,  or so says the Charlotte Observer.  I got there at 11:30 am which is when it opened and there was one other table seated.  My server seemed to pretty casual and laid back.  He asked if it was my first time there and I said yes, so he ran over the menu with me.  He also mentioned that they had a bloody mary bar, but I'm not much of a tomato juice fan so I skipped that.  He went back to check on the specials of the day, while I looked over the menu.  My server came back and went over the daily special which was a turkey sandwich with fried mozzarella sticks.  I ordered that with a side of fries.  While waiting for food a couple of other groups came in.  My food came out after a reasonable wait, even before the two top that had been seated before me.  I ordered a beer to go with my sandwich at that time.  The sandwich was pretty good sized and the amount of fries was ridiculous.  The bread was a nice crusty french bread and it was stuffed so that I could hardly get a bite of it, but I managed.  It was very tasty and very messy.  The fries were a deep dark brown color and almost looked like they were burnt, but they were not.  They were close to being perfect.  The insides were light and fluffy, but the outsides just weren't crisp enough for me, so I was a little disappointed there.  But overall the food was pretty good and reasonably priced, $9.50 for the sandwich plus $1 for the side of fries.  For $10.50 there was enough food there for two meals.  The beer I got was a little pricey, $6.95 for a pint, but it was also pretty good.  If I come back I'll probably skip the beer and just get a sandwich.  My server was very friendly and very laid back, but he did make sure I had what I needed.  If we could give 1/2 stars I would give Fran's 3.5, but I just can't round it up to 4 because of the fries.   So 3 stars it is because Fran's is definitely A-OK in my opinion though.",

The other night I had a delicious spice-crusted salmon over a ragout of artichoke hearts, chickpeas & roasted tomatoes that was as good as any fish dish I've had in months.  My friend had a wild mushroom ravioli with marsala cream & truffle oil that was too die for!!  Fran checks on every table, showing her True passion for hospitality and concern for her guests.  Be patient if you go on a Friday night - that was the night recommended by Charlotte Magazine, so they are packed!!  The staff tries their best to make your experience wonderful and it will be unless you're in a hurry.  Otherwise, a weeknight is a better bet for the same amazing food without the wait.  But I recommend Fran's whenever you go.  So much care for so little money is rare these days.",

I read in the newspaper and the local magazine that Fran's Filling Station had the best French Fries in town. Today, I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal, but the best fries in Charlotte sounded about right, so I went to Fran's to give them a try. An experienced diner can easily spot the signs of a poorly run restaurant. When I arrived, Fran herself took my order, but she may not think as highly of her fries as others because she laughed when I just ordered the Bleu Cheese Fries for lunch (that was a sign #1). Then on my way to the restroom, I heard her tell on of the kitchen staff to go to the store to buy Bleu Cheese (sign #2). While I waited for my order, I overheard Fran yelling at a server to stop talking and go get the drink order for table 4 (sign #3). When the food arrived, it looked greasy (sign #4). It tasted greasy (sign #5). No discernable Bleu Cheese was present by sight or taste (sign #6). I ate a couple of them and left. Asking $5 for a plate of greasy potatoes, Fran owes her relatives who work at the local newspaper and magazine a big favor! Even though it is nearby my office, I'll never go back to Fran Filling Station.",

Not even mentioning the food, which was decent...minus the mussels that made my stomach turn, the level of disrespect and unprofessional behavior displayed by the manager (which I can only assume was Fran) was palpable and disturbing.  On a trip to the bathroom, I overheard the manager screaming profanities at her kitchen and waitstaff.  It was an incredibly hostile dining experience that I will never go back to.  She even yelled at a teenage bus boy \"what is wrong with you?!\"  Running a business is stressful, I understand, and I worked my way through college serving tables.   However, to keep people coming back and wanting to PAY for a meal: 1. Don't curse out your entire staff while there are customers in the building 2. Hire an assistant manager - one who works well with others 3. Try to remember that the happiness of your customers is directly related to that of your staff.  The food took forever to come out and drinks were way over-priced but good luck to Fran's.  I hope others have had better experiences.",

    "text": "The Boyfriend and I tried Fran's for the first time at lunch today, after passing it many a time on our way to Ru San's or Sunset Grille.  We were cheerfully greeted when we came in, and told a table would be cleaned for us shortly.  It was pretty busy, which I took as a good sign.  A quartet of women at the table near the door were finishing up their lunch by splitting two slices of cake, chocolate and (carrot?), which looked pretty delish.  Our waitress was somewhat soft spoken, and didn't mention the specials to us until I asked.  Both of us ordered the #6, french dip-esque sammies.  I ordered the pickled slaw for the side; he ordered fries ($1 extra ).  Our food came out after not too long, but I was momentarily confused at the appearance of piles of fries on both platters.  I brought this to the attention of the waitress, who apologized and said that the kitchen had been mixing things up a lot today.  She started to take my plate away, but I said that it was okay.  She asked if I was sure, and I was, because I didn't want my sandwich to get cold while they replated it with the correct slaw.  It'd probably have been better service if she had just offered to get me some slaw on the side in addition to the wrong fries they sent out, but she didn't. *shrug*  Fries weren't served with ketchup; we had to ask for it, which was brought out in two small plastic single-serve cups. If you're a ketchup fiend (we aren't) you'd probably need to ask for extra.  The good: the sandwiches. OMG, yum. The beef was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The rolls were buttered and crisply toasted, and stood up under the weight of the fillings. The sweet peppers and jalapeno slaw (Boyfriend got it without, but I like the spicy) in the sammie added nice crunch and zing to almost every bite.  The au jus was positively dreamy - the best beef dippin' juice I've ever had.  The meh: the fries.  I'd mentioned to Boyfriend that they were voted best fries in Charlotte, but both of us couldn't figure out why, based on what we were served.  They seemed a bit overcooked, very dark, and were barely lukewarm and thus not very fresh-tasting.  Kind of flabby and floppy.  Some people like that in a fry, but we weren't so impressed.  No room to try the cake ourselves. Maybe another time.  We will definitely go back, because the sandwiches were major noms and I saw several other options I'm keen to try, but next time I think we'll skip the fries.  Hope I'll at least get to sample the pickled slaw.",

I've only been twice, but because they have a mix of smallish plates I've tried quite a few items.  Always coming back to the mussels, though, I have to admit.  Anyway -- the deviled egg of the day was a hit one time and a miss the second time.  But a cool concept anyway.  Seared tuna was tasty, as were roasted tomatoes and \"shrimp two ways\".  The wine list is good and the \"redneck manhattan\" is outstanding.",

    "text": "I was tempted to give Fran's 2 stars because the food was sorta good... but the uncomfortable atmosphere, slack service, and undrinkable margarita weighted my opinion more toward the 1 star rating.  When we got there, the front dining room was almost unbearably hot. We were not offered a reason by the hostess or our waiter but I overheard someone telling another guest that the power had been out earlier. Partially forgiveable but it seems like it would have cooled off at some point while we were there.  Our waiter seemed awkward and uncomfortable speaking with us. But we were tempted by a margarita special and ordered two along with our waters. Mistake number one (other than deciding to try this place). The margaritas were truly undrinkable. Our waiter finally returned (oddly enough with a glass of ice to refresh our almost untouched margaritas) and asked how the drinks were. He seemed startled when we told them how bad they were but made the excuse that he was a \"crappy\" bartender and that they water down their mix with simple syrup, yada yada yada. Instead of offering to have someone else make new drinks for us, he told us they would be \"on the house\" and then left us without even removing the offending drinks.  Another server brought our meals, which were fine. I had the \"great big salad\" with salmon added. Good mix of veggies, somewhat small but tasty piece of salmon, and completely un-flavorful dressing. My husband order the veggie nachos (southwest special night) which looked okay but probably should have been offered as an appetizer.  During our meal, we were visited maybe three times by a server offering water... at least one of those times after my husband's water had been empty for a LONG time (considering how hot it still was in the room, maybe it had evaporated). Our waiter seemed afraid of us now and only checked on us once. When he brought the check, he did apologize once again for being a \"crappy\" bartender though it seemed he was just a bad waiter overall (sorry, he was nice enough but probably should consider a job for which he is more well suited).",

I could stop there and it would be awesome, but the regular tots are painted with a peppery rosemary maple glaze  and the sweet potato tots are glazed with a Tabasco honey.  I paired these with a southern tier ipa.  The hoppiness of the beer went great with the spiciness of the 2 glazes.  Next I had the no. 8, which is the hot pressed ham and swiss (I chose rye and dijon mustard).  Usually I go for a more complex and interesting sandwich at Frans because the are all extraordinarily delicious (e.g. no. 9 the real croque monsieur or no. 2 the thanksgiving every day), but today I felt like keeping it simple.  I have been to Frans at least half a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend grabbing a weekday lunch or taking your time and pairing some cold brews with the food on a Saturday.",

I'd call it an American version of a neighborhood bistro; somewhere you could easily go three times a week for a nice meal.  We had the corn nuggets (yummy!) and calamari (my husband said it was a bit greasy).  Eggplant parmesan and an artichoke chicken special.  The chicken came with roasted potatoes that were cut in a small dice and got nice and crispy.  Everything was very flavorful.  Desert was fantastic.  Delicious bread pudding and perfect chocolate cake.  I told my husband to just come here to pick up some slices for my birthday.  Note:  Portions are large.

The decor to the place was so Blah and the one out of three severs working was running around sweating while the other two did there checkout! Put that all aside its truly about the food right?   Well I had the soup of the day it was good a parsnip and corn Bisque i liked it then my Nicoise Salad with Tuna came....i want to be nice but i really had hoped the cooks would have maybe say cleaned the lettuce so that i wasn't chewing on dirt! It was all wrong in my mouth and all I could do was push it away and throw back my coke! The lettuce was dirty the Tuna wasn't seasoned and was overcooked. My boss was with me and unfortunately had a similar experience with his Meatloaf sandwich he asked for it Hot it came Cold and just not good! Our server was not attentive and didn't catch on that it wasn't good.I love trying new places but this one really surprised me after the review and what Y'all had to say about this place. Maybe it was an off day but it was by far a bad dining experience. I really found the menu to be all over the place too many different style's of cooking the concept needs to be more clear cause its not just south-or southwest cooking. To be honest I'm not too sure what they are going for but maybe they should do something different!!",

The Charlotte magazine voted it in the top 25 restaurants in Charlotte, and I would place it in my top 2 or 3. I loved the menu -- it leans toward the southern and comfort food side of things, but certainly with innovative offerings and choices that made it difficult for me to choose. I took the suggestion of others and had the bacon wrapped tater tots in maple syrup coating -- OMG. They were sinfully delicious, and I ate every one of them. The homemade meatballs served in one of the best marinaras I've tasted in the US was really extraordinary, and I took home half of the portion for lunch the following day. Perhaps my perspective is skewed by NYC and LA, but I thought the prices were incredibly reasonable, especially for the service and the large portions. I loved the experience.",

Finally, a nice down to earth waiter approached us and did not judge us with our casual Sat attire. The food was not great and was disappointed as this was our second visit to Fran's. The first visit was about the same- we had our child with us. Again we did not feel welcomed. So if you are dressed up and want to pay more than what the food is priced and worth- Go to Fran's!",

    "text": "It wasn't my first trip to Fran's and it won't be my last. For what my wife and I were looking for, we had a close to perfect evening. We only wanted a light meal prior to going to the movies. We split the bacon-wrapped tots (maple bacon, not jalapeno bacon). I had the Chinese chicken salad and my wife had the scallop appetizer. Then we finished with a slice of key lime pie.  Our waiter, Todd, paced the meal perfectly. He suggested that since my wife liked lighter beers/ciders that she should try the strawberry lemonade beer they had. It was an excellent suggestion.   What I take away from Fran's in the times I've been there. I does food well and allows you to have a light meal or a full meal with superb choices for each. While the scallop app only comes with 2 pieces, it lays on a bed of Carolina Gold rice and a corn/bacon relish. Everything pairs well and it is an excellent small plate. The chinese chicken salad is dressed ideally for my taste, the chicken is tender and cooked perfectly.   When my wife said she was eyeing the key lime pie earlier in the meal, Todd put a piece aside because they were getting low and they brought it out without it actually being ordered. And I will admit, had we been with certain friends, this would've been made a huge issue and they would've ruined the evening complaining about the presumption. That's not the way I roll. When I go out to dinner, I want to have an enjoyable night and Todd made it enjoyable, and frankly, bringing a dessert we wanted is fine by me - it came off as a caring touch.   That's how I sum up Fran's. I feel comfortable there. I like the food. I like the atmosphere. That's why I'll keep coming back",

I arrived before my wife did and saw that it was mostly empty and that it had a nice patio to enjoy the nice weather. So, I grabbed a book and headed for the door.   Upon being met at the door by the hostess, I was asked whether I had a reservation or not. I told her that I did and she went to look at the computer, which I could plainly see, too. There were only three reservations between 6:30 and 7:15 and, as I said earlier, the restaurant was mostly empty. She then told me that my reservation was for 7:00pm and wanted to know if my guest had arrived yet. I told her that she hadn't, but that I'd like to go ahead and grab a table until she arrived. She grabbed the menus and walked me outside. When she put them on the table, she just stacked everything (menus/specials/utensils) for me to unstack myself. She just seemed to be disgruntled about something, but I shrugged it off.  The waiter (named Todd) came by and he was great. He was personable and knowledgeable about the menu. His recommendations were great. I got the meatballs and orzo. Flavor was great, but the dish was a bit watery because they didn't drain the orzo properly. I'd still get it again, though. My wife got the crab cakes, which she loved because of the amount of crab in them.   Would recommend this place to my friends, but would tell them to ignore any unfriendliness they may encounter at the front door.",

I went to pay for my meal in cash since I actually I had cash on me today. I'm waiting and waiting to be checked out and the waitress finally comes up to me to advise that they had no cash in the restaurant. What?!! Seriously what type of restaurant has no cash? Thankfully I had my bank card and I paid with that. But what if a customer had no bank card on them. You know it could happen. I truly can't wrap my head around this!! No cash, really Fran?! I just don't know about this, it seems suspicious to me. Maybe I was singled out. I mean I can't believe a restaurant would have no cash.",

    "text": "Off night at Fran's  Went Out with friends to celebrate a birthday after bragging on Fran's Filling Station.   I'm embarrassed and sorry I suggested eating there.  Horrible service last night, Friday, August 3, 2018 and food was not good.   The special appetizer, artichoke and crab dip, had no artichokes and I'm not sure any crab was there. Just a hot cheese dip. Not good  The $25.00 steak looked like it had been boiled; gray in color - not seared with no taste,  HORRIBLE, disgraceful   The chicken special of the night was not special and was floating in sauce.  Half of the food was left on the plate it was so bad. Then the waiter was offended and expressed it when we did not want to take the rest home  The salmon was a small, thin, dried out piece of fish.   The senior servers reminded me of used car dealers over selling the food. Their description of the dishes were not what was delivered to the table. Trying to get a second drink or a refill was a challenge. The only time the server was nice was at the end of the meal when the check was brought to the table, and he made a last ditch effort to get a bigger tip.   This experience was so bad  I will not be going back, and I am definitely going to contact the friends I recommend this place to and tell them to stay away,    Very disappointed",

We finished our meal, signed our checks, and less than a minute later, she walks up to our table and says, \"I hate to be inhospitable, but I need your table for people that are waiting.\" Who in their right mind would ever do that to customers who just spent almost $200 on dinner for only 3 people. I told her she was extremely rude and how would you ever tell a customer, who had a reservation and just finished their meal, that they need to leave when they just signed there checks. She says, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I need the table. Definitely do not recommend this place and will never be back here.",

It was not the best, not the worst. The amount of sauce made it worse than it really was.   Desert - Berry crisp - TERRIBLE : First it came cold, then it was hot, but the topping wasn't even cooked all the way through so we're talking raw dough that stretched right off my spoon.   Bottle of wine - my friend ordered for half off Tuesday.   This was my first and last experience coming here, even though it's convenient!!  **  Our waitor seemed to be completely off.  Frank, practically forgot about re filling my water. He didn't check to see how the food was at any course. Frank spent a great deal of time with one couple telling stories, talking and not paying any attention to other guests. The lady who seated us was kind enough to come over a few times even though it clearly wasn't her job. When I asked Frank to describe certain dishes he left out ingredients. For example the berry crisp he left out cherries. And in the pasta dish he didn't mention there was cilantro. Luckily I don't have an aversion or allergy to those, but they should be described properly to make an informed decision.",

    "text": "Last night my boyfriend and I tried out Fran's for restaurant week. Well, we originally decided on a different restaurant, but last minute I had a hunch I needed to switch restaurants. So we picked Fran's since we have never been there before. The menu looked great and it looked like an awesome deal for Restaurant Week. I was really happy that all options on their restaurant week menu were on their regular menu.   We had an 8:15 reservation but were able to seat us when we got there at 8:00. Score! We got a romantic table by the window, which was great. Our waitress was super friendly, but while she said she was not in a rush that night, she definitely talked fast and took our orders quickly. But she was attentive with making sure we had enough water and everything was okay. And when then was an issue with the bill being incorrect, she was super apologetic and took care of it quickly.  We started off our meal with two delicious cocktails: the blackberry mojito and peach mule. Both were incredibly tasty. Not sure they were worth the amount they charged, but they were large enough that they lasted the entire meal...at least mine did!  For the appetizer we split the fig, brie, and goat cheese flatbread. That might have been my favorite thing we ate. It was HUGE and so incredibly cheesy. The sweetness from the fig puree was just perfect. After my boyfriend at his half of it, he said he was afraid to drink his cocktail because he wanted the taste to linger more in his mouth. Well done Fran's!  For our entrees we split the Skirt Steak and the Crab Cakes. Both were excellent. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), but the portion was small compared to the fries. The fries were soooooo delicious. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I could have had a whole meal with those fries! The crab cakes were the perfect mix of crab and filler. They were incredible. I even liked the slaw on it...and I typically hate slaw.  I had chocolate cake for dessert and my boyfriend had the warm bread pudding. He almost licked the plates after we were done eating. I wasn't impressed with the chocolate cake. It was fairly bland and the whipped cream frosting was underwhelming. I wouldn't get that again.  Overall, it was an amazing experience. I want to go back and try a bunch of their other starters. I highly recommend!",

I ordered the shredded brussel sprout appetizer and Fran's Meatball entree on a bed of orzo.  Very good.  The portions were plentiful, too, so they packed up my leftovers to carry home (others did, too, which I consider a good thing).  My server, Tamara did a great job; morever, several other servers were quick to talk, refill my water, etc whenever they saw the need.  Well trained, indeed.  The highlight had to be dessert, which I rarely order.  Key lime cake seemed innocent enough (unless you're my dietician), but holy moly, this piece stood on the plate like the rock of Gibraltar.  It was freakin' huge . . . and awesome, and huge, and awesome.  A True OMG slice of heaven daring me to dig in.  I did!  And I'm coming back for more!",

My mom and I reach got a salad and we shared a bottle of wine and a flatbread- we had so much food! The salads are awesome with extremely fresh ingredients and the perfect amount of dressing. I'm pretty sure the salmon on my mom's salad was the most perfectly prepared piece of salmon I've ever seen. My Latin wedge salad with chicken was to die for and the chicken was flavorful and juicy. We had the fig, brie and goat cheese flat bread which wasn't much to look at but had awesome flavor. I do wish it was actual figs instead of fig jam but it was still very good and I would order again.   The prices are a little higher than I'm used to but everything we had was fresh, well prepared and very high quality. I will definitely be returning to Fran's (my mom is already asking when we can go back!)",

Fried sweet corn with goat cheese ranch dressing?  Meatballs with gooey melted cheese?  Don't mind if I do. - Generous portion size: I like to eat, as does everyone I was with, and we were stuffed after our meal.   - Price: reasonable, especially considering portion size.  The seafood options are a bit more expensive, but that's to be expected.  Minusses - Odd table layout: the front room holds ~10 tables and bar seating, but as you head to the bathroom in the back, there are tables along the hallway and oddly placed near the kitchen pickup window - Menu confusion: Reading the menu, I just want to exclaim \"what IS this place?\"  Deviled eggs, nicoise salad, eggplant parmesan, buffalo fried chicken sandwich, and mussels (three ways: traditional, curry/coconut, or beer/bacon) all co-habitate on the menu.  On one hand, that might mean everyone can find something they like.  On the other hand, it's just weird.  What does Fran's want to be when it grows up?   - Food quality & flavors: it's not bad, but it's not amazing either.  The macaroni & cheese side was bland, the lamb ragu was not as good as it had been talked up to be, the chicken milanese was just so-so.  However, the goat cheese was incredible; the goat cheese ranch dressing is a wonderful little cup of surprise (dunk all the way to the bottom, and you'll be rewarded with chunks of soft goat cheese.  You're welcome) and the goat cheese salad that came with the chicken milanese was my favorite of the whole meal.  Moral of the story: if it has goat cheese, GET IT.",

My wife had the entree order of Mac and cheese--let me just say that I don't get that but the wife thinks it is genius--and she enjoyed it, but thought al dente pasta was odd in this dish.  The next time she tried the meatballs which she liked.  On our first trip we started the the fried-pickles which were really good.  I haven't had the guts to try the Bacon-Wrapped Tater Tots with maple, black pepper & rosemary glaze but one day I will because...well, just because.  I suppose that I have tipped my hand that I will be going back again.  I am determined to like this place.  A waiter told me that the desserts are wonderful and that their chef was really a pastry chef.  Maybe that explains the execution on the food--accurately measured ingredients but not enough heart and soul.  Perhaps I should go right from the tater tots to dessert?",

The service was attentive, and Fran herself checked on us a couple of times.  Good energy to the dinner crowd on a Saturday evening, at least in the main room.

    "text": "Fran's is what you want a local restaurant to be.  It's a small location with a very comfortable feel.  It's casual but not lazy.  The staff and owner are ultra friendly and work really hard.  There is nothing fancy about the decor, tables, chairs but it works.  You want to join in.  Let's get to what matters . . . the food.  I love their food.  It is an interesting blend of simple, comfort food and yet there's a touch of upscale too.  Everything tastes amazing and makes you want more which is a problem because the helpings are generous so I usually leave reconsidering my diet that I keep putting off.  I should give a shout out to one of their appetizers, the bacon wrapped tater tot.  That's right, you read that correctly, tots wrapped in bacon on a skewer.  No more needs to be said.  If I'm trying to find a negative it might be those wanting what Fran's is not.  The bar is pretty simple with a limited wine selection.  My wife loves their flavored martinis and they offer some fun beer so there are choices.  This is not a place to go for a crazy Friday night nor is it a five star restaurant.  I'm glad it's not.  It's not trying to be all things to all people.  It has stayed True to itself.  This is the restaurant Charlotte needs.  It's not a chain and it's not over priced.  This is a great place for friends to gather and enjoy wonderful evening of food, conversation and fun.",

Everything I have had from here has been excellent and I love that Fran herself makes many of the dishes and often times comes out to greet us.  We did a rather large order and carted it all the way to Taylorsville, NC(about an hours drive) for Mother's Day this year.  I highly recommend this little spot, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is to die for and the sweet potato bacon wrapped tater tots aren't too shabby either!",

Her sandwiches (homemade bread) are so good, especially he number 1 & 6 but I would be 50 lbs heavier if I ate those every time, so I stick to mostly salads. The great big with chicken and Latin wedge are my favorites, the dressings are delicious. For dinner, I usually go with a special but my  friend lives for the meatballs or milanese every time, craves them actually. Homemade goodness in every bite, Fran's food is simply divine!",

She had been driving all day and she just wanted something small to munch on.  She was seated and inquired about an item on a kids menu ( I get it's for kids and she's a grown woman) However instead of saying our policy for kids menu is 12 and under or even suggesting something else that would be around the same portion size or price they rudely suggested you sit and think about what else she would like.  She got up and left and felt very insulted.   I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 5 years and I've been approached with the same request a time or two, sometimes you got to let things slide or politely explain how your company operates. (Most of the time people understand)  I have enjoyed Fran's food myself.........I'm just very disappointed that the first place my mother goes in Charlotte was disrespectful towards her.",

Our server didn't smile once, mumbled at each interaction and messed up my order.  I'm sorry, is my business annoying you? I do have to say, the food is usually pretty good.

It was around 10:30am and there was no parking at J Majors so I parked in the next shopping center's parking lot...which was practically empty being that all three restaurants were not open. I start walking down the road and the old hag starts screaming at me and threatening me from her car.  She then started screaming at another couple getting out their car before she even knew where they were going.  It blows my mind how rude and unprofessional she was, all from the comfort of her car.  I will never again support this restaurant and recommend you all do the same.",

Everyone knows Fran's for the incredible lunch sandwhiches but you have to try the dinner menu. My favorite entree is the meatballs. The bacon-wrapped tator tots were delicious and unlike anything I'd ever eaten before.  I give Fran's FIVE STARS because not only is Fran's menu is creative and unique but there is something for everyone on the menu.

We were seated quickly and offered menus and drinks but that's about the last time we received any service without having to ask for it.   Fran, the owner, finally took our order since we didn't seem to have a server. After waiting about an hour and asking three times for the status of our order (and trying to decide if they even had it anywhere), we were frustrated and ready to leave. We made the mistake of staying.   While we were eating and the other two tables were finishing dessert, Fran came out and let both of those tables know that dessert was on the house because of the slow service. She told them this loud enough for us to hear. We were shocked at the unprofessionalism of the owner. We had been there longer and received much worse service and at this point, had done very little complaining - even after I had to go to the bar myself to get a water refill.   We have all been to restaurants before that are busy but this was unacceptable. It's not about the situation, it's about how it's handled and this situation was ignored, just like we were.   I've had two firsts tonight - the first time I paid my bill but didn't leave a tip and the first time I've even reviewed a restaurant negatively.",

It can get crowded on the weekends, so make a reservation and prepare to wait. I've never had to wait for a weekend lunch or weeknight dinner. With its eclectic menu and reasonable prices, it's a great spot for many occasions.   The staff is always friendly, but also seem to never know what's going on/ appear overwhelmed. Once I ordered a manhattan and the bartender used dry vermouth. I noticed later that it's on their martini list. I've had orders arrive without sides or with incorrect sides (I just deal with it, but I'm sure they would fix if asked) and a couple of items on my receipt didn't match the menu prices (again, it was $.50, odd, but I was ready to go).   I try not to eat out if I'm in a rush, so it doesn't bother me. Some of my less patient friends and family members get pretty annoyed at Fran's. I don't care as long as they're nice and the food is tasty.",

Guess it might have something to do with it being wedged between 2 of my fave restaurants in town (Fiamma and RuSan's)...but WOW, guess better late than never?  We started with one of its specialty apps, Bacon-Wrapped Tater Tots, over a bed of lettuce...and they were simply to die for!! Then our entrees were just as Amazing!! My husband had the California Burger, and I think he left thinking it was possibly the best damn burger he's ever had. I ordered Fran's Meatballs, which came with a HUGE portion of cheesy Orzo, even a slice of bread. O-M-G!  So...as for the food, beyond good. Amazing!!! However, sadly, the entire dining experience could have been better.  The restaurant itself was a bit stiff in decor. It's a nice place, in a black-n-white motif, classic, old fashioned style, but it felt somewhat stark and uncomfortable. I did, however, enjoy the overhead music they played...which seemed to range somewhere between folksy to classic pop. I did notice afterwards that they had additional seating areas as you walk toward the back...so the place was much bigger than I had first thought.  The biggest downer was the extremely small table we were led to... initially thinking because we were just a party of 2. That is, when we requested a bigger table in the corner, the waitress made it clear that she was saving that table for a bigger party. Then, in hypocritical fashion, she seated another pair (another party of 2) several minutes afterwards. As it turned out, it was not even a full night, and we could have easily been seated at one of several bigger tables left empty...so that's where my aggravation lies. For that bit of UNcourteous service, I'm docking a star. BTW, our waitress did a fine job, so no problems there...but the table was just way too small, the chairs way too stiff...and overall, not comfortable in the least.  Again, the food was excellent and I would have loved to have given this place 5 stars, but thanks to the stingy seating situation (extremely small table...NOT comfortable), it ruined a 5-star dining experience. Still, for the food alone, we're bound to revisit in the future. If they are generous enough to seat us at a comfortable table next time, I may upgrade the review. :)",

    "text": "Keep going back over and over and this restaurant continues to be one of my favorites in town.  I am even more enamored with it as I get to know Fran and her story and what she has done in her life.  Opening this restaurant was one of her accomplishments that we can all enjoy.  Here is my original review:   Never heard of this gem until a friend pointed out that it had been in the Charlotte Observer as one of the best places for soups and chowders.  On a cold wet day, it seemed like the perfect place to try.  My big question is HOW has this been here for over 8 years and I never knew about it.    I looked at the Yelp reviews prior to going and so many of them mentioned Fran sitting on a stool at the end of the bar.  Sure enough, when we walked in, I immediately noticed a lady at the end of the bar.  Our server confirmed that it was Fran.  I hoped and hoped that she would come to greet us during our visit. I noticed that she was talking with at least one table of customers.    I ordered a chicken salad and a cup of corn chowder and some unsweetened tea.  When the chicken arrived, I was surprised it wasn't in the salad that I expected. It was on a sandwich with lemon alioli.    I must have misread the menu.  Nonetheless it was delicious.  The corn chowder was even better.  It was thick with corn and potatoes.  The unsweetened tea did not taste unsweetened.   The waitress assured me that it was.  I didn't need sweetener in it.  Hm  We loved the atmosphere.  It was tasteful and chic.  The patrons appeared affluent and professional!  We were leaving and I was so disappointed that I hadn't met Fran. After all, she's put together a perfect little spot.   But wait, just as we were exiting, she turned around on her stool and said \"thank you\".   She redeemed herself and I left with a  great feeling about Fran's!  Two thumbs up. I will return.  Soon.",

Waiter came immediately after and asked for my drink order.   I don't wait for people before I start eating and perhaps that's rude but i gave my peoples a heads up cause a chick be hangry, you feel me?   So I'm sitting at the table kinda nodding to the Earth, Wind, and Fire tunes coming from a speaker in the corner. Interesting. Doesn't match the vibe but I can dig it.   The started with the Warm Artichoke and Crab Dip. Waiter told me, \"I'm in for a treat.\" OKAAAY!!! Well I'm looking forward to it cause I ate once today.  I was able to try someone's Flatbread with Brie, figs, and something else. It was pretty good. Kinda on the sweet side but I liked the concept.  I tried my homie's bread and butter with garlic. That was good too.   My Warm Artichoke and Crab dip was delish. A little on the salty side but it was still pretty good.   I ordered the Special Short Ribs which came with green beans and dude said Cauliflower Mash, but it tasted more like potatoes. Either way it was all REALLY GOOD! The meat was so tender and juicy. It could have used a little more flavor, but with the accompanying sides, it was all soo tasty.   All the ladies enjoyed their food.   I'm only taking one star off cause while we weren't rushed, people were starting to pour in about an hour after we got there. So towards the end of dinner, we weren't offered any desserts. I really wanted to try the Apple Pie. I could have asked but it honestly felt like he or they were ready for us to leave to free up the table. Also, while the specials were written on the board, dude didn't let us know about them. No biggie. Maybe next time I'll get there a little early so as not to \"feel\" rushed.   All in all the service and food were great!",

I saw bacon wrapped tots and immediately knew that was a must order. These were delish! I recommend getting the duo so you can try both types.

We ordered the lobster dip for our app. It was served promptly with delicious grilled garlic bread. The wedge salad was big enough for two with a fantastic dressing. The cilantro and corn added a nice touch. My husband had the salmon with broccoli and rice. It had a sweet bourbon glaze that was delicious. The crab cakes were large (and mostly crab) and the slaw and sauce that came with them were lemony and perfect. The NY cheesecake was a perfect size with the best dulce de leche drizzle, fresh whipped cream, and fresh fruit. Hubs got the peanut butter cake. He said it was moist and he loved the fresh fruit on top as well. I had coffee and it was very strong but really good!  The ambiance was cozy and Phillip our server was kind, knowledgeable, and engaging.   Overall great experience. Phillip mentioned that on Mondays and Tuesdays in the Tap room you can bring kids and listed an extensive kid's menu.",

We ordered a bottle of wine.  As a tip, wine bottles are half off on Mondays and Tuesday's!  You can't go wrong with the bacon wrapped tator tots.  I also ordered the eggplant appetizer which was incredible.    For entrees we got the scallops and meatballs.  The scallop dish was a little salty, but the scallops were cooked well.   The meatball entree was delicious.  Order these if you want something more filing!  The best part by far was dessert. The chocolate cake was ahhhhmazing!   The lemon Chiffon cake was incredible as well.",

Not sure they were worth the double digits they cost but I did love the bitter sprouts paired with the tangy, sweet apples. Still not sure how it was catagorized as an appetizer but I'm glad I ordered it. Had a piece of a dinner conpanion's Brie, Fig and Goat Cheese Flatbread and it was delicious! So I'm gonna have to come back again just to get that again and try thr tots.   I ordered the pork chop as an entree and it was flavorful perfection!   Definitely worth the stop in.

She seemed perturbed and said she had to go get it ready.  And also impolitely said to shut the door as we were entering.  We know it's cold but ask nicely! Kicker People: we had reservations!    Server was nice, maybe slightly talkative.  Very helpful in choices.  One party in group didn't get bread with their crab dip (luckily they had already in addition ordered a baguette).  Beers mixed up.  A lot of going in and out of our dining room to check this and that.   Food was fine.  I'm not sure anyone in our party will return.  Mussels special was great- I expected crostini to dip in the sauce;however, server did bring some garlic bread when requested.  Wedge was fine - nothing to write home about.  Appreciated the corn fresh as I could tell was cut off the cob.  My husband said lamb special was okay.  One patron did rave about the pasta he got (tomato based w sausage) so I would recommend that if going.",

We even asked to sit outside and there were plenty of options. The crowd on a Friday night was older and more relaxed than I would've expected, but it was relaxed and quiet, so I'm not complaining.   To drink, I ordered a gin-based cocktail with light citrus-y flavors (I forget the name unfortunately) but it was very refreshing and well-made.   To eat, my fiance and I started with the waffled corn bread with pimento cheese & pepper jelly. This is some of the best pimento I've ever had and it pairs super well with the cornbread and jelly. Highly recommend.  I then balanced out my meal with a very healthy Great Big salad. This is also one of the best salads I've ever had simply due to the variety of toppings that you don't normally see. It was a bed of mixed greens with beets, green beans, goat cheese, garbanzo beans, and sunflower seeds. I ordered the large (meal-sized) with their lemon vinaigrette, which was a great decision!  My fiance ordered the lamb burger which came highly recommended by our server and he was not disappointed. Yummy noises kept coming from across the table during the whole meal haha.",

We've dined here once before and were pleased.  We were one of the first reservations of the night, so before it got too busy, Fran talked to others and us in the dinning room. Quickly things went down hill. The scallops and butternut squash risotto appetizer was one scallop cut in half. Disappointing. The salad was bitter. Disappointing. The lamb chops. Extra tough, fatty and unflavorful. Disappointing. As expected, they allowed me to order a different entree but it was cooked improperly and came out way after my husband was done with his entree. Disappointing. $150 plus tip later and we still got a pizza on the way home.",

Don't miss the Brussels and the bacon wrapped tots, both are so so good!   For the mains, I ordered the crab cakes and they were superb! Comes with a very delicious slaw on the slide. Not overly filling but the perfect amount.  Also at our table the seared tuna and special of the day (I believe it was sirloin and potatoes) and both agreed their plates were equally delicious.   Need to come back on Wednesday when they have a special of burger + fries + a beer, sure can't beat that!",

There were 3 servers when we came. It was a steady paced night. Let's start with appetizers! We ordered the fried green tomatoes and it had an unbelievably overpowering amount of goat cheese. The tomatoes were so thin, all I could taste was goat cheese and the jam they put on it. I got the chicken sandwich and it was fried to a crisp. Not the good crisp, the burnt kind where it makes the chicken dry and it tastes bitter. I loved the kale salad though!! I could eat plates of that.   Our table ordered a flatbread because it was the day's special. I believe they gave another table our flatbread and then realized they did so brought it back and we had to wait for them to bring it back out to us. There seemed to be a lot of confusion that night and a lot of mix ups with orders. The wait was also pretty long too for food. Wasn't overall impressed, but it could've just been an off night!",

We had a pretty large party and we called shared to make reservations and people kept getting added but the staff handled it graciously and accommodated the extra guests well. The server and hostess or manager were professional and polite to our party which included a few of our friends who are deaf.   The food and drink were out fast. The fried green tomatoes were not your regular breaded fruit but had really flavorful toppings that made up for the lack of flavor in the breading and on the tomato itself. Think of it like the fried green tomato was a cracker and they topped it with fig jelly, cilantro or parsley, and feta.   I ordered the #8 with fries. The fries were fried in an oil that made them dark. They had little salt and so all I tasted was the oil. I asked for chips but, as they're house made, they bore the same result and they were limp when I got them. My friends got the potato soup and said it was really good, though.   The bread was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, which I like but not nearly enough meat to balance how much bread and cheese I had in each bite. The sweet tea was not sweet at all so I'm thankful I had an Arnold Palmer as the lemonade gave it a little more sweetness.   The pricing wasn't bad. It's close to uptown and the wait was short.",

    "text": "We've been to Fran's a couple of times, and wish we lived closer to take advantage of their weekday specials (like World Cuisine on Thursday).  But their regular menu has a few delicious staples that we'll always repeat, and they do have weekend specials as well.  We tried them during Restaurant Week, and they are only a good value if you get the more expensive items on the menu.  We prefer going during non-Restaurant Week, honestly.  It's less crowded, too.  We've tried several of the appetizers, and like their kale salad, bacon wrapped tots, and their cheesy bacon hush puppies (huge portion, but worth it, when they offer as a special).  I only wish they had more options without goat cheese and sweet sauces, because I'm not a fan of either.    Their meatballs are DIVINE.  We like them with the cheesy orzo (because, why not?).  You get two huge meatballs that taste like mine, so I'm betting they are made with beef, pork, and veal.  The orzo is cooked just right, and they are served with a tangy tomato sauce, melted mozzarella, and grated Parmesan.    Their crabcakes are very good as well.  They have very little filler, and are very filling.    Their burgers are also quite delicious.  They are served on a soft, extremely tasty pretzel roll, and you can choose your meat and style.  Recently, my husband ordered his burger medium-rare and it came out more medium, but it was still juicy and delicious.  You can choose fries, kale salad, or half of each as your side.  Whatever you choose, they aren't skimpy on the portions.  Their cocktails are a bit on the watery side (far too much ice!), and I'll likely get wine or water next time.  Fool me twice, you know?  They have a great beer selection, though.  We'll definitely keep returning!",

The server was friendly. I got the tots and my husband got the mussels. Both were delicious.   After we got our appetizers, we waited a good 40 mins for our entrees. The server told us that the kitchen was backed up and apologized. No biggie. But when we got served our food, it was two completely different dishes. I got the meatball orzo and my hubs got the snapper. We were served chicken and something else. We told him it wasn't our order and the server looked confused. He took the food back and we waited again for our food. We were done eating our appetizers and saw a couple get sat. They got their appetizers and entrees all while we were waiting on our food. We finally got our food. We were both happy with our orders. The meatballs were delicious and soft. The orzo was cooked really well. My husband's snapper was very fresh and tasty.   Since we were there for a long time we decided to get our desserts to go. The server said he was sorry again for the confusion and the comped our appetizers. We got the check and saw that the order was put in wrong that's why we waited so long. Overall, it was a good experience. The food made up for it. We would definitely come back to try their regular menu.",

    "text": "Well I can say that I truly got my fill at Fran's! A group of my fellow Yelp ladies and I came on a Monday evening during wine and tapas week and I wasn't sure what to expect portion-wise. When it comes to these promotional foodie weeks, I know a lot of restaurants like to tweak their normal offerings and portions. However, Fran's fully delivered on providing ample portions.  We arrived to a mostly empty restaurant, with only the front of the house being occupied. It's a deceptively big restaurant with two larger dining sections in the back. Big plus? No need to worry about parking because they share a large parking lot with the other stores in the shopping center.  I was quite tempted by a number of things on their wine & tapas week menu and made a last minute decision to go with the fried green tomatoes and bacon-wrapped sweet potato tots. I started off my meal with a petite syrah but was a little disappointed that it wasn't a tad colder.  Everyone placed their orders and then it felt like we waited for quite a while for the food to come out. Once it did, the plates came out in a staggered fashion. I'd read previous reviews and mostly everyone mentions the bacon wrapped tots. I was very pleased with them - sweet and easily poppable. They would be so good on top of a salad. Yup, a salad.  The fried green tomatoes were good but a little more sweet than I was expecting. I can't say that I would order those again. Since flatbreads were on special that night (they're $10 every Monday), I placed an order for the fig and goat cheese flat bread to-go. It is HUGE and I must say, it was even better warmed up the next day.  After months of having this place bookmarked, I'm so glad that I can report back on Fran's providing a delicious dining experience. I look forward to going back!",

I like the eclectic menu, it's not the usual boring..... burger, some sort of chicken, some sort of fish, sandwich with some canned choices of a side dish. Oh No,  Fran's menu is pure innovation. My server was well versed with the specials of the day and gave great service.  I got the sense that they mix it up in there from day to day.    I had what they called a meatball slider and Madone was it good.  I had a side of Mac and Cheese (which I consider myself a M-&-C connoisseur)  Even the Mac and Cheese had a Fran twist that separates it from the pack using several shapes of pasta and a few different cheeses.  It was the best M-&-C I've ever had in Charlotte (including what used to be my favorites Lupie's and Mac's BBQ).  I was also impressed with the presentation. My ten dollar lunch was presented and garnished with the care, pride and attention like that of a Saturday Night, Uptown $50 Entree at the newest sheik place with a trendy one syllable name.   The tableware was really cool and retro styled (Melmac or Fiestaware like) very fitting of the charming-ness and uniqueness of Fran's.  Fran came out, introduced herself, welcomed me, asked what I thought and even gave me a couple of cookies.  How great is that?  In short, awesome menu, excellent service at a great value.  Should I become a serial killer (though not likely), get captured, found guilty and sentenced to the death penalty, I want my last meal to be Fran's Mac and Cheese.",

SO WEIRD!  I spent the rest of my time there (and truthfully much of the rest of the day) wondering what the heck made the place smell so strange. Was it a candle? If so, \"Bad Fran! No smelly candles near food!\"   Was it something in the kitchen (what sandwiches have ginger in them?)? Perhaps they  were brewing up a big pot of ginger tea somewhere (Which is totally disgusting).    My sandwich was good (included what looked like home-made bacon!), and the potato salad was very good.  It was refreshing to experience a mayo-based potato salad that actually had flavor and wasn't overly mayo'd.   I may go back.  And hopefully I won't leave with that ginger smell in my hair again.   PS I hate ginger!",

    "text": "Maybe we hit it on an off night?  We'd heard so many great things about Fran's... especially their veggie burger.  So, we finally decided to go give it a try.    I was totally thrown off when we walked in the place.  It was very nice... almost too nice... especially considering the name.  And likewise, the prices were very nice.  Much more than we expected for a \"filling station\" but we'd talked about giving it a try for so long we decided to splurge.  After viewing the menu, I was so intrigued by the blue corn meal crusted calamari, that I decided to skip out on the veggie burger, and ordered the calamari and the \"best fries in Charlotte\".  The calamari was super super salty and sort of soggy.  Not very appetizing.  I tried to flake off the corn meal crust but it was stuck on, along with all the salt.  Between 2 of us we couldn't even finish them and they were just an appetizer size.  The fries were okay, but I wouldn't say \"the best\".    The best part of the veggie burger (which Ben still ordered as planned) was the special carrot relish/salad.  But the actual burger wasn't that great and fell apart with the slightest touch.  Overall we were pretty disappointed and most likely won't be back to give it another go.",

And check our their bacon wrapped tater tots!   Overall a great experience to enjoy a great meal and a neighborhood gem  **** As an update we went back - twice; once for lunch and once for dinner. For lunch I had their winter BLT. Quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had. They use a basil pesto with roasted tomatoes and of course bacon. A superb flavor combination.   At dinner, I did the specials all the way. That evening they had a short-rib appetizer garnished with crispy onions ... So very good. Absolute compliments to the kitchen interns of preparation. I then had bacon and Brussels sprout flatbread. While not advertised - they added a little mustard, which added so much to the flavor.",

Today's special was a chilli cheeseburger with mozzarella cheese on a pretzel bun and a side item. I chose the fries and gladly paid an extra $1 to add parmesan garlic to them. It was messy and sooo good. The burger was so big I couldn't finish all the fries. Eva waited on me and you can tell she enjoys working there and she knows the menu by heart.  I  highly recommend this place and I plan to go back and try several more items on the menu.",

    "text": "Yummy, comfort food!  I like that the owner, Fran, has a strong presence there. The times I've gone she interacts with the patrons, helps her servers, or is relaxing at the bar. It's nice to see her so involved!  The food is tasty. If you are a vegetarian, or limit meat eating (like me), there are really only two entrees, not counting salads: veggie burger, eggplant parmesan. The fried corn poppers are sweet and pair well with ranch dressing!  The atmosphere varies depending on the crowd. I envision Fran's as an intimate, yet casual dining area with a laid-back staff...but get the place full and it becomes a very loud, slightly chaotic place with servers running from one table to the next. Perhaps it was due to a really busy week at work and I was tired, but watching the hustle and bustle from the servers made me feel a tad anxious rather than being able to relax during dinner. In addition, one of my requests was forgotten and I felt rushed when speaking to my server (for instance, I felt it would take a while for our server to return, so I asked for a box and the check in one breath and had my credit card in hand to give over).    Overall, each time I've stopped in I've had good food and a pretty good time. It's a pretty popular place and definitely one to check out!",

The place is a little small but that adds to its charm and quaintness.  The inside of the restaurant is much nicer than the strip mall exterior and \"filling station\" name would lead you to believe.  As well, the food and service is much better also.  Because of the size of the restaurant it can be difficult for the business to handle large parties.  However, we called ahead to let them know we were coming.  They seated us in a back room that was just large enough to handle our group of 18.  We did have to sit at separate tables but this actually worked out well.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and very friendly, even though we ran her to death.  The group got a variety of items from the mussels to the brisket, and everyone enjoyed their meals.  Even with a large group all the meals came out pretty quickly and very close together.  No one was left waiting while others were eating!  Kudos to the chef and owner/manager.  We highly recommend Fran's Filling Station for a delicious meal.",

    "text": "Bart was bummed out at work today, and he wanted a sandwich. But not just any run of the mill mid-week office lunch hour sandwich - he wanted a True to life sandwich experience. There was no doubt where we'd find this. I said, \"Fran's.\" Squirreled away inconspicuously at the corner end of the Park Square shopping center in Dilworth, Fran's Filling Station is an unfortunately all-too-often overlooked lunch spot in the greater Park Road area. Surrounded by so many mediocre options in that area that our coworkers are so often complacently willing to settle on - Jason's Deli, McAlister's, Which-Wich, Penn Station, etc. - I felt in Bart's diminished mood, he needed a trip to the glorious little hovel of good food that is Fran's.  Not ones to adhere to a conventional businessday lunch hour, we strolled in around 11:15am. There was no one else in the dining room, just a pair of waitresses leaning delicately across the blocked-wood bar, fingers intertwined, elbows crooked and pressed upon, faces plain yet subtly eager with start-of-the-day malaise.  Bart had never been to Fran's. He gestured an approving curl of his lower lip. \"Hmmmmph,\" he said.  I nodded. \"Yep.\" The waitresses greeted us charmingly, as they're apt to do. Fran's isn't a hoity establishment. It's a classic southern cafe, done up in folksy art, hand-painted table tops under heavy lacquer, fresh flower bouquets, etched wood carvings, and clever 60s/70s era pop art adorning the brick walls. You feel like you're all friends there, like you're all in this together, like you just walked onto the set of Fried Green Tomatoes or something.  Our waitress came over, smiling wide, a gorgeous creature, tall and well-shaped, broad shoulders and hips, a strong core, thin neck and soft cheeks, long brown pony swinging playfully behind her like a mane. I eased back in my chair, stuffed my fingers in my pockets, and stretched a tight-lipped grin. \"What are you guys drinking?\" she asked.  I glanced at Bart and his frumpish scowl, then down at the menus our waitress was placing before us. I cocked my head as a wily thought entered: beer. I nudged Bart and chinned toward the bar. \"What ARE we drinking?\" I asked.  Bart's scowl lifted into an illuminated beam. \"Whoah...\" he eased out in a breath of unanticipated joy. \"They have great beers...\" Bird Song, Southern Tier, Natty Greene's, wine, liquor, more beer. The waitress saw us eyeing the bar and let out a little chortle. \"Do you guys want a beer list?\" she asked. \"We don't usually get many people ordering beer at 11am on a Wednesday.\"  We shrugged incredulously. That notion just seemed silly.  We each opted for a Southern Tier IPA, and then our marvelously-built waitress left us to our perusing of the menu. As we were reading through the mind-blowing list of fried appetizers, decadent salads, opulent burgers, and mouth-wateringly descriptive signature sandwiches, I recognized the opening horns of Born to Run floating down from the overhead speakers. \"Springsteen,\" I acknowledged aloud, forefinger pointed to the sky. Bart nodded approvingly.  \"Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out ov-er the liiine,\" I sang. \"HOoo-whoooahhh!\" I rapped my thumbs sideways across the slick wood finish of the table and stamped my heels into the flat of the cement floor.  Our waitress returned with our beers, her own mood clearly lifted by the good time Bart and I were starting to have. She took our orders. I went with the number 4 - a chicken salad sandwich with lemon aioli, avocado, and pickled red onion strings. Bart ordered the Reuben, and we each chose the farmhouse style cottage cheese as our side. \"And another beer?\" she asked before leaving. We smiled and nodded.  Springsteen ended and we both paused with bated breath for what might come next. The opening chords rang out and we both lit up - Alanis Morissette! But not You Oughta Know or Ironic or even All I Really Want... Nope, it was m-f'in Head Over Feet. I belted out, \"Are you kidding me right now?\" Bart nodded approvingly.  \"You've al-ready w'ON mee ooo-varr... in-spite uv meee,\" we sang in gorgeous, baritone harmony. \"So don't be al'ARMED if I faa-aall... hyead ov-ar feeet.\" Our food arrived with our second beers - beautifully stacked trays of tall sandwiches, mounded with meat and sauce, overflowing cups of seasoned and garnished cottage cheese, face-fuming aromas of spice and dough and dairy, like a farm, like a fable. We stuffed our mouths, silly and contented,  avocado glaze speckling my beard, napkins ruined, shirts spotted, beer spilled and lyrics slurred ignominiously to every tune soaring above us.  We ordered another beer, had our leftovers boxed, and cleaned up our ridiculous Wednesday mess. When our trim waitress returned with the check, Bart fumbled around under his ass for a moment, face locked in embarrassment and concern. \"I don't have my wallet...\"   I laughed. \"Don't sweat it; this one's on me.\" Bart finished the rest of his day in a fantastic mood.",

I always go with the intention of ordering their really excellent salads but as I am sitting checking out the menu I am also checking out the plates on the surrounding tables and  every time those french fries call my name and I order one of their great sandwiches that come with the best french fries around. My two most recent experiences were their excellent lamb burger and their BLT sandwich. They do some sort of seasoning/dressing on their sandwich which is just outstanding. The only reason they do not get five stars is that if I gave them five what would I give Barringtons. Aix, Lumiere, etc",

I find the menu to be a bit pricey for dinner, based on the portions and type of food. We had a round of drinks, and the combo bacon wrapped tator tots to start. I could decide if I prefer the regular or sweet potato tots! My husband ordered the chicken pesto flatbread, which was quite bland and nothing exciting. I had the Latin wedge with grilled chicken. The salad was amazing, so much flavor! I look forward to going back for lunch and enjoying the Latin wedge again.",

Our entrees included chicken Parmesan, gooey meatballs for the kids, chicken sandwiches, and my Moroccan veggie burger. Our sides included the mac & cheese and Brussels sprouts--yum! Desserts we tried were the chocolate cake and coconut cake. Everyone LOVED the food, and our server was great.  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and by the time we left the place was packed.

    "text": "My most recent dinning experience here was my third or fourth time at this restaurant. Every other time I have been here I LOVED it. I especially love the wrapped bacon tots appetizer. Delicious and innovative. So, although this is not a restaurant I frequent often, I had such warm feelings toward it.   My last dinning experience leaves me feeling like I will never come back. Let's start with where I started that evening.  I ordered a new cocktail that they had on the menu. It was a lemonade cocktail that literally tasted like water with about a few lemons in it . No taste of alcohol. Lacking in flavor.   The tater tots, per usual, were superb!!!!!!!!!!! The best of the meal.   As I looked on the entree menu, I was very disappointed that they have scaled back some of the best dishes. Have no clue where they went but they need to bring them back. Settled on the Old School Burger.   This burger only rivals a burger you could get at your local Chili's. Such a travesty at $17.00. Just terrible. There was nothing special about this burger. And this supposed secret sauce that they advertise, well, I didn't taste any sauce.   To put the icing on the cake. My dinner companion had an issue where she was charged an uncharge when she shouldn't have been and one for which the waiter failed to tell her that she would be charged. When having the owner, Fran, come over. She handled herself in a disgusting manner. She told my friend, that avocados are very expensive and that's what the uncharge was. Never a real apology. She made both of us feel uncomfortable with her aggressiveness. The uncharge was around $1.25. We could have bought an entire avocado for that. The owner was so busy telling us the change in price for avocados. Not our problem lady. Make sure your staff is trained properly so they can simply communicate these things. The issue was not the amount but rather the customer service.   Terrible. Such a waste of what use to be a perfection type restaurant.",

As she was putting the food down in front of me, she goes \"oh sorry about that\" and proceeds to take her BARE FINGER to push the salad off the edge and more into the plate.  Salad was overpriced and I obviously didn't end up eating much of it because I was so grossed out.  I regret not saying anything, but it occurred to me that if she is this comfortable handling food with her bare hands literally right in front of customers, who knows what they do in the kitchen.",

    "text": "YUM...sitting in Portofino's one evening, another lady at the bar and I got to chatting about good desserts.  She mentioned Fran's and advised I try it.  Well, I went for lunch on Saturday.  The food was very good, can't wait to get back to try dinner.  We ordered the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich on wheat, and the #1 Turkey sandwich.  The fries were good too.  The potato salad and deviled eggs had a lot to be desired, but the sandwiches were great. We were too full to try dessert, will try on my next visit though.  Also will try the bacon wrapped tater tots.  The sweet tea was nasty!  Boo.",

    "text": "This is Fran's second time working with our meetup group to accomodate a large party. The back room was set up for our party of 12. We started with drinks by the bar, made by a very attentive bartender. Then we migrated to the back room where our server, Katie, got us all waters and took our drink order. I recommend the bacon wrapped potatoe puffs for an appetizer. Others in my party ordered kale salads they say were tasty. For entree: the Fran's meatballs on orzo (you could also get it on kale). YUMMY! Others in my party enjoyed the fish tacos and salmon entree. Fran stopped in a few times to make sure we were doing well. Katie had everything under control! Excellent service.",

    "text": "Hot Chips Made to Order!  Just figuring out the Menu (I can NOT Read Menus) and embarrassed that I have never eaten here, so I ask questions, because the Menu says Chips... I STOP and want to know are they Hot and Made-to-order or are they bagged ? ? ?  My Waitress says, \"They are HOT and Made-to-order\" so I only need to decide what I would like to go with them : How about : Jalapeno Slaw Vinegar Based! Create your own Sandwich : Roast Beast Sandwich!    The Chips were EXAKT!  Super Thinly Sliced, lightly Deep fried, not Crispy, yet still approaching light golden, lightly salted PERFEKT!  Did not need any ranch or even the most tempting Sauce I would have ignored!!!!!  These were so FANTASTIK!  to say I'm a Fan would be a gross understatement, I'm a Franatik!  Create My Own Sandwich sounds like a plan and it was a Masterpiece that might heal some Mental illness (it Healed me) : Here it is: Hot Roast Beef, melted Havarti, Cold Tomatoes, Super thinly Sliced RED Onions (great work) on a Warm (bet it was House Made) Bread (hope the Photos turned out!  This Sandwich is nominate for some Rod0 Awards!  After eating this wonderful food I had just enough Brain Power to search the Menu (I heard some people talking about SWEET Potato CHIPS) Oh I should have Ordered the Sweet Potato Chips ! ! !  So I did!  They were Very Good, should have been Hotter, still Very Good!  Jalapeno Slaw Vinegar Based... a Total Disappointment (back to the Drawing Board)!  If I still lived in Charlotte I would Eat Here so much they would be naming Food after me!",

They took off the best thing they had...  Bring back the Chicken Milanese!!  I probably won't be back because all the good food on the menu has disappeared, sadly.",

They've hired more servers and expanded the dining area in addition to giving the place a fresh coat of paint and new lighting.  I'm so glad we gave Fran and her awesome crew another chance. We now come here a few times each month and couldn't be more pleased.  Our menu favs: the beef skewers, burgers, fig goat cheese flatbread, butternut squash lasagna, Brussels sprouts, and pretty much any of the daily specials.",

Then on to the new south fried chicken sandwich for me and the buffalo fried chicken for my date. Both were perfect, beautifully fried chicken, moist, but super crispy on the outside.  Superb and understated service by our waiter. Will visit again if we ever get back to Charlotte.  Highly recommend, spot on!",
