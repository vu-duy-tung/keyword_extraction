    "text": "My gf and I frequent Sky Sushi when we're passing through. I've tried several of the sushi restaurants closer to our home in Fort Mill, but haven't found anything that we like better than Sky. Azn used to be a favorite of ours when we were in South Park, but without better options closer to home, Sky has sneaked its way into our default place for asian cuisine.   Pros: Fat noodles in the lo mien. Don't know why, but many asian restaurants have started using skinny noodles. Not a fan.   Broccoli was awesome. Some of the best I've had.   The sushi tasted fresh and has been consistent each time we've eaten there. Today I had the Sky roll, which i'll probably get 9/10 times I return.   Cons: Hasn't established itself. Usually kind of empty. Rice in the sushi could be a little better.",

The calamari tasted very doughy and was cut into strips (they looked like French fries in a way) so there was not a lot a meat vs the breading. For dinner, I ordered the pad Thai ($11) and it had NO spice at all and hardly any flavor. My husband got the royal dish ($14) which was to come in a \"spicy garlic sauce\" and we felt that was bland as well (def not spicy or garlicky).  The food here wasn't exactly terrible; it was wasn't very flavorful either.  I can say the lava cake for dessert was pretty amazing ($6).",

Granted it's valentines day, I wanted my food to go. Got there at 7:07pm, was told about 20 min wait. Ok fine - no problem, I understand it's a busy night. Fast forward - 7:55. No food. While I was waiting this is what I observed. Their iPad with reservations went dead. Now people are crawling in with and without reservations and have to wait the SAME time. It looked like an ant farm there. The hostess was hollering for names as if she was at the auction. Who needs loud speaker?! Her receipts where all over the place. She then decided to ask everyone for their name all over again. Wow that should be fun for the guests! At 815 I was no longer hungry, but irritated. When I came up to ask about the status of my order she asks: \"What did you have again?\" - and proceeds to take down my order all over again claiming that's just for her to put it together. Say what?!?! Another 10 min later I asked for a refund. And guess what?! My order magically arrived. I refused it politely. I mean how long has it been sitting there?! No thanks. (Scratching this spot off my list)",

I've noticed the place, but never stopped in until now, because it seems more bar than restaurant from the outside. The food was really great, which is a nice surprise to me, being a fairly tough one to please when it comes to Oriental cuisine. I've been back several times and been well satisfied with both the sweet/sour chicken and the scallops. I'm NOT a sushi fan, so no rating there, but what troubles me now is that its such a bad location, the traffic is so reduced that I'm sure they must be rethinking the choice, and needing some business. I've scanned these reviews and it seems the opinions are either great or bad. I hope they can continue to build a following, and draw a crowd big enough to sustain themselves. This place is right on a level with P. F. Chang's if you ask me, and thats pretty upscale for Pineville;  it would be a shame to have location be the negative that they can't overcome. I live in Pineville and its nice to have a classy place like this so close by. Try it - you'll like it !",

They gave us a small portion and then halfway through, the waiter came out with another plate of the dish saying that the cook prepared the wrong portion. What's funny or not-so-funny, is that the peas and carrots on this dish were the frozen stuff you can find in the supermarket freezer. C'mon! I can understand the peas but the carrots? Jeez! And we had phoenix and dragon which is two dishes that is chicken in sa cha sauce (so sweet that you can get diabetic attack) and curry shrimp (5 pieces) which is not bad but not great either. Another odd thing was that our food weren't served at the same time and have to wait at least 3 more min for the next dish to be served. Oh well anyway. Ask me if i'm going back to that place? A big fat NO!!!! I'd rather go to a chinese buffet. But then again I won't either.",

I own a non-profit and they also offer a private meeting room, with plenty of amenities. The interior and decor is very nice, that atmosphere is very relaxed, clean, polished and contemporary. Others complain about how dark the parking lot is, it could be brighter, but I mean who is going to get you the Sushi Zombie? Smh this is a great place, go and try them out!!",

Isabel, my server, was quite pleasant, attentive, and patient when I told her I wasn't in a hurry. I never felt rushed and was allowed to relax. Ambience / background music was also decent. It's nice to find a sushi place open all day...a rarity in Charlotte. The only complaint is small in context. Sushi lunch prices, including hot saki, were reasonable and competitive. The only exception was a tasty but overpriced avocado roll, at $5.00. They usually go for $3-3.50 locally. Overall, though, a very enjoyable first visit.",

    "text": "I'm the Groupon Queen these days and I happened to stumble upon a Groupon for Sky Asian Bistro.  Before purchasing, I checked out the Yelp reviews and since most of the reviews were positive and the negative ones were mostly about service (as opposed to quality of food, cleanliness, etc) I decided to give it a whirl!  My husband, my 15 yo son, and I went in for lunch on Saturday.  The decor is nice, the restaurant is very clean, and we were greeted at the door by a hostess with a big smile.  We sat at a booth and our server came right over to take our drink order and to tell us about the March lunch special.    We ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Crab Rangoon Dip for appetizers. I didn't try the chicken lettuce wraps, but the guys really liked it.  I did (overindulge on) the Crab Rangoon dip and it was CRAZY good!   For our entrees, my son had the Sesame Chicken, my husband had Chicken Pad Thai, and I had the Sky Burrito (Shrimp Tempura and veggies wrapped in rice paper served with Bang Bang sauce). We loved everything!   My husband travels quite a bit for his job and always makes a point to have Thai food while he is away and he always has Chicken Pad Thai.   He said that Sky's Pad Thai was some of the tastiest that he has ever had.  I had a bit and have to agree!   It's different from most places so it's possible that it's not as authentic as some places (I could see that turning some people off), but it was absolutely delicious and I know that my husband will want to go back just for the Pad Thai.  My son also had a great first impressions of Sky.  He adores Asian food and for as many Asian restaurants that have been to in the area, he declared this his new favorite...and a great place to take a date (UT OH!).  I really want to go out of my way to comment on the service.  I know that there are always some servers that are better/more friendly than others in every restaurant.  However, we had at least 3 different servers come to our table throughout our meal and they were all very friendly!  We even asked for different sauces, had a bunch of drink refills, and needed our food boxed and we never felt that the staff felt 'put out' by our requests.  At one point my husband engaged in discussion with our main server and it turned into a discussion regarding a particular custom that the waiter experienced as a child.  We loved hearing about it and could have chatting with him all day!  So...I recommend that if anyone is hesitant to try Sky because of the less-than-stellar service reviews, please know that we didn't see any service issues at all!  We had a chance to look at the lunch and dinner menus and I would suggest going for the lunch because the prices are nearly 50% less than dinner and it was a ton of food (we all brought half of our food home, including the Crab Rangoon Dip).",

The fella and I ventured in on a Wednesday night - the evening of the great blizzard of '14 - and there were only a few cars in the parking lot.  Hmmm.  The atmosphere is nice and still has a little Tony Roma's feel, but the service was fast and efficient, and the prices seemed pretty reasonable.  I also appreciated the '80s adult contemporary soundtrack - Christopher Cross, Peter Cetera, and Air Supply are alive and well at Sky, and I loved it.  We started with the bang bang shrimp ($7), and I thought it was much better than Wan Fu's and pretty close to Bonefish, which is my favorite.  For dinner, I got the sweet and sour chicken ($10), and the fella - Mr. Sushi Snob - went out on a limb and got the Sky Roll ($13) and the Salmon Lovers Roll ($13) at the recommendation of all y'all who commented on how good their sushi was.  I braced myself for the inevitable monologue about how hard it is to find good sushi, and what do the Yelpers know, blah blah blah, but he actually really liked it!  This is as rare an occurrence as snow in Charlotte.  The s&s chicken was solid, but my favorite part was that the sauce came on the side instead of smothering the chicken like most places do it.    For our appetizer, two entrees, and two glasses of wine, it was $60, which was much more reasonable with the $25 Groupon.  I hope the light traffic tonight was because of the snow, and I hope Sky does really well here!",

    "text": "The sushi here was very good. Headed out after Black Friday and was surprised to find the restaurant rather empty. Prices are reasonable for the quality and the addition of more traditional Asian dishes makes it a nice gathering place for those who may not eat sushi. The wine list is lower quality but the food doesn't beckon a higher quality wine offering so it's reasonable. My main suggestion is that they replace the plastic menus as it seems to lower the overall experience. The sushi stack was excellent.",

OMG YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!!! Trust me, I'm an expert.  We tend to stick with what we like so That's how we Roll, Salmon Levers and something else were all excellent.    The place was pretty full, and I know they have a Groupon, Living Social and Amazon Local deal going so I hope it keeps up.  This place rocks.    One thing though, our waiter was obviously a smoker and reeked of cigarette smoke.  So much so that our glasses when he placed them down on the table also smelled like smoke.  I smelled it as soon as he placed them on the table.  GROSS.  I asked for new glasses and told him the deal.  He obviously didn't get the hint that he needed to wash his freakin hands since the new glasses smelled also.  I am willing to overlook this since I love the food so much but that only flys for so long, you know?",

The food was absolutely horrible. Hot and sour soup, one of my favorites, had hard stuff in it.  Hibachi chicken, usually very good, what's the worse. The chicken was very chewy and sauce was thick. The flower shrimp was also poor. Shrimp was overcooked  and sauce was thick  The red Thai curry with tofu was also poor  Tofu was very spongy and tasteless dish I did inform the waitress and she apologize and will let the manager know tomorrow. I'm assuming part of the problem could've been the local weather, it has snowed the day before and maybe the cook did not show up for work anyway I will avoid this place for the next few months.",

The lemon drop roll has become my favorite next to the summer shrimp roll, and the inside out crab rangoon appetizer is perfect \"feel good\" food.

Appearances are important as we all know.  We started with the vegetable tempura, and I must say it was pretty darn good, not the best I have had, but pretty, pretty good. I was able to order my dinner,despite being oggled by the entire staff , guests at other tables, even my friends. In the midst of, carrying the conversation and being completely fascinating, and  not to mention soul shatteringly attractive, I was able to order the sushi combination.  The sushi was insanely fresh! It honestly was more than I expected. Being an awesome boyfriend(probably the best ever) I agreed to eat some of my girlfriends dragon roll, it was awesome. Simply the best dragon roll, I have ever eaten. And let me tell you sister, I have eaten many a dragon roll.  The service was on par and the place was clean. The staff was very pleasant. My only beef was that the decor seemed a bit confused, but that is a minor issue when compared to the painfully delicious sushi I shoved into my stupid face that night,",

Sushi.....I lovve Spicy tuna rolls, super yummy!!! My go to...... Spicy Tuna & Tempura Roll with a side of spicy mayo....AAAAAmazing! There is a lunch special for $10 for 2 rolls which also comes with salad and or soup....I always get the Miso soup. The Lunch Crowd during the week is small, meaning your wait time is short, maybe a 10min wait or less.   Also they have a private room for small gatherings which is nice. I would recommend having a fixed menu or buffet. I attended a Birthday party here, with 2 waiters....all of our checks were incorrect.   Cocktails are amazing! Great wine selection....This is my go-to place in Pineville for sushi, considering I work nearby this is a healthy option instead of grabbing fast food or mall food UGH!!!!!  Looking forward to spending my lunch breaks often.......",

I like that! -friendly service right off the bat. We walked in and promptly got fast and friendly service throughout our entire stay. Thumbs up! -fantastic presentation of food. From the affordable appetizers to the large sashimi portions and moderate sized sushi rolls. super plus for not skimping on the sashimi slices. That's a big Nono! So they're a big yes yes!  -food tasted great.. Not melt in your mouth great but when all of the above is good, it definitely melts on the way down when it passes by your heart :) that's close enough for me. I mean hey, if the world were perfect, we all wouldn't be helping now would we.   My recommendation, try the sashimi and sushi combo for two, it was very satisfying for the 9 pieces of sashimi we got and the roll ( we got a rainbow roll that was good). We also ordered an extra fancy roll that was absolutely relish. For appetizers we got a seaweed salad and a spicy tuna ball. I can't ever see how anyone could go wrong with either of those selections!",

I ordered a sushi dish that revealed a string of hair underneath the sushi after I had already eaten a couple of bites. I sent it back. The waitress gave me a mealy, embarrassed apology. So against my better judgment I ordered a fried rice dish replacement but could not eat that because it was so smelly. The dish and the food smelled bad.  On top of all that the waitress still billed me for the sushi dish. I left that place and went elsewhere for a decent meal. This place does not take pride in food preparation and I was very concerned about food poisoning.  I would not recommend eating at this establishment at all. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",

You could tell he likes to guide people to what is fresh and delicious and he did that on this trip. The menu has every type of Asian food choices and sushi. He asked if he could bring us some sushi to start to earn our trust. He brought out white tiger roll which wasn't on the menu. Exquisite with shrimp, mango and white seaweed with a pair of sauces. Delicious. We also had the calamari which had a light tempura fry on it with Thai chili sauce, spot on. The bang bang shrimp was good but after that we just trusted our server with sushi choices. Next he asked us if we liked eel and we declined so he brought us out the Eptks roll minus the E for eel. Another night choice, smooth and creamy roll just melted in your mouth. After that we had a lobster tempura roll which was great with mango and then he brought a variety plate with a eye catching glowing blue  presentation which had white tuna sashimi  (best of the night) with red snapper and rainbow roll. With what looked like a slow Saturday night, I hope people find this place so we can keep going back. Thought the value was good with the plates he brought out averaging $2 per piece.",

    "text": "We went at 6:30 on a Wednesday and it was pretty dead.  That should have been the second warning sign.  The first warning sign should have been the menu, which includes crab cakes.  I have a rule that when an Asian places tries to do American dishes, neither are usually very good.  The third warning sign should have been that the servers were whiter than I am.  Another rule I have is to not eat at an Asian place without Asian servers.  It's almost never good.  Had I followed my rules, I wouldn't have experienced this place and would have been better off.  The starter was Inside Out Wonton dip which is essentially deconstructed Crab Rangoon.  It was good, and probably the best part of the meal.  My wife ordered a Thai Iced Tea and it was the worst I ever had.  There was a funny taste to it, maybe they used instant tea for it.  My wife had sweet sour chicken which again had a funny taste to it.  My wife doesn't like the sauce so she didn't try it.  It also came with some pineapple, carrot and bell pepper piled on top.  The pineapple was clearly canned, the peppers and carrots were not cooked properly and they were cut unevenly so the presentation was not great.  I had the walnut chicken, which was OK but certainly not worth 14 dollars.  It had a decent amount of shrimp and they were cooked properly.  There was a very small amount of walnuts, though.    Possibly the worst part of the meal was the sushi.  It was a tuna roll with tuna on top.  The tuna and avocado in the roll were OK but the tuna on top seemed like canned tuna.  It had an awful flavor.",

We started with the server recommended appetizer of King crab with avocado sushi rolls. I'm not a big fan of sushi yet, so this was perfect for me to build my taste for it. It had a spicy creamy sauce on top that added nice pop. The only drawback was the price. At $15 it was too much for an appetizer, but it did come with 10 large pieces. For the entree I had the spicy Thai Red Curry with chicken and white rice. The portion size was large for $11. Definitely will have a nice lunch tomorrow. Everything was fresh and presented well. It came out perfectly cooked and hot. I wasn't sure what to expect as most curry I've had is more of a stewy sauce. This was not like that at all. It was balanced with the chicken and vegetables. More of a glaze, mildly spicy and nuanced. Very good. My friend had the Sweet and Spicy Thai Mango. It looked so colorful on the plate and had a unique sweet flavor. Also very good with enough to take home for lunch. Overall a great new Asian place. Great for a chill night out with the girls or date night.",

Both were amazing and very flavorful with fresh ingredients. Even the small side of fried rice we ordered was memorable.

Really liked what they did to renovate from the Rib/BBQ place that was there prior.  As some have mentioned, the music was a little loud but the kids enjoyed the 80s hits.   We had the Dragon/ Phoenix, Sha-sha Beef, and chicken hibachi stir-fry to split for the kids. Overall it was average at best. There are so many things that Sky could improve and they are on the verge of being a nice venue. I really hope that they make improvements with them. Some of those being overly corn-starched sauces that make them too thick and gummy. The sauces seem like they are out of a can or bottle and not truly chef prepared. Also educate the servers to navigate first timers through the menu. Again, they just need to tweak a few items to really highlight this place.   On a side note, best thing we got was the side of Lo Main. Everyone loves the Lo Main!",

I ordered a sushi dish that revealed a string of hair underneath the sushi after I had already eaten a couple of bites. I sent it back. The waitress gave me a mealy, embarrassed apology. So against my better judgment I ordered a fried rice dish replacement but could not eat that because it was so smelly. The dish and the food smelled bad.  On top of all that the waitress still billed me for the sushi dish. I left that place and went elsewhere for a decent meal. This place does not take pride in food preparation and I was very concerned about food poisoning.  I would not recommend eating at this establishment at all. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",

    "text": "I am so beyond disappointed with my experience at this establishment. Great ambience, great decor, the sushi was OK and I was really excited about this $19 unlimited offer that they do which includes specialty rolls. But make sure you read the PARAGRAPH of disclaimers as any piece of sushi you don't eat will be charged a dollar extra onto your bill. So if you don't eat five pieces that's five extra bucks on your bill. What an absolutely insane policy. After this was pointed out to me when I finished and I told the waitress I was not going to pay that, the manager came over and also told me the same thing. I told her I was not going to pay that and that she was choosing not to take care of the situation. As I expected, two seconds later the amount was off of my bill. I hate when managers act like they can't to do something when they absolutely can. As icing on the cake when I was looking for a little understanding about how ridiculous this situation was and that I was going to be charged additional money and didn't realize it before I began my meal, the girl at the sushi bar proceeded to tell me how it was actually a reasonable deal and then walked off with an attitude. Was really hoping this was going to be my new sushi Spot but it's definitely not",

Our orders:  Bang Bang Shrimps, seaweed salad, edamame, shrimp shumai (stream dumplings), and curry stir noodle with shrimp and chicken.  My friend like her Bang Bang shrimps, she tries some of the shumai and liked it. I didn't.. It was just a big mush. Didn't taste like shrimp. Completely fall apart and very bland. The seaweed salad and the edamame are good and typical. My chicken and shrimp curry noodle is also bland. A giant big of noodles with very little shrimps, some chicken and some veggies.  The lady waitress, barely stops by.. My water was left empty for a long time. Mind you the place is empty. When she brought the bill. It was $36 and some change. I gave her $40 and tell her to bring back the changes so I can at least tip her a little more. She never came back. Totally disappear to the back. So I'm like, guess she only want $3 in tip. Not a place I will come back again!",

    "text": "Visited this establishment on 1/5/18 due to running across \"unlimited sushi and sliders\" on Groupon. This caught my attention as I have a massive appetite. The gist, for $20 a person, or $20 for a date with the Groupon, you get to choose from a very tasty and fresh assortment of everyday as well as special rolls very well prepared as well as deliciously deceiving sliders. You can also choose other items like potstickers, crab salad, and bang bang shrimp. The atmosphere is relaxed, food is fresh, price is fair, & overall this is a great place for yourself, a date night, or family outing. Definitely a recommendation. Just make sure you eat all the buns for the sliders or ask they serve the sliders without buns as the establishment does not want food wasted & will make you pay for it, which is only fair considering food costs money. Thanks for the experience.",

One of the specials today was a Fiesta Roll with tuna, cucumber, and fresh salsa topped with yellowtail and lime, so yummy! Service is always a touch slow, but I like to enjoy a cocktail and take my time so it doesn't bother me.",

I tried three rolls because of their Tuesday promotion of buy two rolls, get one free. Who doesn't love free?  I tried the crunchy salmon roll, a rainbow roll, and the crispy mango tuna roll. All three rolls were really good, but seriously, the mango tuna roll was outstanding. I was still thinking about it a day later. As its name implies, it had mango and tuna, but it also had spicy mayo and a slice of lime. So good! They also have a pretty decent bar list with several options for sake.",

I went in with high hopes and expectations due to the recommendation from friends and the high rating on Yelp.  The ambience was decent and the restaurant is open enough to not feel cramped. But, the service was subpar and the food was terrible. My girlfriend and I order a sashimi combination and a Korean beef BBQ (the beef was part of the restaurant week special). It took over an hour to get our food. By the time the food came to our table, the Korean beef is not sizzling anymore and it wasn't as hot as I expected. Not to mention the beef was extra salty, it was unbearable.  The combination of slow service and terrible food combined with pricing of a high-end restaurant making a second visit not worthwhile. I also forgot to mention that during the whole time I was there, the place was not busy (maybe half of the restaurant is filled).",

The place is located in the old Tony Roma's spot in Pineville,  They have a full bar as well as a sushi bar and two seating areas on either side of the restaurant.  '  The staff was really friendly and helpful.  We asked for recommendations and all of us went for recommended dishes - 3 of us went for the Royal Dish and another for the Basil Thai.  The Royal dish came out sizzling...think something on the lines of fajitas and consisted of proteins galore...tender beef, chicken, huge shrimp, and scallops along with veggies in a garlic sauce.  The sauce was a little spicy but the whole dish was very good and was worth the $14 price.  The only downside is most of us were not impressed with the scallops.  Ok, you're allowed one flaw...but just one.  The service was good but they were not busy.  Honestly, I think this is a bad location for a restaurant.  I think it's the reason the last place closed.  Unless you are taking the back way to/from the Centrum shopping center, there's really no way you would see it from Highway 51.  But still, I am planning to come back here with the dinner group for dinner in May.  Hopefully they will be busier then.",

That said, it has good background music and a pleasant feel.  The service is very good.  The food was so-so.  I enjoyed the crab rangoon dip, but the calamari was more French fry-ish than I'm used to.  My kung pao shrimp was well flavored with just a bit of heat.  My boyfriend didn't particularly like his sushi.    Big selling point - there were 3$ draft beers!",

So we drove here at the height of rush hour traffic but easily found a parking space. We were quickly seated and I ordered a mess of sushi nigiri and two salmon based rolls. My wife is having pot stickers and sesame chicken.  The rolls that I chose weren't anything special and by that I mean that they were average tasting at best. No outstanding flavors. The sushi nigiri was average as well. The uni in particular looked dried out but still was moist and tasty. The salmon didn't have any flavor which was very odd. I think I had the salmon lovers roll and the Alaska roll.   I think that to get the real low down on these rolls that I'll have to leave my wife at home. I really wanted to try the wagyu roll and the j bomb roll. Some of the other spicy rolls looked interesting but being limited to what a coupon could purchase was annoying. I'll need to get up with my sushi buddy and try again.",

They are very accommodating when it comes to gluten allergy.  The draw back however is that service can suffer from time to time. As you will end up waiting to put your order in or get a drink. From my observations it is possible that our server last night had one too many tables. Once our server was caught up...Service was great!",

    "text": "My husband and I always like trying different places to eat when we travel.  This restaurant was not the one we originally planned to go to, but it ended up as a second choice.  We had started out for a German restaurant that had been recommended for us to try.  We weren't familiar with the area and as we were driving to the directions given by GPS, we came upon a closed road due to bridge being out.  We had missed the detour signs and ended up at Sky instead.    It wasn't crowded and we were hungry.  I ordered sesame chicken and hubby got a shrimp/ scallop dish.   The food was very good and freshly made.   I ordered a cocktail that sounded better than it was.  It was all right, but not worth the $8.99 cost.  Our server was attentive and friendly.    The main thing that spoiled our experience was that we were seated next to a table of four teenage girls who lacked table manners and general courtesy.  We would have asked for a different table but none were available.  So we and other diners around us got to hear giggles, the  sharing of food being tossed in to each other's mouths, selfies, and of course, verses from various pop songs being sung louder than necessary.  I felt bad for the server as she was trying to keep everyone happy in spite of this squad of Taylor Swift wanna-bees.   The thing that dumbfounded me was learning the parent of one of the girls was at the restaurant, but she was seated clear across the room away from them.   Momma had her laptop open at a table and was supposedly working.  My husband said she was probably on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMatch.com&s=811cc30022d77156f869d2477f68d5823aaf9b46b799319ab032f2da80256579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Match.com</a>.   Momma never came to their table or asked her daughter and friends to be a little more considerate of others.  Their behavior was \"acceptable.\"  Why would she? They weren't right beside her.     My husband and I thought about asking management to do something, but it seemed they were familiar with this group.  Best to just eat fast and leave.   So I doubt that we will return here on our next visit to the area.",

Looks like the entire staff is new. Maybe about 10 patrons on the whole place and a table sat dirty for 10-15 mins before it was cleaned. My husband finished his AUCE sushi and she never came over to ask what he needed for his next order. I see there doing remodeling in the next few days, hopefully the old staff will come back, all of the Ladies from our previous visits were AWESOME.",

First impression, they seem to not have been opened long but has no bearing on the service they provided. From the moment we walked in, they service was impeccable and personable which is always pleasurable. They also were running a special that if you checked in on Facebook, you received 10%. Okay to the food. I ordered the Carolina Panthers sushi roll and I had the Singapore Rice Noodles with Shrimp and it was plenty and yummy. My best friend ordered the Salmon and Broccoli, my godson had the shrimp and broccoli and her nephew (2 years old) had the chicken tenders and fries. All plates were generous and plentiful and there's something for everyone. Wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in town!",

The miso soup is good. I really liked their seaweed salad too. All of the sushi was fresh and made to order. They even offer specialty rolls such as the volcano roll. The sliders are quite good as well. The only complaint I have about them is the buns are too big for the size of the meat patty. Be careful how much you order as you are expected to eat everything or they may charge you for it. I can appreciate that as I see people wasting way too much food at buffets.   This place is very classy inside especially for an Asian restaurant. The bar is very unique as it has a skylight. The service is fast and friendly.",

However, they're too small and the wait times are long. Plus, their sushi has been pretty crappy lately so I wanted to look for a new place.  I found this place that's not too far from Mr. Tokyo and it's the same price. The restaurant is much much bigger and the decor is very pretty. Very clean place. Our waitress is very sweet as well. Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious. I got one of the sliders with tater tots, french fries, chicken wings, sweet potato roll, California roll, and the bang bang shrimp. Each dish was perfect and we ate everything. I also like the random addition of sliders, cole slaw, tater tots, chips, and chicken wings. Makes it stand out from the other places.   I highly recommend this place over Mr. Tokyo. This is now my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I'm never going back to Mr. Tokyo after this.",

This place use to be a Tony Romas (if you folks remember that chain!), but is now an asian fusion restaurant and has been open since November 2013.  This is our 2nd time here and both times have been good experiences.  The restaurant interior is nice and the lighting makes it a bit dark (4/5).  The seating seems a bit odd as there is a table in the center and booths around which seems like you are being watched.  I normally prefer table than booths but opted for the booth because of this.  The service was great (5/5) and the waitress could answer questions we had about the pad thai. The food was very good (4/5), and we had the pad thai, general tso chicken,  eel roll and seaweed salad,  and seafood miso ramen soup. Portions are large as well.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.",

Sky has redeemed themselves!   Absolutely a horrible experience. We ate at Sky on a Friday night and there were only 2 other tables. This should of been our sign. We sit down and order our drinks as well as appetizers at the same time. 15 minutes later our appetizers come out and still no drinks. At this point we are a bit annoyed. Next, the food comes out along with the salads and soups we ordered which should of came out prior to our entrees. When our meal was over our waiter asked to high five everyone at our table. Completely unprofessional and not wanted. Lastly one of the couples at our table had a coupon of which had to be scanned from her phone so the waiter took her phone to the computer to do so. He comes back 10 minutes later and forgets her phone. The service was the worst I have ever experienced. I will NEVER be back and I will tell everyone I know to not waste their time.",

They are all good of course, but this new place was worth at least a try. It isn't IN Ballantyne, but nearby in Pineville, but I have to say, the short drive was worth it. I went with my sushi loving teenage daughter on a Saturday night around 8pm. The parking lot and the place was fairly empty, so I was worried at first, but it is down on the right across from the mall, with only a hotel there behind it, so as for location and visibility, this place needs to do some more serious marketing like they did for their grand opening when they had a billboard on I-485 and other advertising and stay consistent with it because its semi hidden location could become its downfall. Overall, the decor is nice, we sat at the sushi bar, there was only one other couple seated there. Service was good and the staff friendly. The sushi is fresh and professionally prepared by obviously experienced sushi chefs. One recommended the Tuna Cube, which had a limited description but we went ahead with it and it was awesome! It really isn't a \"cube\" but 6 pieces of bite size sushi (not rolled). We also ordered a Bombay Roll which is spicy crunchy tuna topped with eel, avocado & fish roe (excellent!), a Volcano Roll which is salmon, tuna & yellowtail fried, topped w/roe, scallions & special sauce (also excellent!) and finally, The Sky Roll, tuna, avocado, spicy mayo & crunchy topped w/shrimp, tuna & salmon. We found this roll to be a tad clunky, maybe because of the thick cut of the pieces, they had recommended the  EBTKS Roll that has tuna, salmon, eel, yellowtail, lobster salad, and tempura flakes with the chef's special dressing but we had ordered the Sky Roll instead. We will definitely go with the EBTKS Roll instead on our next trip. The owner and his partner spoke with us for a few minutes, they were very nice, and indicated the location was problematic. Apparently they have a Lake Norman restaurant together as well but it isn't name Sky I don't believe. I sure hope they figure out a solution for the location issue quickly, it is a good asian fusion place worthy of your time and $$!  Definitely go and eat there!",

My family and I have been to this restaurant twice, and it is a refreshing alternative to the chain restaurants in the Carolina Place Mall area.  It sits right behind the Vitamin Shoppe.  The first time we went it was very busy (right after a groupon offering) and we were seated in a comfortable area to wait and were frequently checked on and offered drinks.  We could preview the dinner and bar menu.  They have many other Asian menu choices besides sushi.  I have ordered the Lettuce Wraps twice.  It is an appetizer but big enough for a meal for me, especially after the huge Crab Rangoon dip app. The sushi is very fresh and large in size.  There are also some \"western\" dishes for your picky friends.  Definitely plan to eat there soon if you like Asian food.",

They even boxed the meals for us at the end.   The food was solid, we had a sampling of sushi, chinese and the singapore curry noodles.  Prices were reasonable for what you got and Kirin pint draft priced right as well.  We tried this because of a groupon but will be back.

The sushi was very mediocre.. It lacked in flavor.  The food I'm general was a little pricey for such mediocre food.  I was really disappointed.

    "text": "I purchased the Groupon in hopes of finding a new \"go-to\" for asian food.  The reviews were mixed, but mostly positive so I felt confident enough to try.    We went on a Wednesday evening.  The first thing we both noticed was how dark the front parking lot is, and how uneasy that made us feel.  It's dark and foreboding and makes it seem much more like a nightclub than a restaurant.  It also sits behind other buildings and off the main road so lighting is very necessary yet noticeably absent.    We walk in and it's lovely.  The interior is pretty, though not at all \"asian\".  It looks much more \"cajun\" or \"beachy\" with the big bar at the entrance and all the plank wood floors and crisp white shuttered windows.  The flow of the interior was odd; again no feng shui like you'd expect from an \"asian\" inspired establishment.  Over the bar is a huge well lit gilded framed mermaid.?.  It's an interesting piece- but how exactly does that tie in to the bar inside an asian restaurant.  It was clean and inviting, but nothing made any sense or flowed together as you'd expect.  There was 1 table full of ladies near the door and 4 or 5 people at the bar and us.  That was it.  There were more employees than customers and the employees were not in any hurry to do anything.  Some even sat in chairs and just watched tv.  Our waiter (Joey) was the typical snarky, petulant, little gay server guy.  The type that thinks it's humorous to say a quick \"no.\" whenever you ask for anything and then laugh as if he's so witty.  I don't find that witty at all.  I didn't enjoy that when I was in junior high school and I certainly don't enjoy paying for it as an adult.  Joey left a lot to be desired.  He was slow and prickly at best.  If he's the best Sky has to offer, then they're really in trouble.    Ok- so finally to the food.  We ordered the Inside Out Wonton dip for $9.  The first thing Joey said was \"do you like cream cheese?\"  I thought that was a negative comment to make and made us feel like maybe we'd chosen poorly.  How exactly does a comment like that help anyone?  It doesn't help me the customer feel confident in spending my $9 and it doesn't help Sky make a sale.  When the appetizer arrives, it's in a bowl along side a basket of fried wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over them.?.  It was little broken pieces of wet sticky cold fried wontons that I'm supposed to be able to dip into hot, thick lobster dip??  The dip was good, but we had no real way of transporting it to our mouths because the little broken wonton strips kept breaking in the thick dip.  We even asked for more strips that were big enough to use, but by the time Joey brought them the dip was cold and no longer appetizing so no- I would not at all recommend the Inside Out Wonton Dip for $9.   We were trying to get a base idea of the food so we ordered basic dishes that should be a good representation of their skills.  I ordered the Sky Stir Fry with chicken for $12 and my fella ordered beef and broccoli for $12.  Both dishes looked beautiful when they arrived, but both dishes only tasted so-so.  They also don't bother to tell you that only the white rice is free and that you pay an additional $1 for fried or brown rice.  (I expect to be advised of upcharges either on the menu itself or by my server - neither of those happened)  Our sweet teas were $2 each, which I always think is too high for tea.   So in conclusion:  the inside of the building was pretty.  The service was slow and annoying.  The food is alright, but not amazing.  It's simply over priced for the experience you're getting.  I seriously doubt we'll go back.  Pei Wei outdoes this place hands down for half of the price.",

I will say however, that the service is slow. The servers don't talk very much and aren't the friendliest people in the world. However, my drinks always stay filled to the rim which I always find to be a major plus..  One time I went here for dinner with my fiance, and my server disappeared for about 15 mins. Although the other girl came by to ask if everything was ok, I was disturbed when our server came back smelling like pure cigarette smoke. . which is very unappetizing and unprofessional in my opinion.",

The rice was dry and needed more rice vinegar. The fresh is not as fresh as most places. Overall, it's okay. I would go back and try their stir fry.",

We waited for 20 minutes to be seated while the entire waitstaff stared at us through the back kitchen (it was 12 on a Tuesday - they were absolutley open).  Once we got seated our waiter (male) - came over and did not crack a smile or speak a word. It was almost humorous. I think he grunted to take our order. It is understandable if his english was bad - but he was speaking english to the other waiter when he was away from our table. It was strange.  On top of all of that the food was bad. No taste - bland - blah!  This place will be gone in no time - when your service and food is bad - there is no hope!",

This has quickly become our \"go to\" sushi spot and in my opinion has some of the freshest sushi in Charlotte.  Our favorite night is Tuesday sushi night when you can buy two rolls and get a third for free - great deal!    Overall the staff are very friendly, the decor is very nice, and service has been good.  However the sushi is definitely what keeps us coming back!",

    "text": "I've gone here three times so far since they opened up so that's a good sign. I LOVE their general tso chicken. It's super crispy, well cook and have the right level of spice to it. My sister and daughter LOVES their walnut shrimp. We are Asian foodie and we know how hard it is to find delicious general tso chicken and walnut shrimp so this place has us wanting to come back for more! The sushi is not great, but its not bad also. I also LOVE the interior decor. They did a great job on this place. I use to go here when it was Tony Roma's and you could tell the big difference.  Now the Cons is that the outside exterior needs some rework! There's nothing exciting about how the place looks like from the outside and that might be what is not attracting a lot of service. They have ONE waiter that is working most of the time and he is not very friendly looking. He speaks broken English, seems rude most of the time and likes to rush you when ordering and eating. The bathroom also has this bad smell to it. (This was one of the reasons why I stop going to Tony Romas) and it seems that the smell has not gone away. You almost have to hold your breath when you are in the bathroom. I think there's something wrong with the sewage system.   But overall this place is worth a try!!! Don't let the negative affect you, the positive is that the food is good! :)",

    "text": "Saw a Groupon for this brand new sushi joint near Carolina Place mall. Seeing as I'm a sushi nut, I had to give it a try. It's a little off the road, but the sign on the building is noticeable.  It has the best atmosphere of any sushi place I've been to - classy, comfortable, spacious, not loud. Very unique. Our server was friendly and attentive but a little jumbled, but we could tell she was just new. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, but I figured that's probably because they haven't been open long.  On to the food. My partner and I ordered a Sky Roll and a Rainbow Roll. They came out pretty quickly. The fish on my Sky Roll was so fresh it literally melted in my mouth, and even the avocado was tasty. The fish on his Rainbow Roll didn't look as fresh, but he said it was still good. Beautiful presentation too (wish I had taken a picture). I got miso soup as a side - the tofu actually tasted like soy, which was refreshing, but the broth was a little too salty for my palate. Not bad though. The boyfriend got a side of steamed vegetables, which were honestly delicious and probably the freshest steamed veggies I've ever had at a restaurant. If they were frozen, coulda fooled me.  They also have a unique sake list (and hot house sake if you ask for it). I picked up some cold unfiltered TyKu coconut sake, and I TOTALLY recommend it. Like alcoholic coconut milk - yum!  Overall, cool, classy atmosphere and fresh, tasty food. Recommended for anyone looking to hit a new sushi spot. Don't let this one go out of business - it's a keeper!",

Update: the restaurant would not honor my living-social prepaid voucher. We were in a large group (paying individually) and apparently one of my coworkers also wanted to use a prepaid voucher as well.   The manager strictly enforced the one prepaid voucher per table. They said if we had sat at the bar, this would not have been an issue, but since we were at a table, it was a different case altogether, and they would enforce the policy.",
