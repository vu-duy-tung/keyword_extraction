    "text": "I decided to give this place one last try. Alas, I will not go back. Ever. The owner's attitude was worse than ever. My friend and I were so nice to her and she was just cold and rude. She acted like we were bothering her. I keep reading reviews about her being so nice. She *used* to be nice years ago. Now she can't even crack a smile and it honestly looks like she *hates* being there. I'm sorry you hate your job so much but it's not your customers' fault!   I ordered my usual chicken gang massaman 4 star spicy level. I could drink that sauce it's SO DARN GOOD. The chicken is almost always overcooked, though. When I placed my order I politely asked the server to ask the cook to not overcook my chicken. Sure enough, it was overcooked. I should have sent it back but I didn't. That's no one's fault by my own but to be honest I was afraid the owner would get mad at me. :-(   The straw that broke the camel's back yesterday was the ever so inefficient way of paying the check. I have no idea why the owner can't follow the same systems other restaurants do. I have always been annoyed by this whenever I've gone. Instead of giving you a check with what you ordered, the price of each item, the tax and the total, they just write down what you ordered. That's it. It's not even written out; it's the number such as L18.  You have to stand in line and the owner rings you up. So if you have three people on one check, you all have to stand in line. This is terribly inefficient at lunch. There will be 10 people standing in line and people will be waiting to be seated. It's all one big mess.   I fear that the servers do not get their tips. It's a little hard to explain why I feel that way but the owner has complete control over the checks and the money and it's just little things I've observed here and there that lead me to think that.  I make it a point to leave cash on the table for a tip so that the server can take it as opposed to leaving the tip on my credit card when I pay my bill. I have a strong feeling that the owner pockets most of the tips left on credit cards. When I've put tips on credit cards in the past, I see her placing a little bit of money in the tip jar but it's not what's actually given as a tip. I VERY much hope I'm wrong about this. Someone please prove me wrong.  I can only imagine what a horrible place it is to work because the wait staff is terribly overworked and I doubt she treats them better than she does her customers!   If I could rate the soup, spring roll and gang massaman sauce by themselves I'd give them five stars. The service gets zero stars. I'd give the chicken three stars and Pad Thai two stars.",

For my entree I had the red curry with tofu, it's very well seasoned. I asked for it medium hot and that was actually hot for me, so just be careful ordering how hot you want it. Overall it's a good place to try out!",

Charlene had the pad ki mau with beef and I tried something new - red curry fried rice. We both like spicier than locals and I was happy to hear they had a \"thai\" scale in addition to the local hot scale - which only went to 4 but the thai scale went to 8. Char had a 3 on the thai scale, I had 6 and we were both happy. Loved the food! Kristin was very attentive and although the place was empty when we got there, being late Sunday, a total of 8 more people came in after 9. We will definitely come back.",

I order a bunch of food for a few people since we always eat family style. And again taking home the food the flavor was all off. The wings was fried in old oil and probably refried several times bc it was dry and black. Idk how they would even allow for that to get packed to be sent off for anyone to eat. And the most disgusting part of it is the peanut sauce that goes with summer rolls had mold in it, I dipped the roll in it and noticed the mold right as I was taking a bite of the roll. I never been so infuriated with a restaurant in my life and I have been in the business for 10 years! It's an insult to all restauranteurs to serve shit like that.",

    "text": "This place is rather like Chinese delivery but Thai. That being said it's not a bad place to get delivery and I've been obsessed with them the last two weeks. The Num Tok Beef Salad is probably my favorite thing they do here. I could eat it twice a week every week and be a happy camper for sure!! I've also tried their Pad Si Ewe which to be honest was only okay. Their noodles weren't very good. Everything else about the dish was fine, but the noodles tasted stale/cooked wrong. I've also had the Larb Kai salad which was delicious and their spring rolls which were good. That is as far as I've gotten on their menu because well Beef salad :D. I did order with them through Yelp and that experience was ehhh okay and the delivery cost is insane considering how close I live to Siam Garden. However I ordered from them through Take Home Delivery and the delivery cost was much more affordable and I had a good experience with them. One big bonus of this place is that they will give you the spice level you ask for (truly adhere to the spice level charts). Usually if I go to places and ask for Thai hot or order a traditionally REALLY hot dish they look at me funny and give me a dumbed down version. At Siam Garden if you ask for hot it's pretty much what they give you for Thai hot anywhere else. Overall super happy with this place as a good 'fast food' type Thai place.",

I asked for a recommendation by the greater and got the green curry it fed myself and 2 other co-workers there was so much and it was that lovely amount of heat to make you sweat but not so hot I couldn't enjoy it. I liked it so much I went back the next day and made my fiance who hates curry try it and he loved it too!",

    "text": "Siam Garden - I have seen your coupons in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay quarterly for years.  I have seen you when traffic forces me to take a backroad detour to work.  I never met you until today.  Siam Garden appears to be a very clean restaurant.  A 98 sanitation grade and ServSafe certification are displayed up entering.  The tables are decorated nicely with plates, bowls and napkins.  What is a little odd that despite how pristine it is, boxes are visible and the counter, complete with soda cans and 5 hour energy drinks, could pass for a market in Manhattan.  This is mostly for the University of Phoenix offline students of course since the campus is close.  I'm no expert on Thai food for sure.  I've had pad thai a few times, but I don't know what authentic pad thai is.  I have two friends who've lived in Thailand, so I'll ask them.  However, I know what tastes good, and the pad thai here tastes better than the others I've had.  Our service was prompt and quick, but it was a late 8pm dinner so there was only one other table of 4 guys originally from India. My wife had the tofu fried rice and I tried it too - it was very good.  Tofu is difficult to cook so that's it not mushy, but they did.  Sodas were served in cans at $3 a pop which is a little high.  However, with the coupon, which added 18% gratuity as stated, we still had a reasonably priced meal.  For the days we want something other than Chinese food, we will hit this place up.  Though there isn't much around it, it's easy to get to from Steele Creek, Fort Mill, and is right off of 485 at exit 3, making it convenient to even more people.",

She always picks on me about how much sweet tea I drink :).  Speaking of tea, the sweet tea and jasmine tea are some of the best you can get!  Lunch always comes with a free cup of soup which is always different and delicious.  I do eat dinner here on occassion as I did tonight but mostly I am there for lunch.  I usually get the Pad Thai or the Red Curry.  The Red Curry is excellent and comes with a side of white rice.  It's honestly some of the best Red Curry I have ever had and beats Monsoon on South Blvd hands down.  The Pad Thai is great too and I usually order it with extra chicken and with 1 star (stars = heat index).  I also highly suggest the Thom Kha soup as it is similar to the Red Curry.   The free soup usually comes out pretty fast and the refills on drinks are pretty quick too.  Although sometimes they do get a little bogged down during lunch.  All in all this is a great place to eat if you like Red Curry and Pad Thai.  It's worth the trip to just hang out and talk to the owner!",

I know the gooeyness  means they overcooked his noodles. Lets not even talk about my pad kee mao. It was probably hands down the worst i've ever tasted in my life. They should be ashamed of putting their name on it. All it tasted like was wide rice noodles doused in siracha sauce. It's shameful to even call it pad kee mao and should call it siracha noodles.

    "text": "Worst Thai restaurant and maybe even the worst restaurant I have ever been to. This is not an exaggeration. Not only was the food inedible, but the hostess who is also the owner was really rude and refused to serve us. As soon as we sat down, she asked \"What you want?\" My friend and I were not ready to order and asked for a few minutes. She rolled her eyes at us and left. She never came back and one of the girls working in the kitchen had to come out to help us with our orders. We ordered 3 dishes: the Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, and the Chicken Larb. The Pad Thai was soooooo overly sweet with no peanut flavor at all and tasted nothing like Pad Thais I've had at other Thai restaurants. I couldn't even eat it at all and had to ask for extra peanut sauce. Even after adjusting for the nasty taste of the Pad Thai, the food was still inedible. My friend said his Massaman Curry was the worst he had ever had. The Chicken Larb was disgusting. Not only was the chicken overcooked but tasted like someone had simply just squeezed a dozen limes and put a ***load of cilantro onto it. That was all I could taste. Nevertheless, this was one of the worst eating out experiences I've had in my life. We went to the restaurant over 2 months ago, and I still recall all the details of the horrible service and disgusting food because it was just that terrible.  One Additional Note: The manager/owner/hostess was really nice to a couple of people who came in and was hugging them and talking to them nonstop. I am not sure how she formed these alliances, but the entire time she was sitting with her regulars, no one came over to take our orders. She was just one table behind us and could clearly see we had not been served.",

The pad thai wasn't as terrible as the one at Thai House (near Ballantyne), but it was still not good. The texture of the noodles wasn't good, it was too saucy, and I didn't like the flavor. PLUS, they added peanuts when I said NO PEANUTS!  I guess I would be open to trying the curry, but I'm pushing this one down to a 1 star for now.  P.S. fortunately there was no line here today, but why is there usually a line at this place?!",

    "text": "Color me happy, Siam Garden is a great little find.  It is way down on Whitehall Park Dr. in a business park.  It's so odd, you think to yourself, there is going to be a Thai restaurant down this road.  Amazing, on the outside it is very nondescript shopping strip mall, but when you walk in the door it is decorated like an ornate Thai restaurant, complete with gold headdresses with signs that read: Do Not Touch Headdress.  The lunch menu is basic, a couple of curries,noodle and rice dishes, Come to think of it, I don't think I have ever been to a Thai restaurant where the menu is different, they are always the same, no matter what city.  Lunch specials offer a spring roll and bowl of soup.  We ordered red curry and pad thai and ordered them hot, spicy, 3 out of 5.  They were perfect.  It was the hottest food I think I have had.  You know the heat that is so hot, you can't wait to get the next bite in your mouth to get the rush again.  But not too hot where all you get is the heat.  Very yummy. I am thinking, I might not want to eat Thai food anywhere else in CLT.  Service was really good too.  Quick and friendly.  I can't wait to go back with a group of people so I can try some more menu items.  I want to have a dinner party celebration and see if they will let me wear the headdress.",

    "text": "Always on the look-out for the next great Thai place...  When a couple friends suggested we get Thai and head to this place I was definitely game and quite pleasantly surprised.  This restaurant sits in the middle of the Whitehall office park.  I'm sure it probably gets most of its traffic during the week at lunch times, but coming here Sunday night... the place was pretty empty.  I was a little skeptical riding down the road since it is pretty far away (if you are coming off of S. Tryon).  We later figured out it was seconds away from the 485/Arrowood Rd exit.  Now the most important part:  the food was delicious!  It was actually refreshing to see more options than the usual Thai chains that have their pad thais and currys.  We all started out with a curry puff appetizer which was gone in 10seconds.  I ordered a Tom Yum soup since I was starving at this point in the day and I had run something crazy [9 miles] in the morning.  The Yellow curry with chicken at \"hot\" level was pretty darn perfect for me.  I liked how the heat slowly built up and was not too mild and not too blazingly hot.  The rice to curry ratio was perfect.  Our greeter/server/ (and maybe cook?)  [Hopefully she had more help in the kitchen that I didn't see]  Was super charming and personable.  She recognized me as a newbie and asked me where I lived.  I told her, \"Matthews\" with a sad expression since it was kind of a drive to get here.  She did say that she has regulars that drive in from Waxhaw....  Despite the location, I definitely will keep this one on my list.  It is currently at the top for Thai at the moment (until I find something equally as delicious and charming near Matthews).",

I heard a couple of women talking in the back.  I could see one of them look through the window in the door of the kitchen and was sure she must have seen me plus the front door beeps when it's opened.  I stood there for probably 5 minutes but no one came out to greet me or anything. Looking over the dinner prices on the menu by the counter, it seemed like a bit more than I wanted to pay anyhow.  I probably would have ordered something anyway if they came out of the kitchen but since they didn't I ended up walking out empty handed. I've heard the food is good but sadly I'll probably never find out for myself.  Leaving a customer standing in an empty dining room for 5 minutes without greeting them is horrible customer service.",

Then we waited 10 minutes for menus and utensils.  We ordered.  I ordered no rice but my dish came with it anyway.    The food was ok this time.  The vegetables were barely cooked and a slice of carrot was actually raw.  The dish didn't even look appetizing.  I don't know what to say about the service.  When I said thank you after they filled up my water glass, all I heard was a grunt.  Yes, a grunt.  I'd expect that if I were in a biker bar but not a Thai restaurant.

The restaurant is in a strip mall in a business park off Arrowwood just past 485.  The place wasn't busy, just a couple of tables when I stopped in.  The decor was pretty typical for an asian restaurant.  It looked clean and well maintained.  When ever I have Thai food I pretty much always order Pad Thai, which is what I did today.  My meal came with soup and a fried spring roll.  The soup was interesting with chunks of pineaple in it along with some ground meat. (beef?)  Whatever it was the broth was light and tasted good.  My main dish came out pretty quickly after I finished my soup.  The spring roll was kind of small, but it really was just an added bonus as I didn't expect to get it.  The Pad Thai was tasty and hot.  I'm not much of an expert on Thai food, but like art, I know what I like and this was pretty good.  I'm pretty sure the person serving me was the owner of the restaurant.  My service was OK, but it seemed like she was more interested in the regulars at the other tables.  She did chat with me a bit when she brought my check though.  The price was very reasonable at $7.95 for my lunch.   I would recommend giving this place a try.",

The curry had an excellent flavor, and it was nice to get spring rolls where you could actually taste the filling and not receive an overload of fried wrapper. Dessert options were limited, but we don't often get dessert anyway. The lady running the restaurant was very nice, definitely a family ran business. Wife and I were happy to find a decent Thai restaurant in Steele Creek.",

Seem like a good place to settle down and take a breather after a long day at work.. The waitress was tentative. She didn't rush us to order. But I ordered the yellow curry with chicken . It has potatoes and onions. The portion was big enough for 2 ppl or 2 meals if you decided to take it home. Very very tasty.. I ordered mild version but still spicy for me. But I'm the type that can't handle spicy at all. Then I finish my meal with the mango with sticky rice topped with coconut sauce. Now it's sooo good I can't stop thinking about it since. I wonder if they just deliver that. Or how many do I have to order for them to deliver.. That's how good it is., overall I know now to not come during lunch. It is crazy busy during that time and the food doesn't seem as good. But dinner time a good time to be there!",

It was a rich, clear broth with carrots, cabbage, onions, and chunks of tofu.  The taste was complex and hearty despite the soups delicate appearance.  I'll come back for this soup when the weather gets cold for sure  :-)  The location was kind of odd, but the area is still growing up around it.  The ambiance was relaxing, the servers weren't particularly engaging, but they got the job done.  There was too much \"decor\" consisting of old faded pictures, golden deity items and curio cabinets filled with tiny boxes or tea sets.  Then when I got to the register, I noticed all the orchids lined up on the counter.  They're pretty, but wow- there's too many of them in the way.  Then my eyes fell to the make shift table made out of beer cases and menu boxes stacked beside the register and in front of the beer cooler.  This was puzzling.  Overall I'd have to say that the entire dining area was decorated by a loving grandmother type that kept all the school photos and every art project - LOL  It wasn't dirty or alarming in any way, but it's noticeably cluttered.  I'm not saying clutter is bad, but I will say it doesn't do much to build confidence for patrons.  I would definitely go again, and I do recommend it if you're in the area  :-)",

    "text": "I wish I could give a half a star. We were in the area, and usually go to China Town or Fortune Cookie, but thought we'd order a very small to go order to give Siam Garden a try - just spring rolls and pad thai - rude order taker, unthankful and slow to start, I asked a question or 2 about the menu, and she treated me like I was not welcome to ask questions - only one party was in the restaurant, and it was in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday, so it should not have been a big deal, we waited and waited and waited some more, more than 20 minutes, no one said a word, no acknowledgment that it would be ready soon, sorry its taking a long time, nothing, like we did not exist. The rude older lady then I guess went on break, another younger lady then came to the front. A couple other guys that came in about 10 minutes after us then were given their to go order and they got in their car to leave. They were missing a bunch of their food so it had to be rushed out to their car as they were leaving the parking lot. I asked the younger lady if somehow maybe our food was possibly sitting in the back already done for us, and she was snippy, and said that was impossible, she had just been back there. About 5 more minutes passed and the older lady then came out with a bag of food, and we checked it, and it was not even close to being ours, it actually ended up being the poor guys that had already left. We finally were given our spring rolls and pad thai - not a word about, sorry it took so long, or anything about the mix ups - just handed to us, no, thank you, no nothing. Got home to marginal spring rolls, smallish, and tasted like the frozen ones you get at Harris Teeter, with cheap and very sparse sauce to dip them in, like they possibly had taken the little plastic duck sauce and put it into plastic containers to make it look like they actually made it. We shared the noodles between about 4 of us - 2 of us ate the noodles, and the other 2 ate about 3-4 bites and I threw out the rest - one half a star for food, a quarter of one star for service. Next time I want food and service better than Siam Garden, I will grab egg rolls from QT, wait, I actually am OK with QT egg rolls, that is an unfair comparison, and if QT starts making asian noodles, I am sure they will be fantastic, in comparison.",

It was really good and huge portion! It had good spice and creamy from the coconut. Yum and have become a fan. My husband got a noodle dish and it was really good too. I think pad Thai just isn't their specialty but get the curry!  I'm adding to my review I still love their yellow curry but the service is just horrible eating in or taking carry out. It's slow even when it's not busy there. I ordered to go and they told me 30 mins I ended up waiting another 25 mins when I arrived... An Hr wait is just not acceptable to me. If I didn't like their curry so much I would gave them a 1",

I had to have some Thai and I realllly wanted Basil but this was literally the only Thai restaurant in our vicinity open at 3:30 on a weekday. When we got there we were the only customers. Little old lady guides us to a table, sets down two menus and walks away. Ooooo...kay.  She didn't come back to get drink orders until we were ready to order our food. We ordered crab rangoon as a starter (it was really good and made with real crab) I ordered the shrimp pad thai, extra hot. It was great! The bf ordered honey chicken...it tasted ok. But then the unthinkable happened - he discovered a little DEAD FLY in the chicken. He told the server, she apologized and went to throw it away. I was grossed out--but my pad thai was delicious I kept right on eating, but not without first scrutinizing every bite that went in my mouth. All good. The lady brought him out a fresh new plate of chicken about 5 minutes later.  All in all, minus the dead fly it was ok. The authentic Thai decor was really beautiful to look at, but I think I will wait until Basil is open before going here again.",

If you like spice, Siam has it. The only thing I will say is that, most times I order a level 2 spice and it's really hit or miss. Some days it tastes like I got a level 4/5, some days it's a 2 and others a 1. I did notice if I add modifications to my meal, it's exactly the spice that I ordered (i.e. no peanuts, extra scallions for pad thai or no basil or bamboo shoots for the curry). It's perfect. So maybe if they get multiple orders of the same thing, it all gets cooked together. Needless to say, I will revisit as it's convenient and pretty good. Love the red curry!!",

Its in the Whitehall Commons Business center, so I'm assuming thats why its overpriced.   About the service, I went in around 8pm on a Monday. The server was not welcoming. Real standoffish. No smile but not rude. Good was done in 10 minutes for takeout.   The food was okay, not bad but not anything I would return to eat or recommend to anyone. It did however have the right amount of spicy. The noodles were a bit over cooked and the chicken was scarce. For 9.94 it wasn't anything to rave about.",

I noted that another table, that came in after us, was served first. Additionally, I don't think anyone came to check on us after the food came. One of my lunch mates had to hunt down a carry out container for me. I would order from Siam again, but I would totally get take out.",

Slow service and waitress wasn't very engaging nor did she check back on drink refill. Wouldn't mind going back, but definitely not during busier times.  As for the food, I felt the soup portion that came with my food was smaller than the one you get at Thai Taste. I got Pineapple Curry Fried Rice with chicken for my entree. It was my first time eating curry and I didn't care for it. Monsoon has a similar dish without the curry. Perhaps I'll trying something different next time or see if they can leave it out.",

Ordered some spring rolls and satay to start, they were alright, some of the flavors were a little lighter than I've come to expect from similar places. Their peanut sauce was a little meal-y with the satay, but seemed fresh. Make sure to specify if you want the meat spring rolls otherwise they'll default to vegetarian.   We also ordered noodle soup (their iteration very close to pho), the Panang curry, and their pad kee mao. Other reviews point out that their noodle dishes are not their strong suit, and I would strongly agree; the pad kee mao was instead a sriracha noodle dish. Would definitely opt towards getting their curries or anything that is not their noodle dishes.",

That said, the lunch specials offer great prices and good sized portions of amazing food.   They will customize any dish for you by adding vegetables or taking things away. They can also legitimately make it super hot, which a lot of places won't do these days. I've tried multiple things on the menu, and everything is cooked to perfection, you can almost feel the love!

I wouldn't recommend the wings. The crab ragoon lacked flavor too and was over cooked. The pad thai was a little dry and had a weird taste. The red curry tasted better than the other dishes, but had a good bit of coconut in it so it's up to your preference. The pad see ewe was not made well and had a funny taste to it. The service was alright we only had our drinks refilled once. The waitress was nice though. I would give this restaurant a 2/10.",

You could tell that everything was fresh, and still steaming hot on the plate. The portion size is healthy; you will get full. I'm grateful that there were plenty of vegetarian options on the menu that were customizable to be made vegan. I had the Pad Kee Mow with vegetables and tofu. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai with tofu. To make my dish vegan, I had them prepare it without fish or oyster sauce, no msg, no egg. The flavor was great because of the fresh basil and tomatoes in the dish.   All in all, a pleasant first visit. The only reason why I gave it a three-star rating is because the price of the food doesn't match the ambiance and level of service. Should be at a lower price point in my opinion.",

And this is a relatively new strip plaza, so when I pulled over to let Yelp find me a late dinner, I was pleased when this popped up.  I chose the fresh spring rolls with shrimp to start. These were prepared very quickly and were pretty good. A nice portion of shrimp in there with a bowl of cold peanut sauce for dipping.  But before I'd even manage to dig into a second spring roll, my Pad Thai with chicken arrived. Good texture and plenty of chicken, but the flavor was rather bland. No heat at all.  There were a couple of other tables, but they already had their food when I arrived. So the kitchen wasn't very busy which might explain the poor timing. And as for the spiciness of the Pad Thai, perhaps the gal taking my order should have asked me if I wanted it spicy? Or should I have spoken up?",

    "text": "My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte from Hawaii, the land of awesome Asian food! We had an undying urge for sticky rice. You know the kind you can pick up with two fingers and not a grain falls. I have had Thai food on the mainland and know that its a bit different. For example, red thai curry should not have red/green bell peppers and baby corn as filler. Knowing that, we just wanted the rice. So we searched nearby places via Yelp and found this one.   When we called and asked for sticky rice, she mentioned mango rice. I was confused as I have never heard that before. I said no just plain sticky rice, two orders. She said ok, she would need to make it. I found this odd as I figured sticky rice was served with meals being a Thai place and all.  We arrived, rice not quite done (no biggie), and she rang us up. I practically fell over when she said $10 and some change. I did not recall the change because I was hung up on the 10 bucks! What, for rice!!!!! Holy crap!!! I can see $2 per order but DAMN! We let it go. I mean she did make it fresh. So apparently the rice they make normally is mostly for dessert. I'm used to a tapioca type dessert with bananas.    Bottom line, no one should pay that much for rice. Seriously...ouch. I can't comment on the other food items. But really, it's rice. One ingredient.",

The shrimp were nice sized and cooked well and were very tasty, I think there were about 8-10.  My absolute only complaint is the veggies all I received was red, yellow, and green peppers and some basil, it was also suppose to contain green beans and bamboo and zucchini which are some of my fav veggies, I was quite disappointed there wasn't even a hint of any of them and that's the only reason for 4 stars and not 5, otherwise the dish was tasty and delicious.",

So I stopped.  I ordered my family's dinner to go and I was told it would be 25-30 minutes for food to be ready. I actually reacted and said \"what?!\" The cashier just looked at me with an apologetic look. I was hungry so I went for a walk to kill time. I returned 20 minutes later and my food was ready. When I dug into the pad Thai at home my soul became happy. It was the best pad Thai I've had in Charlotte in 10 years. I've been all over town for pad that. This batch was freaking awesome. It was \"Thai hot\" and I finished a large dinner portion, barely breathing through it. My son ordered a pepper steak dish and it was great as well.

I ordered the Shrimp and Pineapple Curry which has been my  favorite dish. Usually it is served in a pot that is over a sterno flame and is full of jumbo shrimp and pineapple. Instead, tonight, it was not served under a flame,  had only 6 medium sized shrimp and a limited amount of pineapple.  My husband's dish of pork red curry was more like a 3 star although he ordered a 1 star. If the disappointing food was not enough, the service was slow and unattentive and we were the only customers there at the time. The server made my husband a thai iced tea instead of the thai iced coffee. Although he did apologize, he didn't comp his drink or bring the correct one. I really hope things can improve.",

What disappoints me most about this place is that the owner sneakily adds her own high rate of gratuity to every check. Since she writes every check out in Thai and doesn't disclose the fact that the gratuity is included, I was duped several times into tipping her twice - usually resulting in a 40% tip for her to pocket for subpar service and inedible food.",

The fried rice is flavorful with plenty of  perfectly cooked veggies and chicken is tender.  Honey chicken is tender fried pieces in sweet honey sesame seeds that is served with a large side of white rice.  Nice beer selection, good sweet tea, hot tea and served with quick attentive service.    Located off the main road Hwy 49, worth many revisits.",

We have never eaten in, as we always take it to go. I love their yellow curry here, and my husband's favorite is the pad prik king. We both get ours the second to highest level for spice, and it never disappoints. We have switched up several of their starters, and we have always enjoyed them as well. While the two above are our favorites, we do switch it up and have tried several other dishes and are always very happy with our choices. The employees are always super friendly.   We have been to Thailand, and this food is by far the closest to authentic that we have had.. Again, I wish it was just closer!!! A definite must try for a Thai food lover!",

    "text": "Located amidst the White Hall Business centers, I could sense this could be one of the most crowded restaurants for lunch. We decided to try this for dinner on a Friday night. Stepping inside you get a feel of the ambience being in the middle between a well decorated and a ruined one. There were interesting painting around the wall but there were really weird objects you shouldn't find at a restaurant - an old Thai Beer bottle on the self with a very thick coat of dust, boxes/packaging items stacked up, and lot other less significant objects. Made me wonder if the restaurant is part car garage/store room.   We ordered food and waited for around 20-30mins... nah, food didn't turn up, waited for another 10 or more minutes until we saw the food plates. In fact there were only less than 12 to 15 people in the whole restaurant. Everyone seemed to be sitting impatiently and watching faces and no one was eating. We came in very hungry but by the time food came, we forgot all our hunger.   My friend and me ordered Stir fry dishes which was a big let down - totally bland tasting dish, no sauce or spicy flavors other than a tonne of greasy oil! Our friends got curry dishes which seemed way better!   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you work on one of the office buildings on the White Hall Business Drive. The food comes late, not the best tasting food and you could get better looking ambiances else where!",

    "text": "Reading all these good reviews is really making me wonder if I ate at the same place?? Ok, its one thing if a bad time happens once, but 3 times?? C'mon guys, we are talking about the same place off of Arrowood 485, past Walmart?  Here are my experiences, wrapped into one: The first time I headed there after reading such positive reviews on Yelp back in 2010. I held back writing an ill review because I planned on giving it another try. At the time, I ordered a Red Curry with 4 level spiciness. As always, we were offered the complimentary soup and it was very delish. Light and just enough to make way for the main meal. When the entrees arrived, they were ill-timed. Mine came out waaaaay before my lunch buddy's, which sucked because I always wait to raise my fork. Anyway, it came out a while later and we commenced. The spiciness was right but the saltiness was horrible, just plain horrible. I didnt want to bother because we were crunched of time. I simply squeezed the slice of lemon that was hanging off my glass, and it sort of mellowed it out. I ended up eating only 60% of the curry, because the rice to curry ratio was off.....maybe because of the salt factor? Service was also like the dish----a bit salty :)  Second time I went with my brother who was visiting from college. We decided to try Siam again for lunch and arrived when it was a full house. This time I ordered Pad Thai. When my meal arrived, it was something completely different, no noodles in sight but some kiind of ground meat with some veggies and slices of jalapeno!! I had to wait forever to get the servers attention and when I finally did, he apologized and asked to replace it. Again, I didnt want to kill valuable time so I stuck to whatever it was. It was too spicy for my liking, but whatever. This time too, the service was blah  but I understand with a full house that this is expected.  The 3rd and last time I went with my little sister visiting from TX. I had full faith in my fellow yelpers, so we decided on Siam again. Bad idea!! I ordered the Massamun with no spiciness at all and sweet tea.  I get the right dish this time, but the tea was unsweetened. No problem, Ill just add some on the table.....I did sweeten it, with sugar packets from 'Bojangles'!!! No lie! I mean the packs of sugar bore the trademark name/design of the chicken fast food place!!  How weird, or how creepy? Did someone just walk into a Bojangles and jack all the sugar packs from the tables, Lol, whatever the case is, it still makes me roar with laughter! Anyway, the Mussamun arrives and again, Im doomed with the saltiest plate! Why?? It always happens to me and its not just me, I made my sister try it  and she spit it out in disgust. The nice server apologized and asked to replace it, so I ordered a different item. The Yellow Curry, mild.  That was just very ok, nothing flavorful or memorable. All I tasted was basil and coconut milk.....not good.  All in all, I wont ever find myself there again. Bad service, too bold seasoned food and really no redemption for all these missteps.",

I went to yelp to see how others rate.  Besides, we went out late.  This one showed open till 10:00 pm  I called to make sure they are still open. I found this and I used my GSP to direct us thought it was close to where we live.  Great!  Gosh!  GPS took us to Whitehall Dr near Freedom with a bunch of houses with no restaurants. I called again to find out it was in other side of town.  I then looked for anther place that I used to go & on the way, I also called but that place closed.  Now our way was closed to this Thai restaurant.  We said perhaps we would go to see if they still serve.n 36 This is actually 3607 Whitehall Park Dr that is closed to 485 exit Arrowood Road. We arrived 9:35 pm seeing only two cars there with OPEN sign.  We said let's see if they still served.  The lady said 'yes' and we said Charlotte really not a place like LA or NYC.  We better tried. We ordered Tung Yam all the time and we tried the Pok .. with seafood in small portion for each at $6.00  It came with good portion of seafood, big shrimp, scallop and fish, spicy as we asked for. A dishes of Pai Thai (Fried rice noodle Thai style) with Chicken and A dishes of Red Curry with Beef that comes with Rice.  Both tasted pretty good.  Was it because we were hungry?  Actually, they are much better than the Thai restaurant we went in University.  Totally was slightly over $40 with a soda.  Not sure if we were late and the restaurant was already cleaned for the next day.  It was cleaned...  Once again, the address on top is wrong.  It is 3607 Whitehall Park Dr.",

The tofu is always perfectly cooked, a litttle crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  For Kids, the thai spaghetti is a perfect! A basil heavy red sauce over noodles. As in the the previous reviews, i have to agree the the service is weakest point of this otherwise perfect restaraunt. I can deal with bad service if the food is so good. I have found that Friday lunch is awful. I waited an hour to get my food one Friday. The best days are Mon-Wed. I also agree about the owner. Like in the show 'Cheers' every time i walk in and she greets me by name, She gives me a hug, and asks how i am doing. Although the sign says do not touch the headress...  Update. I've given Siam the rightful star it deserves. I've been in several times and the service had improved. Seems fair enough.",

Draws from many of the local businesses west of the airport. You will probably need to Google the location or pull out the GPS. It deserves a 3.5 rating",

Reading the 1 star reviews here completely match up to my experience: lousy food, grunting waitress/owner, vegetables undercooked, shrimp overcooked, long wait for water, etc. but my food came out almost too fast. I had just gotten my appetizer, had a couple bites, and there was my entree! It was like she wanted to get rid of me as quick as possible!   I was extremely nice to her, but that made no difference. Meanwhile, she's chatting it up with the other few folks in the restaurant. It seems that if you're a regular, you get great service and good food (I guess...), but if you're a first-timer you get treated like dirt. I don't know how they get repeat customers, as I will surely never return, and will spread the word as much as I can.  This was the worst dining experience I can recall ever having!",

The Siam Honey Chicken is good, kind of a Thai take on General Tso's so good for people trying Thai for the first time.  Had the Green Curry with beef tonight - excellent.

We've been three times now and see them as one of our favorite places to eat really good Thai food, or just a nice dinner in general.   Each time I've eaten here has been in the evening, dinner hours.  The establishment offers a relaxed atmosphere for dining and because of the location, isn't in a busy area of town. It's a very well decorated and clean dining area, has friendly and personable service, great food, great beer selections, great prices, and really good variety. Pad Wooten might be my favorite dish. They have an excellent assortment of tasty appetizers (I would recommend the deep fried breaded brocolli and cheese) and the mango rice for desert left a lingering crave in my girlfriend's mind to this day. Her son, who is the pickiest eater I've ever met, said that the kid's meal version of shrimp and onion rings were the best he's ever had. I reccomend this place to everyone who is in the mood for Asian food or wants to try something new in general.",

The owner is from Thailand.  The dish you frequently order is Pad Thai.  Try something out of the ordinary and order the Thai salad or the rice noodle soup with vegetables.  Both are staples in Thailand.  If you go to a restaurant and neither of these are on the menu, you're at a restaurant that doesn't know or offer real Thai food.  Those of you who gave this restaurant a thumbs up.  You hit the nail on the head!  Next time try a curry dish with coconut milk served with white rice.  I am from Thailand and if your review of Thai food is based on your experience eating Chinese, stick with what you know.",

    "text": "The food here is excellent and is what brings me back to this restaurant. What is not so excellent at this restaurant is the service. A few colleagues and I like to venture here on our lunch break, but the ordeal takes a while.   Being seated is rarely an issue, even when the dining area is packed at noon. Once seated, however, it may be ten minutes or more before drink orders are taken-- the good thing is by then I have likely made a decision about what dish to order. At lunch, guests receive a complimentary soup prior to their order. The ginger soup is my ultimate favorite, though the Miso is a close runner up. The soup is a great way to tie you over (if you're starving like I am by lunchtime) until the dish is served. The time from order to place-mat ranges, but the average is 20 minutes or so.   The red curry is to die for!!! I order the red curry with chicken over brown rice-- at a level 2. **Levels: Dishes such as the curry, the waitress will ask you which level you want. This refers to the level of spicy you enjoy. The spice levels are very liberal; beware the higher numbers (4 is HOT. But if it is your dig, try level 9 like one colleague I know. His brow is literally sweating!) **  Another great dish is the cashew chicken (loaded with veggies). This dish is nice simply because of the veggies. Big blocks of broccoli, , red and yellow bell peppers, and onion scatter the plate. This is a nice change from the curry (no matter how much I love it), as the curry only offers a few red bell peppers.  The waitresses are polite, but not very personable, and the owner is always bustling around keeping careful watch over her business. She is certainly nice enough, but we have all agreed that sometimes her mood swings come across to us.   Definitely check out the interesting decor; there is ample of it for your viewing pleasure.",

Normally, I'm told it'll be about 25-30 mins before the food is ready. Fine. However, there have been several times that when I got there after 30 minutes, I've still had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes for the food. Very inconvenient and defeats the purpose of calling in. I've always been cordial with the owners and other wait staff even after these ridiculous waits. Today, I mentioned to one of the workers there that I had a problem with my additional 20 minute wait time. The owner overheard and went into the register and slammed a $10 bill into my hand and got nasty with me when I was NOT nasty or rude with either of them. She kept telling me \"bye..bye\". I was not even asking for a refund just making a suggestion to give more accurate food pick up times. I did not appreciate the rudeness. I see a few other reviewers have encountered rudeness as well.

So we were surprised at how limited our options in this area were and the price tags for what we ordered from Siam Garden (Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Panang Curry, Spring Rolls and Mango w/Sticky Rice). The price points were at least validated by the very large entree portions we brought home...but our delight over the amount of food didn't really translate to the taste of the food. The Panang was, by far, the best, earning a solid 4 stars. Very tasty. The flavor of the Pad Thai was just ok but there wasn't really much flavor there. The Drunken Noodles were thrown out. Do yourself a favor and avoid them (Pad Kee Mow). Spring rolls were satisfactory. Mango w/sticky rice was well done and a nice way to finish the meal. Overall, on average, everything was just ok. Really, wed rate this place 2.5 stars but yelp doesn't allow the half stars. Makes it hard to justify a return visit, particularly for the ~$14 price per entree.  Keeping our fingers crossed that, as this area continues to expand and develop, we get some additional options to choose from.",

The chicken satay appetizer is served with a thick peanutty sauce and a great side of cucumber and onion mixed with a sweet sauce.  To die for!   The red curry is the best I have ever had in my life.  (Um ok I have never been to Thailand....just getting that out there.)  It comes with a side of rice.  The Massuman curry is like other places (like Monsoon) but a touch better because the sauce is thicker.  The owner says she uses a 90/10 split coconut milk to water ratio instead of the usual 50/50.    It is a TAD pricey, you can easily spend 16 bucks for lunch and have just enough food but it is worth it.    I didnt give it five stars because Jesus Mary and Joseph it is so far away!

We have been lamenting the fact that there are no Thai restaurants in our area. Last night on our way home from an out of town visit, I used Yelp to find something. Never heard of Siam Garden but enjoyed the stories every told about the little old lady.  I actually followed the advice of the guy who said \"if you don't mind the long drive, it is worth going.\"  They really are a little out of the way but now I know it is less than 15 min from my house. Yay. We ordered Pad Thai w chicken and Pad Thai w pork. We both loved it. Take out order is indeed huge and enough for 2 people. I got the fresh rolls and loved them. Hubby got the angel fried wings which were ok, a bit dry. When I picked up the food there was what looked like THE little old lady, so I asked her \"have you read the Yelp reviews?\" She looked puzzled and said \"no what are they saying?\" So I told her to read them herself. haha. We will definitely be back to pick up from this restaurant. It is about 7 min from the Harris Teeter at Steele Creek so if you want decent Thai food, you have to at least try them out soon! I will be back to try out their Thom Kha soup and curries.",
