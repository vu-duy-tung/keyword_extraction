    "text": "I live right across the street from this place so I decided to visit this Friday with my man and 5 year old. We arrived at 7:20 and proceeded to wait to be seated like the sign at the empty host stand read. After about 2 minutes a server walks past and says how they will be right with us, we waited another 3 minutes or so and a different server walks past and says the same thing. So we decided to sit and wait on the comfortable couch at the front door. We saw many open tables right in front of us. It seemed like the lady manager was more focused on the jazz show starting than she was greeting paying guests. Needless to say no one ever came, we decided it was no longer worth the wait at about 7:40. Terrible experience. My son was very hungry and we had to leave and find another restaurant in uptown Charlotte on a Friday night.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place since the majority of the reviews were good. However, I am very disappointed that I did. We arrived at 146 for a 2:00 reservation we made two weeks prior. We were seated right away but it took twenty minutes before someone came over and took our drink order. They placed lukewarm corn muffins on the table and left. After another twenty minutes we had to pull a server aside and ask who was our waitress because we hadn't received our drinks. Finally she took our order again and brought us our drinks, apologizing that they hadn't arrived yet.   We ordered our food at 2:30. That time frame is unacceptable. It shouldn't take 45 minutes for someone to come over and take our order. But the real problem arose as we were waiting for our food. It took almost two hours for our food to come out. Our server kept apologizing for the wait but the owner/manager didn't bother to come and tell us what the problem was. Once our food arrived it was bland and needed seasoning. But by this time we were so hungry we didn't care.   When the manager finally came over to our table, she gave us excuses rather than trying to appease our group. She stated that the kitchen was trying to do the takeout orders as well as the dining room. Her comment was \"We had to shut down the takeout menu. Notice the phone stopped ringing.\" Not understanding what that had to do with anything because other restaurants are able to operate fully producing food for the dining room and to-go orders. Then she stated \"We make everything from scratch, made to order.\" So do most other restaurants.   The final clincher was that the manager came back over and gave us some 10% off coupons for our next visit. Some people in our party had ordered some to-go items and still hadn't received them after we had been waiting for more than 2 1/2 hours. When the manager was asked about this her response was \"You already got your food.\" She then stated that we would not be discounted for that current meal, even though the service was lousy and extremely horrendous. Not our server. She was great and we could tell she was getting extremely frustrated with the kitchen as well. But the owner was horrible. She offered more excuses than solutions. And she never apologized for the service just an excuse. After her display of attitude towards our frustrations we placed the 10% coupons back on the table and stated we weren't coming back. We also wouldn't suggest the place to any of our friends for them to be subjected to the same attitude.  I can understand that our food might have taken a little longer because we were a party of 6. But there was a table where there we only 2 people and they were waiting as long as we were. A lady came in and sat down while we were still waiting and then she waited for 30 minutes before anyone came for her. She finally cancelled her order and went to the bar to speak with the manager and the woman ignored her.   I will never come back here. If she had been apologetic then maybe I would have kept the 10% off coupon. But her attitude and service skills are ridiculous. That's not how you do business. I don't respect people who treat their patrons like crap.   Edited: The owner had the audacity to call us and tell us that some of our party hadn't paid for their food. But she was the one who rang everyone up and closed out the checks. She said we were damaging her bottom line. No her crappy attitude and customer service is damaging her bottom line. Positive, I am never returning.",

This was my first time at this restaurant and I would classify the management as lack luster based upon how they treated the presenters of a seminar that I attended.  While receiving valuable and life changing information from the presenter, management allowed a live band to begin to play and disrupt the seminar. Of the 27 patrons in the restaurant 25 were there for the seminar. There was no reason to begin the music during the presentation. Pure disrespect was displayed and an attitude which was reminiscent of what one would consider \"ghetto\". I will not return to this restaurant again as long as I am able to eat.",

We loved that all vegetables are turkey based. Complimentary corn muffins were just the right balance of sweet and corn. Decor is dark and elegantly masculine. Service was courteous,  yet could have been a little more attentive.  Have some kinks to work out and would suggest a small and simple side salad to accompany the dinner entrees/no side or 1 side items. Will back and try their lunch variety.",

Charlotte is a very fickle community however that from my experience haven't supported good businesses like this restaurant and it was obvious by the lack of customers dining in when I visited recently.   The kinks in service needs attention.   Except for the outstanding service and attitude displayed by the young lady who had the dubious role of serving and tending bar; one server in particular was a little too vocal and abrasive in demeanor. The lack of professional servers alone is an unnecessary distraction.    This is a great restaurant with a delicious cuisine. It is surrounded by hundreds of residents occupying the many condos and apartments,  many which are in walking distance. I would like nothing more than to see them attract more business.  They are definitely worth a visit based on the food alone.   Wishing them the best going forward and although I reside in Huntersville NC ,  I will be back.",

I got it fried but thinking grilled would have let me taste all that fresh crab even more. My daughters both got the catfish. One pecan encrusted and one etouffee. Both amazing. Green beans were overlooked bit so if you like them but crunchier just ask. Collard greens just like I like them. Red beans and rice fab. Cornbread was good but they need honey. Chef Cliff Freshwater came out to table and met us. He recommended trying the bread pudding side by side with peach cobbler and man was hat combo and party in my mouth. They were so kind they wrapped our leftovers and gave us extra fish and dessert for our flight back home to Cali. Thanks Shonna, Crystal and Tanya!! Made our one meal in Charlotte amazing.

They had someone playing the keyboard. I think his name was \"Groove\". We were immediately greeted when we walked in and got sat right away. I loved hearing the specials and the popular dishes to help us with our order from the owner. Staff was friendly and personable. We each got the seafood gumbo. It was delicious and flavorful! I got crab cake, catfish and grilled shrimp all blackened style. My side items were potato salad and red beans and rice. Potato salad was good and smooth. It's yellow based which I like! Red beans and rice had a good flavor. I added hot sauce to it to spice it up. My fiance got the salmon. It was the biggest piece we've ever seen from a restaurant! Slightly crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth in the inside. He said it was cooked perfectly. He also got okra and tomatoes and collard greens. Music wasn't too loud and the ambiance was just right. Staff was caring and knowledgable. I would definitely go back, especially on Thursdays when they have music! You can tell all their food was fresh and home made and that they genuinely care. Give it a try!",

We heard about the restaurant from the owners son while out in the city. We thought it would be a good idea to check it out after the son insisted he owned the restaurant. Actually turns out the son doesn't own the restaurant and the parents do. In my opinion just a bad marketing look. He was out drunk prompting a business for his parents, just not a good look.",

While I found the staff friendly, the service was a little slow, and the food just okay.  Even though I ordered a grilled pork chop, they brought me a fried one.  However at that point I didn't have time to send it back.  My co-worker discovered what he thought was bones or something in his crab cake.  But he rolled with it anyway.    The lunch prices are reasonable, and the place is very well decorated. In the end, they emphasize the wrong aspects of the dining experience by over reaching.  For example, they take the time to put place settings at all tables, but they fail to get orders right.  My co-worker had a to-go order, and when he asked for a bag for his leftover entree and dessert, the staff returned with two dinky brown paper bags which couldn't accommodate the containers.  What was particularly striking was while the owner was explaining their addition of jazz night and a full bar, she watched my friend struggle to squeeze the containers in the bag without any apologies or offer of assistance.  My advice is scale back the decor, and hire more experienced staff for better service and quicker turnarounds on the tables.  Get larger bags for to go orders.  And drop the crab cake, it's not that great.",

My Mother grew up in Louisiana.  I know good cajun/creole food and the food outside of the state of Louisiana just does not compare.  The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is I felt the food was pretty high in sodium.  But being good ole southern food, that is what you'd expect.",

She was very welcoming and generally seemed to appreciate my business.  The wait staff was very friendly and tried hard to please.  Now to the food.  It was delicious and the servings are large.  I had the fried catfish New Orleans style, which had a brown gravy and shrimp on to top/  When I tell you it was sooooo good!  I also had the sauteed cabbage and mac and cheese for side which were also tasty.  The four stars is because they don't currently serve any alcohol, I was anticipating getting a hurricane, but they are working on developing the bar.  In the meantime, it is BYOB.  Again, the owner is really sweet.  She promised my 2 yr old some ice cream if he ate his food.  He did and she fulfilled her promise.  I will be back.",

Food was made to order. We selected the wing meal with 2 homemade sides (tried the mac and Cheese, yams, and rice and gravy). The wings were delicious with a nice blend of seasonings, they were also very plump and the food was hot. The favorite of the sides were the yams. They also offered cornbread, it was okay not my favorite but non the less hot and warm. Overall great for a casual night out for soul food. Range $15-30 per entree.",

Second thing ,was that the that the staff absolutely polite courteous and attentive. The owner met us at the door and her introduced  herself and began to explain the restaurant the menu and their experience in cooking New Orleans style cuisine for over 20 years.The first thing that they brought out to us  was the cornbread muffins. They were not what we have become accustomed to when it comes to a soulful cornbread muffin. It was northern style but we're down south so if you love Martha Stewart cornbread then you'll love these !!! Now if you love Patti Labelle cornbread skip them there not worth the Calories .The second thing Was my seafood platter.... i am from the Washington DC area So when it comes to Crab Cakes  these we're terrible!!! Because I am a Marylander and we have the best Crab Cakes in all of the World !!! I just shouldn't of order them !!!! its probably just a Chesapeake bay thing with us . If you never had a real Jumbo Lump Crab cake from Maryland then you'll love them Hahahahahah !!! Third thing was the the Ribs they were fair .. A simple oven baked Rib with Barbecue Sauce nothing fantastic... The Pecan Crusted Catfish was Fair the rice & gravy was OK the Greens we're cut up very small and reminds us of glory Greens in the Can .. The Mac&Cheese was a Truly disappointing you can not have a restaurant in North  Carolina Be Successful without having Fantastic Mac&Cheese... Now after saying all of That I must Say Freshwater has the BEST CATFISH NUGGET & Catfish I have every had !!!! Period .....Light ,Crispy ,Golden, Flakey & Fantastic... Sharon & her Husband (the Chef) should Change the name of this Restaurant to \"Carolina Catfish\" I will eat here again in One Years Time when I come back for CIAA to see if anything has changed but until then the only thing I would eat here would be The Catfish & please Tip the Staff well they are doing the best that they can with the Cards they were dealt  ...",

    "text": "This is one of those times when I wish that Yelp allowed for half stars.  This restaurant ranks between a 3 and 4 but I will round up and call this place a solid 4.   This place considers themselves a fine dining restaurant. I will say that it is hard to find a soul food restaurant in Charlotte that doesn't serve their food in styrofoam so if you are looking for a place like that, this isn't it.  When you first enter the restaurant you the tables are set using chargers and all. There is some african american art on the walls for decor and a fountain with water.  I think this place has potential.  As for the food, I order the seafood sampler which came with a crab cake,  4 shrimp and fried catfish.  They also serve cornbread before the meal but in my opinion it didn't taste very fresh at all but the people I was dining with loved it.  I will say that crab cake was amazing and I wish I would have just order those.  You can actually taste and see the crab in the cake.  I don't recall there being any flour in the crab cake. The catfish was decent but I think I personally could have used a little more seasoning in the batter on the catfish. The two sides I ordered were collard greens and macaroni and cheese.   I could have done without the macaroni and cheese because it wasn't very cheesy to me.  As for the collard greens I wish their was a little kick to them but again that is personal preference because the people I was dining with really enjoyed them.  Overall, this is a decent restaurant.  It isn't your typical soul food place you will find in North Carolina.",

The food came out in good time. I loved the fact that the crab meat was seasoned and that there was no thick batter coating it. Despite being fried, it was extremely light and delish. The mac and cheese was good but, the collard greens came out really bitter and had a very porky aftertaste. It was my first time trying collard greens, maybe its not my thing...

She was nice, said I could keep the shrimp (which she did end up coming back to get) as she ordered the chicken but not without  subtly implying that I did order the shrimp (as in to suggest that the mistake was mine and not hers). I felt prompted to gently correct her by informing her that I know I didn't order shrimp because I only like battered shrimp which is only offered as an appetizer.  As a result I ended up waiting an inordinate amount of time for 4 small bites of chicken. But overall, the sides were good and I will be back again.",

    "text": "You MUST GO HERE NOW!!!! My husband and I were debating if I should write this review- I'm selfish and want to keep this place all to myself, and my husband said I must share. Well, I don't remember how I came across this restaurant but we are so glad that we came here.  As soon as you walk in, the staff is greeting you. Shawna was our server. She is super sweet and super helpful. She gave us recommendations and was patient with us Our order:  Appetizer: fried crab cake  Theeeee best crab cake my husband and I have ever had. There is no breading in it, all crab, very tasty.  Entrees: shrimp etouffee, salmon and shrimp Sides: cabbage, candied yams, red beans and rice   The food was so good, we switched plates half way through the meal. The shrimp etouffee was so good. The gravy was delicious, and the cabbage was perfectly cooked.  The salmon and shrimp was nothing short of amazing! The piece of salmon was huge, but extremely moist and very flavorful, as were the shrimp. The yams were perfect!!! The red beans and rice were good.  I wanted to take food for lunch, but we couldn't stop eating. My husband even asked about dessert, which he never does. He ordered the carrot cake. The carrot cake capped off our perfect meal. It was moist and flavorful and we could not eat the very last bite. Seriously, my belt couldn't hold on any longer!!!   I even ordered from the Wednesday wine selection. Shawna suggested a red, which I didn't care for initially but it was ok. She ended up bringing what I initially ordered.  I kept waiting for something bad to happen but it never did.  The owner came over and we spoke for a few minutes. She too, is absolutely lovely.  Freshwaters gets 5 stars across the board: for food, service, and ambiance. I am already planning our next visit.  Do yourself a favor and go there. You will not be disappointed.",

First, our greeter was very professional and friendly, seated us quickly and made us feel at home. She recommended drinks and gave us direction on the menu, also letting us know how fresh it would be and how it would be prepared for us. This is called \"priming the pallet\" (not an official term).  Once she took our orders, the food came out hot and fresh and exactly how she said it would. The first bite was amazing and the last bite was sad. That's all I remember between that time period. I ordered cajun catfish, with candied yams, and greens (salivating as I type this).  One issue did come up with a mix up on a plate and it was quickly fixed. The chef actually brought the corrected plate out to us, himself.   The owner even came out to ask how it all was.  All I know is, I'm going back for some sweet potato cheesecake AND peach cobbler because it would be rude not to.  Thank you Sharon and Nichole!",

She didn't even acknowledge me at all at first and then finally she asked if she could help me after allowing me to stand at the bar for about 5 minutes with no acknowledgement or even eye contact. Then told me it would be another 7 minutes. Once she gave me my total I asked her how many dinners she had rung up because the total was higher than I had anticipated, she instantly got an attitude. The food was \"ok\", but the service was terrible so unfortunately I won't be back.

    "text": "A couple years ago Sharon and Cliff Freshwater moved from NJ to Charlotte to offer their spin on Cajun/Southern cuisine.  They went into the location where Simmon's used to be (a divey soul food joint in 4th Ward that closed around 2010).  They have done a great job remodeling and bringing it up to standards.  I liked the ambience (great jazz spinning on the CD), which may be better suited for evening dining than my lunch grab on a busy day.    Sharon waited on me at the bar and filled me in on their vision, Cliff's training with Paul Prudhomme, and being raised in East Carolina.  'Nuff said.  Chef Cliff cooked up a great grilled catfish with his special brown sauce (think etfouffee with its deep tones and rich flavors).  Mmmm.  I should have ordered a double!  The collards, however, let me down which I thought needed an extra day simmering with smoked pigs feet and hot sauce getting all happy with the greens.  Mac-n-cheese was a good riff on a Southern classic.  I think Freshwater's is a needed restaurant in this sector.  They are trying to put a more upscale spin on what is typically diving joints near industrial centers.  I say, \"Give 'em a Whirl!\"",

Instead, they just charged me for the regular catfish. I really wanted my shrimp, but as slow as the service was, I figured I wouldn't get my shrimp in good time.

    "text": "I enjoyed my experience at Freshwaters! The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. I had the catfish appetizer which was a decent size for two people. The sauce served with the catfish was great! I also had the yams, Mac and Cheese and Pecan Crusted Catfish. The yams were just right (not too sweet and not too mushy). I'd give the Mac and Cheese a 3 out of 5 simply because it was a little greasy. The Pecan crusted catfish was just okay. Everything was made to order. The atmosphere is very homey and romantic at the same time. Overall I was pleased and would return.",

However, the crab cakes were advertised as lump crab meat when they weren't. It looked and tasted more like claw meat so I was disappointed. They also said the veggies were made with turkey. When I got the collards there was no turkey and tasted more washed off glory greens. Overall, it was an ok meal. I'd probably try them again but only get the items that were great.",

The server asked if this was our first visit and if so, Mrs. Fresh would come over and walk us through the menu. We received some corn muffins while we waited. Mrs. Fresh came over, nice lady! She explained(complained) she was short staffed and then walked us through the menu. Decent prices but not really a Cajun/creole restaurant despite the selection. I ordered the blackened salmon, mac &cheese and greens. My husband ordered the ribs, yams and green beans. Took awhile but when our food came it was pretty good! The mac & cheese was baked and creamy!! Greens were bland, but fresh. My salmon was a bit over cooked. My hubs ribs were tender and he liked the sauce, you can tell the were crockpot ribs not smoked on a grill. He liked the yams too, but the greens beans were over cooked, bland and seemed like they were frozen French cut. Generous portions, we both had a to go box. Due to the short staff, refills on the drinks were not offered and we didn't get to see the desserts either. My hubs said we'd eat here again. I agree. Hopefully they will hire reliable people. I don't understand why the are open for lunch during the week. Location is not ideal for Uptown workers with an hour lunch. I'd open for lunch on Friday- Sunday.",

My colleague ordered the grilled trout and said it was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I had wonderful catfish fingers and a side of red beans and rice.

    "text": "In town for a family reunion and discovered this little gem. The sides were fantastic. We had the collard greens, string beans, candied yams, and Mac n cheese. Almost didn't get the last item as the picture here made it look like cheese sauce and not baked cheese. Ignore photo and order.   Lest we forget the mains. Catfish etoufe was flavorful but mild for my taste. Nothing a little hot sauce didn't fix! The jambalaya was both sweet and spicy and made with turkey sausage. Sides were made with turkey meat as well. That is what made this place for our family. The dishes were accessible for the many non pork eaters.   Didn't earn the fifth star because there was a problem splitting the bill at the end across two credit cards. Instead of splitting down the middle as requested, for some reason they had to split the dishes across two checks. One ended up $20 more than the other. Not until we inquired were we informed. Additionally, it appears my relative was charged twice. Reaching out today to rectify. Will update post.",

However, at this time I am going to have to rate it a 3 as we literally waited more than a hour for our food (about 1.5hrs). We were advised there was only one cook in the kitchen, which yes only one person can do so much, but for a Saturday night that is unacceptable. There wasn't an explanation regarding if someone called out or if that was the norm. I do want to give credit to the waitress and bartender who were so friendly and accommodating in the meantime.  I plan to try again in the near future and will provide an update at that time.",

It was because so the lunch portions are half the size of the dinner portions I was still able to get a pork chop with two sides for $8.69! Unbelievable! I already told my wife that we need to go there for lunch next week.  Nonetheless, the food is just simply amazing and the staff is so friendly; especially Mrs Freshwater herself. She always makes you feel right at home.  Upon entry you're always greeted with a warm welcoming smile and one of the best cornbread muffins you'll ever have! Are always hot and fresh from the oven. I was there with a group celebrating a birthday for one of my coworkers and though the restaurant had quite a few other patrons (which was unexpected given that is off the beaten path) there was no shortage of good service. Though it's not right in the middle of Uptown I guess it is not that unexpected to see a lot of people there since the food is so great and authentic.  We were a group of about eight so there were several different orders but everyone seemed to love their meals. I had the pork chop (which is prepared either fried or grilled with onions and peppers) and my sides were cabbage and sweet potatoes. Both were really good. As a matter of fact every single side that I have had there has been awesome. As a side note (pun intended), they offer a platter of sides as a vegetarian option. Other people in my group got crab cakes, ribs, and chicken breast with several different side options. The crab cakes are all Meats with no fillers so I'm excited to try them next time I go.",

The decor is pretty  and the \"feel\" of Freshwaters is very inviting.   Someone is always there to greet you warmly and each time I've been there, it has been the owner :)  There's also a wall of pictures when you 1st walk in, with all of the celebrities that have been there.  Ok, on to the food. I had a platter the first time with shrimp, fish, a crab cake and sides. It was so good! Most recently, I went for lunch and had the shrimp etoufee with collards and an arnold palmer. The dish was delicious and filling, and the Arnold palmer was on point too. My Mother-in-Love had the ribs, potato salad and collards. I saw the ribs falling off of the bone with my own two eyes, as well as the cleaned plate and bowls once she was done, lol!   The price was certainly reasonable. It was less than $10 per person #win  Customer service is top notch every time and I can't wait to go back.  Also learned from our server, that they host events often (including a New Year one tonight). Looking forward to attending some time soon.   Definitely give this establishment some love!!",

    "text": "Smh... what a terrible experience! We arrived for a birthday dinner, however, we had no place setting, no silver ware, no inquiry into drink orders, and not a care from the staff or owner for over an HOUR! While listening to the excuses from the waitresses and the chatter amongst other diners, Freshwaters was short staffed. Communication of that circumstance from the owner would have made a world of difference.  The FOOD:  Mac n cheese- from a box. Gross.  Crab cakes- Meh. Underwhelming.  Fried shrimp - was tough for such a juicy looking, lightly battered appetizer. This leads me to believe that the shrimp is purchased pre-COOKED and they simply batter it and throw it in the fryer for a couple minutes. Very tough consistency.  Fried catfish appetizer - had the same batter as the shrimp which is always disappointing. Switch it up. If I pieced the small pieces of fish together, I'd say they chopped up a half of filet of catfish and labeled it as an appetizer. The portion size was laughable.  Shrimp creole - was swimming in water from the tomatoes used in the sauce. The sauce was obviously tomatoes, accompanied by some other vegetables, which was then thrown into the food processor, sauteed for a couple of minutes, then accompanied by those tough pre-cooked shrimp. That sauce deserved to be cooked low and slow for hours to reduce and develop the deeper flavors. Then, we wouldn't have to deal with that pesky raw veggie flavor enhanced only with salt and swimming in tomato water.  Catfish etouffee - was brown sauce seasoned with salt. Disappointing.  Everything tasted as though it was seasoned with salt alone. It was a no pepper, no garlic powder, no onion powder, no paprika, no creole seasoning zone.  Who are the Owners trying to fool? Charlotte is full of well traveled foodies who also love to cook at home. Why should I spend my hard earned cheddar in your restaurant when I could cook your chefs under the table from my own kitchen at home?  You have got to do better.",

Had I not attended this seminar, I would have never patronized this restaurant.  After I sat myself at my table, I was approached by two young waitresses. I thought it was a bit much, or maybe one of them was in training or something. I asked for a drink menu or if there were any drink specials, and the owner, Sharon, charges my table, interrupts the waitress as she was answering my question and proceeds with telling me the wine options! Now, I have three waitresses at my table!  I thought that was so very rude, unprofessional and so not necessary! So, I divert my attention back to the waitress and ask for a glass of wine.  The owner, Sharon, barks at the waitress to \"write it down!\" Just nasty! So midway through the hour long financial seminar, the owner informs the keyboardist to start playing. He begins playing music, very loud, while the presenter was speaking!! So rude! I decided right then, I was leaving after the presentation and would never patronize this restaurant! I had called my husband to bring our daughter and meet me at the restaurant for dinner, but I quickly cancelled those plans and left!!",

I added some hot sauce to my etouffee and some of the other dishes could have used a bit more spice/seasoning but that could be just to personal taste. I like my food to have some bite. That being said everything was very fresh and absolutely delicious. The sides in particular are very good. I'm only sorry I was too full to try one of the homemade deserts.  The difference maker at Freshwaters is without question the staff and the owner. They are just fantastic. They are arguably the best in town. I was made to feel like I was the most important person in the room. They simply couldn't do a better job.  I look forward to going back for dinner. It really is a wonderful new option in Charlotte and definitely should be visited.",

The giant bowl of Jambalaya I ordered made two meals. My husband had the grilled blackened Salmon with a side of greens. Conveniently located in a pleasant walking distract means that ordering desert can be justified -  fresh made warm peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that my grandmother would have been jealous of. The atmosphere was relaxing, influences of the New Orleans Jazz and Blues vibe makes this a great spot for entertaining friends or for special occasions. The welcoming staff did not mind my stopping in dressed in casual attire on a whim, strolling by with my spouse. This place has the charm of a neighborhood favorite but so good you have to tell all your friends about it. I can't wait to try the crab cakes next time - friends of mine said they are delicious.",

Our food was cold and many of our guest waited 2 hours or more before food came out. Our guest began leaving due to frustration and hunger. No one including the owners ever once came out to apologize. They were out of short ribs and dark chicken which is what some of our guest wanted to order. The owner Mrs Freshwater argued with our guests which caused them to leave. We were never offered anything for our inconvenience, not even a complimentary appetizer for the unacceptable 2 hour wait. Our server wasn't informed about the menu nor what they offered.  Poor management and customer relation skills all around. Our group was overall disappointed and many left dissastified with the poor treatment and lack of concern by the owner. At best, it's a mom and pop shop and should not offer large party service until they are prepared to professionally accommodate the guests. Will not return nor will we recommend.",

The crab cake is absolutely delicious but you can do without the pork chop.

    "text": "My family and I went to the restaurant on Father's Day.  This was our first visit. There was a special menu for us to order from instead of the regular one. My husband and I ordered a NY Strip. We asked the waitress the size of the steak and she said she said she thought 10 ozs. He ordered his to be cooked medium and I asked for mine to be cooked  medium rare to medium. His was to be blackened and when he got it, it was cooked well done and did not appear to be blackened the way we are used to getting at restaurants. My steak was also cooked well done.  We both told our waitress and she apologized and said she would have more steaks cooked for us. One of the owners told my husband she would have another one cooked for him and wanted to make sure how my husband wanted it cooked. She told him that it was due to the cut of meat they had. She never checked in with me. The other owner or chef came out with the steaks and said rudely that if he knew we wanted them medium rare he would have cooked them that way.   Our steaks were actually cooked rare, but we could tolerate that better. The steaks had a lot of fat on them also - almost 4 ozs on my husband's. The owner checked back with my husband and when he showed her all the fat on the steak, she offered to get him something else. She asked him if he wanted to try the short ribs. She told him they were actually better than the steak. She told him that it was due to the cut of steak they had.I had also asked the owner if the lemonade was freshly squeezed and she told me it was. When I got it, it tasted like a mix. I switched it for an Arnold Palmer which tasted much better. The tea had juices mixed in it and there was pulp, but interestingly enough the lemonade did not have any pulp. I discussed the steaks with the owner and she told me that her husband is the chef and he said that medium cooked steaks do not have any pink in them. I told her that my husband is a chef and that there is pink in a medium cooked steak. She then told me that they normally do not have steak on the menu and it was  offered due to Father's day. She offered to provide me with a dessert which I accepted. My husband had already gone out before I spoke to the owner and he said he would have definitely discussed how steaks should appear when cooked to different temperatures. We originally went there because we wanted to try the New Orleans Louisiana cuisine but stayed even though they were not offering the items off their standard menu. We were not pleased with the food and the response of the owners. The waitress we had did take care of us to the best of her ability.",
