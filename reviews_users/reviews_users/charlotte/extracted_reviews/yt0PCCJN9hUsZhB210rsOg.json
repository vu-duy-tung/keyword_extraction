Great off the beaten path of food with loads of different kinds of one of a kind soups, sandwiches and chips you don't see in other places. This Corky little food find is a gem. When you want to try a great cup of Ethiopian coffee or a pure Buffalo Rock soda this is the place to go.",

It doesn't have all the \"charm\" yet of the Plaza location but it's coming along piece by piece, and sticker by sticker. It's kind of fun knowing the locals will be making it their own. The food is always great (Evil Homer on sourdough, pressed is my go to) and you can't beat the craft beer selection (either on tap or in the fridge).  I'd say I'm here close to twice a week , and if you're reading this review you should be too.",

The newest location, Common Market Oakwood, is one building from Clayworks (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnclay.com&s=248b698d0a1f01ff05ef3f72006a20a028a676b3ab3ea30fdf447af1a21cbac8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">learnclay.com</a>), the 4th largest ceramic arts educational non profit offering classes to adults and students, providing space for 26 resident artists, and THE pioneer organization which has led to the revival of Monroe Road. Staff at Common Market is uniformly helpful and efficient, and the seating is comfortable, intimate, and provides opportunity to meet and make new friends. Bravo to their newest location for maintaining the essence of the Common Market ambiance and friendliness.",

The Oakwold location has all the great things about the original South End location with the addition of glorious breathing room. My #1 beef about the old spots were how cramped and crowded they were, but this new Market retains the charm and spirit of the original with the ability to move freely.  The deli is exceptional. The menu covers just about anything you could want, and the folks behind the counter are happy to customize to your preference. For example, I ordered The Firehouse on gluten free bread and asked \"can I get a bunch of mayo on that?\" When my sandwich was ready, it was messy and slick with mayo, just like I'd asked. Perfect!  The ordering and paying system isn't perfectly intuitive, but it's easy enough to get used to. Order whatever you'd like from the deli, and they'll give you a ticket. Take that ticket with you and grab whatever else you'd like -- bottled soda, chips, other snacks -- and take everything to the cashier for payment. Grab a Common Market shirt or tchotchke while you're at it. Easy enough.  I love that the attached patio is dog-friendly. I'm happy that they have gluten free options. I 'm pumped about the friendly, funky space. I wish this Common Market the best of luck in the neighborhood and hope their success brings other great local businesses, too.",

It provides you with so many classic, low-key options for lunch. I love that I can come here and eat vegan and it also can be a place my boyfriend can get a traditional sandwich. Yay for a spot to go without a food war ;) They also have all the beverage needs you could possibly want, from kombucha to beer. As well as snack options and of course a good place to come to buy beer, wine and more for your home.   I had the straight jacket soy wrap and it was full of crisp, fresh veggies and tofu that holds up like a champ in the wrap. I will work my way through all the other vegan selections.   You can sit on the outside patio or inside. They have such friendly staff members that it's just so comfortable to swing in here.  We will be returning.",

That was the main difference between here and the old south end location and the new plaza location. The food here is consistent with the other locations. My go to is a craft soda and a custom sandwich if - turkey, pickles, banana peppers, bacon, and pimento cheese. It's gooey and since I used turkey it's totally healthy.   Common market has great little crafted snacks and drinks as well as a wide beer selection. It's a great place to buy some orange juice and champagne and drink mimosas while hungover and on the prowl for indie friends.   The bartender working at the time was awesome. He was so friendly and very witty. He had lots to say about my soda which made me even more excited about it. (Wish I remembered his name but he was a stalky guy with red hair and a golf like hat. )",

    "text": "I love the original Common Market on Commonwealth so it pains me to say that this one doesn't live up to that location's legacy. I came here one morning for breakfast when I was already on Monroe so I didn't have to drive the few additional blocks to the Commonwealth location. I now know that this was a mistake.   This is my third time here but the experience always seems to be lacking something though the cashiers are always friendly. I think there's a certain sterile vibe since the space is new and the clientele is a bit more straight-laced.   I walked in and was greeted by the friendly cashier. I placed my order at the window after perusing the specials for the day, I selected their vegan option which was a tofu scramble with vegan chorizo and assorted veggies. Everything seemed to be listed out nicely on the board in True Common Market fashion or so I thought.   So I order the breakfast to go and am chowing down on my way to work when my throat begins to itch and I notice some hard pellets throughout the wrap. I feel a sense of dread wash over me, \"NUTS!!!\" Now I'm only allergic to certain nuts but the itching in my throat worried me.   I immediately panic and call back to speak with the  kitchen just for confirmation.   Me: Excuse me, I was just in there and ordered the vegan special. Were there nuts in that?  Kitchenperson: Uh yeah.  Me: What kind? Kitchenperson: Walnuts.  Me: (panicking because this is one of the three to which I'm allergic) Ummm okay. Was that notated on the board? Kitchenperson: Uh no. (Almost puzzled) Me: Don't you think it should be, being that it's a common allergen? (This is what got me...) Kitchenperson: No. It's our brunch special every Sunday so all the regulars know that there are walnuts in there.  Me: Okay but what about newcomers? I've never eaten Sunday brunch at your location so I wouldn't know that. It should be clearly labeled. I actually frequent the other location for brunch so I wouldn't know that.  Kitchenperson: Well typically people ask. (Touche)/ Me: I normally ask at a place I don't know but I've always been told that it would be clearly labeled and there as it is on your website and the previous special boards I've encountered at Common Market. There was no indication that the listed ingredients would contain nuts. What was it in? Kitchenperson: The tofu scramble.  Me: (shocked) In all my years of vegan/vegetarianism I've never come across a tofu scramble consisting of more than tofu and maybe some various veggies and spices This is not typically a nut-containing dish.  Kitchenperson: Oh yeah well we put nuts in ours.  Me: (So annoyed and paranoid I'm going to go into anaphylactic shock). Well you all should really let people know when common allergens are in a special dish on the board. It's as simple as putting asterisks and contains nuts on the board.  Kitchenperson: Okay.   I was shocked and disappointed by the lack of empathy throughout the conversation. I grabbed my purse and chewed up two Benadryl and spent the rest of my workday zonked out and shaky. The only reason I'm giving the second star is because the cashier was so nice and because they had Cocomels in the checkout line. Not to mention I let my guard down based on my previous history with the company. Next time, I will just drive the extra few blocks to be with my Commonwealth crew and get my daily dose of hip, divey, positive vibes. They never disappoint.",

Once inside there are several seats at the bar and tables throughout for groups to gather and drink/eat and enjoy each other's company.

This new common market though, I think I will learn to love! I haven't tried their food yet but just based off the layout I think this place is a homerun. The first thing I noticed is they're outside seating is covered. Well, it's kind of half inside half outside but either way it protects from the elements which makes CM a great place to visit on a rainy day. The other big improvement I noticed was inside.  Unlike the other locations, this CM has tons of space. The large layout doesn't give you a cramped and confined feeling and everything is laid out nicely.",

We arrived and struggle to decide. But we ended up getting the Tree Hugger Wrap and my wife made a custom wrap. This is truly a market with a small grill at the back. They have a LOT of craft beer, wine and other interesting grocery food items. They had beer I have never seen before, and I consider myself in the know on craft beer.  Back to the wraps, they were both good. I wish I had followed my first instinct and made a grits bowl.  We will go back and try some other items, and buy some beer!",

I've seen him treat employees poorly in front of customers numerous times, and it makes it uncomfortable. Not only that but he never gets the simplest of orders correct. I don't know how it's so hard for some people to just listen. He's always ready to crack a joke...maybe he should focus on what he's there to do though.",

Prices are decent for the size (the turkey reuban I got was huge)! The cashiers and deli cooks are friendly and welcoming. If you work near here, ask about the deli punch card and after 10 punches on the card, you get a free item! Definately recommend this for a quick lunch spot-order in or take out. They also serve breakfast-I will have to come back and check that out!",

It's a chill punk themed space with good punk and rock music playing. There's a fun covered outdoor area to enjoy your sandwich/salad/beverage. They also have board games if you wanna hang out and play while you drink!  DELI: The deli is delicious! You walk up to the counter, put in your order and then pay at the front of the store. They have a TON of sandwich options and salads. For breakfast they offer about 8 options and build-your-own sandwich. They have vegan soy sausage and soy chorizo too! I was really surprised how much FLAVOR my sandwich had!!  COFFEE: self serve drip coffee as well as lattes, etc. the hazelnut drip was ok in my opinion, not amazing but it'll do. (If you're not a coffee snob you'll prob like it)  MARKET: fridge of prepared foods, chicken salad, sandwiches, cheese etc. they have tons of unique chips, snack bars, candy, local products and sodas (Mexican Coke!!). They also sell a few gifts and T shirts.    BAR: they offer chilled wine and beer (& mimosas) to enjoy at the long wooden bar as well as take-home wine and beer. There about 4 tall shelves of take-home beverage options and a whole wall of refrigerated options.",

Scrabble might not be your game of choice and luckily there are plenty of other options. You can get everything from gag gifts to king of pops in this marketplace type venue. I hear they have fresh juices and smoothies coming soon and I can't wait!!   I got the Mediterranean salad and the chickenless chicken salad.   Ps. The coffee and a great and always freshly brewed.
