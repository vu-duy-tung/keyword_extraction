    "text": "My favorite all-time pizza has been from Ledo's Pizza.  It isn't that its great pizza but its what I grew up with.  While I've had other places, nothing else has ever left me wanting pizza more than Ledo's.  Well, Ledo's has been replaced by Jet's Pizza.    Wanting something new, I wandered into Jets two weeks ago and placed an order for a 8 slice pizza with sausage, green peppers, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  It's takeout only so I waited, watched sports center played on my phone until my order was ready.  When the guy behind the counter handed me my order, I was shocked by the sheer weight of the pizza.    I took it back to my office where my colleagues tracked me down as soon as they saw the box \"JET'S PIZZA!!! CAN I HAVE SOME?!?\"  They knew what I was yet to discover.    The dough is amazing.  It crisps on the bottom and sides forming the perfect base for a rich tomato sauce, the gooiest mozzarella you'll find anywhere.  If there was a pizza heaven, I was there at first bite.  Really puts those round discs of trash into perspective.  I only had two slices before my colleagues at the entire pizza.    Went back on Friday for the same order, snuck in the side door to my office and enjoyed Jets again.  Very Very Very good.  This time, I had leftovers so I came home to see what it would taste like reheated.    385 in the oven for 11 minutes and its nearly as good as when first fresh.  That's awesome!  I'm an evangelist of Jets!",

I had tried Dominos version and it was decent but decided to give Jets a shot. Huge mistake, took pizza almost an hour to get to me, it was cold, way too salty and whoever cooked it had obviously never been inside a NYC pizzeria. It wasn't close. Had one slice, fed the rest to the dog and ordered Dominos.",

Jet's pizza is delish through and through. The crust is chewy and soft and there is probably about 7 pounds of mozzarella on each pizza. I agree with Faith's previous review that it is \"greasy like crazy\", but I'm pretty sure that's what makes it so darn good! The Jet's bread is mighty good also. Tons of cheese, same chewy crust and some delicious seasoning that puts it over the edge. My favorite thing over all though is probably the crispy, crusty cheese on the edges of the pizza. It is awesome. And as if delicious pizza wasn't enough, they deliver SO FAST. Call on a Friday night and it's there in 30 minutes. Crazy. The prices are also very reasonable for the level of awesomeness. Overall, Jet's is a delight.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try Jet's Pizza for a long time, but I so rarely order pizza to go that it's taken years.  Finally hubs was in the mood for pizza, and we were driving back wet and exhausted from getting caught in a huge thunderstorm in the mountains and so I got on my phone and went through their online ordering tool en route. It was awesome how many different customizations you can select for your pizza- thin crust, regular or deep dish (yes!), what flavorization you want that crust, do you want regular, light or heavy sauce or cheese (or none?), and how you like your crust baked. It brings a whole new meaning to the word personalized pan pizza! So I went ahead and paid for it and the tip/delivery online so we didn't have to worry about having cash. Maybe Domino's or Papa John's other delivery places have all these options but their quality isn't like Jet's so I wouldn't know. The best part? They give you a projected time while you're going through the checkout process so we could time it perfectly to arrive 2 minutes after we got in the door. Perfecto! And the delivery guy was spot-on too.  Far and away, it had more flavor than the standard ol' pizza from say Hawthornes or the like and the deep dish is a nice novelty.  My husband loved the Buffalo Chicken and I made a custom pie.  My only complaint is I would like a few more topping options like spinach, broccoli, basil, etc.   The only other downside was that for 2 small deep dish pizzas the bill including tip was $32 which seemed like a lot. The deep dish pizza is pretty filling though so I'd suggest instead of 2 custom smalls, get 1 large and do the toppings on half the pizza with your pizza partner (you can do that too in the cart) and you should save a lotta dough. Pardon the pun.",

Online it outlined what was on the pizza and left out quite a few toppings that ended up on the pizza when it arrived.  In addition I included some special instructions for the pizza which were completely ignored.  After 1.5 hours of waiting for my pizza on a Sunday night it finally arrived completely wrong. I called them and they did not even offer to have their driver come back out with the correct pizza.  I ended up having to drive to their location (completely defeating the purpose of delivery) to get another pizza.  In addition they would not give me the new pizza without me returning the old pizza(as if they could use it for another order....)  After arriving back home again we open the pizza box and they messed up the pizza again.(probably should have checked before leaving the store)  We just bit the bullet and ate it anyways because we were so sick of this whole ordeal.  I probably will not be ordering from this location ever again.",

    "text": "I recently had a dealsaver for $10 for $20 worth of pizza. On 7/7 I called to inquire about specials. She named a list of several and I took her up on one. Upon ordering I informed them that I have a dealsaver and the female informed me that I couldn't order any specials as I cant combine coupons. The dealsaver isn't technically a coupon nor is the specials--they are specials vs coupons. The female then placed the same order and the total jumped $17 from $30 to $47. It was evident that I was missing out on $17 worth of specials for a $10 savings. I explained to the female that again I wasn't combining coupons and she reluctantly agreed bringing my total again down $17. Upon showing up at my door, the receipt which had already been charged, was again back up $17. I called and asked to speak to the manager and explained to him that I wasn't combining coupons, simply taking them up on their specials--not to mention a dealsaver shouldn't constitute a coupon. The manager was extremely rude, not in the least understanding, and didn't have any objection to me sending the pizza back. I reluctantly did so despite having several unhappy and hungry people awaiting the pizza. I politely said prior to sending the pizza back that I had cleared up the issue prior to placing the order but again the manager was not understanding.   All this aside the pizza is not very good and wouldn't dream of ordering without a dealsaver.",

I called Jet's a few days ago as a little yelpy birdy told me that they have deep dish pizza. This was confirmed by a nice Jet's employee and I therefore raced to their website to get a good look. Well, it is deep dish pizza, but it's not Chicago deep dish (buttery crust, piles of cheese, sauce on top). And that's ok...I tried Jet's deep dish anyway! Note - there is no seating in Jet's, it's delivery or carry out only.   Hubs picked it up (but they deliver too) and it was pretty damn delicious. Thick 'za (1.5\" or so) topped with tasty, melty cheese and loads of fresh veggies. The deep dish wasn't too greasy IMO, but then again maybe the grease soaked into the buttery crust. I believe hubs paid $10.99 + one topping for a large (ten squares). While it wasn't ridiculously expensive the large isn't *that* large. I'll definitely order from Jet's again when I get a hankering for fluffy pizza. Mmm.",

You crave pizza, yet have already run thorough the obvious options, and don't really care what you choose, as long as it's dough with tomato sauce and cheese?    We just happened to be a stone throw's away, and this is how my husband and I ended up picking up a deep dish rectangle pie from Jet's.   Perhaps this review is a bit premature since I haven't tried their thin or hand tossed crusts, but I feel eating a good 6 pieces of this doughy, crispy pizza and becoming a full-fledged bloat-dette for the evening, I am fully qualified to write a review.   The key to Jet's is to get the pizza piping hot.  We got outs straight out of the oven, the cheese was practically bubbling when we got it.  The crust is super crunchy on the outside with a nice amount of grease, then doughy (but fully cooked) on the inside. Not too much sauce, but lots of cheese, sprinkled to the edges, and baked to an even crispier bonus cheese crisp.   Overall, this is like an amped-up version of a Pizza Hut pizza.  Let's make no qualms about it.  It's a chain, it's efficient, and I though pretty cheap.  Would have liked a little more sauce, or maybe more spice in the sauce, but overall, I can't complain.  Carb lovers unite!  TIP: There are PLEN-T of coupons out there, or if you don't have one, just ask the cashier if they can apply a special for you.",

Upon delivery I noticed our sodas were not given. Delivery guy says \"I never got em\" umm ok? No offer to bring them to me. I called and had very rude service. Mistakes happen, I get it but they did not offer to bring me the sodas I ordered. Instead she told me shed just refund me (in a not so nice or apologetic way. In fact no apology at all).  Problem #2: the pizza is solid so weeks later we tried again. This time with pizza and salads. All was fine with the delivery- until we started eating our salads and came across a STAPLE. A big metal staple. When I called the lady was so nonchalant like I had just told her I had pepperoni on my food--rather than a STAPLE. She said \"ok what do you want a refund?\" Ummmm yeah- and maybe an explanation as to how this landed in my dinner? She again was unapologetic and only refunded me for one salad. I thought maybe she'd throw I'm another salad or a little discount on the pizza but, no.   NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS LOCATIOM AGAIN. Ever.",

I had never heard of it before (I don't live in the area) so I decided to give it a shot. We had a hand-tossed pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms, and it was great. If any complaint, the sauce was a tiny bit bland, but I'm not a huge fan of heavy tomato sauces so that's almost a plus in my book (my husband was the one who views it negatively).   The pizza was also ready quickly and it came out HOT. I know where I'm going next time I want takeaway pizza in this area .",

    "text": "I live in a pizza Bermuda triangle where almost all my options are chain stores.  I'm outside the delivery areas of Intermezzo, Libretto's (both locations), Pure Pizza, etc. *shakes fist*  The few non-chain places that deliver (looking at you, Wolfman) fail to impress.  Jet's Pizza was my last ditch effort to find good delivery pizza.  The reviews were good, the website was decent, and I could order online.  Looked promising.  Everything went smoothly until it came time for the actual delivery.  My apartment complex is gated, so you have to ring a call box and be buzzed through.  The delivery guy reached me on the call box and I hit the number on my phone to allow him in. I am literally (proper use) the first building on the right after passing the gate.  It takes a car 10 seconds at most to get to us.  10 minutes go by.  No pizza.  No sign of the car outside my window.  15 minutes go by.  No pizza.  I call the pizza place and ask where their guy is.  The manager said he hadn't gotten into my complex and was still waiting outside.  I politely corrected him by saying I had successfully buzzed the dude through.  The manager would give him another call and see what was happening.  20 minutes passes.  I called the restaurant again.  The manager was getting irritated with me and gave me attitude, as if it were my fault that the driver couldn't find my apartment.  In an antagonistic fashion he finally barked, \"What, you want a credit?\"  At this point I gave up hope on getting a hot pizza.  Or a pizza at all.  \"Sure,\" I replied.  Manager confirmed the credit and hung up.  25 minutes later, I hear a knock at my door.  His excuse, \"My GPS took me the wrong way.\"  Normally I would have given him the benefit of the doubt, but in this case I had written turn-by-turn instructions on how to get to my house on the order.  I could see them printed out on the ticket he had in his hand.  The one he chose to ignore for 25 minutes.  A 10 second trip past a gate became a 25 minute odyssey of crappy customer service and lame excuses. It's a real shame because when I finally tried the pizza it wasn't bad for lukewarm deep dish.  Even with a credit waiting for me I'd be hard pressed to give them another chance.  Crap customer service always leaves a bad taste no matter how good the food.",

Jets is a deep-dish, greasy, buttery amazing pizza - the kind where the corners are the best part.  I've tried a few of their different pizzas, from round not deep dish, to regular deep dish, to the eight corner deep dish.  I've settled on the eight corner deep dish with pepperoni with the Turbo crust as the best one.  Turbo crust equals butter, garlic and romano.  Give Jets a try if you're looking for a deep-dish style pizza, but make sure you save me a corner slice.",

By \"sort of\", I mean that when I have a pizza craving, not much will stop me.  The location is easy to find, with this seriously massive window print of PIZZA. There's really no mistaking what this place serves. The neighbors are little odd, though. I went inside to pick up my online order, and I wasn't greeted or looked at for a good 5 minutes. I realize you're busy, but shouting a hi or something isn't very hard, and it'd make a customer feel better about just standing there awkwardly.  The guy was nice enough, and everything was straightfoward.  The pizza was good, but the calzone (Jet's Boat) had dough that was way too thin. We're talking 1/8th dough, 1/2 cheese, and the rest was meat. Where's the tasty Turbo dough?  I have to say I like the Matthews location better, but when It comes to pizza on the cheaper side, Jet's is still much better than Papa Johns or Pizza Hut or Dominos, etc.",

They're known for their \"Detroit\" style deep dish, which is essentially a Sicilian pie. The crust is so buttery, crunchy and delicious.  Make sure to order the 8 corner though instead of the regular deep dish. The 8 corner is actually 2 small pizzas (equals a large), but you get 8 corner pieces. Get it?!  The corner pieces have the biggest crust, which is the best part of the pizza (that's not usually the case!).  It also makes ordering easier when I want meat and my wife doesn't.  The salads are no joke either. We always order the Greek to share, which helps justify the meal!  Jet's usually has a living social deal going too, so check that out before ordering!",

There was NOTHING good about any of it:  1.  Service - it took ONE HOUR for the flunkie to show up at my door.  I called them after 50 minutes, and the girl just said \"he's on the way, and that's all I can tell you\".  She initially told me 35-40 minutes.  Then, the flunkie called me, lost, from within my neighborhood.  If this were 1986 and there were no cell phones of GPS units, I would understand.  Not today, though.  We were NOT off to a good start.   Oh, and I paid a $2.50 delivery charge for that hassle.  2.  Pizza - I am not convinced that they didn't just order a Domino's Pizza and put it in their own box.  It was IDENTICAL to Domino's, for the most part.  I think Domino's has better crust, though.  Plus, Jet's costs 1.5x more than Domino's.  3.  Wings - Awful.  Soggy.  They don't offer blue cheese, ranch, etc.  Enough said.  Any pizza place is a better alternative to Jet's.  I started regretting not ordering from Donato's the moment I hung up the phone from ordering it.  My regrets were valid.  Avoid this place - it sucks.",

I ordered my pizza online and not only do they have pizza but they have salads and sandwiches  too.  So my order consisted of a pizza with pepperoni and red onions and a greek salad.   First the salad.  It appears to be made when you order because the website said it came with beets and i didn't want to be beeted so I unchecked that option and voila, there were no beets on my salad.  The olives, maters, onions and feta were all fresh.  The dressing was decent for a pizza place.  The pizza is great for a takeout/delivery place.  It may replace my orders to Papa Johns.  They are definitely closer to me anyway.  The dough is amazingly light and reminds me of the dough at a place back home (Victor Emmanuels in Reading, PA)  but it's not there yet.  The cheese wss gooey and flavorful.  The sauce is what needs improvement.  It really lacked flavor.  And the onions were diced onions that just seemed to be spread in the middle of the pizza.    But overall this is a good pizza.  Definitely worth ordering again.",

Snarky phone guy asked us if we were sure we actually ordered online, then if we were sure we ordered from the Montford location, before retaking our order and telling us that we had to present our confirmation code at the door before getting our pizzas that we'd have to wait ANOTHER 45 minutes for... although our order was supposedly already prepared and out for delivery. We finally got our food around 9:30 pm.  I don't understand what took so long for such a simple order on a Sunday, or why we were met with such suspicion over our order. Did someone at Jet's get a little hungry and hope we wouldn't notice when dinner never came? These questions may never be answered, but one thing is for sure: if there's anything I love more than being hungry, it's having to jump through hoops for the food I've already been charged for!

I remembered getting Jet's Pizza coupons in the mail and decided to give them a try.  They do a fast delivery! I got a basic special: pizza, breadsticks, and wings. It was all so good...greasy like crazy, but delicious!   They have a great price point, deliver, and make my taste buds happy, what more can I say?",

    "text": "Jets pizza is a walk-up take-out pizza chain from the Midwest. I believe their pizza style is Detroit deep dish. It's heavy, greasy, and delicious. This is my go-to pig out pizza joint in Charlotte. I live just barely out of reach of the two closest locations to be able to get delivery so we always have to go pick it up. They do have our our order saved in their computer so every time we call we can just ask for the same thing as last time and be done with it.   We always get a large deep dish pizza with the \"turbo crust\", which is basically a garlic butter that's basted onto the crust before baking. The best part of the pizza is the crunchy, chewy crust and the turbo sauce makes it that much better. The pizza is very thick with a good amount of cheese. We can't help but also get the jets bread sticks and a few extra sides of ranch.   They do have other items like salads, wings, and such, but we've been hooked on the same item we've had since day one. I imagine everything is kind of the same fast food quality like the pizza.   You'll feel it the next day if you eat too much, but it's definitely worth it.",

He called Jet's and they said they were going to be closed 2pm-4pm bc manager had to go to the bank and buy more food. Larry's tone and attitude was condescending and rude. He didn't offer anything for the inconvenience. Never back again.",

I turned around and left as I'm a person of professionalism. I refuse to spend my money where customer service is lacking and where I'm not felt to be valued as a paying customer. Off to Arby's for mozzarella cheese sticks I guess. Such a disappointment and waste of time as I've always come to this Jets Pizza for over two years since I live very close.",

I sighed and said that was fine as I really wanted to try their deep dish Philly Cheesesteak pizza.  45 minutes later, there was a knock on my hotel room door, and I was taking delivery of my dinner.  I'll definitely be ordering from them again when I'm back in town on business and have a hankering for pizza.",

I ordered a small pizza, original crust, with half pepperoni & a garden salad.  Although Jet's looks to be known for their deep dish I thought I'd order the original crust to give them a try. The pizza was cooked to perfection. A nice pizza, perfectly chewy with a slight crisp crust, perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni! As for the salad, thank you Jet's! One thing about pizza delivery places is the fact they do not offer salads, why? Jet's does, and several options..Chef's, Garden & a few more. I chose the garden salad and it was fresh romaine mix with cheese, onions, tomatoes and more. A perfect pairing with the pizza!",

Jet's is known for it's deep dish style pizzas (small or large size ... medium is a regular round pizza) so make sure you order it that way. I had cheese, cheese & pepperoni, and  Hawaiian from here ... and honestly I think the plain cheese & pepperoni is the best. This is one of the places that simple is the best way to go, all specialty pizzas do is just complicate it and take away from the good & greasy heritage.   Salads are good -- fair amount of toppings and True to size. We ordered a small chef and it was plenty enough for a size salad for 4 people to go with our pizzas.   Cheesy bread was good ... nothing to write home about, however. Might try and get a different kind of bread next time, as they have a few to pick from.",

I usually don't just settle with a single topping pizza, but it was very tasty- And fresh! However, I recently ordered a custom pizza (mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and pepperoni) and it wasn't as good as the basic pizza. The pizza was made fresh and hot, but I didn't get the same orgasmic taste I got the first time ;-) and yes, I went there......  Next time I'll stick with the basics!",

My fiance liked it significantly more than I did: he's from the Detroit area and I'm from New England, so we have very different ideas on pizza!   I tried to put my thin-crust-love aside but I felt like Jets pizza was more of a breadstick with a tiny bit of sauce and some cheese. We also got a side of breadsticks, which was totally redundant.   Service could be a little more friendly... I'm kind of happy they don't have indoor seating!",

We called in for a deep dish chicken parmesan pizza, we weren't disappointed with the yummy deliciousness! The crust is crispy and thick while the pizza was given ample toppings and cheese. It took us forever to finish the huge pizza.   In addition to all of this, the cashier was a very nice lady who had sadly been harassed by a different Groupon user for having to pay tax. Dude, you should have read the fine print before blowing a gasket.   We will be returning, money well spent!",

Well, it does until you try to order anyway, then it claims they're closed.  Trying to call their number is met with a constant busy signal.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  Maybe they're having website trouble right?  I'd agree if this were a one time thing, but this happens all the time.  Things get even worse if you actually do manage to get through to them and anything goes wrong.  They have the rudest staff of any pizza place I've worked with.  Argumentative, snippy, and sarcastic are a few of the most apt descriptors for them.  Not to mention they will flat out lie to you and say that you're not in their delivery area if they don't feel like making your pizza.  I'm less than 5 miles from them in a very safe part of the city and got this line, after they'd already delivered to me twice before.  I've given them a couple of tries because I do love Jet's Pizza.  But it doesn't matter how good the product is if the customer service sucks.  I think I'll make the drive to the Matthews location if I get the craving for them again.",
