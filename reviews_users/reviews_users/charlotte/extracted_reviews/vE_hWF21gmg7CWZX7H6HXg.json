Staff is super friendly and welcoming. I've put a few of my friends on to this place, all of whom agree that this is the go-to place when craving great Caribbean food.

Walked in -aroma from the kitchen was like a familiar, exotic friend.  So comforting, and special.  Service was good, attentive.  What I liked was he told me what they had ready to go, first.  And he meant it.  That food was ready in 2 minutes!  I totally would have waited for something that needed fresh cooked.  I get it.  Stews, oxtail, and longer cooking items, you want that flavor cooked in.  so, they're ready to go.  Wings, fish, etc. you want fresh and hot.  It all works for me.  Ordered the large oxtail dinner.  There must have been 2 pounds of food in that take-out container!  The rice, oh that rice!  I could literally have that rice, as my only food, the rest of my life, and be content.  OMG it was soo good. flavor, texture, volume!!  spiced perfectly, such good balance!  The oxtail was magnificent.  Tender, toothsome, brilliant!  Loved it, and a good amount!  Had cabbage, and mac 'n' cheese as well.  Both good sides.  I will be going back tonight to order jerk chicken, and maybe one or more of their other selections, to share with family.  :)  (Enter the driveway in front of the small grocery mart, then turn to the left, toward the restaurant, to park.)",

The food was fresh, the cabbage wasn't soggy, the rice and peas weren't over cooked, and the white jerk chicken was tender with a mild flavoring which was very tasteful. I would recommend some extra sauce on the white jerk chicken but overall it was excellent. I would've rated this restaurant a 5 but I'm deducting a star due to me asking for double cabbage instead of rice and peas and cabbage. My husband and I were very satisfied will return in the future. Also I'm not sure if he over charged us, but next time I will ask for prices.",

My 5 star rating is enough to describe the taste.  What I really liked about this place was the amount of food they served.  I've heard from Jamaican friends that it's rare to find a large amount of oxtail in a meal, but that wasn't the case here.  So much food that I have to take home and eat later.  The price was okay, nothing too special to talk about in terms of money.  I recommend Lawrence Caribbean Restaurant if you're hungry and can eat a lot.",

I love the vibe of the place and the staff is courteous and friendly. If you want real Jamaican flavor, eat here - and bring your friends and family! And the jerk chicken is phenomenal!

I will eat if i really have the crave for it, beside that not at all. Its in the middle of nowhere, just that n a gas station,  dont ho there at night very scary, or during the day by yourself.",

I was able to eat the leftovers for another full meal! The gentleman at the counter suggested that I try the cream soda and I am glad I did. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it was a really good complement to the meal. The sides were tasty as well. My friend said her beef patty was great. I'm mad I didn't get one on my first time, but I'll make sure to not make that mistake again!   The parking was kind of confusing for us because the gate looked closed, so we turned around and parked on the other side using the next door store's parking lot to get to their lower lot. Trust me, it's worth figuring out how to get in here!",

I initially was going to go to Mama Caribbean's on Central Avenue until I scrolled and saw the reviews for Lawrence. This place is a bit of a drive from Concord, but it is more than worth it. Of all the Caribbean/Jamaican eateries that I have tried (Caribbean Hut, Quidley's, Tys Wings n Tings) this one is by far the best if not the best hands down. Don't debate me on this either. lol. Being from New York and of Haitian decent I know good Caribbean food and this is it. I had my employees who knew I was going to be on the west side and they all put in there order. Everyone was thoroughly pleased. Don't miss out on this great food and service, you will not regret it. Just a little hint skip the plain sorrel and grab the sorrel with rum.",

I am an extreme foodie and I know how good food should taste. I know because I have cooked and have sold food in the past. I purchased a few things but, the most important thing I want to talk about is the small dark jerk chicken I purchased. The chicken that I received was old! It wasn't fresh it was dry, next day chicken that was inedible. I have eaten plenty of jerk many ways. I have made it in the oven and on the grill. I have made my own rub and sauce from scratch. Trust what I am saying. I also had two bbq chicken wing plate for the kids and a plain as well. It isn't a traditional bbq sauce that they use. It literally taste like ketchup and vinegar (that's it)!. I also ordered two roti skins plain. One paratha (buss up) and dhal purie. $5 a piece which is rather high for them but I tried it anyway. The buss up was ok but, you can tell it was lacking salt and not the same day. The dhal purie was old and was in the freezer or fridge too long. Very disappointed the worst $37 I have spent. Can't make the same mistake twice.",

Picking up my mother n law from the airport last week I detoured up West Blvd and just about did a wheeley turning around when I saw Lawerence Caribbean Restaurant. My very authentic Guyanese mother n law was not excited. Between her cooking and living in NY where all ethnicities of food are plentiful she would have rather had Popeyes.   We ordered Oxtails, and Jerk chicken, collards and mac. I pretty much hate all Island mac because they put curry in the sauce. BEST mac ever, and no curry. My freakin Jerk---OMG!!  Just enough heat not over bearing. And the oxtails and gravy (because you must judge them separately)..AMAZING and AMAZING!! Only complaint, they could give you a bit more. But hey..I had to say something negative.   Finally we have our Island food back! And I'm sorry if one time during this article you said \"what about Anthony's\"... you have no absolutely no idea what Caribbean food taste like.

Real jerk chicken seasoned right shouldn't require a ton of gravy or sauce to achieve that carribean flare, Lawrence's delivered on keeping it simple and yummy . The prices were a bit steep , especially for lunch , $15 ... ehhhh I won't be visiting here often , but if I'm truly craving more then this will be my spot . Service was fast  & friendly, , the location a little weird for parking, I passed the entrance and had to do a u turn. I'm not sure if the patties are made fresh or frozen , but they looked good . I gotta try the oxtails next time , I hear they are the must try here . All in all , if you're looking for home cooked food with that island love , this is your spot .",

Other than the above, the flavors were good and I'll echo everyone's call about the portions being generous. At 8pm, the jerk chicken was dry and old from earlier in the day, but the plantains were so damn good they left me wanting more.  The setting and location of this place is odd, and the ambience is a no frills get your food, sit and eat then go type of place. I wouldn't recommend it for a group or dining in. Takeout is perfect.  All in all, I would give this place another try but earlier in the day. Do not come here past 7pm.",

The  dining room only has about four tables but there is a patio outside if you prefer al fresco.  I ordered a beef patty and the jerk chicken dinner. Total around $14.  The beef patty was the best I had in years. Enough spice to make you say \"whoa\" thinking it may be too spicy, but it never gets to a painful point. Perfect for me.  The jerk chicken dinner I got was small size, since this was my first go round with this business. It's a really generous portion and the food was delicious.

There is a ramp on the outside if you need handicap accessibility which is very considerate for the location and small area.   I loved that hand written menu boards because they show the authentic and original sense of the food.   The cashier lady was nice and accommodating. The man made sure we got our food promptly. Just a heads up, ask for the key for the restroom. I stood for 3 minutes knocking to see if someone was in there and another patron told me to ask for the key, lol.   My husband and I got 2 plates, one with oxtails, rice and peas, cabbage and plantains, with a side of macaroni and cheese. The other, curry goat, rice and peas, cabbages and plantains.   The oxtails were tender, perfectly cooked, and a good size. The curry chicken was flavorful with a hint of spicy. Cabbages were cooked just right and I love how they were sliced. The rice and peas, were ok, the gravy from the oxtails makes them more flavorful. The plantains were cooked perfectly and added just that little bit of sweetness.   We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed our meal. It was the perfect time, about 7:30 pm.  Surprisingly, we didn't have to deal with any insects sitting outside.   Overall, it was great, and my husband and I could only eat half of our food, and we saved it for later at the room. We will be eating here again soon!",

After some light perusing, I came across Lawrence on a Thursday and by Friday I was there.    When I arrived for breakfast (without checking the hours) they weren't open yet.  Unfortunately, I didn't make it back until late that night and the Ackee and Saltfish was sold out (which I knew it would be but wanted to try anyway...one can hope).   The cashier was very helpful and told me that I would be able to come back in the morning and she would have some ready.  I ordered dinner for me and my family instead.  Jerk Chicken, plantains, rice and peas.  Every thing was absolutely delicious but I could not get the Ackee and Saltfish out of my head.  So I woke up the next morning and headed over before running my errands for the day.  Sure enough when I got there, they were finishing up the batch.  I got my plate complete with boiled yam, green banana, dumpling (sadly--no fried dumpling) and fried plantains.   It was absolutely delicious and hit the spot.  Of course nothing can come close to fresh ackee right off the tree here in the states, but this was not far off and tasted like paradise.    I also got a fresh Ginger Beer while I was there that was out of this world.  Perfectly sweet and chocked full of ginger flavor.    It's so nice to know that whenever I'm home in Charlotte, I can have a slice of Jamaica that will hold me over until my next trip.    Note: They only serve Ackee and Saltfish on Fridays and Saturdays...so if that's what you want, be sure to plan out your visit accordingly.",

I have this love for Jerk Chicken and Oxtails, two of the most common things that could be done completely wrong... luckily, this place PASSED MY TASTE TEST - - with flying colors :) The spice on the Jerk Chicken was lovely, and the oxtails we perfect.  If you're looking for great Caribbean food, head to West Blvd in Charlotte and check them out !",

    "text": "This restaurant has been on my list for quite some time but I could never tell when it was open when I drove by it. My friend and I went on a Friday around 5pm. The parking lot is tiny. I'm guessing because it's set up more for taking food to go. My friend and I chose to stay and eat. There was a continuous flow of people  the entire time we were eating.    My likes: The staff were friendly. I ordered a small curry goat with Mac and cheese. It was plenty of food. My curry goat and plantain were delicious. We had the homemade ginger beers. I thought it was good but didn't taste like any ginger beer I'd ever had or much like ginger. It tasted like a juice I've never had before.  What made me give 3 stars instead of 4?  I ordered Mac and cheese instead of rice and peas. Somehow that was missed which ended up working out because I got to try  both. I didn't really care for the Mac and cheese, the rice and peas or cabbage. In addition, my friend ordered one of the fish dishes. I thought it was okay but did not compare to the curry goat. So, if I had not ordered the curry goat, I would have been unimpressed with my meal.   With that being said, would I go back? Yep. I'd like to try their wings and rum cake.",

    "text": "This review is Directly to the Owner in hopes it will improve your business. I came here on Wednesday night of this week after finding your business on yelp. The parking lot was empty and the business appeared dark so i called the number to see if they were open. A young lady answered i asked what time do you close her response i dont know. I asked what is your address her response i dont know. She asked someone in the background. Why doesnt your staff know the hours or address?well i soon discovered Why after entering the establishment. I enter and walked to the front counter to place  my order. There are no menus only a hand written erase board. I was NOT greet but instead a young girl stared like a deer on the headlights. I ordered escovitch fish but couldnt pronounce escovitch so i said the fish with the E word in front. She had noooooooo idea what i was talking about. Soon an older man and woman came to the rescue and told the cashier the name. So typical it is fried fish with hot spices and pickled veggies. On the sign it says $8 not $8+. So the man said a i have is small fish, i dont want to give you that. It will be $10 and i will give u a bigger fish. I agreed. My total was $10.82 i gave the cashier $11. She did NOT know how to count back change i had to tell her it was 18cent after she spent 2 minutes counting numbers in her head. This child needs to be school.learning math not behind a register.  Im sorry i feel so sorry for her the school system.failed her. An older lady brought my to go order to me and she asked if i was ok because she say i looked bothered i said yes but u need to get your cashier a calculator she doesnt know basic math her respond i know i know she has a calculator up there im sorry. Anyway i arrive home 15 minutes later to eat my food. It was Disgusting.  Omg. It tasted like hard double cardboard fried old fish with spicy sauce and a few pieces of picked veggies. I threw it away.  Note to management serve fresh hot fish not old fish Dont upcharge customer the fish when you sign doesnt say it Your cashier is the face of your company. U need to hire a new cashier asap. I bet your register came up short. She has 0 customer service skills didnt smile didnt greet me no sense of humor.  She does not represent your company well. Please do better.",

The beef stew was terrible. The meat was hard on the outside but had a mushy texture in the inside. It was a very low quality beef.  It almost had a processed meat texture. The flavoring wasn't desirable at all. I hate to knock a restaurant on one dish as maybe that is not one of their better dishes. It just happens to be my experience. I just don't understand all the great reviews?",

Also if you would like to see the review just go to YouTube in the search bar type in Hood Food Review.

I've been let down by ALOT of restaurants claiming to make Caribbean food. Today I decided to try the chicken roti as my first introduction to Lawrence's food and it did NOT disappoint! The curry chicken inside was delicious! Flavorful and spicy just the way I love my curry chicken! They also offered the chickpea casing! I was so excited about that because most places that claim to make roti only offer the flour tortilla type of casing. It was so yummy! Definitely excited to try something else now.",

Even though the wind outside is brisk, I am immediately transported to Ocho Rios along the north shore.  Hell, yea, I'm off to a good start.   I ordered the oxtail 'cause my Yelp buddies suggested it.  Wow.  A very dark gravy added to the wonder of tender meat, with little bits of  gelatin from hours of low-n-slow cooking like Mom did when she had all day to linger in the kitchen.  Rice, beans, plantains, and cabbage . . . each well prepared even though the place is small and the food served humbly  in takeouts.   My advice?  Come here for your dose of Jamaican cuisine.  Who knows?  They're so close to the airport, you might get an itch and take the next flight to Montego Bay.  Give 'em a whirl!",

Exit almost immediately to West Blvd. and settle in for a couple miles. After 5-minutes or so, watch for Lawrence Caribbean to appear on your left. It's a colorful, little hut that will immediately make you wish you were on an island somewhere.   Once inside, you order at the window and receive your food packed to go. If you want to stay and eat, you can either sit at one of the few tables inside or outside on the patio, where there are a few more seats. Service was very fast and friendly.   I went with the small jerk chicken (white meat), with cabbage, collard greens, and plantains. Everything was delicious! The collards had some spice to them and the cabbage was well seasoned. The jerk chicken was moist and the sauce that accompanied it was fresh and spicy. The real star of the meal were those plantains though... Man, I could eat those plantains every day, for breakfast, lunch and dinner!   They had a sign on the door advertising delivery through Postmates. I have a sneaking suspicion lots of deliveries from Lawrence are in my future!",

    "text": "My guy showed me this little gem a while back and to be honest I cant believe I haven't written a review yet! I love this place! definitely more of a take out type place but its absolutely perfect for when I want delicious Caribbean food and can take it to the comfort of my couch however if you would like you can eat there they have a few small tables inside and a patio outside with some tables and great music playing. They have all the staples of curried and stewed beef chicken and fish and sides like mac and cheese rice and peas collards and cabbage with of course plantains that you MUST try. I could eat here multiple times a week and I think last week I did if I'm honest. I am more of a veggie plate kinda girl here as I cannot get enough of their delicious sides and definitely make sure that you ask for gravy on your rice and peas its a must.  Everything is very fairly priced and the guys behind the counter are so nice and always happy to see people come in.  Parking is in a small shared lot with a convenience store but Ive never had trouble getting a spot.  I definitely recommend this place for any night of the week and at the moment they are also running a check in special so check it out its delicious!",

    "text": "Great find near my hotel at Charlotte airport.  So glad that I picked up food from here as opposed to eating at the hotel restaurant.  I ordered the jerk chicken and the curried goat - both...  Both were absolutely wonderful.  There was way more food that I could eat, but I wanted  to taste both, since they are two of my favorite dishes from the Caribbean.  If I had to pick, the goat was likely better than the chicken, but both were wonderful.  The restaurant had a few small tables, but looks like they do most of their business as takeout.  It smells amazing when you walk in the door too!  The server, who may likely have been the owner, was super friendly!  Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to comment on the cleanliness.  It was absolutely immaculate inside.  Clearly the owner/manager really cares about the restaurant and the food that they serve to their customers.  I will absolutely return here on my next visit to Charlotte.  I might even make the trip if I have a long enough layover between flights...",

It provides a different experience then any other establishment in it's area. There is complimentary high speed Wi-Fi services along with a High Def Television to view while waiting to place a order or receive your food. The environment is very soothing & relaxing with the selection of Caribbean music that plays both indoors & outdoors (There is a nice outdoor patio area). Also, the food is prepared where it is all visible to the customers. The level of customer service is very professional & all the food I've ever ordered has been prepared in a timely manner. In addition I would recommend anyone visiting to try the chicken patties.",

I ordered a large oxtail dinner with 2 beef patties. First let's start with my initial impression when I opened the box. I had a ton of rice and very little oxtail. Already I'm feeling disappointed but was hoping the flavor would be so good that I could overlook that. Nope! Again disappointed... The rice was bland and dry. If it wasn't for the gravy from the oxtails it would not have been edible. It tasted like cardboard. Now as far as the oxtails, they had potential to be really good  but they were not seasoned well. With the right amount of seasoning they could have been really good. The larger oxtails were also kinda tough. Lastly, these were the worst beef patties I have ever had. I would definitely not recommend this place. This was really a waste of 20 buck. DON'T DO IT!!",
