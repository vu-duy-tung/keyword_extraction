The noodle dishes all taste the same to me and aren't as good as the dumplings (7.5/10) but are a great side w lunch combo. Note: bring water as you're in for a spicy experience!",

Easy pickup that Wednesday at NoDa's Company Store, but she offered free delivery. $12 per dozen includes a tangy soy sauce for dipping. Preparation is super easy - drop them in boiling water; when they float they are ready. Served them with white rice and sauteed vegetables and my dinner companions were thrilled! I will order them again.",

    "text": "I decided to try ordering from their food truck today.  They had a lunch special for $12 which was noodles and 6 dumplings.  The food smelled wonderful.  The dumpling sauce was a bit spicy to me. Fortunately I like spicy food.  Unfortunately there was cilantro in it and I'm very sensitive to cilantro.  Even a little piece will ruin the entire dish for me so I was disappointed with that.  I'm not sure if it's possible to get it without the cilantro but it may be worth asking because it was otherwise delicious.  For the noodles they were out of everything but the Dan Dan noodles.  When I took a bite they were good but a bit dry.  I then realized the sauce was on the bottom of the dish so I mixed everything up.  Once I did that the noodles were delicious but a bit too spicy even for me, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately the rest of the day my stomach has been very upset (it still is even 12 hours later).  I think it may have been all the spice or perhaps an oil they used that bothered my stomach. I'm not sure I'd try it again but if I ever do, I'd definitely order something different.",

They pull in on the other side of the offices which means an embarrassingly short drive or a really long walk so I usually opt to dine in and save some nickels but it was so springy and dumplingy out yesterday that I had to make the trek. A happy face helped me with my lunch selections and we exchanged a small pile of cash for a page-o-matic, a few minutes later food calls and then I'm heading back to the lab with a sac-o'-goodies: Dan Dan Noodles plus Pork n Chive dumplings we're oh so good and lived up to the hype: pop the top and jam a fork under the noodles, stir it roundy round and let the flavors mingle while sharing some dumpley goodness. Yea chili sauce!! Soft but firm noodles are so good and so full-feeling; shredded meats, nuts, and green bits hanging out in hot sauce making the most of our time together. ...if I had a rice maker for at work this would be perfect.",

The flavor was very good, but there was a little kick to it that I was not expecting. They are smaller dumplings than other places as well. I think they come with 10 dumplings, which was a decent size - although I could have eaten a few more or even split another with a friend. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and I look forward to being able to try the sweet pork dumplings next time.",

The last time we had dumplings, we went to Yummi and bought a banh mi just to soak up the extra sauce. The time before that, we put the lid back on the tin and brought the extra sauce home with us. It's an actual crime to just throw away the sauce you can't manage to sop up with dumplings.   Oh, yeah. The dumplings are to die for, too. ;) Super flavorful and always stuffed with tasty, fresh fillings like chicken and mushrooms, pork and chives, etc. And, don't even get me started on the buns. A great option to soak up the extra sauce as well, btw.   If you're lucky enough to be at the same place at the same time as the Dumpling Lady, pay her a visit!",

    "text": "The people running the truck are nice. I remarked how I'd been wanting to try the dumplings for over a year, and he asked how I'd heard about them.  Word of mouth and Yelp, of course.  I told him I'd been looking for a good dumpling ever since I left DC.   Which isn't entirely accurate. There dumpling place wasn't in DC. It was in Rockville, MD. And I would make my way out of the district to the outskirts of the capital beltway for the wondrous dumplings and amazing chili sauce they served.  What caught my eye about this particular purveyor of dumplings is that The Dumpling Lady serves the dumplings in tins of chili sauce.  I adore chili sauce. I wouldn't say I am obsessed with eating spicy food. I don't purposely go out searching out food made from Carolina Reaper Pepper. I do enjoy spicy foods, however.   The gentleman who took my order had asked if I liked spicier foods, I said yes, he said that he would have them make it spicier, which I appreciated.  I ordered two orders of dumplings. Pork & Chives and Chicken & Shrimp.  I ate the Chicken & Shrimp first. I was dumbfounded. This sauce is great if you don't like spicy foods. The flavor of the sauce falls a bit on the bland side for me. I ate the dumplings without a drink nearby. It was unnecessary. I wondered if I was doing something wrong.  I tried the Pork & Chives.   Oh.   Here was the spice. Only one order of dumplings was 'spicy.' For reference, the hotter version of their chili sauce is less spicy than the Sweet Heat dipping sauce that you can get at Popeyes that accompanies chicken tenders. The heat might be more comparable to Texas Pete or Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I was mildly disappointed. I still did not need a drink.  I did not enjoy the flavor of the Pork & Chives dumplings, either. They used a certain spice in their ground pork mix. It reminded me vaguely of licorice. I am not a fan of licorice. This spice was not present in the Chicken & Shrimp dumpling. Maybe it's supposed to taste like that. And people enjoy that flavor profile. I do not. That's okay. Variety is the spice of life and such.  The texture of the dumpling was adequate, though the dumplings were a bit on the small side.   All in all, a very average dumpling experience.  I'll probably go back if I get a fierce craving for dumplings and the stars align that it happens to be on a Saturday (where they are at NoDa Company Store from 11:30AM - 8:00PM regularly, as of the time of this review.)   I was left wanting.  More spice. Larger dumplings. Less licorice flavor (Star anise? Fennel, maybe?)",

I ordered (dumplings, of course) and received one of those things you hold on to so they can buzz you when the food is ready). I was told about 10 minutes. I went inside the establishment to use the restroom. While washing my hands, I hear this noise that sounds like someone's cell phone. It wasn't mine so I am looking at the other patron. She is looking at me. I feel a buzzing on my person. I am searching and searching, wondering what the loud noise could be (almost like an emergency alert). Finally, I find it and realize, oh, that's my food; it's ready! That was an experience. In any case, the dumplings were delicious. They were $10 and you get five big ones if I recall correctly. It was plenty for my stomach and I can't wait to get more! BTW, service was great with friendly conversation; they patiently helped me decide on my selection.",

They are melt in your mouth good!  They also offer a few noodle dishes as well and they are equally great, but my fav will forever be the sweet pork belly!

Seriously, right now they're making around 2,000 a day.   She gets all her proteins from local farms. Dumpling wise, I really don't think you can go wrong with any of them. They are all delicious. The sauce is stupid good. During week day lunches, they usually have a noodle and dumpling combo option. Even when there's not a combo option on the weekends, I'll still order both dumplings and noodles. Hey, sometimes you need two lunches (who am I kidding, I always end up eating all of it the minute I get home).  The best way to find them is on their Instagram or Facebook. They post the schedule each week. The Dumpling Lady is also available to cater private events, parties, and corporate lunches.",

The best way to find the Dumpling Lady is to follow her on social media (Facebook and Instagram). Every week they constantly update their locations so you know where they'll be Monday through Saturday.   We decided to give it a try on a Saturday when I got out of work. They we posted up at Noda Company Store which is also a fantastic spot for drinks. Naturally, we tried the dumplings. I tried the Vegetable and he tried the Chicken and Mushroom.  I didn't realize that the dumplings were served with a spicy sauce. I went back to inform them I couldn't eat the dumplings because I can't eat anything spicy. She felt terrible! Made me new ones with out the sauce, didn't charge me and let me keep the original dumplings (which my husband ended up eating.)   First and foremost, let's talk about the stellar customer service. She took the blame and made things right, even when I offered to pay for the new food. The service is very efficient...unless that place is packed, expect a slight delay. Most people are understanding since these dumplings are made to order, it's a two person operation and they are in a food truck.   The food....oh my gosh y'all these dumplings are incredible!!! They are fresh, light and so so so tasty! They don't just have dumplings either. A different visit, my husband had a noodle dish that he won't stop talking about. If you like spicy food, this is right up your alley!",

Our order consists of pork and chive dumplings, chicken and mushroom, and spicy noodles. The dumplings has no flavor at all the skin was to mushy in my opinion. Both dumplings just tasted pretty much similar. I prefer the the chewy texture of a dumpling. The sauce on both dumpling has no wow factor it was chili sauce and very oily. I wish dumpling lady had also a sauce option like an ginger base soy sauce. Both dumplings were drenched in her chili oil sauce.  For the noodles wow I never had this happen to me be before my tongue went numb after chewing on a herb leaf. I could not identify what kind of herb it was it was a tad minty. The noodles itself also lacks good flavor it was just drenched in the same sauce as the dumplings with the licorice minty flavor from the herb that made my tongue go numb. I was scared to finish the noodles or dumplings after my tongue going numb. At that point I avoided any of that green herb both in my noodles and dumplings. We hardly finished the dumplings or meat in the sauce. Everything was luke warm nothing was piping hot. There is a limited vegetarian options. Service was good the man was very attentive and kept composure it was pretty busy.",

If you ever have the chance to go, I highly recommend you try them.

They have a very mild to medium heat which is a perfect match for the flavor of the dumplings. Next to try are the noodles!",

    "text": "I've had a loving relationship now with The Dumpling Lady, and have spent many weeks trying to duck out of class or work early, or even changing my schedule to go out of my way to stop and try the whole selection of dumplings. Now that I finally have, I would love to give the truck five stars.  The dumplings are wonderful, each with a unique flavor profile, which made it exciting to order each time. My favorite, and a must-have is the Sweet Pork Belly dumplings. It is my understanding that these are also the most popular, which doesn't surprise me at all.   I've always been treated well by the staff, and they have been super helpful, especially for decision making in my earliest experiences. The only thing keeping me from giving The Dumpling Lady five stars is accessibility. On more than a couple of occasions I have attempted to get dumplings in the last 45 minutes of posted service and arrived to a closed truck, or no truck.   Really though, this is easily one of the best dumplings you can find in Charlotte.",

We ordered the spicy beef noodles and the pork and chive dumplings. Both were fantastic! The dumplings were made perfectly and so flavorful. That sauce. The spicy noodles were definitely spicy but it was that, make you wanna come back for more, kind of spice.   I really appreciate them giving us a pager to know when our food is ready, opposed to having to listen for your name.  I can't wait to try other options!",

Ordered three different types: pork belly, shrimp/chicken and crab/chicken. I'm not particularly fond of super hot spicy food so I told her to keep the spices mild. Ho Lee Sheet ! Even the mild dumplings tore me a new one! Had to drink a quart of milk just to neutralize the flaming cauldron inside my stomach. Lovely lady and all but Jeezus!",

We ordered the pork & chives dumplings, the pork belly  zha jiang noodles, the pork belly steamed bun, and the chicken & mushroom dumplings. While none of the food tasted bad, it wasn't the best either. The dumpling skin was the right thickness but the actual flavors were a bit bland compared to your traditional homemade dumplings - the sauce helped a lot. The pork belly bun was a bit misleading as it's not the typical pork belly you'd think of - more like minced pork bun, not the fatty slice that people are used to. The zha jiang noodles were probably my favorite of the night - just the right heat and flavor. One of our friends ordered the spicy beef noodles and beware of the Szechuan spice! It can kill your tastebuds if you're not used to it!",

Went inside and asked the employees where the truck was and they said she called and said she was on the way an hour ago. Lennyboy doesn't serve food so we gad no other choice but to leave.  This is the 2nd time she didn't show up at a certain location. Im done trying to try this truck out.",

The noodles were flavorful, fresh, & Spicy!  TIP: Heed her \"heat rating chart\". This dish is 5/5. Hot!  The dumplings were definitely my favorite!  Delicious! The reviews about the AMAZING sauce are True. You will find some way to save/use it. Also spicy, but you can't stop eating them. That's why people complain that there are \"only\" ten dumplings. Any other place, ten would be plenty. Not these. You end up just devouring them!!  And people early to event confirmed that everything is fresh & handmade. They watched them make everything. Wow! The only reason for the 4 stars is because I agree with my fellow Yelpers that SOMETHING should be provided with the dinner service. At lunch she serves rice with your meal. Dinner should also come with a side to help cut the heat and utilize that phenomenal, left over sauce. At least offer something on menu to add. But at $9, we should already get a little scoop of rice.",

    "text": "We had heard a good bit about The Dumpling Lady. To be fair, we are not exactly fans of the food truck scene overall, but we are fans of Asian food in general, and dumplings specifically, and had an afternoon to spare, so thought we would give it a go.  The first thing, as with many food trucks, is figuring out where they are on any given day.  With The Dumpling Lady, I searched on Google and found their web page. Right there on the home page, I found a schedule. It mentions their normal schedule for each day. Unfortunately it does not include Sunday, and we were out on a Sunday.  However, there is a mention of both Instagram and a locations tab. Since I was already on the web site, I checked the locations tab. No luck there, still no Sunday. But it does mention Facebook as well as Instagram. I checked Facebook quickly, and it looked like most of those were actually coming from Instagram, so off I went.  There I found the standard pictures of food, as well as a number of scheduley-looking posts (looking sort of like a menu). Seeming like a good place to start, I pulled up the most recent one at the time. This is important.  On that day, it was this one: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FBjBGvytHLdi%2F&s=95704c5dcaae109fc83c5e40e1f1f8181552fe172efa2351fe243b22b88318ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/p/BjBGvytH...</a>  You can also see a copy here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fibb.co%2Fcrj1Ky&s=6df6c75d8cf763ce1f48cb5111554b7b61e9844324d93c86fd0e92de1e439c45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ibb.co/crj1Ky</a>  And I have uploaded a copy to the business photos here on Yelp, and to the last two I have added an arrow to show the time at Triple C. Why be so detailed? Simply to point out - mostly to myself, perhaps - that I'm not completely insane.  Next up: The waiting (perhaps abnormal).  After running some errands in the morning, we arrive at Triple C at a bit after 2pm. At the time, the truck was there, with a single person in the back, however it was not open for orders. After checking to verify that they are not open yet, and being told it will be \"about fifteen minutes\" - which would be around 2:30 - we head inside and get a drink and proceed to wait.  Since it's a nice day - not yet that hot - we sit and observe. We notice that there is indeed a single individual inside, working to (do stuff). There are a bunch of folks, and a few dogs, hanging out enjoying the day. While we are not what you would call regulars, it does seem that more than a few of them are waiting on the food, since only a small percentage are actually drinking - and many are watching the truck.  It is during this time that we find out at least one couple has been there since 12:30 (only because they mention it both now and after placing their order at the window a short while later). Another person nods their agreement that they have been waiting a while, but does not seem to have been there as long.  Sometime between our arrival and 2:30ish, another person arrives and begins helping in the truck. Not sure if this person was there before and returned (maybe went to get things and came back) or only now arrived for the first time. At least it seems that we're getting closer. Around the promised time - in person, not online - the window opens. But orders take a few minutes more because the menus have to be written on the chalkboards.  And now: The ordering (probably fairly standard, except a small issue).  Eventually, we get to the point where we can order. There are menus on the chalkboards. There are printed menus that you can read when you get to the front that explain items in detail. The staff can explain in even more detail if needed. This actually goes fairly well, and the line moves quickly.  This is where we hear (again) that one couple has been there for a couple of hours. Not sure why, unless they just really, really, like dumplings, but that's their choice. I don't wait a couple of hours for much of anything.  Regardless, after ordering, you pay on a Square-type of terminal, and normally would get a pager-type device to notify you when your order is ready. This is similar to if you're in a restaurant waiting for your table to be ready. Only this isn't working. So they take your name instead.  The verdict?  If it was all about the pork dumplings, you'd be looking at four stars all day long. Perhaps something strange like a 3.8, but I'd round up without batting an eye. Unfortunately the chicken dumplings and the beef noodles add little, and in fact likely take away from the experience.  Enough to drop all the way to a three star? Maybe, maybe not.  Throw in the waiting and the issues with the scheduling and it's a different story.  On a side note, I did mention originally about getting up at the \"crack of noon\". Perhaps that rubbed them the wrong way. I make that comment - and I am sure, others - off the top of my head a lot and maybe it rubs a lot of folks the wrong way. If it did, I apologize.  One more note. Qian sent me a message to say this was the first week they changed their schedule from 12:30 to 2:00pm. Unfortunately they forgot to post this anywhere. The apology is certainly welcome. But if you depend on an online source to get an update, and there is no update? That sorta stinks.",

I got the sweet pork belly, and it was so delicious. The sauce that they are covered with is the final touch. For the most bang for your buck, it's about $13 for the noodle and dumpling combo and is soooo filling. I make it a habit to visit on Fridays for lunch uptown.",

She was very friendly and offered suggestions of some of her favs. The food came out pretty fast too. I ordered the chicken and shrimp dumplings as well as the spicy beef noodles. The dumplings were definitely some of the best I have had just make sure you don't have on a nice shirt because you will have red oily spots all over you (or was that just me being hungry). The spicy beef noodles were really good but definitely spicy and I love spicy.  I would absolutely recommend this truck if you were see it around town. Can't wait to try all of the other menu items especially the other dumplings.",

    "text": "The dumpling lady consistently delivers! Honestly, I cannot remember having had better dumplings in the past few years.  I used to be all about the shrimp & chicken but I have found a new favorite in the chicken & mushroom. They are something that I can find myself eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  What sends them over the top is the homemade chili oil that coats them. I have even seen people drink that sauce directly from the pan!  The normal menu consists of multiple flavors of dumplings and noodles. For the lunch combo, you can combine one flavor of dumpling and one type of noodle for $12. Normally, one portion of dumplings go for $9. Just note the lunch combo portion of dumplings is reduced to six from the usual nine, however, the noodle portion remains the same.  Thanks to the ever-growing popularity of the dumpling lady, I see the truck popping up at more and more places. Most consistently, the truck can be found at Noda Company Store....and, thankfully, at my business park every other week! The most surprising fact I read about the actual Dumpling Lady is that she recently moved from China to Charlotte a little over three years ago.  The truck has Instagram, facebook, and twitter pages so you can keep up with the schedule and menu. Once you find this truck, you'll soon learn why there are so many fans!",

If you are granted the pleasure to pull up to one of the many lunch offerings around town, do so and pair your dumplings with either rice or noodle option. Now when it says \"spicy\" be cautious that Asian and Indian spice levels are not to be compared to American levels of spicy. This is one of my favorite lunch options at one Wells Fargo center. Make time in your schedule to stop by.",

I have been searching and finally found her, so I had to grab some to go.     Let me apologize in advance on the picture that I attached as this was the following day.  As I said earlier, we had just finished a big dinner right before we stumbled upon her so I didn't get to enjoy till the next day.    We tried the Seeet Pork Belly dumplings and the taste was AWESOME!!!!   Had a good amount of spice to it for that extra kick.  Dumplings had good consistency which is something that you don't always find.    The next time that I find her, I will eat them on the spot and not wait.  Go forth and conquer.",

    "text": "Rain, shine, snow on the ground. Didn't matter..on Friday if this truck was parked outside Wells Fargo One during lunch hours it's #dumplingfriday! These dumplings are completely amazing. The flavor is REAL, it's authentic, bright with cilantro, zesty, fresh from bits of spring onion, spicy with chile oil but light and delicate enough to perfectly coat each precious dumpling. The dumplings are served in orders of 10. Which is filling for lunch, sometimes I've order a small white rice from a nearby Chinese restaurant to sop up the extra sauce and balance out the spicy.  I've tried the veggie, shrimp & chicken, chicken & mushroom and sweet pork belly. All but the sweet pork belly have a thicker, more constructed rice dumpling wrapper. The pork belly has a softer, yellow, thin dumpling wrapper -that plus the fattier pork belly's ability to soak up the sauce flavor better makes the sweet pork belly dumplings my fav. and go to! The lines for lunch are usually long but it's always worth it. The cashiers have restaurant style buzzers to let you know when your food is ready, they also have umbrellas available to use while you wait if it's raining .  The dumpling lady deserves all the awards, the store front and cult following she gets! Also try the berrynade it's house-made fruity lemonade with fresh assorted minced fruit in it,  it goes well with all the dumpling spiciest!",

I really enjoyed the pork and chive dumplings, but if you are not into those strong \"traditional\" Chinese flavors, the chicken & shrimp and pork belly dumplings are good as well.  They have an awesome lunch combo that lets you order a smaller portion of noodles + 6 dumplings for $12, which is a nice deal if you want to try multiple things. I died a little on the inside from the spiciness of the Dan Dan Noodles, but again...it was worth the pain.",

Try to come a bit early because those sell out fast. People order up to 4 plates sometimes. I ended up getting the chicken and shrimp. The owner even let me try the sauce to make sure it was not too spicy for my child. (I ended up getting him a child's noodles with some soy sauce). The wait time wasn't long and it was a very pleasant experience. Very sweet girl! Needless to say there were no left overs. I'm glad I got to try it and would I try to catch the truck again. Yes!

The dumplings were good but the wrapper was thick and the sauce too oily. The shrimp in the dumpling did not taste fresh. For better tasting dumplings, try the Dim Sum restaurant for weekend lunch. As for the noodles, what can I say...I've had chili chicken noodles in China several times and they are super spicy but have a layered, flavorful heat. The Dumpling Lady's version is smack in your face, palate deadening heat. It had dried cayenne peppers as well as jalapenos, something never used together in this dish in Asia. Save your taste buds and skip the chili chicken noodles. Next time I'll order something from the Taco Truck instead.",

    "text": "I love dumplings and it's hard to find great dumplings.These really are some of the best dumplings in town, but the sauce is what brings it to the next level. However, if you don't like spicy food, you may want to ask for them without sauce. It's a chili oil with hints of ginger and scallions. I ordered the pork and chive, but honestly this flavor blends in with the sauce. The dumplings aren't too doughy and have a good bit of meat.   There's a lunch combo which combines your choice of noodles and six dumplings for $12. For my noodle selection, I tried the spicy beef because I love spicy food. I've had the burning noodles here before, but to me the spicy beef had more heat. The noodles themselves have a great texture. Again the sauce is great and very similar to the dumpling sauce, but very spicy. I took in a couple of peppercorns which had my mouth on fire. I like the freshness of the carrots and cucumber, but it was missing the papaya that was listed on the menu description.  The flavors overall played well together.   My only critique is the time it takes to get food. I caught them at Well's Fargo uptown during peak lunchtime at noon. I waited about 25 minutes to order and then another 10 minutes for food. I like that they had pagers so you don't have to wait for your name to be shouted.  It was a nice day and I like that this location has plenty of tables on the plaza. I barely had time to eat on my hour lunch break since it's about a ten minute walk back to my office.   You're not going to find food this authentic in any area take out restaurant.",

These are by far one of the best dumplings I've had! These are made fresh daily and you can taste how fresh the ingredients are. Oh and the sauce they served them in is FIRE!!! If you enjoy spicy food then the Dumpling lady is a place for you! One thing to note is the dumplings is not enough as a meal which is why I got the burning noodles as well. Never tried cold noodles before but the spicy level in these was a great balance! Definitely will be coming back!",

The line was LONG so I was excited to see so many people into these dumplings. I tried the pork and chives and sweet belly pork dumplings which I split with a friend, and were both pretty good but the portion was NOT worth the money. For about $10 you get one order of 8 dumplings, which sounds good, but they are probably half or less the size of dumplings you'd get at a normal Chinese food restaurant. I'm a pretty small woman known to \"eat like a bird\" and after eating 8 dumplings and a side of rice, I was still starving and had to go home and cook myself more food. Will not be returning. I'll stick with the normal 6 dumplings appetizer for $5 at my usual Chinese spot which actually fill me up.",

    "text": "Delicious Asian cuisine with the convenience of a food truck? Yes please!  My good friend Chris, along with most of the Charlotte Yelp community rants and raves about this little truck and after having finally sampled their fare myself I can see why. They were part of a food truck rally at Resident Culture last week and while there were certainly people waiting for every truck The Dumpling Lady had the distinction of longest line.   Their menu has a few noodle dishes as well, but the obvious draw is the dumplings. They had 5 varieties to choose from when I visited: Pork and Chives, Chicken and Mushrooms, Shrimp and Chicken, Sweet Pork Belly, and Veggie. With a price of $10 for 10 dumplings you'd be hard pressed to find a better bang for your buck, especially of this quality. You can even buy a dozen dumplings pre-frozen right from the truck (for a similar price) and take them home for later!   I ordered the Pork and Chives myself, but I also managed to try one of the Pork Belly my friend had. The Pork and Chive dumplings were delicious. It's the kind of dish where you could easily eat two dozen before realizing what you did. Relatively small but packed with flavor they come served in a round tin foil container with an excellent spicy dipping sauce soaking the bottom. I've had a lot of dumplings over the years, so I don't know I can definitively say these are the best I've ever had, but they are very good. That sauce on the other hand is absolutely the best dumplings accompaniment I've ever tasted. The Pork Belly was somehow richer and lighter at the same time, not giving off the same slow heat of the Pork and Chives. I think the fact that it didn't come drenched in the spicy sauce is what made it stand out as different, but both were excellent. Lets be honest, it's hard to be unhappy with well seasoned pork, whatever form its in.   A favorite to be sure. I'll keep my eyes open for that little red truck at any future food trucks rallies I visit.",

I check the dumpling lady's schedule every week because if I go longer that 7 days without those delicious spicy morsels of joy, I start going through withdrawals.   The sweet pork belly is usually the most popular item, but is limited so it goes quick. My go-to is the pork and chives dumplings, with an order of the beef noodle dish. It's too much food for me, but the noodles keep surprisingly well in the fridge. The spice level is perfectly hot. Enough that it keeps you coming back for more even though your nose is running.   I haven't had the opportunity to try everything on the menu yet, but trust me I will. Pro-tip: She also sells her dumplings frozen too, (with a side of that delicious sauce of course). I have a bamboo steamer at home and if I'm in a pinch it satisfies my craving.   Their locations change on a weekly basis, so check their Instagram for their weekly schedule but two of my favorite places to catch up with the dumpling lady is at the NoDa Company Store on the weekends, or at Resident Culture on a Friday Night.",

After my meal here today, I think Dumpling Lady is not only Charlotte's best Chinese restaurant (which is a low bar to clear) but one of Charlotte's best restaurants of any kind. The noodles had a strong and complex combination of flavors, and were nicely cooling on a hot day. The dumplings kind of fell apart in my chopsticks, but were also delicious, especially the sauce. I believe that both dishes had the mala (hot and numbing) flavor that's unique to Sichuan cuisine.   I'm already looking forward to when I can come back here for another lunch. Too bad the lunch combo is only available from 11 to 2 on weekdays.",

We ordered a few different types of dumplings, and we loved everything we tried. The dumplings were perfectly cooked and the sauce was bomb.   They give you a buzzer when you order so they can buzz you to come back to pick up your food. This was a nice touch as we didn't have to stand around by the food truck waiting!!",

    "text": "Yes, I know I am late to The Dumpling Lady game, but I finally had the opportunity to taste their dumplings this weekend.  With Food Truck Friday they are located at different breweries each Friday so I got lucky this week.   After looking over the menu items I was so torn, but I decided to get a basic/staple dish for my first try. I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Dumplings.  I received my pager and waited. Luckily for me I didn't have to wait too long, due to the fact it was a rainy night...with Hurricane Florence moving in.  Ten Dumpling come with each order. They were cooked to perfection, had an amazing sauce, with a little kick. They are so light I will definitely order something else next time because I was still a bit hungry.  Overall, service was good and food was amazing! I definitely look forward to seeing them again and trying some more of their options.",

The only downfall is that you aren't able to change the spice levels on the dishes (it's they're way of keeping the Sichuan taste), but it makes it difficult for people who can't eat spicy to enjoy the noodles.",

I feel like I should give it another try because I heard so many great things about this place but didn't feel as if I got the same experience. I have been tracking this truck downnnn for as long as I can remember and the time and location conflict just never seemed to match until one day! I was off and realized they were pretty close to where I was for lunch. I drove over to them so eager to try and so excited that today was the day! I waited in line and observed their cute quaint set up. I realized they pride themselves in the quality of their ingredients which I am a sucker for because you can't go wrong with local or fresh. I ordered the veggie dumplings and the yin bin ran mian vegetarian style because I saw the spice level and was in love. They were very quick in giving me my order and I quickly drove home to try. Now the veggie dumplings were definitely a hit but what may have ruined it for me was the noodles. They were extremely bland but with spice. I loved the heat it gave me but there was no flavor. I would probably go back and try another dish to see if it was just that particular one or all of the noodles as a whole.",

Not only do we follow her on Facebook, we follow her around town and have tried so many new places and breweries only because we followed them there.  I chanced upon their food truck when we decided to meet with some friends for lunch and we have been hooked since! Their dumplings are obviously the bomb. We love all the options they have. Pork, chives, mushrooms, chicken, shrimp... give me all of them! The sauce is addicting though... seriously. For my son we get dumplings without the sauce but we still get the sauce on the side to save it for later.  In addition to the dumplings, we do also like their noodles. The yan bin ran mian (I don't know if I spelled it right but I just call it \"yan bin ramen\") is my favorite, as are the chili chicken. Yum. Writing about it is making me drool.  And now they are getting a more permanent location so I hope they still keep coming to breweries. Do try them out if you like real spicy Chinese potstickers.",

Honestly not much flavor, but that could be because I had no idea what I was eating. I got the chefs special, chicken and shrimp, and pork and scallion. I had no idea which was what, because the girl at the front had no desire of telling me what was what when I tried to ask. Considering I left 20% on a Togo order. I also got the spicy beef noodles and one other kind with Bok choy in it. Noodles were very bland and the broth was beyondddddd oily. I couldn't even eat it. Spicy beef noodles wasn't spicy in the slightest either. I'm just really really disappointed considering I've been following the dumpling lady on Instagram for a while and waited way to long to try it, which upsets me because I was expecting everything to be amazing. It wasn't, it was a waste o $57.00.   That's all chili oil in the photo not broth",

I've been hearing for awhile now, how great the Dumpling Lady's food is, and I was excited to finally give it a try.   - 15+ minute wait to place our order.  - My mother in law can't handle spicy food, so we asked if it was possible to get one of the noodle dishes less spicy, and the guy working the register got an attitude with my wife for even asking, to the point that she had to walk away to avoid losing it in front of the kids - $27 for two small dumpling selections and two drinks - Half of my steamed dumplings were cold like they'd just been pulled out of the refrigerator - All the dumplings touching the bottom of the dishes were stuck to it, making it impossible to eat without tearing them apart.   The flavor was decent, but the experience definitely did not live up to the hype this place gets. Not even close to the best dumplings I've had in Charlotte, and the long wait and rude service just amplified the disappointment.",

    "text": "Friends,  We are in the midst of a new era of Dumplings. How could Charlotte's BEST food truck (by Charlotte Magazine and many others) get any better? How about open in the hottest new venue in Charlotte and offer so much more in their new stall! I'm a long time customer of the truck and was thrilled to be able to try two new items today.  I arrived at Optimist Hall around 1:30 today and the parking lot was packed. The food hall is still considered being under its \"soft opening\" stage so bear with the construction and many of the stalls not open yet. It is nice to have what I would consider my favorites already up and open. In my opinion, The Dumpling Lady's stall stands out over the rest with warm red and gold accents around the exterior and modern wood paneling along the corners and counter. I love their stall's sign above the register that's simple yet bold. Being day two of operations, everything was of course squeaky clean.  So the two new items I tried today was the Chengdu Style Pork & Scallion Boiled Dumpling, and the Garlic Pork Belly Side. The Pork and scallion was one of the best dumplings I've ever had. The pork filling was so savory, tender, and moist, and the dumpling had an amazing supple texture that was perfect. I love how boiled dumplings 'soak up' the sauce and the sauce complimented the dumpling very well. Slightly spicy, sweet, salty, the garlic based chili oil is something I wish they'd bottle and sell, but to be honest it would take away some of the magic of visiting this place if I could have it at home!  Garlic Pork Belly was delicious and tender. Instead of crisping the pork, they serve it layered with thinly sliced cucumber for the slight crunch and top it with the garlic sauce that I love. At $6 it's a bit pricey but the flavor profile is worth it.  They're going to kill it here, everything I love about one of my favorite trucks in a brick-and-mortar. Quality ingredients, amazing flavors, and more to come! This will be one of my most visited spots, I can already tell.  Congrats on the opening, Qian and team, I'll see you soon!",

The hype is really!  They by far have the longest line of any shop. Once you place your order the food comes out quickly though. You spend longer waiting in line than you will waiting for food.   The lunch special which consists of a noodle dish and 4 dumplings for $13 seemed like the best option to sample a bit of everything. We ordered Dan Dan noodles, Chili Chicken noodles, pork & chive dumplings, and pork belly dumplings. Of the noodles we preferred the chicken noodles, it was packed with flavor and had a nice spice level. We could not decide between the dumplings, they were both delicious.   We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and look forward to visiting again!",

    "text": "I'll admit it; I am a complete sucker for food trucks and anything that gets labeled as \"street food.\"  Whether domestically or abroad, I'm automatically enticed by that wafting aroma coming from a curbside cart or a lingering truck.  Whether Halal, dumplings, hot dogs, no matter what's being served, I'll probably eat it if it comes from a street food cart or truck.  With that said, I'd wanted to try The Dumpling Lady for some time, but never really had the opportunity as it's always somewhere different and I can be exceptionally lazy.  However, on one especially motivated Saturday afternoon, we made the trip to Noda Company Store to finally check it out.  Upon walking up to the counter, my first impression was how overwhelmingly nice the woman working at the truck was.  Seriously, she was great and really helpful to the customers in front of us who didn't know really what they wanted.  We had a pretty good idea from looking at the menu online, and went for the following:  LUNCH Combo: Spicy Beef Noodles w/Sweet Pork Belly Dumplings -Order of Pork & Chives Dumplings  It's worth noting that The Dumpling Lady offers soft drinks at the truck, but as it was parked at Noda Company Store, we had to go for a draft Hop Drop & Roll (they also have free ice water in pitchers, which is nice when it's 90+ degrees outside.  The sweet pork belly dumplings are absolutely delicious, and we should've done 10 of these and 6 of the Pork & Chives.  Very sweet, savory in the chili-sauce and absolutely delicious.  The pork & chives are similarly delicious, but lacking that sweetness and extra flavor profile that puts the sweet pork belly over the top.  The Spicy Beef noodles are very good in the spicy-chili sauce, and pair well with the dumplings, but are nonetheless secondary to how good the dumplings are (which is probably how it should be, given the name).  Overall, we had a very good lunch and really enjoyed our time here.  Definitely on my Charlotte recommended list and somewhere to check out when you can track them down (they post the schedule on Instagram!)",

    "text": "This place has amazing dumplings, handcrafted by the dumpling artist in the back. The savory dumplings are complemented by their wide range of delicious noodles as well. My go-to is either veggie dumplings or the pork and chive dumplings with the burning noodles to bring the heat.   If you have been used to their food truck, you will get the same smiling service and delicious food they have been serving for years. The charm of optimist hall helps to give you a good ole sit-down vibe which is a great addition to the delicious food as well.  Pros  - Great parking  - Staff is friendly - The charm of the food truck is kept in this new location - New menu items not on the food truck have been added, like the Soup Dumplings.    Cons A long line, so get ready to stand  Pro-Tip Go during lunch for their infamous lunch special, you will get a half order of dumplings as well as noodles. This is a great combo and you'll get the bang for your buck",

This is another classic example of taking a common food you can get anywhere and really paying attention to each detail so that you're left with the best expression of what the food can be. The dumplings are stupid good. The dough is perfect, the pork was perfect, the sauce was perfect. Honestly the only thing that wasn't perfect was how much food you get for the price. We had the Sweet Pork Belly Dumplings, and you get 8 for $10. We ended up going home to make a second dinner since we were still hungry, but if you treat these like an \"every once in a while\" luxury, the dumplings are so good you can justify it. This new location is nestled into the newly renovated Optimist Hall, so the atmosphere is amazing as well. I don't have to track down the truck to get my dumpling fix? I'm down.",

    "text": "For lunch, I stopped by this popular food truck at South Park area to try on their super-delish Dumplings and Noodles.  Thank God I got there super-early 'cuz within minutes, the long line quickly began forming...to the point that it made the other food trucks look sad.  Anyway, I was one of the first in line; and I ordered the much-anticipated Sweet Pork Belly Dumplings and the Spicy Beef Noodles Combo (Lunch Special)...and as expected, DOUBLE YUM!! Both were good, but the Sweet Pork Belly is BEYOND Good...maybe even BEYOND Great. It's in the league of OMG's!! One thing that CAN be improved is the slicing of the Cucumbers in the Spicy Beef Noodles...cut way too big, making them hard to eat with the noodles. I debated cutting a star for it, but given how delicious it was, I'll let it pass.  I also wish there were more tables...and maybe some chairs? This is probably not the Lady's fault. Guess I'm expecting too much from a food truck venue.  Really, I can't ask for more from a food truck. Judging by the lunch-hour fandom (at a business building parking lot!), this has got to be one of the best food trucks around. I definitely plan on hunting down this Sweet 'n Spicy Lady again...hopefully real soon!",

I have her schedule memorized and usually go at least once per week or else I go through withdrawals.   My favorite are the pork belly dumplings. I used to get the pork and chive, but have switched up my routine. I love all of the noodles, except chicken...because I hate chicken. The dumplings melt in your mouth. The ingredients are so fresh and delicious. The consistency is so loved, you know exactly what you're gonna get. And the spice! the spices are to die for. I can't wait for the store to open. I just know it's going to be the best place in Charlotte.   Thanks Dumpling Lady for all of your hard work. I definitely appreciate you!",

Fresh ingredients, the dumpling dough is perfectly cooked, the spice level is exactly where it should be without overtaking the entire meal - that being said, you can add their ultra hot sauce if you need an additional kick.  I really appreciate the lunch time combo where you can get a noodle dish and 6 dumplings for just a couple dollars more than a 1 item entree. I like the opportunity to try more than one thing.   Highly recommend the chicken and shrimp dumplings, they are my favorite - vegetable dumplings are a close second!",

Our dumplings were cold there. I assumed since she had a shop and a full kitchen now they would come out hot. Not the case. Underwhelming and overrated. The soup dumplings are OK but not served with the right sauce and more of a gyoza sauce which does not compliment them at all. This place is HYPED to the max.",

An order of four was not enough I would definitely recommend getting a full order of these.

The best part is the sweet ladies who run the truck gave me an extra portion of vegetarian noodles because my husband and I were sharing a combo but we couldn't compromised between what meat item to get being that I'm a vegetarian!

    "text": "Eight weeks on the road without some real Chinese food makes Kai kind of desperate. Desperate Kai eats gas station dumplings in South Carolina and gas station dumplings are not a good thing.   So I get back to CLT and I'm craving ramen and wait... What. Is. This?? Sichuan beef noodles? I'm out the door and headed for NoDa. Unfortunately, that's not where the Dumpling Lady is and she's nowhere to be found. So, despondent and in dismay, I head towards some izakaya place for some (hopefully) decent ramen. And somehow, by some stroke of luck, I drive by Birdsong Tap House and there in the parking lot is a red trailer... Where the Dumpling Lady lives.   The Dumpling Lady hails from Szechwan, home of the giant panda and some of the burningest, most ass firing, toilet humbling food on earth. The Dumpling Lady and her husband don't dumb their food down and definitely do not water it down. A variety of noodle and dumpling dishes grace the menu, stuff the likes of Charlotte has never seen. I got an order of beef noodles swimming in chili oil, with marinated bamboo and tender chunks of beef, as well as an order of pork and leek dumplings doused with a spicy soy and scallions. Both were phenomenal, better than most I've had even back in Los Angeles. Spicy, yes, but that's what Birdsong is for. Get yourself an IPA and douse that burning sissy boy.   In all seriousness, this is a great sign for things to Come in CLT. Talking to the Dumpling Lady and Mr. Dumpling Lady, they've got great plans for Charlotte, and judging by the responses of the other patrons, they'll be hotly welcomed by the locals. Apparently, the NoDa address is their home base, but the trailer travels. This was their first night at Birdsong, but expect to find them at Atherton as well as NoDa.   Best of luck to you Mr and Mrs Dumpling Lady!  Oh. One tip. If you're allergic to cabbage, don't eat the kimchee.",

They didnt have any that day but they said that they had regular spicy sauce but i was only given regular dumpling sauce.   The order taker was a bit rushed and not very helpful.   Pork and Chive Dumpling: The wrapper had a gummy texture and doughy taste. The sauce was typically good but with out any spice. The filling seems okay but was overpowered by the taste of the wrapper.  Sweet Pork Belly Dumpling: The won ton wrapper used was much better. The filling had much more flavor and meatiness to it. The sauce was very powerful, strong garlic flavor (love garlic) but was pretty salty (could use a little sugar or chili oil to balance).   Steam Bao: The dough was dense and firm when not light and tender the bun ionly detracted from the sandwich. The Pork Belly was very flavorful but was cooked until firm and dry. Pork belly is at it's best with fully cooked yet tender, juicy and succulent. It should literally fall apart and melt in the mouth.",

I finally caught them at a brewery and was only too excited to have authentic Chinese dumplings again. I had dumplings on a trip to Shanghai almost 10 years ago and I've been dreaming about them ever since! I tried the spicy beef noodle and the pork and chive dumplings and both were superb. The noodles were VERY SPICY but VERY DELICIOUS. The dumplings were perfectly steamed and the sauce topped them off! Will be going back for more soon.",

Craft coffee, Craft beer, hand Crafted dumplings for the trifecta!  I tell myself every time I go that this will be the time that I try the Noodles, but those dumplings are so darn good that I make a knee-jerk decision and switch at the last minute every single time. My favorite dumpling combinations is Sweet Pork Belly and Chicken & Shrimp. They cover the dumplings in a sauce made from ingredients from \"the mountains of Sichuan/fields of NC\". No idea what that means, I do know it's amazeballs (I've been witness to my husband drinking it straight from the tin...a few beers may or may not have been a contributing factor lol).",

    "text": "Definitely worth standing in line at 11am in the blistering Charlotte heat! The Dumpling Lady is a food truck that will sit in front of One Wells Fargo on Friday at 11-2 (right outside the entrance, you can't possibly miss it), but definitely get there early -- I arrived at 10:45 and there was already a line of people waiting! However, once they open they move fast! It helps that they have plenty of menus that are passed down the line, so by the time you're at the window, you're not going \"ummmmmm I don't know what I want\".  The $12 lunch special is filling and a good bang for your buck -- you get 1 noodle and 6 dumplings. (You normally get 9 dumplings in a dumpling order, but I don't think I could eat 9 dumplings and the noodles in one go.) I chose the Dan Dan noodles -- a Sichuan specialty -- and some sweet pork belly dumplings. The Dan Dan noodles were perfectly spicy -- definitely mix the noodles, beef, and sauce before you partake or you won't get the full experience! The sweet pork belly dumplings were surprising as I expected a traditional potsticker style dumpling instead of the shumai style dumplings that you would get at a dim sum restaurant, but the wrappers were done well (not thick and not soggy) and the filling had a light five-spice taste to them, which complemented the sauce. And definitely get the sauce on top -- it's spicy and complements the food well.  The one thing that I would warn about is that unlike some food trucks, this one doesn't sell beverages (or at least, I didn't see any offered on the menu). But I'll definitely be back the next time the truck rolls around in Uptown to get my dumpling and noodle fix!",

    "text": "I give this a high 2, almost a 3 due to customer service.   Disclaimer: I am a self-appointed dumpling snob. I'm from Taiwan.   Moving onto the review..   My boyfriend told me about this food truck that comes to NoDa on Saturday afternoons so I was extremely excited - especially with the limited amount of authentic Asian food in Charlotte. Finally, the day arrived and I couldn't wait. I should also add that my boyfriend and I have been living a more vegetarian lifestyle but Asian food is usually pretty solid to that particular diet.. Lots of creative ways to eat veggies.   Unfortunately, out of their many options on their menu... Only 2 were Vegetarian friendly. One noodle dish and one dumpling option. That alone was very disappointing. There could easily be more mushroom based dumplings, for example.   Ordered a potatoe-veggie dumpling and I quickly realized that these are pre-made (understandably so), pre-frozen and tasted ...amateur. Skin of the dumpling was rough, wasn't reheated all the way through, very chewy and definitely NOT \"fresh\" tasting. The inside of the dumpling looked like mush. Very bland. The only saving grace was the sauce that the dumplings that are doused in. Now that - was probably the only good thing about my experience. (Mind you, we had 3 separate containers of these dumplings) I would not pay $9 again for cold, basic dumplings. Sorry :(  The noodles were ordered hot and arrived very cold. She said they were the last ones and could not be re-heated. I wish I had known that initially when we picked up the food but I digress. She was very nice though and gave us free dumplings. The noodles are something I would order again but only if they were piping hot.   ProTip:   follow her on Instagram: @thedumplinglady for weekly updates on her locations and times  if you are intent on trying her, I could recommend visiting her at the beginning of her shift instead of the later. Dumpling options start to dwindle and you might have better luck than I with fresher ones.",

We haven't had any of the scheduling issues that some other Yelpers have, we follow her on Instagram and it hasn't lead us wrong. The sauce is no joke, it's not an exaggeration, it's incredibly good. It is spicy, but not outrageous, definitely worth the heat (even my no spicy nothing Dad liked it!). Put another one down for saving the sauce and putting it on everything else at home. My fiance and I have tried to recreate it, and have been totally unsuccessful. I love everything about the dumplings. I think the sweet pork belly are my favorite. Followed VERY closely by the shrimp and chicken. The noodles I wasn't crazy impressed with, but I stick to the dumplings. The food is as locally sourced as possible, with spices shipped in from her hometown. We always buy three orders of dumplings for the two of us, one each and then one to share. I could just eat one, but then I'd want to order another.   I would agree that the service is not really warm fuzzy, but the food is so good that it doesn't bother me. We'd follow this truck all over town. Go by the Instagram schedule and you shouldn't have any issue.",

I did the lunch combo where you get noodles and a small portion of dumplings for $12.99- a little steep for lunch but it was SO much food so it was worth it in my opinion.   The dumplings are light, flavorful and have a great texture to them. I did the pork and chive and they were the best dumplings I've had in a long time.  The noodle dish was good, but way overshadowed by the dumplings (they were a tough act to follow). I had the Zha Jiang Noodles which were the less spicy option with ground sausage. The noodles had a nice, mild flavor and were very filling. The only changes I'd make to this dish would be more meat options like chicken and pork belly and more vegetables to balance it out.   Overall I really liked this food truck and will definitely return. The dumplings are the star of the show by far and id honestly recommend just getting a big serving of the dumplings for lunch! Next time I want to try the rice bowls and the bao buns.",

Noodles are $9 a bowl and dumplings are $10 for 11 dumplings. This is pretty steep but I guess their the only business of their kind in the area and they are a food truck so the higher price is expected. I got the pork and chives dumplings and the zhajiang mian, or black bean sauce noodles.   The dumplings were good and the sauce it came with was great, I added a lot of black vinegar though lol, but it didn't seem to have a big difference from the store bought dumpling I get. The noodles were similar, I think they are egg noodles, and had some strips of cucumber and other veggies. This was definitely not black bean noodles lol the sauce was completely different. I don't know if they just got the sauce wrong or if they're passing off these as black bean noodles.   We got a to go order and they were kind enough to pack the food and sauces separately for us which was great. I would say by and far the sauces are the highlight of their dishes. It is traditional chinese hot chili oil with some garlic, ginger, and spring onions. This is definitely home made and fresh and tastes amazing!   I'm not as sure about the actual food part, they are very similar to what I can get from stores but they were still very good in flavor. The prices are steep but I believe they have cheaper offerings during lunch. Definitely worth a try for some very authentic, for the area, chinese food.",

    "text": "Dumplings has good flavors. I do not find much difference between pork and chive from pork belly. The sauce is good with lots of ginger taste. I Did not try the noodles, my friend rate it okay. Honestly not worth trying to hunt it down. There is a dumping stand in the G mart grocery store on independence. Their dumplings are bigger in size, but sauce is not as good as dumpling lady.  I gave it a 3 d/t difficulty to find and they were not at noda at 430. I end up eat somewhere else. Saw they were open  1.5 hours later, so decided to get some to go. In Noda they are located behind Noda Company Store. Easier to see Smelly Cat coffee store, it right behind it. There are sitting area, which is nice.   There is a parking lot next to it. 5 dollars but no attendance, likely cash .  It's also pricey , 9 dollar for 8-10 small dumplings.",

    "text": "Holy Dumpling Batman!  A few friends tried some options from the Dumpling Lady while it was parked behind the Company Store in NoDa. For being one of the smallest food trucks in Charlotte, the flavors are big and bold!  I started out with the pork belly dumplings and they were delicious with wonderful flavors. I couldn't get enough of the coriander. But the problem was I wanted more! 10 dumplings just weren't enough so I went back for more. This time tried the chicken and crab dumplings as well as the beef noodles. I have to say both options were delicious but the beef noodles were my favorite. The spice level was spot on and exactly what I was looking for.  The staff is great here and they give you a pager so you don't have to hang around the food truck waiting for someone to call your name.   But one suggestion. I think the truck should be renamed to \"The Fabulous Dumpling Lady\".",

We had the Dan Dan noodles as shown in the photo and we got two orders of dumplings one spicy pork belly and the other chicken and mushroom, both fantastic! Also great customer service! We had called them to find out where they were located tonight and they returned the call shortly after, we'll definitely be back! Thanks Dumpling Family",
