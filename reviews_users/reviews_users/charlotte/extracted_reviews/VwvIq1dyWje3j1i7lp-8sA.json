My husband ordered a steak, my daughter got a regular cheeseburger, and I had a French dip sandwich. While my sandwich was fine, there was nothing special about it. My daughter didn't like the cheeseburger at all, and the steak looked... average... with no comment about it from my husband. My daughter thought we should have just gone to SmashBurger and I agreed that the French Dips at Arby's were better than what I had. So... a big disappointment and a bill for over $75 that could have been well-spent elsewhere. Save your money and time!",

I like how the bar is illuminated with colorful bottles lining the wall and that the whole bar area is separate from the restaurant.  The ladies who greeted us were so warm & friendly.  The restaurant is really up to date and has a trendy look to it with some of the seat backs lined with colorful pillows.  The walls are lined with wine bottles and you can see the chefs preparing the food behind a glass wall in the kitchen.  Service is top notch and food was delicious.  Coffee is excellent here!!!  Can't wait to take my Husband!!",

    "text": "Takeout is always a difficult review to give but I think it stays True to the core of the food and how it was prepared. We ordered the filet, saluted spinach, the ahi tuna app and the prime rib. The filet was cooked well and was tender and juicy. The prime rib was also cooked well though not enough to Caramelize the fat. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the wasabi sauce had a nice hint of spice.  The sides however were not prepared well. We had both the sauteed spinach and the green beans.  The spinach was horrible. Saturated in butter and garlic and dripping with juice. The portion size was also so small that I thought it was an oversight.  Lastly the price was high for the quality of the meal. The steak quality was average, the appetizer was average, and the sides were below average.  In my opinion, if you need takeout, save your money and go somewhere else for the same quality meal.",

There's nothing special here: it's a slightly upscale chain restaurant in an artificial \"urban\" shopping center.  That said, the food was pretty tasty on a tired Tuesday night.  I ordered the parmesan-crusted flounder with mashed potatoes and spicy pecan green beans.  Those beans were seriously good.  The rest of the dish played second fiddle but was still quite appetizing.  My wife had the wood-fired salmon with a loaded baked potato and it also received thumbs up.  The service was friendly but pretty slow; it took 10 minutes just to get him to return the check.  I guess other reviewers have noticed this as well.  I liked the place.  If I'm shopping in the area, I'll definitely consider it.  However, don't count on me driving over to Southpark just to go to Firebirds.",

    "text": "Oh, how I want to love Firebirds. It's within 10 minutes of our house and so close to Southpark mall, Earthfare and the Barnes and Nobles. But sadly, it has consistently fallen short when we don't just stop in for drinks.   The positives - location, decor, and drinks. I've already spoken about it's convenient location. The inside decor is very nice and laid back, and I love the bar area with the fireplace that you can sit next to while enjoying a cocktail when it's chilly outside. The drink menu is also very good. You absolutely have to try the Black Diamond drink. If you've ever had a Stoli Doli from Capital Grille, it's the same thing but with Sky Vodka instead of Stoli. Basically, a juice box for adults. Love it...but be careful; they'll sneak up on you if you have more than one.   The negatives - dining room service and food. The service at the bar is just fine, but when you get into the dining room, the service level drops off significantly. The food is also well below par for the price range. We started with the chicken quesadilla, which was okay, and I ordered the fish of the day as my main course. It Mahi Mahi and was to come with sauteed spinach and tomato and parmesan mashed potatoes. They brought my dinner out and it was literally swimming in tomato sauce (which effectively destroyed the mashed potatoes). The fish was prepared well, and the spinach and tomato pieces were also very good...I'm just not sure why they would drown it in tomato juice.   In the end, this is a great restaurant for drinks and possibly appetizers, but I would recommend heading to another restaurant in the area if you're looking for a full meal with good service.",

Things I liked:  Free valet service, call-ahead seating, crayons and a colorful kids menu that had non-fried options, and a unique high-chair that looked less uncomfortable than most.  Also, the Cucumber Gimlet Martini was refreshing (if you are a gin drinker) and the soups (tomato and chicken tortilla) were both yummy.  Our server, Kendra, was nice and did her job well.  Things of which I was not a fan:  My chief complaint was the SALT!  This was the saltiest food I have had in a while.  It was so salty that my dad cancelled a side order of spinach after tasting someone else's.  Every leaf was covered in salt.  My son's chicken and my husband's sandwich were both very salty and my mom said that she thought the kitchen staff may have accidentally double-salted her burger.  I tasted it and it was . . . salty!  I asked for double rub on my \"Delmonico\" so I was not as disappointed by its saltiness - though what I was looking for was more spice, which cannot be added separately from the other ingredients in the rub.  Also the wines by the glass are pricey.   A friend who joined us ordered the sesame-coated salmon and it was NOT too salty.  I had a taste and it was yummy.",

Entrees included the blackened tuna tacos, grilled shrimp tacos, some salad with fried chicken on top and the seared tuna. No complaints by anyone. I had the shrimp tacos and I'd definitely get them again.  Service: fine. We didn't really test them, but everyone was polite and attentive.

We were greeted by a waiter, who asked for our drink order, I asked for water to look over the wine list, when another server arrived and asked for our drink order.. Should have known there that this night wasn't going to be so great.  After placing our drink order our waitress returned every 2 seconds to see if we were ready to order, which by the third time in less than 10 minutes I felt compelled to place our order, yet still somewhat undecided. We ordered the 14 oz Prime Rib and the Surf and Turf entree. The Prime Rib was excellent, cooked perfectly and served with a light au jus and horseradish on the sade. However, the filet was very rare for my taste, after requesting medium, so I did send it back. Returned a perfect medium, which I enjoyed than very much.  As for the lobster, grilled to perfection, although no butter dipping sauce, bummer! The food was good, but would have expected better for the prices and some of the other reviews.  Unfortunately the service was the most disappointing part of the evening. After being stalked for our order at the beginning of the night that is all we really saw of our waitress, Adelene.  We never saw her again until one of the other waiters told her we were looking for our check, ridiculous! I had to flag another waiter down to have my steak corrected, and another waiter to order a second drink.  I wish she focused more on customer service rather than whatever it was she was focused on..I think it would have been a much better experience.",

Grilled chicken salad with brussel sprouts was excellent. We loved the fresh squeezed lemonade with vodka. I would return to this restaurant.",

The bar area also has a cushy bench by a fireplace for people to wait for their tables & it's away from the entry door, so that is a nice feature.  They brought out this bread that has a very distinctive shape to it which we thought was funny, but we cut into it, DELISH! & asked for another.  Sweetie had the small filet & I had the sirloin.  I like \"blue\" steak, so my rare came out perfectly.  Sweetie asked for medium, but his was as rare as mine.  His filet was seasoned better than my sirloin.  The spicy pecan green beans weren't spicy at all, which suits me & they were not too crisp with plenty of small chunks of the pecan.  The server was very nice, but she easily overlooked us even when we were getting the attention of the people she was currently helping, but not her attention.  That happened a couple of times and she disappeared for a good 20-30 minutes towards the end of our meal and we had to ask another server to find her for us.   If she had been more available we probably would have ordered another drink and dessert & coffee, but we just didn't feel like hanging out anymore after that.  We would probably go again.",

He was imformatibe, engaging and funny,  attentive and was just on point. I don't like cake so all the servers signed and gave me a card which I thought was a really nice touch. The food was excellent as well. We will definitely be back! Of course I would love to have Joshua as a server again. The whole experience, from the food to the service was excellent!",

This particular night, I had the ribeye & my companion, the ahi tuna. Neither one of us was disappointed. I actually found the ribeye to be just as good, if not better, than the higher end restaurants. It was of really good quality, seasoned to perfection, & NOT pressed (the latter is very important). There have been times when I miscommunicated how I wanted something prepared & they were always patient & eager to satisfy.

We usually go to the the Rea Rd location (highly recommend) but they didn't have a table for our timeframe tonight.   First off we were seated and we sat and sat and sat before our server finally came to take our drink order.  She asked if we were ready to order food (to which we said yes) and she said be right back. Fast forward 10 more minutes and my husband gets his beer and we finally order.  My filet kabob (which I ordered Medium came out well done). It was tough and dry.  She was impossible to flag down so I just suffered through.  The \"veggies\" were mostly tomatoes and raw red onion.  My side of broccoli was good.  I am giving them 2 stars because my husbands steak was marvelous (but his green beans were completely unseasoned).  It was a very disappointing experience, which is sad considering it was a very rare date night.  We will be sticking with our regular Firebirds from now on.  *we returned here tonight to try again.  Food was fantastic and our service was almost good. That is until she had another table sat.  It took us longer to pay than it did to eat.  Finally someone else took pity on us and rang us out.  It should never be that difficult to pay.  Feel like they just dropped the ball.  So frustrating.",

It was hard to find a close-by upscale restaurant that was going to be open, and Firebirds was my third choice. When the restaurant opened, it was a favorite of ours, and the food is still very good. But just like the last couple of times we were there, the service was slow and very inattentive. The place was nowhere near full, as it used to be every weekend meal, perhaps because people really don't eat out on Super Bowl Sunday--I'm not sure about that. It seemed they were short-handed. We ordered an appetizer (onion rings) which was delicious and generous, but we had finished it long before the server took our dinner order. We waited almost an hour for our entrees. Again, the food was very good, and still a good value, but we kept wondering where our server was. We had to ask for bread for the table, and flag her down for drink refills. She never updated us about our food, like saying the kitchen was backed up, or they were short staffed. I guess we will go back, but only when we have plenty of time to sit at the table and wait.",

We usually venture out to the location in StoneCrest, however, SouthPark is now closer and we will definitely be back!  The bread that comes out to the table is a serious crack addiction. I can't get enough!!!  I started my dinner off with their signature martini, The Double Black Diamond (fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with Svedka All Natural Citron Vodka and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice). If I could have, and I quite possibly might do this one night, I could have sat at the bar and ordered these all night along with the bread and been perfectly content. Such a delicious cocktail, well balanced, and smooth.   For dinner, I opted for the parmesan encrusted Mahi with tomato basil buerre blanc and the sauteed mushrooms. The fish was cooked perfectly, the seasoning complimented the fish, and the mushrooms were so tasty. My husband had the rib-eye steak, mid-rare, with steak fries, and according to him, the steak was cooked to the perfect mid-rare, and was seasoned well.   Our waitress was so sweet, and attentive (gosh I wish I could remember her name). The restaurant itself had a nice crowd, not too busy, and was clean and well-staffed for the amount of tables seated.   We will be back for their wine nights to try that out, and the SouthPark location is now our new fav. 5 stars, job VERY well done! Thank you for starting out our date night right!",

    "text": "First time here, & I was definitely satisfied. First off, the service was fantastic. Not only was our waiter knowledgeable and extra friendly, but so were all of the other staff. I ordered the filet mignon with loaded baked potato, & my boyfriend ordered the coconut shrimp with steak fries. Everything was going great, but then we realized we had been waiting quite some time for our meal to arrive--about 30-40 minutes after ordering. We didn't say anything about it, just kept chit-chatting to fill the time. Our food finally got there, delivered by the manager. He apologized to us for the wait, let us know that our entrees would be free, and asked if everything looked okay. Then our waiter came by right after and said that you should never have to wait that long when you come to firebirds. We were very thankful for this, and went on to enjoy our meals thoroughly. Everything tasted great! It was so nice to have our meals taken care of, especially since we didn't even have to point out that the wait was too long. We will definitely be returning to this chain whenever possible!",

The smell was extremely pungent upon arrival of our food.  We informed the manager and she comped the meals and attempted to make it right but if you have a head chef that can't distinguish good or bad food, then why would I want to eat anything else. We also paid for two additional meals, which we shouldn't have because my daughter was scared to eat out of fear of getting sick.",

I've dined at three locations in North Carolina (Raleigh, Ballantyne, South Park Charlotte).  I LOVE the South Park location, they offer a private room for small events. Check with management for details.   The dim lighting, design, and decor make for an enjoyable atmosphere to be in. Menu prices reasonable, I would highly recommend trying their happy hour menu. Also, don't miss trying their signature martini, The Double Black Diamond! So Delish!!  Here's a list of all my favorite meals: - Lobster Spinach Queso - Smoked Chicken Wings - Crab Cakes - Fired Up Shrimp - Grilled Shrimp & Strawbery Salad - Pepper Encrusted Sirloin* AMAZING!!! - Parmesan Encrusted Mahi - Firebirds Chicken Pasta  Overall this is by far my favorite American restaurant. This establishment has met/exceeded my expectations.",

Both times, I have left thinking that I could have gotten better food elsewhere, especially for the cost. Tonight I ordered a kids meal for my niece, which was cold when it came out and the mac and cheese, in her words, \"did not taste like anything.\" She was content with her burger, though. I got the Parmesan Mahi which came out hot and delicious. I was very happy with my meal. For a tuesday, they were pretty busy. Our waitress seemed to have a lot going on. We were checked on a couple times and she did a decent job considering how busy she was.   Overall, okay experience but will probably not visit again.",

I'd had a crappy day at work so liquor was required so I started with the Pomegranate martini which was super tasty! But my dinner was just a bit underwhelming. I ordered the Blue Cheese Filet and loaded baked potato. I ordered it medium well and it came out a little more well done than I liked, good thing it had the blue cheese sauce and mushrooms! The worse part was the dessert. I was especially disappointed with the chocolate cake it was just totally blah. I wouldn't recommend it and definitely will not be ordering it again.   Oh Firebirds! I don't want to break up with you! I want to be a huge fan, but visits like this make it hard for me to keep loving you!",

    "text": "So, hubby and I ordered Firebirds for takeout. I picked it up and headed home. One of the entrees had bacon in it, even though we had requested NO bacon multiple of times. The manager who spoke to us was very kind and made a new dish, promised he'd refund the money because it was their fault (and it was, the order receipt also stated NO bacon). We never got the refund. Two weeks later, as we are in the area, we ventured in. The manager made us wait 45 MINUTES as he was \"trying to locate the order\" in their system. I had paid with a credit card and had proof. 45 minutes later, he tells us he cannot locate the receipt but will continue looking into it. At this point, I would expect the full amount to be refunded (nearly $70). Few days later I get a brief phone call from a different manager who tells me he has located the receipt on their end and will refund the entree. $19.76 refunded, really?! It took nearly 4+ weeks to get this ordeal cleaned up. We would have never wanted a refund if it was not first initiated from the manager. Why even say something that you cannot fulfill? In other words, we will never be back.",

The chicken was great and the mixed greens were fresh. The bar is nicely stocked with a wide variety of liquor at various price points, and it looks cool too. Price for food is reasonable and they email you with discounts from time to time. They even have live music on the patio sometimes. It's pretty cool.

    "text": "I am disappoint.    When the original Firebirds opened in Stonecrest, many moons ago, it was my favorite restaurant in Charlotte to go to.  Tender, juicy beef and well prepared sides.  The SouthPark location is either an anomaly in an otherwise fine restaurant group, or Firebirds has fallen into chain complacency and just isn't trying anymore.  On a rainy Tuesday, a little ahead of the dinner rush (if there even was a rush, there were plenty of tables available when we left at 8:00), I was eagerly anticipating a juicy piece of prime rib with a loaded baked potato that I had been dreaming of since we named the date for our monthly dinner outing.  Imagine my sadness when I was told by a manager that the whoozle-what in the oven kerplopped and the prime rib was a dried out mess (he explained what happened, but after I got the gist that I wasn't getting the dinner I wanted, I tuned him out).  He said he would return after getting my re-order, but never did.  The food: Complimentary bread with butter:  Delightful.  Crunchy exterior, soft interior, delicious with a chunk of butter. 14 oz ribeye ($26) - (instead of the prime rib that I wanted) - Firebirds and Outback must share a meat delivery - mediocre piece of meat that was on the other side of the medium that I ordered, and dry.  The portion that would have been up against the bone was the tastiest portion, the rest was just meh and a little chewy.  The loaded baked potato that was served with it was barely warm enough to melt the butter.  And the entree came moments after I did the re-order, along with my date's medium-well filet - are you pre-cooking the meat?  How did it get done so quickly? Big Daddy Chocolate Cake ($7.25) - more like Shrimpy Weirdo Cousin Stu's cake.  Aside from the raspberry sauce it was served with, you could get the exact same cake right now at any grocery store bakery section.  Moist to the point of squishy, not good.  When 2 gals (at least one of which has the PMS) who love to eat don't finish a piece of chocolate cake, there is something wrong.  Service was fine, he kept up with my refills for the most part.  Parking is a joke - condo only, 30 minute, 15 minute, only a certain tenant, only between 9 and 5 or some such crap - I shouldn't have to stop and read the writing in a space, I should just be able to park.  Valet parking is also available though, which I noticed when I was walking in.  Total for dinner (1 ribeye, 1 filet, 1 cocktail, 1 soft drink, 1 piece of chocolate cake) was $82 before tip and it was absolutely not worth it.  I have no problem paying for what a meal is worth and this did not hit the mark.  Not at all.  I won't be returning to this location, and with all the restaurants in my fine city now, I may have to break up with Firebirds completely if this is the quality that is now the standard.",

My parents would never have spent that kind of money on my 6yr old palette and attitude.  But hey, maybe times have changed.    Anyways, I was in town for work and staying close by so this was one of the many options around the SouthPark area.  And if you are in the mood for some steak, you should definitely stop in.   I started a salad so loaded down with bacon that it might have well been named \"plate of bacon bits with lettuce\".  Which I'm not complaining - it was darn good.  I love bacon.  And when my steak arrived, I loved that too.  Tender and juicy but a little cool.  And yes, I ordered it rare but only the center should be cool.  Not the outside. I'm not going to dock points for that since during this particular trip to the Charlotte/Fort Mill area, I was served plenty of cool food.  Maybe it is regional thing?  The woodfire they have going in plain view of the restaurant is awesome -and smells soooooo good.  I would definitely be back here on another trip to the area!",

The sweet tater fries were crisp and hot. Service was good. Food was great! One negative to note,  it is very loud in this restaurant, no soft surfaces to absorb noise.",

    "text": "My wife and I used to frequent the Firebirds in Ballantyne quite a bit.  Loved the \"aspen\"-like atmosphere and wood fired cuisine - so we were stoked when they opened the second location in South Park, about 2 miles from our house a couple years ago.    At first it was great, just as good as Ballantyne, but my guess is that  a different manager took over, because it simply is just not as good as the Ballantyne location any longer.  Everything has suffered, the food quality is less, service is meh, and you just get the impression whoever is running the place is trying to turn it into an Applebees - seriously... an Applebees.    Seriously?  Buffalo bites on the menu?  Balloons tied to the tables for Valentine's day?  c'mon, this place is supposed to fall somewhere in between Outback and Ruth's Chris, and instead of moving their offering towards the prime steakhouses, they're falling backwards!    I will say, the lobster queso appetizer, even though over the years has steadily decreased its lobster to queso ratio, tastes great.  They have a salmon entree that's also delicious.  Also when order a steak, you can get a \"side\" salad for like 5 bucks - which is huge, definitely big enough to share with your date.    My problem is, I want a steak when I go there, and the meat quality at the South Park location is bonk - even compared to the one in Ballantyne.  I can say that about the small and large bacon wrapped filets, the prime rib, and the ribeye - all have gotten tougher and grizzlier over time.    Honestly the best part of this place is the bar area - it's a great place for drinks after a day on the grind.  This place is being relegated into \"lunch-only\" territory for me.",

    "text": "It's a bit disappointing when a restaurant (or a person, or a job, or a movie, for that matter) doesn't live up to its potential. This Firebirds has a lot going for them: decent sized menu, great location in SouthPark, pretty outdoor patio and nice, attentive service. But even with all of these seemingly nice features, the main component - the food - falls short.   I enjoyed a lunch on the patio and while it's lovely, there isn't much of a view. Maybe I'm just too short, but all I saw were shrubs in my face. I ordered the fish tacos made with Mahi Mahi, served with roasted almond couscous. Sounded pretty damn tasty, and for $11 I went for it.   While the couscous was generous in portion and toasted almond-y flavor, the fish tacos (the entire point of the meal) left a whole lot to be desired. For one, there were two tiny cubes of fish on each taco - I ate much more slaw than fish. But the main issue? The fish was incredibly salty...so salty I was downing my water and could hardly taste the flaky Mahi Mahi underneath. Sad fish. I ate the couscous instead.   I think I'll head back to Firebirds for a cocktail at the bar...that seems to be more up my alley!",

Mainly cause I like staring at the wall of liquor bottles and imagining this place as a must hit in the case of a zombie apocalypse.   Recently, my husband and I came Friday night for a drink and appetizer. My husband got the Bourbon and Ginger Smash and I got the Glenmo Sour. Both drinks were fantastic. For an appetizer, we got the crap cakes. The slaw with the crab cakes completed the dish. Super tasty.  Service was excellent. Overall, great dining experience!",

I will say, I used to love these martinis but the last couple of times they have been extremely weak to the point of barely tasting alcoholic.   The crab cakes were good but the slaw and mango habanero chutney really took this appetizer to the next level. The flavor profiles complimented each other perfectly.   The dinners we got were the delmonico with a loaded baked potato (perfectly cooked medium rare) and the Parmesan crusted mahi with Parmesan mashed potatoes. The potatoes were average but the mahi was mind blowing. Probably the best mahi I have ever tasted and would recommend anyone wanting fish for dinner. We finished the meal with a alcoholic dessert drink called a flannel pajamas that was absolutely delicious and is not too sweet or too strong. Perfectly balanced coffee and chocolate flavored.   The food and drinks were awesome but the real reason this was a hands down five star was the service. Our server, Jimmy, was attentive and extremely helpful with menu choices. Love this place!!!",

Well since the restaurant specialty is \"Fire Grilled\" I thought what could be better than a fire grilled rib eye. I know mine's are great when I grill at home. Well what a disappointment. I ask for a medium and it was. So why was it so tough and dry? According to the menu it says aged. However, I'm pretty sure it wasn't nor did it have that marble appearance of a good cut. I've had better rib eye at less expensive chain restaurants. My husband had the tenderloin which was better. I think the restaurant as a whole isn't bad, so I will probably go again but I will never get another rib eye.",

I have been a few times, both when I ate meat and didn't, and each time I've walked away relatively satisfied with the experience, but not blown away.  This time, I went for my younger brother's birthday dinner. It had probably been a couple years since the last time I came and so I went in with an open mind. We got the onion rings and some bread for the table, both of which were enjoyed by all of us. Apparently the ranch was to die for, but I cannot personally vouch.   We then moved on to the main course, at which my family got steaks, and I got vegetarian kabobs. Although they are not on the menu, my waiter kindly informed me that they are an option to ring up, which was definitely good to know. The vegetables were good, although I didn't think the grilled format worked super well for the zucchini or squash. Still, the balsamic glaze pulled the dish together and it definitely did the job.  One of my family members did have to send their food back because it was cold, but the restaurant handled it well and we all left happy. The mixed drinks seemed good and the salad my family got was enjoyed as well.  Overall, decent food and great service. Better local places to get a meal though.",

They also seem to have a pretty high standard for the servers they hire as well. If you are ever unhappy with a dish brought to you, they will re-fire or replace it. Ever since I had a Chile rubbed Delmonico, I've been hooked.  Although I normally frequent the location at Rea Road, a couple of months ago this particular location reopened after a remodel and I had the opportunity to check them out. The large fireplace and seating area by the bar really draw you in; there's also a main dining room and patio seating. The signature cocktail, the Double black Diamond (a martini), is made with pineapple that's been soaking in vodka for a few weeks - it's high octane and delicious! (and only $5 during Happy Hour)  During the week there are \"bar bite\" specials and drink specials (and until 5 on weekends). The Jalapeno deviled eggs, Nashville Chicken Sliders and Sam Adams Beer Cheese (with pretzels) are the best ones.  Did I mention the portions? The Colorado Chicken salad (my favorite) is enough food for two people and the Ribeye Sandwich is pretty amazing.  If you sign up for emails, they will send you a coupon on your Birthday, let you know about special menu items and dinner/wine events.",

The Jalapeno Deviled Eggs were delicious. Watch out for that piece of jalapeno for it can get really hot under the collar.  Beef Slider buns at the bottom were bit burnt and kind of tough to chew.

On the other extreme hand - Criminal $6 for the smallest Slaw you've ever seen!  Think smallest container of salsa from Moe's or like take out, then divide by 2. Taking a step further, there's no cider, no vinegar, no sauce. Maybe they forgot mine, but dry as can be imagined. And... $6 for smallest side ever sold. Not worth a buck.

My wife ordered medium well and it arrived bleeding. The server was a bit aloof for my taste, but friendly enough when she was around. Overall, I felt the meal was substandard for the $35 price tag. I realize it isn't fine dining, but I've had enough similarly priced meals to set my expectations correctly. I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again.",

And I can see why those places were closed, as there was very little going on today. We were one of only three tables occupied the whole time we were eating our late lunch.  We opted to skip an appetizer and enjoyed the tasty bread while we waited for lunch to arrive. It didn't take long. My wife had the French Dip which had a nice big bowl of jus for dipping. I had a standard cheeseburger (I think the waiter misheard me as I wanted the blue cheese burger, but it worked out okay). Both came with awesome fries that were perfect.

She was the bomb. Very informative in her opinions on drinks and bar bites. I bumped into my gurl Bianka & though a bit packed we were able to fit together at the bar. We were lucky enough to get to try all of the bar bites. They are all amazing!!!! Even if you don't like certain foods the presentation alone is outstanding. Did I mention the drinks are to die for. They make pineapple vodka in house and will use it in their cocktails. It is YUMMY!   I cannot wait to get a chance to come back here. It's been a bit since the event. I wish I could have finished this review earlier, but I am making an effort to get back here so I can write a follow up review.",

    "text": "The GRAND Re-Opening event at this Firebirds location in SouthPark was A1. I along with nine other Yelp Elite were choose to attend this event that was advertised as live music, raffles, passed appetizers, etc.. from 6pm - 9pm.  I arrived at 5:58pm and after calling my husband to check his ETA I found that he was about 15mins away so I decide to head in and try to get a seat before the rush. Well Low and Behold the RUSH had already started. Upon entering there was a table where you enter yourself into the raffle for a chance to win dinner for 4 or dinner and a movie for two. You also were directed to grab a gift bag. I completed a form for myself and my husband and grabbed two bags. I walked through the bar and didn't see one familiar Yelp face so I went back to inquire if the Yelp meet up was in the bar and the host smiled and said YES. I then turned around and saw a familiar face Ms. Rah Rah. She was sipping a Dirty Girl martini and a little confused as she inquired about the email and the bartender said everything was discounted but nothing comp. I went back to my email and noticed that Becky directed me to introduce myself to A.J when onsite so Rah Rah and I found AJ. He was amazing and he is the new GM for this place. He was a really great guy and took great care of us. I had a Sex in the Queen City, my hubby had Ginger beer and collectively we ordered one of each of the seven appetizers (it was 4 of us) to taste.   The pass appetizers started coming once the order was placed and unfortunately everything consisted of MEAT (land animal) which is where my disconnect came into play. I'm a pescaterian (seafood only) but I'm not to the point that I can't eat something that has a certain meat near it like chicken or turkey. I absolutely can't eat anything touching or associated with Pork.   Our appetizer spread consisted of the following with flavor ratings  Coconut Shrimp - Super crisp and flavorful. The slaw was to die for and the sauce the shrimp was sitting atop. Yum and definitely did into that slaw  Onion rings with ranch - The onion rings were fried perfectly and the breading was seasoned to the T. They were tasty without the ranch but the range provided additional flavor   CrabCake - Lucky for this dish it was paired with that SUPER SLAW from earlier. Having lived in MD for a shortwhile and eating the BEST car cakes EVER it's hard to really enjoy a CrabCake anywhere else. This one was OK  Lobster Queso - Yum :-) Does that explain this dish. I mean the chips were freshly fried and the Queso was so warm and filled with chunks of lobster   Ahi Tuna - The tuna was paired with a great tasting salad. It was OK as far as tuna is concerned but the salad made it worth my while. I think some ginger and a drizzle of a sweet or Thai chili sauce would set this dish off as the peanut drizzle wasn't robust enough.  Smoked chicken - My husband and the others who ate the chicken said it was too salty but they appreciated the fact that it wasn't breaded and fries well.  Chicken quesadilla - My husband and the others LOVED these, they were stuffed with shredded chicken breast and veggies and very fulfilling   Overall WE WERE STUFFED & had an amazing time. We look forward to visiting again this time with our children in tow.",

I was wondering how they'd handle this all and I must say I am quite impressed enough to stop and write an actual review.   Yes, I've been more than 2x and usually Happy Hour - which is daily, in the bar and patio only.   Y'all they packaged this Medium Well peppercorn 12oz cut in slices (which next time I'll request not to do) with the blue cheese and mushrooms separated in a ramekin. Crab cakes are like someone from home made them (insert googly eyes) as the crab is THICK and CHUNKY non of that cheap shredded stuff. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Those boys DID THEIR THING. I debated on trying chicken as I've never had it here and I've had the salmon before and thought about it again but opted for the steak.   No pictures, y'all. I thought about it but kept going as my greediness kicked in. Boom~   I must say, I'd rather have 2 sides because I can't resist the au gratin yet I'd love to try something else. I didn't see an option to add a side but they do allow you to add on soup or salad, lobster tail, crab cake, grilled shrimps..the usual add-on.   Either way, I like AJ's management style here so yeah I mean to try other places but never get around to making myself go.   I can't vouch for the pineapple infused martini as I didn't really taste any pina.",

Of coarse for some strange reason i don't care how many times i come here i always get the same dish which is the  encrusted salmon with friend spinach and mash potatoes. My mother had her heart set on ordering meatloaf so meatloaf it was for her. She mentioned the meatloaf was very tender and she would definitely order that meal again.

Everyone was friendly an our server was attentive. The food was terrible. My friend an I both got the Pepper Encrusted Sirloin. I got the seasoned fries an broccoli an my friend got a baked potato. I originally was looking at the salmon but didn't go with it because it was farm raised. When are food came to the table I was surprised the steak was already cut. I really don't understand why anyone would cut my steak which made it dry even with some sauce the put down and cold. The broccoli was over cooked and I'm still not sure if the fries were seasoned or not. My friend had to use the steak knife to butter the bread and cut her baked potato. Considering the prices, in addition to the location I expected better quality food. Have no desire to go back.",

Yea well that happened tonight when my dude convinced me to get muthafreakin Firebirds over some trusty Asian food. Why did I listen to him??? I'm laying in the bed right now, feenin for something.   I'm on a meat and veg diet... don't judge. It's working. Two lbs in two days baby!   Anywho I was craving some sort of meat and veg stir fry and what better place to get some than at an Asian joint. I said this out loud and as usual hubs chimes in with a bright idea. Only this time, not too bright, cause he suggested this spot.   I go for some wangs and a Cesar salad with a crab cake.   Wings: extremely crispy. Almost inedible. Also lukewarm, rather than hot. Barely any spice. I hate dry wings. Where's the sauce dammit! The first wing I bit into was all crispy skin. No meat. How thats possible, I don't know. The wings were also salty as shit. Like someone dropped a salt shaker in the bag and executed a poor attempt with rinsing them off. Blue cheese was good. Unfortunately that was the only highlight of that box of food.   Salad: lettuce looked good, fresh. The dressing was okay. I've had way better. Couldn't eat the croutons. You know... diet and all. It was a big portion.   Crab cake: tasted like your everyday, run of the mill, 2.5 star crab cake. Like something you would get from a subpar spot. Didn't expect the subpar ness for this joint. Ah well!    Service was good. From when I first ordered over the phone, to pick up. Class all the way.   Why lord! Why!!!   Y'all don't get it. I'm struggling. I want pasta, chocolate cake, tacos, grapes, grapefruit, ice cream, Futo Buta, a burger, pickles, a milkshake, bread, Spinach and artichoke dip, some popcorn, and some fries. Like I want all of that... like yesterday. The first couple weeks is the hardest. So my meat and veg game gotta be strong.    Damn firebirds! You really disappointed me. But you know what? Maybe in say 5-8 months I'll give you another shot. I'll try some real food from your menu. Maybe we can be friends. But you gotta promise me, you won't break my heart again, okay?   I'll see you soon. Keep a plate hot for me boo.",

I would have given this place 5 stars but when we originally arrived we were told by the hostess that unless we had a reservation, we had to wait over 30 minutes to sit even though there were many empty tables available. So, after sitting in the parking lot for a while I decided to check on yelp to see if I could book a reservation through open table. I did and there was a reservation for the exact time that we were trying to be seated. So basically, the hostess lied.   Aside from that, the customer service was great. The bartender was super nice about explaining the menu and letting me make last minute changes. The chicken quesadilla was really good and I like that the sour cream came on the side just in case I wanted to take it home and had to reheat it. The beef sliders were really good as well and there was a bar bites special for those.  The entire night I stuck with the double black diamond drink which was described as fresh  pineapple infused for 21 days w/ New Amsterdam and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice. It doesn't sound all of that great, but it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. And it was only $5 on Wednesday... I drank at least 3 or 4 because it was that good.",

I ordered the center cut sirloin medium well but it came put a little too pink so I sent it back to cook a little more. Well it came back to the table over cooked. I also added a side of grilled shrimp and they were very salty. I spoke to a manager and she just agreed the shrimp  seasoning is a little salty. I'm not sure if I'll be visiting again anytime soon.",

    "text": "I'm not one to write reviews. As an airline pilot I spend my life eating out and after 40 years of restaurant food, generally I've got nothing good to say. So something staggering had to happen for me to take the time to write this review. I've always had \"good\" experiences at Firebirds - generally at the Stonecrest location. I just had an \"unbelievably great\" experience at their sister location at SouthPark. For her 91st birthday dinner, my mother asked that my wife and I take her to a restaurant that serves roast prime rib. Knowing that it is difficult to find a restaurant in Charlotte that consistently prepares and serves good prime rib we knew Firebirds had it on its menu. I thought we would try the South Park location for a change. That decision unwittingly turned out to be brilliant. I called ahead to let them know of the occasion and its import. The two managers, Courtney and AJ, welcomed us with flowers as if it was their mother having the birthday. They remained attentive the entire evening. Kylie, our server was warm, charming, and extremely professional. The prime rib was spectacular and at the end of the evening the restaurant had a delicious cheesecake with a hand written birthday wish to my mother penned in icing. When the 'only' detraction to a magnificent dinner is \"a little too much dressing\" on your Caesar Salad, you've probably had a terrific dining experience. You never know how many birthday dinners you may have left to spend with your parents. I do know that this experience is one for the ages. Thank you Firebirds!",

The hostess put us in a secluded side room that had a party of men in there. Which wasn't horrible but they were the only party other than us in the room so it kind of felt like we were intruding. There were other tables open so we didn't understand. Soon another party if 8 came so it wasn't too awkward. We ordered the lobster quest to start, which was suggested by the waitress and a great item to share with people. All the food came out  in great time. We order the Prime Rib with the Au Gratin Potatoes and the Ribeye with the loaded bake potato. I think my favorite was the Prime Rib and the Au Gratin Potatoes were to die for. Each plate was a big portion so be ready to take some home. All in all it was a good experience.",

    "text": "Um, this time around was disappointing.   Decided to enjoy some dinner here on a Friday evening and surprised that it was only a 30 minute wait. Once I was seated, I was excited to get my drink order in and order an appetizer. Our table was finally greeted by our waiter for the evening, James. We received drinks and he said the he would be back with straws... after 12 minutes, we got those straws. Afterwards, he walked off and proceeded to help other tables without even stopping by to see if we were ready to order or answering any questions we may have. I also now realized that we were informed of any specials, as he'd done with other tables. Finally, I was over it and called him by name the um-tenth time that was preparing to walk past our table and asked if he was ready to take our order. We placed our orders and he walked off. By this time, I'm not happy at all because I've frequented this location numerous times and never experienced such awful customer service. Meanwhile, we never received bread... it was only after I pointed it out to him that we'd not gotten any that he said, it was in the oven only to return 1.5 minutes later with luke warm bread; must've been an easy-bake oven.   The straw that broke the camel's back for me...after consistently walking past our table, he proceeded to take a group picture for the party next to us and stepped between my seat and the wall... unavoidably bumping my chair and holding the phone over my head to take the perfect shot! No, sir!   Let me tell you how the manager, Jeremy SAVED this location from us WALKING OUT and gaining 2 stars for an already 1 star review I'd drafted on my phone!!!   Jeremy walked over to ask if everything was ok (by this time we'd received cold Lobster Spinach Queso from our waiter)... I introduced myself and informed him of the unpleasant experience my table was having so far, along with needing a refill and being used as a standing point for a photo-op. Jeremy apologized, replaced our appetizer with a warm one and stated that he would inform our waiter to correct the errors made. Our waiter promptly returned to ask if we needed anything but I was seriously just over it! There was clear bias with how our table was treated versus those that he assumed he would get larger tips from. As a reminder, great tips are generated from great service, but I digress.   Thank you Jeremy for representing the level of service all Firebirds staff should be performing, unfortunately it may be a while before I visit this location again!",

We were 4, my in laws, my husband and I. The whole experience was different from my last one. The service was excellent our glasses were always being refilled, the table was cleaned and not only our waitress checked on us many times but one of the managers too. We had the ranch rings as appetizer, which is to die for. This is my favorite dish on their menu. Even my husband and his mom that don't eat onions this is the only kind that they do and love. The onion rings are so crispy and delicious and the ranch is out of this world, simple amazing. My husband and my father in law chose the Smokehouse Burger, my mother in law went with the French Dip and I picked the Center Cut Sirloin with the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes and I also had soup of the day the was Beef Vegetable Barley. My soup was really good, just on point to a cold day. The Smokehouse Burgers were cooked to perfection, this is my husband favorite dish. I really love they way it looks when it's platted I am just more a Steak lover kind of person so maybe one day I will order a Smokehouse Burger to myself. This is the first time the my father in law had a Burger at Firebirds and he really enjoyed it, he kept saying how great his food was. My mother in law also enjoyed her food, was the biggest French Dip that I even seen, and if she says a French Dip is good you. Enter believe her because it is one of her favorite things to eat. My Steak was better than the first time I went to Firebirds. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the spicy gave it a special flavor. I REALLY wanted to try their desserts but we all were so full that unfortunately we could not eat it. In the first 10 minutes we had our drinks, appetizer and bread. Our food took 40 minutes to get done but as I said the place was packed, they had multiple parties with 6 or more, which impressed me since it was a Wednesday night and not weekend or holiday. Overall the food was good, the service excellent and we will definitely be back specially because I can't stop thinking about that warm chocolate brownie. After our bad experience in Durham their Regional Manager contact me to apologize and sent me VIP cards to visit any location in North Carolina, even though on my review I said that I would give a chance to one of their restaurants in Charlotte to check the difference between locations. When I gave the cards to the waitress she called one of the managers, Ian his name, and he came to check on us and to know what happened in Durham and to confirm if we had a great experience last night.  I can assure you that YES, we had a great experience I've decided to give another try to the restaurant in Durham next time I am up there. Firebirds has the best customer service that I've ever seen in a restaurant and I wish other places cared about their customers like them.",

My server was very friendly and came by enough for my needs to be met but not so much that it was annoying. I ordered the beef sliders, crispy ribs and fired up shrimp. The shrimp was probably my favorite. It was a good combination of sweet and spicy. My second favorite was the ribs. I liked the unexpected flavor of a sweet rib. My least favorite were the sliders. The beef was overcooked which I thought was interesting since I wasn't asked how I wanted them cooked. I also ordered the double black diamond and the liquid sunshine; both of which I enjoyed.

Pretty empty, only a few people in the bar area. First thing I noticed when I walked in the door was the huge pineapple infused drink happening on the counter...so that leads me to the cocktails which I will talk about first.   Cocktails - so their signature drink is \"The Black Diamond\" a pineapple infused vodka cocktail. AMAZING. Menu price is $10.50 but we came during happy hour (we didn't even know that) and it was only $5! Can't be that. I may be back just to drink some more, we had 3.   Apps - we had the coconut shrimp, very good! You get 5 I think, served with a special sauce (that was spicy) and a \"slaw\" (thin tortilla chips with carrots and lettuce). Someone at our table said \"nah I don't like coconut.\" Well guess what? He tried one, and he did in fact like coconut shrimp.   Entree- I had a 7oz filet mignon which was grilled to perfection. The taste was perfect. It was wrapped in bacon, cooked just right, texture was perfect, and the taste....was well the best I think I've ever had. Or that I can remember right now. Served with your choice of side: broccoli, steak fries, or garlic mashed potatoes. I had the potatoes, and they were pretty good.   I'll be back, eventually. For steak or cocktails, or maybe both.",

Their meatloaf is made from premium beef like Kobe but comes with mashed potatoes and is very good. I don't like how high the prices have risen but the service makes up for it. Don't leave without trying the creme  brulee cheesecake",

    "text": "Three words: LOBSTER SPINACH QUESO.  I am such a huge fan of Firebirds. I think their food is delicious. I always have a great experience with every visit.   I've had pretty much everything on the menu. I don't really think you can order wrong here. Their seasonal menus are always great. Their lobster spinach queso is my favorite app. The wings are also crazy good here. Their ranch rings are underrated (that roasted garlic ranch dressing, yes). I highly recommend the salmon (the flavor from the wood grill is amazing) and basically all their steaks. My go to: the slow roasted prime rib. Holy. The Southwest Au Gratin potatoes and port mushrooms are both yummy. I also love to start every meal with a BLT salad. JUST GIVE ME ALL THE FOOD.   I'm not a huge dessert person, but I will make someone at the table order a sweet treat to share. Creme Brulee Cheesecake and Warm Chocolate Brownie (guys, it has both salted caramel sauce AND dark chocolate sauce) are both worth every calorie.   Mondays- half price wine, Wednesdays- drink specials all day. Monday-Friday there are bar bite specials 4-6:30pm in the Firebar and on the patio (philly cheesesteak egg rolls and crispy cauliflower are both great).   Shout out to AJ, the general manager. Such a good guy and also works his ass off in that place. He's always running around, making sure everyone's experience is top notch.",

Our server, Preston, was adorable. He had this cute dry humor and was very attentive. Ask for him when you go.   The chicken Cobb salad is my absolute favorite. But don't be fooled because it's a salad. It is super filling. The plate comes filled with fresh chopped greens, fried chicken pieces, eggs, bacon and a nice ranch dressing. It comes with tomatoes but I order mine without them. Seriously the salad is so big and filling that halfway through my friend and I always joke that we're tired of chewing. It's delicious and a great value at $13. Hubby enjoyed his salmon salad, too. I didn't get to taste it so I can't review it.",

What a nice place, the entrance into the bar area is so pretty with a wall of colorful backlit bottles and high top tables.  It's a classy place but not pretentious- comfortable and warm. The dining room had several open tables and booths but they filled up a few minutes later with large and small groups and a few families. We found several things that looked so good but decided on a burger- what a huge meal, a filet mignon, a shrimp salad with sugar sauteed pecans and strawberries and finally a shrimp salad with bacon. All of us loved our meals.  It was 1/2 off Monday so that was a cool discount on wine.  We had great attentive service everything was perfectly prepared too. Our local friends confirmed-- Yes it is always so good!  The finishing touch was a warmed brownie, with caramel sauce and ice cream- We shouldn't have- but it was worth every bite!  with decaf...the end to a great meal!",

My husband ordered the Cheeseburger and Fries overall it was good, his only complaint was they only have about 15 fries.   Our service and server were great! Very attentive to our needs and prompt.   There were 2 downfalls: 1.) the restaurant was very warm (I know they cook on a wood fire grill, that's sort of out in the open), maybe they should consider lowering the temperature.  2.) The entrance near the bar area needed much attention. There was debris all over the floor.   We've dined at this Firebirds many times and will continue.",

Not sure why it took so long.   Once we sat down they had one server come over to get our drink order but we just sat down so didn't even have time to look at the drink menu. Came back a while later and gave our order. Then we had a different person come to take a food order. We didn't know what we wanted at that time so we asked for them to come back. It took a while for them to come back to take our order. He wasn't the most friendly waiter nor did he check on us after placing our order. There wasn't many people in the restaurant that he was busy. It seemed like he was annoyed we had come in to get food.   The bar set up looked really cool but didn't have a huge selection of local craft beer on tap which was a disappointment for me. They had more of a selection in bottles and cans.",

My husband had the French dip the 2nd time and loved it.  The bread comes out hot and is delicious.  The dessert is even more scrumptious!  We had the key lime pie twice.  So creamy and light!  Rebecca bought our dessert.  We were totally happy when we left as our stomachs were satisfied from the beginning to the end.  Very reasonable prices for such quality meals!

But... 2)  Sometimes, we want to eat a nice meal out, but have to take the children (9 and 6) with us (not my first choice for a nice meal to be sure, but you gotta eat)... which can be a really tricky act.  They like to go out, but they're not THAT well behaved... and some restaurants make this work and some really, really don't.  And it's often VERY hard to tell what'll  do and what won't.  BUT you also have to be careful with \"kid-friendly\" or you'll get Chuck E Cheese - money I'd rather not spend.  So, we ventured out with children in tow and total of three adults.... Food at our table included: Lobster Spinach Queso (very nice!) Chicken Tortilla Soup Caesar Salad French Dip Smokehouse Burger ..and children ate grilled cheese and chicken strips - with homemade lemonade (a very nice touch) which was reported to be excellent.  All were flawlessly executed in ample portions (I was full hours later, no dinner necessary).  The atmosphere is upscale casual - a great balance of \"new and expensive\" with \"relaxed and inviting\".  Service was on point - prompt and friendly but not overly familiar.  The wood grill and open kitchen set up provides a nice interest point and a wonderful (not overpowering) aroma and ambience.  Great meal, be sure you're hungry and enjoy!",

    "text": "My original review was is listed in the next paragraph, but i wanted to update this to reflect the generiousity of corporate Firebirds.  Less than 24 hours after writting my review I was contacted by someone in Firebirds that both called and emailed me to express their apologies for the service I experienced.  This was very nice and unexpected.  They offered to credit my transaction, though I declined because I did eat and it was not fair.  However, they said they would like to send me some gift cards for my troubles.  I thanked them expecting not to see anything.  A few days later I received $50 gift card to give them a try again and another $50 gift card for another restaurant in the area.  Though my service was very bad the first time I visted this place they're corporate staff went over and above to resolve the issue and redeem themselves for the incident.  Because they were so nice and responsive I will be making a point to go back and give them a fair and honest second review not taking into consideration my first experience.  Review to follow in coming weeks.  I waited 45 minutes for 2 appetizers because they were out of the prime rib.  I was by myself.  The food was just fine, worth the price and slightly better than I expected.  None the less I was ignored and they brought my food extremely late.  Managers even noticed and asked me if I needed anything, but didn't offer anything, which is not typical (free app or drink, or something).  I paid full price and did not tip, only the second time in my life.  Worst service ever!  I gave them 2 stars only because their food was good and they were not worth 1.",

Waitress was excellent - only complaint and it has happened more often than not - upon opening the red wine, they try to push the cork back into the bottle!!!  We always wait until they leave and then remove the cork but that would be part of the wine presentation course!  Like they do not serve wine at room temperature - coming from California I was astonished upon moving here how many of the upscale places serve red wine at room temperature - slightly chilled please!  Manager came over to make sure all was good - food was served quickly and exactly as ordered",

I ate what I could and when the waiter came to remove our plates I mentioned that the prime rib was not good at all. The waiter apologized and said he would let his manager know. A few minutes later the manager, named Joe came to the table and asked me to tell him what was wrong with the prime rib. I explained that it was hard to cut and chew and that it looked like an end piece and that I didn't order an end piece. He apologized and agreed and told me that they don't serve end pieces unless the customer specifically asks for it. At the end of our conversation he told me that my meal was taken care of. I will definitely come back because of that excellent customer service experience.",

And while the server didn't offer after the plates were cleared, we REQUESTED a wet nap for post-ribs cleanup.  We were VERY surprised when a hot wet towel came to the table - much more effective and much more pleasant than a disposable wet nap in an impossible to open package!  Kudos to Firebirds - but offer this before it's requested!  Those who don't think to ask will appreciate it.",

I had the crab cake salad and mom had the cilantro grilled chicken breast.  Firebird's salad are always a good pick.  They have a great variety, from fried chicken, grilled chicken, shrimp, and crab cakes added to a really fresh mixed green salad.  The cilantro lime vinaigrette is a must.  However, I was a little disappointed with the crab cakes today, a lot of bread crumbs and filler and not very much meat.  I don't know if it is a new measure to cut cost, but not as good as it once was.  On the other hand the cilantro chicken was tender and grilled perfectly.  I will of course go back to Firebirds, but probably won't order the crab cake salad again.",

We should have saw the slow response coming because he took awhile to wait on us once we sat down. We finally ordered and the food took a good minute to come. We had the smoke chicken appetizer with the sauce on the side. The bread is good too. It was a butt bread!  lol  We tried the coconut shrimp with fries. The meal comes with two sides and I went with all French fries. Now we know that means double on the fries but I guess they didn't know that because we only got about 10 fries on the plate. I guess since they are a little big they only give you small amounts. We tried the fresh squeeze lemonade which was not fresh squeeze since it turned out to have spirit mixed in with it. I don't know how it is fresh squeeze and hand made lemonade.. huh  I don't know!!  It was a bit tangy to the taste, so I ordered some sweet tea. It was great! :) Then we needed ketchup for the fries. It seem like the waiter had to go to the store to pick it up. It took a good while before he bought us the ketchup. Once we had our ketchup we were good to go. The ambience and the restaurant itself is nice. We may return... hoping to get a different waiter. I guess the 3 tables of five people were just a bit to much for him tonight.",

Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The prime rib was a good sized piece and was cooked just the way i wanted it. The baked potato was very good too. I have never had a bad meal at Firebirds.  The only miss of the night was that I was surprised they didn't bring a comp dessert for my dad it was his birthday.

I also loved the mashed potatoes which came server recommended...and were worth every calorie (and boy was there calories!)

I should have taken a clue from the other guest at the table when everyone buy my wife and I ordered a fish dish for their entree. I ordered the Spinach Salad with the extra add on of their Crab Cakes and the Sirloin Steak with Baby Portobello Mushrooms The salad was great, the dressing very complementary with the spinach salad, but the crab cakes were tasteless, and were twice the cost of the salad to be added on. They were supposed to be seasoned with Old Bay Seasoning for flavor. I don't think they remembered to add it to mine or to my wife's crab cake appetizers. We both thought they were bland and tasteless. My wife asked for her steak to be done medium rare, my  steak was to be done medium. Both of our steaks were overcooked. Her steak came out Medium, my steak came out burnt meat matter well done grey, (YUCK) The Baby Portobello's were plentiful but needed to be better seasoned and cooked longer. I like mushrooms that are not Al dente. The Parmesan crusted Mahi Mahi was the hit of the table. If I go back again this will be what I order. The flavor of the crust was perfect, The fish was a fresh thick filet cooked to perfection.  Two of the quests ordered the Pecan Encrusted Trout, And one ordered the Simiply Grilled Mahi. They all raved about how good there food tasted, that I regretted not getting a fish entree My wife tried their house special Pineapple Martini and thought it was good but not great  she still prefers the Lemon Drop Martinis.",

Both of those locations got me hooked on firebirds.  The firebird's at this location, however, as noted by the past couple of reviews seems to be a bit below the standard expected. The food is great. It's the service that I feel can be improved.   The hostess are polite enough but neither of them in the numerous times I have gone have greeted me or thanked me for dining there. Every time I am finished eating and walking towards the exit, I am the first to say thank you, otherwise the hostess usually doesn't say a word. This isn't the biggest of deals but when you are spending decent money, I feel like the hospitality should be kicked up a notch.  On my last visit (two days ago) we dined late and were seated promptly. My date noticed that the floor was quite dirty with pieces of food and trash. She didn't make a big deal out of it, but I know this restaurant can do better.   The food is fantastic, the hospitality and cleanliness could use some work.",

So I took them up on it yesterday, my birthday.   Got there around 2PM solo and sat in the bar to watch football. I ordered the Grilled Tenderloin Salad:  Grilled and sliced beef tenderloin over a bed of mixed greens tossed with bleu cheese crumbles, diced tomatoes and a tangy balsamic vinaigrette with a glass of Simi chardonnay. I also opted for some bread since I was going to do without dessert.   Can I just tell you how freaking much I loved this salad! And their dressing was so yummy, I was think of do shots with it!   The meat was cooked to my perfection (med/rare) and Simi wine was de-lish. Oh and their freshly baked bread should be banned! I could have eaten several of them, but I was good since I dieting.   I can't wait to get that salad and wine combo again - maybe I will use my VIP card they handed out at the Yelpy happy hour.   Oh, and my waiter/bartendar was fab as well!!!   Thanks Firebirds!",

The Lobster Spinach Queso is so good with the homemade chips and also the Ranch Rings. My go to meals are the Salmon and the Ribeye!! So flavorful and the portion sizes are sure to fill you up! Their steaks are so tender. If you ask me one of the best steaks around. They also have really good drinks. I suggest the Sangria and the Pomegranate Sunrise. Service is always fast and they are always friendly. Once I baked a cake for a birthday dinner and they put it in the Refrigerator for me. My cake was falling apart because I didn't let it cool appropriately before leaving the house. When I asked for them to bring it out, they put candles in it to try to make it look as presentable as possible. It wasn't necessary as we just wanted them to bring it out but it was soo hilarious!! It looked so ridiculous, We loved them for that. Can't go wrong here.",

She did not bother to even say the usual \"Hey guys! welcome to Firebirds\" or any of that. Just grabbed the menus and started walking towards a table.. that just brought the entire vibe down.   When our waiter came, we got the same negative energy from him but he warmed up a little towards the end. Seems like they were all tired and ready to go home. I can say the coconut margarita was amazing and the food actually made up for all the bad attitudes we received. Might go back again but not to this location.",

The ahi tuna starter I had was actually pretty good and completed with a rosemary spice which I found to be refreshingly different.    The service was a little all over the place.  I'm not sure if the bartender (our waiter) was just having an off day but he barely knew the beers on tap and seemed to forget about us after a while.  Again, it was an off hour for lunch so that might have been the overall issue.",

The salmon was cooked to perfection and the spinach salad house dressing was out of this world!

    "text": "Firebirds has solid food but not anything that really stands out. I've never had a bad meal here but I've also never had an amazing one. Firebirds the type of restaurant you go to when a) you're dining with someone with a less adventurous palate or b) you're in a big group and want a variety of entrees to choose from.  They have a fairly large menu of basic anerican standbys: fish, chicken, steaks, and burgers. They do all of these things fairly well from my experience and I've been here many times since my mom loves this place. I'm not a liquor drinker but I've heard their cocktails are good.  The reason that firebirds isn't in four star territory is that the food, though fresh and decent quality, just isn't that flavorful. Based on their current menu, it looks like they're trying to do more creative things with their good by offering various sauces and different encrusted fishes but they just haven't mastered using these flavors to enhance the food. Case in point: I got the chili rubbed delmonico last time I was there but didn't taste any chili though the steak itself was solid. I had a similar issue with the green chili mac and cheese (a shame because green chili is awesome and not something that shows up often in restaurants outside the southwest).  In summary, thus isn't a place I ever choose to go to on my own but I also don't protest when my mother inevitably suggests it during my visits.",

Servers here are more friendly and much more attentive than \"Bricktops\"!  Firebirds Servers know their Menu better than both the others!  Don't you hate going to eat at a place where you know the Menu better than the Servers?!?  On Food Quality Firebirds is Very Good, very similar to the competition!  On Food Flavor, FireBirds competition wins on almost EVERYTHING, yet Firebirds (at least this location) continues to improve!  I have eaten here more than other Firebirds locations (I have eaten at the Stonecrest Location three times, North Lake Mall two times and Winston Salem once)...  Baby Back Ribs Quality 5 stars... The Flavor is Very Good, though the Sauce is not good enough for these Ribs!  \"Brick Tops\" wins first place and \"131 Main\" gets a close 2nd place, Firebirds loses on flavor, still they are very good, close to 4 stars... These would be 5 star Ribs if the Sauce were better...  BBQ Sauce (Java) sounds like it could beat almost anyone, it does not!... 3.4 stars  Slaw (Tricolor Tortilla, Purple Cabbage, with Roasted Pumpkin Seeds wins over \"Brick Tops\" and \"131 Main\"... Slaw is not that important to me!  Baked Potatos are much better here than \"Bricktops\" (Bricktops has been known to not serve Baked Potatoes at Lunch and run out of them at Dinner, when they do have them they are not that good... One of the Bricktops Managers said Baked Potatoes are not that popular with their customers AND that Baked Potatoes are Labor Intensive, they really only want to serve Fries!  Firebirds Steak Fries 3 stars  Firebirds Sweet Potato Waffle Fries 3 stars  In the War of the Fries (their is one in the World of Rod0) Bricktops beats almost everyone (not counting those who use Goat Fat, Coconut Oil or Lard) 131 Main has Very Good Fries too, though I would not go just for those!  Onion Rings 3 stars - \"CowFish\" and \"Red Rocks\" win the Fried Onion Awards, Roosters could compete well here too!  Key Lime Pie - Bricktops beats everyone in this category - NOTE to The Owners of Firebirds, start with a new Crust, best thing to do is go to Bricktops and get inspired!  I would rather be eating here than either of the competitors and that is why I keep coming back here... My friends and Family want to go to Bricktops because the food is better... Do NOT be afraid of your competition, you have them beat in Service by a LONG shot!!!  Go in their and get a piece of Pie... OR you could have a Public \"Stand-off\", don't do that you are not ready for it!  2nd Note to the Owners tweak your BBQ sauce or CHANGE IT COMPLETELY!  Bricktops is Beating you here and I'll tell you a Secret and it is NOT a Bricktops Secret it is and \"OUTLAW\" Secret : : Peppercorn Blend!!!  Your Ribs are HIGH Quality and Deserve e a better Sauce!!!  You can do this...if so many people like your BBQ sauce keep it and make an improved one and see what happens!  3rd Note to the Owners - This one IS Personal!  I WANT YOU to WIN!!!",

    "text": "Without fail - every. single. time. when I order take out or use a delivery service, my meal is wrong. Even a salad is wrong. I'm not sure if it's sloppiness or carelessness but it's getting worse and is increasingly becoming more frustrating.  Wait times times for take out are also increasing - even at off peak times. I'd be ok with the additional wait if orders were actually correct.",

    "text": "Amazing food and atmosphere!   Tried the coconut shrimp as an appetizer, there were only 5 for two people and a giant pile of slaw which wasn't very good alone.  The blue cheese filet is superb. If you haven't had the BLT salad, I highly recommend that as well.   Our waiter was very confident and knowledgable, it was very refreshing.",

    "text": "I went here for Happy Hour drinks ($5-7) and appetizers ($5-10) with friends. They have great prices on \"bar bites\" during happy hour, which includes tacos, sliders, dips (pimento cheese or crab), and a few other options. We went for the tacos which was a perfect choice for the three of us there, and I had the white sangria - sweet and delicious, then a Double Black Diamond signature drink with pineapple infused vodka. We had a fourth friend join and it turned into a dinner for us. We all ended up splitting meals: two of us split the beef tenderloin pasta and the other two split a burger. The restaurant nicely split the meals into two separate plates, which was great! The portions were perfect and the pasta was well prepared with red peppers and a green chile cheese sauce.",

    "text": "The salmon on the Strawberry salad is never completly cooked even if you ask them to make sure it is. Must be new cooks but mgmt needs to take notice since this can be a very dangerous meal to consume uncooked seafood that is not sushi grade. Ive told the manager on duty @ least 3 times so now its my fault for continuing to order.",

    "text": "We picked this place for a work dinner since the menu was extensive.     We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees and I really can't complain about the food.   It was solid, not super fancy, but more like a Cheesecake Factory chain restaurant.   BUT.... I still dream about the Creme Brule cheesecake.  Holy cheesecake that is good.  We ended up ordering another cheesecake because I just needed to eat more.  Another standout is the lemonade.  It's not overly sweet and supports Alex's Lemonade stands.   Good lemonade for a good cause. Kudos.",
