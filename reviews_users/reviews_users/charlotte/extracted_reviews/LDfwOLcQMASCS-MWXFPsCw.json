The bad: they stopped giving the cheese dip gratis. They don't have a license to sell beer on Sunday.  They dropped all beer specials. They seem to have product inventory management issues, almost always out of something.  The service is inconsistent, yet with the same staff?    Altogether, still very decent mex food for Fort Mill, with a few things to overlook but if it's about the food and not a lot more, try the flautas",

    "text": "I've been here at least 3 times hoping it would be a better experience than the last but it has yet to occur. This time was the last straw for us - we sit down and order a pitcher of top shelf margaritas...but no our waitress tells us that tonight is buy one get one free margaritas which would be cheaper so of course we take her up on that and still request top shelf. About ten minutes later with no drinks, the manager comes over and says \"So you have some questions about the margaritas?\".  We say no and repeat our order and she goes on to inform us that they only have pre-mixed margaritas. Well, that sucked but okay would have been nice if our waitress knew that and told us. So we tell the manager the pre-mixed is fine. About 15 minutes later we still have no drinks, which was odd since they were pre-mixed? I mean people who came in after us and ordered margaritas had gotten them already. So we ask our waitress if they were still coming and she informs is that \"it is not my responsibility\".  Um - you are our waitress, regardless if you can't serve us it is still your responsibility to get us drinks. Another 10 minutes go by and I ask our waitress to please ask her manager (who is responsible for the margaritas?) if our margaritas are coming - she does and the manager goes on to inform us that they were out of this pre-mixed margarita and we're making more (so much for pre-mixed, they might as well have made our top shelf drinks).  So now that we've been there 30 minutes with no drinks, our food comes out while we are still drink less. Mind you, the food is decent here but the staff and drinks are horrible. We do finally get our drinks about 5 minutes after receiving our food (it was also wrong from what we ordered). The margaritas were junk. It tasted like straight mix with no tequila. We are a group of avid drinkers and we left them all pretty much as we got them - full glasses. By the time we are finally ready to go and get our bill - we were charged for 4 margaritas. Um, hello? You told us it was buy one get one free Ms. Waitress. NOPE only if you get a small or something which our waitress never informed us about. We literally took her up on the suggestion of the buy one get one free with no mention of what size we wanted. So after 20 minutes of just trying to get it fixed the manager doesn't even bother coming over but passes along word we can have 10 bucks off. Pitiful service and drinks - I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a staff that knows what they're doing or actually know what their restaurant does and doesn't have or even if you're looking for a semi decent margarita. The food is decent though which is the only reason I can give them 2 stars.",

We had great service. They really took the time to make sure we had everything we needed. All of the staff members were extremely friendly. The food was AWESOME. They give you chips, salsa, and a green dip (cilantro salsa) when you first sit down which tasted great. I ordered the La Unica Burrito without the red sauce, with beef, and a side of rice and beans. It tasted great. Rice was probably the best rice I have had at a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the pollo fundido. He always orders this at every Mexican restuarant. He said he was disappointed that the cheese on it was shredded/melted instead of the cheese dip, so you may want to request the cheese dip instead. Overall a great experience. We sat at the bar and they let us put the game on we wanted to watch and gave us the remote to turn up the volume. I will go back for sure. We stayed at the Best Western and walked right over. Super awesome. We did both order margaritas. There was too much sweet and sour mix for my taste. I am just not a big fan of places that pre-make their mix with the alcohol already in it. They were not super strong, but not super weak either. I think next time I will ask for an extra shot in it though. Try it out.",

    "text": "I do not like to give bad reviews, but thanks to the manager/ owner of this place, here we go... For a Mexican restaurant, they had no way of making a top shelf margarita, no sweet tea, and I waited much too long for the drink I did order. The tacos were less than appetizing, and were very chewy. I understand now why the place was almost empty at dinner time. Upon leaving, my check, to my surprise, was unbelievable. Food cost was $10. 4 shots cost $42!!! I thought there was a mistake, but the manager insisted that shots were-no matter- $10 each. I guess someone has to finance his taste for Tacate, which he openly drank at the bar in front of myself and the sparse amount of customers. I specifically chose the hotel because this restaurant was conveniently located inside. Unfortunately, both the hotel and the restaurant will lose my company's business from tthis day forward due to the fact that the establishment chooses to charge upscale prices for less than mediocre results. The servers were great. I only wish that they worked somewhere as great as they are. Good luck, ladies... 4 tacos. 4 shots. = $42.50 plus tip I won't be back, and would suggest anyone staying at the Clairion at Carowinds to beware. Of you stay here, please do yourself a favor and eat at Culvers or the KFC. You will be very disappointed if you eat at this place!!!",

    "text": "Very different pulling up to a hotel and knowing that this restaurant is here. When you walk inside the friendly staff greets you and gets you seated right away. It is a decent size restaurant with lots of tables inside. You get chips and 3 different kinds of salsa and they also give you a free dish of queso. Our second batch of chips came out fresh and hot. But seconds cost you a couple dollars. I'm from California it's hard to find good authentic Mexican  restaurants out here and this is by far the best I've had. Doesn't completely meet the whole home standards of Mexican food just didn't have that great great authentic taste but it's the best I've had out here. The tortas are HUGE. The waitress brought out my girlfriends plate and we had to ask if she got the order right. I had never seen a torta as big as the one we received. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was very delicious. A friend ordered the carna asada quiesdilla and that thing was huge as well.  The horchata was also very delicious. Very good prices and you get leftovers because the portion are so big. I took half my chimichanga home. For a carna asada torta and a chicken chimichanga and a big to go cup of horchata it was 15 dollars.",

Went for lunch with a few friends and two of us ordered the barbacoa burrito. It was gross. Not only did it not taste anything like barbacoa, but just looking at the meat was gag inducing. It was gray and gelatinous. Not good at all.   Our waitress was very nice but also very incompetent. She brought out the chips and salsas, which are served in small carafes, but brought no bowls. She had trouble taking the order, she didn't check on us, never informed us that the checks go to the desk and you pay there - she just wasn't great.   Additionally, and everyone has their opinions, but I find the location to be pretty shifty. There are people in and near that hotel that don't seem on the up and up!  Park at your own risk!",

    "text": "Taqueria La Unica is definitely a hidden gem.  Don't let the run down location (connected to the Clarion Hotel) put you off because the food is crazy good here.  I drive past at least 4 other Mexican places to come to this one.  I tend to be a creature of habit at Mexican restaurants and get the same things.  However, I've tried several different things here and it makes me want to try more.  They have terrific authentic tacos here (most of which are only $1 if you come on Tuesday!!).  The carnitas and beef tongue tacos are my favorites.  The carne asada is so well prepared and the bean soup that comes with it is the bees knees!  I've also ordered the shrimp ceviche which was tasty and well seasoned.  I normally don't order taquitos as restaurants because they are bland, but the ones here have fantastically seasoned taco meat with a perfectly crispy tortilla.  While you only get one basket of chips for free, you get three different salsas to snack on while you wait for your food - a mild tomato, a spicy avocado green, and a spicy chipotle tomato salsa.  All of them are tasty and I'd put the spicy sauces at about 6/10 in spiciness (whereas the mild is about 1-2 depending on the day).  I think you can also get a free small queso with your chips upon request (it says so on the menu, but we only got it on our very first visit).  Their margaritas are pretty standard, nothing special.  If you order the $7 one, I've found that it comes out pretty strong if you like one with plenty of tequila.  Overall, this is some of the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte.  While the hotel and the parking lot are rough-looking, the inside of this place is clean, bright, and not worn down.  There are plenty of tables here.  Service has been great and friendly on every visit so far.  I was hesitant to come here the first time because of the strange and run down location, but it was really such a terrific surprise.  Prices are average (most meals are in the $8-11 range) but the food quality is very good for the price.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I highly recommend this place, especially for $1 Taco Tuesdays!",

Overall, I would come back even if it's not a Taco Tuesday.  Go check them out!",

    "text": "I'd heard from two different sources how great this place was and finally was in the area at lunch time. The outside is deceiving, ugly parking lot and exterior. Inside is very clean and wide open. Upon entry I was immediately greeted and seated by a young man, very nice. I started browsing the menu which was extensive, settled on mole enchiladas. Prices are minuscule for the amount of food you get, 7-8 dollars for 3 enchiladas with rice and beans! The enchiladas were good, mole sauce was very sweet but I still enjoyed it. The beans and rice were both kind of blah for me. My real issue was the service. Our server was very nice but never came by after we ordered and I was dying for a refill. Also when ready to leave it took 10+ minutes to get the check and pay it. I'd probably try it again in hopes of slightly better service and order something different if I'm in the area.",

The salsa was fresh as it gets and really tasty. Easily the best I've ever had.   I ordered the fajita quesadilla. The thing was massive but I will never be beaten by food. It tasted awesome, mi spousa ordered chori pollo and she loved it. I snagged some too and really enjoyed it too.   Like I said previously, we are new to the area and still finding our feet and are going to try a couple of other places but if this meal was anything to go by I reckon we will definitely be back.   Two words: ALGO BIEN!",

I started to dip my chip in the guacamole container my wife had just opened, when she grabbed my wrist in horror and says, \"What the hell..\" I look closer and there is a fly in the guac. A LIVE FLY. Crawling around, marinating in the guac. The fly didn't even look fully mature...which means: eggs/infestation. Needless to say, we were so disgusted; we promptly shut all the boxes and containers...and that was the end of our \"meal\". No way we are eating anything from that kitchen. My poor wife was actually still swallowing her very first bite of the food/guac when she saw the fly making its way up the container. I still feel very queasy as I'm writing this.",

Taqueria La Unica is located in the dingy parking lot of The Clarion Hotel at Carowinds and The Best Western.   The inside of Taqueria La Unica is bright and vibrant. A few tables were occupied around Noon. We received complimentary Queso, Spicy guacamole sauce and salsa! So delish! I can't believe we received all three! Winning! The floors and tables are SUPER clean! Our waitress was great! She recommended quite a few options to us.  My first order of business, Margarita's!!!!! $7 bucks by the way!!! YASSS Please! The menu offers a great selection of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tortas and much more. My husband and I decided to order tacos. I had four tacos....with no shame! Two Carne Asada's and two Al Pastors. The Al Pastors were my favorite! I LOVE Pork! The smokey flavor was life changing! The Carne Asada's were okay, the steak was a little dry. Each taco was perfectly crafted on a homemade corn tortilla shell. Topped with onions and fresh cilantro. My husband orders three tacos, two Carnita's and one Tripita (AKA Chitterlings). HA! He only ate half of the Tripita.   Overall we had a great experience, I definitely look forward to coming here again soon!",

The soft drinks are a bit stiff at $2.49... but they come to the table in large cups so at least you do not need constant refills. Taco Tuesdays are the best! $1 tacos with a purchase of a drink. 3 tacos and drink out the door for $6!  Been there multiple times since and it just keeps getting better.  Today (1/3/2019) they had some new kind of red sauce today as well - Tomotae de diablo (?) is at the top of their hot list, but the flavor was awesome as well. Made with diablo peppers and sauted fresh tomatoes. Can't recommend it more.",

    "text": "I wanted to take my co-worker to lunch for her birthday and I wanted Mexican. So I got to my trusty Yelp app and this place popped up and had pretty decent reviews so why not. I live in Fort Mill and didn't know this place was even here and I love me some Mexican food. It was also Taco Tuesday. Like most of the other reviews this place is inside the Clarion hotel so don't be alarmed; my advice is to park on the back side because if you go through the front you have to walk through the hotel, they don't mind but I thought I would save you the trouble. The food was delicious I got the Carne Asada and the pork tacos if you want cheese and sour cream that's extra. I got a margarita which was very tasty but I couldn't finish it because I thought I was getting the small one and as I mentioned I was on my lunch break. I will definitely be going back soon, maybe even today for lunch.",

    "text": "This is located within a hotel.  Don't let the exterior fool you, this is a great place.  Panchito's Mexican Grill is the old La Unica with a new name.  The interior is the same and the menu and food is the same.  The service is friendly and fast.  The food is better than the other chains in the area.  The only difference from the former name/owners are that I wasn't served cheese dip with the chips and salsa.  I'm not sure what happened, but this name change had me worried until I finished lunch here.  This place is still fantastic.  (It's strange too, I literally ate here a week ago under the old name.)",
