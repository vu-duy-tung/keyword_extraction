Some people may describe it as \"hipster\" serving only craft beers etc. Though I don't think its a bad thing.   Staff were quite friendly and engaging. Though for a crepe restaurant, their selection of crepes were quite limited. I ordered the Queen City crepe which was burst of flavor, the purple slaw on the side was also very good. The section of cocktails looked excellent too. One of the better restaurants in CLT.",

    "text": "I visited this location last night with a friend.  My reviews of the Crepe Cellar certainly did not do it justice.  We decided to try several different small dishes (tapas style) and I'm so glad we did.  It was fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!  First, we ordered the pesto Brie fries and oysters.  The pesto Brie fries were just as amazing as the first time I had them.  I think the only thing I would mention about those is that there was a lot of oil from the pesto.  However, the fries were still good enough to lick the plate if needed.  The oysters were absolutely the best oysters my friend and I (combined) had ever tasted.  The oysters were cooked to perfection and just the right balance of flavors.  Then, we chose the Queen City crepe with a side of mac & cheese.  The chef took the time to split it into two plates for us to share.  Those little attention to details really make the experience more memorable.  Lastly, we had white bean bisque, which was very exquisite.  The flavors balanced well and just really tasted great.  If you come to Charlotte or NODA, I would suggest stopping by to have dinner.  The food and wait staff were amazing.  If you go anywhere else for dinner, you're missing out!  I would say our experience was pretty epic and we will be back soon!",

I had the Ham Gruyere crepe and I have to say, was delicious. My friend had \"The Queen City\" crepe and said it was awesome.

At his suggestion, we grabbed a quick bite here vs. the crowded option across the street.  I was all around pleased with the atmosphere, service and menu options.  Wine and beer available along with daily specials.  The pesto brie fries are a must try.  The only downside was that the noise level, at least at dinner, was not conducive to casual conversation.",

I feel like I'm one of the last people in Charlotte to check out this place and even though it wasn't everything I hoped for, I'm happy I got to try it. I was surprised by how tiny it was with only nine tables in the entire restaurant with a small bar area. Be sure to get there at the right time or be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations.   Ok, so everything on the menu looked good. They had po boys, french baguette pizzas, pastas and more but I couldn't go to the Crepe Cellar without order some yummy, warm crepes so I got the Queen City crepes-roasted chicken, bacon, cheddar topped with oven roasted tomato dressing.   The crepes were good but nothing out of this world. Perhaps I had my heart set on some crepes that would make me want to reenact the deli scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\" but sadly this wasn't the case. They tasted like a hot wrap I could've ordered at an Applebee's or elsewhere and was missing the magic touch. Don't get me wrong, they were good and if it weren't 8pm, I wouldn't had scarfed them down so veraciously as I had. since they were just average tasting. Also, they didn't have that much of a selection of crepes-I think about five or six for the entrees and the same number for dessert crepes.   Service was rockin though along with the bartender-both very helpful and quick to suggest an item so that made up for the meh experience of the crepes. I would expect a place with the name Crepe Cellar to have more of a variety of crepes but I guess that's not what they are going for.",

The service has always been great. The beer selection is pretty good, though the last time I was here ti wasnt as good. I have been when it was really busy and when we were the only ones in there and still get the same great service.   I have had the pesto brie fries a few times and they were really good each time. Some of the best Pesto i have ever had.   The burger is great, not a huge fan of aioli so i get it without, and has tasted fresh and great every time. I have had it with and without bacon and prefer it without bacon. The bacon takes away from the flavor for some reason.   My absolute favorite food here is their Mac and Cheese. Now I am extremely picky when it comes to Mac and Cheese and theirs is amazing. I have had it almost every time and it is always great. I do prefer to eat it hot and not let it cool so much.   I have had the bananna fosters crepe as well and it was good. It was a little different than I expected so I think it caught me off guard but it was good and I would eat it again.

    "text": "I had really high hopes for this place. On a day trip to Charlotte, my sister, my boyfriend, and I stopped by for Sunday brunch. My sister and I had just come back from our trip to Paris, and we were really craving some crepes after having authentic ones from France. The result? Utter disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, the dishes other than the crepes seem to be pretty good. We all ordered the Pesto Brie French Fries to share as an appetizer. Though I thought it to be way too oily (both form the pesto and the double-fry on the potato), the flavor of the pesto mixed with the cheese was really spot on. My sister and boyfriend both ordered non-crepe dishes, and they enjoyed their brunch experience much more than I did. My sister ordered the Kahlua Batter French Toast, and she loved it. The toast itself had a really great amount of moistness without being too soggy. I didn't taste much of the kahlua flavor when I tried the toast, but it was still a pretty good french toast. The side sausage was too spicy and too dry for her taste, but the homefries were really crispy - probably because they are fried - and were quite flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Florentine, and it was tasty as well. The french baguette was crispy, and the egg was perfectly poached. He did say that the smoked salmon underneath the egg cooked a little too much and became too dry. Otherwise, a pretty solid dish.  My experience, on the other hand, was far from ideal. I had the Smoked Salmon Breakfast Crepe, and it just didn't remind me of a crepe at all but more like a breakfast burrito. I clearly asked the waitress to remove the caramelized shallots from my dish, and when I actually dug into my crepe, there were SO MANY shallots. That wasn't my main complaint though. Smoked salmon just shouldn't be cooked in my opinion, and the salmon in my crepe was cooked way too much - became way too dry and lost all the appeal of smoked salmon to begin with. In addition, I thought the eggs in my crepe were really... runny and soggy for some reason, and not in a good way, since they were supposed to be scrambled. The crepe itself had specks of black dots along it (buckwheat maybe?), but it was much too thick and didn't have the flavorful appeal of the better crepes that I've had. I couldn't even finish a fourth of my crepe since it was just too unappetizing. Another huge problem came with the side of grits that I ordered - it was definitely microwaved. There was a layer of film all along the top and the sides of my grits that makes it obvious when something of that consistency is microwaved. Such a disappointment.  This review is purely based on my personal experiences with Crepe Cellar even though I do acknowledge that the other people I came with had much better experiences. I just don't think I can overlook the horribly made crepe and the microwaved grits. If you are to come here, trust me and stay away from the savory crepes.",

They do have much more than crepes to eat so do not worry if you are not a fan of the crepe.

    "text": "Overall, great food and great atmosphere!  The minute I drove by and saw the word crepe, I had been dying to go, so I finally dragged my boyfriend.  I wasn't expecting him to enjoy it since he's more of a \"meat and potatoes\" kind of guy.  He ended up fending well for himself with their tuna seafood special which was to die for.  I on the other hand, stuck with the crepes.  The ham and gruyere crepe was everything I expected and hit the spot.   Just understand that you are getting exactly what you ordered, ham and cheese so don't set your expectations too high.    For being a busy night, we got our food remarkably fast.  The desserts are where it is at when you come here.  We both got the nutella crepes and they were by far our favorite part.  The fruit was fresh and ripe and was a perfect end to a good meal.    My only warning, this place is very small, only 12 or so tables and a small bar, so be aware that if you go during peak hours, you are going to have a pretty good wait.",

I enjoyed sitting at the bar with friends. Had the P.E.I. Mussels with crusty french bread. This evening it was a lemon and rosemary broth. The rosemary was a little overpowering but still tasty. The mussels could have been a bit fresher but still enjoyed the meal. Feels like a Chef driven restaurant with the type of menu selection and changing daily specials. I look forward to going back and trying something new.",

My husband and I go here on occasion and we love it- you really can't go wrong. I love the atmosphere- the \"low lighting\" and the service. We went there last week- and even though it was packed (not unusual) the hostess was extremely tentative and took our name down on a tablet (new, I think- great idea) and sent us a text message when our table was ready. It sits in a great spot in NoDa- so while you wait you can hit up some of the local bars (Growlers, next door). If you go for dinner you MUST try the Nutella Crepe Brownie for dessert....9/10 we have to take it home and it still tastes amazing the next day. Start off with an app. (any are wonderful) and dive into dinner- SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! This place is a must if you live in/near/are visiting Charlotte.",

    "text": "I had heard good things about the Crepe Cellar, so when a friend suggested it as a the location for group Sunday brunch my interests were piqued. Having passed by en route to other NoDa locations, I knew that seating was not particularly plentiful, but I was pleased when my roommate and I arrived first in our group (at 1:15) and were able to score a booth for six.  We ordered a french press of coffee to split (with the acknowledgment that we could always order another later) while we waited for the rest of our party. It was fresh, tasty and the timer they gave us to determine when the coffee was to our particular strength liking was both helpful and adorable, but there was no doubt we would be ordering seconds. I hate to admit it, but as a coffee fiend I would have sacrificed some on quality to add some quantity.  One of our friends used to work at Crepe Cellar, and she ordered a plate of pesto brie fries for the table. I owe here thanks for this because they were delightful, particularly when paired with their tomato ranch which she asked for on the side. I had had a hankering for shrimp and grits all week, so I was pleased to see that they were on the specials board. The grits were creamy but not pasty, the shrimp were plentiful and the gravy was perfectly seasoned and tasted of white wine and hugs. One of our friends ordered the mussels special, which came with a lemongrass & sweet chili sauce and between she and her boyfriend, not a mussel escaped uneaten. Our ex-employee companion got the eggs benedict. The roomie opted for the Sausage & Egg Breakfast Crepe. The flavor from the sausage and red peppers really shone through and the homefries which accompanied were nice and crisp. Where the coffee lacked quantity, the food certainly didn't (particularly the crepes) and I was forced to abandon my last shrimp to the dish pan.  It is hard to comment on the service since the waitress was friends with someone at our table so we were obviously well attended, but I did not get the impression that we would have been left wanting otherwise. The atmosphere was bright and perfectly suited for a Sunday brunch. Prices ran in the 8-13 dollar range for our main dishes, though be warned coffee will run you about 5 bucks.  Overall, Crepe Cellar hit the spot and was a nice change of pace from our normal Sunday pancake routine.",

When we got there it was packed and quite loud, but we got a table right away.  The bar was full as well.  The service was good, almost too attentive, and very upbeat. My wife would say that I am a grouch for saying that.  It did take a while to get to us once we sat down, but it was very crowded, and after that it was quite quick, and the food was very prompt.  They have a very nice selection of beers on tap, and we loved the Chimay and triple strong amber ale that we had.  For food, I had the fish and chips and my wife had a crepe with brie.  The sides were excellent I thought.  I loved the fries and the sauteed spinach that came with my wifes dish, and the purple slaw was good as well.  My wife loved her crepe, but my fish was rather insipid.  it was well cooked, just flavorless.  Maybe a bit too airy in the battering?      Prices were fine. Neither particularly high or low.",

    "text": "Size/ambiance wise, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Weird huh? It just reminds me of my favorite casual neighborhood restaurants/pubs in London, Chicago and San Francisco.   The first time I went with a girlfriend it was a busy stormy night and we sat at the bar for dinner because we couldn't wait for a table. I ordered fish and chips because I had heard they were voted the best in Charlotte, which is kind of like being voted tallest of the Pygmies. Sorry blokes, the fish 'n chips in the Queen City would not make the Queen happy! So I was hopeful, but they disappointed. Unlike Mike K's experience, my fish wasn't soggy or spot on, mine was over fried and quite hard (3/5). I felt it was a bit over battered and then just left in too long. The chips were great tasting but some were quite greasy and soggy. I would love to go back and have both spot on. But I also had the marscapone & berries crepe which was a revelation (5/5). As great as the bananas foster crepe was, I still actually prefer the marscapone/berry crepe!  The second time I went I ordered the spinach & wild mushroom +chicken savory crepe and we shared a bananas foster crepe (4/5). The savory crepe was 3.5/5 good but not the best I've ever had (and they pale in comparison to Cafe Monte's savory crepes).  My husband struggled to find an entree (he doesn't like savory crepes) but was healthy, so he went with a pork special, but be forewarned: DON'T GO IF YOU\"RE ON A DIET! Service on food was great and patient (silly hub was in a picky mood) and bar service is slower.  The last time we went, I got the steak and frites and hubby got the french onion soup and the Crepe Cellar burger complete with onion straws, gruyere and some nice seasoning. Best of all? You can order the burger the temperature you want (in theory) because they grind their own meat in house. I would give the burger 4.5/5 because it came out over done for how he ordered it, but the taste was great without being greasy. He really liked the bun too. French Onion soup was on the sweet side, not too much cheese and was very nice (5/5). My steak was prepared to the right temperature and was a good cut of meat but there was a lot of char on the outside which I had to cut away or accidentally eat and the red wine reduction lacked enough oomph to cover it up. (3/5) Maybe adding a dash of balsamic would have done the trick. Regardless, the frites were more evenly fried and the meal was lovely. Next time I will try mussels or fish special and H will try the baguette pizza.  Bottom Line: Go for the sweet crepes. If they got more variety in the entrees in the \"healthy\" arena, we would be regulars.",

    "text": "Love this place! Now, to start, I am NOT a Crepe aficionado but that does not stop me from loving good food. I went here last night for the first time with a friend. We started off with some wine,which they have a good but small selection as they do the beer list. When we sat down we tried the Cellar Plate which contained 2 different gourmet meats and cheeses with crusty bread. It was OK but a little skimpy for me. On to dinner, I really wanted to try the fish and chips but hesitated due to the bad reviews it's received on Yelp so instead I  opted for  the Sausage and Peppers Crepe and my friend ordered the Spinach/Mushroom Crepe. I was blown away with the amount of food that they served. My Crepe covered the entire plate and my friends' consisted of 2 large Crepes traditionally rolled. I will say that the sides that we ordered were not needed due to the generous portion of our entree. The Sausage was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor. I was not expecting that as most places I find just don't have good sausage. My friend loved her meal as well.   The seating was very limited and very close together which gave it a cozy feel but you can definitely hear everyone elses coversation. I like smaller restaurants like this because they are more representative of the locals. The staff was very friendly too. Great place for a first date or just a romantic date with your favorite person. Needless to say, I will be returning here in the near future. Only this time I will try those Pesto Brie fries that everyone is talking about!",

The short rib tasted as if it had been reheated from a previous day. The gnocchi were so tough that I initially thought they had substituted pan fried potatoes. The kitchen remade them and they were only slightly more tender.   My husband ordered the carbonara and it looked great. But... The pasta was overdone and the dish just seemed pasty and flavorless. It needed salt... Atleast.   Our friend order a scallop dish and his words were.. \"Good concept but not tasty.\"  Overall the kitchen seems to lack balance.

While we didn't really like their signature dish (i.e., their crepes), we liked the other dishes enough to want to return and try something different.   We started with the burrata, a delicious dish of homemade (?) mozzarella, grilled French bread, and a drizzle of honey and lemon.  If you have had the burrata at Dolce, we really think this one is better.  And, it's much less expensive!  For our entrees, I had the four cheese (with bacon) crepe, and my husband had the crepe special, with ham, Swiss, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  His was better than mine, but honestly, neither of us were fond of the grainy buckwheat crepes.  My mac and cheese side, however, was just fantastic.    Service was really good and attentive on a busy Saturday evening.  And we both really liked the vibe of the place.    We will come back, and we'll probably try either a burger or one of their entrees on our next visit.  But we'll most definitely get the burrata again.",

The first time I went there, I got the special crepe with salmon. It was delicious. However, the second time, I ordered the pesto pasta and it was surprisingly disappointing. There was not enough flavor, very bland. I'm not sure if it was an off day or what, but I was sad considering the awesome experience I had the first time.   My friend ordered the beef short rib over potato herb gnocci and that was really good! So I would recommend trying that. The beef was so tender and the gnocci was perfectly cooked with such a great sauce!   The atmosphere is good too. It's quite small, but can be very intimate and private.

Have been here many times but here recently with a friend and I realized I have never reviewed it!!  The sangria here is fantastic.... a summer must.  My favorite item on the menu has to be the Pesto Chicken pizza.  It has sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, tender chicken on a crisp crust.  Perfect to share!  I have had a few of the crepes (Queen City and the Ham & Gruyere) which were good.  I definitely prefered the flavors of the Queen City and who can go wrong with a crepe that has bacon???  I look forward to coming back again and again since it is so close to Uptown.  Overall very consistent food and service!  Love it!  :-D",

I've seen some comments that this is un-NoDa-ish, which is True, but they sell crepes: they need to bring a little class to suit the food. Their decor matches their menu and clashes with their neighbors. What is more NoDa than clashing with the neighbors?  My ham and Gruyere crepe was great, except for the healthy dose of mustard that wasn't described on the menu. I scraped it off, and things were smooth from there.  But my main course was overshadowed by the dessert. The bananas foster crepe was freaking unbelievable. I have never seen so much caramel in one place. So good. But so filling. Next time, I'll skip straight to dessert.",

We started with the cheese and meat platter which was very nice!  3 different additions (fig preserves, strawberry, mustard and crostinis) to the meat and cheese. Next was the flat bread which was actually bread.  I was thinking pizza but nope - more like an open face french bread sandwich - tasty but not exactly what I was expecting.

FYI - Crepe is a french word, so it's typically mispronounced. It's not \"creype\". The first e is pronounced as in \"bed\" - \"Crehpe\".",

The Fusilli pasta was an excellent choice.  It had lots of flavor without being heavy or overpowering.  The dessert (Chocolate Brownie Crepe) was probably THE best thing that hit the table.

    "text": "After an initial bout of extreme disappointment learning the fryers were down when we arrived, we decided to stick around. i had planned on getting Fish and Chips  and/or Pesto Brie French Fries so that was a no go. Instead i went with an actual crepe (my first ever?), it appears to be like the French version of a quesadilla or your standard American wrap. I did enjoy it and would probably recommend it. It was the Queen City with chicken, bacon, cheddar and a tasty sauce. Each bite was flavorful. As my side i ordered the corn and zucchini succotash which they did charge $1 upgrade from the fries that come with it despite the fries not being available. Whatever. And yes, i was called out as i was about to say \"sufferin succotash.\" Come on, how could you not be thinking it.    Sampled the mac n cheese and it just wasn't for me. Maybe it wasn't my kind of cheese but it seemed extremely bland, blah and drab. The steak and Guinness Pie was good. i was just sampling it, but would like for the veggies to be bigger or more plentiful.  The banana fosters was alright, the banana parts were good, but it's just not my favorite type of dessert and actually wouldn't be in my first ten choices for dessert.    The place does have limited seating and while we were eating during their transition to dinner time it appeared one of the tables that sat down was forgotten about as the servers changed. Seems tough to do with the limited number of tables.All the tables were full and i almost felt bad that we had gotten dessert and were finishing the coffee as people stood a few feet away waiting on a table.  Seriously, does every restaurant have to have a tv?",

    "text": "In our ongoing search for the best burger in town, I am happy to report that we have another candidate from a MOST unexpected source!  So the story goes:    A few Sundays ago we were getting ready for the week and musing about how good it would be to have a great burger before the work week started.  I texted a good Friend an asked for something in our neighborhood as I didn't feel like driving across town.  my inquiry for the best burger close to the \"hood\" (we live in Midwood) was to go to the Crepe Cellar in NoDa!  I thought she had misread my text for a moment but she followed up with details before I could ask about how I also needed to have the fries topped with brie and pesto.  A little bit shocked (and wondering how much champagne said friend had intaken that day) we pile din the car and off we went.  Now I have been to the CC for brunch on multiple occasions and found it to be divine... but to think that a crepe joint might have the best burger was still not computing.  We actually found a parking spot out front and were greeted and seated by he pleasant staff in a matter of minutes.  As a brunch patron I never realized that what was on the rest of the menu and I sure didn't have a clue that they had a great beer list!!!  We ordered a really great Scottish IPA (a SIPA? LOL) on draught and the fried brussel sprouts for an app... happily both were amazing!!!  I kept saying I was done with the brussel sprouts and kept going back in for more.  While gorging ourselves on said brussel sprouts we ordered our burgers and when they arrived and we cut them in half you could immediately tell that this place was not playing around!!!  The meat was beautiful and cooked perfectly on the rare side of medium rare.  The fries (as mentioned earlier with the Brie and pesto) also were crazy good... and may be contenders for the best fries in the city as well!!!  All in all we were pleasantly shocked to death and will make the trip back many times in the future to enjoy these crazy good delicacies again!!!",

    "text": "I've been to the Crepe Cellar twice.  My first experience was great.  The second, not so much.  First time, I ordered the oyster po' boy.  Absolutely fantastic!  A generous serving of plump, juicy, tasty oysters, cooked perfectly, along with a great little sauce on a hearty roll.  Very very good.  So . . . I went back again.  But since I just have to try everything at a good restaurant, this time I ordered crepes.  How could I go wrong, right?  Worst crepes I've ever had.  And (at the risk of sounding like a giant snob) I've had them in France--and made them myself--so I know a little something about crepes.  These were very thick--much more akin to a pancake.  A good crepe is so thin you can see through it.  And the flavor was--well, it just wasn't there.  The filling was yummy--spinach and mushrooms and cheese (forget what kind, but there was a little too much of it).  After awhile, I gave up on the crepes and just ate the filling.  Service was great, atmosphere is really nice, but when I go back--and I will--I'll order something other than crepes.",

    "text": "Great spot on Davidson that specializes in crepes.  The savory entree crepes were pretty good, but I have to agree with most everyone else that the desert crepes are a huge draw.  They do not hold back on their use of nutella.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.  It kind of felt like a cellar: very dim, exposed brick, comfortable, slightly cold.  I also liked how casual it felt.  Nice place to enjoy dinner with friends.  The service was good and they have a full bar and nice little wine selection.  For my entree I got a tasty ham and cheese crepe.  it was drizzled with some kind of sauce and had a slight horseradish kick to it.  Nothing out of this world, but filling and fun!  The other crepes sounded delicious and they had a nice special crepe that contained fish.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ended up here at nearly 11:30 pm on a Saturday night. It wasn't crowded but the atmosphere was lively. We had wanted to get a drink and dessert, but when we were told the kitchen closed at 11pm, we hesitated but decided to get a drink anyway. Alex (the bartender) told us to hold on while she double-checked with the kitchen, and when she came back, she told us that the kitchen would make a dessert for us, which was a very nice surprise.   We ordered the Brownie in a Blanket, and WOW. If you're looking for a decadent dessert at the end of a rough day, this dessert will make all your troubles go away. The crepes were perfectly cooked, and the Nutella, brownie and candied walnuts were an exceptional addition to them. They went very well with my perfectly-made Old Fashioned too! All in all, a wonderful first-time visit to Crepe Cellar. I will definitely be back for dinner sometime soon!",

Pesto Brie fries are great - a really unique combination of flavored.  The brussel sprouts are amazing- great texture. The short ribs were fork tender with a delicious sauce and pillow soft gnocchi. BF had fish & chips- flaky and high quality. We split the brownie crepe- so rich and delicious! The absolute best part was the service - Catherine did a great job and was a lot of fun. Their team approach to service ensured efficiency, and every server was just as warm and friendly as Catherine. Can't wait to see the expanded dining area!",

They are insane.  The burgers are great and I always try to split a couple of things so there is room for dessert.  You cannot come here without at least splitting a dessert crepe.  The people that work there are super sweet and try to accommodate however they can for special occasions and big groups.  Its especially awesome for dates or anniversaries and such - and there is a bar right next door (owned by the same people) that you can go afterwards too.",

Everything they make is taste, and clean (in spite of being quite heavy).  Both of these meals are quite reasonably priced, by the way.  If you stick with either of these, you'll be happy.  I've had some not-so-great stuff there as well.   Their truffle brie french fries sounded amazing, but were very disappointing.  Also their dessert crepes were nothing special.  Service is fast.  Staff is polite and professional.  I haven't had a chance to fully explore their menu- it is definitely hit or miss.  The management is great.   On time my fish was a bit undercooked.  I asked them to just heat it up a bit more.   Instead they scrapped the whole thing and brought me a brand new plate- no charge, and offered to throw in a free dessert.   Super nice of them.  And I want to note, that this was the one and ONLY time that anything I ordered from them was less than perfectly prepared.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Situated in Noda (Charlotte's equivalent of Philadelphia's South Street), Crepe Cellar strives to cater to the gastropub gourmand while offering a casual atmosphere and good drinking.   I'll begin by saying that my overall experience (and that of my friends) was very enjoyable. The staff was friendly, the selection of alcohol was diverse and the food had its highs and lows.   I applaud this restaurant's efforts in offering gourmet dishes in a pub scene. It is rare to see many pubs around here moving away from the stereotypical american bar. Example: Beef Short Rib over Potato Herb Gnocchi with roasted tomatoes, shallots, and cabernet reduction. Sounds delicious, and it was! But there are other items that attempt to push the envelope and miss completely. The pan seared duck breast not only had a \"gamey\" taste, but the \"Korean BBQ Sauce\" that was drizzled over it had no resemblance to anything from that country (neither the North nor the South). In fact, the taste was so familiar to me that I pinpointed it directly to the sweet chili sauce that you dip your Chinese take-out spring rolls in. And for the $22 this place is demanding for such a dish, I was sorely disappointed. As for the steak and frites, the meat was cooked nice and pink and the red wine sauce had a deep and velvety richness to it. The fries are good for mopping up the leftover sauce.  I think if you're making a trip all the way out here though, you should just stick to the crepes because the dessert that followed was perfection. We decided to split three different crepes to experience a variety of flavors and the choice was well made. We chose the mascarpone with berries, the crepe suzette (grand marnier, delicious), and the banana nutella. Everyone knows that the filling is a big deal, but it becomes irrelevant if the the crepe that holds it is structurally unsound, overly doughy, or rough and grainy. Crepe Cellar lives up to its name. The crepes were perfect. They were smooth, light, golden, and salted just enough to bring out the flavors they were showcasing. Of all the three, the Crepe Suzette was by far the best. It had a little \"pool\" of Grand Marnier underneath, which I imagine was flambeed, and a small ball of vanilla ice cream was placed on top. The combination was a deliciously sweet, creamy, alcoholy flavor that one could probably keep eating non-stop.   I would definitely come back here to try the savory crepes and I would encourage others to do the same. Don't expect an intimate date though, it can get quite loud in the evening!  4/5",

I've visited Crepe Cellar quite a few times, and my last 2 experiences have pretty much shown me that they don't appreciate your business and couldn't care less about the service they give customers. Most recently, I went there on a Sunday, early afternoon, for brunch. We were seated quickly, but after waiting 10 min, and seeing several servers ignore us, and not even come take our drink orders, I had had enough. I watched a server speak to a table of guys right behind me, who were already done with their meal, and she didn't even look in my direction. Sadly enough, this server was the same person who seated me! Ridiculous. I brought it to their attention as I walked out the door, and the response I got was nonchalant & very unapologetic. Nevertheless, it was my last time there.",

I ordered a simple soup of the day (mushroom & leek) and it was oh so tasty.  I ended up eating my friends' pesto brie fries and I can see why it's a feature item.  It was like a combustion of so many flavors.  I also got a slice of their pizza/flatbread.  I didn't expect it to come on such a thick looking piece of bread, but it was moist yet crunchy on the outside.  All in all the food was 2-thumbs up... only thing is there's some serious garlic in all the items we ate, thank goodness I was the 3rd wheel and kissing wasn't on my agenda.

    "text": "The first best thing about Crepe Cellar Kitchen & Pub is that their primary food offering comes in some form of crepe, which is the best food delivery vessel in existence. Sweet or savory, they are a thing of taste bud glory, especially when they are done well.  The second best thing about Crepe Cellar is that the service and food quality is consistently excellent, whether for a large group of boozy women, an intimate dinner date, or with the family for Mother's Day Brunch, in the middle of which your baby may or may not have spit up on the floor. Perhaps it was an opinion on the oddity of judgment that Mac & Cheese is no longer served at Sunday Brunch. Special thanks to the staff who was completely gracious and sanitary about assisting in clean up. But, for real, why no Mac & Cheese at Sunday Brunch like back in the day?  Crepe Cellar is gauzily lit and cozy, just as a crepe eatery should be. However, since it is on the small side and they don't take reservations, it is best to get there early, or expect to belly up their comely bar.  Once seated at a table or the bar, The Queen City Crepe is a savory standout, and the Bananas Foster and Nutella & Bananas (don't forget the strawberries!) dessert crepes are plain old joy in a bowl.  If crepes aren't your speed*, their burgers were a close second in The Charlotte Observer's 2011 \"New School Best Burger\" contest, and paired with the Pesto Brie Fries, the meal is a sure winner. Regardless of what is chosen, it will be as delicious as the eclectic people stew that is increasingly stirring in NoDa, where the Crepe Cellar can be found at 3116 North Davidson Street in Charlotte.  *Crazy talk.",

    "text": "This place was surprisingly good so that may be why I am giving it 4 stars.  I think my expectations were pretty low so I came out on top in this case!  It was one of the only places not taking reservations for NYE so we ended up eating here with a group of 6.  They had a seared tuna over sweet potatoes special that night and a sausage and peppers crepe.  Everyone in our party was very satisfied with their meals.  At our table we ordered a couple of the tuna meals, the sausage and peppers crepe, the queen city crepe, the pasta dish and I ordered the endive and apple salad....I know, seems to be a little boring but this was one of the best I have ever had.  I think it was their ginger maple dressing..a must try!!!    Everything had a lot of flavor and seemed pretty fresh.  Those who had fries on the side were especially happy because they were seasoned curly fries.  Very scrumptious!  Then came the dessert....I was hoping that we could all try something different but the waitress steared us all to the brownie in a blanket.  It was exactly what it sounds like...a big warm brownie wrapped up in a crepe, topped with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and candied walnuts.  It was a very rich brownie and it was also covered with nutella so it was super filling.  We really could have ordered one with 6 people and we would have been fine.  The vanilla bean ice cream was a little...well...bland.  It had  potential to really join forces with the brownie and make a perfect bite, but for some reason it just didn't flow that well in my opinion.  It didn't add anything to the overall flavor as I was hoping it would.  And, quite honestly, the crepe didn't add much to the whole package either.  It was just not quite working for me.  I think you have to be still semi-hungry and an absolute chocolate lover to enjoy this dessert.  It was good but it could have been a little better in my opinion!  I am dying to try the bananas foster crepe.  I will definitely return.  The negatives:  Not very many vegetarian or vegan options. The scene:  Great for groups, not a romantic setting even thought it is dim in the restaurant. Location:  It is centrally located in the fun noda area so it is a great place to grab a quick, affordable fun dinner AND dessert before heading to your next spot!  Definitely worth checking out!",

    "text": "First time in NODA in years and years. Was anxious to see the development and new stuff going on up there.   The Crepe Cellar is not new; it has been around for about ten years. I don't think I had eaten there before, so Janet, my cousin-in-law,  and I decided to travel some distance to check it out. The place was fabulous.  Outstanding food. Outstanding ambiance. Outstanding service. Everything was in perfect order and I loved it, until the bill arrived. We both had the Crepe du Jour, which had chicken and beans and other fresh ingredients that made our taste buds dance.  The price of this special was not on the blackboard, so I assumed it was in line with the other prices on the menu.  Turns out, each crepe was $16.  Now, let me remind you, this was NOT a fresh catch of the day.  This was a C R E P E.  I don't blame them for not putting the price on the board!   I had a side of Brussel sprouts and misunderstood that a side was NOT included with the meal. The Brussel Sprouts, however, were amazing and worth the miles to get to this restaurant.  And the iced tea, which was the best I've had in ages, was fresh and so tasty, but $3.00 a glass was simply too much. I probably wouldn't gripe about $2.00 a glass.  In conclusion, a $50 lunch was NOT what I had in mind for the two of us.  Clearly, it was overpriced, even if the food was terrific.  Even if the atmosphere was terrific.   Oh, it turns out the owner has four restaurants right there together in NODA.   Obviously he has a great thing going and with his special crepes going for $16, he must be amongst the very rich and famous in the Queen City.   Go check out this restaurant, but take your fat wallet with you!",

My wife had the burger which had great flavor. Fries were great also. We also had a crepe which was phenomenal. I had the club sandwich which was fine, but that's what I get for ordering a club at a creperie. Brussel sprouts are a must try and the slaw is among the best I've had.",

You were worth it.  Your perfectly seasoned hand cut home fries make my mouth water. Your cooked to perfection hand carved corned beef make my eyes shine with tears of joy. And your caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers?! Love, I have found True love in the Queen City.  But you wish for the chase. Only appearing once a month. That is okay, I can be patient.

A fresh made crepe with walnuts and stuffed with a delicious moist brownie topped with ice cream.

It was made fresh there. It came with toasted French Bread. ( it was done over the fire) Even the Bread had so much Flavor. It was so good you could eat that by itself. This dish came with Honey and Lemon. Incredible. The Flavors of Honey Lemon and the cheese was month watering. And this was just the start of a Great meal. I also had the Fried Chicken Cordon Bleu. You would think OK Fried Chicken. That is always Good. No this was beyond good It was Great. Again the Flavors they used was do delightful. I could not even explain. You just had to try it. ( it was served on some type of French Bread) This has been One of the Best meals we have had since we moved here two years ago. If you are looking for one Fantastic Meal you must come here. I could eating here ever night. The Cooks are True Artists.    A Note to the Owner( I think his name is Jeff)  All I have to say to you.... Is please keep doing what you are doing because everything was so Perfect. I 100% will be coming back as soon as I can. And ask for Arthur as a waiter. You will not go wrong.

    "text": "so this seems to be a popular place in charlotte, but i was a bit underwhelmed by my whole experience here.  first off, we were the only ones in the restaurant on a weekday night. no one else showed up for a half hour, and it seemed that the waitress had better things to do than check up on us in a more timely manner. she wasn't mean or rude, but she almost seemed uninterested in serving us by how she approached and left our table. maybe i was reading too much into it, but i found it odd. perhaps, she was just trying to give us our space and not \"smother\" us. i don't know. she really could have talked up the menu or been more into asking us what we needed/wanted.  my husband and i shared the house salad, the fish and chips and the infamous bananas foster crepe for dessert. house salad tasted good, but the dressing was overpoweringly garlicky. i could only eat half of it, because it was so strong. normally, i would have eaten it all myself--because, c'mon. it's just salad. the fish was actually perfect. nice crispy breading with a tender, moist fish in the middle. not too much batter, and no fish taste. just fresh and delicious. the tartar sauce was good, but not amazing. and the fries were a little too salty. they were cooked well. just too much sodium chloride.  and then--AND THEN--the bananas foster crepe. everyone here has raved about this crepe, so i decided we should try it. umm...maybe we went to the restaurant when everyone that worked there was having an off-day, but i thought it was totally boring. i was expecting something amazing, and i couldn't have been more sleepy about it. i've had better crepes at a friend's house, who had only learned to make crepes the same day we went over. it wasn't gross or anything. i guess there was just so much hype for me that i thought there would be more to it.   sorry crepe cellar. while i'm glad i went to experience it, i don't know that i will go back. first impressions sort of mean a lot to me. and, i don't want to fall asleep at the table.",

The onion soup had very little flavor, just a sprinkle of cheese, and tasted gelatin like. Half the mussels were closed on the plate and in general it seemed like the chef was doing a lot of shopping at Costcos. I've become acustomed to better from this place. hope to see some change for the better again!",

Because we had tickets to an event, my friend attempted to make reservations and was told that reservations were not accepted, but if we arrived by 6:00, there should be no problem with seating.  Were we ever wrong!  The place was packed, and I guess I should be glad for the restaurant.  We thought about going some place less crowded, but we were told we would be seated in 15 minutes.  Now.  I don't care if you are the owner, busboy, hostess.....whatever.  Don't say \"15 minutes\" if you can't deliver.  We waited close to an hour before we had a table.  I ordered the spinach and mushroom crepe.  I have enjoyed this entree in the past.....creamy, delicious and vegetarian.  As I was eating, I bit down into something absolutely repulsive and discovered it was chicken.  Because we were pressed for time, I simply removed the poultry from the dish.  What was left was a smidge of spinach and very few mushrooms, no cheese or sauce to speak of.  Thank goodness for the smattering of fries, or I would have left hungry.  I am typically laid back, but this experience was definitely a gastronomic horror film.",

SO MUCH FLAVOR.  the spiciness of the blackened chicken and the ancho chile aioli was somewhat undercut by the creaminess of the blue cheese.  There's also melted cheddar but you would never know, as it gets swallowed up by the strong flavors of everything else.

    "text": "This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I've been a couple times and find myself craving Crepe Cellar daily.   The atmosphere and the people are great!  Like Ashley V. said, it is a small restaurant so on any night of the week you could find yourself waiting a while for a table.  But it is SO worth it!   The Food:    I had the daily seafood special.  It was a seared tuna steak crusted with some delicious seasonings that I can't recall (cumin could have been one).  It was cooked to perfection!  Nice and crunchy on the outside and red on the inside but still warm.  It flaked apart perfectly!  No knife needed.  And it was a big portion of tuna too - nothing wimpy.  The tuna was sitting on a bed of delicious flavorful risotto.  The plate was topped with 3 asparagus spears and surrounded with ponzu sauce that was soooo good!  For dessert, it was hard to make a decision between the strawberry/nutella crepe and the banana fosters crepe.  I went banana fosters.. The crepe was filled with the delicious rum butter sauce and covered with more of the sauce and cooked bananas.  There was a pretty good sized amount of whipped cream off to the side too.  It was warm, melty and buttery -- I loved every bite of it.   My bill came out to be $34.00 but that included 2-$4 beers. Crepe = $7 (one of the more expensive ones)  They range in price from $4-8 depending on add ons like ice cream and extra fruit. The special was $17 by far the most expensive thing there.  Regular menu items are about $7-10.    Overall:  What are you doing still reading this?  You should be at Crepe Cellar right now!  Unless it's Monday - that's the one day they are closed.",

Then for the main meal my girlfriend and I split one of the flat bread pizzas and I promise you it was more than enough for the two of us.

Besides prices, the food and presentation was great. The fries are awesome.....what else. OH! duh, like the name, when you walk in, it looks like you're inside of a cellar!

I have been there several times because I value the creations of the chefs and cooks at this place as a culinary enthusiast that I am and a lover of 'real' food. I was always willing to try the chef's specials-which are obviously not on the menu, but often written on a mirror on the back wall or your waiter/waitress will tell you what they are -and was never disappointed.  For example, a couple of things I tried from the specials were:    Poblano Pepper Bisque Carrot Ginger Bisque Fig Crepe with Vanilla Ice Cream Sea bass with Risotto and Rosted vegetables Salmon Crepe with Spinach and Rosted tomato   If it's your first time I would go for one of their popular items:   Queen City Crepe Salads! - if you are in for something lighter, their salads are great too!  Pesto fries, especially if you're sharing them Mascarpone and Berries Crepe - if you are in the mood for something fresh Bananas Foster Crepe - if you want something warm and sweet on a cold day Brownie in a Blanket Crepe - if you just don't care lol  They also have a good selection of wine and cheese in case you are in for something small and just want a good place for a nice date.  Another, place I can't wait to go back to.   Do yourself a favor, be adventurous and try the daily specials!",

We also shared a brownie in the basket for dessert. It was literally a chunk of brownie wrapped in a crepe topped with Nutella, candied walnuts, whipped cream and a huuuge scope of vanilla ice cream.

I had n awesome chicken Crepe with a side of Mac and cheese. The creamiest Mac and cheese ever, it was delish!!  I'd go back for sure and next time try dessert.   Only one drawback and that was parking, but not anything that would stop me from returning.",

    "text": "Normally we never go out to the NODA area and I never ever though we would eat here because when you hear a name like the Crepe Cellar all you think you are going to be eating are crepes. well weren't we wrong. Yes, of course they have crepes. But they also are known for many other things. For example their CREPE CELLAR BURGER (which I will be getting next time.   When we walked in, it was a dark little restaurant that really reminded me of a pub feel. We were sat immediately and had the best server, Alex. She was so lively and excited that it was our first time in to eat. It really made the experience more exciting for us. She was very knowledgeable and seemed to really enjoy working there.   So... For an appetizer, we ordered the mussels, which was very surprising to me because normally we never order mussels. Actually, now that I think about it, I have never seen my man eat mussels. But we ordered them and it was so worth the risk because they were AMAZING! The mussels were cooked with bacon, caramelized onions, shallots, apples, and cider cream. To me, I was like no this can't be a good combination... but again I was wrong! It was a perfect combination of sweet, tart, light, creamy, deliciousness. If you are to go and get them ask them for extra bread to dip in once you finish. Great sharing dish.  For our entrees, my man had the BEEF SHORT RIB OVER POTATO HERB GNOCCHI, which included roasted tomatoes, shallots, cabernet reduction along with the gnocchi and beef short rib. The Short rib was so tender. I had their PASTA CARBONARA, which was fresh pasta, egg yolk, pancetta, grilled asparagus, parmesan, and black pepper. I ate it as is and it was actually a very light dish. You can add chicken or salmon for some extra protein. Entrees were portioned perfectly, but I suggest getting an appetizer or dessert if you are very hungry.  We were so full that we couldn't get a crepe for dessert, so we have to do that next time. It is definitely worth the trip out to Noda for this place.",

    "text": "I have been putting off writing this for a long time. Largely because it is my most visited and most familiar 'special occasion' restaurant. I think it's a lot easier to write about one given experience, but to aggregate dozens of different visits into one straightforward review is a little bit more challenging! Let's give it a go.  First of all, when you walk in you're immersed in a very intimate atmosphere that maybe you weren't expecting in the NoDa neighborhood. This spot is great for friends catching up with each other or date night with your significant other. Seating at the bar is first come first served, while the wait times for dining room seating has improved with recent renovations/expansion to the rear of the restaurant.  I highly suggest the seasonal cocktails they feature on the constantly rotating menu, their bar staff is top notch and they even age their own Burbon!  For starters, if it's your first time here, no question you've got to try the award winning (Charlotte Magazine) pesto brie fries. The pesto that's served with it adds such a bold flavor that contrasts well with the mellow creaminess of the brie, it's a True delight.  Make sure to check out the specials. They do a weekly special crepe, seafood dish, Mussel, soup, and veg, which they list on a board near the back of the restaurant, but your server should go over them as well. Barring any showstoppers on the special menu, I always know what I'm in the mood for: Slow roasted short rib, served with a cabernet reduction, with heirloom tomatoes and roasted shallots. If you think I copied and pasted that from the menu you'd be wrong, I've ordered this so many times it's burned in my brain! Every bite is pure perfection, I'm serious, I could just die right there with no regrets after finishing a plate of this.  You may be wondering where the crepes are in this review. To be honest, I love the entree crepe dishes, but I like to save the crepe for dessert. They make an outstanding crepe suzette with a creamy sauce finished with grand mariner and topped with the most amazing ice cream. I'll say no more, words cannot do this dish any justice.  At the end of the night, before you leave, pause a minute to just savor the atmosphere. Friends and family enjoying each others company, the passers-by reveling in a fun night in NoDa, and the hustle of the amazing kitchen churning out stellar food all blend together like a symphony. It's a curious experience for me every time, and I can't wait to come back.",

The exposed brick walls, large bar, and smaller, low-lit eating space gives the Crepe Cellar a very intimate feel.   I tried the ham and gruyere crepe with a side of asparagus. The crepe was delightfully crispy and light and packed full of flavor with the cheese and meat. My asparagus was also worth the slight up-charge, especially due to the sundried tomato topping that capped off the side. Highly recommend.",

My brother lives down the street from this beautiful lil spot and knows I'm terrible to take out. This menu was AMBITIOUS and I had to try it. I was not let down. It seemed like every detail was carefully chosen, each flavor profile meticulously worked out. You can't just put a lavender lime linguini on a menu and walk away. It was extremely well balanced even if the plating were a bit off (Sorry, i can't stop thinking about it! Bigger dish! Higher! Ppl get price tag sensitive otherwise) Burrata was lovely, short rib gnocchi melted properly, and house salad wasn't an afterthought, it started my meal right. Staff was all super cute and attentive without being overpowering, kitchen was clean and I was HAPPY. Thanks, y'all!",

I also had the Queen City crepe with arugula salad topping and nice creamy tomato dressing. Excellent buckwheat crepe and quite filling and satisfying with turkey, bacon, and cheddar. Great drink options. Love the idea its a pub and restaurant with unique food menu! We'll be back for sure.",

The atmosphere is perfect for a date night since it has a really romantic vibe.   The crepes themselves are amazing! When I when here I had a dessert crepe with nutella in it! The crepe itself was warm and the nutella was oozing out of it. The entire thing was topped with whipped cream adding the finishing touch. If you are looking for something  more on the savory side they have different options to include ham, wild mushroom and spinach, plus more.   If you are in the NoDa area I would give this place a try.",

    "text": "When I won a raffle at a Charlotte Checkers game earlier this season, one of the two prizes was a gift card for Crepe Cellar.  We used it for our early Valentine's Day dinner and we really enjoyed it.  We were also hungry after walking from the near Midtown to Freedom Park and back.    We arrived in Noda at 5:30 or so.  Like all \"this is a cool and older neighborhood\", parking can be difficult.  We found a spot in the tiny lot behind the restaurant.    Upon entering we found a small table for two in the small place.  The place only has a few tables and small bar, but it is somewhat efficient.  I saw they had Heineken on tap (a rarity) and for only $4, I gladly obliged.  My wife had the house red wine which she said was good.  Our waitress, Alex, was very nice.  We started with a cheese plate.  Yummy Maytag, aged cheddar, sliced beef and prosciutto hat actually didn't taste salty.  There was some crostini, strawberries, and candied walnuts too.  The cheese plate could have been a small meal for one person we ordered more.  I had spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese crepe which was very tasty and large.  It was served with fries which were phenomenal.  They were the perfect size, flavor, texture, and crispiness and would have went great with malt vinegar.  My wife had a small salad, cheese grits, and about 1/4 of my crepe.  By this time were stuffed so we did not get dessert ( a few people were also waiting so we wanted to be polite and let them sit down and eat). However I noticed that several desserts are served with Nutella which to me is not good.  There are few things of which I don't like the flavor but hazelnut is one of them.    All in all, our experience at Crepe Cellar was very good from the food to the service to the drinks to the atmosphere.  I am glad I won that gift card otherwise I may never have tried it.  The prices are also very reasonable with the crepes being $8-9 but you can also get more price items like steak or shrimp and grits.",

The dessert crepes are also fantastic, sweet and tummy but not so rich that you're left with a toothache after :-)  The service is always friendly and the food gets out to you rather quickly. I've only gone right after work, around 5:30pm, so I usually beat the real dinner rush around 6:30/7:00.",

I will speak fondly of this place towards all those who can hear the sound of my voice and to those who read my words. Heed them. Heed these words or warning. EAT HERE!!! or you will die without fully experiencing this world to it's fullest. Your soul will forever be trapped in purgatory until you are able to figure out where you went wrong, re-enter a new body, and try again in this world. Even for those of you whom I don't speak to aloud, I will try my damndest to psychically emit thoughts to their brain about how delicious this place is from a subconscious level, even while asleep.  I tried the blackbean and carrot burger and it was... delicious. I received pink coleslaw with it and although I had to look around to make sure I wasn't having (yet another) random psychedelic response for no reason, I found that, to my delight, the coleslaw really is pink. And delicious. It didn't have that overwhelming mayo or sweet onion taste to it. It tasted...uh... delicious. The beer, I think it was Bell's Amber or something like that, was also delicious and because they were having tap problems and delayed getting me a glass, they gave it to me for free. My dad had a steak and my girlfriend had a crepe and it was DELICIOUS according to them. My love love also had a beer, Dogfish Nameste and she's a fan of it.  Also, I like the environment. The lighting in combination with the wallpaper and glasswear, to me, gave it a comfortable, relaxing, and even romantic atmosphere. The staff was also very nice. The waitress even genuinely laughed at my dad's corny jokes. I hope she didn't kill herself afterwards. I'm sure she's fine though.",

The crepe was yummy - filling but not overly so.  It was a nice break from the usual salads and sandwiches that I eat for lunch.  Anyway, there are 2 reasons this place gets the extra star that says I'm a fan - service and soundtrack.  The people were really friendly, gave good suggestions, and very patient with us.  As for the soundtrack, I don't remember the individual songs, but I remember them all being ones that I love and that fall into that category of upbeat in a relaxing way.  All in all, definitely a great lunch spot.",

Delicious!! We split one for desert (yup, it's that big) and had it with coffee. Note - if you order a cup of coffee you will get an entire French press (I.e., 3-4 glasses of coffee).

    "text": "Ok I am disappointed, tonight was not a very nice experience at Crepe Cellar. I've had better experiences. The waitress was indifferent, I asked her for recommendation but she acted like she was ready to leave. We didn't even go that late, it was 8:30PM. My Sangria was TERRIBLE, i want my $7 back! The Banana and nutella crepe was too sweet, this is the second time I had it and it is still not right. If you are going to call yourself crepe cellar, at least make your crepes takes good. If you want GREAT crepes, Try Hazelnut creperie, you won't be disappointed! The flavors are much more on par and the chefs are more committed. That being said, I do like the atmosphere at Crepe cellar, dark lighting, busy crowd and it is very loungey feel. I think they serve better salted food, like pesto fries and such. Just don't get anything sweet here, whenever I get sweets here, it ends up disappointing. My Crepe was OK, like acceptable, but my drink was TERRIBLE. Oh well, still a nice little place in Noda.",

After that,  I was told by the bartender that I would receive a water while I browsed the wine list. 12 minutes later, a couple beside of me received waters before I did, while the bartender was their making their cocktails. After several minutes of waiting, with only a menu and no drink or water.  I hope that this was just a really off night, because I'm sure that's not normal.",

Hoping our very attentive server conveyed my message to the chef and they add it to the menu, cuz, ya know, I have that kind of pull in these here parts! Excellent beer selections. Diverse menu.

The hostesses(2) ignored us completely and yelled at the other couple that walked passed them to enter the restaurant. They really didn't understand their job description but I was already in love with this place so we didn't let that bother us and found the last 2 seats at the bar. Perfect!   The bartender was awesome. Personable,knowlegable,everything you would want in a bartender. Ambiance is romantic,classy but loud. (Very small dining area with nothing to soak up the acoustics=loud. )   Not sure if the a/c was working but it felt about 80 degrees in there.   We ordered the bananas fosters crepe with ice cream and 2 drinks.  The sauce,fresh whipped cream,bananas,ice cream were all amazing except the crepe! The crepe was too thick,tasteless and chewy. Such a shame since the NAME of the place is CREPE cellar! Not sure if its the recipe or the cook but they gotta fix that. Overall we had a very nice experience.",

My party and I started with the pesto fries, which I'm less sure were \"pesto\" proper than the ingredients of pesto infused into the fries. A delicious, greasy snack. We also had the brussel sprouts which were fantastic. Less great was the shrimp something in a cup and a loaf of baked bread. Wasn't quite sure what was supposed to go on there. Shrimp something on the bread? It was okay, just unclear what I was eating (and probably partly my fault as I didn't order it!)  With my meal, which was the burger, which was fine and straight down the middle of the plate, I had a Scottish IPA, which was very good.  Overall, the service here was kind, friendly, and good. Not \"hipster\" service at all (which would be aloof and too cool and annoyed that I have to even work here at all to supplement the support of my self-indulgent hobbies-ZING!).",

Their pesto brie fries are awesome and the brussels sprouts are the best I've had anywhere. The sprouts are roasted and then topped with arugula pesto and parmesan--yum yum! My husband and I split the fries and sprouts as our meal and still had leftovers.  They usually have specials that sound delicious.

After putting our name down on the electronic waitlist, we were accidentally notified our table was ready. But we waited patiently outside until another table was available.

    "text": "Great balls of fire! Found a new brunch spot. Yaye. They won me over from the time we walked in,from the host that greeted us at the door, to our waitress, and the fact that its in the noda art district. The young lady that was our waitress was more than nice and explained alot of the dishes on the menu even went on to tell us that their burger won the best burger and fries i want to say last year.  Our food  by no means we had no complaints! My friend ordered the award winning burger that she could not stop boasting about how good it was, and i ordered the chicken crepe and fries. When i say my food was so good it made you want to jump up and slap your mama! Some special sauce that i can not explain its taste drizzled on top of my crepe was so mouth drooling good. Please don't get me started on the chicken inside of the crepe, that was oh so juicy, tender, and tasty. My stomach is growling as i sit here speaking on all of this goodness we had here at Crepe Cellar.  Decor you ask? The vibe in here was real chill. The only part i hate that being that it was such a nice day i would have not minded if we sat on a patio but they don't have a patio here.Wooden unique wine case behind the booths was a nice touch with wine bottles set up for display and may have been for sale who knows. For everyone that hangs out in noda, rather you live here or you don't you most definitely want to come grab a meal here. Matter fact i think im going back this weekend.",

    "text": "We have eaten here several times and always had a great experience. We typically stick with the same items - I like the burger with a side of brussel sprouts. My husband usually does the fish and chips or a hearty crepe. We've had the French onion soup and enjoyed it. A friend of ours loves the duck and the roasted chicken. My absolute favorite thing here is the brussel sprouts! They are so delicious and each bite is amazing. Their fries here are good but I always sub them out for the brussel sprouts because they are that dang good.   Every employee we've ever interacted with has been kind and helpful. The decor inside is cozy and beautiful. I appreciate the unisex bathroom for both its inclusivity and the fact that it helps eliminate lines for the bathroom at peak hours.   Overall, a solid spot that we enjoy!   Note: no pics because on our most recent trip here, we were so engulfed in our conversation and enjoying the company of those at our table. Carpe diem!",

It is an incredible looking and tasting burger with Gruyere cheese, crispy onion straws and a garlic aioli sauce on soft potato bun.   We also tried a Pesto Pasta w/ Chicken which was very good! My only problem is when I order a pasta dish I ALWAYS expect bread with the dish. I requested some bread and they brought me a little baguette which they charged me 3.50 for!    FYI Anytime you serve a pasta dish, bread should automatically be included!    Otherwise, the service was good the place is nice and clean. Their prices are on the high side, but the food is good, so it's not bad.   Just a note regarding parking.....IT SUCKS!",

Some of the worst most over priced pretentious food I've ever had in Charlotte. What is wrong with this place??  One of their specials absolutely repulsed my out-of-town guests, they could barely look at me while I was eating. They smothered the pasta in \"squid ink\" (black) which I'm pretty positive was food dye! My teeth, lips, tongue were 100% black!! Absolutely disgusting!   Then we try to order a dirty martini as a night cap, wash off my black teeth. Shows up 20 minutes later in a half empty restaurant, halfway full, and 99% pickle juice and water. Had to send it back, wasn't even drinkable.   Point being, I won't be back and neither should you. Go to Cabo Fish or Haberdish- better prices, service and food.",

My wife's entree had corned beef and she absolutely loved it (and this was the first time she ever tried sunny side up eggs).  Hands down this place was great.

We ordered extra bread to sop it up with, the flavor was perfect. We each ordered a savory crepe and really enjoyed them...along with parmesan fries!   Great drink selection as always and the service was attentive and friendly. In general, I have been incredibly impressed with the customer service provided by the front of house staff as well as management, I'm happy to give my business to a restaurant that seems to truly appreciate customers.",

    "text": "My friend and I were walking around NoDa around lunchtime and didn't really know what we were hungry for. After looking at Crepe Cellar's menu, we popped in and took a seat at the bar.   There's an endless crepe opportunity. Buckwheat, vegan, veg-friendly, dessert - I mean, whatever you're looking for, you will find. That's why we knew this was the place for us.  Ordered some whiskey- checked out the menu further and we settled on TWO non-crepe options. I'll let that sink in...we came here for the crepe diversity and neither of us ordered crepes. Le sigh.    Here's what we wound up with.   Black Bean & Carrot Veggie Burger - NOM! Most veggie burgers, in my experience, fall apart. They are created and are really moist - which isn't a bad thing- but sometimes this calls for them to fall apart and you spend most of your time piling it on a fork. I'd come back just for this burger. It was a masterpiece of delightful flavors.   Fish & Chips- battered and fried, served with fries and purple slaw - this is an English/Irish style fish & chips combo. You're going to end up with some heavy duty fish and it's not overly fried or greasy. The purple slaw was my favorite part of this meal, not only does it give it a pop of color it offers a bit of texture.   Needless to say I will return becuase I need to order crepes and expereince those.",

Anyway, coming here is a process, but a good and easy one. First, you are greeted by a friendly host or hostess. Then they take you to your table, my favorite server, Grace typically serves us and takes very good care of us. If you don't know what to drink (even if you don't drink alcohol like me), never fear! Dustin is here! He will make you something that's guaranteed to make your tastebuds smile! I like his orange cream drink and the crepe cellar refresher personally. At a near perfect time, your food will come out piping hot and fresh. I like the lavender like linguini and the short rib gnocchi. Both are to absolutely die for! Meanwhile, Grace will consistently check on you to make sure everything  is ok, which it is every time! Then, you get to finish the night off with one of many artisan crepes. I personally like the crepe Suzette the best, but all of them are out of this world. anyway, thank you for bringing flavor and personality to the table and eliminating food service crap restaurants (like that nasty restaurant landmark) from my palette!",

    "text": "Pretty much the bread and butter date night or sweet tooth du jour of NoDa. You really can't go wrong at Crepe Cellar.   The crepes are made with buckwheat, so you may be in for a bit of a surprise at first bite. A a little more chewy, earthy, and malty than your mom's crepes. Definitely better for the savory variety.   One of the strengths of Crepe Cellar is their offering of savory and sweet crepes. You definitely need to try the Queen City savory. Wonderful flavors. Can't believe how much it made me love chicken, mushrooms and spinach together. Who knew all it took was a buckwheat crepe? The oven-roasted tomato dressing goes good on ANYTHING. Definitely the center stage act of this dish.   When it comes to sweet, just try anything. You won't be unhappy. Especially with a piping hot brownie, ice cream and accompanying a warm, fresh crepe. Come on, America. France is right on this one.   Lastly, alcohol. I love that they have so many good beers. Both both bottle and draught. Lots to choose from. Or, if you're a redneck like me, PBR is pretty cheap here. Hell yes. If you're of the classier alcohol mantra, definitely go for the Cellar Cider. Wonderful little concoction. Baron Jager and a few other spirits. Definitely worth the dough.   Limited seating here, folks. Make sure you get here at a decent hour or put your name in and walk the streets of NoDa. Typically an hour wait or so on busy nights.   You'll be pleased with your visit. Bar none. One of the staples in the Queen City.",

We expected it to be busy (as we've seen people lined up on the street before), but the waittime wasn't bad.  The hostess took our name and phone number down on an iPad so they could text us when our table was ready.  I loved that!  So much better than the old restaurant pager.  This allowed us to go \"out of range\" and walk around NoDa while we waited.    We got back just in time for a text letting us know that our table was ready.  Perfect timing!  We were seated in a huge booth by the window.  I felt a little guilty because we were taking up so much space but I really loved being seated there with a view instead of at one of the tables that are closer together.  I expected the menu to be full of crepes, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the menu was pretty extensive and offered a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees besides crepes.  I had a tough time deciding what to get because three or four things were jumping out at me.    We did start with the Pesto Brie Fries, though, as an appetizer.  Not only was the topping delicious and unique, but the fries themselves were, too.  They could have used a lot more Brie, though, for my tastes.   I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blue sandwich and my partner ordered the Black and Blue Po Boy (blackened chicken and blue cheese).  It wasn't really a True \"po boy\" sandwich, though, but no worries.  Both sandwiches were good, but after taking a bite of each other's, I suddenly fell in love with the Black and Blue and he really liked the Cordon Blue better because it was less spicy.  So...we swapped and both had a delicious meal.  Because we already had the french fries app, he opted for the alternative purple coleslaw as a side, and I substituted for a good-sized side salad for only $1 more.    We were pretty full after all of that, but we felt that we had to order a crepe for dessert, having skipped over the dinner crepes.   Obviously they must be good; they named the restaurant after them!  We went with the Bananas Foster Crepe.  Good choice.  The sauce that came over top the crepe was divine.     Our server was fantastic.  She was so super friendly and very attentive, despite the very busy (but small) dining room.    I look forward to returning.  The prices were reasonable and there were definitely some other entrees I'd like to try.  I'll just make sure to wear pants with an elastic waist.",

    "text": "What a lovely spot! A group of about 8 of us went to Crepe Cellar last night for dinner. The place is a little small, but that is one of my favorite things about this place. Since it's on the small side we had to wait for a 6 and a 4 top to be ready to accommodate us so we went to Growlers next door (both owned by the same people)  and grabbed some drinks while we waited for a our tables to be ready.   I had yellow fin tuna special and my sister had the mussels, and my goodness both where out of this world! The yellow fin crepe was amazing, deliciously spicy but perfectly cooked and balanced. The mussels melted in my mouth and the garlic was not over powering but perfect, oh god I'm thinking about the sauce and bread and I need to go back right now. This place is perfect for date night or just meeting up with a friend, or just go and eat yourself into a nap.",

It Is a bit pricey but totally understandable with its quality and the server was excellent.",

    "text": "My co-worker and I ate lunch here after taking suggestions from Yelp on where to eat. We were looking for a new spot. We work very near the Noda area, so it sent us to the Crepe Cellar.   Just like every other Noda eatery, this place was urban cool and eclectic. Hip music, minimalist motif, waitresses all in black. Kind of looked like they were trying to be fine dining on a budget.   They might have pulled it off, too, except for the gravy stains on our waitress's shirt. As is my habit, I asked her which was better - a crepe dish or the fish and chips that was voted as \"Charlotte's Best\".  She replied, \"Go with the fish and chips.  Our entree crepes are just so-so\". Brutally honest but suicidal at the same time. Perfect.   She was dead on. My fish and chips was great. Light and juicy with just the right amount of crunch in the battered outside. A GREAT sweet red slaw accompanied the cod. Decent fries, too. My partner had the same thing and was equally impressed.   She had added (during her per-meal analysis) that the dessert crepes were \"to die for\" so we added a shared $8 Crepe Suzette to our meal. Buttermilk crepes with a good sized scoop of butter rum ice cream .... And all of this swimming in a rum sauce. Very good, but I certainly wouldn't die for it. Not for 8 bucks, anyway.   All in all, a good meal. The biggest disappointment was when we got the check. Nearly $45 with tip. Pretty steep lunch - even for hip Noda!",

Couldn't taste anything but pesto and fries cheese could not come through all that. Onion soup sweet really sweet lots onions bland bland base not rich enough or deep enough. Crepe turkey apple compote shaved deli turkey really filling small amount crepe still doughy.  Mac and cheese now that was awesome some little zing at the end amazing. A bit to cheesy for me but worth it. Fish and chips which is supposed to be Charlottes best was good not great. It gets a lot of it's oomph from its presentation the smaller side of the fish was good when you got to the thicker part was a little too bland or really bland and slightly mushy with a heavier fish fat content. I should say about the fish it's about 3.5 inches thick at one side tapers down to about two inches  tube shaped and maybe 5-6 inches long. It looks really cool and the way the batter comes off sorta makes it look like a fish. 3.50 for a piece of cold bread not cool. It was supposed to be warmed baguette. Drink menu great and wine menu nice. Service was good and she was pleasant kept up with water sodas and such.  It's like it's close got good enough but didn't go further. What about a bechamel sauce on side for fries to tamper pesto and give it better flavor. Better base for onion soup.",

The original plan was to hit up Cabo Fish Taco, but their wait was about an hour and it was starting to sprinkle a bit.    The Crepe Cellar, also had a wait, but we were able to scrounge some space at the bar to booze it up before dinner.  We tried the Pesto Brie Fries (which were AWESOME) and I landed on the Spinach and Wild Mushroom Crepe.  The side I got was the purple slaw.... nothing to write home about, but unique and different.  I like how it was light and not doused with mayo like some slaws tend to be.  Was trying to save room for dessert, but I was stuffed.  I'll definitely have to come back to try a regular entree and dessert!  Overall our waiter was great and attentive (even for a busy night).  The atmosphere was very cool - I really liked how the specials were written on a mirror on the wall large enough to see from anywhere in the room.  I'm not a big fan of dark restaurants since I like to \"eat with my eyes\" first, but this was just to the point where dim was becoming too dark (a good balance!).",

The dining area was decorated with a stunning wood paneling and complete with a list of local farmers that the restaurant gets their products from. I loved that! Additionally, the staff was super helpful and welcoming!  After scanning their menu, I chose the classic Butter Sugar Crepe, so good! It wasn't too sweet and it came with a side of house-made whipped cream. Everything was so yummy and made-to-order. You could really taste how great the local produce was in each dish. I also got one of their seasonal items, a Granola Bowl topped with fresh fruit and a side of Greek Yogurt. It was light and refreshing, the perfect way to complete the meal! The granola was made in house with pumpkin seeds (yum!) and the berries tasted so fresh.   Overall, this was a really good experience and I will be stopping by the next time I find myself in the area. The prices are pretty average for a place that serves brunch. Parking was a little bit difficult and you may have to pay or find yourself walking a couple of blocks. A really great find in the middle of Charlotte! Stop by if you get the chance!",

We usually like to start out with a nice shot of tequila (patron to be exact) to get the evening going followed by their superb burrata (with several pieces of bread) then we usually like to dive into a beautifully made Queen City Crepe with either a side of their delicious fries or a very freshly made salad. During this absurd feast I usually partake in a few alcoholic beverages as well such as a Founders Gold or a very enjoyable Well's Banana Bread Brewski.  Once the meal is over (usually too full to try any of their dessert, which I'm sure is phenomenal as well) the bill is paid and we are on our way (usually to growlers).  One tip for you future cellar dwellers, make sure to get in line through the yelp app, as the wait is easily seen and you can plan to enjoy some pregamers at a neighboring bar.",

The first time I went for brunch I probably would have rated it 2 stars and been done with it. The food was overly-greasy and blah. LUCKILY, I was convinced by friends that came into town that Crepe Cellar \"Sounded and looked really good.\" Thank goodness we went back.  Crepe Cellar brunch is LEGIT. It's not the biggest menu, but everything I've had has been delicious and I highly recommend WHATEVER you want because from what I've seen, they do not make bad food. Some high points - Biscuit. You gotta get either the biscuits as a side or with your meal. Do NOT get toast. Get the biscuit. The French Onion Soup is ridiculous. I've only gotten it once but I will not go back and not get it again. It will be a regular thing going forward, guaranteed. The steak and eggs - bomb.   Also, I do not like bloody mary's but every person I know that has gotten one there has been a big fan. I'm told they're spicy so if that's your thing, you should probably order one.  I've been to Crepe Cellar once outside of brunch and it was for a new year's event where they, Haberdish, and Growler's Pourhouse had a joint event. I don't remember everything that I had that night but I remember being extremely impressed with all the food and the service.   Bottom line: 5 stars would/will eat again.",

For someone whose traveled to Europe a few times this is the closet to getting European food in the Queen City! No matter what you order you won't be disappointed! But be sure to order the pesto fries and French press coffee!",

There are a number of things I have eaten there and all were good. The burgers are good and the fries are great. The Roasted chicken, the Duck confit, and the hanger steak dishes are amazing. They also have a great selection of cocktails and beer. The Bartender does well with mixing drinks.  They have honestly never let me down. I had one of their Crepe specials and it was also good. You really can't go wrong. Swing by for a family dinner, a date or just a drink with friends. The decor sets the mood for either.",

It's crowded when we got there they said the wait was for an hour so they took our cell number and we would get text when our table is ready. So we stroll around and took some pictures of the murals then all of a sudden we got text it was only like 30 mins. Great! As I was hangry  I love the place/ambiance when got seated. Elisa who was friendly and attentive greeted us and took our order right away. For starters I ordered Roasted oysters and It was delightful I enjoyed it. My husband got the fish and chips and I got the Queen City crepes they are so delicious. I would recommend for everyone to try this French restaurant! Next time we will try their Charcuterie.",

I started with a coffee that came in a French Press. I love coffee, and guys, this might be it. Best cup I've had in a long long while. I drank it black because it didn't need a thing.   I had the special crepe of the day which featured braised short rib with gruyere and vegetables. They offer a gluten free crepe which was delicious. For a side I chose the slaw which I loved because it was a vinegar base rather than mayo. A couple of my fellow diners upgraded their sides to the French Onion Soup which also looked heavenly. I love a savory crepe and can't wait to go back to try the Turkey and Brie combo.  For dessert our table split the Nutella crepe (a classic that was perfectly executed), the pumpkin ice cream (HEAVEN to this pumpkin lover), an apple crepe (VERY sweet), and a twice baked brownie dish. The brownie was hands down everyone's favorite. It had walnuts in it and was warm with ice cream that melted into it. Chocolate desserts can be too rich, but this was perfect.  Awesome for large groups. I will absolutely be back.",

It's the cutest part of town, and parking can be a little bit of a pain (but there is a big lot across the street) but it is worth it.  We were alone in there for a good while, and the waitress was still kind to us and served us well.  She brought us all water and took our drink orders.  They don't have typical sodas on tap, but specialty sodas, locally bottled.  We sampled a cherry cola that was great!  We knew we were getting sweet crepes for dessert, so we all chose something else for lunch.  The French Club has smoked turkey, bacon, gouda with lettuce and tomato.  The French bread was crunchy and chewy and it was a perfect bite.  The Buttermilk Chicken Cordon Bleu was delicious, but the mustard was very forward.  Next time we'll ask for that on the side.  The fish and chips were cooked well, and not too greasy.    The crepes.  Oh my goodness.  Best part of the meal!  The crepe Suzette was my personal favorite, so much sweetness!  The crepe was tender and thin and the dollop of vanilla on top was the perfect foil for all of that sweet.  My daughter had the nutella and strawberry crepe, simple but delicious.  Our friend had the brownie crepe, and while she liked it, I found the brownie severely overcooked and crunchy.  It was my least favorite of the three.  We so enjoyed our meal here, and the service was really spectacular.  We will absolutely be back.",

The noise isn't bad so our foursome had a great conversation without having to yell. The restaurant is open concept so you can see a single TV if you choose your table accordingly. This is probably only important during big events ie: NFL playoffs and the boys wanted to see the game last night. Girls got a romantic, tasty meal and boys also got to see football - win win. Adorable decor, going for a Euro vibe - I dug it.   Specials rotate, which is nice because you know they are fresh and you can always try something new.  Drinks and wine list -  Nice, I was impressed. Even if you aren't eating this is a great place to grab a drink for a date or with friends.   Food -  Crepe Cellar Cheeseburger, the best thing we tried, it was amazing. The beef was flavorful and tender. Even though it was a basic bun and fried onions as garnish (not usually my choices) the flavor was fantastic. Definitely recommend.  Lamb Crepe, was expecting the lamb to be a different texture, it was shredded. The flavor wasn't all that great, and the pairings could have been better. The radish was fresh. It said tzatziki, but i surely didn't notice it on the dish.   Ribeye (because skirt steak was sold out) was very tough despite being cooked medium. It had a noticeably amount of fat as well. My friend was not a fan, and said he would not order it again as he does frequent the spot.  Short Rib, tender and juicy and good pairings. The friend that ordered this had tried it before and liked it, although I can't vouch.  Ice Cream - 3 types for $7. They make these in house and they were very creamy and rich. You could come here just for the ice cream and drinks and leave happily.  Muscles - these were probably the \"fishiest\" muscles I've ever had, I could only eat 4 of them even though they gave us the largest bowl of muscles I've ever seen! A+ for portion, C for flavor. They were so fishy that I just thought the first couple were bad, but all of them were consistent and I'm not sick yet. ;)   Parking - No lot, just street parking. On a cold Sunday there were spots, but normally there are not so just be prepared to drive around a while and walk a bit to get here.   Reservations - Also no, but they have the no wait app, ugh.   Service -  She was very nice, knowledgable, and attentive. We liked her very much.",

They have a wonderful brunch selection.  They have a variety of egg dishes, sandwiches and salads.  I tried the two eggs and the Eggs Benedict, and both were great.  The Bananas Foster with a scoop of vanilla was a really yummy and unnecessary way to end the meal, but there was no way I was walking out of there without a dessert crepe!  Definitely don't miss the French Press Coffee.  I love the little timer that comes with it so you can choose your coffee strength.  In a city where brunch spots aren't abundant, I would definitely recommend the Crepe Cellar.  It gets busy around 10am on the weekend, so try hitting up this place before then.  Can't wait to come back for dinner!",

Always memorable for me are the pesto fries, I can't make a stop in here without ordering a plate as a warmup. Last night however I wasn't impressed with the burger I ordered. They advertised their burger as having a garlic aoli spread but they seemed to apply very little and it was left without much flavor. Also I had asked for it to be cooked medium and it was very pink. I don't usually mind if a medium request comes out medium rare (happens often at restaurants), but this was bordering on rare making it not very enjoyable for me. Still I had a great evening and the service was fantastic as always. I am still a big fan of this establishment but in the future I will likely avoid the burger.",

I've been for lunch and for brunch and enjoyed both. Warm atmosphere with exposed brick walls and aged wood floors and accents throughout balanced with lots of windows and natural light. Friendly staff.   Try the Queen City Crepe. It has a delicious texture and flavor pulling together the roasted chicken, bacon, cheddar, tomatoes, and dressing. Yummy. Also the ham and gruyere Crepe is fantastic. Try the onion soup (a little on the sweet side but excellent).   Not in the mood for a crepe?  No problem.  Go for the steak frites. Perfectly seasoned and seared meat worthy of a steakhouse. Or go for the fish and chips, with a great beer batter that is perfectly crispy and not greasy while oozing with moisture and flavor on the inside.   For sides go for the purple slaw and Brussels.",

    "text": "You had me at buckwheat!   I am a nut for buckwheat, and really anything that goes above and beyond flour. Flour is blah. Buckwheat is so nutritious and full of minerals and fiber, and let's not forget it's totally delicious! My friend ranted a raved a little about this place, setting it up with quite the lofty praise that \"everything there is good\". My jaded and suspicious heart (which has yet to get over the disappointment of the Blair Witch Project hype) immediately began looking for ways to prove her wrong. ...... Then I saw \"buckwheat\" on the menu. In fact all of the crepes are made with buckwheat. ..Squee!  I hemmed and hawed and landed on the turkey, apple, brie crepe and the slaw. I don't normally like slaw, but something (fate!?) led me to order it. And I beheld it. And I tasted it. And it was glorious. All of it. The crepe was delicious and just the right serving size. The slaw was a red (purple?) cabbage with just the right liquid mixture. i could eat that slaw every day.   My companion had one of the sandwiches, but requested it on a crepe. They'll do that, because they're awesome. She also ordered the pesto fries. As far as I could tell, her meal was thoroughly enjoyed. The pesto fries had a great taste and are definitely a dish to share. They are, however, slightly too salty and soggy for me to say I love them. I can only recommend them and hope that the s&s concern is shared by others and will be fixed in the future.  Mixed drinks were good. Food was good. Buckwheat was delicious. Truly \"everything there is good\". I do have to warn you that the place is really loud. The sound carries very strangely in some of the old warehouse-ish buildings. I could hear the guy diagonal from me and 5 feet away better than I could hear my friend across from me. Expect a lot of shouting and for your conversation to be overheard by your neighbors.",

We split two bottles among 5 of us and it was the perfect amount. To shared the burrata start, it was creamy flavorful and the perfect compliment to the grilled bread. Our waiter was nice enough to make sure we had extra bread so that we could all share. I had the spinach and wild mushroom crepe, while I appreciated that they use buckwheat for their savory crepes I didn't find this to be the best or most authentic rendition, however it was good. I paired it with the house salad, which was plentiful for a side portion, and quite fresh and delicious. Another friend ordered the crepe stuffed with a brownie and topped with ice cream, I had a bite and it was amazing, the brownie was so moist! Overall, we had a wonderful time and everyone was pleased with the food and service. It worked out well for a small group but also has an intimate vibe that would be great for a date or special occasion. I look forward to returning!",

The brussels sprouts are perfection in a bowl.  My date and I shared those and split a burger since neither of us was starving.  Now, I'm no burger connoisseur but on the rare occasion I order one I want it to be off the charts.  So often at restaurants I'm disappointed by the lack of flavor in the all American burger.  How hard can it be?  Well, Crepe Cellar nails it with their signature burger.  We ordered it medium rare, and it was absolutely, hands down, the best burger I've been served.  Anywhere.  Hated to share it.  The service is always good.  Never fawning, always comfortably attentive, and the servers are good at making suggestions.  I was considering a fun cocktail which is atypical for me, and they described it to a tee.  Delish!",

The menu is very diverse, with all sorts of brunch items from standard egg/meat/carb plates, to crepes sweet and savory, and things like french toast and a really tasty looking burger. The sage honey butter biscuits were delicious!! I just wish the butter came on the side instead of pre-smeared on top.  I wanted more of it, and I wanted it on more than just the top layer of the biscuit! It was delicious though.  I had the sausage egg and cheese crepe.  It was ok, but didn't knock my socks off. It needed a little salsa or something to jazz it up, and I didn't like the gluten friendly crepe wrapper. The grits were really really good as a side dish though.  BF had the french toast which was amazing and the omelet of the day.  The omelet was made incorrectly initially and our server apologized and fixed it before even bringing it out, and comped it at the end of the meal because of the delay. I ogled the burgers at the table next to us, they looked amazing. There were many fancy beverage options, but we didn't imbibe. For a Sunday brunch the restaurant had good traffic and stayed busy but we were seated immediately. Not the best brunch I've ever had, but definitely solid and recommended.",

But dont be expecting this place to only satisfy your dessert cravings, they are a bunch of show offs that declares to the world crepes can be real food too.  Crepes for breakfast, crepes for brunch, lunch, dinner and dessert they do get creative. I myself ordered their burger because crepes are forever a dessert food for me, but my so ordered one of the crepes as a brunch dish and it wasnt too bad. Itll take me a few trips to convert me tho.  The place was overall very clean and hip, maybe even too hip. Hipster central, guess thats why they charge like 10 dolars a crepe. But it was still good. Service was good, tho they never wrote down our orders and forgot a sausage on the so's crepe, which they corrected later. Should probably write down a customer's order on the spot, hipsters are smart but like 90% hot air.  Overall a very interesting experience that will change your preconceptions of crepes forever. Either you'll come to love crepes even more, or outright hate em from now on. Hopefully it's the former. For me Im not sure. Good luck my friends.",

Almost too small for the demand.   For my entree I got the spinach and wild mushroom savory buckwheat crepe and added chicken for an additional charge. I also substituted and got a house salad for my side item. The crepe was okay. It was nothing special. Before going, I was kind of not that into it because when I think of crepes I think of delicious dessert-y things like fruit and chocolate. But I decided to give the savory buckwheat crepes a try. I was not blown away. Everything tasted good, but it just wasn't something I would ever crave. The friend I was with ordered the rosemary and thyme roasted chicken. That was also good - but who goes to a crepe restaurant for a half a chicken?   We split the banana fosters dessert crepe. Obviously this was the highlight of the meal. The crepe was cooked perfect, fresh bananas, good taste. Very rich of course. If I go back and I would just order ALL OF THE DESSERT CREPES. haha",

    "text": "\"Woohoo, as good as it gets!\" is on the money for me when it comes to Crepe Cellar. I love this place and I seriously daydream about it often and get excited whenever its in the mix as a dinner option. To start, its got a great personality - its dimly lit, the decor is intimate and personable as the place itself is more on the smaller side. Because it is on the smaller side, sometimes there is a wait. However, it is nice that they take your number to text you so you can pop on over to a nearby bar to grab a drink and be alerted when you're about to be in for a treat!  Okay, let me state the obvious - Pesto Brie Fries. Do not ever not order these. They should always be ordered, no matter how many times you have had them. I love fries, I love cheese, and I love pesto and the mix of all three, my goodness, phenomenal. They have never had an 'off day' or come out soggy or lacking in toppings, they are just always fantastic and worth eating your weight in fries.   The rest of the menu is just as fantastic. We have tried quite a few things off the menu and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Its one of those places where I could order my favorite thing over and over but I legitimately want to try everything. Their dinner crepes are well sized and stuffed and are very good, as are their pizzas.  They have changing specials and these are aaaalways SO delicious. I have tried their swordfish and a PBR bacon mussels option and I enjoyed them so much, I went home to try and find/pathetically recreate the recipes. (I have yet to succeed in this endeavor). I am anxiously looking forward to the short rib option, as last time they were out - so I will clearly need to return soon for this. As for dessert, somehow, I have yet to have a dessert crepe here - I dont know how as I love crepes and I love dessert, so something is wrong here and I'll fix this soon.   Point is, this place is truly 'as good as it gets.' Their waitstaff is attentive, polite, timely, and truly interested in their customers and that is a huge plus. The food is so delicious and I want to try everything and so should you. Now, go. Don't forget to order the fries. ::drools a little::",

I tried the Ham and Gruyere crepes and really enjoyed them.  The shoestring fries (or Frites) were really good as well.  Really salty and crispy.  All in all, I would definitely like to go back to this establishment so that I can try some other menu items.",

We got there just as they opened the door. The waitresses were beautiful, the chefs looked badass, and the barkeep looked like the dude from Afro Samurai, with his afro, sans samurai sword. I thought they would have a huge selection of Crepes to choose from, but I was wrong. The menu was concise with few choices. This helps the indecisive customer. I ordered the Ham and Gruyere Crepe, it was the square one. I took a picture of it. It was absolutely delicious. The crepe itself was just perfect, it wasn't too soggy, there wasn't too much cheese. The maple mustard sauce they drizzled on top made my taste buds explode in delectable ecstasy. I would rate this dish 5 stars. My brother ordered the queen city crepe. It was not as good. I would rate that one 3 stars. The shrimp with grits my mom ordered was very flavorful, but the portion size was ridiculously small. How much do grits cost? Probably less than rice, and rice don't cost that much. The pricing is a bit expensive as well. But due to the beautiful waitresses and the afro samurai, along with the extremely delicious crepes, this place gets a 4 star! Would definitely come back next time they do another Groupon deal.",

You can taste more of the crepe, rather than their filling on the inside. I got the Queen City Crepe, and well it just leaves a little bit of a disappointment. My date ordered the french toast, and it just tasted very plain. It probably could've used alittle more batter. I also ordered the Brownie a Blanket Sundae. The brownie was a bit dry, the nutelle was yummy. You can never go wrong with the nutella. I do have to say it was definitely packed in there but I guess it's the local NODA residents that are faithful. But I do think, there can definitely be some improvement. For brunch, I would say Pewter Rose or Pike's Soda Shop really hits the spot.",

First 3 times were fabulous (would rate a five if it wasn't for most recent experience), couldn't wait to go back, 4th time, a little disappointed in some of the food and hostess was very rude.  When I put my name on the list I asked for an approximate wait time.  The hostess seemed very insulted that I asked, she said \"I CANNOT predict how long the wait will be...there are three parties ahead of you.\"  We waited about one hour.  Sat at bar while we waited- the bartender is FABULOUS, he is very attentive and knows ALL about the wine selection (as a bartender should).  Our waitress was very attentive.  The Queen City crepes were very dry but had great flavor, the last time I had them they were MUCH better.  The ham and gruyere crepes were drenched in the bechamel sauce which made them seem almost like a breakfast or brunch item, too much sauce, too sweet, but also VERY good flavor.  The  succotash is AMAZING!  And the crepe suzette is to die for!!!  I was also a little disappointed that there was a table with about 6 screaming children next to us, not the fault of the restaurant...Very reasonable prices!",

Granted, I live right up the street, but my frequent visits were more about the experience than the convenience.   My menu favorites -- Starters: Pesto Brie French Fries Savory Crepes: Spinach & Wild Mushroom, Queen City, Turkey & Brie Sandwiches: Crepe Cellar Burger Sweet Crepes: Bananas Foster, Nutella & Bananas (Add Strawberries!)  Add a side of melt-in-your-mouth mac & cheese for $1.50. Worth every penny.   Because Crepe doesn't take reservations, as they are an intimate setting (which I hope never changes), you should plan to get there early on a weekend night to compete with the crowd.

Everything from the decor to the dessert was terrific.  I started with their house blend French press coffee - so good.  My husband is a connoisseur of iced teas and I think this place topped his list.  My husband had a crepe with mushrooms, goat cheese and caramelized scallions and I had one with roasted chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese and drizzled with a roasted tomato cream.  Both were excellent.  My side salad was also great, and we both loved his hand cut french fries.   But, I didn't finish my meal - because I decided to save room for dessert - we shared a Suzette crepe, which was gone in probably 30 seconds, both of us fighting for bites of the sauce and vanilla bean ice cream on top.  If we lived in the area we'd be back.  Wish they'd open a spot like this in Houston!",

Entrees were brought out in two waves which left that awkward 5 minutes or so for those early recipients, during which the other 3 of us had to make the obligatory command to 'please eat,' even though everyone knows it's rude to eat in front of hungry people. -Cold fries on the first wave of entrees also earns them a few demerits.",

It comes with yummy goodness sweet potato (most likely it's drown in honey) and a little green beans (oh what make a plate seem healthy with green glazed in butter). In conclusion the plate was a ok. We also ordered banana strawberry crepe for dessert. It comes with nutella and powdered sugar ladies and gents! Oooohh I so would run four miles just to get them again. Yea... I probably need about 20 miles run to burn the calories but if you can afford it... GET IT! :) Just remember when you're there... the place is LOUD! Yea if you're trying to know your date, trust me the table next to you would know your date also by the end of the night.",

Charcuterie appetizer kinda small for $12, but had great olives that I had never had before and they had no pits!  Generous side salad Mushroom spinach crepe goat cheese so so according to one of fellow diners. Good service.  Very popular so go early before Gallery Crawl. We parked in the YMCA lot for free.",

Since it is so small I imagine that the only reason we were able to sit right away was due to the snowy weather.  But that was great for us! My co-diners and I decided to share two dessert crepes - Nutella and Bananas and Brownie in a Blanket.  Both were delicious however the brownie crepe was the winner simply because it included nutella, ice cream and whipped cream.   I would recommend the Crepe Cellar for a dessert destination!",

The french onion soup was well-rounded, much more flavorful than I thought it would be.  I got the four cheese crepe.  The presentation could have used a little work (they use these spiral, metal wire containers for the fries which seemed un-necessary and actually made it difficult to get the fries out, and the crepe was set on the plate with no garnish, very pale-looking) but the flavors were wonderful!  Of course we had the nutella and banana crepe for desert which was rich and satisfying.    This would have been five stars had our service been a little better.  Went for lunch with a living social coupon and the place was busy (which may explain some of the service issues) but we were directed to seat ourselves and grabbed a table right away.  The server (Colleen, I believe) was mostly competent but not very friendly or conversational.  I asked to taste two wines and she brought out the wrong one... luckily I liked the other selection so I didn't make a fuss.  Overall, delicious and we will be back to try some of their dinner entrees.",

    "text": "My friend's cousin took us to this place as she'd heard a lot about it. I never say no to crepes, so in we went. It was an interesting vibe, good concept, not too full in the late afternoon. Friend and I thought we could take advantage of happy hour deals but we were promptly told by the waitress that there is NO happy hour in all of North Carolina. What a travesty! We almost didn't believe her and then learned, you Charlotte-ians have worked your way around that problem. You just call them \"specials\" and offer them all day long (and I'm not sure how exactly this all day special is supposed to prevent binge drinking...) Whatever, as long as I get my $1 off that beer.   Onto the food - I only sampled the crepes the other two gals had. One was a sausage and peppers with shallots, and the sausage was delicious, but there wasn't enough stuffing, and I wasn't a fan of the buckwheat crepe, it just doesn't taste good on its own. With more stuffing and flavor, this crepe would have been delish. The other crepe was the wild mushroom and spinach with caramelized shallots and goat cheese, so I was expecting a lot of great flavors. But it too fell short, it needed more salt and seasoning, and more stuffing.  The slaw was decent, I prefer this vinegar slaw to the regular slaw.  The beer was good, wish they had \"specials\" on the wine, and the service was ok, a little over-attentive, and then a little over-apologetic when we noted our \"special\" on the beer wasn't accounted for.",

The French press coffee comes with its own timer so you can brew it perfectly to your tastes. The food is exceptional. (we plan to here tomorrow, it's that good). We opted for two of the savory buckwheat crepes. The turkey apple brie is perfectly balance the the light and delicate flavors all complementing each other. The ham and Gruyere cheese with the maple Dijon glaze was hearty and flavorful. The chef is obviously a musician creating a symphony of flavors! The sides were good enough to be stand alone. Definitely try the purple slaw and if you love brussel sprouts, they are a must. We did not try any of the home craft cocktails but the menu was impressive.",

We started with the burrata which is made in house and it was delicious. I got the burger which was amazing, the garlic aioli made the burger.

    "text": "After reading so many positive reviews I finally made my way to NODA to check out this place. We were seated in a comfortable over-sized booth against the front windows so we were able to people watch while eating.   The interior is pleasing and appeared very clean.   NODA foot traffic has really picked up during the daytime but the area really comes to life after dark. But back to the food.   The first thing that surprised me on this menu was the wide variety of food in general. If you aren't a crepe person, they have burgers, subs, pizza and an array of sides including fresh-cut fries and brussel sprouts, yummmmm! I ordered the Queen City Crepe and paid $1 extra for a side of fries. I am a french fry junkie and when they are fresh-cut, the more likely I am to eat there. All their crepes use Buckwheat and at first I was a little hesitant since I was not familiar with the taste. But WOW!! This makes the 5th crepe restaurant I have tried over the past year and Crepe Cellar wins hands down (not saying the others were bad). The overall taste of this crepe, which included bacon, chicken and cheese (and a few other things I can't remember) was absolutely delicious. Kudos to the chef !! Oh, and those fresh-cut fries will have me back in no time.   With the food being this good, it was hard not to pass on dessert. We decided to split the Strawberry Creme Cheesecake. It was so good, I bought one to go. I cannot wait for my next visit. As much as I liked the crepe, I am tempted to try a burger or the chicken cordon bleu. I can only imagine how good these would be seeing how good the crepes were.",

I settled in at the bar to check out the lunch options and was pleasantly surprised to learn about the lunch special  - $8 for selected entrees  plus $1 more for my choice of side items.   I chose the Queen City Crepe.  It is made with roasted chicken, cheddar, tomatoes, and oven roasted tomato sauce in a buckwheat crepe. (It also normally comes with bacon, but I had them leave it off of mine.)  It was a toss up between the hand-cut fries or the mac-n-cheese, but the mac-n-cheese won out. I was not disappointed because it was creamy and full of flavor.  As it turns out, they make it to order with Bechamel sauce and 4 cheeses. Yummo!  The place is cute and service was very friendly. Since I was there for lunch and had to go back to work, I didn't partake of any of the adult beverages, but they looked to have a good selection - especially wines & beers.  I would definitely recommend checking it out if you are looking for a tasty place to grab a bite to eat.",

It's one of our few go-to's that isn't in the super pricey category.  Park across the street behind the building with the Fifth Third bank in it if you can't find space on the street or in the small lot behind the restaurant.  Cool kids pass their ticket to those coming in and save a new friend the $5!  Atmosphere is cozy and casual. Have been there plenty of times when all tables are full and never too loud.   French onion soup is a good preparation and the bowl is a massive cheesy crock of goodness.   Steak frites with Hangar steak as the cut is delicious. Always order med rare and it always comes out that way. Fries are delicious hand cut shoestrings. Great pan sauce served atop. Always a winner and fairly priced around $23. Very big portion.   I love the burger there. Fancy cheese and crispy fried onion strings. Great bun and served with the aforementioned fries for $12 is a good one.   Daily muscles special that works well as a big app or a small dinner. Never had a bad one and they serve with nice crusty bread to sop up the sauce.   Beer list is always impressive and changing, and I like that they have a lengthy list of wines by the glass all for $6.  Crepes Suzette for desert is so, so good.  Not too sweet and have to try a crepe when you're there.",

It's creamy and literally just melts in your mouth. Best grits I've ever had! But don't get me wrong, everything else on the menu is just as great. Also, their French pressed coffee is so YUM! Fresh and taste wonderful.  Now about the service. Usually when we go they do get pretty busy so we do have to wait a little while, which we don't mind because everyone here is always so kind. Even if you plan to go right when they open you'll see that there's already people waiting outside. Our server is always very attentive unless it gets really busy which is understandable. It's definitely a nice environment to be in!",

The only small complaint I have is that because our table was in the aisle servers kept bumping into the back of my chair each time they passed. Next time I'll ask for a booth ;-)",

We also got the Spinach and mushroom Crepe as well as the Ham and gruyere. I personally wasn't a fan of the Ham and gruyere, but Yolanda was more than willing to get get me the Crepe I wanted. Was to full for desert, but will definitely be back! Would definitely recommend trying.",

    "text": "First of all, order the pesto brie fries as an appetizer - they're a must! This may sound strange, but we go to the crepe cellar specifically for their burger. It is seriously one of the best burgers in Charlotte - rivaling those on the menus of specialty burger joints. The flavor of the beef paired with the gruyere cheese, onion straws, and garlic aioli is out of this world. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I ordered the mac and cheese as a side and it was outstanding. On top of this, the cocktails are great & service is wonderful. Highly recommend!",

We ventured in on a Friday evening; I'd always pictured more of a bakery inside, but it was the cutest, quaintest restaurant with candles lining the window, cozy lighting, and a comfy bar, which is where we sat.  We started with the Brussels sprouts - the whole reason we went - and they were divine. For dinner, the fella got the fish and chips, which were way too big for the plate they came on! He said it was pretty tasty. I got the ham and Gruyere cheese crepe, which had a sweet maple drizzle on top... yum. Then we had to get the nutella and banana crepe. The fella got one bite, which I thought was very generous of me.   I'm not always a crepe fan since they usually seem too heavy or too light, but Crepe Cellar is just right. I hate that it took us this long to get there, and now I can't wait to go again!",

Unique menu with items in all categories and all price levels.  Food was good.  Burger was great but the veggie burger was cold, they swapped it out quickly, and gave me a free glass of wine to hold me over until it arrived.   Would definitely give them another try.   Maybe Grumpy will have the day off.",

We shared the special Crepe which had beef brisket. It was also very tasty. Drinks were good as well, a bit on the pricey side though.  My one complaint was the seating. We were over in the back at a two top table and across from us was a half moon style table with six people. Because of the small space, we heard their entire conversation and it was very loud! Our quiet and romantic dinner became not so very fast. However, we've been here before and really love the food and overall vide. Will be back.",

Then here is where it begins.  We order the mussels \"sorry we ran out\" ohhhhhhK we will take the pork belly \"sorry we ran out\" fine. We both ordered the crepes, 1 mushroom and 1 ham and a side of brussel sprouts.  Then i order a glass of wine.  Sorry, \"we ran out\"   OMG.  Waited forever for drinks, service was average at best.  Ok here comes our crepes which were overcooked and then \"sorry we ran out of brussel sprouts\" This is insane, the whole experience and quality of food and service was just bad.",

That is why I was so amazed that their home fries were actually great! They have a seasoning mix of old bay and brown sugar that make them a crispy mix of savory and sweet. - The french onion soup was on point.",

I'm a big fan of subway tiles and the restroom displayed them brilliantly.   As soon as you walk in the restaurant, you're greeted by the hostess while passing the full service bar with top shelf liquor and a cooled featured wine fridge. Most of their menu is chalked on the board along side the seating area with their specials also chalked.   Service is quick and on point. Our waitress Sara took our orders and quickly got us our cocktails, and appetizers. The drinks were great. A mix of all types of top shelf liquor spruced up with a sour, sweets and bitters. Our appetizer was steamed mussel with smokey bacon, jalapenos in a beer broth with fresh bread to soak up the flavors of the broth.   Our entrees were nothing short of spectacular. Seared tuna on a bed of steamed kale with roasted garlic quinoa and a grilled tomato cream sauce. The fish and chips was a large portion of beer battered cod and hand cut fries served with ketchup, tarter and malt vinegar on the side.   For dessert we had a Bananas Foster which is a warm crEpe with bananas and whip cream.   This place was perfect for us. Highly recommend it.",

It took 2 bartenders over 15 minutes to even come get our order....and they weren't even that many people ordering drinks!!   After 30 minutes waiting, we finally got to our table. Granted, this place is tiny and everyone is sitting quite close to each other. The only nice person working here was the man who came out with our dishes.  We ordered the gnocchi and the spinach crepe. The gnocchi was blah--it tasted like soft raw dough balls and the crepe itself was good, but the filling with the goat cheese was kind of bland. We would have ordered dessert, but the way it was understaffed, we figured it would have taken another 30 minutes just for the waitress to come back and see how we were doing, so we just left.  Would not come back here again unless it was a random Tues, Wed early afternoon and I was starving.",

    "text": "In August I purchased a living social coupon for Crepe Cellar that cost $20 for $40 worth of food. My first attempt to try it out happened to be on a Monday, and when we arrived, we saw that they weren't open. Sadly, we had to dine elsewhere. But last weekend a friend and I decided at the last minute to check it out, and I was not disappointed. A breakdown of dinner:  1. Soup of the day - poblano sweet potato - very good but quite spicy. We didn't actually order any of this, but they said we could try if we wanted, so we did. 2. Chili shrimp appetizer - very good - solid amount of shrimp and a large baguette to dip in the chili sauce. 3. Salads - my friend and I both got a salad and were pleased with our choices. She ordered the Charcuterie salad with chicken and I got the Endive & Apple salad with grilled shrimp. The ginger maple dressing on my salad was phenomenal. 4. We split the brownie in a blanket dessert, which is actually that - a huge brownie wrapped in a crepe with a scoop of ice cream and a humongous scoop of whip cream. Really good thing we decided to split dessert because it would have been impossible to each eat our own.  We arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday, so got a parking spot on the street and didn't have to wait. But the place quickly filled up (there's not a ton of seating), so I'd try to make reservations or not show up at peak times if you don't want to wait. It's a bit dark in there, but very cool vibe overall. And the service was good, although food was a bit pricey. Yay for living social coupons!",

    "text": "I'd like to give Crepe Cellar more stars, but every experience I've had here rounds out to really just OK. Some nights it's really spotty service and a delicious meal, others it's spectacular service and a lackluster meal. Last night was pretty much the same story.   We ordered the cellar plate (meats & cheeses) and it was dropped off without any description. We figured most of it out on our own, but the whole time we were enjoying it I couldn't get the server's attention to give us a rundown. We didn't get checked in on until our entrees were brought to the table, and when we finally go to ask about a certain cheese, we couldn't even be given a straight answer. How do you not know what the chefs are plating up?   Our entrees were fairly good. The flavors of the duck dish were great even though parts of the protein were a little tough (the middle was seared beautifully). The Queen City Crepe was delicious, and with a side a fries very filling (though yes, a good portion of them were as mike k described \"crumb fries\").    Will I find myself eating at crepe cellar again? Most likely. They offer a menu selection somewhat rare for NoDa, and you can't pass up their great beer options. (Plus, I have a feeling CC has the potential for a five star evening it in somewhere...) Also, on busier nights I love that I can put my name in and then mosey on over to growlers for a drink or two until my table is ready.",

    "text": "Hmmmm...we had such high hopes!    We went there for a Saturday lunch today.  When we walked in the place was full, but we only had to wait about 2 minutes for a table to open up.  Nearly perfect timing!  It was a beautiful day, so NoDA was packed with pedestrians, and we considered ourselves fortunate to grab a table so quickly.  A few minutes later our waitress took our drink and appetizer orders.  They have very little available for children to drink - no juices other than what they use at the bar, and no milk.  For kids who don't like soda or plain water, there's not much choice.  My son ended up drinking nothing for the entire meal because he hates soda and they didn't have milk or juices available.  For the apps we ordered the mussels and the brussel sprouts.  The mussels were delicious and I could have eaten those all day long.  I found the brussel sprouts to be VERY bitter and could only eat 3-4 before the overwhelming bitterness became too much.  About five minutes after our appetizers arrived, the kids' food arrived at the table.  We finished our apps soon after that and then waited....and waited...and waited.  Our kids were halfway done with their food before our waitress came over to refill a glass and I asked where the food for the two adults was.  She said it was coming out next.  So we waited...and waited.  For about 30 more minutes.  By then our kids were long since done with their food, and getting bored just sitting there (thank heavens for phones with games galore!).  Methinks the waitress forgot to put in the complete order - that's the only thing I can think that would have caused such a major delay.  But we kept our smiles through the whole thing, continuing to keep the kids occupied while we waited.  FINALLY she brought out our food, and apologized for the long wait.  It's not like we ordered complicated food.  My husband got one of their standard crepes and I got a burger (having originally planned to have a dessert crepe).   There was NO REASON that burger and those crepes should have taken nearly 45 minutes to come out to the table (which was the time from when the appetizers were cleared away to when the food finally arrived).  Other tables around us were being served - including tables that arrived AFTER us.  Anyway, despite the wait, the food was good.  My husband enjoyed his crepe (spinach and mushrooms) and my burger was perfectly cooked and with amazing flavor.    As we were finishing, our waitress came over and apologized for the long delay and said she would reduce our bill as an apology.  She also asked if we wanted a dessert crepe, but in the end we decided against it.  We didn't feel like waiting anymore and wanted to get back out into the sunshine to enjoy the rest of our day.  Will we go back?  Probably not.  While the food was good, it wasn't a meal that made us say, \"WOW - WE HAVE TO GO BACK!\"  Add in the slow service (the restaurant was always full, but surely they should be used to that given how few tables they have?) and it's not a place to which we'd return.",

They were voted best fish and chips and best fries in 2011, so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I could most likely eat french fries for my only meal for the rest of my life, so to be voted the best of the best, well.....they need to be pretty unbelievable. I ended up upgrading to the best of 2011 fries with my fish and was sorta disappointed. They were topped with pesto and brie just as the menu says, but I didn't find this to add to their flavor. If anything it took away from the yummy fries that are good just served plain. The fish was excellent. Crispy and fried perfectly. It came with a side of thinly sliced cole slaw which was ok. The service was ok although the waitress shot my friend and me a nasty look for looking at pictures on our phone together, as if we were disturbing her. The place was also very loud and when I mean loud, I had to shout at the person across from me which made me just want to eat in silence and not talk at all. I most likely would come back for the fish and chips and maybe then I'll try a dessert crepe.",

When you order a French onion soup it caramelized onions with cheese on top. One of the most disgusting things I have ever had. Should have never been called a soup, it has zero broth. I love French onion soup and this was a fricken disgrace. I would be itself ashamed. The service was beyond slow. I am definitely what one called a foodie and this is a disgrace to food. Olive Garden serves better soup.  Not to mention I watched someone else get a soup and looked way better than mine but our waiter told us that's just how the soup is. The restaurant was almost empty and we were seated in a back corner as if to hide us. I have worked in the restaurant industry for many years and this place is an absolute disgrace. Needs major improvement. Not to mention that when you order a beer it is only a 6 oz. pour when you are paying for a 12 oz. pour. As a fermentation science major this is just pathetic. Next time I'll just bring my own bottles.",

Our waitress came out and apologized that the kitchen had overcooked my steak and they were cooking me a new one and that she had talked to the manager and our entire meal and drinks were on the house. We were really surprised that they were so proactive and that they covered everything. They brought us out desert and kept offering free drinks/ coffee etc all on the house.

The service was a bit slow despite the fact that there weren't that many people there.  However, the food was excellent!  I have been there a couple times now and had the Queen City crepe and the special with sausage/red pepper.  It was all very good.   I also made a mistake of ordering a dessert wrap with the mistaken belief I would be able to eat that with lunch.  Well, I did eat it, it was excellent, and I suffered for the rest of the day.  Overall, the only reason I knocked it down a star is because the service has been slow every time I have gone.

    "text": "Why, oh why, does this place have so many stars?  I visited tonight and I split the Brie fries, spinach and mushroom crepe and the spinach poached pears salad.  First let me rewind, I ordered the Hendricks cocktail.  I normally don't like gin but this was delicious!  It was super sophisticated and great for the summer.  My only regret was not ordering another.  Unfortunately it went downhill then settled on a bland plateau for the rest of the meal.  Fries-honestly still not sure what I think.  I'd like to pick the brain of whoever created this dish.  I can't say I hated it but I also can't say I loved it.  It was just a strange combination.  The Brie and pesto also wasn't well distributed, it was mainly on top.  Dip the fries in ketchup and they are just as addictive as regular fries.  Spinach/mushroom crepe- bland, bland, bland.  It tasted exactly like it sounded.  I tried to add salt but destroyed my crepe in the process so I just gave up and ate it.  Salad- again, lackluster.  The shallot dressing was very nice but definitely not hard to execute.  Everything else on the salad was whatevs.  Oh yes, it came with 4 small (overcooked) shrimp for an extra 3.50.  Not the best deal but you do what you gotta do for protein.    I just don't get the appeal of this place.  I tasted the other meals at my table and they were all bland as well (stay away from the pesto pasta-not worth the calories).   Just a note: the service was really good and our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  Our table loved her!  Good job Crepe Cellar management.",

    "text": "A Tale of Two Fish and Chips  Had an order of Fish and Chips on Thursday...some of the best I've had anywhere.  Thick tender melt in your mouth cod..perfectly prepared, I was in heaven.  Bragged about it to friends.  Couldn't stop thinking about it.  So today, Sunday,  I roll in about 3:00pm to lay down $15.00 for the best darn Fish in Chips in Charlotte.  Remembering how large and filling my previous dinner was, I skipped the wonderful Brussel sprouts appetizer.  Finally, I'm about to be rewarded for my long journey.....and what?  What's this?  Are you kidding me?  The fish is gray, barely cooked in spots.  Has the appearance of poorly frozen fish, before being uninspiringly battered and deep fried.  I eat it all after having driven from South Charlotte and just not in the mood to make a scene.   Absolutely nothing like my experience just a few days before.  Honestly, I've had better from Ms. Paul's. I mention my impression to the bartender who is sympathetic, comps my beer, but apparently the management or the chef doesn't think it's important enough to address with me.  Based on this experience, I won't be returning for their \"Award Winning\" Fish and Chips any time soon.  Just way to expensive an outing for this type of inconsistency and lack of customer awareness.  I just feel so ripped off...",

    "text": "So after a string of realy good meals in Charlotte lately, I was significantly underwhelmed  by a Saturday night meal at Crepe Cellar. Underwhelmed is probably too nice...because it wasn't for the stellar fried cod...the place sucked. Five dishes - French Onion Soup, sauteed garlic shrimp, house salad (mixed greens with crostini and red wine vinagrette), fish and chips and shrimp and grits.   French Onion soup...this was like dishwater except dishwater has more flavor...theme for the night was \"we don't care if we flavor our food). How do you mess this old school classic up? You can even use beef bouillon cubes and throw some decent gruyere and crostini in and salvage it...I have never had to salt, salt and salt my French Onion Soup...they need to learn a lesson from Captial Grille or Lulu in this department...not off to good start.   Sauteed shrimp...this was supposed to be like the Cajun Queen version...except Cajun Queen knows how to do bbq shrimp...granted there's is over the top with garlic and butter, but isn't that what you expect from this type of dish? Once again my dad (who, keep in mind, is 75 and usually eats at places like Pier 51 at 5:30PM with my mom...and considers Dragonfly a fancy place) and I are both searching for the salt shaker...for \"New Orleans\" bbq shrimp!!!! You know when you can look at a shrimp and see that it's best days were probably 3 months ago when they froze it??? They were decent size sauteed shrimp at one time, but freezer burn and time took their toll...at least I could tell they were pre-BP...probably Vietnamese tiger shrimp (2 for one Harris Teeter), but I digress. That's what these shrimp looked like - I was worried about the shimp being off more than I was them being flavorless...but they were a pretty good combination of both. The brothy goodness you would expect from this was basically a version of their French Onion soup broth/with UNSALTED butter. Then to add insult to injury, their bread was some Le Brea knock-off that wasn't even toasted to hide the staleness!   House salad - mixed greens with red wine vinagrette...can we move on? How do you ruin a mixed green salad? I don't know...ask the chef at Crepe Cellar.   Shrimp and Grits - I wasn't really excited about getting this after my bbq shrimp, but the waitress insisted this was the best thing on the menu (I give her the skunk-eye at this point...and thank her for another Jack and Diet). We ask for a larger salt shaker in anticipation...The shrimp were at least from a different batch than the sauteed boys...overdone - probably finished in the grits for too long. The tasso gravy needed salt. Let me pause for a wikpedia entry:    Tasso ham is a specialty of Cajun cuisine. It is a spicy, peppery version of smoked pork made from the shoulder butt. In this case, \"ham\" is a misnomer, since tasso is not made from the hind leg of a pig. This cut is typically fatty and, because the muscle is constantly used by the animal, has a great deal of flavor. The butt, which will weigh 7 to 8 pounds, is sliced across the grain into pieces about 3 in / 7.5 cm thick. These are dredged in a salt cure, which usually includes nitrates and sugar. The meat is left to cure briefly, only three or four hours, then rinsed, rubbed with a spice mixture containing Cayenne pepper and garlic, and hot-smoked until cooked through.   Grits weren't good either, but I'm past that now...   Fish and Chips...basically beer battered cod and curly fries...savior of the meal. Beautifully done piece of cod...flaky, flavorful and held it's texture nicely. Fried just right, not too airy, actually a little crisp with the batter...would agree w/ their menu assessment from Charlotte magazine saying it's the best...especially since they can't compare to Big Ben's anymore. Fries were like anywhere else's...at least the ketchup was salty.   I guess I was just shocked based on other experiences/reviews on Yelp.  Cheers!",

It's supposed to be thin, light, and crisp.  I loved the drink menu; lots of great wines, beers, ciders, etc. and at reasonable prices.  I am actually more intrigued by their soups and appetizers.  A really delicous looking salad came out while I was picking over my dough ball pillow crepe with ham tucked somewhere inside.  I brought my leftovers home and put them on the foreman grill and it tasted much better.  The ambience and decor is really dark and romantic; I think it would make a great first date location.  The irony is I just did not like the crepes...",

    "text": "The highs are really high and the lows are really disappointing at Crepe Cellar.  I haven't taken advantage of their range of beer and wine; this is probably bad, because judging by the urgency of the kitchen they're really hoping you'll take 20-30 minutes to drink something and not worry about how long your dishes will take to get to your table.  Pros: Very friendly waitstaff - every time I've been, each server was engaging and friendly. Specials creative enough to want to order.  The crepes themselves are excellent (as well as a good value), and the savory buckwheat crepes are surprisingly light.  The purple coleslaw, on its better days.  The desserts are great.  Cons: The kitchen is slow and underseasons each entree that I've had so far, including the beef stew, the crepe with spinach, goat cheese, shallots and chicken and a different crepe special.  This food can get bland.    When to go: For an early dinner before the crowds start to arrive, or with a date in the evening to split a dessert.  I want to love this place, but it can't happen until the kitchen is as disciplined with the rest of its savory offerings as it is with the crepes.",
