    "text": "Second-time customer. The first was a lot better. There was one guy working behind the line cooking. The cashier/waitress is everything that's wrong with the restaurant industry. She obviously did not want to be there, and that ruined my experience. Her depressed mood seemed to have taken this whole place down.   After she had taken my order, she went back where she was not found for another 20 minutes doing whatever. I've watched as multiple future customers walked in, and waited, then walked out as no service was granted. The cook kept going in the back to alert her, but she took her time. The cook had about four other meals completed and sitting on the counter until she returned to hand out everyone's order. It was an awkward experience.   Overall, food is very tasteful (she forgot to include the sauce, so I had to make due with just soy sauce, as I took mine to go.)  Beware that they may include MSG. It's always that feeling after eating hibachi style rice/chicken and feeling stuffed, then wait an hour and you're hungry all over again. Though I can not say for sure, this is just a guess. Don't expect to do much work or be productive after indulging in this meal, it will weigh you down.",

I walked in and the lady behind the counter greeted me and asked if I had questions. I asked her if I could substitute the sweet carrots for zucchini and onions, even offering to pay an upcharge. She told me that was not possible, although \"zucchini and onions\" is offered as a side for $1.95. I ordered the hibachi chicken and a house salad with shrimp sauce. They had several ladies working behind the counter on 2 registers, so they had to take turns ringing up orders. The food was alright, but they used an overwhelming amount of sesame seeds, which I've not ever had at any other hibachi place. I was also disappointed that everyone received their food in styrofoam \"to-go\" boxes even if they were dining in. That seems to be an incredible amount of waste. They also had all of their sauces in packets. Bottom line - for paying almost $10 for lunch, I was expecting nice diningware, soy sauce bottles at the table, etc. For the same amount of money, you're better off going to Hasaki. Sorry not sorry, Fuji.",

Their consistently subpar food combined with their increasingly poor service has nixed this from my lunch options as they are clearly never prepared to handle a lunch rush. After several lack of judgment return visits, today was my last straw. Already understaffed for the lunch rush with one cashier, it is no time to take back-to-back call in orders when the line is already to the door, preventing customers who are standing right there from getting in their orders. Maybe there was an underlying assumption that since we were in there, we were going to wait and complete our order. They were wrong. I and at least two other customers left to go somewhere else. While waiting in line, ordering came to a halt for at least four call in orders. The back-to-back ones sealed it.",

    "text": "Great location, right in the Epicenter... however the day I visited, there seemed to be some technical difficulties happening.  First of all, it was prime lunch hour time... walked in... and there was one person in the whole place.  I would think there would be a decent crowd (at least half the restaurant taken up)... but not the case.  The other issue was that there was smoke EVERYWHERE.  Maybe their vent fan was malfunctioning that day, but the front doors were thrown open and some floor fans were blowing the smoke out.... something tells me that it has happened in more than occasion if they have the perpetual floors fan blowing the smoke out the front doors.  Still determined to try this place out, I walked to the counter and order the hibachi chicken with mushrooms.  Pretty standard for all of these places.  Good to see it was cooked to order so I waited about 6-8 minutes... trying to decide if my eyes were watering from the smoke or from hunger... (mostly smoke).    The food was OK, but nothing to write home about.  Solid lunch option if they figure out their ventilation system.  The price did seem a little high for an okay hibachi lunch dish.    I do want to say that the employees were busting' their butts to get the food out.  The poor girl at the front was taking orders and delivering them out to people at the few tables that got occupied.  I may have started a trend that day when they saw someone enter into the smokey arena and still order food.  It was not for lack of trying.",

I placed my order for a hibachi chicken and they even let me sub broccoli for the carrots.   I was expecting it to take a good bit of time, but my food was ready relatively quickly. The portion is huge. Decent tasting chicken, broccoli, and rice. My only complaint about taste is their ginger sauce is alot more oil based then what I am used to (and what other hibachi places typically serve).  Overall, great quick lunch spot with good prices.

It's not fresh tea neither I saw the girl squeeze some milk tea looking thing off a bottle and mix with water and ice. ,I finish my tea and all the bubbles were stick together in between ice cubes. Totally not worth the $4",

    "text": "After giving Fuji three tries, I felt a review was deserved. Overall, everything I have tried has just been okay. The hibachi options are HUGE! I have tried a few different options, chicken being my least favorite as it was very dry. The shrimp has always been cooked well, as well as the steak. I will say, do not waste your money on the filet upgrade..I did not notice any difference from the regular steak option. Overall, my favorite is the shrimp, with the amazing shrimp sauce, onions and mushrooms as I find the carrots are a little too sweet. The fried rice is cooked perfectly and again is a large portion. Service has always been good, nothing great, so again Fuji in my mind is good, however, nothing I would crave & want all the time.",

Who would want to travel far for some late night cravings after a night of going out while at the Epicenter? Not most of us, so this is definitely a plus!   I absolutely loooooove loooove the decors here (props to them!). The ambience is so warm and welcoming when you first walk in, not to mention how modern and stylish it is! Their portions are HUGE compared to most places I've been to.  Wait...there isn't even that many quick hibachi places around here in Charlotte so to have a place like this got me excited. I used to go to a college town that has \"quick-fix craving\" hibachi grill restaurants all over town so when I came back to Charlotte, this city was definitely lacking that in this department.   As for foods, my favorite combo was the shrimp & scallops.  They are not itty bitty shrimps and scallops you see other places use in their meal. It was pretty decently sized. Thumbs up guys!   Oh! Don't forget to order their salmon salad as well if you want to stay lean. It's healthy, fresh and delicious! Good portion like I said. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Fuji is a fast food Asian joint in the Epicentre. Pick your protein, chicken, shrimp, tofu and it comes with fried rice and sauteed/steamed vegetables. Choose between teriyaki style or hibachi style. Don't expect any authentic Japanese food here. It's more akin to Asian food you can find in the mall at the food court. Or even like a Chinese take out joint. The staff was friendly. Service was prompt. I got the seafood combo hibachi style. Hibachi style has a soy based sauce. The teriyaki sauce has a sweeter sauce. That's the main difference. All platters also come with carrots and \"shrimp\" sauce, which to me is really just some kind of seasoned mayonnaise sauce. The seafood combo had shrimp, scallops, and imitation crab meat. I asked to get extra vegetables instead of rice. They do give good sized portions. I was quite full after finishing my meal. And for what I knew it was, it tasted pretty good. We also had the fried wings, which came out pretty juicy, and the vegetable dumplings, which I would pass on if I came back.",

I don't know what they bread their appetizer wings with but it's sent from heaven. They need NO sauce....but once you taste the spicy tangy sweet and savory Fuji sauce, it's OVER. I have got to figure out what's in that. My only critique is that they serve cooked carrots with their hibachi, rather than the usual onions and zucchini you may be used to. Still very good, but you do miss the tradition there. I would order this 4 nights a week if I could. Definitely a standby from now on.",

My coworker ordered chicken steak and shrimp hibachi which costed twice as much as mine but was the same amount of food. Poor chickens are on the bottom of the pecking order.... .....considering that everything is served in styrofoam, I would say Fuji is closer to a cheap takeout than even fast food dine-in!!!",

My friend and I were at the epicenter and I wanted some scallops and noodles. We ordered our food and I got rice instead of noodles. I politely went up to Simon and said hey I wanted noodles. Can you please swap out the rice for noodles? He said no. Shockingly I asked why. He said bc they already made my order. Well, it's the wrong order :-(. He proceeded to say that if I want noodles I can buy a side of noodles. I told him I wouldn't do that bc he got my order wrong and just his attitude toward me was completely unnecessary. So I told him that I'd like a refund for my meal and my friend will keep hers because her order was correct (mind you both orders were on my ticket). He proceeded to get loud with me and said that he will only give me half of what I paid for if I returned the meal. At this point I wasn't even sure what to say or do next. I politely walked away with my food bc I was not going to waste something I paid for and I damn sure wasn't going to let Simon Lee steal my peace and my joy. Basically BEWARE of this \"horrific made up Policy\" at Fuji Hibachi & Teriyaki Grill. They have no respect for customers, are not willing to work with you or own up to their mistakes and honestly this is NOT a restaurant that I would ever visit again due to their terrible customer service. Mr. Simon Lee, I hope you speak better to the women in your life and the customers that come into your establishment and management needs to coach you on your customer service skills.",

One of the cashiers asked what my order number was and then they realized someone had given my order away. I was clearly annoyed and so was my co-worker. The manager or owner, I'm not sure, did apologize, but clearly made excuses about how the order was given away. Of course that had absolutely nothing to do with me! He ordered my food be cooked again, but not once offered any kind of retribution or customer service for the fact that it had happened in the first place.
