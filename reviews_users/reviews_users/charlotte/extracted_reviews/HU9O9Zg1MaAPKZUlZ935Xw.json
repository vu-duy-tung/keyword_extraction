The wait is about 15-20 mins if you order at the counter during peak time, which honestly.... it's worth the wait. I typically order a Shake Shack burger & a milkshake but today I wanted to try the hot dog and I'm so glad I did. The hot dog is crunchy & the slaw has a spice to it that offsets the sweetness of the mustard. The fries are always awesome. They've managed to perfect the act of frying a thick cut French fry to a gorgeous golden brown, where it crunches in your mouth but still so soft in the center. I've also order the crispy chicken sandwich (I'm not a huge fan of chicken) but it was also delicious. My only feedback would be to be a little more efficient with pumping out orders. Seems a little all over the place (and I'm a very understanding person) & also more seating would be nice. The outside area is beautiful, (if you've been to the Blakeney Park shopping center you'll know) which is where I chose (well, was forced) to eat. Overall, this is a perfect lunch spot and there's plenty of parking options!",

One of my friends was passing through Charlotte so we decided to grab a quick bite to eat.  There was a small line but it moved extremely fast.  Almost every table inside and out was full but thankfully we found an open table for all four of us.  We got our condiments and then had a short wait for our food.  We all got burgers and fries.  They do give you a large portion of fries so you are able to share them between two people which is what my husband and I did. I got a burger with lettuce and tomato and it was absolutely delicious!  The crinkle fries were also SOOO good!  I was expecting not to love them but they were the perfect amount of crisp and potato!  I highly recommend going here, and I highly recommend you taking me with you!",

Not a good first impression at all.  Very dissatisfied with my hamburger, and I love hamburgers!!!  I am not sure if I will ever go back and that is too bad.

That part was good.  We were wondering how they stacked up to Five guys and as of right now they have nothing to worry about. I know it has only been a month or so but we waited 10 to 15 minutes for our food and sadly my burger was like warm at best. We will try them again as the weather warms and sit outside and try one of their milkshakes.",

It seems the new staff is still working to find their flow but all were pleasant and friendly.  A little more than disappointing was the \"hidden\" upcharge for whipped cream on the shakes.  We're already expending a little more than normal for a burger fries and shake so to upcharge the already $5+ shake by 50 cents was a bit ridiculous for my liking.  Glad we enjoyed our food but not likely making Shake Shack a frequent eatery on our list.",

They've had some \"just opened\" growing pains, along with lines outside the door on both of my visits. The food is spot on, great job of recreating that buttered bun magic here in Charlotte. As for the location, it's in Blakeney (despite indications of Ballantyne). And, during warm weather months it will be even more crowded as they've got outdoor seating and are adjacent to the Blakeney fountains.  Despite what others may have written, Shake Shack's arrival is bad news for the nearby Five Guys. Both are burger joints, with the Five Guys staff and local service lacking. Shack Shack's employees were cheery and helpful despite the fast paced customer action.  If you're looking for one thing to try on the menu, I've been loving the Shack Stack lately. That's a single patty with the 'shroom burger in one sandwich, delish!!",

As others have said yes Shake Shack is a chain and it is fast food somewhat, but service and consistency is the backbone of this company. Having visited a NYC location multiple times my family was excited when Shake Shack arrived in Charlotte. I have been a patron multiple times to the other location. We decided to grab a concrete on the way home since we have a location closer to home. We got it to go. I wish I had looked more closely as we got a half a serving compared to concretes served at the other locations.  Based on the other reviews and customers that expect different based on the reputation of Shake Shack it seems this location needs to step it up. Very disappointing and though I may give another chance for food if necessary I will drive to the other location to get what I pay for.",

Service was A-OK and they were quick to offer suggestions (I agree with previous reviewer that even a lame salad as a healthy option would be a good idea). Everything is FRIED. That said, I went whole hog on this trip and got the fried mushroom burger with cheese (& a burger patty). It was tasty, it was hot and yes, the fries were crispy & fresh. I'd say the competitor next door definitely wins the fry competition hands down - but I enjoyed the burger. Our \"mini\" (aka: child) really loved his meal - but he's clearly the perfect audience for this cuisine. Hubs said he definitely prefers shake shack burgers and agrees on fries. I suppose a loyalist could do the burger from one and fries from another.......... milkshakes are good (we got one) but it didn't hold the test of the drive home - was soupy and kinda lame by the time we got it home. (And who drinks the shake BEFORE the burger?!?). I wish them success but admit I miss the sit down options in Blakeney - too many fast casual options and not as many True family-style places that are affordable. (Love 131, but that's not quite the price point for families \"anytime\"). Hope this is helpful for others considering trying shake shack!",

The burger was tasty and fresh, however, I would have preferred a cheeseburger, but the only cheese option is American. Those of us who prefer anything else are out of luck. How difficult would it be to at least offer a cheddar alternative?  The fries are nothing special. They appear to be the krinkle cut variety found in your grocer's frozen food case. They were piping hot however.  The shake was delicious but no better than Steak n' Shake's or Burger 21's, and at $5?! C'mon man!   Service was adequate and the place was clean  yet somewhat sterile in atmosphere. Overall, my meal was good but with the plethora of comparable burger joints in Charlotte, this place just doesn't stand out.

The Chick'n Bites ($4.59 for 6 pieces, $6.59 for 10 pieces) are tiny and not very impressive either. Outdoor seating was nice though. A couple dog bowls are available for your furry friends.

The cool thing is, I ended up speaking to a store manager about my visit and they are welcoming me back to give them another try. They understood the situation and were sincere about making sure people are happy. Previously, I was not aware that they had only been opened for a month. They still have some kinks to work out. The manager knows they need to fix things to get off to a good start in Charlotte. There are lots of places to get a burger, competition is real. I'm sure after the employees get more experience, their ratings will be much better. I cant wait to give them another visit. I know the food is good, they just need to iron out some processes and personnel issues.",

We found the food solid and a strong competitor to Five Guys or Culver's.  The burgers were good and simple.  We loved the fries too.  My Hot Chicken sandwich was very good with the right amount of spice.  Our family of four enjoyed a meal of 3 fries, 3 burgers, and one Hot chicken sandwich. The final price was $48 (with drinks).  It was an ok value for the food.  They should do well in the area.  It's nice to have another alternative for burgers.",

I don't eat hamburgers in general very often and it has been at least 5 years since I've had a burger from a fast food joint, but when I bit into the burger I got - the SmokeShack - it reminded me vaguely of a Wendy's hamburger. The first few bites didn't have ShackSauce, but once I got to the part with the sauce, it made the burger a lot better. The burger was pretty good but way overpriced for what it was. Honestly with $15 for 2 single burgers and no sides, your money could be stretched a bit farther for a similar quality meal.",

    "text": "Wow the experience I had today was disgusting. My mother and I decided to come in for lunch today as I am nine months pregnant and craving a burger. We ordered two smokehouse burgers and a fry to share. We got our drinks and waited for our food patiently. When my mom came back with the burgers she noticed that one of them was missing bacon so she went back up to the counter and was handed a cup with bacon in it. Not ideal but it was fine. I then noticed that the burger that was missing bacon was also missing other toppings such as the cherry peppers the lettuce and the onions and sauce that were supposed to be on the burger. We ordered two of the same burger so it was a bit confusing why one burger was completely different from the other. I went back up to the counter where we went to get the cup of bacon and explained to the woman working that these burgers were supposed to be the same and they were not so if she could please reassemble the burger and add the correct toppings that would be very helpful. She looked at me as if I was asking for something outrageous rolled her eyes and took the tray and proceeded to speak loudly that I wanted my burger remade. While I waited my mom started eating the french fries because that's all we had from our order as they took the tray with both burgers on it away so I decided to go to the register to order another order of fries. While I was waiting for someone to come to the register I could overhear the girl from the window and other employees talking about me and not in a nice way. Claiming that they didn't know what I was wanting or what my problem was or why I was making such a big deal that I just Wanted a free burger. Let me reiterate what I said earlier the burger i ordered and paid for was not Not what I received so I asked for it to be fixed so that it was in fact what I ordered. I was not asking for a free burger and I was not making a huge deal of it I simply asked for my burger to be made correctly and if they could just put the toppings on it that would be fine. Another woman came from around the corner and told me that once the burger is assembled they can't take it back and I said that's fine but the burger I received is not what I ordered so I would just like a burger that I ordered and paid for I'm not understanding why it is such a big deal and I don't understand why your employees are speaking so loudly about me that I can Hear them on the floor. I did nothing wrong here except want what I ordered and paid for. Also I served tables for over 10 years and my husband currently owns a very popular burger restaurant in the area so the service industry is no stranger to me. I'm sorry if you made the burger wrong and don't want to remake it but I paid for a certain item and that is what I expect. After all this commotion I was completely turned off and no longer wanted my food or wanted to be in this establishment anymore as the employees are talking about me loud enough so I can hear them now calling me disgusting and I am being made to feel guilty as if I did something wrong when I just wanted what I paid for. I told the second woman don't bother remaking my food I don't want it. I don't even want to be in here anymore it was completely unprofessional and outrageous that this is happening and I can hear the employees complaining about having to remake my burger the correct way. As I was going to get my mother to leave a manager I assume comes to the table and asked verbatim \" are you the one having the issue?\"   I looked at him and I said excuse me do you mean am I the customer having the problem, am I the guest having an issue? yes I am. The lack of customer service coming from the manager asking me if I am the one? And not acknowledging me as a customer who paid for food or a guest in this restaurant was despicable. I left the restaurant at that moment because as I said earlier I am nine months pregnant and I was getting far too worked up over a burger that was not made correctly in the first place and all I wanted was the burger I paid for. Bottom line a burger was ordered and paid for and was not made correctly when asked to remake the burger the way it was supposed to be made we received terrible service from every part of that restaurant going from the people on the line to the manager on the floor. It doesn't matter what location you're in or who the customer is, we paid for something that we did not get and we were made to feel bad about it wanting to be fixed. The icing on top of the cake was the way that we were approached by the manager of this establishment.",

What I did have, the chicken sandwich and crinkle fries, was nothing I would ever get again.  Unfortunately, there was no grilled chicken and my chicken burger was very fried.  The crinkle fries could have been out of a frozen bag of fries.  John said his mushroom burger was like processed food with cheese in it.  Neither of us were impressed.  And, on top of it, the prices were rather steep, we thought. If I were 15 years old and liked regular burgers, this would be my place.  But, I am not that.  I wish they had some healthy alternatives.  Why can't they have one or two salads on the menu?   Why not a grilled chicken sandwich?   The atmosphere was lively, with a lot of teens.  I can check this off my list now, but really need to go back for the custard.   No more fried Shake Shack food for me.",

I hate to say this, and it will be the first time I've ever given any Shake Shack and I've visited at least 10 throughout the US anything less than 4 stars, but hopefully someone does something to fix it. First, we walk in at 8:30, no one in line and you can see at least 7 people cleaning the grills/friers etc, I ask and they confirm the close at ten...but immediately the cashier tells us they are out of everything except Shack burgers and chicken shacks. Really?? Seems like someone just wants to close up as early as possible and have everything clean and ready to close...we made the trip out so we got some burgers and walked over to five guys and got some fries. Unfortunately that wasn't all...the burgers were bad...they were burnt! Not the normal sear or amazing crust these burgers usually have but a bitter burnt grease taste...just bad. Luckily Fiveguys was still fully operational and we were able to get ourselves some burgers...please someone fix this!! Shake Shack is so much better than this.  I been waiting a looong time. Finally got a Shake Shack in Charlotte, now a second?? Officially not moving from Charlotte anytime soon! I get it for the price you can get a bigger burger at Bad Daddy's or even at 5 guys, but the meat in these burgers is just amazing. Pat LaFreida beef is on another level, that and a Martins potato bun and you barely have to chew. Fries are good, but you don't come here for fries you come for the burgers and the concretes and they do these 2 things better than anyone.",
