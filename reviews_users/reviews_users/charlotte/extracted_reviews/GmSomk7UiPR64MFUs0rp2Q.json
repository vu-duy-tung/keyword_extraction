    "text": "We have been in Charlotte for a year now.  In January I decided I needed to lose weight and work on my health.  My husband and I started going to Blackfinn most Thursday nights because I wanted salmon on our night out.   I found their salmon was perfect!  We always sat at the bar so my husband could watch the TV's, and our bartender Mikey took extra care of us.  I ordered my salmon with no sauce, no butter, just as plain as they could make it to hold down calories.  I found it needed no extra seasoning.  The salmon was excellent......always flakey, always delicious, just perfect.  The broccoli I ordered as my side with no butter was always tasty and steamed just right.  Only one time was my order not as I asked for it, and Mikey went back to the chef and made it right.  I am sad to say that we are leaving Charlotte, and I'm not sure if I can ever find a restaurant that can make my salmon as flakey as this without any added seasoning.  I am happy to say I am down 70 pounds, and wow have I enjoyed eating my Thursday night salmon at Blackfinn.  Kudos to a great bartender Mikey and the chef!",

The rest of the dining space (downstairs) looked like it was an old 90's Perkins.  Food wise, we had three in our party and each ordered something different:    1) 14oz Ribeye w/garlic butter for side had the greens and mashed potatoes. Overall wasn't bad - green are close to traditional.    2.) Stirfry - vegetables are okay, could have used some heat in the sauce though. Overall the dish was just ok.    3.) pork carnitas - basic food, pork wasn't really tender. Overall - okay.    Two people ordered drinks, a rum and coke and a Long Island ice tea and both drinks had two much ice in them and were watered down.   The menu feels disjointed from the decor. Overall impression is that the place has no real identity, won't be back again.",

This place is A-OK I mean its just a really reliable go to place for food and drinks. They have 2 levels with a bar on each floor. I always end up upstairs for some reason though. They are a little pricey nothing to bad but while I always leave satisfied I'm not like itching to come back asap. I do like that they have a lot of tvs that make it an obvious choice for any sporting event that might be happening. The bartenders are ok they don't say much to you and you may need to flag them down should you need something.   The food has always been good here I have to say. The other night I had the steakhouse salad the bleu cheese was outstanding and the steak was a decent cut. My guy had a turkey burger which was really good not a huge portion though which I actually prefer but he was still hungry after the man could eat all day long and not be full. They have patio seating on the first floor and parking available in the epicenter parking deck and is located in the front entrance to the epicenter.",

I liked the atmosphere, everyone in their own conversations and several sports games playing on the tv screens as \"background\" noise. It was relaxing. I forgot our waitress's name, but she was very friendly and assured me that my meal choice was a smart decision. I ordered the shrimp and grits (labeled on menu as a restaurant specialty). I really enjoyed it, it had a different look than your typical shrimp and grits. There was a creamy sauce surrounding the shrimp, grits and sausage. The only negative thing I would say is that the blackened shrimp was a bit too salty for me. Aside from that it was great. I would come back, if I ever come back to Charlotte.",

The entree I got was meh. I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf. To me it didn't have any flavor even though you can tell they put the most in it. It was like bland sausage pizza lol. But hey, you cant eat everyone's meatloaf. The green beans were yummy.   I got dessert too. I think it's called the brownie chocolate chip avalanche? It was okay.   Maybe it wasn't a good idea to order the meatloaf. I'll come back and try something else",

We were sitting at a table outside and asked the manager if he could please ask the people that were congregating behind us to move over a little bit so that our chairs didn't get slammed every time a waiter would need to get by.  The response I got was \"it's just the nature of the pub crawl\".  Absolutely unacceptable response by the manager of the restaurant.  About a half an hour later there was, of course, a problem with the people behind us and they eventually got kicked out when they wouldn't get out of the way of the waitress who was trying to serve the other tables around us. I understand the place was busy but when I ask a manager to help us make it a little more enjoyable I would expect a little satisfaction.  All we wanted was him to ask the people behind us to move over a little bit and clear the aisle. After all was done, the bouncer and the waitress thanked us for helping them keep the aisle clear.",

And the fact that it's one of the very first places I've been to right after moving to Charlotte makes me feel a bit attached to it.  I don't go there often, but everytime I'm there, I enjoy it very much. The food is nice, the service is super, and it's vibrant but not tooooo loud up or down stairs.  All in all, I'd recommend it, especially because it's right there in Epicentre. Go try it.

We were going to ask if one of the tvs could be switched to Nascar but she wasn't around. When we finished our drink she finally came back around and asked us if we wanted another.

You don't expect too much flavor when you order a pasta and it was a pleasant surprise.The portions were generous and everyone in our team loved the food. Few of my colleagues ordered Shrimp, Steaks, New York Strip etc and they really liked what was served.   A male-server was a little rude to me, when I requested him to take a picture of our group, and it took one star away from this review.

The other night, a few friends and I were hanging around Epicenter and one friend suggested Blackfinn for a drink. My intuition responded with a loud \"No,\" since the last few times I've been there, the crowd has been weird and the vibe was off. Admittedly, it's been many months so I thought, maybe I can try it again.  When we walked in, it wasn't as suffocatingly crowded as it is on weekend nights, but there was still a weird vibe and I felt a little bit uncomfortable in this place. The bartender was curt and seemed like he had a bad day or didn't want to be working there. One friend ordered water and the bartender rolled his eyes.   One thing I appreciated was that the menu has all prices listed clearly. Still, our bill for three drinks was surprisingly high - and we are uptown regulars. If we at least got a friendly smile, it might not be so bad.   I know the business cannot control who walks in the front doors, but it's always a consistent situation where other patrons make me feel uncomfortable here. One other individual at the bar was so overtly staring at me (I'm not dressed in any weird or slutty way) that my boyfriend had to shift his chair so as to block his view. As this patron left, he walked so close to my chair as to brush the length of my hair. There was plenty of space for him to walk by without doing that...   The location will ensure that this business has an audience - I will not be included in it.",

I certainly don't want to relive that time in my life but it's so tempting at the same time!   This is definitely a fun, upbeat, young bar. I went with a bunch of friends and all we did was dance all night long. The music was great, the dj was great and he played a nice variety of music for everyone to enjoy. It definitely was crowded and definitely was filled with the college scene, which if you don't enjoy, I wouldn't venture out here late night during the weekends. It's a fun environment but you have to have the tolerance!   Drinks were relatively cheap for uptown in the epicenter. I'm sure I'll make my way back here one night when I'm feeling 18 again and party like it won't hurt the next day!",

Their bar bites/appetizers are delicious ... I'm a fan of their chicken tenders. For dinner, the shrimp tacos are tasty, but nothing extraordinary. They have a great patio area to enjoy the warmer months.  This place is packed at night, and is a definite 'hot spot' in Epicenter for drinks. It's pretty average priced for Uptown.",

The booths all have personal televisions attached (very cool).  Our waitress was absolutely amazing, I wish I could've gotten her name.  I ordered a Long Island iced tea and so did my brother. Our drinks looked completely different. Mine was clear I actually thought she was giving me another glass of water. My brothers drink had the faint brown color. Both tasted disgusting. The waitress said it was because the bartender used lemonade and that she could make it again. I declined and instead asked for a drink nobody could mess up. Or so I thought. I ordered a margarita and so did my friend. Mine looked like a margarita however it was terrible it tasted like soap. My friend's margarita came out next and hers was clear and tasted like salt water. We all sent our drinks back. The waitress kept apologizing even though it was not her fault that they have a terrible bartender. I ended up just getting a lemonade which she completely voided from the bill. I thought that was very nice of her.  I gave this place 4 stars because the food was great. For dinner I had the iron skillet macaroni and cheese with blackened chicken. It was VERY tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. Everyone at my able enjoyed their food.   I'd definitely come back just to try another item off of their extensive menu, but i think I'm done ordering alcoholic drinks from this place. Hire a new bartender please!!!",

Thank goodness we had dressing on the side. If they had to make new salads we would still be there. The waiter never checked on us and we had to flag down another waitress to get our check.

    "text": "Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 3.75 Stars  Always a solid lunch spot, today I ordered the Double Bacon, Double Cheddar cheese burger and it was (surprisingly) REALLY good! I don't know why, but I expected an average burger! Duh....out of all the times I've been here the food has always been solid (but not spectacular). So today I decided to \"take the plunge\" and order the burger....I've had MANY of the other lunch menu items, and have never been disappointed....but for SOME strange odd reason today I thought differently.....thankfully, my worst fears were slain and I had a REALLY good burger!  So my experience here in Charloote is that when you order a burger \"medium,\" you get well done. That's just how it normally is here in town. So that is what I expected. BUT, much to my (very pleasant) surprise, I got a very MEDIUM burger today! YEAY! It was slightly red in the middle and Paul was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy! Very juicy and tasty all in one bite! And since I got a \"bacon\" burger, I asked for my bacon (extra crispy and well done) and they DELIVERED! Yeah #2!  Finally, the fries. Wow they were really GOOD! They must have been taught at Johnson and Wales University (where I learned to make great fries) because their fries were VERY tasty......crunchy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. VERY yummy!  The 2 guys I met at lunch were very \"friendly\" with our lovely waitress.......and shey took it like a seasoned Pro....even though she was young and \"no match\" for my work crowd!  Overall, a really great place to have a lunch!",

Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship.",

When we got there the bar was packed so we understood that there could some waiting time to get drinks and the cover was only $5 so that was not a problem. The problem was when we got to the bar the bartender served about 5 people who got there after me which was about a 20 minute wait on 1 drink. Once I am able to ask for Hennessy and Coke she makes me a Hennessy and red bull. She tells me the price of the red bull drink, $13, and I alert her that I didn't want that and she makes the new drink. I ask her what's the price on the new drink and she then tells me the price is $13.  In my mind I'm thinking there's no way the those two drinks are the same price but I pay for it and walk away. I head down stairs to the restaurant area where there's a little more light and I notice that I have a filthy sticky glass. I then go ask the bartender in the restaurant area how much a Hennessy and Coke is and they tell $11. My intuitions were correct. I was up-charged $2 for my drinks on top of being given a dirty glass. After that fiasco we left and ended up having a good time at Suite, but I would not recommend blackfinn to anyone.",

Around $30 with 2 soft drinks; in and out with plenty of time for the theater.  Service was average.",

I'm so glad there weren't any tables available at Fleming's because we  were very happy with our meal. My husband loves iceberg lettuce wedge salad and Blackfinn's was huge. He got tons of bacon and really good bleu cheese dressing. In fact, he didn't want an entree because he enjoyed the salad so much. I had a slightly dry Caesar salad with dressing that tasted good, but needed more dressing. My medium-well ribeye was tasty, but needed a little more moisture. It was supposed to have a butter drizzle, but it needed more. The bacon cheese grit cakes were the star of the show. They were crunchy on the outside and really moist and delicious on the inside. We didn't need dessert because we were very full. Thanks for being there for us, Blackfinn! We'll be back.",

    "text": "This place used to be decent. And the bare bones and the TV action upstairs and downstairs is excellent. However management has missed the boat in general. Here's why. They are obsessed with playing music instead of volume for big games. Why on football Sunday only play sound for the Panthers.? After their game is over why not put on the volume for another game? It's a sports bar. The ACC tournament is in town all week with a fun local vibe and the policy is \"maybe we will do volume!\" Incredible. Huge difference with sound for games on. Otherwise the place feels like a morgue half the time with some odd music playing. Take a look around and look at everyone staring at the televisions and understand why they're in there. Why do you think in the summer at 2 PM there's no one in the bar? That's because generally there's no sports on guys! If people want to go to a club there are plenty of options around uptown. I've asked before and the answer is \"well it depends and we might put on the sound if enough people asked for it. \" there are two problems with this. I want to know the situation before I actually go to a sports bar and want to trust what's going to happen so I plan in advance. And they also don't understand that most people want the volume on but don't have the guts or want to bother to actually ask for it. Quite frankly they shouldn't have to. Also if anyone is interested I have a ton of positive reviews on Google. So that's not what this is about. The bottom line is me along with a lot of other people I know in Charlotte just simply don't go to the bar anymore. It's a shame.",

It is a sports bar and it has plenty of tv's and they are very nice about putting on the game you want to watch.  The booths in the bar area also have small, individual tv's in them as well!  As far as sports bars go, I'd say that Blackfinn has some of the best food available.  Definitely not your standard chicken wings and nachos.    The cheese sticks are mozzarella in spring roll wrappers with an asian-style dipping sauce...a great twist on this appetizer.  The baked haddock is really good and I would definitely get it again.  The crab cakes are good too, although I might ask for them to be a little more crispy the next time.  If you're looking for sports with better than standard food options...check out Blackfinn!!!",

Food: We started with the Finn fries, queso, and soft pretzels. The fries were nicely seasoned and came with buttermilk ranch and bbq ketchup. The other two apps were ok. I ordered the lime seared salmon as me main meal. It had a great crust to it. The only thing I didn't like about it was it was a little to salty. Other than that, it was cooked really well and was a nice portion size.   Service: A little slow and not super friendly, but not bad either. Our waitress was quick to bring out drinks and refill our water glasses, which is always nice.   The have a really extensive menu with tons of options ranging from healthier (salads, fish, chicken) to more decadent options (burgers, pulled pork, etc) at a good price point.

I did a pick two meal where I got a buffalo chicken flatbread and house salad. The food took a while to come out. Other times I've been here, it also seemed a little slow for food. The house salad was fresh with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes,  onion, pine nuts, parmesan and kalamata olives. I got what the waitress described as a green goddess dressing. It had a creamy garlic flavor and was pretty good. By the time I got to my flatbread it was a little cool. It had a nice buffalo and blue cheese flavor. I could have used additional hot sauce.

There was no apologies, no compensation.  Being from San Francisco a REAL city, I've never dealt with anything along the lines of this at a restaurant. Same goes with my coworker who's from Chicago.   We will never be coming back, and we will make sure to advise everyone we can to stay FAR away!",

I have also tried the blackened chicken pasta which is a rich but tasty dish.",

All was fine until we got the bill and was charged for the extra garlic bread.  wtf.  What I thought was a nice gesture, because I joked with the guy that I stole my wife's piece, turned into an additional charge.  So, five stars to three and likely won't be back to try other menu items which is a bummer.",

They allowed myself and the 3 others who were with me that night to return for another shot.   We were greeted with kindness and attentiveness. Our waitress was again very kind, personable, and hard working. We ordered drinks for the table, which came out very quickly. The cocktails were very good, and you could tell they were made with quality ingredients. I enjoyed both bourbon cocktails on the menu. The guys got a beer tower haha.   We put in an order for two appetizers- the pretzels and the spinach artichoke dip. These also came out very quickly. They deep fry the pitas for the dip, which instantly makes them to die for. Pretzels were decent.   I ordered the salmon with rice and green beans along with a Caesar salad for my entree. The salmon was a good portion and the Caesar salad was well balanced and delicious.   Lastly, we ordered dessert. The chocolate chip brownie with ice cream was to die for. It may have been my favorite part of the meal. It was nice and warm and the ice cream was the perfect topping. It was plenty big to share! Everyone enjoyed it.   BlackFinn took care of the entire meal for us as an apology for our previous experience. I even had two family members come into town last minute, and I asked if they could join. They took care of all 6 of us beautifully and welcomed us with open arms. They handled the situation with tact. These are good people, and I was pleased and excited to return. We enjoyed it!",

She mentioned how inside the bar area smelled rancid as if someone had projectile vomited across the entire room. I thought she meant just a dirty ol bar mat. NOPE.. Ohh dear lawd! Horrific smell as I entered the bar heading to the restroom. How are people actually sitting in here eating right now?   Because of the horrific odor, and still opting to eat here, we chose to sit out at the front patio area and absorb second hand cigar smoke instead. The waitress laughed when I made a joke, but other than looked as if she really didn't want to be there. Actually, a lot of the employees looked like they would rather be somewhere other than BlackFinn.  We had questioned how many tacos came in a meal, she stated 2 or 3. We opted for two but she insisted on ordering us three. Huh. Interesting. Listening is a skill. We also ordered the spicy shrimp app. Before those came out, we were greeted with a pimento cheese app compliments of the folks previously sitting at our table that decided to relocate.. and that message wasn't passed down the pipeline.  Cheer up the employees and rid the vomit odors and more stars could be coming your way.",

I'm very glad that they acted responsibly as I was very perturbed and boiled when this occurred. I honestly felt robbed initially and thought that they might as well have asked me for cash donations if they were going to deceive me.  Anyhow, Hopefully this was isolated event and misunderstanding as they say that they will be educating waiters about these events. I will change my 1 star rating to 4 as the food was good/fresh and tasty, location is excellent and given the care and concern they have shown me for the situation.  ------- (Prior post:)  So.. supposedly \"won\" free happy hour for me and unlimited friends. (See attached photo for proof and the wording! ) Per email, complementary light bites. I planned for 10-12 friends although they said no limit. They didn't have any food initially and friends said staff seemed confused. I arrived and had to inquire about the food. She says yes appetizers platters will be served. I let her know up front I have 10 person party and repeatedly asked if several plates would be coming out and she says yes.   Then they bring the platters so slowly I have to inquire about the next platter.  Then I get the check and they charging $20 per platter. She then says only one was Included for free- but I told her why didn't you tell me only one from the start??   She purposefully deceived which I don't appreciate. And how is it \"invite all your friends\" when the platter only included like 6 items- are some people supposed to share a chicken wing?? Ridiculous!   I'm not a cheap person by any means. I just don't like sketchy things. Waste of my time and if this is Blackfinn's way to promote their business then great I'm never coming back. Btw we all bought plenty of drinks etc. very slimy.",

    "text": "This is kind of long so a quick summary if you don't want to read it all... Go somewhere else..  Service was really bad and food only average.. definitely not worth the wait.   Four of us had reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday night.  We were greeted by the host and he was super friendly and nice.  He seated us so we could see the UNC/Duke game projected on the wall.   Thus ends the good experience.   The four of us ordered different things.  I had a chicken pasta dish one of us just had a salad and another quesadillas..  The food was equivalent to a TGIF or Applebee's. What really made this a negative experience was the service and our waiter, Braxton.  It started off with us overhearing him arguing with someone that we weren't his table and didn't want it... but unfortunately for us... he got it. It took a long time to get drinks and we finally ordered an appetizer. I don't even remember what we ordered, but it took about 25 min to get.. and I know this because we ordered right before halftime and we got it a few minutes into the second half.  What topped it off was after about 20 min, during which we never saw him, we stopped him and asked if the appetizers were coming out soon... he didn't even stop and said \"I guess they should be\"   He never brought drink refills... I had to get up and take to glasses to get water.  Then finally we had to stop him again.. to order a dessert.   Service to us was very slow..  several other tables of 4 came in after and were gone before we ordered dessert.  I don't know what his issue was with us or if he just took it out on us that he didn't want the table. Here is my recommendation-  Go anywhere else!!  There are tons of restaurants in Charlotte... give them a try!  There is no reason to accept average or below food and HORRIBLE waiter service.  I just cant explain how bad an experience Braxton gave us...  we all said it had been years since we had experienced something that bad.",

It has a pub feel and I have always know it as a drinking hole. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese and it was so good. Also the service was really pleasant as we had a very nice server. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great sandwich for lunch Or even dinner.",

This is the perfect go to for a relaxed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday: 3-7 pm).  The crowd wasn't overwhelming, but the wait staff seemed short-handed.  It was a Wednesday night, so there was Trivia contests.  We won the first round and our prize was a free beer!   The food was delicious.  I was impressed that they have several items to choose from on the Happy Hour menu, and if you can't decide you can order all five for $20!  I liked the Bama chicken sliders the best.  However, everything I sampled was equally good.  I will definitely return for Wednesday night trivia shenanigans!",

I could understand if it was busy, but there was maybe 10 people in the entire establishment.  This was during pride in Charlotte, which we were in town for.  On top of that, they never checked in to tell us about the wait.  Now we sat down, ordered our appetizer and entree, literally said to the bartender we were starving and it didn't need to coursed, the food could come as soon as it was made.  Then two people sat down after us, and received their food before us.  Clearly, the bartender forgot, at least the appetizer should have been taken off the bill, and their should have been an apology.  Literally no one mentioned the wait, then no one checked in about how the food was, when it finally came.  Just a very poor experience from an establishment that I like, the food and service is normally good( never great).  Overall, very disappointing experience, I may come back but may not.  I wouldn't recommend it, and I'm not going to make an effort to go back.",

Service was ok, food was about average (I got the bacon wrapped meatloaf - dry and only got a tiny amount of ketchup - really?). Was afraid to ask for more, as we got charged $2.50 for some simple seltzer water from the bar - my wife orders the carbonated bar water often since she doesn't drink, and rarely is there a charge, much as much as $2.50! Also the food portions were small for what your paying, she was not impressed and neither was I ! We received the check before we got a chance to ask for dessert (we weren't even asked). Don't recommend - walked away feeling this establishment nickel and dimed us (get us in/out as quick as possible), as well as chintzy with condiments and bar water.

We ordered the cauliflower tots, the chicken tacos and chicken sliders, from the late night menu and enjoyed each dish! Unfortunately, dessert was not included in the menu and I was really hoping for something sweet to cap off a wonderful evening and the start to my birthday. As Zach passed our table, I explained to him that it would be my birthday in about 20 minutes and asked if any exception could be made for getting dessert. He said, \"let me see what I can do\" and when we finished eating, we were presented with a delicious brownie a la mode and he even joined in singing happy birthday, which was above and beyond my expectations. Zach made our experience very special and he is a wonderful manager!!",

The cocktail I had was the cucumber cooler which sounded good on paper but really just tasted like a watery gin and tonic. :/ We ordered a bunch of apps (wings, nachos, etc) , all of which were pretty standard. For my entree I had the fish tacos, which were pretty mediocre as well.   The upside is that the menu is very extensive so there are alot of options!! The food was okay, but with soo many great dining options in Charlotte, I won't be returning (at least not by choice)",

I ordered the shrimp and crab dip and it was awesome. Most places you order something like that, and it ends up being a little crab and a ton of cheese. Not the case here. Big chunks of crab and shrimp, and still plenty of cheese but not overwhelming. It was nice outside yesterday, so we went to their downstairs patio and had a few beers outside after we had paid upstairs. Would definitely go back to check out more of their menu.

Off this menu, I ordered the Buffalo Wedge Salad and it was fantastic. Not the healthiest salad I've had - with buffalo chicken tenders - but certainly worth the calories. My coworkers ordered tacos and sliders, and both enjoyed their meals. The absolute best thing I ate were their French fries! I'm not exactly sure what it is, but there is an extra breading that makes them crunchier than normal. The texture and the taste were both great.  Their menu has a good selection of healthy choices as well as guilty-pleasure choices. They've also got a nice beer selection. Our server was fantastic and gave us recommendations that we all enjoyed.  If you haven't been here for lunch, give it a shot! You won't regret it.",

Blackfinn has such a fantastic  VARIETY of offerings I could not decide between starting my first meal with a classic burger/ fish and chips or try their unique watermelon and tuna poke dish or the bbq salmon salad. My captain started us off with the blue crab and cheese dip with fresh kettle chips (which I wanted to inhale but forced myself to savor, slowly!)  I ended up choosing a comfort-food style bacon-wrapped meatloaf slider which had fresh and crisp cole slaw and lots of grilled onions to which I requested a side of the jalapeno beer cheese to try! We ended up dipping ALL of the remaining potato chips in the cheese (of course it tasted great on everything) and Captain enjoyed the bbq pulled pork mac and cheese which was bursting with flavor! I seriously cannot wait to come back here every time I'm in Charlotte and try everything!!! Our lovely waitress Paige was super helpful, sweet and fun. This place is cool, comfy and delectable. Oh my captain was also obsessed with our personal in-booth flatscreen where we cracked up watching Chive TV while we grubbed. Cheers!",

    "text": "My God, what astonishing food. This ain't pub food, this is so much more. My visit tonight was a couple of days after an event at the same restaurant, I really wanted to see an \"organic\" run of dinner service, out of the critical spotlight.  Krissy and I got seated right away. After getting our drinks, we saw some things on the menu quickly and just placed apps and entrees at the same time. Food service was very fast. I wish the appetizer had come out before the entree but everything was brought all at the same time. No biggie, that is how we ordered it!  Chipotle Queso was outstanding. They're adding a new Jalapeno Pale Ale queso to the menu soon so I wanted to give this one a try. Good base, velvety texture, and just a hint of heat. It was a tad on the salty side but this is quintessential bar fare so no problem at all. Huge fan of this.  Krissy got the ginger tuna entree and the best part of her tagging along is stealing bites! The tuna, oh wow. I'm usually a purist when it comes to tuna because it's so easy to overwhelm the delicate flavors, but they showed a lot of discipline with the ginger and overall seasoning. The sear, phenomenal. I'm actually arguing about which was better, the tuna or the green beans served alongside it. Lightly seasoned Tuna beside cranked up garlic green beans, match made in heaven.  My steak and frites was a big home run as well. Perfect medium-rare skirt steak, thinly sliced, and seasoned with salt/pepper/garlic, simple as can be. Spot on execution and served with arugula and fries. Is it crazy for me to think of greens next to a steak typically as an afterthought? Blackfinn proved me wrong tonight as the vinaigrette tossed on top cut the fattiness of the steak so well, they have an eye for balance. Outstanding fries, hot, rich, and crispy!  With all that praise, praise, and more praise, it's a shame that the visit was soured slightly by our waiter. Between ordering, 15min wait, food coming out, and eating all but the last few bites, there was no sign of him. I had actually saved 4-5 bites of my steak waiting on a refill because I was very thirsty. It wasn't that we couldn't flag him down, he simply wasn't anywhere to be found. The wait staff station was right beside our table so I was dumbfounded as to what happened. I really wanted to order a Birdsong Jalapeno pale ale to go with my meal and my girlfriend a glass of wine, but no dice. By the time the refills came out we were finished with our plates. The check came shortly after and that was about it.  Such a shame, the food was perfect. Chad and Matt are doing a phenomenal job in the back of house. I just found myself envious of all the neighboring tables getting better service. If the food made this review 6-stars, the service unfortunately lost it 2! Really bummed on being the bearer of such news but hopefully next time I'll be able to give it that final star! Hell, as long as the food is as good I'll be back no matter what.",

I've been here a few times, with the latest visit during dinner.  The ambience is best described as folks in suits who have been loosened by half a dozen beers.  For dinner, I had the fried chicken, which came with roasted potatoes and collard greens.  To me, the best part was the greens.  I love the bitterness with a dash of spice.  They had the perfect consistency, which take a lot of time in the pot.  I enjoyed the potatoes as well; they also had the right level of doneness.  Lastly, the fried chicken was decent. I just didn't enjoy the heavy gravy that went on top of it.  It was heavy and overpowered the chicken.  I couldn't really scrape it off since it had softened the breading on the chicken to the point that it all would've fallen off had I tried.  Service was friendly, and the waitress remembered to asked me if I wanted sweetened or unsweetened when I ordered iced tea.  It's something I always forget to indicate when I'm in the south, so I'm glad she made sure!  3.5 stars for the food, rounded up to 4 for the service.",

I was part of a large group so they gave us a smaller menu to choose from; not the full menu.  I had used yelp and checked the menu online so I knew what i wanted before i walked in (mac and cheese with BBQ pork) but it wasn't on the small menu they gave us.  So I ordered what i wanted \"off menu\" - kind of and everything was fine.  The waitress checked in to make sure i liked it.  FYI the mac and cheese w/ BBQ pork is really good.  The service was fast, the drinks were cold.  good times.",

It may be one of the best pieces of haddock I've ever had! Fresh and cooked perfectly. I always sit at the bar and the bartenders downstairs are outstanding! Very friendly & engaging! I also come back because of Ishmail. He is one of the best bartenders in Charlotte! So respectful, remembers your name, shakes your hand! There's also another male bartender (tall, white) that is awesome also! If they could get the rest of the  bartenders to carry themselves like these 2 guys do, they'd \"hit a home run!\" I realize upstairs is different at night (rushed, busier and more like a club), but the lack of smiles and coldness of some of those bartenders (many are females), can be nasty!",

    "text": "I must start by saying I am basing this review on the food and service of an event held in the top floor of Blackfinn where they provided a variety of catered food options; however, I did not dine in the restaurant by ordering off the menu. In my experience with the food we received, however, everything was mediocre at best. The good: the service was friendly and they were good about refilling drinks; their salad and fruit selections were very fresh (when salad is the best part of the meal it's generally not great news) The bad: pretzels and cheese dip- the pretzels were supposed to be soft pretzels but were way too dense and chewy, not very good at all. Tacos (they provided pulled pork and fish tacos)- neither taco came with much meat at all, the guacamole on the side was very bland, and everything as a whole lacked flavor. Chicken sandwich sliders- I had two of these..the first one had less than an ounce of chicken (literally took up 1/4 of the slider bun at most) and the second was very bland, unseasoned chicken that was way overcooked.  All of the food was very bland tasting and lacked any spice/sauce to provide much flavor. They also overcooked most of the meats it seemed, and everyone was complaining of things being way too dry. Normally I wouldn't write a negative review without actually ordering my own personal meal at the restaurant, but I have a guess from the quality of the catered food that everything here is average at best.",

He said yes and preceded to tell me that they had $2 corona lights and $4 draft beers (not to mention he used his fingers to tell me the amount they would cost, so there was no miscommunication in pricing).  I figured the $2 corona light deal was a good special so I ordered to.  When I asked for my check (they already had my card so they paid it out) my total was $11.  I asked the bartender why it was $11.00 when the other gentleman told me they were $2.  The gentleman who told me the special returned and rudely told me that he said $3 (even though he definitely told me $2, besides it does not add up to $11).  I then asked to speak to the manager and wanted to pay the price I was told. The manager told me there was nothing he could do except buy me a beer.  He preceded to pour me a beer without touching a register (a beer I doubt he comped off, therefore stealing from the bar that he is managing. Definitely not sketchy at all)! I found their customer service dismal. I will never return.  They lie and steal your money!",

    "text": "This was the biggest letdown I've experienced in a very long time from a restaurant. I attended a graduation luncheon with 22 guests & a set # of options for guests. The reservation was at 1pm. All guests were seated by 1:13. We did not have dedicated servers, so we wound up having to walk behind the bar to get ice & refill our tea, water, and lemonade. Yes, that's how lacking the service was. We only got caught getting our own ice once during the 3 hours we were there. It took a guest tracking down waitstaff to take our order, get the drink pitchers refilled, etc. The food took so long to get to the table that when one of the guests went to find a server, another guest went to another restaurant & brought takeout back to share. The manager Chad/Chaz finally came by and said that when the server put the order in it never made it to the kitchen, which is why it was taking well over an hour to get to us. The restaurant wasn't busy, so I'm still wondering why the kitchen staff wasn't wondering where the order for the big table was (especially since the party was reserved well in advance). A few guests got the fish & chips. They remarked that the fish was good, but the batter was so greasy that they removed the crust (which was shiny & hard). They said that you could actually taste the oil from the fryer. One little girl ordered the burger & fries. She destroyed it & said it was the best burger she'd ever had (not sure if it was or if she was just that hungry). The mother of the graduate got a chicken wrap & fries with a side of hair (yes hair). The step father got the lemon chicken, which he said was good (but he'd never seen a recipe for rice pilaf with little bits of angel hair pasta in it). I ordered the crab cake sliders. They were decent but had a fishy flavor to them. There continued to be a lack of service & I almost felt bad for the manager on duty. He was sweating profusely every time he came to apologize for something else. The first set of cake plates they brought actually had chunks of food on them. And some of the rolled utensils had food on them. The glass with my iced tea had food on the outside of the glass as well. The manager said he'd make it right before the bill was brought. They brought out a platter of cookie brownie bites. The strawberries that garnished the platter were gorgeous! However, the flying insects that came with the platter kind of sealed the deal with my disgust. By the time I left the restaurant I wasn't feeling well. I barely made it home before I got sick & spent the rest of my evening near the bathroom. I don't feel much better this morning & yes, I spoke to the manager last night so he could check the crabmeat. But this was a horrible experience. I had a much higher expectation from the appearance. The food, health standards, and service wasn't even marginal. I realize we were there  a long time. But it was mostly spent waiting/looking for service. And for all of the issues with the luncheon, the manager only took off a whopping 15%. Yes, epic fail Blackfinn. Your staff needs training in the BOH & FOH.",

We found a spot at the upstairs bar, and had to wait just a few extra minutes to get a drink ordered.  It was generally longer than I'd like to wait to be served, but considering the timing right before a 20,000 person event, it was reasonable.  Our bartender was fine - not rude but not especially friendly.  Beer and martini were good.  Ordered fried deviled eggs and fried chicken sliders to eat.  The eggs were pretty disappointing.  They were fried to perfection, but very bland.  I love a deviled egg, but these lacked lustre for sure.  The fried chicken sliders were fantastic.  Very fresh and tasty.  The food did take FOREVER to come out - like maybe an hour.  Again, we should expect some service delays during a hyper-busy time, but this was pretty bad.  I would probably give this place another try on a night with no event if we lived nearby.",

    "text": "We did a work lunch here with about 20 people. This was the first time I'd been here, the place was pretty busy but thankfully we had a reservation.  The service was better that I'd expect for 1 server for 20 people, plus with the rest of the place being packed. The food did take a while to come out but that was pretty much expected with the volume of folks in the restaurant. I always had water in my glass so I was good while waiting.  Someone from the table ordered some chips and dip. I wasn't really in the mood for chips and dip but figured I would at least try one. I immediately regretted that decision. The chip was soggy/greasy and there was absolutely no life to it to give it that \"crunch\". It tasted chewy like it'd been sitting in a pool of grease before being dumped on the plate. Gross.  I ordered the lunch fish tacos. By reading the menu and being told by a friend these were supposed to be good, I was expecting some really good tacos. You basically get 2 tacos and some rice for $11. You can get them fried or grilled and I ordered the grilled ones. When the food finally arrived I was very disappointed by the portion of fish in the tacos and the overall flavor. I know both tacos combined couldn't have added up to even half of a filet. The person across from me even made a comment when the food was delivered, \"Oh wow you are eating very light today, huh?\". The very small bits of fish were piled on a huge bed of cabbage. When I took a bite I literally tasted nothing but cabbage and since the fish was so small only the 1 or 2 inner bites of the taco had any fish. No avocado or cilantro flavor made it through the overwhelming cabbage. The side of rice had a good flavor but I didn't order the meal for the rice, I was really hoping for some tasty tacos and man what a let down. I felt like I just payed $11 for a mouthful of cabbage. What a rip off.  I'm not sure if I would try this place again. Maybe dinner would fare better, but I'm reluctant to try when there are so many other restaurants in the area with better selections.  I would rate lower but the server was good and handled the large crowd very well.",

    "text": "I see from the reviews are all over the place.  For a while I liked this place but now I've soured on it and don't know if I'll be going back. First introduced to this place via Meetups and initially I liked the vibe.  It typically does attract a good crowd on the weekend nights.  Bartenders work incredibly hard when they're slammed and deserve credit for that. When I started to go bad on Blackfinn was when I started to venture here on my own upon moving to Uptown and coming during times when they weren't slammed.  I started trying some of the food and while not terrible it wasn't much to write home about.  You pay a premium for eating at the Epicenter which is why as a general rule you're better grabbing a bite outside the Epicenter whenever you can. Also, and I know Blackfinn isn't the only place guility of this, but when they're not as busy the bartenders start getting a bit lazy.  A lot of time talking amongst themselves, on their phones or talking a lot with one customer (a lot meaning over 5 minutes with one customer or group of customers).  What this is that despite not being busy you're getting slow service.  You sometimes feel its easier to get a drink when the place is packed because there aren't distractions.  So yes I gave credit where credit is due but criticism of the customer service is warranted her.  The bar staff need to seriously up their game. Oh and one bartender was a total d-bag to me after I was trying to joke around a little but we won't go into that one.   Not saying I would never go back but unlikely I would go back by myself.  It's just not a single friendly environment.",

Not to mention the bartender with the fancy watch couldn't have seemed more bothered to serve us when he had maybe 3 tabs currently running and no tables in his section. He threw the shots at me and my friends from across the bar. Paid over $24 for 3 shots. Go upstairs to Howl at the moon to get a STRONG bucket for only $3 more and much better service.",

Much less a smile.  Did not greet me when I sat. 2. Squeezed 3 lime slices into my drink and got 2 drips.  DRY is not the word!  3. Ordered 1 drink...sat for an hour and was not offered another drink. 4. Second bartender came on and did not say hello or offer any help. 5. Staff all gathered talking but no one attending to my party or other guests.    Plain and simple...bad service.",

It was filling, looked great, tastes great. I like the art in there and they also brought the projection screens down in the main dining room. Also the booths are Large. Price was also good! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is our server was slow. But I'm sure it will be different next time",

    "text": "It took a minute to get greeted and seated.  Once we sat our server asked us what we would like to drink.  I asked about the whiskey selection, she said she had no idea and sent me to the bar.  The bartender really wasn't well versed in her stock because after she was done I had to point out the top shelf whiskies.  The bartender poured the drinks, several minutes later our server dropped the drinks off and left.  Ten minutes later she came back over and took our orders.   My husband ordered a Greek salad and an Apple Bourbon Glazed Catch of the Day.  I ordered French Onion Soup and the Balboa.  Our salad and soup came out first ( which we requested).  My husband's salad was fine but my soup was cold, the cheese was not melted and it had a funny taste.  After our server passed us a couple of times and after several minutes of it sitting at the end of the table she finally inquired how everything was.  I told her it was cold and tasted funny - she apologized.  A few minutes later our food came out - my husband's food was fine but again my sandwich was ice cold.  At this point I was so hungry I just ate it.  When she finally came over and asked how it was I was almost done.  While I was in the middle of explaining - she walked away - SHE WALKED AWAY while I was mid sentence.  Granted it was to get the manager but she walked away - rude.   The manager Jeremy came over and he did apologize for the food being cold - he said which I can only hope was joke that the kitchen staff was hung over because of the holiday.   What I didn't say to him - which I should of - if the server spent as much time taking care of her guests then hanging out the bar with him, the other servers and staff maybe our experience would not been so poor.   The manager did comp both the soup and sandwich which was totally unexpected and we were grateful but we still will not return in the future.",

I thought the food was ok (very basic and a tad bland), but they didn't seem interested in keeping the very limited buffet items stocked (or even plates). We sat outside and I think had a server come by once in the 2 hours we were there - had to go inside to the bar for everything (water, coffee, etc.) Also, I thought it was weird that it was a dog-themed event, yet there weren't any water bowls/stations on the patio for the pups.",
