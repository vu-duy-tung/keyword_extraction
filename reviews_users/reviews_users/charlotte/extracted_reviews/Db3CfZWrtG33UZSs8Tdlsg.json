It is a good sign that it was busy.  I had an arepa and my wife had a quinoa bowl.  The flavors for both were excellent.  We also got chips to try out the various salsas.  The green monster and pineapple/habanero were outstanding.  Lunch for two was about $20 and was plenty of food.  We ended up with half of the quinoa bowl to go.  Sabor lived up to the hype and we can't wait to go back and try more of the food.  It was a great lunch.",

My friend and I went on a whim and the employee was very helpful in helping me make a decision that wouldnt undo everything I did at the gym next door (lol).    I ordered what I think was called the Avocado and quinoa bowl.  I didn't quite know what to expect, but it was delicious.  I ended up saving some for home, and they were more than happy to provide take home boxes.  I didnt realize before I went that they had beer (on Sundays domestic beers are $1.50) so I will have to make another trip to take advantage of their specials. :)",

I had never ventured to a Sabor before, so at a girlfriend's suggestion to try the new one that opened at the front of her neighborhood, I finally got to taste the delicious.    Newly opened, fresh and bright in a strip mall, on Father's Day at an odd time, we had the place to ourselves.  The gentleman at the register was super helpful, as staring at all of the menu options is a bit overwhelming.  We split a large queso.  The dip is a bit thinner than I prefer, but it was well flavored and the chips that were served with it (warm chips - yum) held up well to the dipping.  It was also good poured over the chicken taco americanos that I ordered.  The chicken was well seasoned and juicy, served with fresh lettuce and cheese (hold the tomatoes for me), served on a lightly grilled tortilla.  The tofu/quinoa bowl that my girlfriend got was HUGE and she said was delicious.  I could not believe all of the tofu and avocado in the bowl, it looked amazing.    I can't wait to go back and try more!",

I am assuming because of the combination of lunch time and Taco Tuesday (tacos are $1.00).  My order was ready when I arrived so I did not have to wait.  I was very happy with my order.  I ordered the Epic Protein Bowl with shredded chicken and I added shredded cheese and guacamole. It was very tasty and very filling.  It was a large portion of food. I ate half for lunch and had the other half for dinner. The only thing I would do differently next time is to either get it without black beans or at least less.  There were plenty of black beans in the dish.  I do like black beans okay but less would have suited my taste better.  Not in any way saying they were bad just a personal opinion that I would have liked to have less.  On the next visit, I will make that request.  So as you see I will be visiting again especially for lunch because it is close by and the food is tasty.  The staff working there were very friendly despite how busy they were.",

We had a chicken Arepas, the elote, grilled chicken taco, chorizo empanada (it was huge), shredded chicken taco, side of Guac and cheese dip. Everything was delicious, but the cheese dip was the star of the show. It's better than anything that you can get from any of the local Mexican places around here (forget Don Pedro!).  There is a $1 taco special on Tuesday, but the line was to the door yesterday evening. Better believe that we will be back.... Many times.",

So last weekend when I was looking for a takeout spot I decided it was high time I go. I feel like you can never go wrong with nachos so that's what I went for, I especially love places that let you basically build your own. Therefore I got some Barbados nachos and a large side of Queso. Nachos can be a hard thing to travel home with, but these held nicely. There was a good amount of toppings and meat but not so much it overtook the chips and left them a soggy mess. I asked for jalapenos in the Queso and they took that in the extreme and they were hot peppers just very pickled. Wasn't a big enough deal for me not to thoroughly enjoy my food or to keep me from going back! I could see this fast becoming my go to place!",

Both were amazing! The fries were topped with fresh steak, guacamole, queso, pico de gallo, sour cream &  delicious cotija cheese! I'm not usually a fan of guacamole not made in-home, but I loved it here! The Paloma had a lovely citrus fizz which is refreshing after practically inhaling the fries lol.   On the second visit, I purchased the sweet plantains and the Mucho Sabor Margarita in honor of International Tequila Day. Again, I was not disappointed!   I could eat their sweet plantains every day of the week.   During both visits, the staff was welcoming and informative, and the restaurant was inviting and clean. I will definitely be visiting again!",

I noticed that there was only one employee in the restaurant and wondered how he'd be able to handle the phone, register, customer's and cooking. I thought there was no way he could be by himself at lunch. I assumed help was on the way or somewhere in the back. It took 20 minutes to put my order in as the employee was taking orders over the phone, and cooking them immediately afterwards. When I ordered he was overwhelmed and wasn't polite. I asked for a margarita and a burrito and my brother ordered the same.   The burrito took 20 more minutes to make it to us. The burrito had zero meat! I'm assuming in his rush he forgot to add it. While he was cooking I could see him dropping several things and was cursing out loud.   The standard set by other locations is already pretty high. I was critical of the other Sabor on Hawthorne but they got their act together and have become a favorite spot of mine.   The margarita showed up way toooo strong. No salt or sugar on the rim. I had to water it down several times. The total bill was $36.... this isn't a cheap lunch for 2.   Was disappointed in the entire experience and being a Steele creek native it's easy to see why many restaurants fail there.   Terrible.",

Switching to more Caribbean fare, the   empanadas are sizable, with tasty fried pastry and generously full of meat, chorizo, or your preferred ingredient; they are delicious and especially so with real hot sauce, and they have a range of great sauces from mild through perfect. At this point they have soft drinks only but are supposed to have craft beers and Latin cocktails available soon. I give it the highest marks for the fresh, quality ingredients, generous amounts, perfect seasoning, friendly service, and the ease of ordering online and building your order in advance. I want this place to do well - it is a great addition to the limited offerings in this area, and I will be a regular!",

I had a couple of their Tacos which were very good. The chips and cheese dip also good. One of the best things is the Salsa bar which has a bunch of unique Salsa's you can try. They have a small selection of beer, and they have Margeritas!. I didn't try those as I was eating lunch here with my daughters, but its a nice touch. Overall, the food was pretty good, and I've been here 3 times already, so it must be a decent place! Fast casual Mexican, you aren't likely to beat this in the area.",

The menu has a solid selection to choose from. I had the fish tacos on flour tortillas, great choice! The 3 Amigos Burrito is also delicious. ITS ATOMIC! I received a free side order of chips just for checking in on Yelp! The location offers a varied selection of sauces for chips and for addition to your entree.  Very good food. If \"Sabor\" translates into \"flavor\" then this restaurant is aptly named!",

I thought they come on the side, but they put them inside. That was annoying. Once again, the Al Pastor pork was on the dry side. But the churros, omg the churros were delicious I! I didn't know they were filled with anything until I bit into it. They were crispy and warm with cinnamon sugar and what I believe to be dolce de Leche. Food is cheap and good, not great.

Simply put - this place knows definitely knows how to do Mexican food right! I've tried many things here but my favorites hands down are the tacos and empanadas. The tacos are simple and filling and just done right! I've tried the chicken and the steak both very well-seasoned and juicy!  And the empanadas are HUGE and delicious. They are always served up fresh with the most delicious salsa rosada that I've ever had. I love them! I have to get one every single time I visit! And let's not forget the salsa bar! So many different options to choose from it's perfect with the warm seasoned chips!   And did I mention they serve margaritas. Geesh. How could you not love this place! I can't wait to come back!",

I was so hung up on all the questions on what goes in the highly customizable taco salad that I totally forgot to order chips and guacamole. I will have to try them at a later visit. Though I didn't try the chips I would say this is a great location for them since they have a salsa bar! While we waited for our food I investigated the salsa bar and brought a couple samples back figuring I could chip away at my taco salad shell and it would basically be the same as chips.  Our food didn't take very long and when we went to grab it tragedy struck. The food is served on large round metal trays and my boyfriend leaned over to put my taco salad down and the taco salad kept going. All the way to stick a face down landing on the booth seat. Tragedy for such a young taco salad to die untasted.  Upon hearing of our misfortune the girl at the counter found the order and had the cooks remake it for free. It was ready in less time than it took me to split my boyfriend's empanada with him. I was so impressed not only that they refused to let us pay for a replacement but also the speed at which the replacement was provided.  The empanada was delicious, the steak in the taco salad well-seasoned though overall the taco salad could have used a little more flavor. However that could be intentional because I customized the taste by adding my selections from the salsa bar. Taco shell bits worked well as chip substitutes and we both left completely stuffed.   We will definitely be back!",

The man at the counter was super friendly and helpful, answering all of my questions. I think he was the manager.  I wasn't sure exactly what some of the food was, so he asked me what I liked and made suggestions. My husband ordered two Americanos tacos with ground beef. They were large. Had a large order of queso with chips. The chips were seasoned and warm. Both were delicious. I ordered a fish taco and an empanada with shredded chicken. They were out of empanadas, so the manager suggested and arepa instead. It was delicious! The sweet tea is good, but VERY sweet. I'm Southern, so I could handle it. They also have a great selection of alcoholic beverages. Can't wait to go back on a Friday or Saturday night and have a margarita with my meal. All the food was fresh and I thought it was a decent amount of food for the money spent. I even took home leftovers. I had read some bad reviews on Yelp and wanted to experience it for myself. So glad I did!",

I wish they would improve is having someone busting the tables more often.. most of the staffs are more behind the kitchen so that leave the dining area and the tables a grand mess.

Because that seem like it all it is out here!  This Sabor location is a small place that offers Latin street food.. very straight forward. No mixed drinks. Many cans and bottles beers. Both local and imports. The fish taco was delicious. I devoured it before I can take a pic. Their corn on the cob with cheese?, sprinkle with some chili was on the sweet side. Didn't expect that!! But love it! The empanada that I ordered was supposed to be beef but I got chicken instead.. was also good. Fried nicely, very nice crust to it.. and lastly the sweet plantains. Boy do I love.. the sweetness is heavenly. And it has a nice burnt crust around the outside.. very savory at the same time. I would like to try the other location too. Maybe they can give me a good mojitos??  After I posted the review. Personnel contacted me to say YES THERES MIXED DRINKS!!! Yes!!!! Yayyyy!! MUST Try!!",

I got a steak quesadilla for my daughter, and two shrimp tacos plus an arepa for myself.  We took our order to go, and it smelled so good it was difficult not to open the bag and sneak a bite (which she did) on the way home. I was happy with the tacos- it wouldn't topple Paco's tacos to me, but I enjoyed every morsel. My daughter enjoyed her steak with extra meat.  What stood out to me? Definitely the arepa. After eating both tacos, I couldn't finish it until later but it was delicious. I gave my daughter a bite and she ran off with it. Next trip I'll get an arepa plus something else on the menu.  Great job Sabor.",

I went with three tacos - one chicken, one carne asada and the third al pastor. They took a few minutes to be prepared and then it was time to dig in. Nice \"autenticos\" plating with chopped onions and chopped cilantro. Everything tasted super fresh. The beef was nice and rich tasting, the pork and chicken had a nice roasted flavor.  Be really careful with the salsa bar. It goes from very warm at the left to insane at the right. I am not kidding.",

When I see things like that, I start to basically look for other things to complain about (because it is so basic that a salsa bar is disgusting). So I'll leave the bad there. On the bright side, the burrito was nice size and filled w veggies (veggie burrito). The empanada was delicious, but like I said the price is ridiculous.

One chicken arepa is enough for a meal for me (especially if I'm sharing chips, although I sometimes also get a taco because why not). The arepa is a crispy shell that is filled with chicken, cheese, and a sauce. Prepare for it to get messy, but you won't be mad about it. I also recommend the tacos, empanadas, queso, and guacamole. A basket of chips is perfect to share.   This location is in a strip mall. It's  not fancy, but it's reliable good service and great food. I recommend Sabor to everyone.",

So once again delivery saves the pallet and today it was once again from UberEats. Thank you for your service.   The (beef) taco was soft and savory. The flavors mesh so well in the perfectly cooked (not hard, not dry) (shredded chicken w/ cheese) empanada, the churro was not too sweet and had a filling of caramel- just so good. City of Charlotte you are great.",

It's huge so you can definitely get two meals out of it. Their fried plantains are also amazing. Very sweet and delicious. I've also had their nachos, carne asada fries, and the quinoa avocado bowl. All of them are delicious. The nachos are served on a serving tray and are enough to feed at least three people.   The food is cheap for the amount you get and the quality. They also have a salsa bar that is complementary which is pretty nice. The downside is that you have to pay for chips.   If you're looking for some amazing, cheap Latin American food, this is your place!",

I had skipped breakfast and it was around 11:30am so my friends brought me here for a delicious lunch.   Fro the Taco menu I ordered Autenticos with steak and added black beans. They also come with onion, cilantro and lime wedges. Since each taco comes with 2 soft shells and a ton of meat and beans I made my 2 taco's into 4. This was a perfect portion and filled me up without becoming stuffed before hitting the road for 5 hours.   The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was also very very fresh. I'm looking forward to coming back on my next visit to Charlotte.",

    "text": "I'm really not sure where I've been the past decade or so, I guess living under a rock. Sabor Latin Street Grill has 8 locations throughout Charlotte and I'm just now getting to one. I don't get around to Steele Creek often, but when I do I have a new delicious taco joint to go to!  Staff is warm and patient. Great, small crew who are cranking out amazing food. The cashier, manager, and I small-talked about the state of Charlotte while I waited on the food and it was clear to me that they were very connected with the local culture, big plus for me! The menu was very enticing but I had decided on tacos before I even arrived. They have 3 styles so I decided to try one of each style with a different protein on each:  Authenticos with Tilapia: Corn tortilla with cilantro, onion, lime, and the fish. This was the most expensive as it upped the price by $2. Oddly enough it was my least favorite. It's not that I hated it, just wasn't my thing, Tilapia didn't vibe with me! Corn tortilla was good and savory though.  Americanos Al Pastor: Flour Tortilla with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and pork. This was the best for me. I could sit down and eat a barrel of these. I'm certain it was pork but you could have fooled me and told me it was prime ribeye.. delicious moist pork that had a great texture and a bold marinade. The whole taco was so fresh!  Locos Barbacoa: Corn Tortilla with sausage, salsa, cabbage, cilantro, lime, and the barbacoa. Very good, tender barbacoa with a savory tomato-like sauce/marinade. A lot going on all at once but definitely a winner.  Another great part of Sabor is their yellow tortilla chips are made in house and they are fantastic. Well seasoned with such a wholesome, full flavor. Warm from the fryer when they serve it to you and they have a full salsa bar ranging from whimpy to chipotle habanero. Somewhere in between there is pineapple habanero and this was great in small amounts, still spicy but not crazy!  Although this is way out of my typical Charlotte footprint, I'm glad I dropped in. With 8 locations I'm going to bring the office to one and get fat on the pork... more please!!",

From the time I walked in, I was greeted by the cashier. He was super sweet and helpful when I became indecisive about what I wanted for lunch (I was good with Elote Locos and drink... but apparently protein is important). It took all of 7 minutes for me to receive my order and be out the door during lunch, which in my book is an epic win!   They offer weekly specials, but can be missed if you're only looking straight ahead at the menu or may not have checked their website beforehand. Having a small reminder for customers to look to their left for specials is the only small suggestion, that I would have.   Nonetheless, this place will see me a lot more often!",

Taco Tuesday is always good, and I love the myriad of salsas that you can try.  Moreover, there's so many healthy options-- such as the Quinoa Avocado Bowl, or the Epic Protein Bowl.  I'm a huge fan of BYOB, Build your own bowl/burrito when I go there just so I can always customize my experience.  The service has always been excellent whenever I go, and when I have tried something new-- such as the Arepa, the staff has been patient and kind as I talk with them about what they like or don't like, and how I might appreciate that item or not.  It is a quiet, casual spot to eat, and you can get what you want fairly quickly if you're in a rush without sacrificing quality.",

Beef taco tepid.  Other beef taco =cold.  Chicken tacos are all ice cold.  Colleague said just microwave them. I decided then let me follow up with the owner that reached out.

No flavor and on top of that the meat was cold. The burrito also had grilled steak. I took 2 bites and threw it away. The beef empanda and the cheese dip was the only okay thing I had. I spent 30 bucks and I would never go back to that place again. Also the cashier and 'cook' notice I didnt eat the food and didnt even ask what was wrong. Bad service. Bad food.",

Some good sauce in too but I recommend adding some pico de gallo. Get the combo with tortilla chips and fountain drink for about $3 more. I ordered small queso and pico which were both very fresh and delicious. The pico should be part of the complimentary salsa bar but it isn't so you need to order it. Hubby custom made a rice bowl with grilled chicken, black beans, jalapenos and Mexican rice. It was so good but I would've added sour cream to make even better. This place is fairly fast and very affordable. Plus, it is yummy and seems healthy so go get you some!",

The only downside I've found about all of the locations is the lack of seating. During the lunch rush the line was out the door, and all of the seats were full. In addition, their biggest tables probably only hold four people. It's not really a place I'd take a group to sit down and hang out because of that.",

I ordered an empanada thinking it was going to be average size like the ones I cook at home. The empanada was big, and under filled. Lots of pastry, not very beefy. The burrito was gigantic, not sure why I ordered a burrito, I didn't even eat the \"she'll\" just ate the meat and etc from out of it. If they keep up the great reputation this place I know will be around for a long time. When I went through in today the owner was even in there stocking the fridge, and he even took my order! I'm sure a lot of people in my area would be more than thrilled if they offered delivery. Something to think about in the future? Doesn't seem like people had an issue driving though as I did the same. It's always good to be part of the wave and try things new and exciting.  I look forward to sampling new other item off the menu that may appease my taste buds..",

The location in Steele Creek is small but in a shopping center that has tons of parking. I have been twice now for takeout. I think the manager has taken my order both times. He is very personable and makes sure he gets the order right. My food has always been ready to go in 10 minutes or less which is the perfect wait time. I have ordered a variety of tacos, all good. They have a salsa bar with a variety of salsas. Plenty of to go cups which is nice. The salsas have been low or out on both occasions. Disappointing but ironically on both occasions, another takeout customer had already asked for them to refill, so I have been able to get what I wanted. On one occasion, I saw the nachos and OMG, I am going back for those when I have time to eat in. The place has been busy on both stops, so I hope that is a good sign.
