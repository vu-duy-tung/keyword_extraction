It's okay go ahead and do your happy dance. I know I did!   Order the Smothered Fries! Don't even think about passing these up. They are worth every bite. Not to mention they use REAL bacon, load them up with cheese and give you a side of ranch dressing for dipping. Shut up. So good.   Am I a fan?! Of course!",

I had already eaten dinner, so I didn't need any of their overpriced food.  After I drank my one beer we left.  Outside of pint nights, I just don't think this place is for me.",

The guy told us it would be 25-30 minutes and we ended up getting a table in about 15 minutes. The service was super slow and the food took forever to come out. I don't know if that was the hunger talking, but it literally felt like we've been sitting there forever. I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and I really enjoyed the pineapple chunks in the tacos and in the salsa. The chips that came with the taco were so salty that salt would fall and stick to my fingers. My tacos needed more seasoning because it was pretty bland. We also witnessed a couple sitting there for quite sometime without a single person coming by to even ask what they wanted to drink. The couple angrily stood up and left in a hurry. They left so fast that the lady left her purse in the restaurant. That's not okay! I honestly don't know if I'll be back.",

    "text": "I stumbled across this gem on accident when trying to find a place to grab a bite, but not being from the area. Good Lord was I happy to find this place and its 150 beers on tap. My friend and I were literally amazed by the wall of beer choices and the even larger number of TVs. (I straight up asked the waiter how many there were.) Regardless, we were given the drink menu-which was an iPad- that had not only the regular choices, but also any type of mix you could imagine. Then there was the food menu, pretty much anything that you may crave while drinking. Flatbreads, tacos, cheesecake, you name it. We ordered and waited only about 15 min for the food, which tasted pretty good. I recommend the flatbread over my wrap but hey, both were satisfying. The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars was the wait staff. They were pretty unhappy to be there. I've worked in food & bev and no one wants a boring waiter.  Nonetheless, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to grab a drink. It can hold just a few people or large parties..not to mention there is a different TV and beer for everyone!!",

We ordered the nachos with chili to split between the four of us. The portion size is obscene. Also obscene was how much of it we ate. Someone joked that Duckworths must put crack in it because we couldn't stop eating it. Addictively good.   For my entree I ordered a new menu item: margherita chicken with balsamic reduction (grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, caramelized onions, basil, and balsamic). The dough was perfectly crisped and I'm glad I veered from my normal red sauce pizza.   For dessert, we split a pumpkin cake. If I didn't feel sick from the gluttony, I would've eaten the whole thing. It tasted like the best of a carrot cake and apple spice cake. Cream cheese frosting.   (I can't believe we ate that much.)  Duckworths has a big selection of craft beer and I was happy to order my new favorite: Hop Drop and Roll.   We are definitely going back. I hope soon. More nachos, please.",

You go here, for those items, and then depending on the quality of service and the execution of the kitchen, you have a good experience or not so good experience.   We arrived around 6:30, and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. ok, not so bad. Then within 5 minutes, they seated us. We walked by 4 empty tables on the way to our seat. Not sure why the host was so far off on the seating wait time, but things were looking up. The waiter was nice and knowledgeable. I ordered a beer flight (which HT doesn't have). We order potato skins as an appetizer. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Our waiter came back through twice and asked if we were ready to order our dinner, and we kept telling him, after the appetizer arrives, we'll order our food. On his third visit, I told him, I don't believe the appetizer is actually ever going to arrive, so let's order the food. After about 30 minutes, the appetizer finally arrived, and it was good. Real potatoes, not the frozen kind. The food arrived relatively quickly, but without our side order of fries. We waited, waited, waited. I told the waiter, you forgot the fries. We had finished the entree. we waited. And finally, the fries arrived.  The food here was good. The beer selection excellent. It was crowded. The execution on our order was poor. Not a lot of parking. Its very similar feel and menu to Hickory Tavern, with a 2x better beer selection.",

As a side note, the place was barely a quarter full at this time so there should be no excuse for slow service. The first issue we encountered was waiting 30 minutes, yes you read that right, for our beers. Our waiter quickly brought them to the table after complaining as to where they were. Besides the incredibly slow service, which seems to have reputation around that establishment, the worst part of the night was encountering Alyssa, the store manager. She was by far the rudest manager I've ever \"met\". Besides comping one of our dinners they messed up, which still took an hour to serve, she had the audacity to raise her tone of voice and talk back to us when telling her about the poor service we received that night. I rarely write reviews but because the way we were treated by Alyssa and the poor service, I felt inclined to let other's know to avoid that spot. Between slow service and awful, AWFUL customer service from the staff, especially Alyssa, we will no longer eat at that establishment and would recommend others to find a better place to eat instead.",

I'd heard that the beer selection was quite good and was not disappointed in that regard.  They featured a nice sampling of local, regional and national craft beers both on draft and in bottle.  And best of all it was $3 dollar Tuesday.  The menu is extensive and the four of us ordered different items, ranging from a sandwich to a salad to an entree.  The portion sizes were large and represented a good value for the money.  Good was tasty and nicely prepared and all at the table enjoyed the meal.

Servers are usually very friendly, but if they're slammed, don't expect fast service. In my opinion the food is worth the wait. I've tried fried pickles at many different restaurants around Charlotte, but theirs are still my favorite. I also love their pizza. I usually get pepperoni and add fresh basil. My mom always gets the fajitas...and I always have to grab some of the chicken. Such great flavors in those fajitas!!",

The food is SUPER average and the only thing that happens consistently here is that the service is horrible. Last nights server decided it was more important to hang out in the bar and flirt with coworkers than it was to come and take our order. Food arrived, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. No buffalo sauce to be found and when I asked the server about it his reply was \"it's a buffalo chicken wrap for sure but there just isn't much buffalo sauce\". So instead of fixing it, he went back to the bar to hang out with coworkers. And if anyone ever tells you that their BBQ is good, they're lying. We orders the BBQ and it came out looking like mushy slop. And it tasted a little suspect. I'm pretty sure that it was frozen and then thawed and served. Completely bush league. The only reason that I have this place even 1 star was because of the beer selection. On a contrast, the location in Ballantyne does a great job! But this place? Stay away",

Our server (I think it was Brian), was helpful in selecting delicious beers and brought out samples as needed by our very large (and even louder) group. We only ate appetizers and pizzas, but they came out relatively quickly given how busy the place was and were awfully good. Their fajita nachos are big enough for about 7 people, but sadly don't have as much chicken as some other local places. They're darn good though. The prices seemed pretty reasonable for the portion sizes. The only downfall is that the beer list is a little confusing. Not very well organized, so it's helpful to have a server who knows beer and can lead you in the right direction ( or offer free samples so you can make sure you're getting what you want!)",

    "text": "After driving place after place last night trying to find something good we decided on Duckworths.  We get there walk in the manager is on the phone having a personal phone call.  I asked should we seat ourselves or what because it had been about 3 minutes or so and she had not so much as acknowledged us.  Then she pulls the phone away from her head and asks one of the servers to please seat us.  He asks us where we preferred to sit and we ended up picking the dark booth.  He explained the options and specials and tells us about the specials.  Not sure what his name was but he was super nice.  Looking at the menus we see that alot has changed here.  I didn't know this until reading some other reviews but they relaunched recently and changed a lot of stuff.  Our server came and told us that yes they are testing new concepts for the chain.  I ended up getting a burger with sweet potato fries and it was pretty good except I received the burger well instead of medium like I requested since they asked.  My friend's got a order of sweet potato fries.  The honey mustard was not that great it had to much zest we asked about that and were told they use a Dijon in it which is why it was that way.  Me on the other hand got ranch with my fries and it was pretty  good.  While we were eating the manager walked by our table and again couldn't be bothered to acknowledge anyone.  It's bad customer service when you act like that.  If it was me I'd definitely be checking in with guests to make sure they are having a good experience.  I don't know if I'm really wanting to give them another go because I felt like I got ripped off honestly.  Almost $30 bucks for a burger, fries and draft on special.  What was sad is they pretty much have the same amount of fries in the side that they gave on the appetizer. I'm a fan of the metal plates though. I think I liked the old Duckworths better.  Please check your female manager she was pretty rude during the whole visit.",

The draft list was a bit overwhelming to read since it was in an excel spreadsheet on a piece of paper and tiny to read. I will have to say that there were a lot of higher gravity options which I prefer not to have while enjoying a longer game so I went with an Allagash White with an orange slice.   For food, we started out with the Buffalo Bleu Cheese Chips which were great. For my meal, I decided to go with the Gorgonzola and Apple Flatbread with a side salad while Boyfriend ordered the Cobb Salad. Food was decent, nothing to write home about.   My one complaint was when we were leaving the hostess kept asking us multiple questions about how our visit was. I thought that a simple, have a great day and thank you for coming would do.",

They have a small lot that they share with Starbucks and the Relax the back store and the space are super tight so the chance is that you're going to be crammed up against a land yacht or someone who does not know how to park.  In my past few visits here, I've noticed other things that made me lower my rating of this place. The food is very average - either overspiced or just bland, there is no happy medium. And the beer selection, while they have a lot of beers on tap, the variety isn't what it used to be. On my most recent visit they only had 4 local beers on tap. Really? What a shame.  And service has been hit or miss. There used to be a female bartender here who was outstanding but not sure if she is still there. The two guys I had in my recent visit seemed to be more interested in shooting the BS with each other than assisting customers at the bar.  Sorry Duckworth's, I would expect more from your original location, but lately I just feel I get better food/service/beer selection elsewhere.",

This neighborhood grill sports a full menu including salads, pizza, steaks, and yes, Philly cheesesteak.  Dora here. Check out that super sweet patio. And we were impressed with the interior. Clean and fresh, not like some pubs that smell like the night before.  For my lunch, I chose the Steak Fajitas served over a bed of sauteed peppers and onions. I chose not to include the beans or rice and opted for a side salad. The fajitas were great. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium with a tender texture. The peppers and onions had just enough crunch, the way I like them, not like a lot of fajitas with overcooked and mushy veggies.  Dora here. Yeah, yeah, I know that people eat with their eyes first and this plate doesn't score points for presentation, but that sirloin was so tender I actually cut it with a butter knife. So maybe I need an update on my eyeglass prescription. lol.  Good thing service was quick and efficient because I drooled over this photo the whole time we waited. I could definitely sink my teeth into this goodie. Didn't tempt hubby, though. Does it do anything for you?  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

We didn't order any appetizers but what they had sounded good and the pricing was reasonable (for example:4.99 for fried pickles) I ordered the supreme Philly cheesesteak with fries. It was so good! The fries also reminded me of penn station fries (fresh cut and deepfried). My boyfriend ordered the taproom burger and he was pleased!! He is one of those men picky about his burgers and he definitely approved this one!! He devoured it quickly.   We were originally gonna go to shake shack or whatever it's called but I'm so happy we made the last minute choice of coming to duckworths instead. Great food and beer selection!

This place has quite the selection of craft beers on tap, I was amazed at the variety of local beers on draft. We tried some wings and they were incredible good. The pizza was just good but it hit the spot. My buddy's kid ordered a kiddie dish of wings with the sweet bbq sauce and it was a little to spicy for the kid and I was extremely impressed at how one of the staff could tell by observing that something wasn't cool and he came over and asked. He had no problems bringing a new order of wings for the child. Throughout our meal the service was probably some of the best service I have experienced in a long time even for the place being completely packed.   Be careful though trying to make your way to the restrooms it is a little confusing and it is easy to go into the wrong one if you aren't paying attention. That happened to me HA!",

Their wings (either the Hot or the Hotter Hot which are quite hot) are excellent.  Perfect amount of sauce, heat, and crisp.  Two more important things regarding Duckworth's.  1) Excellent beer list, well rotated, fresh, and with something for every palate.  2) Excellent ownership/management - They do a wonderful job taking care of their guests and are very knowledgeable on everything they serve.  Definitely a place to try for some casual dining and beer tasting.  Also a good place to watch sports, as there are plenty of TVs.",

It's definitely a locals only kind of place.  I didn't get the best service at the bar, probably because the bartenders were clearly catering to the regulars who come in all the time.  I asked to have a TV changed to a Hurricanes game, and the manager had to approve it.  When the regular next to me wanted to see a Dallas Stars game, they changed it no problem...  I also have a problem with a place that charges extra for seasonal beers. $6 for a 16oz pour of a seasonal beer from Asheville, NC is excessive when I know for a fact Highland charges the same for it as they do all of their beers.  It's price gouging at its finest.  At the same time, I was crazy enough to pay it cause the beer is that good.  Oh well.  I might go back, might not.",

    "text": "I'm baffled by the positive reviews of the food here. I wanted to like this place, on account of the vibe and impressive beer selection, but the food made that truly impossible. We came on a Sunday night and ordered a salad and pulled pork platter. Our appetizers were the fried banana peppers and the caprese salad. The fried banana peppers are just not something you want to eat a whole plate of - after about 5, the spicy, briny flavor and oodles of friedness just get to be overpowering. The caprese salad was drowning in dressing. The entree salad wasn't bad, but not impressive. What really stole the show was the pulled pork entree. The moment it arrived at our table, all we could do was stare. I've never seen pulled pork look wet and gray like that. It's not that hard to make food look edible, so when it looks bad right out of the gate, you know it's probably going to be awful. And awful it was. I've known my boyfriend for over a decade and this is the first time I've ever seen him send a dish back. He apologetically explained to the server that it tasted like it had been microwaved, and the server admitted that this was actually how they prepare it. Microwaving their pulled pork is apparently standard operating procedure in the kitchen. Based on how wet it was, I'm guessing it's microwaved in a plastic bag and dumped onto a plate. I've never heard of a restaurant where microwaving entrees is part of the protocol in the kitchen. The server admitted that some things on the menu had recently changed, and this was one of them. It sounds like management is trying to save on food costs by cutting corners. But this was truly egregious - no restaurateur with any respect for their trade could possibly condone what's going on in the kitchen at Duckworth's.  All I can guess is that things must have been MUCH better once upon a time here, considering the good reviews this place has gotten. Whatever they've changed, they need to change it right back, stat.  (Note: the manager did take off the entree in question from the bill and the staff was generally OK, but even the service/hospitality of Duckworth's didn't really impress)",

After a tasty dinner at Three Amigos my buddy and I decided to come on over to the best part of Montford for a few drinks and to chill on the patio and enjoy the spring sun. The waiter was super helpful on our arrival and recommended some brews that we were sure to enjoy.  After finishing my first stout I spotted that they sell $6 beer samplers. This is a GREAT deal because they have quite an extensive menu. I generally know what I want in a beer so everything I sampled was good (I think 2 more stouts, an IPA and a Hefeweizen). My buddy also got a sampler so we were able to mix and match.  All in all a good spot. I look forward to trying their food on the next visit.",

Unfortunately our experience was unacceptable.  I ordered a side salad, and upon getting to the bottom of it, I discovered a bolt in my salad.  That's right, a metal bolt.  I alerted the manager who apologized for the mistake and offered to \"comp my meal.\"  When I received my bill, the $4.99 salad had been deducted but nothing else. I spoke with our waitress about how horrendous it would have been if I had bitten into the bolt and broken a tooth or eaten the bolt and had to pass it.  Although I shouldn't have needed to do this, I requested two appetizers also be deducted from our bills.  She said she would ask the manager what he could do.  Several minutes later the manager returned to the table with a new bill and said, \"Here you go.\"  He then walked away.  No apology.  No confirmation that the experience was not up to Duckworth's standards and to please come back again.  Just a short and rude response.  While I certainly hope this is an out-of-ordinary experience, I cannot recommend Duckworth's based on my customer experience.",

    "text": "My group of 4 ended up at Duckworth's as a last choice (the restaurant we wanted to go to had a two-hour wait). I reluctantly agreed to \"bar-food,\" but was delighted when I realized what a gem this place is! We sat on the patio and enjoyed people watching the early-Montford crowd.  The menu is big with lots of appealing choices for diners. My boyfriend and I split a cheesesteak (recommended by the people eating with us) and a side salad. He also got some Sweet Heat wings which he said were very tasty -- although he would have liked a smaller option than the 10 wings. The side salad was big and tasty. I expected a nasty, small garden salad (you know what I'm talking about), but this was pretty good! The cheesesteak was delicious; we opted for the \"Steak and Egg\" and, while we had hoped the egg would be fried on top of the steak when it was actually scrambled in with the meat (?), I definitely didn't mind the extra protein. As a Northerner, I'd happily go back here when I need my grease-fix. The boardwalk fries were nothing to rave about, but we didn't mind since we were so full from the sandwich anyway.   Thanks, Duckworth's!",

On this vist, we were just stopping in for drinks and did not have anything to eat. The place was not tremendously busy since we arrived before busy dinner hour. However, service was a bit on the slow side. Of course, they have a great selection of beer, so that sort of helps make up for the so-so service.",

Prices are reasonable and they had Hopslam - YUM - for $6 bucks a bottle Monday night.  Awesome!!  They said they have a good inventory of it so we will definitely be back when we run out!  The atmosphere of this place is pretty relaxed.  Plenty of large screen tvs for watching the games.  The booths are really comfy and looks out on busy Park Road.    The service was friendly and fine.  This past Monday it seemed like a family place but probably for sports games it fills up.  I will definitely be back if I am in the neighborhood!",

They have I think 60 selections of beer and most importantly the staff seems well versed in the types of beer, etc.  That's a plus for an inquisitive guy like me.    I had the cobb salad and it was just fine.  Topped with grilled chicken and dressed in a vinegarette dressing to finish it off.    My favorite part (I think I noted this in my review of the other Duckworths) is the $3.00 nightly drafts.  It's not just the crappy beer included in that!  I had a fantastic IMP IPA while I was there.    This location, while furnished with comfy booths, etc. still isn't the size of the one over in Ballantyne.  It's probably half the size or smaller I think.",

    "text": "Not much to analyze....this is more Sysco slop straight off the truck.  Minimal prep required with minimal generic taste to match.  Salads drowned in dressing with the dressing full of enough MSG to swell your ankles up for a week.  Dazzling array of beers tempered by the knowledge that half of them aren't very good.  Must echo the review on this page noting that checking IDs of people obviously well beyond age 21 insults the intelligence of all concerned and tends to sour the relationship with the bartender from the word go.  Smug buttons with 'We ID everybody' don't compensate for legal overkill, intellectual laziness and a lack of common sense.  Too many of today's parents of young children believe that any place serving food is fair game for the little darlings even if the establishment in question is primarily a bar.  One mother, who apparently was an employee but off-duty, brought the little heathen 'Crawford' (groan) over to sit him on the bartop where he grabbed straws and napkins out of the caddy and hurled them in random directions.  Of course, mom thought this was adorable - adults trying to enjoy an adult beverage somewhat less so.  I don't smoke but perhaps a rethink of smoking bans is warranted if it prevents every establishment from becoming a branch of Chuck E. Cheese.  it's a shame that local places have fallen prey to the same assembly line mentality as their corporate competition.  Duckworth's tastes like Chili's tastes like Applebee's tastes like Friday's.   Given that all are buying the same raw materials from the same vendor this shouldn't be a surprise but it is nevertheless discouraging trying to find a place where they actually use recipes rather than reading directions on the side of a box.  The quest continues.",

I've been dining here ever since I moved to Charlotte, and at one point considered myself a regular.  First, they have an extensive beer selection, most of which are on tap. They also have a beer club you can join and earn points towards prizes. My favorite is actually their strawberry whit blend. So fruity and refreshing! Their food is delicious and they have everything from burgers to salads, ribs to fajitas, tacos to desserts. They also have a kick-ass philly cheesesteak, and being from Philly, I'm allowed to say that lol   They have a large indoor seating area, bar seating and cute outdoor patio seating. The service is typically good, you may have a fluke every once in a while. If you're looking for good, filling fare, this is your place. It's also really close to other restaurants and bars in Montford.",

Yes, there are enough tv's to distract you from those you really don't want to be there with in the first place (lol).   BUT.... in order to experience all of that, you have to get service. On the first visit, it was a Friday and the place was semi-packed (we went earlier in the evening) but it took us 10 minutes for our waitress to finally acknowledge that we were sitting there (we watched her check on the table beside and behind ours). The food was good enough for us to return and the draft beer were a decent price (low as $5/glass without special). The waitress was nice and informative on the beer selections so I figured we could give this place another try.   On our second visit (Thursday evening)... we were quickly seated and waited 15 minutes before deciding to leave. I'm not sure who our waitress was supposed to be, but there were two ladies that were assisting the tables surrounding us. One of them walked around with a pitcher to refill waters... she looked at us and saw that we didn't have any cups on our table and instead of stopping (because she had walked past the table a few times by this point) to ask if we had been helped, or if she could take our drink orders... she turned away and continued check the other customers.   Common courtesy and basic customer service goes a long way... unfortunately I cannot say that I will give this place another try, as Park Rd is starting to expand it's 'bar and grill' options.",

I get the margarita and i request the tomatoes to be chopped and extra buffalo mozzarella cheese. It's so good!  I almost always get there scrumptious beer battered onion rings. They come out nice and plump. There are no shrimpy sheds of onion here.   Recently, I had the cheese sticks and loved them!! The outside is nice. It's not that crumbly seams almost like hard little pieces of corn. It's awesome! Highly recommend them!!  The last time I sat outside and the first pizza was burnt, and the second was cold.

Wasn't very welcoming. The buffalo blue cheese chips could have used more toppings. My boyfriend ordered the pizza special. You receive 9 toppings for $11.99. He informed our server that he was a pescatarian (only eats seafood). The server had to ask the kitchen if he could substitute shrimp. Of course the answer was yes. About two slices in, not realizing because of how hungry we were, he noticed bacon pieces all over the pizza. When we told the server his response was \"I'll have them make another one.\" No apology or expression at all. After that of course we didn't want another one. Took about 5 minutes for the manager to come over. Of course he apologized and took the pizza off. Feeding meat to someone that doesn't eat meat is a pretty big deal. The pizza was taken off but that was it. They even left the pizza on the table. Why would we want a reminder of the mistake that occurred and stare at a pizza you can't eat. I expect a lil more compensation for something like that. Not looking for a free meal in any way. In a situation like that, i would expect more than just taking off the mistake. I just there needs to be more personality and care from the employees and management.",

Unfortunately,  over the past couple of years, culminating with the reopening of the old Fox and Hound location, it has become less and less local, and more and more corporate, with today's episode really proving the point.  So you understand how money hungry they have become, you should know that they now have a policy that they will not mix salad dressing and salad for you.  It's \"Corporate Policy\" when they are too busy  not to toss a salad in the kitchen.  That's what we were told.  Take a look at the trend in reviews for their restaurants and you'll get the hint.  Maybe  they are hoping to be the next Hickory Tavern, but this would never happen there.  It looks like the duckworth brand has become associated with over reaching in pursuit of expansion.  Go somewhere else, you work too hard for the money they aspire to underdeliver for.",

Bartenders walked past number of times and just continued to clean behind the bar.  You can tell when someone has taken notice of you, but for some reason they were more set on cleaning.  After about 25 minutes asked the server for the beer again and finally received it.    Saw the manager take notice of all the finished dishes on our table and never did anything about it.  After a half hour, decided to clear the dishes myself and place on table next to us.    Total fail on part of the owners and management.  Sorry you had to work on the Super Bowl, but it's the business you choose to work in.  Only plus side was when Kendra took over as our server and was attentive to us for the rest of the evening.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about Duckworths for quite some time so my wife and I decided to give it a shot. We were not disappointed.  The place is a little on the small side, just one aisle of booths and tables. There is also a seperate small bar area at the front of the space. Several TV's. Not big on the atmosphere. The only saving grace in this area is the outside seating.  The food is decent. We split a full cheesesteak, and the blue cheese chips. Not the greatest cheesesteak but not bad at all. A good value for the price.  The waitstaff is pretty good, they seem to be on top of things. Checked in on us often, made sure we had everything that we needed, and weren't too pushy.   Duckworths is  a beer-centric place with a great beer menu. They currently have 20 beers on tap, and are constantly rotating their tap list to keep it interesting. Another thing that I really like is that they know how to serve their beer, in the correct glassware, at the right temperature. They are not serving Natty lite in a frosted mug. They have a very good list of bottles available too. They have great specials too Mon & Wed is $2.50 local (N.C.) drafts, Tues & Thurs is $2.50 all drafts, Fri, Sat & Sun they pick 2 or 3 draft to be $2.50.  I understand that they are in the process of moving into a larger space on Park Rd. I believe they said they should be operational by the end of May. I am told they will have 60 beers on tap, and 3 casks  All in all a great place for a beer fan, a family, or just someone looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UPDATE  Duckworths has recently opened their new location on Park Rd. and it is terrific. The place is much larger and more up to date than the previous location.   The service is as good as ever and now they have 60 taps with some great craft beers and a cask engine. Really the premier spot for craft beer in the Charlotte area.  I am really impressed, I am usually there at least once a week and have never had a bad experience.",

My hotel is usually close to the bigger chain grill and taphouses - you know, the one that conjures images of big-eyed aliens and the one that sounds like a Mexican restaurant with good Mac-n-Cheese. However, while the Saucer is pretty good, this place, with a few less taps, eats their lunch. The craft beer selection is managed very well, offering quality hard-to-find pours. In one sitting, I had Hopslam, Big Bad Baptist, and La Terrible: rarities on draft in my travels. As for their food, I can only comment on their wings. Why? Because I can't bring myself to have anything else. Perfectly cooked, perfectly sauced, and delicious, with rich blue cheese to accompany them, as any respectable wing should expect. Ranch lovers, step off, and get a damn salad. But I digress. If you love wings, even with ranch (you probably ate ketchup on everything as a kid, didn't you?), Duckworth's is a wing artisan. I look forward to my next trip to the CLT.",

I arrived shortly after noon on Sunday, craving a Bloody Mary. After being carded, ha ha, I received one of the best drinks I have had in a while. It had a great spice with a hint of heat, which I love, and two olives. Perfect !  Having never been before I asked my waiter for his recommendation out of the sandwiches. He recommended the Chicken Filet sandwich in a wrap. I went with his choice. The wrap arrived, chicken grilled too perfection, and a lot of it, with bacon, shredded lettuce, cheese, mayo and honey mustard.  It hit the spot and although a little messy I would definitely get it again. I chose the tator tots as my side, hot and cooked perfectly, although a little greasy, but every once in while everyone needs a little grease.  While I enjoyed the games on the multiple TVs I saw some great salads go by, ribs, and smelled the amazing fajitas being served on a sizzling platter. Look forward to checking out more of Duckworth's menu.  And, one added bonus, I thought the customer service was outstanding. Not only was my waiter attentive and friendly the Manager arrived to make sure everything was okay. And, he continued to visit tables during my entire visit, something you do not see too often these days. Great Job!",

We also had a hamburger which was jade out of good beef but it was just a regular burger. Helpful and friendly staff. An overall good place to go from time to time.",

Seriously.  We see Duckworth's all the time as we drive past it every other day or so.  It's close to our \"hood\" and it's always busy!  We pulled in, I rolled out and walked in without Hubs...because again, I was starving.  I had planned on ordering  to go order so I could devour it in the privacy of my own home but we ended up staying and we sat at the bar.  The bar tender saw that I was about 2 minutes from passing out and went and hurried my order.  Tadaaaaa burger came out.. FAST! It was just what my stomach ordered!  Place is clean, fun, TONS of tv's for watching your favorite college or NFL or any sport, staff is friendly, service was quick, food was good and I will now like to come back and partake in the great patio that they also have!  Thank you Duckworth's for quickly putting food into my belly! :)",

    "text": "First thing that came to my mind... Long bar - long row of draft beers - yes. I came here to try out some of their beers and eat their food. I asked the bartender to give me the sampler with the highest ABV content that they had... And lets say they hooked me up.  A few stouts in, I decided to order their original Philly steak. Instead of provolone cheese though, I instead got mozzarella on it. Just because I just love that stringy cheese on it! (My friend got the white American, but we all know my cheese was more stringy)  Fries was a little bit too salty for my taste, even though they were restaurant made and cut. That isn't bad, but still a little salty. Service was great, the bartender helped me and explained all the beers and described how they tasted which helped me decide which one was the best. I had the Avery stout which was a fruity type of stout that I thought was the best. (Don't go for my word on it though, my bartender left telling me that and I'm not too sure off that info is correct)   If I lived close by here though, I would probably come here for a beer a day. Overall, I definitely will come back here just to drink. Nice vibe, good amount of tv's for your sports junkies, and beeeeerrrrr. I definitely recommend to come by and check this place out.",

The 60 taps are always thoughtful, sometimes rare, and obviously plentiful. The bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable, and they take their beer seriously, but they aren't snooty about it. The fella is a beer nerd, and I'm a total novice, and we both love it. Even the food is surprisingly delicious for \"bar food.\"  We typically go during the day on a Saturday, so neither the parking lot nor the inside is very crowded, but this is always our go-to when we're looking for a comfy, casual place to drink. There are a bazillion TVs in the bar and the restaurant, and they have free wi-fi, so it's a great place to watch a game or just hang out with friends.",

I think the name sounding like a wealthy cartoon character or some other preconceived notion kept us away....idk, but luckily we made time to get here.  The interior is pretty big, with lots of booths and non-shared tables, which is nice, because I hate being stuffed in like cattle.  All of our servers were great and engaging, and even the managers stopped by a couple times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  In general they serve pub/bar food with a lot of variety, kind of like a larger and nicer version of Applebee's menu. We fired some of their Mommoo's wings, which were char grilled and underrated spicy, but I would get them again.  We also got the BBQ Chicken & Jalapeno Bacon Flatbread, which was quite large and delicious as well.    I think their main selling point is that they have a giant variety of beer.  This doesn't move the needle much for me, but the beers we tried were good, so more power to em.  I do really want to come back here, because their menu is huge, with a lot of variety, so I would love to try some of their other options. (e.g. pizzas, burgers, etc.)",

We were confused and asked if we could sit down to have drinks and she wouldn't communicate with us any further, it was very bizarre. We decided to sit down in the bar area to figure out where we were going to go and she would not stop staring at us! The most uncomfortable situation ever for a patron.

It's always difficult for me to decide between the Taphouse Burger and the Chicken Philly, both are excellent!  Their beer selection is outstanding!  There are almost too many to make a choice!  But the one thing that keeps me coming back is the customer service.  Their servers are attentive and fast and always seem to be in a good mood!  I highly recommend Duckworth's!!",

My first time there, I thought someone forgot their iPad as their beer/wine list is on a tablet that has a large selection of beverages. (Try their \"Post Prohibition Old Fashion\"). Now to the food. First we ordered the Tater-Tots, which were so golden & crunchy and the house-made BBQ-Ranch sauce was made from the Gods of Sauces. After we were done, we decided on our entrees which included the Buffalo Chicken Philly and the Shrimp with Fontina Cheese Flatbread. So the Buffalo Chicken Philly is what you would think of if Buffalo and Philadelphia food staples came together as \"Buffadelphia\". (Hey, not a bad name). As we were sharing the flatbread, my mind wandered as if we traveled 11 hours to Italy to dine at one of those tiny cafe's while I traveled with Forrest Gump on a shrimp boat. Once I got back to reality, our plates were spotless as the check came that did little damage to my wallet.",

They also had another special that included a growler, which I might have to check out next time. I went with their chicken pesto sandwich, and I asked for it without the bun, and the presentation when it came out was quite nice in place of the bun (I was too hungry and forgot to take a picture of it).

Well people screw it up allllll the time (especially in the south)  Not here! I'll be back in a few days for another one!  Goodness gracious it was soo yummy.   The service was good. There are tvs everywhere, they have A LOT of beer on tap, a big menu to accommodate your whole crew(even the picky ones), a patio and its conveniently located right on park road at the corner of Montford.   I also like that they are open In between lunch and dinner, as often as I'd love to eat at 12, work or life pulls you in other directions so this is good place to come.... I mean today we had lunch at 4 lol and they accommodated and had a nice little crowd in there catching up on Indy and Coca Cola 600 news! Ya know what?

Instead of creating new burger with correct cheese, they took the burger back and melted an additional cheddar cheese slice on top of the American cheese slice with the top of my burger bun now soggy from them potentially zapping the burger in the microwave. So, therefore, burger not impressive. The only thing I liked was the bacon they put on the burger which was quality stuff. I would not order this again.",

    "text": "I travel for a living all over the US and this is a surprisingly good place for a business traveler to decompress and refuel. I've been visiting Duckworth's off and on whenever I travel to Charlotte and my most recent experience is from going there three days in a row.  The beer selection is extensive and more varied than you would find in any brewpub. This is a tap house with emphasis on the taps. If you can't find a beer that suits your taste....you just don't appreciate great beer. The Noda Hop Drop IPA is my personal favorite.  On the food side, you will be pleasantly surprised. Their simple mixed green side salad is well presented, fresh and plentiful. Sounds off base, but if a restaurant can't get the side salad right, they probably don't spend much time on the rest of the menu. The Steak Salad is a good choice too. Be sure to check the daily specials. Today was Beef Brisket Taco's and they were amazing!!! My business associate also ordered them and was impressed. They should make these part of the regular menu. The grilled marinated shrimp skewers are also very good.  On day one of this trip, I accidentally left my credit card behind. When I returned the following evening, Tara Lee had my card waiting for me. She saved me from going thru the cancellation hassle, so kudos to this charming bartender.    Take this advice from a seasoned road warrior. If you want a great bar to park your tush, drink some great beer, eat inspired food and watch some sports on a bank of flat screens, Duckworth's has you covered.   P.S- Ask for Tara and if she will help you pick out just the right brew.",

They have an impressively large selection on draft (including seasonals and hard-to-find-on-tap beers) and an even more expansive selection in bottles. All styles, flavors, and nationalities are represented.  As others have said, the food is bar food, but decently done for what it is. My go-to are their hot dogs. Toasted buns and franks exploding with juicy goodness. The perfect thing to help wash down your beer.  The staff is friendly and fun, and pretty fast and responsive, given how busy this place is. It's relaxed with no pretenses. It's quiet enough to hold a conversation but not so quiet that you feel dumb for yelling at the idiot ref on TV. If you haven't been yet, you're really missing out.",

    "text": "Duckworths at Ballantyne was my top favorite restaurant.  Moved down the list to third. Great wings, fajitas, BBQ, and awesome Philly Cheesesteak. This is until they decided to expand.  We go out of our way because the closest restaurant to us is 30 minutes away. The last two visits were terrible. There is a difference between charred and burnt and cooks need to know this.  At the Uptown location our wings literally were burnt and had terrible burnt taste. My husbands fajitas were burnt also.  The onions were totally black and the \"charred\" chicken taste so burnt it was inedible.  Too expensive of a meal for this.  Waitresses should refuse to deliver food to the table. We don't like to complain or return food but it has really become necessary when our food is being delivered so burnt it is all you taste and miss the great grilled flavor.   Our last visit was the Park Road location and our wings were burnt again. So black and charred all you could taste was burnt flavor.  My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the burnt taste overpowered the great grill flavor. We again hate to complain but decided to just let our server know because we hate to see our favorite restaurant start falling in the ranks.  Sad, but expansion tends to do that to a good restaurant.  \"Tool many cooks in the kitchen spoil a good meal\" might just be the phrase for the fast growing chain. We didn't get them to recook anything or expect any compensations, just want Duckworths to stay on top and get chefs to get some training from Ballantyne location. Note: There is a fine line between charred and burnt and too many times you are crossing that line.",

Duckworths Management more than made up for the blunder experience. These are great people that want to make sure you are taken care of. As soon as I walked in the door after my review a Kurtis (bar manager) immediately apologized and treated me to a gift card, made sure everything was top notch and has done so every time I have seen him since.

The beer selection is outstanding and well priced.  Looking at the specials menu, it seems like they have great specials everyday of the week! We tried the wings and they were amazing!  The menu is pretty extensive and is better than the average bar food... I had tacos and my boyfriend opted for the Carolina BBQ.  We were both very happy with our meals.  The portions were also very generous so we had leftovers. Prices are reasonable and this place is very casual and has a good atmosphere. It's a great place to grab dinner or just grab a beer in the bar and watch a game.  Lots of TVs all around.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Went  to the soft opening of Duckworth's. i made a new restaurant since they changed their name, location and updated the menu. So, maybe this should be linked to Duckworth's Cheesesteakery.   i was a big fan of the Cheesesteakery, but while  their old location was in a good spot the inside was extremely limited.  Now the inside is much more open, inviting and improved. They've also revamped the menu from what i can tell adding fancier steaks and such (don't remember seeing them before), but holding over the good stuff.    We had some fried mushrooms which were okay. Nothing special, just something fried.  The jalapeno chicken was extremely delicious. Regular price is $14.99 but i think it was worth the price. The wife thoroughly enjoyed it. i can't resist ordering the buffalo Philly cheesesteak. i've never been to Philly, so maybe my taste buds don't know the 'real' thing. But i thoroughly enjoy it with their sweet potato fries.  Delicious.  They were my favorite place to get good draft beer before, and now they increased from 20 to like 60 beers on draft! It is a beautiful thing. With $2.50 specials on ALL beer on Tuesday and Thursday, i don't know of a better place in the area. Every day there is supposed to be select $2.50 drafts.   The only drawback appeared to be the parking situation which is somewhat limited.",

Venue - your typical bar-sy place. Yet I would say its cleaner and cool. Definitely not dirty, otherwise, I wouldn't come back here again.   Food - I like their ribs/wings combo you can order. The ribs are good, little on the dry side, but still edible. The wings are alright, but very greasy (aren't wings greasy anyways?). I had an opportunity to order mushroom burger, on other day that I came here. It was decent. *shrugs*  Drinks - they have my favorite wine-Belgian beer, Linderman's Framboise!   I would be back for an outing at the bar area, with friends.",

    "text": "Well I finally made it to the new DGT location since my last review and I must say this space is a big improvement and the addition of a nice and large outdoor patio is also great.   Atmosphere - Spacious, modern-ish, lively, mostly 20 somethings but kids and young parents are here too.   Food - I had a boring grilled chicken sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. Boring not in taste but b/c it was just a boring order on my part. Oh, I also tried a special appetizer that they had for the day b/c it sounded interesting. It was a peanut butter & jelly flat bread w/ sliced banana and brie cheese. To bad it tasted awful as it was overcooked.   Service - Friendly, but I would not say attentive as she did not correct the overcooked appetizer.  Overall - The place is still okay and the new location is a nice improvement.  Just be careful when purchasing your appetizers.   Note: This new location for Duckworth's is just down the street from the old location but the reviews and photos are still the same.  With that being said, some of the older photos on Yelp are not relevant anymore.",

The taps constantly rotate and they always have a good selection of seasonals/rarities (Think Stone Enjoy By)  Beer flights are relatively inexpensive and give you a chance to try a bit of everything on the 60+ tap menu.  There is something for everyone, from your most basic of beers to some of the rarest beers in the country.  They have a number of local brews as well as beers from around the world.  The bartenders are well versed in the craft beer scene and will answer any question you throw at them or give you a suggestion on what to try  The beer by itself can be a bit on the expensive side but remember you are paying for quality, not quantity.  The food Menu consists of awesome bar fare and snacks.  I can't get over how good their Philly Cheesesteaks are.  The Smokehouse Philly was one of the better sandwiches I've had at a \"chain\" restaurant.  The Buffalo Chicken Nachos are also very unique and delicious. I was somewhat surprised by the high price of the food bill (Nachos were 14.99, sandwich 13.99).  For Sports, Duckworth's has all the Major sports packages, which is a plus for an out of towner like myself.  If I had 1 complaint it's that the servers aren't too attentive to your needs.  I've asked to have a game put on only to have to ask multiple times before it was changed.  Same for refills, napkins, ect.  Also parking is a bit scarce in the area but not too bad with a strip mall next to it.  Overall this is a great place to enjoy a beer and snack.  I look forward to coming back every time.",

One of the best things about duckworths (IMHO) is that it's open late. It's tough to find a casual spot open late in or near South Park. This is one of our go-to spots when it's late. I also like taco Mac during times like this, but some people find it too big and overwhelming with all of the TVs, countless beer options and so on. Duckworths has the feel of a more intimate sports bar. I like it.  I can't type another word without talking about their food. Specifically their wings. I love their wings! Recently a group of five of us went and split 24 wings and fries and just had a lovely time. I've tried other things (ribs, chicken tenders, salads), but now that I've tried their wings, I'm going to keep coming back for them. They do have daily food and drink specials which are also definitely worth considering.   Service was quick and friendly and the prices aren't bad at all. I'd recommend it!",

From appetizers (try the nachos!) to burgers, Philly cheese steak, and chicken sandwiches, there is something for everybody and it is all good.  Overall this is a welcoming spot with fresh food and friendly service. There are always sports on the many TV's around the restaurant, so it's also a good place to post up and watch games.   My favorite part about Duckworth's is their beer selection. They have dozens of rotating drafts that are often on special, Thursday night most craft drafts are $3.50! You really cannot beat that in Charlotte where drafts are $6.00+ at local breweries. If you have the chance, I would stop in here.",

The dipping sauce is a light honey mustard which went well with it but I definitely could have gone with maybe a double dipper of some cheese. Mustard can burn out the tastebuds especially combined with all the salt coming off the bread. This is the first place I've visited that had philly cheesesteaks on the menu so decided to try the supreme. The mushrooms are definitely canned so skip them. In general it was flavorless, drenched in grease, and over salted. The meat with some garlic and MORE cheese, it was barely noticeable. The bread was flimsy and would be nice if toasted.",

    "text": "I stopped by Duckworth's Kitchen & Taphouse when checking out the Ballantyne area of Charlotte after a friends wedding in South Carolina. First off the Ballantyne area of Charlotte is super nice. A plethora of huge corporate buildings and nice homes and shops. Most of the restaurants I saw were chains that I had already been to and I wanted to try something new and different. This lead me to Duckworth's.  I sat at the bar to watch some of the US Open golf. They have an insane amount of beers on tap and I had a couple of lemon Kolsch which were really good. The food menu is fairly typical for this kind of restaurant/bar with offerings of wings, burgers, cheesesteaks, pizza, sandwiches, and salads. I decided on the BBQ sandwich with onion rings and it was satisfying (About as good as you would expect outside of Eastern NC).   Actually, Duckworth's is somewhat of a mini-chain with several locations in the Charlotte area (I asked). It's really not that unique inside or with the food they offer. I would compare it to a Carolina Ale House, but slightly better. I am giving 4 stars because I was pleased overall with my choice to stop by Duckworth's.",

    "text": "Finding the restaurant was easy, but the parking area in front of the restaurant is a bit small. It's not a problem, however, as there is a large shopping plaza behind Duckworth's that you can easily find parking in. Upon entering, I noticed the decor was very sleek yet gave a nice casual vibe that invites a good time.  Now, I'm not a huge bread fan. In fact, most of the time I skip the complimentary bread options served at many restaurants as I typically just want to get to the real food. With that being said, their pretzel rolls were absolutely amazing! They are served with a Sierra Nevada beer mustard, which was outstanding even thought I'm not a big mustard fan typically either. The rolls themselves were baked with a perfect pretzel crust outside and had the softness of of a roll right out of the oven on the inside. The mustard was also perfectly balanced without being too overbearing. I loved the rolls!  They also have a new Nashville Hot Chicken option. This was my first time having Nashville Hot Chicken and I feel like I've been missing out! I can't compare it to Hot Chicken in Nashville or any other place since this was my first taste of the dish, but it was tasty. I'm a fan, and you like your chicken with a some 'kick', you will be also. I thought the flavor here was great, and the heat came through really well at the end of each bite. Many dishes that are marketed as spicy aren't, but I can say I did get a bit of spice here which was nice.",

I hate to ruin a good thing (ie walking into a table at 7 pm on a Friday), but this was too good not to share.   Adjacent to Montford (in Montford), Duckworths is totally revamped. To be honest, I hadn't been to this location before - but the revamp is an upgrade regardless. New decor, new menu. It's the guinea pig for the other locations. It's the winner.   Elevated above the other standard locations (not Cellar), it's gonna be another go to spot - especially for half priced wine Friday - y'all get rid of this an am gonna be upset. The make your own salad is killer (6 veggie toppings are free including avocado!!)  Pictured is spring mix, avocado, tomatoes, red peppers, blue cheese, mushrooms, House-made onion straws, chipotle ranch, with jalapeno bacon (extra). Yeah, so this combo not the healthiest but it was a long week!  Wine starts at $22 for Gnarly Head before half price discount. We had a nicer Italian dry Pinot Grigio which was great.   Long review, but they earned it. Thanks for the top notch attention too!",

    "text": "I love the recent remodel at this Duckworth's location! We stopped by on a whim 2 weeks ago to grab a beer. Well- it happened to be Wednesday night and they have a $10 burger and brew special, so we ended up staying for dinner and eating at the bar.   Any beer normally priced at $5 is included in the special. I have been wanting to try the Impossible Burger and was super happy that it is included in the Wednesday night deal (normally ~$16 on the menu). I've never had a veggie burger that even comes close to tasting like beef- but this does!!   I am not vegan or vegetarian but am trying to incorporate more veggie meals into my diet these days. I was really impressed when one of the managers came over to ask if I was vegan- explaining that they could sub out the bun and leave off the butter to make the whole thing completely vegan. This level of service and concern over dietary restrictions  is not something I would have expected from a place that can lean towards a sports bar vibe. I'm impressed, and we'll definitely be back. Oh, and by the, way my husband says the regular burgers are pretty damn good too :)",

Having just come from Brawley's nearby, we didn't take advantage of the $3 Thurs draft specials but there seemed to be a pretty good selection. Next time for sure!  We split the half rack ribs and 5 wings platter (comes with 2 sides) and it hit the spot. The wings were fresh, tasty and average size. The ribs were great, nicely cooked and still good the next day. The platter also came with two sides and some texas toast. Overall well worth the $17 for us. Oh and the service was on par! He made sure to come back often but not too often to check on us. I'd come back on another Thursday when I'm thirsty.",

That's a steal. Please keep the Impossible Burger on the menu, Duckworths! Youre our only hope!",

I've had many cheesesteaks in Philly and this is just as good if not better than many of Philly's own famous spots (I'm looking at you Pat's, Gino's and Tony Luke's). I get it with onions and cheese whiz, quite frankly, if you get it any other way, I'm going to judge you and we probably can't be friends. The fries and onion rings are also always on point.",

Not very good. But I'm a tortilla snob. If you're going to offer em, make em fresh. The Philly Cheesesteak was unbelievable. Best cheesesteak I've had since the last time I was in Philly. Awesome.  The bad: The service fucking sucks. Let me be clear: it doesn't just suck, it FUCKING SUCKS. It was slow, lazy and they got an order completely wrong.   The meal came out slowly, which was not that horrible, but noticeable. Still, I thought the restaurant deserved a solid four stars. But as the meal was ending, my dining companion ordered potato skins to-go to bring to his wife. As she was pregnant and had an aversion to certain foods, he very clearly and explicitly ordered the potato skins without onions or bacon.  Well, I'll bet you can guess what kind of merry-go-fucking-fuck-coaster came next, right? It took a half an hour after we were done eating (and twenty minutes after we'd paid for the damn things) for the potato skins to come out. And when they did, guess fucking what? Onions and bacon up on that bitch. Needless to say, my friend and I were livid.   We got the manager and his saving grace (and the only reason why this restaurant gets two stars) is he quickly fixed it. Skins were back out sans onions and bacon and  the amount we paid for them was quickly refunded. Good to know there's one competent person in this restaurant.  I guess maybe some day I can be convinced to go back, but those idiot fucking servers had better tremble if they see my face in that restaurant again. Because if they fuck up, I will come down on that restaurant like the Hammer of Thor.  (With apologies to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.)",

She got our drinks out promptly but then took 25 minutes to come back and ask us what we wanted to eat. I wanted one of their flatbreads but as a pizza. Seems simple enough, right? Well.... the food didn't come out until 6:30-6:45. Mind you there was maybe three tables in the entire restaurant at this point. All of the servers were talking at the hostess stand and my waitress was no where to be found. She didn't check in once and neither did a manager. When the food finally came out a blonde manager brought it out and apologized on it taking so long. There was no explanation as to why it took so long. And if she brought it out she must have known it took a long time- if she was aware why had she not greeted the table within the hour of us waiting for our food? So anyways.. she brings the food out and my order was wrong. It was a flatbread. So she apologized and it told me it would take another five minutes. Twenty minutes later after everyone is done with their food my personal size pizza finally comes out. Terrible service and terrible management. Will not be back.",

It didn't look too inviting, but it was a nice night out, so we decided to sit outside.  The service was great.  Our server was on top of things, even with the drunks next to us.  He was very cordial to them even though they were being pretty stupid.    We had the kids with us so instead of trying their cheesesteaks (it's in the name, so they have to be good!), we decided to order two large pizzas to split.  The Meatza Pizza sounded delicious with its salami, sausage, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, AND regular bacon.  And -- BONUS! -- that just happened to be their \"special\" monthly pizza, on sale for $5 off!  The pizza was delicious, moist, and very flavorful; not dull or dry at all.  We were very impressed!  Next time we'll definitely try the cheesesteaks!",

Much better than other places in town with so many beers (Taco Mac, Flying Saucer).  Their cheesesteaks are the signature dish, but even their salads are pretty good.   They have a great selection of beer and run good specials during the week (now $3.50, formerly $3) on pints so the bar gets packed on those nights.

Seeing all of the people there made me excited to try the food. Surely it would be good, I thought. Wrong!  First off, our waiter put my boyfriend's order in wrong. He ordered the barbecue sandwich but somehow our waiter thought he said the Carolina burger? We brought this to the attention of our waiter who called the manager over. The manager very kindly took it off of our ticket. He had ordered the garlic fries as his side and they were so covered in garlic they were inedible. It was like someone took a spoonful of minced garlic and plopped it on top.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. Which, according to the description, was supposed to have chicken, buffalo sauce, ranch, shredded cheese, and field greens. When I got the wrap I couldn't even tell it was buffalo chicken. There was no cheese to be seen and, the grossest part was that the field greens were slimy and wet...like they were scraped from the bottom of a bag. There was no crunch whatsoever. Absolutely disgusting. The fries I got were not hot, nor were they fresh from what I could tell. We brought this to the attention of the waiter, who got his manager, and the manager took it off our check, too.  We are not ones to EVER send food back or complain (we've both worked in the food industry before), but the quality of Duckworth's food was just terrible. I don't think I'll give this place another try. There are too many restaurants in that area that are much better.",

I love coming here any day of the week for a quick drink or lunch or apps.  Personally, I am a big fan of the hand Crafted Burgers and salads. Now let's be clear. I'm not a vegetarian. However, the \"Impossible Burger\" is heaven sent! Seriously, this burger is 100% plant-based, all natural patty with the look, smell, texture & taste of beef with no cholesterol. Served with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle & mayo. On the flip side, the Bacon Cheeseburger is a great option! Be sure to try the Jalapeno Bacon!",

I had the lemon pepper wings which were outstanding and my friend had the philly. Both were really good. The only issue we had was my side didn't come out on time and the waitress didn't seem new and didn't know anything about the beers on tap. For a brewhouse this is a problem.

The perfect amount of crispiness and spice! I also tried the parmesan garlic wings and they were pretty good too. Very crispy! The sweet potato fries as a side it always a good choice.

Well, this chick had a craving for a burger so I figured the Impossible Burger would satisfy my craving without blowing my hard work. My neighbor friend posted a picture of one last month and it looked delicious.  Kyle was our host and server. He did an amazing job of taking care of us. Ask for him.   I didn't need to look at the menu because I already knew what I was getting. I was surprised to be asked the temperature desired of a plant-based Burger. Hey, I'm new to this LOL  The Impossible Burger is impossibly amazing. Seriously, I didn't have to psyche myself out and think it was meat to get through it like I thought I would. It seriously tasted like a good ol' ground beef patty. Even the texture was reminiscent of a \"real\" burger! I did cheat; I added pepper jack cheese to mine. Hey, I'm still adjusting to this lifestyle! Hubby got his with lettuce, tomato and no onion (the usual toppings on this burger). He, too, was pleased. The secret sauce adds a nice kick of flavor.   I had to ask Kyle what was in this burger! Plants LOL It was just unbelievable.   If you're looking for a plant-based burger without the bland, plant-like taste, you've got to check this spot out!",

Let's get to the food.. I went here on a Saturday due to to it being icy and cold it wasn't to packed. I decided to get the Smokehouse burger which had jalapeno bacon, bbq sauce, pepper jack cheese and house-made onion straws on it. I held off on the cheese because I don't like cheeseburgers (I know I know ). I got sweet potato fries as my side with cinnamon, butter, and sugar on top.   The burger was cooked well and a very nice size.  I loved the sweet potato fries. I was surprised I could finish them all after finishing my burger too. Also, their BBQ RANCH sauce (my bf has some with his tots).. they need to bottle and sell it. I need the recipe it was soooo good.   Great customer service , good range of items, and they have lots of craft beer. Check them out!",

I think I had the Taphouse burger- it's the one with bacon on it. It was a little burnt for me but if it would have been less charred I think it would have been a perfect burger. The bacon was crispy and the sauce is good. The burger comes with a side- I got the sweet potato fries and they were great! This last time I was there I had the torch Pilsner and it was a great beer. The pretzel bread appetizer is my fave- the mustard dipping sauce is delicious!

I have NEVER been a burger person, never got the big fuss over burgers not even as a child. Having been Pescatarian for 10 years and now Vegan for 1 I don't miss the seafood or other items much but if I want seafood I will try it which has t happened more than 3 times this year as a Vegan. I've been following this foodtruck in Orlando who serve the Impossible Burger and while in Orlando this Thanksgiving Holiday I tracked them down and fell in LOVE. I couldn't believe the burger was Vegan, I began to search where I could get it in Charlotte and low and behold the impossible burger arrived to Charlotte April 2018 and only served at ONE PLACE & Duckworth's Park Road is the place to BE.  I walked in with the BIGGEST SMILE on my face and our server felt my energy and was so happy that I was happy to be there. I told him I didn't need time to look over the menu I know what I want and that's The Impossible Burger. I informed him that he could put my order in while my husband and the boys looked over the menu that's how excited I was LoL.  The burger was everything while reminiscing on my experience in Orlando. I had my burger with a side of tater tots. My husband had the fish and chips and our son had cheese quesadillas.  It wouldn't be impossible if you ran into me at Duckworth's indulging in impossible burger goodness.",

It was pretty nice and easy to use.  I ordered a Moscow Mule at the bar and it was made perfectly! I even got carded... Thanks for the self-esteem boost!!    The first item of the food tasting event was a salad with mixed greens, edamame,  kohlrabi, fire roasted corn, Gorgonzola and a champagne vinaigrette. Those are some superfood ingredients. It's not often you have kohlrabi as  a salad menu item. The dressing was very light but flavorful. When you order the salads,  you can get a small for 699 and a large for 999. It's a lot of salad!  The next item on the menu was the hot chicken.  It was soooo good.  I love spicy food,  so this was on point for me.  The flavor was all there with a kick.  There was a slice of a pickle on top of the chicken that balanced out the heat very well. I would have loved to have a couple more of those pickles. That chicken was flavorful and juicy!!  Yummy   Next was pretzel buns with a mustard sauce.  Very good as well.  The buns were crispy on the outside,  soft on the inside. The mustard was good.   Next was the tap house burger.  That burger was huge!!! I really tried to eat all of it because it was so good. I got it medium rare and it was cooked exactly as I asked.  It was perfect really!  I would definitely come back here and definitely have a burger here again. I would have to imagine their burgers are always a goto option.  I did get to try some sweet potato fries and those were pretty fantastic too.",

We were there on the 4th and nobody said anything. Anyway, so we go the the new location and of course they don't have any outside seating available yet. And we have 2 dogs . So we go the the Ballantine location and their patio isn't dog friendly! WTF!!! Literally 2 hours later and I'm fucking starving! I know a bunch of the employees too but we'll NEVER go back!",

    "text": "I loved the old Duckworth's, so yesterday we decided to check out the changes.  I reviewed the Huntersville location at 5 stars previously, this one I would give 3.5, kindly bumping it to 4 for Yelp.  We called the Ballantyne location since they are closer to us about dogs on the patio, which they said no, so then we called Park Road and they said yes, so we ended up at the Park Road location.  They immediately seated us on the patio and brought water out for the pup.  A++ on that.  The new menu...while I appreciate the new simplicity, they took away a lot of my favorites.  My favorite app (banana peppers), my favorite drink (peach martini), and some good menu options (wraps).  This is one reason they lose stars for me.  Just sadness to see some great options go.  The food this time (starters)..we started with the fried cauliflower.  I wasn't interested in the sauce choices, so we went with buffalo, which they were willing to do.  It was not what I expected for fried, but it was really good!  However, when I go out, I like things that I don't make at home or would be difficult/time consuming to make at home.  The buffalo cauliflower just tasted like steamed cauliflower in sauce, something I could easily make at home as a side - another reason to miss the banana peppers!  So while I would say it's good, I would not get again.    The food this time (meal)..Kevin had the chorizo burger and I had the supreme Philly sandwich.  Both were great.  No complaints here.  The new decor...while it is lovely and the patio looks nice, the seating was not comfortable.  I guess they want to get you in and out.  Service was fantastic.  Fast and our server was attentive, bringing us our every request and prompt to refill our drinks.  While I welcome the updates, I also miss the old Duckworth's more.",

    "text": "Updated interior and menu makes this location better than before, but the location still makes this place a distant second to Brawley's across the street for a spot to grab a beer in good weather.   I'm a big fan of smoked wings, so their house specialty Moommo's variety really hits the spot with some good sauce. I just was surprised to not have any ranch or celery to accompany the small tray, but I guess they really are going for a cleaner more minimalist approach or simply forgot.   Made to order salads are a nice option, but not sure they will steal too much business from Chopt over in Park Road Shopping Center.   The flaw here is simply the location: limited parking and a relatively small patio off to the side just do any make this a destination, but rather a good standby.   I was also surprised that a juicy, local NE-style IPA was served in a pilsner glass, rather than a tulip or other glass to better highlight the aroma.   I am very glad Duckworth's has a strong presence around Charlotte and cheers to their tablets to make selecting a beverage more fun with visual assistance.",

The regular fries and tater tots were much better than expected. It was loud because of several football games happening on a Saturday night but that's what you get at a place like this.   The service was just okay, our appetizer came out with our food and our waitress mixed up our beer order but she was very nice. Again if you're going for good wings or what I deem as \"sports\" food my guess is it would be hard to beat!",

Asked again and she said no, so went directly to the Bartender to see if he would put it on and he was in a fog and didn't seem to know what we were asking him to do.  We told the hostess we were leaving because of the game status (remember no one at the bar) and she had one last chance to solve the problem but she let us walk out...walked down to Braswell's and sat at the bar and asked where the Jets/Pats game would be shown and she said \"wherever you would like it\". Well done Braswell's well done!!!",

They do it all well and at reasonable prices.  I'm not a fan of the bbq chicken pizza(?) that was on special the last time I was there.  I and several people from my office go after work on the first Thursday of every month, so it's worth returning too.  The only drawback is that parking can be hard to find since Montford has become so popular, but that doesn't bother me since I usually walk there from my office and then walk home to my condo.",

Almost all draft beers on special - does not include high gravity.   This location is very popular and gets pretty busy. That being said there is a large bar and tons of booths so you will usually get a table. The parking lot is very tight and you usually have to park somewhere down Montford Ave.  Goes with the territory for those that know Montford, but just something to be aware of if you are not familiar with the area.   Staff is always very friendly and service has been great. Overall this is a great place to get a beer with a friend or meet up w a group.",

The wings were less desired but still have an honorable mention. On both, I chose the Sweet n' Bold Gold Sauce but next time, I'm definitely getting the garlic parm wings!!!! (Two of my favorites)  For the sides, the tater tots were the BOMB dot com. It was cooked perfectly where it's crispy on the outside and softer inside. But the sauteed veggies were extremely thin and watery.  So if you ever lose your keys and are almost starving to death, get my meal! It'll totally satisfy your needs.",

Their prices might be a few dollars higher than the bigger chain sports bars, but they have a diverse menu:  pizzas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, and tex- mex selections.  An excellent place to view a game.  They have tons of TVs so they can put 8-12 games on at once. I enjoyed being there for an NFL Sunday afternoon.  The crowd was 60%Panther fans with a good number of NFC East fans as well (Cowboys, Giants, Redskins).  It was good crowd with people interested in the games but no one being obnoxious or rude.  I believe a lot of families enjoy coming here mid week as it's fairly kid friendly. I think they have some family specials mid week.",

If a game is on TV, they'll have a TV for you to watch it on.The food is great for pub food. They have daily specials that the chef creates. If you have a chance to try the Blue cheese & spinach stuffed portabella mushroom take it! Definitely try the buffalo blue cheese chips or as I prefer buffalo blue cheese french fries.",

The food was great too!  I had the blue cheese chips - a delicious first for me, onion rings, and the classic Philly cheese steak.  The only downfall was the service.  When I got there I was not greeted.  Although I was waiting for a buddy of mine, I was shocked that none of the five staff screwing around at the greeters stand said hello or welcome.  So, after roughly ten minutes, I went to the bar to wait  and got a beer.  I felt like the bar keep was inconvenienced by my presence.  How dare I order a beer!  The saving grace was my server once my friend arrived and we moved to a table.  Good job sir!  Although you were the best of the worst, I actually think you did a great job.  Your colleges need to take notes.",

The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived around 8pm, but since we informed them we were there just for dinner and not the 10pm party, we were seated immediately at a table that would be moved eventually for the dance floor area.  We had very attentive and cheerful service from Kendra, our drinks were quickly refilled when needed, and the food was delicious as always.  Whenever I crave chicken fajitas, this is my go-to place.  Our daughter loves the pepperoni and basil pizza, and they have some very tasty, lightly breaded, fried pickles.  Nice way to end the old year and start the new!",

    "text": "If beer heaven was a place, and I'm not ruling out the possibility that it is, Duckworth's is on the shortlist for hosting duties. They boast 40 taps plus a plethora of bottled choices and the beer menu, a four page, single spaced affair, backs them up. As for food, the menu covers nearly every corner of American cuisine, from ribs to wings to pizza to Philly cheesesteaks.  To beer fans I cannot recommend the sampler highly enough: for $5 you a 4.5 oz glass of any 4 beers on tap. We visited shortly after a Stone tap takeover so that fine brewery had a draft plurality and since their choices were rarer the Stone sampler was $8, but still well worth it since it gave the opportunity to compare across the brand. All bottled choices are available for takeout, so consider bringing a treat home for your own brew reserve.  The food is enjoyable but not exceptional. I has a meatball sub with sweet potato fries. The meatballs were distinctly not house-made, but I wouldn't really expect otherwise from a one-stop shopping style kitchen. My roommate had a cheesesteak and it avoided the common misstep of being either overly greasy or juicy. All in all a solid effort.  The atmosphere was clean and more stylish than the 6 tvs above the bar broadcasting various sports events might make you expect. The staff was friendly though a bit slow and our check had to be corrected due to erroneous splitting.  Next time I OD on PBR I know where I'll be going to renew my faith in craft beer, and Duckworth's is that place.",

However, in writing this and being honest - I have only had 1 thing.  That one thing was the Chicken Philly Supreme, and it's awesome.  Get the Boardwalk fries - They are great!

While... the EMT's were still working on her, the manager felt it was more important to accuse us of not paying twenty dollar bar tab (that had already been paid) than to ask if she was ok. He then accused her of going to the bathroom and doing illegal drugs, and wanted to know what drugs she was on.  He later banned her from the restaurant  because, and I quote: \"I don't want anyone in here that may be on medication.\" Apparently he thinks he has the right to demand to know what medication you may be taking in order to overpay for food in his restaurant.   Even after it was explained that she most likely had a reaction to a new medication that she was prescribed he continued to state that he didn't want anyone on medication in his restaurant and that he had the right to know what medications anyone eating there was taking.   I have never witnessed a manager in a restaurant act the way he did, and will never give this place a dime of my money again.  If you believe in privacy and being treated with respect you won't either.",

And since it was the opening weekend, and very busy, I'll overlook the luke-warm temperature of the several different beers that I tried.  The cheesesteak sandwich I had was very good, but the lack of any type of side was disappointing for the price.    There was also a band that night, but the set-up of the new location is not very conducive.  We could hardly even hear the band from where we were seated even though we were not that far away. We had a much nicer time when the bands played in the courtyard.   Unfortunately in life, there are constant trade offs. I just need to find a way to combine the outdoor patio of Macs, the ice-cold draft pours at Icehouse, and the 60 tap draft selection of Duckworths. Oh, and lets add a Macs pulled-pork Philly sandwich to that list.",

Second the beer, what they do poorly with food they make up for in their beer selection. They have a diverse, creative selection of micro brews from all across the country. The only reason I didn't give the beer 5 stars, is they don't have a worldwide selection, only 3 non-US beers.   So go to Duckworth's have a couple beers, then go some place else to eat, then go back and have another beer.",

This place puts Flying Saucer to shame as far as selection goes. I'd venture to say it rivals Mellow Mushroom in Asheville and Tyler's in Durham. The beer prices are EXTREMELY reasonable for such hard-to-find/eclectic selection. The sampler is a great deal (any 4 beers your heart desires for $4.50)  The new place is MUCH better than the old location when it comes to the 60 or so taps vs. the only 12 or 15 they used to have. Cool atmosphere, big bar(s) and plenty of seating. High ceilings, low lights, ESPN. I'll miss the intimacy of the old location, where we got preferential treatment on those slow nights and often got to dink around with the late-night staff. But what you sacrifice in intimacy, is more than made up for in quality AND quantity of the beer selection. A MUST when visiting Charlotte.",

Very extensive menu from apps, to salads, to pizzas, to sandwiches to regular entrees. They ride themselves (food wise) on the sub sandwiches, especially the philly. I went with the buffalo chicken philly which came with ranch, swiss and buffalo sauce with chopped up chicken. Comes in two sizes....7\" and 10\". 7\" was $7.99 and the 10\" is $10.99. Went with the 7\" as I wasn't looking to roll out of the place after wards.   Now my issue...those prices do not come with any sides. They offer a \"make it a meal\" for $3.50 which includes a side & drink. Since I got an iced tea I went with a side of sweet potato fries, which were really good. However; for $11.49, my plate was no where near the size or the quality for that price. I couldn't imagine getting the 10\" for almost $15!   The beer menu was extensive and impressive, and I'll be sure to check it out one more time for the beers since I didn't on this recent trip.",

It was just a bland cheesesteak. I've tasted a lot of cheesesteaks, and have even lived in Philly, and this one was nothing special) The price of the food is expensive for it just being bar food in a bar atmosphere, which was the ultimate reason why this review gets 3 stars instead of 4. I liked how all of the waiters and waitresses worked together as a team, especially since our waitress seemed to forget about us, like one waiter brought our food, and another one bused some dishes as he was walking by and saw they were empty. As a past waitress, I can appreciate the team effort. I would come back to eat here again, just pay more attention to the prices since they're a little high.",

It's a large amount of chicken, much more than the average restaurant.  It comes with 4 tortillas and a moderate amount of fillings (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, beans, guacamole.) Friendly staff, manager and clean bathrooms!  Thanks Crystal for great service!",

    "text": "So I am a fan of everything Duckworths:  beer selection, food, people... everything except the parking situation here.  Except for a couple of compact spaces and few regular spaces out in front, the parking lot here can be somewhat of a deathtrap.  I usually end up parking pretty far away depending on how much I want to risk my life that day, but I just hate having to deal with the overflow from Montford Dr.... regardless... the parking situation isn't changing anytime soon, so I just deal with it.  People PLEASE!  for the love of whatever you believe in, slow down and don't hit pedestrians and other shoppers that have business here - it will not hurt you to wait another 30 seconds to get your latte or whatever it is you are zipping around the parking lot for.  I've had some near misses here.  ANYWAYS... once you survive the gauntlet traffic parking situation, you can rest easy (at least for a little bit)... have a drink to relax and let your blood-pressure recede to normal levels.  This place is usually packed - which is a good sign.  The food is solid - they have daily specials and their servers and staff are friendly and will get you what you are craving.  Pizza, beer, tacos... they have a wide range of food and rather extensive tap list.  If you go to the other Duckworth's in the area, there's an iPad you can see the latest tap list, but this location is old skool and you gotta do it on paper.  You can also check out the website for the list which is pretty upated.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fduckworths.com%2Fbeer-list%2F&s=152be2c1572d11a65ff6ee84083cb583dfbeec34c1fabce582727b94174ca061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">duckworths.com/beer-list</a>  Overall a solid place to grab a beer/dinner after work.  Watch the parking lot though.",

I also enjoy their salads and sandwiches. I think this is also a good place to have a few beers and appetizers, especially cheese and bacon fries!",

We walk in and it looked pretty empty but it didn't matter cause we were hungry. There was someone sitting at the host stand and we were waiting for her to greet us and she just stared at us and when we asked where we sit or what we do she just said someone is about to come. We end up finding out that it was the manager, which was very unprofessional how she treated us. I even asked if they needed bartenders and the server told me she'd come talk to me and she never did. The server was very nice and welcoming and explained the menu thoroughly. When the beer samples came out she didn't tell us which sample was what, which made it confusing to choose. The food was tasty, but my friend said the burger he got wasn't medium well as he asked. Me and my boyfriend got sweet potato fries and asked for honey mustard. The honey mustard was very zesty which is unusual for honey mustard, it was almost spicy. Overall I enjoyed this experience but as a fellow bartender/past server I would've done things differently.",

The atmosphere is very laid back but I still don't know why it is called duckworths. I had some mommoo wings and they were pretty good. They had charred edges and a great vinegary flavor. Now the main course I had a balsamic chicken flat bread and this is where is went downhill. The crust was so flimsy all the toppings fell off and the flavors were not very appealing. I ate 2 pieces and gave up it was just poorly made. The place wasn't very busy but I found myself looking for our server a few times for drinks or napkins. This place could be great but right now it is just ok.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never given Duckworth's a Yelp Review before!!! What the F$%@# was I thinking? Easily the best BEER bar in Charlotte, with about 60 on Tap and many more available by the bottle.  It's not huge in there, but they do have a nice bar area which can get quite crowded, especially at peak times (e.g., sporting events on TV).   The service is always good, and the food surprisingly is good too! You never know what you'll be getting food wise at a bar, but Duckworth's delivers in all areas. I'd say their food is 3.5 to 4.0 stars. I mean, I wouldn't come out of my way for the food, but it's the incredible selection of draft and bottled beers that draw people to this place.  They of course serve a large selection of NC-made beers, but also have some HEAVY hitting micro-brews from all over the world. Me being a Strong Belgian ale kinda guy, I am always drawn to a great Gulden Draak, which they have ON TAP. Also have a nice selection of \"high gravity\" beers, many over 10% ABV.   If you love beer, this is your place. I like Duckworth's SO much better than World of Beer (no food, WTF?) and Flying Saucer up north. But those places also serve a nice selection of beers. Maybe because Duckworth's is in my neighborhood AND it has a great vibe is why I like it so much.  But if you're into great beers, good food and a place that won't force you to miss your monthly mortgage payment, come check out Duckworth's.",

My go to: buffalo chicken Philly... add banana peppers. Sometimes I get it with Cheese Whiz. I know, I know... I'm awful.   When I do have some self control here, I go with the salmon salad and ask for the fish to be cooked in one of the wing sauces. I like terriyaki-hot. I enjoy going here with a group in hopes that I can steal a wing or piece of pizza from someone. Lay off me, I'm starving.  This location has drink specials every day. Tuesdays and Thursdays all the drafts are $3.50. Gah, is it pumpkin beer season yet?!  One big downfall: the parking situation is awful. That's the problem for this entire Montford area.   I was bummed to move away from this hood and being just a couple blocks away from here. However, I am super excited about their new location set to open Uptown in the old Fox and Hound.

    "text": "We came out to Duckworth's after bowling and drinks over on South Tryon. I'd been to the location in Huntersville and really enjoyed that one, so I was excited about trying the Park Road location. When we got there and turned in from the street, I was worried that parking would be an issue, because the lot looked really narrow. We all found spots no problem, and there was a decent amount of people inside. When we left, I noticed street parking that I'm sure alleviates some of the issues that may come with a small-ish parking lot. Next time I go, I'll check to see if there is an adjoining lot in the back. Anyway, we get inside and it's bright with lots of TVs and a really diverse crowd. The hostess seats us promptly and we start perusing the menu. My sister and I decided on the salmon salad, my date ordered the famous Bold n Gold wings (24 of them, yes we all judged him lol), and my brother in law ordered the burger. We didn't have drinks since we'd been drinking at the bowling alley, but I'll definitely review those the next time we stop in. The salmon salad was delish! Crispy outside and warm, flaky inside, with just the right amount of seasoning. My date smashed his wings and fries, and took the rest home to eat while watching the game the next day. My brother in law was thoroughly impressed with his burger too. All-in-all, it was a really great dining experience and we all agreed we'd totally go back. The bathrooms were clean enough, though I only ran in quickly to wash my hands before eating. Can't speak for the stalls. I'm deducting a star because I got sick once I got home. :/ It didn't feel like food poisoning, so I'm for sure going to check Duckworth's out again. Maybe next time to watch a game and have some drinks!!",

    "text": "Duckworth's is a great place to go and grab a unique craft beer and some good bar food with friends or colleagues after work. It is also a good place to catch a game, or watch America's recent obsession, the World Cup.   The food here is much better than I expected. According to the menu, the owners of the place started Duckworth's to bring the taste of Philly down south and put their own spin on the Philly Cheese Steak. With this in mind, I ordered the Steak and Egg Philly. Now I'm not claiming to be a Philly Cheese Steak expert, because I'm far from it, but this thing was impressive. It came with grilled onions, egg, steak, and your choice of cheese. I chose Pepper Jack  of course. The steak was tender and very moist and the combination of the egg and melted cheese gave it a great texture and taste. I definitely would recommend trying it out.   The cheese steaks aren't the only upside to this place. I've also had their wraps, which are above average for bar food. And I've heard great things about their pizzas, although I've never had it personally.   The place has a good atmosphere that is geared toward the craft beer nerds (I embrace this title). There were tap handles lining the ceilings, a display of different craft beer bottles behind a plexi-glass window, and a map of the U.S. with the corresponding beer labels in each state. There is also a nice patio that is great for a summer's night.   The best thing about this place is the beer. They have a rotating tap of all of the craft beers you could want. They normally have some locals (NoDa Brewing, Olde Hickory, Bird Song etc..), but they also have some favorites from around the country (Bell's, Stone, Founder's, etc...). The best way to test the waters and take advantage of the great beer selection is to get the Sampler, which is only $6. They also have a beer club where you can rack up prizes for trying all of their different beers. I'm a sucker for these Beer Club Membership rewards, and will probably end up going here 3-4 times a week.   This is a great local option for a good craft beer, good bar food, and a good atmosphere. I will definitely continue to go and would recommend stopping in for at least a pint.",

With the beers, a plate of \"ultimate chicken nachos\" that took about ten minutes to arrive while we sipped at beer.  You don't want to order this by yourself. In fact, it's probably too much for just two people. A full pound of nachos (we were told they fry them here in the kitchen rather than buy them already cooked) and a pound of grilled chicken with a lot of melted cheese, chopped onions and scoops of sour cream and guacamole. We had the jalapenos on the side. It went down well, though I was bummed there were no refried beans under those chips. Isn't that how nachos are supposed to be done?  Anyway, our bartender was friendly and a nice enough guy even if he is a Jets fan.",

We got to the restaurant about 7:50 and was told it would be about a 25 minute wait (which was fine by us). The wait time ended up being about 10-15 minutes. We got seated and looked at the menu, we were slightly disappointed to see that it wasn't the same menu we saw online (come to find out this location is the test kitchen and they have a slightly different menu). My friend had already picked out what she wanted based off the online menu. After looking over the menu we found something we wanted and it did not let us down. It did take a while for the food to come out, but it was worth the wait. The food was cooked to perfection, and very flavorful. I was debating between the lemon pepper wings and the nachos (a couple across from us had the nachos and they looked delicious). I ended up going with the wings, but started to think I made the wrong choice, when I saw numerous plates of nachos coming out of the kitchen. I was happy with my wings (but I will try the nachos next time).",

Duckworth's is one of the only places I've seen this beer (let me know if anyone knows of another). They have a great selection of beer ranging from $3 on up.   Our bartenders were attentive and were able to keep up with the crowds from the game. Speaking of football games, holy tv land. There isn't a bad spot in the restaurant to watch the game.

Thursday is their $2.50 Pint Night, and with some exclusions on the higher priced beer  there are still plenty of choices.  However I am almost beer illiterate, so it was like reading French when I was trying to decide on my beer order.  Ended up with a pilsner (you should be happy I remember that word...), it was still kind of hoppy for my taste.  Sometimes I just want to see the word Bud, or Miller.  I ordered a 1/4 lb. Carolina Burger.  To my surprise, it is only $5.29 for that and it even comes with 1-side.  Sweet potato fries was delicious.  Their regular fries weren't bad either.  Most of the sandwiches/salad are around $8.99.  One of the girls ordered a salad and it was huge.    Service overall was decent, even after it got busy.  I give this place a solid approval.",

The food is comparable to Taco Mac, as is the service, but this is a smaller footprint with great TV, less noise and a more low-key crowd. She ordered wings, which she enjoyed and I ordered a chicken salad, which was fine. Yep, the food isn't to rave about, but it's puts Hooter's to shame.",

There's also a ton of other stuff on their menu so if you can find something you like here then you've got your own issues.  Also a great beer selection.  However, my most recent visit I left, not disappointed, but more so frustrated by the service. Food was excellent per usual, but my server was dumb as a box of rocks.  I ordered a cheesesteak and CLEARLY stated that I wanted no tomatoes.  She proceeded to take the other orders from our table, and then confirmed with me before leaving that I wanted NO tomatoes again.  \"Yes\", I replied.  Then, she walks over to the computer to put in the order, and she yells over to me and asks if I wanted tomatoes on my sandwich...?  A bit baffled, I respond \"NO\".  Meanwhile, I had asked her to change the channel for one of the TV's and she said she would.  That didn't happen as we waited 25+ minutes for three cheesesteaks in a basically empty restaurant.  And then the food comes out and guess what...?  My cheestesteak has 4 ripe and juicy tomatoes sitting right on top.  And she messed up the sides for my friends sandwiches.  Picked em off and the sandwich was great!  Not hating on the place, but this girl needs to tighten up her service.  Still a fan and will be back!",

Coconut cake oh my goodness! Then I had the snickers pie the other night-sadly, a special for the day...  Atmosphere: Nice atmosphere when it's not too crowded, but if it is, it isn't too bad either. We went during the World Cup US versus somebody where the US lost and sat on the patio. Even with the people there for the game, the atmosphere was nice. Servers are all friendly",

Everyone else enjoyed their food as well, for the most part. MY one complaint is they seated the five of us at a table that really should have been a four top. There was another table right behind us in the same situation. While the rest of the area was empty, we were placed right on top of one another. They could have easily pulled two tables together and given us more room. Even as the place got busier, there were many tables left empty. AS I mentioned, the service was quite friendly and on top of refills, etc. The food was tasty and hot. This is not something that will keep me from coming back again, but (admittedly, I have a larger than average personal air space) it does factor into my enjoyment overall when I am having trouble banging knees with others, overlapping utensils, and finding a place for all the plates.",

The bar service was friendly and fast at both locations but the food service was slow and the food was poorly prepared at both locations. I ordered their house special wings (mamoo's wings?) at Ballantyne. It took approximately 30 minutes to get them and when they came out they were cold and the sauce had separated into 1/2 spices and 1/2 grease. I tried to eat a couple of the wings but ended up pushing the plate away and decided to skip eating and just finish my beer and leave. At the Southpark location I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. Again it took 20-30 mins to get my food (several people who came in after me got their food before I did) and there were very few people in the restaurant.  So not sure why the food service was slow. The chicken was completely over-cooked (charred thin pieces dry as leather) and they forgot to put the buffalo sauce on.  I won't be going back.",

I brought a large group here on a Saturday evening (they weren't too busy when we got there) at the recommendation of a friend and I found it to be completely disappointing. We had 7 in the group. Everything about the place was disappointing. We weren't asked for a drink order for 15 minutes; our food order wasn't taken for 45 minutes to an hour; the food came another 30 minutes later; and the food was well below average. I ordered a 16 oz porterhouse steak with sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. The porterhouse was a little overcooked and had a mushy exterior with no grill marks or char as if it had been cooked on a grill that wasn't hot enough (or a Foreman grill). The sweet potato fries were decent but there were hardly any of them. The grilled veggies were mushy and served in a pool of what appeared to be oil...yuck. They did have a decent sample of beers here which is nice but I would never go here again for a meal. All told I left feeling like I had wasted 2 plus hours of my life waiting on food that I'd rather have not have eaten.",

This is Mr. P's favorite bar/restaurant because of the reasonable price and extensive selection of draft beer.  I'm not a huge beer drinker myself but even I get excited reading the beer menu.  My husband, on the other hand, acts like a kid in a candy store and spends a ridiculous amount of time salivating over the beer menu while trying to make his selections.  The restaurant is in a great location (park road shopping area) and the management and servers are extremely friendly and helpful.  If you have a hard time deciding on a beer the servers are more than happy to let you try samples before committing.  The dining area indoors is a little boring (off white walls with little to no decorations), but the outdoor area is nice with plenty of people watching.  And, if you're lucky, you can sometimes even hear the trivia from across the street at Angry Ale's in the evening.  The menu is pretty decent with a good variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entrees.  I highly recommend the cobb salad.  It's easily enough for 2 meals and so delicious loaded up with a balance of healthy (lots of veggies and grilled chicken) and unhealthy (blue cheese, cheddar, bacon, yum!)   toppings.  I always dread trying to find a parking spot in their tiny parking lot.  You're usually better off just parking along the street.  Overall, if you are (or want to become) a beer drinker this is definitely a place you need to try.",
