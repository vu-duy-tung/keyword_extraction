I've had a few different items on the menu and sampled a few of my wife's selections over the years, and everything has been phenomenal.  Easily one of the best Italian restaurants in Charlotte, the service is always above average and the food is appropriately priced.  I personally recommend.  - If you get salad, the only way to go is their house dressing. - Stromboli, it's huge, it's meaty, and it's cheesy, what else do you want? - Nothing washes down a nice Italian dinner better than a glass of Chianti. So have two.",

It was pretty busy when we came in, but service was still fast and friendly. The margherita pizza was just okay, too much sauce and not crispy enough. The gorgonzola tortellini though was pretty good. Super cheesy in the typical Italian fashion. On the plus side we did have some leftovers for the day after.   Just okay, I may or may not visit again.",

But after 15 minutes, not one of them had come by to check on us, bring us water, or take a drink order. Finally we just got up to leave. I can't rate the food because we couldn't get any service to take an order. But the service was atrocious. Worst I've experienced in Charlotte.",

    "text": "We dined at Portofino's on Park Rd this weekend- the third time I have eaten at this location. We are huge fan of the Portofinos on Eastway - but for some reason, this location has not been good for us.     To start with, we selected a bottle of red (Portofino Ripasso) which was very enjoyable.  Sadly, the rest of our meal wasn't as good as our wine.  We both selected from the specials of the day which came with a house salad and bread.  It took quite a while for our entrees to arrive, and when they finally did, I eagerly cut into my chicken dish and was dismayed to find ham (before ordering, I had told our server that I did not eat beef or pork, yet he neglected to tell me that the special I had selected was prepared with pork). In any case, they were kind enough to take back this entree and let me make another selection. I selected one of the fish specials.  But sadly, by the time it arrived I was no longer hungry so they boxed it for me to take home. I ate it the next day for lunch and while the fish had a nice flavor (it was a bronzini sauteed with mushrooms, capers, and cherry tomatoes ), since it was a whole fish rather than a fillet, it was filled with bones to the point that it was not enjoyable to eat.  Also, it was served with a side of garlic pasta which was dripping in olive oil. (I love olive oil, but this was to the point of excess!!)  In any case,  I would not recommend this dish to anyone!   My boyfriend selected the other fish special of the day and he fared much better than I did. His seabass (which was a fillet rather than a whole fish) was perfectly cooked and served on top of a bed of risotto with a stuffed portobella mushroom cap on the side.    Since we had the mishap with my entree, they offered us a complimentary dessert with coffee. We selected the tiramsu. It was ok but they were skimpy on the marscapone and tried to cover it up  with gobs of whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  All in all, this meal was a huge disappointment given that we dropped over $100 (for 2 entrees, no appetizer, a bottle of wine, plus tip).  We probably would have been much happier if we had just ordered the wine and a pizza!  However, I must say that my experiences at the Eastway Drive location have been much better - the food is better and overall the service is much better (even though I don't particularly like that area of town -especially at night).",

I'm not saying it's the best Italian I've ever had, but it certainly ranks up there as far as Charlotte goes.  After living in New York for two years, I arrived in Charlotte less than satisfied with the pizza choices.  Portofinos comes CLOSE to having a perfect New York slice of pizza.  I say CLOSE because the cheese and sauce are deliciously tangy, with the perfect amount of spice and sharpness.  The crust is also delicious, and you can tell hand made.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the crust is a bit thick. I think they could make it a bit thinner and truly have a winner.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting, their pasta dishes are excellent and their house dressing is TO DIE for. It's a cross between a Thousand Island and a French dressing.  If you're craving Italian, this place won't let you down.",

    "text": "Overpriced for what you get, a clear \"southern American\" style of Italian food--which is to say it is greasy, over salted, and (I suspect) frozen.  1) My date and I chose the \"balsamic vinaigrette\" dressing with our salad, but there was no vinaigrette to it--it was pure balsamic vinegar.    2) The chicken parmigiana was overly crusty along the edges and the breading did not flake off easily--indicative of pre-pared and frozen before reheating in the kitchen.  The capellini were good, al dente.  However the breasts were EXTREMELY greasy from either excess oil or poor quality cheese on top (which by the way, was hard to discern).    3) The arrabbiate was over powered by the salt.  I understand it contains proscuitto (which is usually thin-sliced by the way, not chunky), but the salt dominates all competing flavor from the tomatoes, olives, garlic and basil.  A sure sign of poor quality food! Also, I requested broccoli with the arrabiate.  The server replied \"of course.\"  No broccoli.  4) The cappuccino needs to be removed from the restaurant.  I understand Charlotteans are no Europeans, but the cappuccino is obviously made from instant mix.  I asked the waitress if she made it with an espresso machine and she replied \"yes, we have an espresso machine.\"    5) The only saving grace was the bread, which was served warm and soft.  One piece of bread is too small for two people, so you have to ask for more.  I'll go to Maggiano's for future frozen Italian food, at least they have white table cloths to match the inflated menu prices.",

After reading other posts on here, I already knew I wanted the zuppa de pesce entree. First she brought me bread. It was warm but not great. But I ate more than I should. A house salad came with my meal which was perfectly sized and had nice flavor. The house dressing, a creamy tomato-basil dressing, was delicious!  My meal arrived and my eyes about popped out of my head! It was HUGE and loaded with seafood! Overall it was a somewhat healthy meal as it had a marinara sauce and linguine with even more seafood! Needless to say, I brought home a box and hope it'll be half as good reheated! I'm do glad I ventured out on this crappy night to try Portofinos! I'll definitely be back!

When I got home, I opened the lid to the pasta - parsley...not as much as what was on the garlic bread, but noticeable. The garlic bread was covered in it. I called today and spoke with the manager Geosh/Josh. I explained what happened and he said come on in and they would take care of it.      I went in tonight, spoke to him & he said \"oh yeah, I remember the garlic bread. It had a lot of parsley on it.\".... Really? So you were still going to send it out? And he insisted he hadn't put any parsley in the dish. It looked as though the dish had been made and whomever expedited the dish put some on it, saw the mistake, brushed what they could off, flipped the pasta upside down and added parm to cover it up.         If I was the owner, I would be embarrassed at what transpired. They charged me $7.59...& I got no garlic bread. REALLY? Last time I checked, when something, ESPECIALLY TO GO FOOD, is made incorrectly - you fix it. You don't \"kindly\" charge them for the dish they screwed up in the first place!

We prefer the pastas and pizzas, with good noodles and quality crust. The salad and bread the accompany the entrees are also excellent. We typically don't even need and appetizer and have plenty of leftovers to take home (not often the case for us elsewhere!). I have yet to try dessert because I've been so full after my meal but look forward to doing so. This spot makes you forget you're in a strip mall and is great for a date night, family outing, or celebration. Lunch prices are especially good.",

The chicken was super tender and delicious, the eggplant was a tasty way to get in some veggies, and the pizza was just the right amount of crispy and chewy. Our waiter, Gary, was fun, attentive and helpful. Thanks for a very enjoyable experience.   One note about parking: during busy times, parking can be tough because the small lot serves lots of businesses. It's worth a little bit of frustration, though, so just wait for someone to leave the grocery store and take their spot!",

    "text": "Portofino's is the kind of restaurant I can get behind. A small local chain with great food, equally great staff, and a warm and inviting atmosphere. I've ate there twice and both times were good experiences. Their food is hearty and filling and a notch above anything I could concoct in my kitchen. The chicken portofino has everything Italian food should in my opinion, alot of well seasoned tender meat, rich creamy sauce, and a huge helping with enough for leftovers. The shrimp parmigiana isn't quite as perfect, but I still enjoyed it and like that they use really fresh jumbo shrimp. Kudos for their tomato sauce too, some places have a tendency to make theirs overly sweet, but Portofino's keeps their sauce a little tangy, just as a tomato should taste.  I feel that great service can make average food subconsciously taste better, but luckily the quality of their food and service shine through in both areas. Their staff is superbly friendly and they come by frequently to check on things. They clearly want you to have a great meal, and as you can probably tell by my review, I like Portofino's quite alot. Skip the 45 minute waits at Olive Garden and come here, you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face.",

We got there at about 11:45 and I'm glad we did, because as we were leaving there was a line out the door... That must say something for this restaurant!  The sever was really quick to get our drink order and to take our meal order once she brought our drinks.  She told us about three lunch specials that all sounded delicious but I decided to order off the menu.  I ordered a side salad to start out with Witt he house dressing and the shrimp scampi for my meal.  One of my coworkers ordered the chicken and vegetable lasagne that was one of the lunch specials and my other co- worker ordered the linguine pasta with arrabbiata sauce.    Our side salads were delicious and very fresh!  I loved that they put green olives on the salad...different but good (if you like olives)!  The house dressing is really good and tastes even better with the warm bread they bring with your meal!  The shrimp scampi was probably some of the best I've ever had!  I chose the linguine as my pasta choice and it was perfectly al dente!  The shrimp were huge and fresh!  I could only eat half my meal and it was still good the next day reheated!  My coworker offered me a bite of his lasagna...now I see what everyone was talking about in the previous reviews!  Amazing!  It must be on special a lot and I could see why!  My other coworker enjoyed his dish as well (he ate it too fast for me to swipe a bite)!  All in all I love Portofino's and can't wait to go back again!!",

My wife ordered Gorgonzola Chicken which was probably the best dish at the table but still sub par to what I've had in the past. The waiter kindly asked the chef to make Chicken Francese for my daughter (it's her favorite food) which they kindly agreed to do but unfortunately it came out extremely dry and didn't taste anything like Chicken Francese other than someone squeezing some lemon juice over the top of it. My daughter who normally eats two servings at home took only a single bite and didn't touch it again. I'm hoping I had a bad experience as the service was delightful and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great but the food was not anywhere close to being as good as I expected.",

I appreciated that especially since it was my first time and they have tons of tasty dishes to pick from. We put in an order for some mozzarella sticks and after a quick recommendation from our waitress and some questions I finally opted for the Shrimp Scampi with linguini.   The Food:  Mozzarella Sticks: Classic. They arrived hot and crispy and the best part was that yummy homemade marinara sauce.   Salad and Bread: The salad was really good. It comes with topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and green olives. The bread loaves are tossed in the oven fresh every time before they come out to the table. Be warned those things are so addictive.   Shrimp Scampi: Huge shrimp sauteed in a delicious scampi sauce and a heaping portion of linguini. Who could ask for more? Mmmm...more please!   If I had room for dessert I would have tried to squeeze it down but that just wasn't happening. But they trick you because they bring out a tray with all the selections on it and they all look sooooo good. Next time....one of them will be mine!!!!  Three and a half hours later...Amy and I left stuffed and happy! I'm definitely looking forward to my next trip here!",

I have discovered I don't like NY style pizza- crust on pizza should be crisp & I hold it's shape- chewy doughy crust is gross in my humble opinion- but thats just the southern in me.  Anyway onto the experience: 3 stars- Were immediately greeted. the restaurant is nicely decorated although I felt teh entrance was to cluttered and a little boxed in. teh girl who seated us had a half smile and although was very nice and seated us in a decent place she just didnt seem geniunely pleased to be there.  2 stars- Our waitress came right over and greeted us and let us know she would be right back to get our drink order. When she came and we all ordered water with lemon she seemed a little irritated that we did not order something charge worthy.   3 stars- We pondered over the menu trying to deciede if we were all going to get a pizza or order entrees. So while ponderig some more we order the Calamari- I am a huge fan of calamari and have eaten it in every place that offers it. Next she brings the bread basket and plates. there is no traditional oil and vinegar on the table so we asked for it. but discovered later that there was little butters in the bottom of the basket- nice to know once we almost finshed the bread.  2 stars- calamari comes and is enough for 2 but not 3 people. the breading was light and very bland! no seasoning AT ALL. the ring parts were super chewy! either old or previously frozen or maybe just over cooked. we added lemon to it that didnt help enough but adding salt did help a littlebit. the marinara itself was just fine- although olvies gross me out andi have a huge tomato end piece that was a little green. i also added a bit of red pepper flakes to the marinara which seemed to improve it! and I ate it on my bread so the marinara gets 3 stars!  3 stars- we ordered the montese pizza. now ive had proscuitto before but there was just something strange about this. it was sour tasting and EXTREMELY salty and very tough. i dont kno if it was the brand or not sliced thin enough or maybe have 3 slices together on each pizza slice or maybe every being baked made it so unappetizing. i only ate one piece of pizza. the 3 stars is only because hubby and daughter liked it ok, but were not jazzed about it.  overall experience is a 3 i guess. lets just say I was so hoping for the authentic flavors I would get when at my Italian (not a NEW YORK ONE but the real deal who barely spoke English and was here from Naples Italy about 2 years before opening his on place) brother in laws restaurant back in the 90's near my hometown.  dont know if we will return but definately wont get the pizza next time",

I love this place everything here is amazing but my go to meal options are the chicken and veal parmigiana (I prefer the veal), great pizza, and I love the stromboli as well as the mozzarella sticks. The house dressing for the salads is also the way to go, delicious.  You truly get your money's worth here the portions are HUGE.  The HIDDEN TREASURE here is the philly cheese steak the best one I have had in Charlotte. (picture coming soon as in the next time I go)",

    "text": "If you don't want to read a story: go anywhere else if you value your hard-earned money- this was the most disappointing expense of $70 I have had in recent memory- and I frequently Amazon Prime while drunk.  Portofino's disappointed me in a way I haven't been disappointed by a restaurant in a very long time. I enjoy a 'greasy spoon'-styled restaurant/diner of any kind- there's a time and a place for a big, crazy burger and huge plate of fries or onion rings and I love the brusque service of a mom-and-pop joint that puts out great food. I want my servers at places like that to not come and think \"What else could he want?\" with confidence, and know my answer would be \"Nothing, this is everything I was looking for.\"   What I didn't expect when visiting Portofino's was a verbatim translation of that to a low-tier Italian restaurant, and it frankly will ensure I never recommend this location to anyone.  The positives:   A Sangiovese-Cab blend I wanted with the meal was sold out, the bartender (via our server) recommended a substitute Super-Tuscan at an identical price point. It was at perfect temperature and opened up flawlessly for exactly what I was looking for from the bottle I earlier preferred. This restaurant does not employ a sommelier, but this was the mark of a bartender who knows their wine. I come from a wine sales background and have a very solid understanding of my regions and grapes, so for the recommendation to be this close to what I was seeking told me very good things. The wine turned out to be perfect- and the only redeeming factor of a $70 dinner.  The hostesses were keen to seating us quickly during the dinner rush and I noticed their attentiveness to leap to action in seating larger groups by merging tables and adjusting seating with lightning-speed.   The house salad dressing is good. Not the salad- but the dressing. Their angel hair pasta is good.  The cons?:  The atmosphere was unfortunate. After waiting 7 minutes for our table, my girlfriend and I were seated in the most poorly positioned and tiny table in the building- ensuring we would be passed on both sides by staff moving food into the dining room and outside. With a sizable table this is a non-issue, but given the large plates and unnecessary accoutrements stationed on the table, along with our order of a bottle of wine, two glasses, the oversized menus, a poorly spaced wine list that could be a single page in lieu of a bound book- we were already struggling to properly apportion the table before those items arrived. This table simply should not exist in the workflow of the restaurant, it serves strictly to increase total head count by two. I understand during a busy dinner rush as it's more important to put the people in their seats than to have them milling about in the lobby, but other 4-seat tables were filled by groups of two against a wall in lieu of being in direct egress of the kitchen and dining room. I was left with the impression I was expected to be in and out as quickly as possible and simply 'filling a seat' versus 'dining in their restaurant'.  Service was just poor. It spoke volumes that the most attentive member of the staff to my girlfriend and I was a young man who was not our server, nor anyone's server, and may have been a busboy that ensured we finally received attention from a server after waiting at our new table for the better part of 10 minutes. Our server was conversational and friendly, but hardly attentive- we spoke with her exactly 5 times, two of which were her ensuring we had left a card for payment while we finished our wine. After relocating from our anemic and uncomfortable table indoors to one outside (a request which was met by a brusque departure and no further attention for a further 10 minutes after being re-seated by the hostesses) we placed our orders with hope the food would speak for itself.  50 minutes after walking in, our salads were weak, supported only by the heft of their dressings. My veal marsala was utterly mushy- it had the texture of a McDonald's burger patty and no crust or browning to speak of with perhaps the most egregious error being the literal pool of red/brown grease it and my pasta sat in that tasted nothing of marsala wine and broth as it should, but instead of the remnants of boiling a veal cutlet in butter and lard poured onto a plate, as I suspect was what happened. Seasoning was nonexistent, and this dish was very much inedible, as I have developed an unfortunate case of acid reflux since. My girlfriend's tortellini alfredo reminded us of a bagged pasta we had purchased on sale at the grocery store months before doused in a wimpy saucing that had nothing to offer for texture or depth.  After leaving significant amounts of food on the plates, the best part of our meal was the wine and a busboy's attentiveness. Yelp describes a one-star as 'Eek! Methinks not.' Yep, sounds spot-on. At least Amazon sends things promptly and as I expected them to arrive.",

I feel like I have to get that out of the way because Italians are some of the most opinionated foodies I've ever met in my entire life and HEAVEN FORBID I say something ignorant about their cuisine. So here is a review from a born and raised southern gal with an appreciation for  all things that come in marinara sauce:  I really like Portofino's. I had the luck of working in the same shopping center as this particular location and it quickly became my go-to for my lunch (great specials) and dinner options. I can tell that this is much closer to an authentic style of food than a lot of other mainstream Italian places and it has definitely helped me to refine my expectations.   All of their pasta dishes are phenomenal (OH- and as an added bonus- a New Yorker Italian friend of mine said that this was the best pasta he's had in Charlotte- so take his word if you have to). I also really enjoy their pizzas (the white pizza with spinach is perfect). The only thing I wasn't crazy about were their sandwich options- but I didn't spend my time trying to familiarize myself with this portion of their menu like I did everything else.   Good food. Super quick with orders to go. I would give 4.5 stars but apparently that's not an option.",

Don't worry that this is in a strip shopping area & if it's a nice evening sit on the patio!  Oh, we were oh so happy here!  Italian food is a staple for us like so many people and thank you Yelp community for all the reviews.  I really enjoy finding new restaurants & places to go through Yelp!  We sat on the patio...it's right off the parking lot, but they've really insulated it from most noises with the landscaping & you rarely even notice anyone walking by and we sat on the side closest to parking!  The patio is quiet, cozy & intimate with a fountain that adds a wonderful ambiance.  (I will make a quick note here to parents...please....restaurants are not places for your children to explore/play in)  The pasta dishes: Boscaiola 11.95 With prosciutto bits and fresh peas in a creamy pink sauce, wonderfully smoky and the Linguini was perfectly cooked and the Chicken Gorgonzola 15.95 Chicken breast sauteed with garlic and mushrooms in gorgonzola cream sauce...YUMMY!  My sweetie doesn't like gorgonzola, but it was done so well with a light touch that he enjoyed a bit or two!  It was nice they brought around the dessert tray for us to see!  We chose to split the Italian Rum Cake!  It is served chilled and it was a light and lightly sweet, wonderful end to the meal.  I didn't realize there were 4 of these restaurants in town... but I'm not surprised!  Our server was Sophia and she was just wonderfully friendly and bright and charming...she's a keeper!",

Don't be fooled by the shopping center, the place is quite spacious and they have a lovely patio. After some wine and chatting at a friend's house, we headed over to Portofino's for a late dinner. It was perfect, because when we got there, there was no wait and the weather was perfect for dinner on the patio (although it was a bit dark, they could use a couple more patio lights).  Our server was friendly and attentive. He gave us some time to look over the menus and didn't rush us. The menu is pretty diverse, with all kinds of options, and I definitely had trouble narrowing it down (I knew I wanted pasta, but wasn't sure what kind of sauce, all the choices looked great!). I finally just asked him for a recommendation, and he recommended the bascaiola. It sounded great and I couldn't make up my mind, so I ran with that (on top of penne). The restaurant was also super accommodating to my friend who is gluten free, and made her a special risotto (the special of the day was a veal risotto and she didn't want veal, so they took their chicken sorrento and subbed risotto for capelleni).   Our meals came with bread basket and salad. The salad was basic, and was the perfect size for a starter (a tad too many carrots). The bread was warm and crusty. My pasta was delicious; the sauce had great flavor, there was a ton of prosciutto and peas, and the serving was huge. I actually just ate some of the leftovers for lunch, and it was still just as good the next day!  I'm definitely adding Portofino's to my go-to list.",

    "text": "You know how after you eat something not very good--you're angry you wasted calories?  I'm very sorry to say my husband and I both felt that way after tonight's take-out from Portofino's.   Let me preface this review by saying...I RARELY give 2 stars.  I always feel if it's a locally owned establishment, it deserves a few tries. But unfortunately, just based on food alone, this dinner deserved the low rating.   The restaurant had a 45 minute wait on a Friday night, so we got a large Margherita pizza and some chicken parmesan to go.  We tore into the paper bags and the pizza box, and to our surprise...the pizza had completely MELTED.  We hadn't tipped the box or shifted it in-transit at all.  It was flat and pretty still sitting on the floor of the car.  Cheese was everywhere.   Oil was seeping from the box.  Not just a little oil seepage, but the Exxon-Valdez had just spilled and permeated the box.  That takes a heck-uv-a lot of oil to penetrate a thick corrugated pizza box.   I was starving, and ate two of the massive slices.  They weren't bad...I mean the flavor was there (this is not really all that authentic tasting...since there was no fresh mozz on the pie at all) but again, my mouth was coated in grease after each bite, and honestly, had I not been so hungry, I would have thrown it all away.   Actually, after that, we threw everything away.   As for the chicken parm, we were underwhelmed.  It was forgettable.  No distinct flavor, just the standard chicken parm. The breadstick that was just leftover dough, twisted into a shape and baked.  It could have passed for a bloated pizza crust.   I could knock on it..like knock-knock-breadstick...  The salad, was equally as weak.  Romaine lettuce, red onion rings, shredded carrots, green olives...there was nothing special about this salad.  In fact, it was a bit wet as if someone didn't spin the salad spinner long enough after washing.  The dressing one Yelper called \"amazing\"-- was a creamy orange nothing.  It added nothing to the salad.   GAHH!  I'm so mad at this meal...just writing about it makes me frustrated!   The price, over $30 with tax...and frankly, after I told my co-workers, two of them said \"Why did you go there?\"--one guy said the pizza was made from a pre-formed pizza shell.  (Not sure if this is True...) Another woman told me, for the money, you could get TWO pizzas at another joint 5 minutes away.   Sigh.  I'd like to be fair and try this place again...but after the oil slick in my stomach right now, I think I'd rather not.",

There were a lot of people there and that really added to the atmosphere.  Our server was awesome.  He was a super nice guy, had the authentic Italian accent, and was on it all night.  We began our meal with plenty of delicious wine, alongside a a plate of fried calamari.  It was a little bit undercooked and under seasoned for me.   I opted for the special, the surf n turf.  The lobster tail was cooked perfectly.  It was so so good.  I haven't had that good of lobster in a long time.  It came with a ribeye steak, which was cooked great also.  The only down side for me was that it was probably only a 1/2 inch steak.  When I get a steak, I want thickness.  It's the only way to get that beautiful chargrilled outside with that perfect pink inside.  I would definitely recommend this one to friends.  My one caveat was the drive, so next go around I think I'm definitely going to have to check out the original location, off of eastway.  Originals are always the best.  Am I right?",

I asked for a red blend and was offering a fantastic Italian Cab Sauv/Sangiovese for a reasonable $6/glass.  The place looks clean but I did see a fruit fly or two around my meal and table.  Service was very fast (so fast my friend \"complained\" her food was TOO hot!) and attentive.  I had the zuppi de pesce. I asked for no squid but it was still on my plate. Normally most place cannot cook squid well and it was confirmed here. Sliced with skin and rubbery with a too salty flavor that tells me not only was it old but overcooked. However the sauce was very tasty, pasta was al dente n the rest of the seafood cooked well - although the mussels were a little briny.  I also got to try a chicken dish with an amazing white cream sauce prosciutto and I think peas. A little jealous I didn't get this dish!  Did not visit the restrooms or the bar area. Four stars for the seafood snafu, but I'd go as high as 4.5",

I always pleased was pleased with my meal.  The chicken Parmesan is always consistently good.  Delicious thick Parmesan cheese on top and tasty sauce that's not sweet or bitter.  Today I ordered the cheese tortilini from the providence and it was amazing.  I had the exact cheese sauce on a pasta dish some months ago at an Italian restaurant near University City.  I missed that sauce son bad although the chicken was tasteless.  Portfolio has that same sauce and the dish itself was delicious to be meatless.  The pricing was fair for what I wanted.  Next time I won't be so skeptical to try some new.  The service is quick and a good use of space inside.",

I think that's what it's called? It has red sauce and mushrooms  They have great house salads and really really good bread, like really really good.

As we entered the restaurant, the hostess was figuring out where to seat the patron in front of us. Martino, the head server/waiter came over and asked will that be two for dinner? Would you like the patio or inside? The hostess came back and wanted to seat us near the entrance and we said no. We ended up with the table after the one by the entrance area.  Here is my review for the food and the service at Portofino's.  Ordered two appetizers  Fried Calamari- lightly breaded and fresh even the sauce was delicious. Not greasy or overly fried.  Roasted Peppers and Mozzarella- The mozzarella was fresh and roasted pepper were sweet.  Salad  Asked for a Cesar Salad with Anchovies and they made it to our specification. This is definitely impressive. Most places serve only what is listed on the menu.  Entrees  Rock Salt fish with Shrimp and Linguini- My friend enjoyed his meal.  Veal Saltinbocca Ala Romana- Prosciutto with melted mozzarella on top of veal which was so flavorful and tasty. Would have preferred the spinach to be on the side instead of on top of the veal.   Dessert  Homemade Tiramisu with a cup of cappuccino. Delicioso! Got my sugar fix for the rest of the evening.  This is definitely an authentic Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "Portofino's is definitely the neighborhood Italian go to for us! My boyfriend and I have gone here several times and it never fails to please. It is the type of Italian food that both Italians and non-Italians will appreciate because of the genuine taste. I'm very particular about my Italian food (because no ones ever beats my mother and grandmother's cooking) but they have the foundation of great food starting with their gravy (red sauce), warm atmosphere, and the generous portions they give you.  Every time I come to Portofino's I get the eggplant parm (since it is one of my favorite dishes) and a Lady Cello cocktail. I can rarely finish the entire entree in one sitting, and if I do I need to practically be rolled out. I am pretty sure they use an entire eggplant and marry it with gravy and cheese galore. Talking about this makes me want to sneak to the fridge and take out my leftovers.... ;)   Though I stick to my tried and True eggplant parm, my boyfriend has worked his way through at least half of the menu at this point and it has all been great. His personal favorite is the shrimp parm. You will always get freshly baked bread with your meal and a lot of dishes come with a  side salad, and for that I totally suggest the house dressing!!   The environment is always casual and laid back. Some nights the dinner rush causes a bit of a wait, especially on the weekends, but we have never had to wait too exceptionally long. The service is not always five star but we have never had any significant issues and everyone has always been friendly. The quality of the Italian feast you get makes up for the sometimes slow service.   Know going in that this is not a high dollar environment and they are not aiming to wow you with white linens and crystal, however they do want you to get a real feel of what Italian food can truly bring you: an insanely full stomach, comfort, warmth, wine, cocktails, laughs, and a casual place to enjoy your family and friends. That's what Italians are all about. :) Try it out!",

    "text": "On Friday evening, we stopped in for dinner. This was our first time at the restaurant. As there was a small wait we sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine. The male bartender was frantically running around and being very quick and short with the customers. This made for an uncomfortable experience.   We each ordered a glass of wine and a water. As he sat my glass of wine down in front of me, he accidently set it on the table pager which caused the glass to fall over. Luckily, I caught the glass and only a small amount of wine spilled on the counter and into my water glass. If I had not caught the glass of wine, it would have spilled all over the gentleman next to me. The bartender did not apologize, refill the spilled wine or replace the water glass with wine in it,  but he did say '\"Thanks for saving my butt\".   Once seated for dinner the rest of the staff continued in the same rushed manner. The table bussers were throwing plates around creating a very loud atmosphere and another came running in the back door, tripping and spilling an entire bread basket almost on top of me. He did not apologize, but the patron at the table next to me did ask if I was alright.   Our waiter was very attentive and the food was delicious. So although, we did not have the best dine-in experience we thought we would give it another try on Sunday with take-out as we were looking for our new go-to pizza spot. We ordered a large pizza and salad online, drove 15 minutes to pick up and when we arrived were told it was at the Ayrsley location, which is 20 minutes from your store and 35 minutes from our house. When we asked if we could cancel that order and place one with your store instead we were told \"yes, but that you would need to recharge us as it is a separate owner.\" There was zero concern on the restaurant staffs end for the inconvenience and not one suggestion for resolving the issue.   We called the Ayrsley location and explained what happened and the man on the phone demonstrated exceptional customer service and offered to refund the money.   We told the Park road staff about that and pointed out that this was our second time at the location in 3 days and that it seemed silly to be treating us this way and losing our business over $23.00. At this point the staff said \"We can make the food, but it's not our fault\".   We do understand the misplacing of the order was not their fault, however, the lack of customer service shown on both Friday and Sunday is.   I called to speak with the manager today to discuss the situation and again was met with poor customer service and a lack of concern for the situation.  This was truly a missed opportunity for the restaurant, had it been handled properly this could have resulted in a customer for life. Instead, we will not be returning.",

We were introduced to the restaurant from our friends because the owners are from NJ and to find good pizza here was impossible. But we were just recently there and ordered takeout and we got 2 large cheese pizza and I got the chicken saltimbocca over spaghetti it must've been an off night because the chicken was super dry to the point I couldn't eat anymore and the pizza was over cooked but the crust was too chewy . Usually I have no complaints but I was so disappointed and not to mention the money we spent on 2 pizzas and a meal and I couldn't finish the meal ugh but that still won't stop me from going back. Restaurants are allowed an off night just hope next time around it will be much better!",

Their marinara sauce is particularly tasty (is that a strong olive flavor in it?  I can't pick it out).  Prices and portions are on par with other restaurants in the area, which is to say \"low\" and \"more than adequate,\" respectively.  I've had the pizza twice.  It was never anything to write home about, merely average; why they are frequently cited as having some of the best pizza in Charlotte is beyond me (maybe the best of a mediocre bunch).  The staff at the Park Road location have always been efficient and professional... though they frequently look less than thrilled to see us, and hostess sometimes looks on the verge of yelling at me while seating me.  Don't let that put you off, though.  I've only eaten there maybe five times so far, but I've never been displeased.  This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants in Charlotte, especially if you ignore the chains (most of which are crap anyway).",

I recommend just ordering a small pizza rather than a slice at lunch because they do have some good darn pizza. I have tried multiple toppings including green peppers, olives, shrimp and have loved them all. I also have enjoyed their specialty pizzas too.  Note: I do order my pizza extra crisply. That way the dough is cooked just right and the crust is a little crispy! As for their entrees, you cannot go wrong with anything they offer. They have a variety of specials every night, but if you want to stick with a standard I recommend the Chicken Parmigiana, Shrimp Scampi (expect a garlic flavor) or the Meat Ravioli.  Service is always spot on, from the hostesses, bartenders, waiters and wait staff. Portofino's is my go to spot for good Italian and great prices in Charlotte.",

Something made us think of it, and we decided to head down to Charlotte to give this one a try and be a bit nostalgic.   We opted for an early dinner and went around 5. The place wasn't very busy but definitely was getting busy when we were leaving. We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly but seemed a bit scattered.   We got the affettato for an appetizer which is basically just Italian meats and cheeses. It was tasty. For entrees we split the florentina pizza which had pesto, spinach, chicken, and ricotta. Tasty, but could have used more ricotta. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Stromboli. We got sausage and pepperoni. This thing was huge and delicious. My mom also got the Gorgonzola pasta, which she said she loved.   The pizza is good, not great but the Stromboli and calzones are awesome and huge. Also their meat and cheese appetizers (they have a few) are very good. It's actually rather inexpensive, especially for the portion sizes. We'd definitely be back if it was closer to home, but it was quite tasty and a good experience overall.",

They have so many options, and we haven't gone wrong with anything we've had there before.   We were with another couple and decided to skip appetizers since we knew how much food was coming our way. The other couple ordered a \"small\" white pizza and cheesy bread. The pizza was much larger than expected and neither of them left hungry. I didn't try it but they said it was very good. My boyfriend got the old try and True, chicken parmesan with angel hair pasta and he left with a clean plate (completely stuffed). I chose to go with the stuffed eggplant which was an eggplant rolatini stuffed with ricotta cheese and ham and it was very very good. The sauce used here is more of a sweet sauce, which is different than what I'm used to but it tastes very fresh and I would prefer that over canned sauce any day.   The service was great, the food was hot, delicious, and very reasonably priced and I will most definitely be back again.",

I went with my father-in-law and husband after the PGA championship.  We ordered a meat and cheese plate for appetizer, the chicken fettuccine to split, and my father in law got the veal marsala.  Our service was excellent and so was all of our food!  Our waitress brought out bread, vinegar, and oil to start.  We will always come back to portofinos!",

The restaurant wasn't too crowded and there were enough waiters around every table. We went directly for the entree or Pasta to be specific. I got some Bolognese with Fettuccini which came with a Salad and Bread. Our waiter was very happy to fill up the Bread as soon as we finished it. The Salad came in and I was not thoroughly impressed with it - looked more like already prepared and the lettuce wasn't so fresh. The main dish came in -  Bolognese, the meat and sauce were mild and alright. I wasn't too impressed with the dish but it wasn't a let down too.",

We brought our own wine, and thy do charge a $9 cork fee, which is better than most places.  My dining companion remembered the place as being cozier, but the lights are pretty bright.

After Frankie's on Morehead closed, and we moved too far from Ciro's in University City, I didn't realize how much I missed the joyous, casual, celebratory spirit that is unique to the Italians: gioia della vita!  Portofino's delivers.  We reserved a table for six in the corner and raised our glasses to life's blessing last night.  The place was slammed and our waiter never missed a beat.  Thank you!  All the food was very good, and my son's large calzone--wow!  Monstrous.  We joked it looked like a large pizza had fallen out of the oven and they folded it over and served it as a calzone.  Humungous. Understandably, he took 2/3 of it home.  In fact, we ALL took food home; Portofino's is generous with their portions.  And fine on the wallet, too.  An absolute repeat, especially when it comes to family celebrations!",

We were told when we called earlier in the week there was NO reservations on Mothers Day.  But the Manager was very accommodating to us and found a place for us to sit, we were divided up but we had a huge party of 12 and two high chairs. So it is GOOD Italian food, large portions but good sauce and great salads. The House Salad dressing is great, a Tomato based, with basil and garlic. Salad is full of olives and onion and cucumber, a very nice house salad. I ordered two of the Appetizer trays for the two tables. I had the Veal Parmesan, with the tomato sauce on the side. It was two nice size pieces with a large helping of Angel hair pasta with red sauce. The Veal was crisply fried with a nice amount of Mozzarella. My husband had the Manicotti but in a Alfredo Sauce, it was delicious! Some of the other family members had the Tortellini and the Chicken Picatta . They brought around a dessert tray and I ordered the Chocolate Lava cake, that is the only disappointing thing we had. It was just like a small bundt cake but not any \" Lava\"  in it. Service was very good and it was a huge party, that was pleasing. I have been to a couple other Portifino's and they all have been good. Oh the Calzone is huge and stuffed full of delicious ingredients, I have to get one next time I go!",

Their calzones are humongous, and I would put their Sicilian pie up against anyone elses...try a Sicilian with no-cheese (or 1/2 without cheese if you're hell bent on it having it on there) with mushrooms and/or pepperoni....they'll add some fresh basil to it, and it's reminiscent of tomato pie/pizza bread from northern bakeries if you guys know what I'm talking about.   Their fried calamari is perfectly fried w/ marinara sauce and some hot bread to go along with it. Their bread is awesome btw...so good that I'd buy some standalone!! I'm partial to the casalinga pasta dish which is red sauce, peas and veal chunks....traditional spaghetti and meatballs is also good. ALERT - their sandwiches might be the best in town...the best cheesesteaks, the best hot Italian sub, the beast meatball marinara, the best veal/chicken parm....MADON!!!!! I'm pulling a homer and drooling as I type. 9 times out of 10 I get it to go - and actually prefer the Eastway shopping center location (I swear their prices are cheapr, but they have the same takeout menu so it can't be True). No one is claiming this to be the best upscale Italian restaurant in town...but it fits the bill perfectly for the aforementioned NY style Italian-American comfort food.",

The portions are large enough that you'll want to take half of your dinner home (and quickly devour it the next evening!).  It's kind of fills the same niche as the Olive Garden, but that's not really a fair comparison because Portofino's is more authentic and much tastier.  The service was impeccable.  Drinks stayed refilled and everything was served exactly when expected.  Our waiter was not only pleasant, but entertaining.  He actually seemed to be enjoying his job (imagine that!).  The place is small, but charming.  I imagine they have the draw to fill a larger space, and that would certainly cut down on the wait for a table.",

Average food, I can smoke these guys in my kitchen at home, but my kitchen was 500 miles away today. Big portions, I had the Chicken Taratino with Angel Hair Pasta $14.95. Weak side salad with dated ingredients. Yes, the meal was okay, but overpriced for the level of quality. The wine list was intriguing with all Italian wines. I had the Velenosi Brecciarolo 2002 and found it to be excellent. Great wine prices on wines you might not know about. It did irritate me that they serve wine in the small cheap wine glasses that only hold 3-4 ounces when not completely filled. My issue is price value. Lets stack it up, Mini shopping center location, good service, but very average food at somewhat inflated prices. They have Serv Safe Certification (displayed on the wall in the bar) which is is good. Big pizza carry out business. Pizza is cooked in a deck oven, so off to a good start.  I liked the service and the staff was friendly. This is not a BAM!...sorry!! See my other review for a serious Italian alternative in Charlotte.",

    "text": "After hearing good things about Portofinos for a while, I finally went last night with a group of friends.  Luckily, we went family-style, so we ordered a number of items from the menu - all amazing.  From the get-go, we were super hungry, so we ordered the Fiorentina pizza for an appetizer while we contemplated the rest of the (huge) menu.  I guess I didn't realize just how large 16\" is (there's a joke in there somewhere), but I was surprised by how big the pie was when it came out; the 6 of us dug in.  The flavor was a perfect meld of hot, cheesey, pesto-y goodness.  We then also ordered the chicken parmigiana, pasta sorrento, and pasta alla panna.  I know a lot of other Yelpers have said the chicken parm was their favorite, and while it was very good, I think the other dishes were incredible.  The pasta sauces were light but packed immense flavor and left me wanting 2nd servings, even though I was stuffed.  And we got the house white (pinot grigio) and house red (pinot noir), which were both very drinkable for $25.    The location (strip mall behind the Harris Teeter) leaves something to be desired, but once inside, you feel the love and atmosphere of Italy.  Our waitstaff was very attentive, and our server did an amazing job of splitting checks (no easy feat with bottles of wine, one pregnant lady, and someone else ordering a healthy salad on their own).  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "We went here for lunch the other day.  It was busy, and seemed like a lot of business people came here for lunch. I took that as a good sign, since they chose to come to Portofino's over several good options pretty close by.  Unfortunately, I don't agree with their choice.  Our waiter was friendly enough, kind of a low talker, but otherwise the service was fine. We had the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer.  It was good, though I would have real issues with a restaurant that could mess THAT up.  For lunch, I ordered the Ravioli special, my husband had a chicken parmesan sub and my mom-in-law had a salad with salmon and their house dressing.    My meal bordered on gross.  It looked like they had taken all of the different ravioli left over from dinner the night before, put them on a plate, then smothered them in a creamy basil sauce with way too many olives and roasted red peppers, so that they were unrecognizable.  There was way too much going on on that plate.  I like all of the things separately, but together, none of the flavors were distinguishable when it was all together.  There were heart-shaped mushroom ravioli, huge round meat-pie ravioli, smaller round cheese ravioli, and square sausage ravioli.  Doesn't that sound like whatever they had left over was what went on the plate?  The sauce was really gross looking: vomit-like in color and texture.    The salad looked fresh, and got reviews of \"good.\"  Jim's sandwich was good as well, though he said he would get something else next time.  The table next to us ordered pizza, which looked good.  I'll probably try that if we go back.  The other thing about Portofino's that I didn't like, was the noise level.  Normally in a restaurant, even a busy one, I can concentrate on our conversation and not hear others (unless I was trying :) ).  But this was a very loud lunchtime service, so I wouldn't recommend going there for a business meeting that you would like to pay attention to, or an intimate lunchtime date.",

I liked their pasta and the service was decent although the waitress could not understand most of what I asked and I couldn't understand most of what she said. But she was trying hard to make sure we were okay and that was nice. This place is over priced for the food quality and the menu which is pretty basic. If you're looking for value for money  I would look elsewhere.  I might go get their pasta again but not any time soon. I dont like places that try to be upscale but end up being only high end in their prices while the food quality and menu innovation remain stagnant.",

I have been here twice now for dinner, and the wait hasn't been too terrible. The service was good, considering how busy they were, and the food was good to very good.  During my most recent visit, I had the lasagna, which was very rich and large-portioned. I can generally eat a good bit, especially of Italian food, but that evening I had a nice bit to take home as leftovers.  My girlfriend at the time said the Tiramisu was very good as well.  Prices are maybe a bit higher than some other Italian restaurants in the area, but you get a lot of food for the money, so that's not a big deterrent for me.",

Now, I have nothing against good greasy pizza but do not be fooled people, this is not one of those. Come inside and be treated to a warm and cozy spot with paintings of Venice (I think) on the wall. The seafood dishes really are a fair deal, you can get pasta piled high with clams, shrimp, scallops etc for less than 15 bucks. The service was friendly, our water glasses were never less than half full. Even the creamy dishes were light and tasty. I guess my scampi was a bit less garlicky than I like, but it really wasn't much of a loss - it was quite delicious. I'll be back.",

I usually make my own pasta and do not order it out, but when I'm feeling lazy I do like Portofino's combination seafood (zuppe di pesce) in marinara over the pasta of my choice.

I have heard wonderful things about their antipasto, as well as their pasta, and those recommendations did not disappoint!   This spot is in an unassuming strip between the Harris Teeter and Lucky Lou's, but once you enter, you're transported to this slightly kitschy Italian oasis - trellis, grapevines and all. There's always an array of specials on the board, but I have yet to try them, even though they all sound delish. I never get past the pastas, because I know I'll be full and still have some for lunch! I've had their alfredo and marinara and both are great, but the clam sauce is amazing!! Not too garlicky, not too buttery, just the perfect amount of everything. Also, their antipasto might be the best in Charlotte. The amount of meats and veggies is disproportionate, but in a good way, there's plenty of meats and veggies! Even writing about it makes me want to go and order it right now.   Long review short....just go have some Italian here, you won't be disappointed!",

The house salad dressing is great for bread dipping.  The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the food is always delicious.  Popping in during the lunch or dinner rush shows that there are many likeminded patrons onboard with that statement.  The bustle of family and friends enjoying dinner conversation fills the four walls, yet I've never had to wait for a table.    I'd encourage you to try it for yourself.

    "text": "I was there at about 5:30 PM on Monday night for dinner. Sitting at the bar, President Trump was awarding Tiger Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom award, only the fourth golfer to receive such an award, on the television overlooking the bar.   Behind me and off to my right were four waiters making disparaging remarks about the president, remarks such as \"that buffoon won't shut up\", \"he is still talking isn't he\", and one of them was clearly heard saying that he wants to vote the far most leftist socialist candidate that he can find. We don't need to project how that's going to turn out, we have a live real world example of that called the failed socialist country of Venezuela.  Regardless of your views of the President, I do not believe that restaurant staff should be openly discussing politics in the presence of customers. I go there to eat dinner, not to be upset, which interferes with my digestion. I asked one of the staff members to please have the manager come over to speak to me, and he did, and he apologized. I suggested that he hold a meeting with the staff so they do not openly discuss politics in front of customers, regardless of their political views.  The old expression \"the customer is always right\" is correct. There are many fine restaurants in Charlotte, and I do not need to be subjected to this while I'm trying to relax after a hard day. I won't be going back there for quite a while, if ever. If the manager  would like to turn his restaurant into a debating society, that's his prerogative. But if he wants to keep attracting well-paying, smart customers, he would be wise to have this staff meeting.",

We judge everything by the calamari and their's is very good. (Still cannot compare to Royal II in Yarmouth, MA!) Our meals were delivered hot and the meats, sauces, bread, etc were all good. There is outdoor seating and it feels comforting inside. Great place for a date!",

The tomato sauce is flavorful; the crust has a homemade fresh taste and the sausage is great as well.    Also, their house salad dressing is amazing.  I would go back just for the dressing.  It's a creamy sundried tomato, garlic, mildly spicey dressing.  Yum.    We went today for Valentines and despite the consistent flow of people, the service was still flawless.    I really want to try something other than the pizza but I enjoy the pizza so much that I don't want to be disappointed.    Our bill for a side salad, medium pizza, garlic bread and a glass of wine was $25.....not bad!  Definitely give it a try (for pizza and a salad at least)!",

Yes, my grandmother is one of the best cooks in the world (major bias, I'm sure) but Portofino's throws down some damn tasty eats.  I stopped by Portofino's to catch up with a friend over a casual lunch. While their menu looked pretty enticing I went with their lunch special \"bake\": two jumbo stuffed shells, one manicotti, baked and covered in meat sauce. While I can't get grandma's cookin' in Charlotte, this was a very solid substitute! The shells and manicotti were perfectly cooked (not overly so) and stuffed with delicious ricotta. And the sauce - purty tasty too - although I would have been delighted with another manicotti and less sauce. But that's just personal preference!  The service was friendly and attentive and I never went without at least a half-full beverage. Plus, the prices are pretty affordable - my bake was $7.95. Not bad! I absolutely want to come back and try their 'za and maybe a whole tray of desserts. Nom!",

After receiving several recommendations for Portofino's, we finally got around to sampling their fare.  I ordered my standard Italian dish, lasagna bolognese, and my wife ordered a plain cheese pizza.  The lasagna was very good but that pizza?  Oh man, did I order wrong!  I could not stop asking her for just one more bite.  Be aware that this place is like a local version of a Carrabba's or a Macaroni Grill, only with MUCH better food and no cheesy artificial flair.  If you want a family friendly joint to serve up some great tomato sauce and cheese, this is the place.",

We arrived at about 1:30pm for lunch, which is sometimes an awkward time to eat at a restaurant; the lunch rush is over, the cook is ready to prep for dinner and the servers are ready for their shift to slow down! Fortunately, we were promptly seated at a great table outside by the fountain. Our server was pretty knowledgeable of the food and seemed to have actually tasted all of them. She couldn't quite pronounce gnocchi in the specials, but the food and service was so good it didn't really matter!  I had my \"usual\" the boscaiola with penne and their great side salad with house dressing. The dressing is very light, but delish. The bread is always warm and crusty (crusty good, not \"I wore these jeans 20 times before I washed them\" crusty). And that boscaiola sauce is like heaven on a plate!!! The peas! The prosciutto! The creaminess! It all comes together in an amazingly perfect way that leaves you wishing the plate had more than the 4 servings it comes with! BEWARE! You will want to eat all of it! Try to resist and take some home! I highly recommend adding some crushed red pepper flake to the sauce if you give it a go, adds a nice kick! My co-worker had the special portobello ravioli, planned on saving a couple to take home, but couldn't resist the deliciousness!  I highly recommend Portofino's. The food is great and even if the staff can't pronounce all of the food on the menu, they're all still great!",

We tried a tomato garlic salad dressing upon our waiter's suggestion and it was pretty good. We also tried the house Italian dressing which I found to have a distinct olive flavor to it which I didn't care much for - I don't like olives but usually this is not a problem with other dressings. We got hot bread included which was good - it was soft - very much like a Pillsbury french bread roll. For the entrees I got the Pasta Sorrento and he got the Veal Parmigiana. I liked my dish - he loved his. The portions were large - we both had about half of our food leftover. Overall, the service was very good and the food was good.

Like most sandwiches, the bread is what makes the difference.  It was right on point and perfectly toasted.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.    PS.  I just started at a new job and my co-workers thought they would haze me.  They forced me to finish the massive cheese steak in one sitting.  Little did they know, like the cow, I have a four chamber stomach and threw down that sandwich with some fries.  They brought their halves home in a doggy bag.  Enormous portion size!

Their pizza is MY FAVORITE in town, maybe anywhere - and I like me some pizza. I never even think to order anything but just cheese because it's so good and why mess with a good thing?  Their house dressing is awesome! I love getting the house salad to start off my meal (no onions, thanks). The bread is alright, not amazing, but good for dipping in sauce later.  Pizza - YES. Chicken Parm - excellent! Stuffed Shells or Manicotta - though not my favorite, delicious. Lasagna - yummmm. Penne Bolognese - YES YES YES. Baked Ziti - obviously.  I'm sure I've tried more, but those are the standouts as far as I'm concerned.   The wait is rarely long, even when they look slammed. The wait staff is always super nice. Our last guy was hilarious and had the best laugh I've heard in a while. Many of them have Italian accents, which I love for effect.   Decor isn't anything outrageous, but works for me. It's very pleasant and relaxed. Great spot to take the family or a date. (My dad hates going to Italian restaurants when he visits other cities, but makes an exception when he comes to Charlotte for Portofinos. Same with my mom.)

We had a group of 9 people set in the back of the first room.   We ordered the bruschetta, calamari, and mozzarella sticks for appetizers. The mozzarella sticks were my favorite, but the calamari was very good. I didn't get a chance to try the bruschetta, but it looked good. We also got bread that was served with butter, and if you ask they can give you olive oil and vinegar.   We were stuffed before our salads even came out. Luckily I got mine to go. I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini with chicken and added mushrooms. It was delicious! It was the first time I had ordered it, and I loved every minute of it. We at the rest the following night and it was just as good reheated, which is a big plus in my book.   My husband had a few remarks he wanted me to add to this review so the following is from him. His entree came with olives and he asked if they could be removed because he's not a fan of olives. When his salad came, he remembered he forgot to say no olives, which it typically comes with. Knowing that he did not want olives on his entree, the cooks took the olives off of his salad as well. HUGE WIN for the kitchen.   He ordered the trout special for his dinner. He was not a fan. The trout was breaded with marinara sauce on it. Not really his style, he thought it would have come pan fried with no breading and maybe a light butter sauce. Lesson learned, ask about cooking styles before ordering the special.",

The sauce tasted like water.  If I hadn't been at the restaurant with other people I would have given this place a one star, but the other couple I was with enjoyed their veal parmesan. just because you put a fancy name on a menu doesn't mean you know how to cook it and this is True with this place. There is more flavor in a jar of ragu then there was on this food. I suggest you try a different restaurant if you want good Italian food.",

    "text": "Having just moved to Charlotte, my husband and I knew that one of our first orders of business would be to find a solid family Italian restaurant. We both grew up in the Northeast, but have spent the past 4 years in Texas, and have really missed having a great standby Italian place.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Tuesday and were promptly seated. After looking at the extensive menu for a  bit, we ordered the Hot Antipasto for 2, I selected the Chicken Parmesan and my husband picked the Veal Saltimbucca, both entrees came with a choice of capellini or soup and a house salad. We both selected the capellini and salad with house dressing (I'd read a few other Yelp reviews that said the house dressing is the way to go - it was great!) I'm not sure exactly how to describe the dressing - it came out looking like Thousand Island - but tasted more like a creamy Italian with basil and garlic.  The Hot Antipasto arrived with 2 baked clams/clams casino, a generous pile of mussels, two delicious breaded shrimp, 2 stuffed mushrooms, and 2 eggplants rollatinis. The eggplant, shrimp and mussels were my favorite. The stuffed mushrooms weren't exactly what I was expected, just seemed to be mushrooms filled with ricotta cheese - but good nonetheless.  The salads promptly followed the appetizer and we both enjoyed the house dressing, as well as the salad, which included green olives, cucumbers, carrots, red onion and lettuce.  The entrees came out and were HUGE, my chicken was at least the size of my head. I don't eat veal so I can't comment on how the Veal Saltimbucca tasted, but \"wow\" and \"tastes like home\" were both uttered by my husband, so I think it was a big hit! I think Chicken Parm is a good dish to gauge an Italian restaurant from, and they did a great job. I think the chicken could have been a little thinner, but all in all it was a great meal, and it's always nice to leave with enough leftovers to make another meal out of it.  We'll be back for sure! They have a lot of really interesting dishes that I look forward to trying.",

It's not the fanciest restaurant but the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Great for when the family comes to town or just Wednesday night take out.    Very hard to go wrong as everything I have tried (and I've been more than 80 times) is  consistently good and large enough portions that my wife and I always split the entree. Our go to is Chicken Sorrento, angel hair pasta and an extra side salad with house dressing on both. Let me say a few words about the house dressing. I look for foods to put that dressing on it is sooo good. It's a creamy, tomato, garlic of some variety. Perfect for salad dressing or just dunking the homemade bread in.   Other favorites are the lasagna, the Chicken Portofino, the Chicken Parmesan, grilled Chicken Salad, the tomatoes with fresh mozzarella.  They also have a special house wine, Portofino Ripasso.   Of the 80 plus times we've eaten Portofino's, 85% have been take out orders mainly because we live so close but also because the food tastes just as good at home as in the restaurant.  Love this place!",

The sandy gritty salty dish was waived and he mentioned \"he had to charge me for the salad which was included in my inedible dish\". I was shocked at his pettiness.

If you have not eaten their \"Chicken Portofino,\" you MUST give this a try! OMG it is SOOOOOOOOOOO good. It's Chicken breast dipped in flour and sauteed with mushrooms, ham and onions in a cream sauce. That CREAM sauce is to die for! For those of you who know me, I'm a pretty darn good cook who's been taught how to make classic French sauces through my Johnson & Wales Chef Choice classes. Well this one is textbook cream sauce (though Italian not French). You can taste the butter and cream, and it makes this dish heavenly. I don't know how else to describe that taste. I've ordered this dish a dozen times before and each time it has been consistently prepared, and consistently AWESOME!  My date ordered their Osso Bucco special. She never had that before and she loved it! I tasted it and it was cooked to perfection. That slow braise did the trick. Super moist and tender, and very flavorful.  TIP: Ask for their \"Portofino House Red Wine\" and they'll bring you a Venetian Ripasso, which I call the \"baby Amarone.\" For $32 bucks you get an excellent bottle of red wine which drinks much better than the $32 price point....at least it does to my wine palate!  Just love this place. Hope you enjoy it as well!",

I was out & about today in the South Park area & just had to get my cheesesteak fix...& at the lunch price, no less!  I called my order in at 1:15 & was told it would be 15 minutes. I was at South Park Mall, when I called the order in, so I wasn't too far away. When I arrived at little before 1:30, my order was waiting for me. The restaurant was still a bit busy with the lunch crowd.  I headed on to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. It was neat to see a familiar face in one of the waiters. He had worked at the Mooresville location & of course remembered me as being a regular. :)   The man who rang my order up was very friendly.  And of course, again, I was happy about receiving a seven-inch cheesesteak & a bag of Lay's plain chips for less than $7.   The restaurant is a decent size & as Jeff S. pointed out, it's \"done up\" in Italian style, as you would expect.  They do have a separate bar area, that's set off from the main dining area.  When I got back to the house about 20 minutes later, the sandwich was still hot, thanks to being wrapped in aluminum foil. As hungry as I was, it didn't take much time for me to devour it.  Ohhhhh, it tasted just as good as I remembered! Thin, chopped up steak, with melted cheesy yumminess, & nice sized mushrooms.  I'll definitely be back...",

Shrimp wasn't smothered in mozzarella but each piece was covered just enough with it. And was delicious. Service was also great for a busy Sunday night. They have outdoor seating.",

We had the white pizza, eggplant parmesan, chicken parmesan, house salad, lasagna and a seafood pasta dish. All the meals were delicious and served hot from the oven. We had to wait a bit for the lasagna to finish cooking, but it was well worth the wait and the wine calmed our impatience.",

    "text": "I normally only get take out from here (which is always good!) but man was I pleasantly surprised when we actually went in to sit down and eat. We called ahead to put our name on the list since it seems to always be a popular choice, and ended up only waiting 10 minutes. Soooo... we got a glass of the Cabernet the bartender suggested- DELICIOUS!  For appetizers, we ordered the roasted red peppers and mozzarella and the \"appetizer for 2\" to share. A lot of food but full of flavor! I may add that their calamari is always a winner but we had to try something different for once :-)   For our entree, we split the chicken cacciatore that was served with a white wine sauce. Not sure if I'm wrong here, but I normally make this with a red wine marinara sauce. However, the sauce was absolutely delicious!!! A lot lighter than I typically expect but really good. (Even though we had to take majority of it home!)  Definitely get the house creamy basil dressing! Cant get enough of it.   I also want to add our server was really great. She was super patient with us taking a little extra time to order and splitting an entree. Also, I loved how attentive each and every staff member was to not only our table but each table individually.   Authentic food. Wonderfully sweet staff. And great family/date atmosphere! Great job Portofinos :-)",

    "text": "I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HYPS IS ABOUT!! I ordered a small cheese pizza that was lukewarm, and not cooked all the way. When I picked up a slice, the half melted cheese stuck on the surrounding side slices and I was left with crust and sauce. Not every day you order a cheese pizza and only get crust and sauce when trying to eat it. Not good. I also tried the  chicken parmesan which was very greasy and heavy, and sauce was bland.   I really thought I was going to have a great experience at Portofino's because of other reviews, but maybe they were having an off day.",

    "text": "Every now and then I just have to go gnab a big plate full of mollusks. The \"Scungilli and Calamari\" entree (evidently scungilli is Italian for conch) certainly delivers on that front. In addition to the plate reaching approximately to the South Carolina border, the pasta was utterly swamped in calamari rings and conch strips. I am pretty sure an entire reef's inventory of squid went into this dish. I certainly can't ding Portofino for skimping on the portions.  While I enjoyed the calamari, I was disappointed to discover that the conch was really rubbery and almost challenging to get through it all. Even though I just ate here last night, I really can't recall anything about the sauce, which tells you a lot about how interesting it must have been. Also, the salad went for the \"Titanic\" approach by seemingly having crashed into an entire head of Iceberg lettuce.  Nothing too exciting here, but Portofino is a nice little neighborhood Italian hangout where you can grab an enormous mound of decent pasta on the cheaps.",

    "text": "Nice place.  I've been twice, and the food is always good. The atmosphere is nice, too.  However, this time, there were supplies all over the place, as if they ran out of room or something.  I stared at two spray bottles of cleaner on the half-wall beside our table the entire time.  Kinda weird. The italian dishes are great, and they always have a few specials that are not Italian (steak, fish, etc.).  The prices are reasonable, too.   Their wine selection isn't the best, but it's not awful, and they're not marking the wine up 400% like most restaurants, either. The few times per year that I'm in the mood for Italian, Portofino's will definitely be in my top two choices.",

Mozarella was melted evenly and tasted very good.  The tomato slices on top were not too thick nor too thin.  Bartender was attentive and made sure to refill our drinks.
