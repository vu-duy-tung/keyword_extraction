I tend to order gluten free whenever I can and for the most part I usually have a pretty good experience, but Empire's was just OK. I wouldn't order it again if I had the opportunity, but it wasn't the worst. The rest of my group seemed to really enjoy their regular pizza so that is most likely what I'll have next time we come here.",

The fella and I visited early on a Sunday evening for dinner, and service was spot on. Unfortunately, they couldn't show us a draft or bottle beer list, so we sorta had to wing our choice.  We started with the pepperoni rolls, which were better than I expected. Then we moved onto spliting a 10\" Maui pizza (which was 6 slices) with bacon, ham, and pineapple. Somehow the marinara sauce that came with the pepperoni rolls tasted a lot better to me than the sauce on the pizza, which sorted tasted like tomato sauce out of a can, but even just okay pizza is pretty good.",

There is a really good energy to the place which provides a pleasant atmosphere for singles and families.  This is the sort of restaurant and bar where the staff gets to know you.  Thus, you will see several regulars having fun  visiting with each other and the staff.  Plus, a lot of folks love watching sporting events on the TVs.  It is often crowded on Thursday through Saturday nights.  Early Sunday evening is also busy.  In addition, the restaurant does a huge takeout business. So depending on the day and time, you should be prepared for a usually short wait to get a table.  I hope you will enjoy Empire as much as I do.",

There were several kids there and the place was pretty packed!  We LOVED everything we ordered - lasagna and 5 Boroughs pizza. We also ordered cheesy garlic bread for our son and it was delicious! The staff was very friendly and service was quick!  We would definitely recommend it! :D",

    "text": "To start off, my family and I have been to this location several times. Service is always sub par, but we are pretty forgiving because my husband and I work in the restaurant industry.  We understand that unexpected things can come up and not every server can be on point all of the time.  Our visit this evening, which will be our absolute last to this location, was beyond terrible.  The hostess had an attitude as if she hated that she was even there, which is a normal occurrence here.  She sat us in the loud bar area with our two young children.  Irritating, but I could see past that.  Our waitress, Brittany, took our drink order (4 waters) and returned with them 5 minutes later.  We then ordered a Sicilian Margherita pizza and some garlic cheese bread.  Simple. Someone else brought out our garlic cheese bread, which we ate unhappily with the lack of silverware, napkins, and plates.  By this time, my husband's water and my water were empty and sitting at the edge of the table, clearly visible.  Brittany didn't return until she dropped off our pizza which was actually a 16\" Margherita.  She conveniently picked up one of our empty water cups to take our empty appetizer plate, then set the empty cup back down.  She said, \"I'll be right back with plates.\"  Well, guess what? Those plates never came, nor did napkins or silverware. After quite a long time, I got up, walked to the back of the restaurant, and asked someone else for silverware, napkins, and plates.  She got me silverware (not to our surprise, one of the knives had some sort of sticker/paper crusted to it) and I grabbed my own napkins and plates from their stock.  On my way back to our table, I see Brittany in the server station at the front of the restaurant, ON. HER. PHONE.  Still, she hadn't come by our table since dropping off our pizza.  My daughter needed to use the restroom, so I took her.  We came back and my husband reported that Brittany STILL had not been back to our table.  Wow. She finally stopped back by and quickly asked if we were doing okay, then moved to her next table.  Still, no water or even the promise to get more.  She smoothly came behind me and dropped the check at the table, saying nothing. I have NEVER left a server without a tip, but I did tonight.  We left a note for Brittany as well saying we obviously were not a priority to her and that she had missed almost every step of service.  She never even returned to the table to pick up our check. Good thing we had exact change. On the way out, my husband asked the hostess if they were down a server or two and she said, \"No.\" My husband responded with, \"Really? Our server was killing it, and I mean that in a bad way.\"  Her reply was, \"Well, have a great night.\"  Either she was totally oblivious to what he was saying or she was standing up for the atrocious service we received. I wish I could say we were on Candid Camera, but unfortunately, this was real.",

Their marinara sauce is very good and a big fan of their calzones.  Service is usually pretty quick, can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights and, so you can expect to wait a little bit.

There is a bar on the other side of the partition and the noise doesn't really carry over to the dining area.  But you want to know about the pizza, right? Well, it's truly an experience. The sauce, crust and ingredients all come together to make a great pie. They've really put time into their recipe for the pies.The buffalo wings are great also.  Empire also serves Gyros, Pitas and other pizzeria items, although I haven't tried them, I've had some friends tell me they're very good. We been going to Empire often over the last 5 months and we've only had one experience where the pizza wasn't cooked all the way through, we didn't mention anything to the staff because it wasn't that bad.

Ordered and when she returned and threw straws on the table ... I knew. We are out!!' Left and didn't look back.  All the reviews said hit or miss on service. It's mostly miss. You've been warned.  (And PS...  Less is more when it comes to make up.)",

A smile and a thank you goes a long way.   I love the fact that you can order a pizza at midnight and pick it up.",

    "text": "I do not often give bad reviews, those have to be really earned. Today and the last couple visits have earned every word of this review. The experience starts with the hostess. The same hostess we had on our last visit. She did not say a single word on either visit. No hello, no welcome to Empire, no how many in your party, no good bye no anything. She didn't lead us to a table, hand us a menu or provide any value. Well there is the constant sour look on her face that our presence is a huge bother to her.   So we take a high top in the bar area. Note it is about 2:30pm and not busy. We wait and wait and wait. Making eye contact with everyone we can that works there only to have them look away. Then the waitress comes to the table next to ours. After taking their order she simply left even after seeing us there. All of this is 10 minutes with no menu, no water, no one giving a crap.   We got up, I asked the waitress who the manager was she asked where we were sitting. I told her the table she just looked at and walked away. She pointed out the manager who had previously  looked at us  and simply walked by. Seriously no one in the dining staff cares at all about the customer.   We normally go here 2 or 3 times a month as the cheese steak is that good but doubtful we will be back. Service has always been poor now it just down right stinks. Note the post above describes today but is similar to our last 2 outings there. Last time we got service but watched another table walk out as they couldn't get anyone on staff to acknowledge they were alive.",

I wanted to make sure because this location opened after the books were published and as such was not listed on the coupon.  They informed me that they did accept the coupons and I had no issues.  Fast forward two months.  I call and placed an order intending to use the other coupon in the book (most businesses have two in there). I get there and they inform me that they don't accept the coupon.  After making a stink due to the inconsistency (I would have been fine had they told me the first time they don't take them), the manager accepted it.  It may have been because the additional pizza was already made, but he gave it to me and apologized.  I would have been on here writing a one star review if he had not, so he was smart in that regard.  Anyway, I have since returned and ordered the \"Siciilan\" deep dish pizza (fwiw, pizza in Sicily is not this style; I have a good friend who was born and spent most of here life there) and it was very good.",

    "text": "so I am a big pizza fan.  Usually Marcos is my go to for their NY style but wanted to try something different.  Saw Empire had a Sicilian pizza and I thought that just sounded amazing!  I was excited to try it.  Called in my order for pickup,  everything went smoothly.  Got home and opened everything up,  at first glance I was amazed how big the slices were (again,  super excited) so I cut them in half.  Then I noticed the edges were completely burnt,  like chard burnt.  A little mad but I was still excited for this \"Sicilian\" style pizza.  Sat down and looked it over,  cheese wasn't even melted. It was more like an old,  dried cheese look.  Took a bite and the cheese didn't even stretch (you know when part of the cheese is still on the pizza but is stretched out on the bite you just took?  Ya,  that didn't happen)  pretty sure it was sitting for a while but they said 30 min,  I got there in 20. I usually can eat 6-8 slices from Marcos (don't judge me,  you don't know),  I was only able to stomach 2.5 (sad face). I wouldn't recommend for future and won't be ordering from there again.",

I had a side house salad with grilled chicken and the bf ordered the two slice special, SO WORTH IT. The salad was delicious and huge, the grilled chicken was perfectly seasoned! It didn't feel like a chore eating the salad. The bf also enjoyed the pizza, the slices were really big. Our total came to around $12, score! Drink specials only included drafts and some wine, no hard liquor.   We will be back for sure! Cheers! Someone was eating a calzone next to me, calzone, you are my next victim.",

Not to greasy, abundance on the sausage and LARGE not what the franchised very state pizza size, super small, this is my MOM'S pizza size.  Oh and really, REALLY right up there with NYC pizza if not better! Oh did I really say that   The wings which I was going to hold of til later to try, but they kept calling me from afar saying please come try use you'll love  is for sure. They were absolutely amazing, a little dry for me as I like moist and juicy, but they are  wings and the were like nothing I've tasted in NY!  The garlic parm were to die for, but then the Carolina Gold just roped it! The desserts will have to wait for later but I have to admit if they are anything like the food or the zeppoli I tasted so far, they I'm sure will meet up to my expectation.  So this ITALIAN NEW YORKER who's mom made Home made pastas, pizza, calzones, and the holiday Home everyone wanted to go to for family meals, I give this place  Need I say more",

No one offered to help me out to my car when clearly I was having trouble and when I asked, they told me to come back and get the rest. Every time I call to place an order, I always get put on hold for a while and have to sometimes call back again. Today when I tried to place an order for delivery, the lady was being extremely rude with me to the point where I had to end the call. I never complain about customer service but felt like I had to after this happened. Will not be back.",

I called after the stated delivery time to ask where my pizza was and they didn't know.  Said since they can't see it on counter must be out for delivery.  They started the call by saying it will be 3 hours if you are ordering now for delivery and 2 if you are picking it up. How do you run a restaurant this way?

Glad I did.  They make a really good NY-style pie.  Got a pepperoni and a sausage, and both were good.  Compared to what I usually find in the south, this was OUTSTANDING.  The restaurant itself seemed nice as well, with what looked like a friendly local crowd at the bar.  As I am in this area every couple of months, I will be back.  If you live in Fort Mill, I definatley recommend making this place a regular go-to pie shop.  I look forward to trying their Sicilian pie next time!",

    "text": "To me, Empire is just okay. We've been a couple of times since my hubby could live off of pizza.    When you walk in, the dining area is really dark, even if there's light outside. One half of the area has a bar. The other half is regular seating with booths and tables. It always seems noisy when we go so It's not my favorite environment.    The menu has your typical pizzeria options: pizza,  calzones, pasta, sandwiches and wings. We ordered garlic knots to start and those came out before our drinks did so that was fast, but we still had to wait until our drinks came. The knots were just okay. I couldn't taste the garlic at all, but the dipping sauce was good. For the main course, we ordered a pizza. We wanted to do a specialty pizza, but we weren't allowed to substitute toppings, but they could remove a topping. In the end, it was easier for us to create pur own and that was cheaper as well. We ordered a sausage, mushroom and peppers pizza. Honestly, it wasn't great. It seemed a little undercooked. There wasn't enough sauce and after taking one bite, all the cheese just slid off the slice.   Customer service was okay. We had to wait for refills a couple of times.   Maybe we caught them on an off night? But I don't care for the environment and the food was just okay.",

Well topped and cut into six pieces, the pizza was cooked just right for a crunchy bottom and nice melted cheese. Plenty of pineapple bits and ham and bacon. Yum!  Service was great. Who doesn't like being called \"Hun\"?",

Heck, I dont even have to ask, she will remember what people want if they have been in once. Lindsay is amazing behind the bar, I have never waited for a drink and my beer is refilled before my last sip is gone. I have seen her with 50 people waiting at the bar n she never misses a beat, professional, fast and always smiling. When you see a group of 20 regulars at a bar week after week you know she is doing something right.

The place was crowded and the waitresses could clearly not handle it. I saw my waitress twice the whole time, and had to track her down each time. My fiance and I ordered two small pizzas, one was fine and the other had terribly burnt crust. I didn't realize until we got home since we took it to go. The last time I went to Empire, I went at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday, and the place was dead (it was literally me and two other tables in the whole restaurant). When I sat down and told the waitress I was going to do a to go order, she interrupted me and told me to go to the to-go counter to order. I asked her nicely if it was alright if I could sit here and enjoy a beer while waiting for my food (you would think she would want a tip). She took my order without writing it down (big mistake!) Shame on me for not checking my order (it's never appealing when the bag is stapled and you just want to get out of there). She, or the cook, managed to screw up a two salad order. I ordered two garden salads and received one garden salad with no dressing (when I asked for dressing) and a Caesar salad (really?) General incompetence whether busy or slow.",

One of the times I was underserved, there were five parties who seated themselves before anyone came to a table.  We were the second to arrive, but the last to get service.

My born-in-NYC husband has been dying for good pizza in the Fort Mill area for the past seven years, and when we finally discovered the new Empire Pizza in Fort Mill, he declared it good!  When the kids want pizza, this is what they ask for.  We've been several times over the past few months and each time we order a different kind of pizza - we have yet to be disappointed.  They are all amazingly good.  The last time I went, with my son, I opted to get a sandwich instead, and it was just as good as the pizzas are.  We have tried most of the appetizers (the onion rings are awesome and their pita chips with dip are excellent).  The only thing that we felt was so-so was the zeppoli dessert.  I thought it was good, but my husband didn't think they were as good as \"real\" NYC zeppolis.  I think he's just a food snob. *lol*  We love playing the TV trivia whenever we go, and there are TVs aplenty to watch the games.  The atmosphere is great.  Service staff are diligent if not overly friendly (which we don't mind - when a place is that busy all the time, the staff doesn't have time for chit-chat).  All in all, the best pizza joint in Fort Mill!",

    "text": "I tried Empire for the first time on 4-17-15. I expected it to be a lot like Fuel Pizza...customers walking to a counter, ordering a slice of pre-baked pizza, etc., but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's an actual, normal restaurant.  I ordered two slices of pizza and added two toppings, which ended up being about $3.33 a slice. Normally, I'd say that's a lot, but the slices are so big that it makes up for it. One slice filled me up, and I usually have a voracious appetite. My boyfriend and I got garlic knots as an appetizer and, I must admit... I was a little disappointed. They reminded me of store-bought, bagged rolls with a little garlic slapped on them. Not bad, but not impressive either. Both the pizza and garlic knots were incredibly greasy, so I blotted them with a paper towel. Taste was great, though, and whatever cheese they use on the pizza is fantastic.  Our server was ok, she did her job, but she wasn't very enthusiastic or friendly. Who knows? Maybe it was a rough night.  Would I go back? Definitely. Is it awesome? No, but it tastes good and gets the job done.  EDIT: Went back last night (4-22-15) and ordered a side garden salad and a slice of pizza. The waitress got my salad dressing wrong, the salad was mostly big chunks of iceberg lettuce, and had hardly any toppings in it. My slice of pizza and my boyfriend's slices were cold. Seriously...it was like it had been sitting out for awhile. Our waitress had no personality...Not sure we will be back again.",

    "text": "If I had written this review a couple years ago, it would be raving 5 stars. Not anymore. Empire has dwindled down their quality so much to the point that I won't eat there anymore after my latest experience. I've eaten something (not always pizza) from here at least once a month since this location opened and at first I absolutely loved it. But, recently we ordered a 10in pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms and it just wasn't as good as it used to be, not to mention, they have decreased their topping quantity drastically over the years. We also had their \"new\" philly gyro, which is \"steak\", mushrooms, onions and peppers on a pita with 'cucumber sauce'. I wouldn't call this \"steak\". I'd call it \"steak-um\", because it's about as bad or maybe even less flavorful than the frozen steak-um you can buy at a grocery store. It's completely un-seasoned and flavorless. I also ordered their mozzarella sticks. I really don't know who thought it was a good idea to batter these rather than bread them, but they're horrible and again flavorless. I prefer my mozzarella sticks to be breaded with breadcrumbs. These are battered with some kind of thick batter that has no flavor whatsoever. It would be one thing if they used a beer batter or added some type of flavor, but these didn't even taste like salt was added. I opted for the marinara on the side instead of ranch. Their marinara tastes like its the cheapest canned stuff you can get. It's just not good. We also had a small greek salad. This was the best item of everything we ordered. A salad. Sorry Empire, but your quality had taken a nose dive. There's no coming back for me. You can't fix this, because I've given you the chance to improve over the last few months and you've just blown it in every way possible. I'd maybe come in for a beer, but that's about it.",
