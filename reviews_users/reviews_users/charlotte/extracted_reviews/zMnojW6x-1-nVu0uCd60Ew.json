    "text": "While visiting a friend last week in Charlotte we decided to get a drink and some food at Whiskey Warehouse!  I would call it a mid to high end sports bar/restaurant.  It has a really great rooftop bar that has heat lamps, umbrellas and a ton of huge screens for watching any popular sports game (some might like that more than me).    The bartenders were very nice and super efficient.  The food on the other hand took forever!  They did warn us that it would take 30 minutes for food but it took closer to an hour.  It was fine, just gave us more time to drink booze but I don't know if I would go back to eat, maybe just get a drink.  Great view of downtown too!",

    "text": "I came in this afternoon to watch the Panthers game with some friends. A lot of people have told me that Whiskey Warehouse has some of the best wings in the city so I thought I'd give them a try. I tried the hot wings, and I thought they were way too mild and lacking in flavor. Personally, I prefer the wings at Moosehead or Lebowskis, but whatever, they were OK i guess.  Aside from the food being pretty forgettable, though, the service that we received was very good. Our server's name was Megan, and she was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole experience. She checked in regularly to make sure we had all the food and drinks we needed throughout the game.  Overall, I thought Whiskey Warehouse had a nice atmosphere for watching football on Sundays, with plenty of TVs and a good selection of beers on tap, so I would gladly come back to drink and watch sports here. That being said, with all the other excellent food options elsewhere in Plaza Midwood, I may get food somewhere else beforehand next time.",

The rooftop has a great environment and view, service isn't bad, and the drinks are abundant, especially those pitchers! Any of them with whiskey were my favorites, but I probably don't need to tell you that twice. Great to share with a few friends and really just enjoying a beautiful spring night in Charlotte.   As with most rooftop patios, it got packed really quickly here (and probably does on most nights) so be ready to wait for a table to open up.",

They do have some good food as well. My favorite was walking in there on a Sunday picking up to go food for a sick friend. Food was not ready and I had to wait. They had a lovely Bloody Mary bar set up to which I helped myself to while I waited. Pretty clever I will say. They also have music on the weekends and for a bar, they get a thumbs up from me.",

I wouldn't recommend sitting up here though if you are bothered by a light of people standing around drinking and smoking. If you are looking for more relaxed dinner vibes eat inside. Some weeknights I am sure wouldn't be bad but weekends especially it is mostly for the drinking crowd.  I had the spicy vegetable stir fry and it was good. I am a huge spice fan so I can handle a lot and I felt this was spicy in a way I enjoyed but something others would find overly spicy. Will def. have to come again.",

The service and food is par and the beer selection is sub par compared to other bars in the area.  The patio on the roof is the real benefit.  If the weather is right, there's not many better patios or rooftop locations in Charlotte to go to.  My suggestion is to try it for yourself.  The interior decor is actually pretty cozy with warm wood materials, etc.  Parking can be tough as it is with any business in Plaza Midwood so be ware.",

The salmon salad is DELICIOUS!  I would highly recommend it for a healthy option.  I also saw a few friends get it.  The only thing I will say is that the actual salmon portion has looked a little inconsistent.  I got the Buffalo Chicken wrap with grilled chicken instead of fried.  It was pretty good, nothing special.    My ehhhhhh dish was the Prime Rib sandwich.  I was really excited to try it, especially after my server spoke so highly of it, but I was disspointed.  I think the worst part was the bun it was served on.  It was what I'd consider a \"sandwich bun\" you would get at a cafeteria, with weird seed things on it.  Good drink specials....Bud Light for $2 and Bloody Mary bar with a million sauces and mixes for $3.  The upstairs patio is awesome!

Over 1/2 the chips had nothing on them. It was basically a a few pieces of chicken, tomatoes and some cheese. No salsa. No sour cream. No beans. And for $11!

The pitchers are relative cheap for the amount of alcohol content you get  This place is a great starter place to come to pregame and bar hop to the next place. The environment is real chill and they serve some pretty good food that compliments the drinks here  I recommend getting the Jack and Coke pitcher as that is their most popular one.  Also the lemon drop one is pretty tasty too.",

Nevertheless, it was a beautiful partly cloudy day with non wilting temperatures, so we headed for the rooftop.   To our delight, they were playing blues music.  But, soon after our arrival, it switched to the worst rock of the 90's/turn of the century, except for one song by Velvet Revolver. Our drink orders were promptly taken, and we settled in to enjoy the magnificent view.  Everyone in Charlotte needs to come to this rooftop at least once. My husband ordered the talapia sandwich, which he said was ok.  It was fried, and he would have preferred it baked.  But my meal?  Holy herbivore!  I got the fried green tomato sandwich (and yes, I welcomed fried with open arms.). The bun had a smear of pimento cheese on it, too.  Yum!  Our orders came with fries, which was fine by me. I have to say it was well worth listening to Hippie Mike's monologue  of righteous opinions to have this late lunch as my reward.",

Let me break down your average visit to Whiskey Warehouse. Step 1 - Walk in and wait 5-10 minutes for a server or host to greet you.   Step 2 - Wait at your table another 10-15 minutes for your server.  Step 3 - After your server is done updating their Instagram at the server station she will come up to you shocked and appalled that you're the type of horrible human being that would dare order food at a restaurant. How dare you. HOW DARE YOU! She can't even.  Step 4 - Your order is sent to the kitchen and I can only assume the ticket is printed in some type of  ancient language that the staff has to take several hours to break down and translate.  Step 5 - Explain to your friends and family why they haven't seen you in months. Why you've missed holidays, work, birthdays.  Spoiler: It's because you're STILL waiting on your food.  Step 6 - Get your really solid bar food. Mostly super basic fried food and burgers. It is good tho.  Step 7 - Hope to god you have cash to leave on the table because I can't imagine having to wait to get your check back.  Step 8 - Step outside and cherish the fact that you've seen daylight once more.  A couple of sides to this. Only order something from the bar if you're some kind of weird person that loves punishment. Like the only way you can enjoy that beer is by suffering impossibly for it first.  I once ordered a to go pretzel to go. The person that took my order said 10-15 minutes. I literally laughed after we hung up. I being the expert planner that I am showed up in 25 minutes, fully expecting to wait another 5-10 minutes. After 45 minutes ... I got my pretzel.  The management is super nice and very apologetic, but at some point sorry isn't good enough and you need to fix your mistakes.  If the place was one street over it would have closed down 1 week in. Their location and the fact that a place called \"Whiskey Warehouse\" will bring in every frat bro within 50 miles is the only reason they stay afloat.",

Parking is the one issue here, but that's everywhere in Plaza Midwood.   Back to the patio... It's no secret. Want to do happy hour? Get there early.

    "text": "Showed up at 1pm on a Sunday.  Was pretty crowded but the wife and I were the only ones in line so the wait was only ~10 minutes.  Good to go.  I ordered a lunch dish (salmon sandwich). Wife ordered an omelette (vegetarian).  Food took 50 minutes to arrive.  Mine was OK.  Wife's order was f'd up but we were starving after waiting so long, so we let it slide.  Both meals were OK at best.  Will give a second chance at some point, but with so many good choices in the area that can seat and serve in under an hour, I have a half a dozen other places to go that have better than \"OK\" food.  I need to be fair here.  The wait was not unusual as far as I could tell; all those around us that were seated in a similar timeframe took just as long to receive food.  So this place just runs slow.  This is most likely a function of how the kitchen is smaller than the galley in my apartment, despite probably serving ~150 guests at a time.  Best part is food is comparatively cheap vs most brunch spots.  Bottom line: Whiskey FailHouse",

There are also several televisions to catch whatever sport is on tv. In this case, it was March Madness. You WILL struggle to find a table and pretty much have to stalk one to wait for people to get up or just make friends while they're sitting there. I had the special of the day on my last trip, which were shrimp skewers over rice with spinach and tomatoes. It wasn't anything special, but filling and with enough lemon spice to forego salt and pepper. Whiskey punch is also pretty good. Come for the sun, new friends, and drinks. Parking is terrible in Plaza Midwood in general, so be prepared to deal with it.",

There are tons of tvs and the upper roof deck is awesome when the weather is right. They even will run heaters when it starts getting cooler. It has an awesome view of the skyline and another full bar up top too.   They also show ufc fights and not many places do that around town without charging. I would definitely recommend WW!

I agree that this place pretty much seems outta place with its location and some of the douche bags it appears to draw. Maybe they will draw a better customers in the future but as long as the crowd they have now is spending, then management is probably perfectly ok with them.   I had the salmon which was delicious and we all shared the nachos app which was pretty spicy but also delicious. I found the beer selection to be moderately priced, maybe leaning a little towards  expensive. I didn't bother with the whiskey menu as that stuff pretty much turns me into a raging asshole. The decor of the place was cozy and it seemed to be laid out fairly well. However, the parking there sucks and we were lucky to get a spot. I'd probably give this place 4 stars but for the time being the frat boy customers look like they've all just graduated from Buckhead Saloon downtown and brought their doucheness to a new venue for display. Go check it out if you've got a chance. I probably wouldn't recommend being a regular though.",

Downside-on weekends they have a DJ and the music volume is VERY VERY loud.  This is a bar/restaurant and in trying to make it into a dance club, the Warehouse loses the appeal of lounge for conversing and sipping a fine drink.  We have to yell so loudly that the person in the next seat can hear pieces of a conversation. As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I can state that the combination of alcohol, yelling over loud music, and trying to hear over loud music causes damage to the vocal cords and hearing abilities.",

Once there, we were instructed, completely unprofessionally, by the bartender that people were sitting there still. So we went and sat at a different table. Two minutes later, the hostess told us to leave because there was a short wait.  We were left with drinks in our hand, and no where to go after being grossed out by a big damn bug.

We arrived at 8:30 on a Friday night. The wait was OK considering we had 9 in our group. They do have a cozy waiting section in the corner, filled with plush couches and chairs, however it's not a very intimate spot. The music was so loud and the couches were so far apart everyone in the group ended up shouting across the space just to have a conversation.   The wait staff, hostesses and bartenders we all very friendly and quick to offer up something to drink. The food was ... OK. Not the worst I've had, but certainly not the best. I got the grilled cheese - it was as expected. The fries were very good. Two friends got burgers, who said they were decent, and another two friends got the steak kabobs, which received mediocre reviews.   The other patrons weren't quite as fratty as I was expecting from reading previous reviews on here, but I can see where they were going with it. No Affliction or Ed Hardy tees in sight ...",

There were 8 people at the bar, max. I sat for several minutes and the bartender never even acknowledged my existence. I really wanted a waffle and realized the patio was open so I went upstairs. Night and day. Ashley greeted me promptly and was attentive. I also notice that lunch service is pretty bad. Last week they had to comp my lunch because the waitress never put my order in. Why do I keep coming back?  Because I really like the food. I normally stick to a salad with salmon or the waffles for brunch plus they have $2 mimosas. Also half price apps from 4-6pm.",

    "text": "i first noticed this place existed yesterday when we were on our way to the Penguin and the stupid bus couldn't decide if it was stopping or not at the Thomas Street light so i had to roll up to the next street where Whiskey Warehouse awaited. We decided to come back and give it a try.    We really liked the feel of the place, exposed brick walls, whiskey bottle pub tables, plenty of whiskey decor going on. There were a number of tvs but the sound didn't seem to sync with the tvs i was watching. i'm assuming that is something that will be worked out.    Unfortunately, i have to work today so i couldn't really explore the whiskey or beer options. Waitress said $2 Bud Lights today and $4 Jack everyday i believe.   So we were there for the food. While not a huge menu, there was enough to choose from with most of the standard fare. Of course, i went with the buffalo chicken wrap ($8) minus tomato. It wasn't bad, the sauce didn't seem to be simply on the chicken pieces giving it some buffalo taste even if you were just chewing on the wrap and lettuce which i appreciate. The regular fries weren't bad but the sweet potato fries weren't much better and probably not worth the dollar upgrade. The sweet potato fries don't compare to the ones from the Penguin.   The warehouse chicken received a thumbs up at our table and the Prime rib sandwich was given the \"it was ok\" rating.   Our server was on top of our drink refills.  i kind of like this place fitting in to the area, sure it isn't too 'eclectic and fun' but it gives a unique watering hole option.",

Yes, it is a bar with bar food, but it's the best bar and food off of Plaza. TV's float the room in the downstairs area with an old pub feel. Im not a whiskey drinking, but they are known for their whiskey liquor selection; Hence the name, \"Whiskey Warehouse.\" On nice days in Charlotte the patio upstairs is open with a full bar and TV's which over looks downtown Charlotte. Love the atmosphere and the food. I don't think I have ever eaten anything bad on their menu. My boyfriend and I always tend to go to Whiskey when we are in that undecided mood because we never know what we want to eat, like any relationship. On Sundays they have a Bloody Mary bar which is awesome! Grab a shot from the bar and mix your own drink! How cool is that? I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, cool spot!",

I would suggest it for a fall game day retreat. Bloody Mary bar is fully stocked on Sundays for brunch!",

Currently it is on the top of my list of favorite foods and my expanding waistline has to visit the gym more often to keep up.  All this rambling is to say GET THE SOUTHERN CHICKEN SANDWICH.  It is a dietary nightmare but oh so delicious.  It is a fried chicken breast with pimento cheese and bacon on a gloriously soft bun.  I've had other stuff here too and it's good, but this sandwich is by far my favorite.  Try it, you won't be sorry...unless you're on a diet.",

We knew we'd be here for a while so we decided to eat smething right away and then again later.  I had the wings in the barbalo sauce, combo of buffalo and bbq.  They were really good, had a bit of a kick but it evened out w/the sweetness of the bbq sauce.  My friends had fried green tomatoes, which I didn't try but have had them and I really like them, and spinach and atrichoke dip, that was really good too.  After a few hours we decided to eat again and we had grilled cheeses all around.  My nephews had them here once and we all kept stealing bites because it was so good!  I got mac and cheese as a side and the others got fries and sweet potato fries.  Grilled cheese was delish but the sides are not their strong point.  Fries are bit soggy and the mac and cheese was okay, but I didn't find myself digging in like I normally would.  I like it here, the beers are decently priced, its a nice bar, and the staff is pretty good.  I was here early so parking wasn't an issue, but I know it can be.  The clientele was very mixed, there were families, couples out for brunch, some elderly people, plenty of rowdy football fans, but nobody off putting.  All in all I like it here and tend to forget about it.  I will def be back!",

On the one hand, a place that purports to specialize in bourbons and whiskeys and conveniently has a vegetarian menu; on the other hand, reports of a sports bar vibe and a fratty clientele.  Hm.  Still, my brother is a big bourbon drinker and wanted to give it a try.  We rolled in around 8:30 on a Saturday night and were able to snatch a booth with a good view of the USC/Florida game.  Our server was perky and did her best to be helpful but admitted she wasn't much of a bourbon drinker.  She was, however, chatty and amply cleavaged, and given the crowd, the noise, and the TVs, seemed to be appropriate for the type of clientele WW apparently wants to service.  (And, yes, it's True - the clientele was decidedly frat-tastic.)  What I really wanted from WW was a dark, more intimate, saloony-style place, perhaps with servers who actually knew what they were serving and with management who cared more about the whiskey than about the game.  Unfortunately, Whiskey Warehouse is just another generic sports bar dressed up as a concept bar.  Meh.",

The drink specials are decent, $3 for OMB Copper on Saturday nights at a place that looks this new and nice?? That's a steal. Food isn't too shabby either. Good fried green tomatoes, decent wings, decent Mac n Cheese, and the barrel burger is pretty fulfilling and rad. What is the barrel burger you say? Well my friend, it's a tasty meat patty topped with chili and a fried egg of course!  The DJ still plays a lil' too much Kesha and crap though.",

Asian female bartender was great, and the beers were fresh and clean off the tap and some nights they've got great specials on domestic beers and Monday they've got a deal on ribs.  Anyway, we ordered the Protein Platter (new on the menu) and the Salmon sandwich. Protein Platter was EXCELLENT, and the salmon sandwich was cooked well but I felt like the spicy aoli lacked spice and taste.  Staff was attentive, cheerful and accurate. Food was great, but I felt the salmon was a little blah.

We arrived around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and, while it wasn't super crowded it was starting to fill up. The music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes, mostly rap & pop when I was there. I agree with Julia S. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college.   We were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient. Just as their namesake states, they have an extensive whiskey menu, and I would hope the servers are helpful in those selections, but none of us partook in those libations. They also had a decent wine selection, too. Inside, WW sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick/industrial feel inside.   I imagine if you can score a table, this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours. They also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their Sunday drink special - $2 mimosas and $3 Bloody Marys. Mmmmm hmmm...can't wait until noon on Sunday!",

They have a pretty cool vibe going on with a country-western/roadhouse type theme. Also they have three main sections in the building with the main dining room, the \"Single Barrel Room\", and the rooftop bar.  The main dining room is always packed and loud, and can be a good place to catch a sporting event. The Single Barrel Room is usually a little quieter and has a separate bar (although no drafts on tap). They have tables, but they also have couches and comfy chairs if you're just looking to lounge and have a few drinks, and TVs are still in abundance for sports viewing. Upstairs on the rooftop is where I frequent the most. They have a great view of uptown, a relatively good amount of seating, and also some TVs over the bar. Overall, a really cool place to go.  However... I have never had an amazing experience here. The service is always fairly slow and inattentive, and I feel like a lot of the menu items are over priced. They have a good selection of bar food and appetizers, but it's tough to find anything for less than $10. The most appalling thing to me is the price of beer. NoDa's \"Hop, Drop, 'n' Roll\" is one of my favorite beers, and a 16-oz can will run you $9. WHOA! It's tough for me to justify going to have a couple of drinks and an appetizer with friends and forking over close to $40 with tip.  Definitely a fun place to go, but make it a special occasion, and be sure to save up for it.",

Most places that have this type of bar setting and tv's for sports, tend to slack off on the food prep.  That is not the case here!  I've tried probably 15/20 menu items at this point, counting specials, lunch, brunch and dinner and i'm always pleased!  Some of my favorite items are: Buffalo Chicken Wrap, switching the Buffalo sauce for Honey BBQ. Warehouse Burger and fries Pimento Cheese App Fried Chicken tenders in Honey BBQ Prime Rib Sandwich.  Also, you can't beat $4 Jacks and their Bloody Mary bar on weekends!",

Tried asking  another bartender (the brunette with bird tattoos on her shoulders) for a straw and was guilt tripped for not trying to \"save the sea turtles\" when there are 500 unwrapped straws an arms length away from the bartender. Didn't receive the straw until the couple next to me asked for 2 straws and she finally caved and gave us straws and then proceeded to give me dirty looks for the entirety of the night. First time visit and never returning thanks to her. Disappointing when bartenders don't care to take of their guests, especially over something so trivial.",

They do not have a lot of parking (shared parking with common market), and I notice some people parking in the post office lot. We actually found a spot pretty quickly, I think it was like the fourth spot in. Anyways, we were greeted as soon as we walked in. She offered inside or outside (rooftop). It was a little brisk for me so we chose inside. We were sat at a booth and within a minute our waitress came over. She was nice, but low spoken so sometimes I didn't even hear what she was saying. The music was a bit loud too, I felt like I had to yell during my conversation. But they had a TON of televisions, which was good because we wanted to see the end of the 4 o'clock games. We both ordered a salad (mine was a house and he chose the ceasar). We both ordered the wings, last time we came was a whiiiillleee back and their menu changed just a little. The fries did not come with the wings but now they do!! The fries are good! Natural cut and not burnt or crispy. I loved them. And the wings were good, needed a little more sauce but you can always ask for more.   Overall, the food was good for \"bar food\". The server was a little shy - or soft spoken, or maybe both- but she was nice and checked on us several times.   I will most definitely be back!",

    "text": "Got asked for leave for no reason - this place sucks   way better places to eat and drink in plaza  After receiving a snarky message from management I have decided to expand on the above review which was written hastily.  On Saturday evening multiple parties of a conjoining friend group arrived at this establishment around 7:30pm. After ordering drinks and food, a member of one of the tables who suffers with a disability began playing with a container of ketchup she was given. She accidentally let it fall over the rail and some of it fell on the bouncer. Unaware of the situation, the 15+ member party was shocked to find their bouncer yelling and threateningly the young woman in the party. Shortly afterwards the poor waitress was told to throw everyone out (even members of the party at a different table completely unaware of what had happened). After a brazen attempt to box our food (and they made sure they got money out of us), they forced everyone to leave. Management never asked what had happened and the waitress looked incredibly uncomfortable.  After posting the review and receiving a self righteous message from management I will stand behind this review in its entirety because the situation, while understandable from the other side, was handled without much tact. I am sure that many members of the party after feeling disrespected will not be returning.  As for food and drink, average at best. There are excellent restaurants and fun bars in the area, I would steer clear of this establishment as they blindly listen to aggressive bouncers instead of patrons.",

Upon entering, we were impressed by the look, atmosphere, and wide-open space of the restaurant.  It was very inviting, fun, and alive with energy.  Our server was great, too, and she reminded me a bit of Rachael Ray -- both in her smile and her voice.    We got a great booth on the side of the restaurant (although I would have also have been happy at one of their several high-tops.)  I ordered a Bratwurst Sandwich from the \"Local Food Section\" of the menu.  For $1 extra, I substituted sweet potato fries for regular.  The bratwurst was delicious, topped with grilled onions and peppers, and so full of flavor.  It was just the right size, too, so I didn't feel overstuffed.  My partner on the other hand ordered the Southern Chicken sandwich -- a fried chicken breast with pimento cheese and bacon.  It was freakin' HUGE and a damn good value.  He couldn't even finish it all.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, too!  I also enjoyed watching the drunk sports fanatic at the table next to us who moved in very slow motion and tried to hold his head up the whole time we were there.  He was quite entertaining.   Lastly, if you're into whiskey (unfortunately, I'm not), they have a fantastic selection of brands for you to try.     We'll definitely return for a fun, casual night out.  I'd love to try their upstairs, outdoor seating/bar when it warms up again.",

Went up to the patio to eat and drink , halfway through our meal we saw another giant cockroach ON OUR FOOD. Then we saw two more under our chairs. We first spoke to the waitress and she told us that it's normal because we are outside. We then asked for the manager and he also told us it was normal and there's nothing they can do about it because we were outside. They only discounted $5 off of our $60 dollar tab that we didn't finish because we were disgusted. After we paid our waitress simply told us to \"have a good one\" and walked away. We are still disgusted since we saw a total of 6 cockroaches one of them being literally in our boneless wing. DONT EAT HERE.",

The giant soft pretzel is great but the cheese it comes with isn't so great. The Whiskey poppers are awesome.  They have an OK selection of local beers. Wish they had more. The upstairs outside patio is really great in the summer time. Good size bar with tvs and areas around the bar to hang out.  One thing I hate about this place is their policy for taking reservations on football Sunday. It's pretty ridiculous. They won't take a reservation for noon or later. So if I want to reserve a table for 6 I have to have everyone there at like 11:45 to get a reservation. That really makes zero sense. Why can't I reserve the table at 1:00? Or even 12:30. I don't get it.",

And we were one of the few people eating here. Super empty. We had ordered other things & literally asked for boxes bc we were just over it by the time it arrived. Oh & btw, one of those items was a cold salad requiring no cooking. We were also disappointed that their rooftop was closed until 4. I will say the long awaited wings tasted pretty good, but even that is not enough to bring me back here. Do not recommend!",

    "text": "My New Favorite Bar in Charlotte....  What's not to like about this spot? Whiskey Warehouse is the rare bar that perfectly mixes the concoction of bar, food, screens, service, patio-area/view and overall ambiance that make any bar worth going to.  Bar: Every time I've been here they have had some sort of beer special; from $2 bud lites, to $3 micro brews, to $4 Jack Daniels you-call-its.  R.B.V.s are also reasonably priced around $18 for two, which is more than straight.  Food:  I can honestly say this place has some of the best bar food anywhere in Charlotte - for real.  I have eaten here multiple times and everything I have had has been awesome.  I recently had the Monterrey Chicken Sandwich, which I can say was hands-down one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever had - every sandwich should have pepper-jack cheese and guacamole!  I have also had the wings here on multiple occasions.  The wings always come well sauced, meaty, well cooked, and with a cold, thick ranch.  If you've read my other reviews, then you know how important it is to me that they char their wings.  That's right folks, the wings are thrown on a grill for a min before they bring them out to you.  I had the chance to eat brunch here last Sunday, and I have to stay I was thoroughly impressed.  The toast was a little undercooked, but otherwise the scrambled eggs and bacon were up to par.    Screens: I love the fact that they have plenty of television screens littered and hanging from every corner of this bar.  Even when you go upstairs to the gorgeous rooftop patio, they have plenty of television screens embedded within the bar area.     Patio/View: Speaking of the rooftop patio - @ WW you will find nothing short of the most SPECTACULAR and BREATHTAKING VIEW OF THE CHARLOTTE SKYLINE anywhere!  There is plenty of seating and they have full waitress and bar service.  I also appreciate the H20 mist they have cooling down the patrons at the bar.  Though BEWARE fellas, many ladies are leery of the mist interacting with their hair!  Service:  Great service.  My order has always been correct each time I've ordered food or drinks.   I am preferential to the bar staff simply because of easier access to drinks, and closer views of the television screens.    I've tried to come up with something not to like about this place and I can't.  Prices are reasonable.  Though tight, they do indeed have a parking lot.  I meant what I said to start this review, I love Whiskey Warehouse, its my new favorite bar in Charlotte and I will def be back - hope to see you there!  PS: FYI: Monday WW has 1/2 price wings.  They serve brunch on Sunday's starting at 11am!  $3 bloody Mary's on SUNDAYS!!!",

We were in the area on Saturday and finally took the opportunity to check this one off our list. We started our order with a Jefferson flight that included Jefferson Small Batch, Jefferson Reserve, and Jefferson Ocean.  It was $17.  I've been curious about Jefferson Ocean, but never wanted to fork over $100 for a whole bottle without tasting it first.  IMHO, bourbon doesn't have to cost a small fortune to be great.  I'm glad I waited because I preferred the taste of the Small Batch best. We also ordered a Jack & Coke, which were on special for $4.  It was a perfectly balanced cocktail.  The coke was sweet, and the Jack wasn't watered down or too strong.  (You would think it would be simple enough to never get wrong, but many bars do.). In case you aren't a whiskey fan, they also had double Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on special for $5.   I ordered the BBQ pork plate. The meat was moist and seasoned well. It does have some heat to it, but not so much that it overpowered the taste of the pork.  I didn't try the slaw, but it was well presented and looked good. I substituted Mac-n-cheese for fries, and they came out hot and crispy.  My hubby ordered the fish and chips, and he was also very happy with his food.  He said the fish was moist and well seasoned.   What really impressed us about this place was the exception customer service we received. Our server patiently answered our questions and checked back frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a very pleasant experience and we will definitely go back for the Saturday specials!",

So large chunks of well done meat.  UGH!  The potatoes were the deep fried chunks (clearly a theme here) of potatoes like the airports serve.  It was not worth the price!  The drinks were the only good thing here!  Will not return just based on the service and the poor attention to details.  Don't use \"we're busy and have a small kitchen\" as an excuse.

    "text": "First let me say, I have never eaten here. I have visited multiple times for drinks and views in the evening and have been there once during the day for cocktails. The environment fits in with plaza with a typically prep pier leaning crowd for the area. I love the rooftop and the views it has. Limited parking is available on a pull through drive next to it. But is very very rare. Most visits I did not notice the staff or service meaning it was totally fine and not noteworthy. Sadly, this last visit, the staff was extremely disappointing. I went last Friday around 4pm. I sat on the roof with a dozen coworkers. Although there were 3-5 staff/bartenders at the bar the entire 2 hours we were there and around 4 other patrons, it's took 5-15 minutes to get any of their attention. They were standing within 6 feet of us and when we would come up to the bar, none of them would male eye contact. Eventually a blonde server would usually help us, reluctantly. She seemed very annoyed by all requests.   I will continue to patron here for late nights but do not plan to hang out here when I'm looking to be treated nicely and timely.",

    "text": "You ever want to not review a place because you fear that other's will find out it's awesome? ... Yeah, I guess that's why I've been holding off on reviewing Whiskey Warehouse. Either that or I'm a procrastinator. Here's the top three reason why Whiskey Warehouse is favored so dearly by me:  1. Wings The wings are some of the best \"traditional\" wings I've had in Charlotte and I've committed to finding good wings where ever I live. Wings over Everything! Wings (and ball) is Life! ... Anyway, there's a ton of good options in terms of sauce or dry rub. My top three choices are: Lemon Pepper, Parmesan Garlic and BBQ (tangy deliciousness). The wings are meaty and crispy and never disappoint. I usually go for all drums because all wing connoisseurs know the drums are the best.  2. Value / Happy Hour Love wings but balling on a budget? ... 1/2 price apps Monday through Friday. All the wing goodness, half the price! I guess there's other apps to try but I would stress focusing on the wings. .. Love whiskey! Of course you do! What else would you down your wings with? ... Well my friend / stranger reading this review there's $4 Jack Daniels drinks just for you (or anybody else with $4). Can't go wrong there. There's tons of other great whiskey to pick from at a very reasonable price.    3. Brunch on the Patio Sunday brunch ... you, your friends, a couple of flights of Mimosas for $12 or $2 glasses, a good selection of yummy eats ranging from pancakes to burgers and wings of course. what more could you ask for? ... You: What about a nice view of the Uptown skyline? ... Whiskey Warehouse: I got you fam. ... The patio give you all of that. If it's nice out, it might take you a little bit to grab a really good spot.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times now and it has not let me down! Whiskey warehouse has one of the next rooftop bars/seating areas in the Charlotte area. It's very spacious and of course, has a great view of the city!   The food has never disappointed. Some of my favorites are the buffalo chicken wrap, pimento cheese dip, and chicken Caesar salad. If you're in a pickle with making a decision, these three are always my go to and delicious! The menu is pretty big so I find myself being so indecisive more often than not, so it's always good to have your go tos. I always look forward to trying something different though if I am in the mood to expand my horizons :)   Drink specials are good for what I have seen. 2$ mimosas on Sunday's, 4$ for a double....can't go wrong with that! Overall drink prices aren't too bad, pretty normal for Charlotte. Service is always super friendly, dependent upon the day and how busy it is, it can be a little slow which is expected on busy weekend nights. But overall, I always look forward to coming back and trying new things and enjoying the rooftop!",

I came with a small group for dinner tonight-we were able to get a table on the roof right away. It was a nice view of the sunset over the Uptown. Was not thrilled with much of anything else the rest of the night.  There is a great selection of bourbon/scotch at the bar downstairs/inside; but you cannot order any of them upstairs on the rooftop. That was disappointing.   We also had poor service (wouldn't see the waitress for 20 minutes at a time), drinks (both liquor and simply water) and food came out SUPER slow.  Last thing, one friend at the table ordered salmon-which came out completely raw. Besides the fact that neither waitress or manager offered up an apology, the manager actually took the salmon back to the kitchen to cook it longer, asking \"if that was ok, rather than bringing out a fresh piece of fish\". Will not be back.",

I'm in a bar called Whiskey Warehouse, and you don't have bitters. She attempted to make two drinks for us anyway, one was all water and a cherry thrown in, not drinkable. The other was a half pour of a whiskey that was not what I requested or paid for. It's no wonder everyone around us was drinking wine or beer. Never going back.",

The drink specials are cheap and plentiful ($4 jack all most all the time) and they usually are well staffed with well trained, well mannered servers. It's in a part of Charlotte that is growing with new housing and cool bars/dives every week. The ambience is the regular sports bar with a bit more room for larger parties and sit down eating on the main level. On the second level -my personal favorite- is the patio! Equipped with plenty of tv's, lots of table top seating, bar stool options, a nice view of downtown and an added bonus is that they have bathrooms upstairs so you don't have to go up and down while having drinks. Also the bathrooms are not a run down toilet shack but really well put together. They have great food options and the wings are amazing !",

It was admittedly a great choice to watch UNC barely beat the Razorbacks. They have a relatively standard selection of beer, and unfortunately their menu wasn't updated at all when we went there and several taps were completely empty.Service was great the whole night though!  I ordered the spicy teryaki wings, and I think that I have several personal preferences that were not met: I do like a thicker sauce (this one was watery), I get a bit upset when I see entire halves of wings not covered in sauce (this means they weren't tossed and the sauce was just drizzled on), and I also like crispy skin (this was definitely soggy). But the meat was hot and there was a fair amount of it!  I also ordered a side of fries and holy cow those were DRENCHED in grease and totally soggy. Every single one of them. And there wasn't any salt either...  So although the food was on the lower side of OK, I did enjoy the atmosphere, and I'll continue to come here... I may have just come on an off day. I'll come back and try more things, and hopefully be able to bump up my experience.",

Nachos was HORRIBLE.  For $8, it definitely did not worth the price.  Can't believe I'm going to say this, but I would rather go to Taco Hell (I mean Bell) and get nacho there.  The pimento cheese spread was ok, look a little odd since it was mostly shredded cheese.  It had a little kick to it.  Not sure tortilla chips is the best companion for it... The best was the fried cheese balls.    We ordered wine that night, it was half-price bottle night.  Same as my original review, nothing to complain about the drinks.    Now on to service.  It was fine for the most part.  And just when you think something improved, one of the 3 waitresses that served our table (and she acted like she's the more \"senior\" of the 3) came over at 11ish, stopped us in the middle of our conversation and asked if we could tap out because she would much rather go home.  REALLY?!  Here's a news flash: how about get your rude & lazy butt home and let someone else finish out our table and get the tips that you obviously didn't deserve.  I worked in restaurants before, I waited tables, so I'm not just talking out of a pie hole with no merit.  That just totally rubbed me the wrong way.    All these months later, food was still so-so (super sub-par for nacho... a bar food staple that's really not hard to master) and the service still needed improvement.",

We went downstairs (after about a 10 minute wait) to get a table for 6. 15 minutes later no one even greeted us - I asked a nearby server if she was ours and she replied no, I then asked if she would get the server who was ours. 10 minutes later still nothing so I went back to the hostess who about 10 minutes later sent over that original server who claimed we weren't hers. If they were really busy I might have understood but we watched our \"server\" flirt with several guys at the bar and then stand around and chit-chat at the hostess station. After I explained to her that we would be leaving she just lamely said \"oh sorry\" . We went over to Jacks where the service was fantastic. I think management really needs to work on giving great service because they missed out on 6 dinners and several drinks...not to mention I may think twice about going there on game-day due to poor service.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this off by saying - to be fair, I came here after an event that was partially sponsored by this place, therefore it was SUPER busy. And from what I experienced, there wasn't a ton of parking, which is always annoying.  Because it was super busy - our service was pretty terrible & I feel like they could have prepared better, knowing there would be a rush of people coming in. I think on a more \"regular\" night, the service might be better & I'll for sure give them a second chance.  After waiting over an hour for my food (a salad), the order was wrong (I asked for two things to be removed & they were not) and the food was just sub-par.  One really GREAT thing about Whiskey Warehouse is their roofdeck...amazing view of the Charlotte Skyline! I plan to go back some night this summer & give them a second chance & enjoy the rooftop scenery!",

Had the teriyaki chicken, husband had the burger with fries. Teriyaki chicken was so delicious, may have been better than any hibachi restaurant version I've had. Husband said the fries were some of the best he's had... ever. Quality, local beer and great service. Will definitely be back!",

While I do come here mostly to grab a drink and walk around Plaza Midwood, I have grabbed a bite or two before. The big fish sandwich is delicious (even though I got it bun-less) It was large, crispy, and definitely hit the spot. The wings are good as well, though once my lemon pepper ones, were a little too lemony for my taste, but good overall. In short we keep coming back for the atmosphere and drinks.",

    "text": "Good enough pub food with a kind of annoying attitude.  I was happy to see something go in to the space left by Creation.    I've been several times for supper or lunch with groups ranging from two to eight.  They have a burger with bacon and egg that is delicious, if freakishly messy, and what I usually get.  Their sweet potato fries are crispy and garlicky like I like them.  They have at least a couple of vegetarian options, although the one my partner gets usually would better be described as cheese sauce with a few vegetables over white rice (not unappealing, but not light or healthy in any way).    There are LOTS of TVs throughout the bar and next to each booth, although they are easy enough to ignore if you want to have a conversation.  There seems to be an extensive bar, although I've never tried it.  As for the attitude, this is a restaurant with roughly eight parking spaces during the day when other businesses in the area are open.  The restaurant has decided that a good use of one of those spaces, and the one closest to the door mind you, is as permanent parking of a testosterone surrogate muscle car.  God knows I'm all for attitude and funky, but not when it interferes with function.    The staff routinely park in the post office parking lot next door during business hours, which then leaves the post office without adequate parking.  WW's owners are adding a rooftop bar this winter, requiring even more parking.  There is a sense of entitlement and disdain for their neighbors that doesn't sit well with me.  If you are looking for a place to watch a game or for a bar at which to stop on the way home, you could do worse.  If you are looking for a good neighbor, you'll probably want to move on.",

I thought the redneck mimosa's were especially good; they are a mixture of lions head beer, orange juice, and a splash of ginger ale.    I'm not a huge salmon fan but the the salmon salad looked especially good for $9 and the chicken tenders were nicely breaded and very fresh.

Anyway, I finally found a Saturday to grab lunch there with a friend, and in short, I look forward to my next visit. I ate in this building about 7-8 years ago when it was another restaurant (can't remember the name). The renovation changeover blew me away. I love what they did!! Very rustic and well done with plenty of seating options. It was a tad too cool to eat on the rooftop this day so that will be my next visit. Ok, onto the service and food. The place wasn't that packed so we got a table immediately. The waitress was very nice and we didn't wait long at all to have our orders taken. We each ordered cheeseburgers with fries. Fresh cut fries that is. Anyone that knows me will know hands down that good french fries will get me back for a second visit. WW has those fries. Seasoned just right and fresh tasting. The burgers were very good also even though the meat was a tad dry on mine. The only minor complaint I have was that it took almost a half hour to get our food after we ordered. The waitress kept telling us it would be soon. I definitely won't hold this against them. Even a well run restaurant has a difficult day now and then. Even then, I am usually not in a great hurry on Saturdays so it was ok with me. I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

Parking is also an issue during busy times.  Park at Harris Teeter, the post office, or on the opposite corner if no spots are available.

The parking in this area has always been tight but its been taken to a whole other level of screwed since WW opened. Harris Teeter and CVS have put towing programs into effect because patrons of this joint (and hey, others too, but no one really complained until, coincidentally, right after WW opened) are too lazy to park in the municipal lots scattered around the 'hood.

I got the Warehouse Burger and wasn't crazy about the BBQ sauce which tasted more like wing sauce (tart 'n spicy instead of rich 'n smoky).

And most importantly, True to their name, they have an obvious, albeit expensive selection of bourbon, whiskey and whisky that covers all the bases.  I'd give them four stars if they got rid of all the flat screen TV's and were in a location more suitable to the clientele that enjoys eating and drinking what's on their menu.

I expected it to be a typical redneck sports bar kind of place full of obnoxious drunk people.  However, being that it's across the street from my office, it was so convenient that I really couldn't avoid checking it out. I ventured in a few times with friends for drinks and appetizers, and I never had a bad experience. (Well, okay, once the service wasn't fantastic in the upstairs \"Top Shelf\" roof bar.)  Last night, I was there for dinner with a companion for the first time. The service was very friendly, but they were out of the first bottle of wine we ordered, and then it took forever to get our meal. We weren't really in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal, and when dinner came (tender, juicy ribs, perfectly seasoned cole slow, and crisp, delicious sweet potato fries) it was quite wonderful.  Here's the stunner. Even though we hadn't complained about the wait at all, our server notified the manager, Johnnalyn, of the situation, and she came right over to our table to apologize (explaining about the small kitchen size) and offer us a gift card for our next meal. Then came the bigger stunner. When our tab arrived, we had not been charged for our meal.  So here's why five stars. This is a restaurant that could get away with mediocre food and service, but instead delivers on both ends...including local food offerings (which I always appreciate) and the most professional and courteous management I've seen in a long time.",

It's actually like a classy version of a sports bar. We came at six on Friday for dinner after work. It has a great \"chill out\" atmosphere with great music. Also, a ton of tvs, extensive whiskey selection, and good service. The buffalo chicken dip was awesome. The wings were fall off the bone juicy, but the brisket was flat, dry, and overcooked. It did have really good flavor though.",

Decided to meet up with an out of town visitor for the skyline views at Whiskey this week. Unfortunately the awesome view wasn't enough to make up for the overpriced mediocre beer and subpar food.   Ordered the nachos on special during half priced apps (4-6) and what we  received was stale chips with under seasoned queso and a few slices of jalapenos with diced tomatoes. Pretty uninspired to be honest and definitely not worth the regular price of $11.   I would like to say I wouldn't return, but for some reason others seem to enjoy the rooftop bar enough to ignore the subpar food/overpriced drinks and I'm sure it won't be long before I begrudgingly return.",

One star off because it was too loud to have a good conversation but the food was decent bar food and came out quickly. The pretzels were delicious. My friend had the pasta dish for a simple $12 and coming from the northeast, that is unheard of! I could certainly get used to these prices!  As for the atmosphere - very loud, lots of sports games on TV and it seemed like there was a dj playing. The upstairs has a rooftop deck that I'm excited to visit in warmer months!",

They serve the beer in plastic cups that look like water cups at a fast food restaurant. Beer in plastic cups reminds me of a house party and beer in glass keeps the beer colder longer. The bartenders were impersonal and were talking among themselves rather than interacting with customers. I didn't see one of them smile. I asked for another beer and I think she forgot because I had to tell her again. We had two beers and decided not to order food.",

For me, the clincher was the great service I received from my bartender.   It was Saturday afternoon, and I needed water and some food in my belly to help fight off a hangover. After sitting at the bar and feeling that I was ignored (may have just been a minute), I said to the person next to me that I needed water and some service. Then Rebecca the bartender popped up like a magical fairy. With a smile, that never stopped, she managed to calm me down from a code red and serve up some good brunch and brew. She really tried to make sure I was ok and professionally paid attention to the detail, like sprinkling salt on my napkin so it wouldn't stick to the bottom of my beer in a frosted glass. I left very happy.  Thanks Rebecca and WW!",

The flavoring for the brussel sprouts was delicious but the brussel sprouts were pretty hard still and could have been cooked longer. The boneless garlic parmesan wings were by far the best wings I have ever had. The chicken was tender and they melted Parmesan cheese on top of the wings. Usually when I order garlic Parmesan wings they come dripping in sauce and the breading is soggy. The breading was crispy and appeared to have very little sauce but they had a lot of flavor. I liked them so much I order them to go again the next day.",

This place rules supreme in the Spring/Summer time, as their rooftop bar is one of the best in Charlotte. I believe nearby Peculiar Rabbit also has a rooftop, but it's sans bar, so I still would give my vote to Whiskey in this particular neighborhood.   $4 Jack Daniels AllDayErrDay, which is always my go-to. Food has always been superb, and is definitely one notch above normal bar fare.   If the weather is nice, head upstairs---you won't be disappointed.",

Whiskey drinks are $4 during happy hour which is almost an unbeatable price. Additionally, their menu is full of pretty good bar eats that come out pretty quickly. I ordered buffalo shrimp and it was extremely delicious.  Iimane is the waitress you need. She was extremely friendly and helpful and made sure we were always taken care of.  Only thing I would be mindful of at Whiskey Warehouse is that we saw several roaches on the rooftop. I don't know if these roaches exist inside the restaurant or just on the rooftop but it made me extremely wary of my food. I had already eaten before I saw the first roach, but going forward I don't know if I'll order food, I will probably just stick to drinks if I go back. An establishment such as thing should have far better bug control.",

I love the bar, of course by name they have a plethora of whiskey to choose from. So you can switch up your favorite drink with a new type of whiskey and see how it works out for you.  We also ordered food along with our mimosas, but I wasn't able to get a picture. I will say the food came out slower than normal, even though the bar had a lower amount of people. I'm not sure what happened but I will keep in mind that if that is a normal occurrence to just give your waitress an ample amount of time.  I would come back, for the drinks. I feel like with the wide selection of whiskey they have you can have fun making and pairing different whiskeys with the food that they do offer. So I would recommend this to friends.",

Behold they were and they were served to me just like that the cauliflower was good and although whiskey Warehouse closes at 2 am we were closed out tab wise at 11 something. I didn't take my food to go because it was a big disappointment. The wings themselves tasted old I had only eaten one, that was the worst I've ever seen this business be.

They also have a great view of the uptown skyline on the rooftop (with bar) when it's nice outside. Also check out the new Single Barrel Room located in the back (hours I believe are Wednesday to Sunday opening at 5pm), has a speakeasy kinda feel!",

The wings were nicely sized and tasted amazing ya hear me. Teriyaki was sweet with a kick at the end, not to hot but enough to make my nose run a little bit but that didn't stop me from demolishing my food. Heard the drinks are amazing as well which means I will have to return to try them out. But overall a great trip and cheap my total ended up being under a dub now you can't beat that.

The service is always hit or miss. You can't guarantee good service. They have a rooftop patio, which is a nice option on a day with good weather. Just basic food and drinks, nothing overly exciting.   I have never been overly impressed with the service or atmosphere, but don't mind it with a group of people occasionally.",

My self and a colleague ordered the warehouse burger, good choice until they burnt them and told us they were the last ones they have. The whole place was smoked out we could hardly breathe from all the smoke. My other colleagues received ice cold fries. After a complaint new fries were made immediately. I reordered the chicken and waffles and that wasn't bad. Still like the place.",

The chicken tender basket is a good value, but the tenders are just ok. Their pimento cheese balls are great. Another good option is their Mac and cheese. What brought them down to a 3 was their service. Our friend's order was wrong, and then they gave him the wrong drink. They forgot to get me my wings at first, so I had to remind them. After admitting that they forgot and me having to wait and remind them, we got nothing but a sorry. This on top of the service overall just was not good.  I have been here before because it is a good value and a cool place however, I don't come often because the service and quality can be inconsistent. At their best, they are a good choice. At their worst, they can be a disappointment. Unfortunately, the only thing consistent about this place is the inconsistency.",

I honestly don't know a more reasonable spot in the Plaza Midwood area. 4 Jacks, a decent menu, good drinks and beer on draft, and TVs playing all the games. It's also a great group spot.   In the summer they typically hair their rooftop bar open, with amazing views of the city. Some of my favorite items on this menu is the Buffalo chicken salad, buffalo chicken wrap, their burgers are really good, (vegan and regular) chicken sandwiches are good too. Did I mention the brunch?! The brunch here is amazing, along with great mimosa deals on Saturday and Sunday too! You can also do 12 dollar bottles of champagne.",

Their pimento cheese appetizer is one of my favorite pimento cheeses in town. The chips it comes with are cheap though; but the cheese is so good it basically doesn't matter. They also have a chicken sandwich with the pimento cheese on it and that also rules.   Their wings are some of the best in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Specifically their dry rub recipe. They don't always have them though. Once they're out sometimes it's a couple of days before they have another batch.   The upstairs patio has a great view of the city and on a nice day the bar area up there is spectacular. They've started food service up there now which is great. The wait staff is typically hit or miss. I've had good and terrible. Kind of depends. At peek hours they're always on. I've tried a few times to watch a game or two there but it just gets SO loud. Not my favorite place if it's prime time and you're trying to have a nice quiet meal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here the other week and sat at the bar downstairs. Usually we sit at the bar upstairs on the roof because it has such a great view, but it was a little too warm for that so we figured we would give the inside bar a try. It was around 4 in the afternoon and it was just us and two other guys sitting at the bar.  The bartender quickly greeted us and took our drink order. My boyfriends drink took maybe a minute, and she dropped it off and walked away. My drink however, showed up almost fifteen minutes later, after she stood at the other end of the bar and had a conversation with a co worker. I let it go, because for all I knew it was an important drink related conversation.  A bit later when our drinks were looking pretty low she returned, but only long enough to ask my boyfriend if he would like another and then walk away while I was mid sentence trying to let her know that I'd like another drink as well.  She promptly brought his drink and walked away again, ignoring me as I again, tried to ask her for another drink for myself.  After ten more minutes of her ignoring me as she kept walking past, the gentleman at the bar beside me finally flagged her down and informed her that I'd been trying to get her attention for a while. With a look a look of total irritation, she turned to me and asked what I needed. Finally I was able to order my second drink...however it took over another ten minutes for her to bring it to me. If I had ordered something difficult then I could understand the delay, but it was just a vodka tonic. Normally this would be the  point where we would leave and just go somewhere where the bartenders weren't so horribly rude, but we were famished and decided to just go ahead and order our food, and hope for the best...wish we hadn't.  While we were ordering, we actually caught her rolling her eyes at us.  Then when the food came out, she threw the plates down in front of us so hard, that part of my food fell off and landed on the bar, and then she just walked away without a word. That was all we could take. So after another few minutes of trying to flag her down, she finally came back so we could ask her for boxes, our check, and a manager.  She returned a few minutes later with one box (instead of the two that we had asked for), our check, and to let us know that the manager was busy and couldn't talk at the moment...Seriously?!?! We paid and left, and will never be back.",

The food we ended up ordering was great, but the service was nothing special. $12 carafes of mimosas have a surprisingly good champagne-OJ ratio (despite taking 20 minutes to get one after sitting down at our table).

The addition of the rooftop bar is genius and a perfect vantage point to watch the city skyline. Had the portabella burger last time with sweet potato fries and it was all delicious. Of course, I'm a sucker for portabella burgers, those shrooms make everything delicious.   They have a wide selection of whiskey (of course) and other liquors. And a decent selection of beer. Bartender made me a gimlet one time and it was spot on. I love me my gimlets.   They have a great space for hanging out with a group of buddies, watching whatever sport is on, a fun night out, or even a date spot (mood lighting ftw).",

    "text": "Won't be going back to whiskey warehouse...  Where do I begin? This is the second negative experience I have had and what is worse than that is the managers response on both occasions.  The first experience was me asking for more butter with my meal. When I received my bill there was a charge for extra butter.  When asking the manager why I was charged he said he was new and it was \"company policy\". Really, to charge for butter?? Should I ask before asking for more ice, salt/pepper???  The second time I was there ordering dinner again and decided on an entree. When ordering I ask if I could do a different side (something other than what the entree came with) she said sure what would you like? So I sub'd the rice and kale seed mix for a house salad and Mac n cheese.  The salad arrived first and was not cold - more room temp which is not the way I prefer a salad but waited on the entree to arrive hoping it would be better.  The food was \"ok\" bar food and nothing to give a raving review on. Just \"ok\".  I get the bill and was shocked again to see (sub house salad $3 - sub Mac n cheese $2.  I ask the bar staff and was told \"yeah it's on the menu, do you want a manager?\" Yes that would be great!  He shows up with an attitude from the beginning saying \"it's company policy\" and \"it's on the menu\". I ask - Why wouldn't a server mention this? \"It's on the menu\".   I said this is the second bad experience have had here with feeling like 1) if there is an up charge please do me the courtesy of telling me AND most importantly I have NEVER been treated this way by two different restaurant managers from the same location in such a negative way.   No - \"I'm sorry. Let me take care of this for you this time but please be aware of the up-charges going forward.\" Nothing!!   I guess it's \"company policy\" to not be nice and courteous to the customer here. I will not be returning ever bc of the managers attitude and the \"company policies\" that Whiskey Warehouse has. Good luck!",

Not so sure how that will work out for us next time though!  The rooftop bar has a great atmosphere. I've been up here on a Saturday night as well when it was pretty crowded, and I still thought it was great. My group has never had a problem finding a table to sit at, and it's usually 6 of us or so. Then again, we arrive a little later, around 9:30ish. The bathrooms at the rooftop are also nice and clean, though they are just one stall only.  The drinks are good, but I usually get the same thing every time and I've discovered each bartender makes them different. Some are better than others. Also, depending on who's in the kitchen, the food will be better than other nights. I had the Whiskey Glazed Salmon salad and it was very good. I definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "So....checked out the place on Saturday night. I've only been here one other time and it was for lunch, so I don't remember too much about the place. From reading other reviews, i'm assuming the upstairs is a recent addition? I'm sure it will be a 100% return investment for WW. Parking was pretty difficult to find, but i'm sure it was probably even worse than normal this weekend b/c of the locals that were trying to flee to other places away from uptown, due to the CIAA tournament in town for the weekend. I'm a sucker for places with no cover, so that earned WW some points. We got there around 11pm and the downstairs area wasn't really that crowded. We walked upstairs and it was pretty packed....kinda hard to walk around, but hey, that's life, right? The ladies there were pretty good looking and appeared to be well put together. I'm a people watcher, so I look at everyone....as for the fellas, like others have touched on, there were your typical frats and older gentlemen that look like they just came out of retirement, but haven't been out in so long, they don't know how to fit into a social environment....Sperrys boat shoes, button down shirts tucked into jeans (oh my goodness, a fashion pet peeve for me....almost worse than flip flops with jeans and a hoodie), sportcoats that look like they came from the two piece suit that they probably wear during the week for work.....anyways, gotta stay on topic right?  Music was your typical 80s/90s hits that most bars play.....nothing special. Drinks were reasonably priced, spectacular views of the Uptown Charlotte skyline and that purrty Duke Energy Building. Would definitely check out the place again as I do like to switch up my spots....it has potential to be a good Spring/Summer joint",

Wish it were larger to accommodate all the adoring patrons, which by the way were fairly diverse in age which was nice.  (Although there were no children which I thought was appropriate considering it's mainly a bar.)   Although we only ordered basic bar food and a salad, all was good.  Drinks were not ridiculously overpriced which in Charlotte is a rarity.  The atmosphere is cool & cozy, the sunset view is beautiful, the service was good (bar service was stellar, table service less so but fine), and the strategically placed fans were much appreciated.  Oh, and the 80s music rocked.  Thoughtful owners.  I'll be back, again and again.  Hopefully it will remain a great experience.",

I wish I remembered her name because not only was she personable, she was funny too....major plus. We ordered an Asian Style Grilled Chicken and Rice appetizer (which must be new,because the waitress was not aware of it) and it was awesome. It definitely shouldn't be overlooked when ordering. I got the Veggie Burger and my friend got a Maple Pineapple Chicken Sandwich concoction which I advised her against because it seemed like an odd combination. Stupid me....it was awesome! Both were actually really good. Beer was really cold and they had $2 Domestics....another plus. Service was prompt, especially considering they had 3 HUGE parties in at the same time.

Or even if you could care less about an intriguing beer menu of both local an national brands. Maybe you don't even drink alcohol! You should still go to Whiskey Warehouse. The Plaza Midwood location is a neighborhood I love because of the community and the other restaurants and bars in the area, but Whiskey is a little different. Hardwood floors, walls, tables, everything gives it a bare stripped down feeling, but if the wood looks less than comfortable that pop a squat on one of the lush overstuffed leather couches in the corner. The food is fan-freaking-tastic! Wings, ribs, steak, and even great salads and sides for my vegetarian friends. It's never really that crowded, which is perfect because it isn't really that big but somehow gives off a spacious vibe. Maybe it's the high ceilings or giant plasma tv's over the bar. Whiskey is a great place to start or end your night. They have fun events and month long drink specials! \"Home of the $4 Jack Daniels,\" is a great slogan they proudly boast, but I just love it for ambiance, selection, and general merriment.",

We ordered an appetizer of wings with our drinks.  When the server came back with our drinks we ordered our meal.  A while later, we still don't have wings and I see out food just sitting in the window and other servers/the manager just looking at it waiting for our server to come over- ever heard of teamwork? Then our wings come out about 5 min later by the manager who asked if they were supposed to be an app.  When we said yes, he said \"oh\" with no apology or anything.  Also, most of the time we were here he was standing in the corner talking to the group of servers or texting.  Didn't really seem him working.  The food here is good, but don't expect good service.",

At least 12 people who came in after us (and two who even came in after we ordered) received their food before we did. Despite numerous inquiries, we didn't even get an apology out of the server or management. I'd eaten there once before and the shrimp kabob had been pretty decent, but the turkey burger several of us got was dry and tasteless, and they served me a side of chopped onions and peppers as the \"vegetable of the day\". Onions and peppers are what you cook vegetables in! Others in our party received their food cold, ironic after how long we waited. There are just too many good restaurants in the area for me to EVER go back there again. Sticking with Thomas St Tavern from now on!",

This rustic looking pub has an industrial feel built into a sports bar with many TV's and a large rooftop patio.   We started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer, cooked in a white wine, garlic and parmesan reduction topped with bacon jelly. We are really not sprouts fans, but we gave them a try and were not disappointed. They were roasted, smoky and the bacon jelly could easily get addictive. Dora here. Still not a sprouts fan, but this appetizer is a great way to entice kids, er...adults to eat their veggies. That bacon's like candy!  Since May was National Burger Month, we ordered burgers. I selected the Elvis Burger, topped with peanut butter, bacon and cheese. Now I am a peanut butter lover but have never thought about adding it to a burger but will in the future. This burger was large, juicy, and tasted great. You could taste the peanut butter, but it was not overwhelming and blended together perfectly.  Dora here. Based on our friendly server's recommendation, I ordered the Bistro Burger, topped with caramelized onions, Brie cheese, bacon and a horseradish dijon aioli. Oh my stars! This juicy burger wowed me with robust flavor, the sweetness from the Brie and onions calling out for more bites until all I had left was an empty plate. The hand-cut fries were a perfect accompaniment, and finally, a restaurant that passed my iced tea test with an A+! Adding Whiskey Warehouse to our \"must return\" list.  I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

I ordered the mimosa ($2 on Sunday or $4 for a doube.....of course you have to get the double) and my husband ordered an OMB beer. They didnt have a ton of draft selections up there, but I am assuming their selection downstairs was larger. Nice champagne to OJ (aka 2/3 champagne) pour! I also ordered the chorizo sandwich with sweet potato fries. It had a fried egg and jack cheese on top. Very good!  It was fairly busy but we were able to find two seats at the bar.

When we arrived, it was super loud. They had a DJ playing dance hits, with people getting out of their seats and getting rowdy with the music. The place had a definite fratty vibe.  The whiskey selection was decent. I've seen much better lists of bourbons, and it seemed like they were mainly just picking out as many whiskeys as they could. They were missing great bourbons, but I guess it's not a bourbon warehouse, huh?  They offer a variety of decent locally brewed beers, which was exciting. The beers were nearly all $5.  The service was pretty good, our drinks never went empty, and we were checked up on regularly.  The place is clean, and well kept. It has a classy interior, with an awesome rooftop patio!  My favorite thing about this place was the number of televisions that they had going. They're on every surface around, each tuned to a different sporting event.

The entrees were slow to arrive and all were cold. The drinks took literally years to come out. The cooks and bartenders are working hard but the food just sits there. The manager didn't even apologize for the slow service but did comp one drink and a burger after it wasn't delivered in the first place and everyone else in our party had eaten.   They were out of two appetizers to start. They did not help us out or offer towels or napkins to clean a spilled water glass. We had to get them and clean up ourselves. The waitresses disappeared and we had to search for them to get our checks after 45 minutes waiting.   The TVs are good but very loud if a game is on. We will not be back.",

I had been gone so long my friends had to come look for me because they thought I had left! I never complain about bad service to a manager but this woman had caught me on a bad day. I went and spoke to a bar tender in the back about the situation and she got the manager. I spoke to her about what had happened and she was extremely understanding and comped me a drink. Her and the bartenders at the other bar turned my negative experience to a very positive one and I greatly appreciated it!

I would've said something to the waitress but I really didn't want to wait another 40 minutes. I'll probably order again but next time I'll call ahead.

They've always been good to me and the fam. But I must update my original review. I've ordered takeout quite a few times. Mostly without and issue. But for the last three times there's been serious issues with my takeout order. And usually it's not until I get the food home in \"good light\" when I can tell somethings wrong. Tonight, after the 3rd time I have to change my review and rating. I ordered 10 wings and mac and cheese. 2 of the wings had bones showing and were overly dry (fried hard). And one wing was so dry, it was like dry cowhide. Needless to say I was disappointed. My hope is that they will get back to providing good food and good service on takeout just as they do when you're sitting in the establishment. I'll continue to visit WWH. But not sure how soon I'll be ordering takeout though.",

If I could give rankings on individual 'areas' of a restaurant and get a mediums number, I'm pretty sure this would fall in the middle.   The best thing about this place is the location/atmosphere. This is in a great place, just outside the uptown and super convenient to access. The vibe inside is relaxed, but fun. My favorite part is the rooftop deck complete with a large \"U\" shaped bar in the middle surrounded by various sized tables. There's roof access from inside and outside the building. There's a pretty sweet view and it's just a great spot to take advantage of lovely CLT weather   My visits were complete of four women on both occasions and service was mediocre. They weren't very busy, and we often found the servers standing around the register area...sometimes eating, sometimes touching their hair. Most seemed quite young.   The beer was priced accordingly as well as the meals. They're were everlasting different dishes ordered and none of them were raved over. The True highlight for me was their sweet potatoes fries - OMG!!! I'm not a huge junk food person, but when I have good food out in front of me...all bets are off. These things are magical. I would say they're in between a shoe string and regular sized straight cut fry, made of delicious sweet potatoes. They were perfectly cooked and I don't think even one of the big ones were soggy. I personally think soggy fries (sweet or regular potato) are THE WORST! These babies are on point.. I ate all of them, but left the chicken tenders as leftovers",

I spent 15 years in the industry so didn't want to assume that this would design the pace of the rest of our service, but it did. The food was meh, objectively meaning it was not prepared as requested and there was a hair in our food (which I am not sure the server even cared when told-- was more like \"oh\" and took the plates and walked away). Great for a late night roof top drink party, not so much for food....especially when we have so many other options in Plaza!",

If they are legitimately out of this many selections, then the manager should be fired.   Our waitress was nice and that poor management put her in a challenging situation.   Our food was ok and the atmosphere wasn't bad.   But this is NOT a Whiskey Warehouse.   Not even close.",

If they want to charge this much, they need to provide better quality food. They have 10 wings for $16. What? A SIDE salad is $6 and trust me it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's bar food... some things are better than others but either way it's bar food and it's way over priced. If you're going for a cool environment and a drink, this is the place but don't expect much out of the food.",

Unfortunately, it is the best rooftop in the city so get there at opening time or be prepared to sit inside/stand around waiting to steal a seat as it is first come first served.   I came here to eat last week for the first time. I usually only go here for the drinks. There was a wait but we eventually got sat. They informed us that they were giving us the new menu but they hadn't actually started serving the new menu so we should ask our server about something if we were interested. Thought that was weird... Why not just wait to put out the new menus?  They were out of a few of the beers we wanted. Ended up getting a pretty good one I had never had before. I got a steak wedge salad medium rare and it came out the steak was cold. Not just room temp but cold. Everyone else at the table had gotten something fried so my guess is that mine sat out for awhile. I hate complaining but couldn't eat it so let me server know. They must've microwaved it and brought it right back out and it was well done. I was pretty shocked they would do that. I asked for more steak and finally got it right. Chewy steak though not worth getting.   My server was great. The food wasn't so great.",

Coming in, first thought was that it was a bar...but not like every other bar where only sports ruled the televisions. It had a family feel as most bars didn't. On top of the family feeling, service was great. Our waiter was on top of everything and we even shared a nice conversation with her.  So lets get on to the food. I ordered the Charleston Shrimp Pasta which I thought was pretty good. It was a well portioned meal, with garlic bread, cheese, and of course shrimp on top of linguini pasta. I thought it was great. It had a nice blend of taste as well as a cheesy taste which I say is always good. It wasn't too overpowering to the point where you couldn't taste any of the other flavors of the dish.  Other dishes that were ordered were of course the Fried Green Tomatoes. It seems like it's a favorite around here so we decided to order it and it was good! There were no complaints about that dish.  Overall, I felt like this place was a great restaurant for families and drinkers alike. With a loft with a great view of the city (which I recommend to go during fall when it's cooler) and drinks and food, you won't go wrong!",

Four of us tried to share a pitcher but it would have been better for three people. That's about all you get from a pitcher, three drinks. The Lynchburg Lemonade was pretty good, had to get something with whiskey since we were there :)  Ordered the Monterey Chicken Sandwich and it was really good! Grilled chicken with salsa, guac, and cheese on a really good bun and the fries were the real kind with the little crispy skin pieces, so good. Everyone else got burgers and all finished so seemed to be good. Boyfriend got the Elvis burger that had bacon, cheese and pb on it! He liked it even tho sounds kinda strange to me. Said he'd have a burger with pb on it again :) Anywho, we'll definitely return sometime. Prices aren't too bad, great view of Uptown from the patio and heaters up there for the cooler weather. Plus its close to other bars if you'd like to hop around Plaza Midwood for the night.",

BUT if you are in need of a talented management and staff to be able to help you with a special event, I highly recommend hitting Al and the gang up for use of their back room. We took Beards BeCAUSE to Whiskey for our inaugural \"No Laughing Matter\" show.  It was a night of stand-up comedy to combat domestic violence.  Yes, I come up with some odd ideas. The crew at Whiskey were extremely accomodating.  They made it easy for the crowd and servers to communicate without disturbing the comics and offered their full menu.  (I housed the steak and asked for bacon added to my mac and cheese in between shows.) We comfortably sat about 55 for the first show and 65 for the second. When the first show ran a little long, the staff was totally on point with turning over the room for the second show.  And they were on the spot with more tables and chairs when the second crowd was larger than the first. They really helped fine tune my wacky idea and turned it into a fantastic fundraiser.  We look forward to going back every year for this unique fundraiser.",

The only goal of this establishment is to take your money and in return you receive bad service. They blatantly over serve alcohol to a lot of patrons. But it gets worse, when we were able to finally submit a food order it was taken in a very unprofessional manner. Then the entrees were brought out before our appetizer, I tried to speak to the waitress about it but her response was to roll her eyes and walk off. So I requested to speak to the manager. When the manager arrived he already was very defensive and was in a foul mood. I asked him why our food came out in the order it did and his response was \" be happy you got your food!!\" At that point I explained to him that is not how you treat customers and that we are leaving, his response was just walking off! So as you can see don't waste your valuable time and money.",

    "text": "I know, I know; \"Good menu selection\" or \"Holy cow, amazing\" may not necessarily be the first thoughts that pop into mind when you think of Whisky Warehouse. But to my wonderful surprise, there's far more stacking up in this kitchen window than just good 'ol Jim Beam.   I'm so pleased to say that its name actually doesn't do this joint a bit of justice; aside from an awesome bar scene, dining area and fabulous upstairs patio, the food is the real \"worker\" of this warehouse.  With everything on its expansive menu from traditional Carolina classics like pulled pork and chicken dishes smothered in sweet, honey-glazed BBQ sauce, to popular appetizers like the,Whiskey handmade Pimento cheese poppers, hand battered and fried to perfection, all the way to the Creme Brie Chicken, a unique sandwich topped with cinnamon-grilled pineapple, maple syrup, Brie and candied walnuts,(um, yum) Whisky Warehouse is a Plaza Midwood \"hit.\"  And as if that wasnt enough of a well-rounded selection to tempt even the pickiest of eaters, they take it even one step further by offering an assortment of awesome vegetarian dishes. Who wouldn't love the Commonwealth Pasta made of whole wheat noodles, veggies and Parmesan tossed in a light, creamy sauce? Literally, whatever you're hungry for, you can find.  However, the dish that takes this cake and gets all of my thanks and praises has to be the \"Elvis;\" a burger even the King himself would be proud of. Served with lettuce, tomato and home cut Whisky fries, this monster patty is stacked with American cheese, bacon and PEANUT BUTTER.  Yes, you read that right; the crazy combination of the juice from the burger, mixed with the creaminess of the melted cheese and saltiness from the bacon and PB, it's a combination that can only be deemed \"genius\". Well done, Chef Sam.   Be sure and check this spot out the next time Happy Hour rolls around, the family is in town visiting or for another perfect sunny Charlotte day on the patio. The bartenders, servers and managers have been nothing but as friendly and attentive as they could be. What more could you possibly want in a restaurant? They're the real deal, y'all.",

It took me a few minutes to get noticed but it wasn't really a big deal, being in the restaurant industry myself,I know bartenders get busy. My girlfriend and I ordered a wedge salad and wings to split. We were enjoying our food until I noticed something in my salad dressing. We thought at first that it was a ring but it actually turned out to be a metal nut that goes onto a screw. We called the bartender over and she took it and walked away.  When she came back she said \"Here is  another bleu cheese\"  and I told her that were that we were obviously done with our meal. She responded by saying \"I'm sorry, it's funny sometimes how things just get into things!\" Is it funny? Because I didn't think it was that funny that I almost ate steal. She then brought me my check. I paid for my bill in full and then asked to speak to a manager.  The bartender then said \"Yea, I tried to find him and tell him but I don't know where he is.  But I did tell the chef,\"  I told her that I would wait to speak to a manager when she eventually found him. After 20 minutes I left because the bartender and/or manager never came back over.  I am in the service industry and I live in Plaza Midwood. It's my neighborhood but the way that my situation was handled was ridiculous.  I absolutely will never return the Whisky Warehouse. It was disappointing.  That meal should have been comped. That manager should have been available and the bartender should clearly be retrained.",

I would hardly call myself a whiskey guru, hell to think of it the only thing I know about whiskey is jack daniels and jim beam, which I know beam is technically bourbon, but they have a lot more options then the average going bar will.  Anyways, back to the warehouse review.  The rooftop bar is a great hangout, the wife and I have spent a few weekend afternoons here on warm sunny days.  The crowd is typically a late 20's early 30's kinda crowd, usually good people just looking to have a good time.  This isn't exactly the kinda place that makes you dying to go back, however, it is a cool place to spend some time have some drinks and you typically won't regret the trip.

What was supposed to be (I am assuming) a chill atmosphere quickly turns into something you would find at Black Finn (without the dancing). If you're into that sort of stuff (which I am) then it's great, but if you're not, I think you'd be better off going to Thomas Street, which has a less crowded scene.",

    "text": "Well I don't honestly have much to say... I've been here before and their spinach dip is okay. As a vegetarian its wonderful to see a section of the menu devoted to things I can eat but I've just never ordered any of them. They have a pretty varied beer selection, which is nice, and I got an OMB Copper (or 2) for $3/pint last night. The ambiance is nice and I would probably go back. However, last night I was faced with one of those service no-nos.... actually there were two of those as well. I sat down at the bar with my friends and waited 5 minutes before either bartender realized that I was a new member of our group of 4 and that I was signaling them so that I could order. Got a beer, all was fine and then I realized I was hungry. It took another 10-15 minutes before I could get their attention for a food menu. And once I had decided it took another 5-10 minutes to get their attention that I was ready to order dinner. Let me say that the whole time I was trying to get their attention, I would raise my hand or say \"excuse me\" every time they passed in front of me to signal that I would like for them to come over. It was as if they were intentionally ignoring me. So I finally put my food order in (2 sides: mashed potatoes and mac and cheese) & I finished my beer. I wanted another one so I waited (again) and tried to grab their attention (again) as they were walking around right in front of me (again). I waited about 30 minutes for my 2 sides and at this point I hadn't eaten anything besides a handful of cheez-its all day so I'm getting antsy. 40 minutes pass and I still haven't received anything and I was frustrated and hungry so I cancelled my order. I didn't care to ask why or how long it'd be because they had been ignoring me all night and I didn't want to deal with that any more. Plus my friend was leaving and I didn't want to have to scarf my food down in 10 minutes. So after 40+ minutes of waiting, I asked the bartender to cancel my order & her reaction implied that she had never even put the order in. Its fine- I ended up having macaroni and cheese and chocolate cake from Harris Teeter last night in case anyone was worried about my not eating yesterday. But anyways, on the bright side, which is why this review wasn't lower, she took care of one of my beers for the inconvenience of not having any food. It was appreciated and it seems like its hard for people to take responsibility for stuff and make it right these days- especially in the service industries. I wish more businesses would do that and I'm willing to give them another chance just for that alone. Plus, as I said before, they have a whole section of the menu for vegetarian food. Can't pass that up.",

    "text": "the current reviews back up my review I did over a year ago....in a neighborhood w/as many great bars as P-Wood has, WHY would anyone bother coming here?...although as it IS a landing point for every poser-ey douchebag & pretty person in a 10 mile radius, maybe we SHOULD encourage its existence so they can all flock here and stay out of the good bars in the area...so if you're reading this and from the 28210-28211-28207 zip code, WW is the greatest bar ever invented by man or God.....",

    "text": "I'm going to start off by saying great atmosphere and a great rooftop bar... However the service is terrible! I went in with another girlfriend of mine around 11pm on a Friday night. We sat down at the bar downstairs (which wasn't overly crowded) and ordered a couple of drinks. We let the bartender know we were checking out their late night menu but needed a minute. After a few mins of talking we decided on some food to order and shots... It took the bartender at least 35-40 mins to come back to us. After she had helped almost every guy at the bar was it she noticed us waiting. We promptly asked for our checks without ordering anything further because at this point watching people walk up to the bar and get helped while we were sitting there waiting was beyond frustrating! On our way out we decided to walk upstairs in which we ran into a group of our friends who were having a going away party. We once again decided to try an order shots but the bartenders upstairs were to busy chatting and dancing to notice there were people waiting! No one wants to stand around waiting forever for a shot! Once again it's a great place to hang out but just don't expect any good customer service!! Already saw a bad review about being a female and trying to get service here and it's 100% True!",

    "text": "Let me be clear from the outset, the food is not great. The Barballo chicken wings are the best thing on the menu... That said, we love this place. Only go to the \"Top Shelf\" deck and generally from the outside stairs. The deck and the staff have a nice buzz..... and so do I after the 1/2 off wine on thursday. The deck is head and shoulders above ( literally and figuratively)  everything else in Midwood. service comes with genuine smiles, and they actually know what they are doing. Great deck, veiw, people watching....enjoy",

    "text": "We just returned from lunch at the new Whiskey Warehouse and based on the very few (as of this writing) reviews out there on the internet we didn't know what to expect. I have to say that I was pleased with the experience overall. We used to frequent the previous establishment at this location called Creation and wondered how they would change the layout and decor. Well, it's nothing at all like the former restaurant. It truly has the look and feel of a combination saloon and warehouse - hence the name (with a few high tech touches thrown in). A lot of dark woods and an open floor plan make it inviting and unpretentious. The long bar which goes nearly 3/4 of the length of the restaurant is sure to be one of the neighborhood's most popular draws.   Even with the small amount of people in there at 11:45 a.m. on a Wednesday I was surprised at the noise level. My dining partner and I had to talk loudly to be heard. I think it was partially because there was a large 50\" television with the volume on less than two feet from us coupled with the exposed ceiling and general openness that doesn't absorb sound. If that place ever fills up it will be ear shattering. At the very least they should mute all of the televisions so people don't have to talk over them - with the exception of maybe during Panthers games or larger events like the Superbowl.   My dining partner and I enjoyed the food but didn't partake in any libations since it was still the middle of the workday. We plan to come back for a happy hour sometime in the near future. I had the prime rib sandwich and sweet potato fries. I would grade both at about a B. The well-seasoned beef was shaved instead of a big slab and I preferred it that way. The bun was nothing more than a large hamburger bun and I would have preferred a nice Ciabatta bun or Sour Dough hoagie instead. I also would have liked more of a kick in the horseradish mayo. It was a bit tame and I could barely taste the horseradish. The sweet potato fries were good but unspectacular. I mean, they are just fries so there's not much you can do with them, but they were worth the $1 up charge. Portions for both the sandwich and fries were large. I really felt like I got my $9 worth. My dining partner had the Whiskey Glazed Salmon Salad. She was very happy with it. She was certain the salmon would be overcooked as most restaurants do but she was happy with how it was finished. Her salad was also a very large portion and she said she would definitely order it again...in her words \"a keeper.\"   The menu to us was just the right size. It was double-sided with about 30+ salad, sandwich and entree items plus 8 or so appetizers. There was a little something for every taste including vegetarians (but nothing vegan because of the dairy).   Again, we can't speak to the drink menu but it's clear they have just about anything you would want. There were a couple of drink specials written on the board so there is probably something for every budget too. I see this place becoming popular with the after work crowd. Since the bar is so large it seems like a nice place to belly up and hang out with coworkers and friends for a few cocktails on a Friday evening.   Service was fine. It was about what you would expect at your basic neighborhood restaurant - enough attention without feeling either swarmed over or neglected. Our water glasses were always full and the food was brought out in about 10 minutes.   I realize the place is new and has yet to develop a following but I was surprised at how empty it was at noon. It was just the two of us and a small group of firefighters from the next door station. There also appeared to be one of the owners or managers with a vendor at another table discussing business. But that was it the entire time we were there.   If this restaurant is to survive where others in this location have failed (and the owner is reading this) they need to get the word out aggressively. Word of mouth will only go so far. Consistently send around fliers to local businesses with drink specials and coupons and I predict they will fill the place very quickly. And if they keep serving good food with good service like they did today they will hit a home-run in the Plaza Midwood area.   I think 3 to 3.5 stars is appropriate. That doesn't mean it's bad, just not extraordinary. I'll call it above average. We will be coming back for sure.",

Every business in the neighborhood deals with a lack of parking and this just contributes to the problem, no matter if it's just one car. It does come across as a bit arrogant and won't sit well with the neighborhood over time.   That said, great place to go watch a game.",
