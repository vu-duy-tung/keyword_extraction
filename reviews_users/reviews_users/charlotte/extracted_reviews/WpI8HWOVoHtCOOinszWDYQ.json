Our table was toward the rear where the bus boys waited to clear the next table. My wife was very uncomfortable with them standing over us. We changed seats to help with that. Our food arrived very quickly and as stated the fried flounder my wife ordered was a lot of food for a small platter. It was a little too fishy tasting for her.My blackened Mahi was very tasty but very small, good thing I stuffed myself on the hush puppies. Knowing my wife we probably won't be back.",

    "text": "I've been on the search for an amazing seafood place I think I may have found it, but I want to try Mayflower Seafood Restaurant before I say I'm totally in love with this place.    Me and my girlfriend went here a couple of nights ago. When we came in and was seated I felt like it took unusually long for us to meet our waiter.  We were waiting for like 5-10mins. I understand she may have been busy, but I still think a hey I'll be your waiter I'll be with you in just a few minutes would've been okay. (My girlfriend just said I'm being impatient lol) but when she finally did come she brought us hush puppies (I love good HUSHPUPPIES) they came with honey butter and they were unlimited that right there already had me in awe. So I ordered my Fishermans Platter and my girl who isn't a fan of seafood ordered The     Grilled Chicken with a salad.  Her salad came with in minutes. I felt like our actual entrees took forever too come but our waitress kept our drinks full which I loved :) and she kept the HUSHPUPPIES coming.  The hushpuppies aren't the best in the world but ehhh I felt like they were a bit too hard for me and somewhat bland. Would've liked them to be more flavorful and fluffy . But after what seemed like 30-45 mins we finally  got out entrees.  My plate was stacked with fried everything I was amazed it was a lot of food for 17.99. I had jumbo shrimp which was great. Baby shrimp. A crab, oyster .  Everything on that plate was DELICIOUS!! And it was a lot I barely finished half before I had to call it in and get a container. OHH and the baked potato was good and well prepared wasn't all beat up and thrown in foil paper lol. And Hailee loved the chicken she said she wasn't expecting it to be soo good since it's a seafood joint but she let me get a bite and it was nice very very nice juicy and flavorful!!  I loved it all.  Overall, Food was amazing  service was mediocre.  I would definitely come back again!!! I want to try the Mayflower Seafood joint to see how it compares.",

The place was not super busy but in our section there were several families seated. The drinks took a little longer than usual. Then ordered apps for everyone. 2 shrimp cocktails, fried pickles (these are sliced lengthwise- so long & thin) & a bowl of she crab soup. I had a shrimp cocktail to start. Followed by rib eye steak with a side of jumbo shrimp ($5 extra) and French fries. My husband ordered a TBone with a side of Shrimp ($5 extra)  and a baked potato. We both also had salad.  I also tried fried pickles and she crab soup. Really liked the pickles (about 7of them). I've never tried she crab soup & this was ok, but the person who ordered said she has had better. When the dinner order got to us I got a baked potato not fries the TBone was well done not medium the sides of shrimp were spongy and tasted awful there was no taste to them. Tasted like they were microwaved. My bill was $121.18 plus the18% gratuity which they added to my bill! When we asked for a manager (George) came over and with a bit of an attitude staring the gratuity is written on the menu & posted at entrance. when we stated our grievances and explained all the issues we are going to tip her but the service wasn't worth 18% he got mad and took the receipt &  and stormed off. When he returned he handed me the receipt and stormed off not saying anything. I don't think I will ever eat at captain Steve's Seafood again if I and my family and friends are going to be treated like this.  We did leave her $13. For tip. It was the repeatedly having to ask for items we needed & it taking a long time which effected her tip. It's even more so the attitude of George that made the whole experience a fail!",

Both were really good. I had all you can eat crab legs with collards and a salad. The salad was good but the dressing could have been better. I had the greek dressing. The collards are ok they are really chopped and smokey. My crab legs where warm some were watery and had no taste, most of them were ok. They need something to keep the butter warm while you eat your crab legs, it was kind of cool in there so my butter kept turning into paste. My Wife had the Steve Platter it was loaded with shrimp, scallops, fish, and a grab cake. The crab cake was not good it had to much breading. For desert we had sweet potato pie, and key lime pie, both of them were good. I will be back for the fried oysters, fried shrimp, scallops, the key lime pie, and to try some other things on the menu.",

They need to make their own tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. The great fish camps in surrounding counties (Gaston, especially) does this and it sets them apart. It would be worth their time to develop these as what they have is not great and tastes like it comes from a jar. Homemade hush puppies would be great also.   2. The combination plates can be skimpy, based on what you order. If I go to long creek fish fry in Gaston County, jones fish camp in Caldwell county, or Lincoln Seafood in Lincoln County, you can expect 4-5 flounder filets and 6-8 chicken tenders on a combination plate. Here, I've ordered the same and received one small flounder filet and three tenders. That's not much compared to other camps in the area.   Overall, this place is recommended. The food is good and the workers at the takeout window are great!",

We did voice our disapproval of this as we did not see this in the entrance or on the menu but that was pointed out by the manager GEORGE who we asked to speak with. and his attitude towards us was less than professional. We told him that we believed she deserved a tip- just not 18% as we had several issues that had happened, we didn't want anything comp'd for us although some things should've been.  When you are spending $130 on dinner - the service and quality should've been a lot better! So he angrily took the recipt and removed the gartutity - when he returned and gave it back he did not say a word. NO apology or anything! So thanks George- your True colors tell me to never return and to not recommend anyone else to come!",

    "text": "Happened to be in Harrisburg and stumbled upon Captain Steve's Seafood Sag on a Friday.    First impressions was a fairly large, stand-alone restaurant, large parking lot so they can accommodate a lot of folks (well cars and then folks inside).  We were pretty early (11:30 am) so it was a bit sparse inside as far as the lunch crowd, but as we were waiting/eating our meal, the booths and tables started filling up.  Our server was very nice and had a lot of recommendations.  The menu is really simple, but there are a lot of options and really you can customize your meal to how you want it (very accommodating).  As you wait on your meal to arrive, a basket of hush puppies are delivered to your table with butter.  They aren't the typical \"large\" hush puppies, more like bites and they are pretty addictive.  WARNING:  most likely you will get hush puppies with your meal also, but it's a good thing!  I tried the salt & pepper catfish.... and when it came out it was a mountain of food!  I opted to have a half & half fries and onion rings combo... Everything was cooked right.... (you can't really mess up fried food too badly)  but it was just WAY too much food.  To top it all off, the restaurant manager sent out a honking slice of dessert (they were trying out) to the first few lunch tables of the day.  IT was a strawberry shortcake.  Very good - not too sweet and a good way to end an already ginormous food outing.  Needless-to-say I was in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon and no work was accomplished at my office.",

    "text": "I was not at all impressed by this restaurant. The food was bland, the service was nothing special, and the atmosphere was terrible.   The \"small\" seafood plate had more food than you'd ever imagine, if only they would switch from a quantity to a quality emphasis. The shrimp and onion rings had little to no taste and it was obvious that they weren't prepared fresh to order but instead were being kept lukewarm in the kitchen. My sweet tea tasted like it was made with warm hose water, and the hush puppies were subpar. None of the food was presented especially well, really it was all just thrown together.   When it comes to the atmosphere, it's strange. The whole restaurant is dark, and has a very dated feel. Also, I found it odd that the busboy was hovering near my table. It was absolutely creepy. It was almost like he was staring, which simply made we want to get out- ASAP.   I do not recommend this establishment, despite really wanting to enjoy it. There are very few seafood restaurants in or around Harrisburg, and it's a shame that this one is cannot meet even low expectations.",

My husband & I got the small order of shrimp and should have split it.  This was the small order! It was huge and I took half home for another meal. Also, one of my friends ordered the side salad which looked so good I wished I had ordered it but had way too much food already. Not your average side salad! Not your average seafood restaurant. Excellent! No complaints!",

They were coated with an awful seasoning. Had grilled shrimp to go with it. They were as rubbery as any I've had. But hey, I was hungry, so I ate it. Up half the night with unbelievable gas, and all day today with the trots!! Severe Trots!! So long Capt Steve, you sunk your own ship!!",

My mom got the broiled platter with jumbo shrimp and scallops and also had no complaints. She liked the lemonade.

Pete, the manager, said they normally don't take reservations, but he'd make an exception for this request. Our reservation was for 4:00 pm, which we arrived five minutes early. The hostess had no idea what my dad was talking about and that there was no reservations. We waited ten more minutes to be seated. The hostess brought us to a table for six, even though we had a party of nine. We pulled an adjacent table over to accommodate our group. My dad requested to speak to the manager. The manager on duty (he never gave his name) showed up and immediately asked \"What's the problem?.\" My dad told him he made reservations with Pete for my mom's 90th Birthday. This manager told us Pete was off this weekend and that the reservation was \"Pete's deal\". He stated that they don't take reservations because there too busy for that on weekends. He said \"too bad, what do you want me to do about it? Then he walked away. What ever happened to customer service? He never even apologized. We reluctantly stayed to enjoy my mom's Birthday. This was a big deal, mom's 90th Birthday, with immediately family. All of us came from out of town and out of state to be with her. The next time , oh that's right, there won't be a next time here. We'll gladly take our business somewhere else. This was sincerely the poorest customer service and the manager on duty should be retrained on his interpersonal and management skills.",

If your one of those guys, like me, who would rather have a buffet of some decent food over a barely half-filled plate of some fancy schmancy stuff, you may not want to go to a seafood joint that's landlocked. I mean, let's be honest, a seafood buffet is where it's at, and to find one it can be somewhat difficult in the Charlotte area. However, at Steve's, there are some damn filling portions of decent food if I must say so myself. Seems they pride themselves on their deep fried dishes, but that was expected. They also have healthier seafood options.  Service was great. Waitress was very attentive to the needs of our table. Venue is fairly loud, decor-wise, but adds to the feeling of being down at the beach. And what can be better than that?",

The wait staff is always polite and helpful, but as I have said before and will continue to stand by is free WiFi in restaurants. An eatery of this magnitude can easily put in a half way decent WiFi system. With that being said I have to give them a 4 Star rating. They have a pick 2 or 3 combo fried or broiled, which is excellent. I just have one question of why broiled costs more then fried and when you fry you need flour plus seasoning. That is Highway robbery but everyone does it these days, they say America is an Obese Nation. Maybe we wouldn't be Obese if the Healthier food wasn't over priced compared to fried food. Can anyone tell me how a baked piece of chicken cost more than a fried piece? I didn't think so, 2+2=4 not 5. You use more money on ingredients on fried chicken than baked chicken. Well enough of my ranting on the conspiracy of fried, baked, or broiled. The food here is great and they have mastered getting their wait times down so I highly recommend you trying them sometime.   Enjoy, I always do!!!",

She said multiple times \"That isn't bad, that's fine, nothings wrong with that butter, you can eat it.\" After about 3 times asking her to just get another one because we didn't feel comfortable eating it, bad or not, she finally went and got butter. After that, we got our food which was great other than the fact that you have to add salt to your fries or onion rings. While we ate, the waitress made us feel really uncomfortable by coming to us and asking us in a really nasty tone, \"is anything wrong with your food\". All in all, it's okay of you are willing to deal with having sub par food shoved down your throat like a kid at school lunch.",

We always order call-ahead take out to avoid the wait in both the takeout and sitting areas. We typically place the order at least 15 minutes in advance.   The food is always hot and fresh--never cold. The portions are ample with some to spare.  I always get the fried seafood. The flavor tends to be on the lackluster side and requires some doctoring (Old Bay and Ketchup) to make it good.   I typically order the jumbo shrimp and clam strips as they are my favorites.   Overall a good place to stop in if you're in the area and want seafood but not a destination per se.",

When you were on Monroe Rd you were great and I followed you to your current location and you remained an amazing place to eat. Coming here is a priority when I come home to visit because you are that wonderful!  To Yelpers what is good here??? literally everything, I like to get the fish sandwich and take the second filet off and save it for the next day because the portion is so big. My best friend loves the fried oysters and has even said they are the best she has ever had in her life from any fish camp out here. My parents like the perch and flounder and it is fried to perfection never soft always nice and crispy!  Over the course of about 12 plus years I have tried the entire menu here and you really can not go wrong with anything get it salt and peppered for extra flavor or just regular if you like things in the not so seasoned side I've had it both ways and it is wonderful. Definitely give this place a try if you're into southern seafood not a better fish camp for miles!!!!!",

I explained we'd been waiting for awhile and I'd like to complain, I asked if there was a corporate number she said no, this is a family owned and that because we ordered a steak well done that is what took so long, she was very nonchalant and we will NEVER go back there again.",

Our waiter, Reggie, appeared to be attentive at first. No wine served but our water and tea was delivered promptly but without the lemons that we had requested. We ordered our salads prior to the meal, as I explained it was date night and we wanted plenty of time to enjoy ourselves and the food. It wasn't two minutes into dressing our salads and beginning to cut them up when our food was delivered by someone other than our waiter. I was livid, as I had specifically reiterated that we did not want the food order to be placed until we were completely finished with our salads. Reggie showed back up finally and offered to put our food under a heat lamp. Thanks, but no thanks. We put our salads into to go boxes and proceeded to begin the meal. My first bite of oysters was horrible. Cold, greasy, and rubbery. The food was terrible. No refill on water or tea. Check delivered immediately. Had to wait to pay though. $43 wasted. Needless to say, save your time and money and go somewhere else! Will never be going back.",

My roommate and I had a craving for some seafood and boy was this our place!  Luckily, we got there before the parking lot was full and were seated very promptly.  I had read positive things about their small hush puppies, but didn't realize you get them as soon as you sit down.  They were definitely addicting and great to snack on as we perused the menu and waited for our food.  I got the small baby shrimp platter (fried) with a baked potato.  This was by far more than enough food for me and my roommate to split and possibly bring home leftovers still!  I can't imagine what the large is like.  My baked potato was delicious, as was the small creamy cole slaw that comes as a side.  The baby shrimp were bountiful and also delicious - I'm a big fan of cocktail sauce so I enjoyed that as well.  My roommate had the fried captain's platter and nothing but good things to say, again it was more than enough food to share.  Prices are very reasonable, especially for the portions.  Service was very friendly all around and they have plenty of wait staff to take care of you!    All around great experience, I look forward to returning in the future and possibly trying something from their broiled menu too!",

Fried flounder, scallops, jumbo shrimp, oysters, callbash shrimp and a crab cake was piled high on the plate. The fried oysters were the star but the scallops were solid too. So much food I couldn't eat it all. The Captain knows what he is doing!",

My coworkers and myself always utilize take out plates back to the office. The dining area is huge! Bathrooms are right near the front when you first walk in.   The only thing that I cannot stand is that for the popular two lunch specials (combinations), you cannot order scallops. I even asked the server if I can get them if I paid extra. I was told that I would have to order a bigger platter (the captain platter I think) that costs about $3 and offers less food items. I honestly don't understand that policy. If I want the combination platter am willing to pay extra, why can I not order some damn scallops? The captain platter gives more fishy options while I prefer scallops, shrimp, and clam strips.   I did order the bigger platter on my second visit just for the scallops and was underwhelmed. There weren't enough for a scallop lover (maybe 5 averaged sized scallops) and I don't really like fish but I had to get it.   They have good food overall and a good environment (kitchen times, servers, decor) so I can see myself returning with the coworkers. I would not return on my personal time... when I want my way and am willing to pay for the extra scallops, I should be able to order what I want, how I want it.",

    "text": "I had the most horrible experience ever at Captain Steve's in Harrisburg , NC on this past Saturday April 20, 2019. My family was visiting from out of state for the Easter holiday and I was so excited to share with them the experience of Captain Steve's as we are a seafood loving family. I often go to Captain Steves and I bragged to my family on the caliber of the food and the service that we would receive. You can imagine my shock when we experienced the most horrible service that I can ever recall receiving from any restaurant. We waited over 45 minutes to get our food and during that time our drinks were not re-filled by our server but another server who we had to flag down. After finally receiving our food and eating (the food was amazing), we had to wait an additional 20 minutes to get our checks which were not correct. When we were ordering our food, the waitress took down each person's name in order to separate the checks but somehow that information was lost by the end of our meal (a waste of time). What was the most disturbing was the attitude of the waitress who did not apologize  about the inconvenience and even was snappy at the end. Because I was hosting my family, I felt responsible for the bad experience. I asked the waitress was everything OK in a concerning tone and she replied \"yes, are you OK?\" with an attitude as she walked off.  When we finally did receive the checks, the waitress did not provide a pen to sign the receipt. It took another ten minutes for her to come back so we ended up having to walk around to find a pen to sign our receipts.   I will say that the manager did check on us but I would have appreciated it more if the manager would've just taken over from that point.  The customer service from the waitress was the worst that I have experienced. I'm not sure if I will be coming back to Captain Steve's ever again due to this customer service experience.",

Well, I guess we should've eaten the fried food because the grilled option wasn't good. It was just ok. I had the stuffed flounder. He had the shrimp and scallops but they were tasteless.  Seriously, this place reminded me of a glorified Red Lobster, but not as good. And I don't think RL is spectacular, if I want great seafood, I go to great seafood restaurants.

We were seated rather quickly and was immediately attended by the waitress Margie who helped us navigate through the menu. We chose to do the babyshrimp platter small and the catfish strips and jumbo shrimp platter.. with sides of fries and sweet potato.. hush puppies with butter were brought out as an appetizer and shortly after our food was brought to us.. the jumbo shrimp was EVERYTHING very delicious and I believe they make their own cocktail and tartar sauce. The catfish strips were really good and you could almost still taste the river in the catfish. I kind of like that let's me know that it's actually real. The sweat tea and lemonade are homemade and are really good try it as a mix for an Arnold Palmer. I really appreciated them for staying late to accommodate us. I will gladly return for the food as well as Margie's customer service.",

Got seated and the server was at our table with hush puppies within 5 minutes. I had my usual Captain Steve's platter (because I get to pack a to go container) because of the variety of seafood and the full plate of food that you get with it. There are shrimp, scallops, fish, coleslaw, french fries and oysters on the plate, and all are tasty. Don't order that unless you are hungry or greedy because it is a lot of food. The atmosphere is friendly, and like I said, it is a traditional fish camp type restaurant, so there are fish and model ships on all of the walls.

We tried another place and it just wasn't as good as our old places..   We have been twice and have had excellent service and food! The scallops are to die for. I have never had any better and they even out beat the ones that I got fresh in Florida. The jumbo shrimp are actually jumbo shrimp and they are so good. The onion rings are freshly made and wonderful!   The only drawback is that they definitely can get busy but that is a good thing. Just remember to prepare for a wait. We were a table of 2 and given 25 minute wait but ended up getting sat in less than 15 minutes.",

The plates come with a small serving of excellent cole slaw and a choice of one side. My wife had onion rings and I chose collard greens. The shrimp and scallops were large and cooked just right. Neither were overly breaded. And there were plenty of each, almost too.many. This brings me too my only complaints: no Senior menu! As we get older and the center of gravity slips, we need to watch how much we eat. In their defense, they do offer smaller plates BUT the small plates do not offer either jumbo shrimp or sea scallops so we were stuck order the full plate and either not eating it all or taking some home. Reheating fried food doesn't usually work that well for us so we would rather order Senior portions or will just share a single order next time, and there will be a next   We came back for lunch last Wednesday and, contrary to the negative reviews I've read, it was great. There was actually more catfish than we could eat plus slaw and sides of your choice for less than $7! Each plate had five-six catfish fillets that were cooked just right. We were fully satisfied. We even had enough for a great meal the next day.",

Our experience began with us being seated and quickly greeted by our server.  Our server delivered a basket of hushpuppies to the table before he took our drink orders.  The hushpuppies were wonderful.  They aren't flexible with allowing anyone over 10 to order from the kid's menu.  You can't order a salad as your side with a fish plate.  It made ordering a little difficult because I wanted a salad as my side but I didn't want to pay an extra $3.49 for a bowl of shredded lettuce.  I just got a baked potato.    Our meal came out pretty quickly.  It came out correctly.  My wife ordered a popcorn shrimp plate.  There was a copious amount of shrimp on the plate.  It was running over.  I got a pick two combination plate with flounder and deviled crab.  The flounder was good but the deviled crab was the star of that plate.  It was great.  I received two decent sized pieces of flounder and two deviled crabs.  The portion sizes are very generous.     The service was good.  He kept checking on us and he was very attentive to his other tables as well.  The place looked clean.  The parking lot was full so they must do something right!",

I usually go with the fried or blackened fish combo with blackened scallops, a salad, and the collard greens.  The greens are not fresh, probably frozen but they are seasoned really well and are my favorite side here.  The blackened fish and scallops are really good, not heavy like the fried.

    "text": "When you have to have really fresh and tasty seafood you must go to Captain Steve's. The wait is never too long no matter how many people you see waiting in the lobby. My go-to favorite is the combo plate with salt & pepper catfish (on the bone) and baby shrimp fried with fries or baked potato. The hush puppies are good as well. All of the staff are nice and friendly. I would give them 5 stars but at times it takes longer to get your food than it does to be seated on a super busy night! Otherwise, it's all good up in the seafood neighborhood!",

Our server was slow to arrive, but after our initial order she did a great job keeping tabs on us, filling drinks, etc.  This is a family fish-camp place, nothing fancy.  The plate sizes are huge.  I had a small shrimp/flounder platter.  Had enough shrimp for dinner the next day!",

If you are getting fried seafood definitely get the salt & pepper breading!! Good flavor and large portions at a great price.",

I'm just going to give them an award now for best fried jumbo shrimp. I eat an inordinate amount of seafood so trust me here.   I've been coming here for years and I still don't have a photo of the food. Why you ask? Because I'm focused man! Lol. I'm busy stuffing my face.   The decor is of a normal fish fry place. Nothing fancy and a bit older. The staff is always super nice and helpful. It has a nice family feeling. See you all again soon fam. Lol",

The second time I got the stuffed flounder. It tasted like it was stuffed with a crab cake. I loved the flavor. The meals come with a salad and a side. Since it is seafood, expect higher prices. However, you get a lot of food for the price!   I think the lemonade is some of the best in town. They just changed the recipe apparently. I liked it a little better the first time, but it's still great. The service is top notch. They are very attentive and personable. They always offer to get you a fresh drink in a to go cup when you're leaving. No wonder this place is always packed...Even at 3pm! I'll be back soon!",

The grilled fish was great, and the sirloin steak, surprised how good it was!   fried catfish whole was tasty but tiny, we asked waitress before ordering and she told us it was medium sized, it was not.  Their salad that comes with only about  half the entrees is very nice as well as the salad dressing. I had a grilled shrimp salad and it was very good with lots of shrimp.   Overall we like this place and find it a welcome addition and not overpriced. I think the food is above average for this area.    I think the wait staff could use some improvement and a vegetable added to the menu would be good  Im sure they are still working out the kinks!  Give it a try I think you will like it.",

It was a $1 up charge. IMO, the shouldn't have charge me $1 for the sweet potato when they didn't have any regular baked potatoes ready. It still took an extra 10 minutes for the sweet potato and it came out over cooked. Our waitress was attentive, but I felt sorry for the other customers. Their waitress was constantly had her boyfriends table. She must have gone over to his table 15 times while we were there and he had already had his food served before we even sat down. She was very attentive to him, brought him out a baked potato, onion rings, rolls, etc to go with his meal. She must have filled the condiments at his table at least 3x while we were there.  When I went to the bathroom after we ate, the custodian was emptying the trash and cursing up a storm with the hostess. She saw me and they both just laughed. Neither one of them apologized for their language or for me having to wait to use the restroom. Now I am all for a clean bathroom, but I shouldn't have to listen to young adults cuss up a storm while I wait. There was no manger on site. Seems the restaurant is run by teens and young adults.",
