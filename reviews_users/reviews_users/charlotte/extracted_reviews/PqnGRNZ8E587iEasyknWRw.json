My acai bowl was delicious.   Owner(s), you need to re-evaluate your mobile application. I have ordered many acai/smoothie bowls before, but never from this establishment. I chose \"Acai Bowl\" and saw there was a drop downs for \"Add-ons\", so I chose \"Pineapple\" from the drop down. I included my phone number in the designated area (I had assumed in case they had a question about your order), then went to the store. My order was not ready upon my arrival because they did not understand my order. I was very confused by this because I just chose from options that were presented to me. They said I should have typed either \"frozen pineapple\" or \"fresh pineapple\" in the comments area. Why would I know this if the app only has \"pineapple\" as an option, then does not instruct me to specify? I've always assumed add-ons for these bowls go on top, so I've never thought that there would be a need to specify between different types of pineapple. Additionally, the employees said they do not have a way to see the phone number I included with my order - they can only see what I ordered. What is the point of the phone number section if the employees can't call during these types of situations?  Overall I had a good experience.",

They used pre-juiced beet, ginger and lemon all from the plastic containers they store it in. And once again, Martinellis brand apple juice.

When I think of juicing, I think super healthy, super fresh, super clean.  The people here are super friendly and I was able to get a free juice when I brought in a coupon from a snail mail-er, so was worth giving a shot.  My two main gripes is that when they're making the juice, you can see them pulling all the ingredients out of boxes and cans and bottles and are frozen - which kind of takes away from the whole \"fresh\" idea. I would suggest they put all the ingredients in unlabeled clear containers so that it really feels like you're getting something not manufactured.  Also, they don't have any notices for allergies (I'm allergic to nuts and soy) and so they had already made the shake before I realized it was made with almond milk, which I can't eat.  Luckily, they  made me a new one, but something for future reference.",

My rating is 4 stars because the bowl isn't always consistent (one time they were out of avocado, toppings vary in quantity, another time I got frozen banana chunks at the bottom of the bowl).

The staff was very nice and apologetic. Maybe a suggestion I would give is wearing hair nets while handling food because hair naturally sheds. Sad to say I won't be going back.",

I just moved here from the West Coast where acai bowls are a huge trend and one of my favorite places had prices between $5.50-$9.50 depending on the size. The one I tried here ( go green) was not my favorite. Very liquidly and tart.    I did also try the trio of juice shots (grand slam) which I will say I enjoyed. It's nice to have a pick 3 option to get all of your juice shots in.   I used to receive text messages with discount codes but I haven't seen any recently. The employee that day told me they were randomly sent.   Overall this place is ok but not something I would go out of my way for.",

I can sympathize with my fellow reviewers who felt ripped off by the acai bowls, but with Rico's Acai having several locations in Charlotte, it's kinda like, just go there, you know? Come to the Juice Bar for juice.  I hate to pay $10 for a non-alcoholic (or hell, even an alcoholic) beverage as much as the next girl, but when you consider trying to make one of these smoothies on your own, the groceries would easily add up to right about the same cost. I watched my smoothie being made and they loaded what looked to be about 3 pounds of straight produce into the blender.   I got the basic green smoothie - can't remember what it was called - and my boyfriend got The Doc. I tried both and while mine was sweeter, The Doc had a nice, gingery spice to it. Be warned that while The Doc has kale, it is actually a dark purple color, which was unexpected. Both smoothies were delicious, and I hate to say it, but worth every penny.   Bonus points because our drinks got up-sized to Larges for free! Not even sure why, but it was a very nice gesture.   For an occasional healthy treat, I would definitely come back to the Juice Bar! Great customer service and a quality beverage product.",

    "text": "Please note: this review is ONLY about their acai bowl. I will update it if I try other items from their menu.  I don't usually leave a review for a place I've only been to once, but I went specifically for acai, and knowing the limited amount of acai in this town, the people deserve to know.  Juice Bar is an absolute ripoff. I say that as someone who is HAPPY to pay close to $12 for a good bowl - but not this nonsense. To start, it is ridiculously small (see my photo for scale). When I saw her pouring the acai blend into the bowl, I was shocked. It's about 1/3 the size of what I'm used to (same size as Rico's small, I believe). With a price tag of $9+, I was annoyed already.  Next was the presentation. Now, I don't need every bowl to be \"insta-worthy.\" But when an excessive amount of granola is dousing the bowl, and precisely four blueberries and 5 slices of strawberries top your bowl, it feels like you're being pranked. I recognized the granola, which means it was likely commercially made. The almond butter was good, but it was down at the bottom of my bowl, which is unusual. Zero effort for presentation or even equal distribution of toppings.  Finally, the flavor. Nothing special. I added protein powder ($2!!! what! plant protein is NOT that expensive) and the flavor just wasn't impressive.   One positive? Their smoothies and prepared food LOOK good. Again, pricey, but if the flavor and execution are better, that may bring the rating up. But I will not be buying their acai again.",

Well, I was surprised when she said 3.50. I said that's not right because it's 5 off. She said well it's tax. I said over a $1 in tax. So then she tapped it down to $2.71. I knew it wasn't right.  I paid then I asked for a receipt. I asked if I have a receipt option, and she said \"I text it to you and emailed it, we're paperless here.\" And she proceeded to help the next customer. I moved out of the way and pulled it up (the email), and the attached picture shows I didn't get $5.00 off. Just $4.50 off after I questioned the price.  I took my concern to the other front staff, and they asked the cashier to pull up the transaction. She told them \"I didn't know how to take $5 off.\" I showed them my emailed receipt showing I didn't get my full discount. The gentleman handed me $.50 and said \"does this help?...I'm sorry...\" I told him he should not have to apologize for someone else's rudeness. It should not matter if I had a coupon for 5 cents off or 5 dollars off... I should get my full discount.  I also said I would not come back because I didn't do anything for her to treat me like that. Then the cashier said \"I'm sorry if you took it that way sweetheart\" in a very sarcastic tone. I told her I'm not her sweetheart and that's not how you apologize. She wanted to carry on mumbling things while her staff was repeating to her to stop talking to me that way. I repeated again that I would not come back if this is the treatment you get for using a coupon and questioning it if the math is wrong!",

It has lots of different kinds of juices and smoothies (both green and non-green, if you're not into that). It also has a variety of health shots and food (such as acai bowls and salads in the fridge area). Everything I've tried has been pretty good. Sweet Greens is a great juice for those who want to drink their greens but don't like that taste too much. Ginger Greens has a little kick: it's delicious! Orange You Glad and the beet one (can't remember the name) are great as well - quite sweet, though. Also, I have had a few of the salads from the togo fridge and they are good! Not filling enough for a large meal, but a good small bite.   Another thing to note is that Juice Bar has a pretty good rewards program for regulars: every 9th (or 10th?) juice is free. Also, the staff here is so nice! We sometimes bring our little dog in and they are so sweet and accommodating. Thanks guys!",

I just recently got into juices and smoothies, so I'm making the rounds through all the spots in Charlotte.  Juice Bar just blows them all out of the water.  First, the juices are great.  I also like that there are the calorie counts on the menu board so you can figure out how you want to allocate your daily allowance.  My go-to is the Sweet Greens.  It's a little higher in calories because of the apples, but it's delicious and fills you up.  As an alternative, try the Pineapple Greens.  Still sweet but lower in calories.  Second, I just signed up for their check-in, so after 9 purchases, your 10th juice is free!  Everyone at both this Juice Bar location and the other one in town are so incredibly friendly.  They must treat their employees well, because they treat the customers well.  Maybe at some point I'll try one of their healthy snacks, or maybe even do one of their juice cleanses...maybe.",

They have juices, smoothies, and a short list of bowl type food items as well as to go snacks.    There is a nice bright sitting area and bar counter in the front, but don't miss the comfy couch area toward the back.  And they have wifi! :)",

    "text": "As a general business model, I don't understand how juice bars have become so popular. They are pricey and pretty much everything they offer can be made at home without much effort/commitment. Still, on occasion it's just more convenient to grab a juice or smoothie to go, so here we are.   I've only been here three times and each time has left me feeling entirely underwhelmed, mainly because it has taken at least 15 minutes to get my order. I could've gone to Harris Teeter, bought the ingredients, and made it myself in roughly the same amount of time. So much for convenience.   They do have a pretty varied menu which is nice. And I've always been pleased with the quality of my juice and/or smoothie. The staff is friendly, too, so it's not that it's horrible. I just think it's a bizarre concept to begin, made even more so by the slow turn around.",

    "text": "Great spot to grab a fresh juice/smoothie/juice/shot/juice cleanse. The menu has tons of delicious-sounding options and if you're stuck on a couple, feel free to ask the staff! They will help you narrow down your choice(s) or introduce you to one you didn't even consider!  The latter was what happened to me during my visit. I couldn't decide between two, all I knew was that I wanted a smoothie and for it to contain mint/ginger. The guy behind the counter told me that the 'mint to be' was his favorite so I figured, 'why not?!' and ordered a small.   There are two sizes for the juices and smoothies: small and large. A large juice/smoothie will run you close to $10 which I find sliiiiightly ridiculous but that's the price you pay for convenient, fresh juice.   Besides the juices, there's a refrigerated section that boasts pre-cut fruit (watermelon, pineapple, etc), yogurt & granola parfaits, wraps, sandwiches, even fresh coconut! They sell these hockey puck sized bars that are delicious! They're in gold packaging near the cash register and will keep you full for a while!  Depending on the time of day, this place can get packed so pack your patience!",

I'm partial to the \"very strawberry\" which has apple juice mixed with strawberry and banana. It's definitely a different, lighter twist. It is a bit pricey, so this is more of a treat than an everyday thing for me.",

    "text": "I'm not new to the juice life. Finally got to check this place out! I'm normally by them on Sunday's and they are closed! We walked in and asked the lady at the counter what juice she recommended. She was like I get smoothies, so really offered us no help there. That's when Tyree stepped up and showed us the ropes there. He was very helpful, kind, patient. He asked us if we would like to sample some, and let us sample some of every juice they offer. That's what's up! They have some good juices there. He also told us what was popular and recommended his favs to us as well. / they also have smoothies, and bowls. / we tried: the coffee Janet smoothie & the beet juice. Both were good! I also was impressed with their prices. Bc as you know, eating & drinking healthy isn't cheap. But compared to some other juice places they were cheaper. Small range $6-7. Large $7-9.75. All their bowls were under $10 with some even being $5-6. They do a loyalty type program where you enter your number and after 10 visits you receive a free large juice or smoothie. They also have a couple couches in the back by the restrooms. Nice little nook, with books, puzzles, Jenga.",

    "text": "Went here hoping to get a tasty fresh juice. I asked for a a green juice without parsley. The cashier asked the other staff member if that was possible. The other staff member replied, \"Yeah no problem! I'll just put the base in there!\" I paid $7 for the small juice and then was told when I got the juice I only had cucumber and pineapple juice due to the base having the parsley in it. I was very disappointed.   Unfortunately my juice only tasted like cucumber. I really don't know if it had any pineapple in it.   Staff was nice, just didn't dress very professionally. They all wore what they wanted-not even a company logo shirt.",
