I would highly recommend Pokeatery for anyone who is looking for a tasty, fresh, and healthy meal.",

Even though I've been to all the poke spots I could think of in Charlotte, this one by far is on top of the list!  Not only that, the owner, Lee came by and introduced us to other ingredients on the menu that was new to us. Also don't forget to check in on Yelp to get yourself a free miso soup!

    "text": "I'll start by saying POKE is my FAVORITE thing ever! I eat it at least once a week... you could probably call me obsessed! I was so excited for this place to open up but after my first experience I wasn't overall that impressed. They offer one size and it's HUGE which just isn't very lunch friendly. They also break up the ingredients and only let you mix in a few things then add the rest down the line... some of the toppings I would want mixed in are at the end. I know they are on the new side and maybe the employees will gain confidence with the ingredients but I asked about a few things and the employees seemed confused. I think they have a huge market because people are so into Poke right now but they are quite expensive. I think they need to caterer a little more to the lunch crowd since they are in the Uptown area and to do that they need to offer a smaller size. Please swap the order of your line around and put the ingredients before the sauce maker. I'll try it again in a few months to see if they have improved but for now I'm loyal to Poke Bar!",

Only thing I would possibly do differently during my next visit is maybe ask for more rice and instead of getting 4 proteins maybe go with 2. But I really enjoyed my bowl. Portions are great. I ate off of my bowl twice. Will definitely be back to try the dole whip(?).",

The pineapple whip is just as good as the actual whip I had from the Dole farm in Hawaii and from Disney. So get it.  The only thing I'd do different if I was them - the cup they give you for water is a shot glass size so I'd put out a water dispenser so customers don't have to keep coming up to the counter for water, especially during a lunch hour rush.",

I wound up at Pokeatery in Epicenter and after perusing the menu, ordering and eating, all I could think is, \"So where were you when I used to office Uptown on the regular?!?\".    My experience was being served by a row of friendly faces all who had \"Trainee\" on their name tags and all of whom had clearly been well-trained.  There were no hiccups in the process and I quickly was served a box prepared just as I ordered it.  Tried one of their signature boxes and since I like heat, it was the Volcano Crunch version.  It delivered nicely both on heat as well as overall textures and flavors.  The fish and shrimp was quite fresh which is obviously priority #1 for a Poke joint.  I very much enjoyed every bite.  Assuming this is a chain by the looks of it but if it is, as time has rolled on that does not necessarily mean \"stay away\" like it used to back in the day.  Chain or not, it's worth the time and money.",

While they're currently in the soft opening phase (grand opening in January), I was pleased all around with my first experience.   I went in about 1 PM on a Tuesday & there was only one person in line. You chose either prefixed poke bowls or you can make your own. Two helpful ladies behind the counter get all your decisions together in a nice little container.  Quite pricey lunch ... mine was $12.95, avocado is $1.00 extra.  I enjoyed everything, but the seaweed salad taste was off, for me. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best, either. Perhaps an off day for it.  Good deal of seating for those that want to dine in. Clean & atheistically pleasing.  I'll definitely continue to dine here.",

I will have to say that I think this take on poke is a little unique compared to all the other places. It's more compartmentalized, which I like. I went with the kids portion, which was a perfect price and size for lunch. Came with two proteins and a side. For my side, I got spicy edamame and my proteins were ahi tuna and spicy tuna. I added loads of other toppings and sauces making it super delish and for me. I do love that they don't charge extra for additional toppings (besides avocado) and sauces so you can really mix and match!  Everyone working was very helpful. Definitely will be added to my lunchtime eating out rotation!",

Once inside the place has a nice set up with a good amount of seating but it is pretty small compared to the other food places in the epicentre. At my turn I did the BOGO offer they had and decided to go for two of their signature bowls which were the Surfer and the Workout.  I got them both actually how they came, but when it came to the sauces the girl didn't want to give me extra when I asked. So I asked again, she finally put the smallest bit more and said \"ugh it's too much\" under her breath. And I think that made the biggest difference in my bowls because they were bland and might as well didn't have any sauce on them because I definitely didn't taste any wasabi citrus, I couldn't tell you in the slightest what their signature sauces tasted like, and I didn't even get the drizzle of spicy mayo. In my pictures you can't even tell sauce is on it. I ended up just making my own sauces to go on it when I got home. The only good thing I liked was the spicy crab salad & the seaweed salad. I also got the free miso soup for checking in on Yelp & it was just as bland as ever. So for the checkin definitely go with the Dole whip because that was really good and taste like fresh pineapples. Overall I was highly disappointed in all the blandness of the food and most likely won't go back.",

I chose the house sauce for the poke bowl and a side of miso soup.   The poke bowl was fresh and very tasty.  The citrus kale was a great option.  The sauce was pretty mild - I would either ask for extra or add another sauce for some additional flavor.  The miso soup was essentially onion water.  There was no miso flavoring to it - it was truly inedible.  I'm assuming there was just something off about how it was prepped that day -- but, I probably won't take that chance again.

I had The Workout (brown rice, kelp noodles because they ran out of citrus kale, cucumber, green onion, white onion, seaweed salad, spicy garlic edamame, ahi tuna, salmon, hamachi, albacore, spicy mayo sauce, pickled ginger, massage, edamame beans, furikake, and wasabi, $12.95). The price is high, especially considering that there are several other poke spots in Charlotte to compete with. I was also told to \"like\" them not their Facebook page in order to also receive a free small bowl of miso soup. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. I would have preferred to have only shelled edamame instead of a mix of both edamame still in the shell and also edamame that had already been shelled. It just doesn't seem to make sense to have both. I also would have preferred to have the wasabi on the side instead of touching all the other ingredients. The miso soup was a great addition. Can't wait for the official grand opening!",

The tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna were very fresh with big chucks of each.   I would also recommend putting the spicy crab salad in your bowl, added the perfect amount of spice to the dish.  I also added the wasabi citrus sauce to my bowl. The portion sizes are big, so you will not leave feeling hungry, like at most other poke restaurants I have eaten at.  The strawberry and pineapple ice cream was some of the best I've had as well.   I will definitely be returning to eat at this restaurant.",

The regular portion was very filling! It comes with 4 proteins and 2 sides. I doubled up on the ahi tuna and salmon. Sides I did the cucumber salad and spicy edamame. Don't let the word spicy scare you if you don't like heat, it's pretty mild. The citrus kale is bomb and a great base option if you're looking for an alternative to rice.  Love how customizable it is and the number of options! I will be back!!!  It is hard to find as someone else mentioned. It's on the second floor near Moes and Smoothie King.",

I LOVED diving into a bowl of luscious, sweet fish, covered with some spicy sriracha mayo, refreshing cucumbers, carrots, rice, greens, soy and avocado (or whatever flavor we tossed on that day). It was a bad relationship. I'd come out craving poke... the next day, and the next...and the next.   I know it's bad, but I once poke'd for 10 days straight. We never had any issues, no matter where we ate. We shared times with friends, with family, at the movies, late night downtown, at the beach, and, oh gawd, the intimate time in front of the fireplace.   Well, no more.  Pokeatery has single-handedly crushed my poke passion.   Flavorless. Mushy. Poor quality fish. And well...just really not done well.",

We got there about 30 minutes before they opened and made it within the first 100 that got a free poke bowl. It was a long wait, but they were moving through the line quickly.   The have some of the best variety of toppings compared to the other poke places in Charlotte which I loved. I got a citrus kale base which was really good. 4 proteins seems like a lot, but their scoops are very small, so I do feel like you don't get a ton there.   It's Chipotle style build your own bowl with suggested bowls like most other poke places. They also have Dole whip for free if you check in on Yelp. They let us upgrade them to floats. They were good for a few sips, but way too sweet. I think it would have been better if it weren't dairy free so that it wouldn't be pure sugar. They also have pokado toast which sounded good but we didn't try.   Everyone working there was very friendly and there were fun free giveaways for the grand opening.   We both really enjoyed our poke bowls. I would definitely come back again, especially over the other food choices in the epicenter.",

    "text": "Had to think long and hard about how to rate this place. Definitely want it to succeed because it is the only poke bowl venue in Uptown and I love being able to walk to my grindz. On the other hand, my poke-native standards refuse to let me incorporate hope into the mix. This place was a three. Good enough to satisfy a desperate craving but nothing I could bring a friend to without embarrassment.   Went initially for lunch but the line was so long I gave up and went to Hibachi across the way. When I went back in the evening, it was less crowded but still not fast. The service felt like that scene from \"Dude Where's My Car?\" with an endless line of bored faces saying, \"An den? An den? An den an den an den!\" I was particularly miffed by one staff member who went through the motion of sprinkling furikake on my bowl, looked down to see that ZERO furikake had come out of the shaker, shrugged and put the shaker down and gave me that \"Next?\" look. Um, no. I want my furikake. Paying was easy although it seemed like getting a fountain drink or froyo might be troublesome. They have Hawaiian Sun, just do that.   How was the food? Well, I was glad to see the variety. But the fish was soggy. Like it had been frozen a long time. That's a serious no-no in my book. And the kelp was bitter (better warm than cold anyway), and the limu was slimy. Again, more no-no's. But the brown rice was steaming and they had furikake (which I eventually got after making a little scene...). The crab salad (imitation crab and mayo) was interesting and abundant and my companion thought that was the highlight of the meal. Not a good sign, folks. No one got sick and it was a brightly lit place and the flavors are reminiscent of home. Not, you know, amazing, but will combat the homesickness in a car-free pinch.   It was expensive for the quality, a decent quantity once you account for the sides (not the amount of actual sashimi), and the location cannot be beat. I'm going to use my free miso/Dole whip coupon in the spring to give them another try, see if they've figured out the service and texture things. It's not poke, but about what you might expect for the Mainland: Subway style sashimi in sauce with sides.",

I'm a sucker for buffets because I love options and this place is right up my alley. Just has much better quality than buffets.   This was my first taste of Poke and I'm not a fan of raw fish but since there were other protein options, I gave it a try. So amazed by how delicious it all is.  I chose BYO and put all the appetizing items on it. The ordering process  is just like that of Chipotle where you get to see them make your bowl. Everything looked and tasted delicious. Well except for the miso soup. I didn't like it. There wasn't any seaweed in the soup, just a couple macerated pieces of soft tofu and green onions in a bland broth. Luckily it was free with my Yelp check in so no harm done. I still give this place 5 stars for the amazing food. Tip: if you like spice, try a blend of wasabi citrus and spicy ono sauce.

However, I saw the great Pokeatery reviews and decided to tried it for lunch! I'm so happy I did!   The place was super clean and welcoming! The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in. They had plenty of options to pick from - including BYO and pre-made bowls- they have had a little grab and go section.   I decided to go with BYO and was surprised on how many add ins it included! Here's a break down of what I got all for $12.95: -White rice  -Two scoops ahi tuna (note I love spicy tuna, but there's is not chunked here - I'm not a fan of that but my co-worker was all about it) -Two scoops salmon  -Seaweed Salad -Spicy Crab -Cucumbers -Edamame  -Cilantro (I love lots!) -Mango -Roe -Sesame Seeds -Topped with citrus soy/Himalayan sea salt -Side of spicy mayo  Dear god that was alot but the flavors were so good and the fish was fresh. Although it's a little pricey for a quick lunch, I thought the value was so worth it! I could not finish my meal and would rate it highlight as one of the top new Poke places in CLT.  I will definitely be back for lunch, and I hope it lasts! We needed a place like this in the city for lunch!   Note: they also have DOLE WHIP and it's free with your Yelp check-in. I noticed after the fact... and they also do online/call ahead orders if you're picking up or in a rush!",

I will say that being our 1st timers the staff didn't seem interested in helping us understand the concept or how to get it started...we even asked a couple times and told them it was our 1st time having Poke. They spoke very quickly and quietly.  The Place was Very clean and loved they gave us a free Miso Soup for our check in on yelp. The miso soup was very flavorful...would love this on a chilly day or even when not feeling well. Just wish I would have looked into more before I went because it's laid out like Subway, so it was a little confusing to my husband and I. So I just decided on the Original Bowl",

    "text": "Let me be honest, I really was unsure if I wanted to eat at Pokeatery. I rarely step out of my comfort zone and do not enjoy foods with unusual textures (e.g. sushi). Nevertheless, my boyfriend swore I would enjoy Poke. Pokeatery is in a great location in the epicenter and has a sleek look. The employees were kind, answered all my questions, and were very patient. My boyfriend ordered a classic bowl and I ordered the volcano crunch bowl (I love spicy food). Additionally, I ordered the strawberry cucumber lemonade. It took me awhile to overcome the texture (I preferred the smaller chunks of ahi tuna over the bigger chunks), but overall I really liked it. I especially enjoyed the white rice's and strawberry lemonade's flavor. My boyfriend and I decided we would definitely come here again. However, I believe I would just order the same thing and not branch out any further!",

I got the volcano roll (it is VERY VERY spicy, so consider this your warning). But it is delicious! I will be back for more!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this new poke place in Uptown; it's located upstairs on the 2nd floor of the center right in front of the bridge to Bank of America Plaza.  Hopefully that helps because I wandered around for a good while looking for this place.  The lines weren't crazy during a weekday lunch rush hour.  I checked in on Yelp for a free miso soup (basically instant miso soup where they hit a button and soup comes out into a cup - yikes) or a free Dole whip (I had a sample and the REAL Dole whip is infinitely better).  Service is efficient.  Workers seemed friendly enough.  You build your own bowl here or you can choose to have one of their signature bowls on the menu.  I built my own with citrus kale, mixed greens, spicy (imitation) crab, seaweed salad, hot signature sauce, a bunch of toppings, and 4x salmon (you get 4 proteins for the regular size bowl).  At first taste, my initial reaction was \"this tastes like food poisoning ready to happen\".  The fish was super fishy tasting and obviously did not taste fresh.  I had just tried Ohana Poke the week prior and their fish quality was much better.  It also had absolutely ZERO taste to it.  I didn't watch them put the sauce in the bowl, but I do remember them asking me which one so I assume they put some in there, but it was so bland that I had to douse soy sauce on the fish.  I've never had bland poke anywhere.  Isn't that the point of poke in the first place - that it's well marinated?  Otherwise you might as well chop up some sashimi and put it in a salad and call it a day.  Very, very disappointing.  They also put a ridiculous amount of crab salad on your plate.  Even the people behind me were making faces when they saw that it was a giant ice cream scoop of imitation crab which was not tasty in my opinion.  The \"citrus\" kale had some weird white creamy sauce all over it that didn't taste like anything, let alone citrus.  I really wanted this place to work out so I could have more lunch options in Uptown, but probably the worst poke I've ever had.",

She was patient with me while I created my build your own bowls. The portions were generous! I also grabbed a Dole Whip because how am I supposed to resist a frozen pineapple treat?? $33 for two build your own bowls with avocado and the Dole whip. If I'm back uptown and craving a little sushi, I will be back. Their grand opening is posted for Jan 12 with specials if you've seen them on social media and we're considering giving them a try!",

Granted a sushi roll at a Japanese restaurant is $12-$15 and being able to build your bowl and choose 4 proteins makes it seem better. I ended up spending $17 on a build your on poke bowl + the Hawaiian drink they offered that is non carbonated. The staff was very kind and welcoming! I'll have to really crave a poke bowl to want to go back. However, I will treat myself to their dole whip occasionally.",
