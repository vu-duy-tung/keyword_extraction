    "text": "Dogwood Southern probably doesn't need another good review but we just had an excellent lunch experience. Should I start with the service or the food? Both were excellent.  We were looked after by Allison. Service is clearly a priority of the restaurant. Allison was attentive as you'd expect at a nice restaurant. Always there when needed. Allison knew the menu inside out and was not shy in making recommendations. All good choices.  The lunch menu is not overly extensive, which means the food is excellent and all three dishes we ordered where extremely tasty; good size portions, beyond flavorful and True to the menu description. Many if not most of the dishes support local growers and farmers.  This is a good looking space with plenty of ambience and a large bar - so probably good for many types of occasions.  We did get recognized by the staff as regular restaurant goers with a digestif. That was a nice touch at a reasonably priced lunch.",

    "text": "Love!!   Surrounded by other great restaurants in a one mile radius, Dogwood has some serious competition... but after my dinning experience there, I am convinced that they have nothing to worry about as long as they keep up what they're doing!   Phenomenal food and even better service.  I adored the place from the minute I walked in. The ambiance is warm and inviting, while lively at the same time. The wine menu is on an iPad, which makes browsing through the list more enjoyable! The severs were so pleasant. We ate there during restaurant week, which gave us the opportunity to try a few different things. I loved the roasted mussels, and quite enjoyed the tomato and goat cheese baguette appetizer. While they ran out of the mahi I ordered, they replaced it with another similar white fish which was delightful. From all the courses I was least impressed with the dessert, but that's not to say it wasn't good. I had the toasted pound cake, which tasted good, but was a bit too heavy for my liking.   I'm going back soon with an empty stomach; they have way too many terrific sounding dishes that I need to try, and an impressive cocktail menu that I didn't get to explore on my first visit!",

    "text": "Dogwood does not disappoint. My husband and I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant out since moving to the area a few months ago. Our entire experience - from the moment we walked in the door - was perfect. In addition to excellent food, we loved the rustic-modern decor and the friendliness of the staff.   Because every dish on the menu is so appealing, we found it difficult to determine what to order. Should we get all small plates? Should we get entrees and share? Thankfully, our server (Kevin) offered a great suggestion - get 2 or 3 small plates, and split a salad and entree. This was perfect for the two of us and we truly loved every bite of each dish!  For our small plates, we ordered the crab pups and baked pimiento cheese. The crab pups were delicious and surprisingly light - a nice combo of hushpuppies and crab cake. We were especially excited for the pimiento cheese, which is an item that we like to try at every restaurant if it's available.  And of course, it was absolutely to die for. So creamy and the perfect ratio of spice and pepper to cheddar. It was a generous portion - suited well for a party of 4.   After the two small plates, we were glad that we decided to split the shrimp & grits. We both received hearty portions of creamy, beautifully seasoned grits topped with shrimp, chorizo and a light gravy. I loved how light the dish was; it wasn't smothered with overly spicy tomato sauce or cheese like many other versions of shrimp & grits out there.   Finally, we ended the night with the fluffiest, airiest, most delicious cheesecake either of us have every had. It has truly ruined us for other cheesecakes.   One last note on the excellent service we received. Besides having a very attentive and knowledgeable server, we also enjoyed the perfect timing of the service. Our glasses were always full, dishes were cleared in a timely manner, and the rate at which dishes arrived at our table was absolutely perfect.   This was a great experience for my husband and I, and we look forward to returning very soon. We'll be singing Dogwood's praises to all of our friends!",

    "text": "Underwhelming & incorrectly priced.   Ambiance: They were hosting Wesley Walls birthday party in the room next to the bar. That took up basically the entire bar so there was no place for us to get a drink before our 8pm reservation. Very LOUD! Impossible to hear anyone you are speaking to at the bar and in the dining room you can't enjoy your company if you are in a large party, as all tables as rectangle.   Food: overpriced & underwhelming. $35 for 4 scallops. $42 for a ribeye that was 30% fat. Brussels sprouts were almost to salty to eat. Only stand out was macaroni & cheese. Everything else tastes like you would get from the frozen section of Harris Teeter.   Service: we had a party of 8 & the waiter tried his best to keep up. However he yelled down our throats the entrees because it was so loud in there and never let us ask any questions regarding the flavors.",

    "text": "Changed our Tip amount!!! This review would have been 4 or 5 stars because we had a great time at Dogwood, however our server was slow, possibly over-stretched during lunch so our tip reflected that. (13% instead of 15% tip). Later when our card statement showed the charge had cleared, someone had changed the tip amount to give themselves the full 15%. I figured this might be a mistake, so I called Dogwood to ask why the tip amount was changed. They said they would pull the receipt and email a scanned copy of it to me. Seven days later, that still has not happened.   Scott, emailed me to say \"I have not retrieved the signed copy of your credit card receipt.\" He goes on to say he will refund the amount or comp an appetizer or desert on our next visit. We weren't concerned with the amount, only that we had potentially been stolen from. When I pressed him to show the actual receipt, he did not respond (been a week so far and he did not respond to my email insisting he find and send me the receipt). He's crazy if he thinks he can drum up more business from us by comping an App or Desert after having our Tip changed.  If he would have sent us a copy of the receipt we could see if it was the restaurants mistake, in which case whoever changed our tip better be fired, or if it was our mistake, then this review would have been 4 or 5 stars.   So I will not recommend anyone go to Dogwood Southern table, or if you do, watch your card statement and match it to your copy of the receipt. I will not frequent a restaurant where someone steals tips when they did a bad job.",

    "text": "Had heard raving reviews of Dogwood both from fellow Yelpers as well as some Foodies I trust...may have hit them on a bad night.   The highlights included the service which was mostly spot on. Attentive but not overwhelming and generally knowledgeable. Did, however, have an overzealous wine pourer which always drives me crazy..don't want wine 3/4 up my glass so I'll order more- that really doesn't / shouldn't work, right? The winning order of the night was the Striped Bass special and it was special...perfectly cooked and well presented. The octopus and chorizo was very good as well however the yummy sausage may have covered up that the octopus was a bit over cooked.   A few very glaring low lights.. Soggy, watery mushroom \"pieces\" that had absolutely no taste..combined with some very random half- melted burrata cheese placement in the dish made this small plate muddled at best, inedible to most. The Collards (shame, shame...) were also underdone and lacked seasoning. Pretty inexcusable for a Southern themed restaurant.   Will give it another whirl on a weeknight (we went on a very busy Sat night) hoping it lives back up to the hype but they have some work to do.",

We started with the smoked trout with capers. Absolutely incredible! We also had the braised beef ribs with forbidden rice. I can't imagine anything better on the menu. I could eat it everyday. We also enjoyed the steak cut fries and cheesecake. By far the best cheesecake I've ever had. Such an amazing experience. The cappuccino was also perfect. Better than any coffee house.   The Childress blueberry desert wine was very sweet and very good. I hope anyone who lives in CLT takes advantage of this amazing dining experience!",

    "text": "Charlotte North Carolina, know as the \"Queen city\", after the late Queen Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Sterlitz, the wife of King George III of england.   The \"Hornet's Nest,\" rings True to the historical buzz of local residents who fired off enough ammunition to send the lobsterbacks sauntering away across the pond.   And even more infamously known as the \"Crown Town,\" for it's hiphop roots and relevant namesake the \"CLT.\"     A midwesterner commensing his business related travel to this magical place, my first thought was purely awe for the lush, vibrant trees surrounding this quaint coastal state... I can see why \"City of Trees,\" is even more fitting to address her majesty.    Flying in from Chicago I knew just by the fresh taste of the air I was somewhere captivating, historic and downright friendly!   Southern hospitallity is a catch phrase to many, but coming from the Chi-town I truley learned the meaning of hostpitallity and why the South is synonomous with this expression.  I step foot into Dogwood Southern Table & Bar and find myself in a quiet, romantic and... straight up classy joint. A very modern look on what many consider a traditional type of cuisine.  I was greeted by a friendly host who showed me to my table and presented an iPad with a list of creative cocktails brewed up by the very reputable barmaster who you will have to meet on your next visit here.  A gentleman who we shall call Deez pointed me in the direction of a signautre whiskey cocktail coined only as, Legends of the Fall. Ceylong Cinnamon bark smoked glass, fitted with a local distiller's earth shattering Rye Whiskey,  spiced simple syrup and house bitters topped with an orange peel that I could happily take in as my last bit of Vitamin C on this earth.  The first sip was heavenly and it only got better from there. Deez and another gentleman who stopped by my 1-top recommended the Duck Confeit and Dumplings for a hearty appetizer. Delicate and succulent Duck Leg was complimented by southern sytle dumplings which at first look I thought were scallops. The delicate texture and remarkable flavor quickly assured me they were infact dumplings, but those by the likes of which I had never embraced on virgin my palet. The waitress who brought the appetizer took the extra step to mention how persistent she is with tables to try this dish, and after just one bite I can 100% agree it's worth the imposition.  There was not a single thing on the menu which didn't look absolutely delectable, luckily the waiter made my decision easy by recommending the Scallops and Wild Boar. Wild Boar... the other other white meat. I think of pork and usually the excitement fizzles out faster than my best friends wedding night at the Palms resort in Vegas. But this was on another level. Rich, enchanting red meat cooked medium rare with the heartiness and remarkable flavor of a the tenderest of fillets, complimented by a texture which words cannot give justice. I just so happened to embrace the last drop of my Legends of the Fall rye cocktail when Deez brought me another famously made drink by the local bar master called a Ruff Rider. Teddy Rosevelt comes to mind with every sip, I could feel my mustache curling in excitement and even the thought of 4 bullet's to the chest couldn't phase me as I surrendered my taste buds to this simple yet perfect old fashioned, just as they didn't phase our 26th.   As I attempt my best efforts in summarizing a mindblowing experience at this masterpiece of Southern comfort, the Rubarb Tart Gelato materialized from what seemed to be thin air. Before I knew it I was on my last bite and speechless when asked how the desert tasted....It Truely made me feel some sorta way.  If I could go back to waiting tables, living in the restuarant scene or even just getting out more often..... I would want to relive this moment as many times as I could because even the lack of medical marijuana wasn't enough to damper  a record setting and magnificent first southern dining experience. Thank you Deez, Winter and Auggs (sorry for mixing up the names) you made a Chi-city foodie realize he hasn't yet begun to live.   Righteous!",

This continued to the point the hostess even said where we were was fine. Ultimately we left and went to Oak.",

The server came around and took our drink orders quickly. Someone asked and if they had Pappy Van Winkle and they actually did!!! The moment someone was interested in Pappy the server went and got the F&B manager to discuss the purchase, type and other options. They ended up having a bottle of 20 year Pappy and many other rate bourbons. My coworkers decided to order something else the F&B manager suggested and they really enjoyed it. The F&B manager literally sat down with the interested coworkers and had a detailed 10 minute conversation.   That service was definitely above and beyond.  The food was also excellent.  I liked the palmetto cheese spread appetizer the best but everything was wonderful and all at the dinner raved about the food, drinks and experience.",

I found this gem in the area and thought I would give it a shot.  I walk into Dogwood and the warm atmosphere felt like I was being tucked into bed and I was ready to cuddle up with this amazing menu.   Now my folks were in town so I needed something legend.....wait for it....dary. What better than the craft cocktail Legends of the Fall. The bartender took her blow torch from welding the bar together to spark some fire under some cinnamon infused bark. She instantly put my glass over it to get a nice smokey flavor and topped it off with some TLC. Highly recommend.  The food was out of this world but not really....everything they serve you is within the Carolinas. Everything is locally grown and fresher than MC Hammer. This was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time.",

    "text": "I'm definitely a fan of this place as it is a must do in Charlotte.  I will say it was a decent scene on the inside despite I was seated a little over in a corner.  There is a nice ambiance if you're in a larger group (2 or more) that feels a little high society like the rest of South Park, but not too stuffy as this place does have some southern charm to it (just not a whole lot of character that some more established restaurants in older neighborhoods offer).  All that being said, don't let the new South Park ambiance fool you because the food here can compete with any of the innovative and trendy places in Noda or Plaza Midwood (So can their prices).  I had the duck breast and Gnocchi dish, which right off the bat the fact that they had duck on the dinner menu was a good sign because many restaurants don't feature this or do it very well.   And they did it very well, it was delicious and beautifully prepared and the gnocchi was exquisitely complimentary.  Also had the the buffalo carpaccio which was good but probably a little pricey for what you actually get.  The drink menu is great and though I only had a cognac and bitters the menu seemed endless and the bartenders can even make you something out of thin air just by telling them the alcohol and flavor.  The dessert menu looked a little weak but i opted for the coke float and was not disappointed (hard to mess this up but they used Mexican Coke and some damn good vanilla ice cream so I was happy).  Note:  This place isn't cheap but I think its fair to say you get what you pay for on most dishes here given the circumstances and this is why Dogwood is a solid 4 star experience.  Food:  8.5/10 Ambiance: 6.5/10 Service:  9/10 Price:  $$$ (Not a bargain but also not a ripoff)  Will return.",

I was almost immediately served with a palate cleanser of goat cheese, fresh greens and a blueberry reduction on an apple slice, which was rather pleasant. The fried oyster appetizer, however was an unmitigated disaster. The breading was too thick (first strike), the poor oysters were overdone and tough (second strike) and it was obvious that they had been left too long in the fryer (punch out, called third strike). How is this even possible in the South? Lighten up on the breading and baby those morsels!   The entree more than made up for the appetizer, as the shrimp and grits were outstanding. Rich and creamy, you could actually TASTE everything -- from the Linney's Mill grits (from Union Grove), gulf shrimp and chorizo sausage (yum!) to the green onions, tomato, peppers (very nice) and okra, all the ingredients were in harmony. I could tell that a good deal of thought and a little love went into this dish. Well done!  No room for dessert, so I had to \"settle\" for a \"Kentucky Coffee\" of Makers Mark bourbon, a tasty Americano, rye whiskey, spiked cinnamon and whipped cream. That drink could become a habit with me. All in all, it was a delightful experience (even with the oysters) and I'll make it a point to come back.",

    "text": "This restaurant is part of the Dresslers Group (see my other reviews on their restaurants). I met my friend there on a weeknight and they tried to sit us along the banquette between 2 large parties and one of the parties had a baby. I don't think so. I asked to be moved to a quiet corner. We were then placed against the wall the farthest away from the hostess stand and could see the kitchen a little so it was much better. I ordered a cocktail called the 'pardon my french martini' for $13 (see pic). I give them an A+ for the taste and filling it to the tippy top of the glass. We both ordered french fries as sides and a main course each. However, the server brought out the french fries first so we started to eat them. Then the main course arrived 25 minutes later! (I know this exact timing because I took a phone picture of both as soon as they came to the table and can see the timestamp.) Why would Dogwood do this? Is that something you have to ask specifically that you want your side WITH your meal? Wouldn't you think that if you were ordering a side it would arrive when your main course arrives too? Is that too much to assume? Who has french fries as an appetizer? I had to ask the server where our main course was and if it was coming out of the kitchen soon. THAT IS NEVER GOOD to have a wait on a meal. Anyway, I got the pork chop and she go the fish special of the day (see pic). Both were good- with good food quality, but you definitely need to order and a la carte side because what is on the entree plate around the pork chop is really just a garnish and I didn't touch it.   Their website- I always look on a restaurant's website before the first time I ever visit so I am not fumbling around wasting time looking at the menu on the day and I can pay attention to the person I am with instead. I was confused by their website. At the top of the page, I clicked on 'menus'. Then on that page you see all these pictures of community suppers with pairings from local breweries. What is that about? Where is the regular menu? I am not part of your community and don't want to come to your supper.Well, if you look at the top of that page in tiny letters you see 'download current entrees' to see what they are serving on a nightly basis. Why wouldn't that be all over the page? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Definitely a head scratcher.   Overall, I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 due to the potentially bad seating situation, the a la carte side item fries not served with the meal, and difficult website navigation.",

It was good not great but good. The bread served with all the starters was phenomenal. For entree we had the lamb special and the grouper. The lamb was cooked perfectly.

The drink menu had something for everyone which was nice since we like to try new things. We ordered an appetizer, entree and dessert. The food was very good but I took one star away because my steak was overdone which is always a bummer. My boyfriend and I both ordered medium and his turned out perfect so I will say the food is great as long as they cook it right. One other thing is that the parking situation is great but they do have a valet option. Overall I would definitely visit again.",

We ended up in the bar because the dining room was full (7:30pm), which was not too bad but we were seated behind a stone column. I ordered the pork lion that came on a bed of cheese grits and greens.  The pork lion with the apple chutney was very good but the grits were cold.  Need to mentioned the pork lion was a bit on the salty side and grits were congealed.  My friend had the sirloin steak, which look like something from outback but he said it was good.  Will I go back..hmm. Not sure on a regular bases but if I do, I will be a little more attentive to the temperature and food quality.  Also, need to add another $ sign to the summary, it is a $$$ not a $$",

They just appear to be pretty understaffed whenever we eat here for lunch; we've had the same waiter a few times who is just not very friendly and does not treat us very well. He will not tell us anything about the specials and then a minute later he is at another table and tells them about the same specials in much greater detail. Also I have never had a waiter who did not come by later to ask how the food was once it came out. Unbelievable especially at a more upscale restaurant. It also took quite a while for the food to come out. My chicken pasta looked very unappetizing but everyone else in my group's food was very nice. If they had more and better service here this place would be great. I am glad they do not have gender neutral restrooms, I am not sure why yelp is even asking such a stupid question.",

I called ahead earlier and the host told us the seats available were at the Kitchen Bar, but assured us it's an experience. So we went for it, and he was right!  We pull up to the complimentary valet parking and they were very professional and friendly. Went inside and the place was electric. Packed with people, but in a good way.  We were taken to our seats which were right by the appetizer prep station.  The Restaurant Week menu had 3 apps, 3 entrees, and 3 deserts to choose from for your meal for $40. We ordered the Roasted Muscles and Tomatoes & Goat Cheese to start. My first time trying muscles and they were amazing.  The goat cheese was also incredible! The coolest thing was watching them be prepared right in front of us and talking with the chef.  For the entrees, I had the Pork Loin and my GF had the Grouper.  Both were awesome. We finished up with a slice of the Toasted Pound Cake which was a perfect cap to the meal, or so we thought.  Our server, who was stellar all night, hooked us up with a slice of cheesecake on the house! Fantastic!  Our server was super friendly and helpful throughout the night. I had to run out to make a phone call and he kept my gf company for a couple minutes.  The guys behind the Kitchen Bar were great to talk to and would hand us samples of the different appetizers throughout the meal. We got to try the Succotash and the Pan Fried Sweet Potatoes, as well as some cured pork they had on display.  Highly recommend the sweet potatoes!  Great meal, amazing service, can't wait to go back. Definitely top 5 meals of my life.",

The boiled peanuts with Kosher salt were awesome.  The baked pimento cheese app was killer. Bottled wine well priced and nicely curated.  Pound cake dessert you Yelpers raved about lived up to its expectations. The best:  Brain, a manager, gladly answered my question about the Hendrick's infused blackberry gin.

We arrived early for our 6pm reservation on a Saturday night and we were able to sit in the bar right near the cozy fireplace.  Our waitress, Monique, came over right away with the IPad with the drink menu.  She gave us great suggestions and we ordered a Dark and Stormy and a Blackberry Collins.   My husband said the Dark and Stormy was the best he ever had.  We also ordered the Chips and Dip while we looked over the menu.  They came out quickly and were amazing!  So addictive.   We then ordered the Dogwood Oysters, Fontina Cheese, Ceviche, Littleneck clams and the Grouper.  They all came out a bit staggered which was great and they all tasted amazing.  Each one was perfectly cooked and were so delicious.    The manager came over and was very friendly and down to earth.  You can tell that they put a lot of work and heart into this place.  I can't say enough about our waitress, Monique.  She rocked.  I am counting down the days until we can go back.",

Followed by delicious grouper, scallops and rib eye. The only miss was the flounder which was under-cooked. Great wine selection too, discounted 20% off, although prices seemed a little high.  We will definitely be back. It's a great addition to SP area.",

    "text": "This has been a consistent favorite of mine since it opened. The food and service is outstanding, but I like the bar and drinks the best. Brian, the head bartender, is the best in the business. Order a \"barkeep's call,\" tell him what liquor you like, and let him create something unique and great for you. If they are not busy, he will chat away with you while you drink, and he's an interesting and funny guy. Another perk of sitting at the bar is that, at certain times, they will serve you the best cheeseburger in Charlotte, at a dramatically low price, during happy hour. Regular menu is great. In particular, the charcuterie plate is solid, and the duck entree is strong. I would give the shrimp and grits a miss, however, it's bland and too saucy. Overall, I've eaten and been drinking here dozens of time and never been disappointed. Best example of Southern farm to table in town.",

I got the lunch one thinking I could go in a Saturday but they are only opened for dinner that day so I opted to go on a Sunday. I sat at the bar and informed the bartender that I had a Groupon for lunch and she give me the menu. I ordered enough to cover the $25 Groupon. Starting with the fried oysters which could have been seasoned better but eating them with both the slaw & sauce they were good. Then I got the duck fingers and scallops, the overall dish was good but the duck fingers were very bland. The scallops on the other hand were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I gave 2 stars do the the blandness of some of the food and for the fact that once the check come the bartender then tells me that I can't use my Groupon but it's brunch not lunch, when she could have told me that from the beginning and when I asked for the manager he acted too busy so I just paid my tab and left but I don't have a desire to go back after that.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a large mixed community in the South Park area of Charlotte, to Dogwood Southern Table & Bar. This contemporary eating establishment offers \"elevated southern cuisine\" using in-house creations from local and sustainable sources.  Dora here. Because it was Father's Day and we didn't make reservations, our only seating options were the patio or the bar. Glorious day, beautiful patio, no brainer.    For an appetizer, we chose the Maw Maw's Biscuits served with butter and jam. The biscuits were great, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Adding the butter and jam made for an outstanding bite. Dora here. When I lifted the linen and saw the charred tops on these biscuits, I considered asking for another basket, but hubby usually orders everything extra crispy, so he was thrilled. No worries! Even with the toasted tops, these biscuits were great. Buttery flavor, crumbly, and had to eat with a fork. Good to the last fork!  For my meal, I chose the Steak and Eggs. Normally, it's sirloin, but this day it was prime rib, green beans, potatoes, and spinach served with an easy-over egg on top. The prime rib was cooked a perfect medium rare, tender and juicy. The crispy potatoes and veggies paired well with the dish. I am not one who usually orders steak out, but I would definitely order this dish again.  Dora here. Whenever a place serves only brunch on the weekend, I'm usually ready for a dilemma. Give me my cereal or an English Muffin with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast and I'm good. When I go out for lunch, I want lunch, so I opted for the Breakfast Burger today. I appreciated all the individual components: scrambled egg, cheddar, bacon jam, incredibly soft bun. But together? Not so much. And it turns out I'm not a fan of grass-fed beef. Something about the flavor just messed with my taste buds. Who'd have guessed? Hubby liked it.  What's your favorite brunch dish/place? We'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2tbY8bB&s=376f352875e062be6e1295ab4227f3ad5431734ca827df8479d86cb3248a9fac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2tbY8bB</a>",

The worst is when you enjoy the food, but the service is lacking. Well, at Dogwood you do not not have to search any further or any farther.  Our server Adi was attentive, kind, funny with great recommendations.   The pimento cheese, (I know) was supringsly delish. I would have NEVER ordered it, had he not recommended it.  For entrees I got the scallops and boar, my husband had the flank and duck. Both were good, he also recommended the grouper... We didn't get it. Next time we'll get that and shrimp and grits.... Though, I'm not sure if they rotate the menu items.  Dessert wise, know that this is a Dressler restaurant, so the desserts are similar at them all. Here, we had the pound cake, which was okay. Next time we'll get the cheesecake.",

We were both starving, having only having a small snack for breakfast and fasted for the rest of the day.  Our waiter was very helpful with ordering, as he made several recommendations that we took him up on that were quite wonderful: Octopus Chorizo, BBQ spare ribs, duck breast with gnocchi, and wild boar with scallops.   The spare ribs are very tender, as the meat falls off the bone with a touch of the fork and are well sauced and delicious. The octopus is like a meaty soup with a little heat that was quite nice.  I had the duck, and it was fantastic. Fat rendered just right and the gnocchi was some of the best I have had. I had a taste of the boar and it was quite good too.  The hard part was dessert. Normally there are 2 or 3 items that really stand out for us, but here we wanted to have everything, lol. So ended up getting a carrot cake and a peanut butter chocolate cheesecake. All the items are made by the owners mother, and you can taste it. Super good!  Would definitely come back to try more of their dishes for sure.",

    "text": "I can't stop speaking The Dogwood's praises after stopping in for dinner last week. The owners, Tim and Scott, are so pleasant and welcoming, and really provided great knowledge and information about the mission and culture of The Dogwood.   While they describe themselves as a \"modern Southern kitchen,\" I would also add that they have culminated a local, rustic atmosphere, similar to a modern barn. They have beautiful brick columns and a wooden stable, where you can feel like you're enjoying the farm to fork cuisine in a modern day barn.   The Dogwood offers 80 different bourbons, making them the largest collector of bourbon in Charlotte. The menu offers a variety of bourbon flights. Speaking of spirits, they also offer a variety of craft cocktails, and on Wednesdays, they do a cocktail night where you can taste the bartender's new concoction of the week for only $5.00!! And, they do $5.00 burgers and $1.00 oysters M-F during happy hour!  To start, you should order the bacon jam, a simple yet complex dish. The bacon jam is made with only 5 ingredients, including coffee grinds, and gives you that hint of sweet and savory simultaneously. It's served with country bread to soak up it's goodness.   If you're into tartars, the bison tartar was fabulous. The house mustard gave it an entirely different complexity, and helped balance some of the saltiness. It's served with a quail egg on top that provides more savory flavors to soak up the rest.   I can never pass up scallops, so we went with the scallop dish for our main meal. The combination of flavors would have been good on their own without the scallops! Served over butternut, kale, fingerling potatoes with an oxtail marmalade, this dish was heaven!!  For dessert, please and I repeat, please do not miss out on Mom's Cheesecake, which is a secret recipe from Mrs. Dressler, made in her own kitchen! It is the best cheesecake you'll ever have the pleasure of biting into. You know how you can order cheesecakes and sometimes they're a little bit frozen in the middle, or they are too lumpy? Not this one. The consistency is impeccable and your fork goes straight through. It's smooth, creamy and rich, with a perfect graham crust.   They also do seasonal sorbet's and gelato, made in house. We tried the tahini gelato, which was definitely different and not something I'd typically order. It wasn't overly tahini flavored, which surprised me. It was good, but I much preferred the strawberry rhubarb sorbet, which was refreshing, fruity, and the perfect combination of tart and sweet. I'd eat that any day of the week!  Until next time, Dogwood..",

For me, the dining experience doesn't blow my mind in any one aspect, it simply does southern/american cuisine very well.  The happy hour food special they run during the week ($5 lamb burgers/$1 oysters) is out of this world.  You can't find a better burger for $5, and even if I remove the price, it's still one of my favorite burgers at any price point.  It's only available in the bar area, but it's a great way to have a mid-week meal paired with an excellent selection of drinks.",

    "text": "A truly outstanding find! A bit pricey but wow what flavors!  I was headed with our group to another location but it ended up having such a long wait that we deviated to this one.  It was way dark inside... so dark that you have to use your phone to read the menu. The place was in a nice area, with several other selections, and you could tell it was on the higher side, but the group decided to stay.  First the cocktails selections... really interesting inspired drinks like no where I have been. Smoked cinnamon bark whisky, raspberry infused bourbon with blueberries, and a whisky vanilla old fashion just to name some of them. I had a great vanilla porter beer but the group raved about the specialty cocktails.  I was so full from my other meal of the day that I only ordered a starter as my main dish... chorizo octopus. Yes that's right... read it again... chorizo octopus. It was wonderful! The most tender octopus with a great chorizo spice and for a starter it was enough for a meal. I am used to octopus being a bit chewy but this was a kin to a fine filet! Melted like warm butter in my mouth! The combination was surprisingly amazing!  The group that I was with all raved about their food as well and I got to try the blanched and then flash fried sweet potato chips infused with watermelon glaze... WOW! Fantastic! A very flavorful selection!  Our service was outstanding and the place was a vision of decor.     Desert was no exception... any of you that have been to Dreslers near Morresville NC know that Mamas cheese cake or mamas carrot cake is not something to be passed up. Well it turns out that Dogwood is a member of the family and momma makes their cheese cake and carrot cake too! We had both and all agreed they were the best anyone had ever had.  The larger down fall of this location was the price... a meal for 4 cost almost as much as a higher end car payment and really reminded me why I like to eat at home... however today I still find myself thinking about that chorizo and octopus!  I suggest this location for flavor profiles you will not normally find in food and drink",

This restaurant is very consistent from the dishes that stay on the menu right down to the drinks and desserts. Not the cheapest option, but way more value than some of the popular chain steakhouses. The wild boar is so much better than a filet, highly recommended the crab hush puppies and baked pimento cheese appetizer. The duck breast is another winner and almost as good as Roosters. The cocktails are fairly unique and made to perfection.",

They were able to push our reservation back day of and our server Samantha was very attentive and funny.   The food was superb. My husband really enjoyed the North Carolina Oysters and his Kansas City bone in Strip.  The portion was massive but it was cooked perfectly and he managed to eat every last bite. I had the chicken and it was really well cooked as well.  The menu changes a ton because they use locally sourced ingredients.  We also really enjoyed the pan fried sweet potatoes.  I hope they keep it ok the menu.   Next time I come to Charlotte I'd like to come back.",

    "text": "Dogwood is owned by the same people as Dressler's. The idea behind this restaurant is \"Elevated Southern Food\". My dinner group met here to celebrate the group's 6th anniversary.  First off, the decor is beautiful with reclaimed wood, a couple of fireplaces and wood beams. Tables in the dining room seemed to be right on top of each other. And the place was LOUD with nothing to eat the noise so you could barely hear the person across the table from you.  The drink menu is provided on an iPad for your viewing. They seem to have an extensive wine and whiskey list. The beer list consists of local and regional beers. I started the non-alcoholic thing recently and they have a few non-alcoholic drinks including a house made ginger beer which is what I ordered. It was spicy but delicious and not too sweet.  Almost everyone at our table ordered some sort of appetizer or salad. I ordered their market salad which was described as greens with a mixture of root vegetables and a spicy dressing. The problem here is that half our table (we had 11 people) received their appetizers and then the rest of the table waited approximately 15 minutes for theirs. The salad was good but the pieces of root vegetables were tiny.  For an entree, I ordered the Trout. Around the table, shrimp and grits and the Ribeye were popular. The trout was good with a nice skin and presented on a bed of rice grits but the grits lacked flavor. I was able to sample my neighbors ribeye and that was delicious with great flavor and very tender.  Most of us ordered dessert. The carrot cake was really good. I ordered the NY cheesecake and while it was good and creamy I thought it could have been a bit more on the firm side.  For service, our server was amazing. She kept up with everything.  The noise level is what killed this experience for me and the appetizer timing issue. But the food has some highs and lows and you never know until you try a place out.",

On our past visit, I met some girlfriends and we decided to eat at the chef's table and watch them prepare the food. Such an awesome experience...id recommend it to anyone!   We started with a sampling of the pork belly and it was heavenly. Next up, we got to sample some bacon jam which if you haven't tried and you're a bacon lover (like me) you NEED to try it. It was so good! Every single bite got better and better.   For our meals we ordered the short rib, macaroni and cheese, pork ribs and fries.   Don't judge us!   I'd absolutely order every single dish again. The short ribs were tender and juicy the macaroni was cheesy goodness and the fries are hand cut and served up hot with both ketchup and aioli. Can you say winning?   If you haven't tried this place, definitely check them out. The menu is pretty awesome and they have different specials each week!   *Oh, they just added beignets to the brunch menu!  You're welcome!",

The space is attractive and homey without falling into 'country kitch'. Our server, Rebecca, was pleasant and knowledgeable. We started with a Wagyu beef appetizer which was very good, then moved on to duck (DELICIOUS!!) and wild boar chops (YUM!) A great bottle of red, suggested by Rebecca, took this stellar meal to the next level. We even had dessert, a rarity for us, cheesecake and toasted pound cake - both divine. We will certainly go back the next time we are in town!",

This place is far from that, it's more upscale than the name and the dining space. My husband and I have dined here about four or five times now. Twice with friends we introduced to this place and other times on DATENIGHT and on our anniversary. The service is stellar and the menu is pretty simple and broken down very clearly. The staff is knowledgeable and very personable from our many experiences. Our favorite items from the menu includes the fried oyster appetizer, any fish that is on the chefs special feature for the evening, the salads are all tasty and our favorite dessert is the grilled pound cake with vanilla ice cream.  The oysters are fries to perfection the only issue we have with them is THE PORTION is TOOOO SMALL.  This place is great for DateNight, lunch with friends, a group outing or just because. Some of the portion sizes could increase for the appetizers but hey they are appetizers not the main course :-)",

I forgot it was restaurant week so the wait would have been over an hour but there were two seats available back near the open kitchen. I think there were 6 seats total. We took those and settled in for a delicious night.  The cocktail list is fairly impressive with lots of classics and bold flavor. They also offer a bunch of bourbons by the glass; nearly 40! They offer some Scotch too. There is a nice selection of wine and I beer, if that's more your thing. I ordered a Sazerac.  The food we ate on was the chips, roasted oysters, pork belly with gnocchi and the house made sausage plate. Everything was so wonderfully prepared and the chefs in the kitchen were telling us about the food as they made it and where it came from. The meat plate was a nice surprise. There were about 8 different types of house cured meat and it came with pickles and whole grain mustard. So flavorful! The entire staff was impressive and the taste of homemade limoncello that was given to us didn't hurt either.  I'll be bringing my husband there for a bourbon night soon.",

What we ate: Crab Hushpuppies - Let's just say this hushpuppy makeover was the best I have tasted, a great balance of flavors and you could actually see the crab!  Carolina Dumplings - I went out on the limb to try these since normally I don't like dumplings but these were pretty amazing, the granny smith apples with the ham is a surprisingly pleasant combination  Bacon Jam -- it's bacon used as a main ingredient in a mouth-watering jam, don't think I need to say this but AMAZING.  Sauteed Mahi Mahi -- perferctly cooking and not your usual grilled mahi mahi, and it came with okra! it was my hubby's dish but I could have easily eaten it all  Hanger Steak with spaghetti squash --- best combination ever, I was so happy that they serve steak without the potatoes!   Mac N Cheese -- This is was perfectly cooking, pasta was al dente which I have never seen happen in baked mac n cheese.  It was a bit rich and I enjoyed my entree so much that I couldn't enjoy this as much as I ususally would.  Succotash -- Ok, I never thought I would order this but the server said it was favorite so we got it and he was right.  It was buttery veggie goodness.  Mom's Cheesecake -- this is an NY Style cheesecake made by the owner's mom, it was the best cheesecake I ever had and beat any of the ones I ever had in NYC by a million points.  It was so good that I got a slice to go.",

I was about to take out a mission persons report). They have an iPad for the drink menu, but a regular food menu. Odd, but okay.  We put together a few small plates/snacks to share - pimento cheese (our deeelicious favorite), bacon jam (good, but really just chopped up bacon; Tapas 51's is better), house chips (tasty), and crab pups (fine but small). Then we split the pumpkin pecan cheesecake for dessert, and with three people, we each got about three bites - perfect.  Every place deserves a second chance!",

We ended up coming here to eat small plates and booze, while being disappointed in the stale NCAA basketball tournament.   This place is a spinoff of Dressler's (in the Metropolitan), so a lot of the menu items are similar, especially the drink menu, which was a bit disappointing, because we hoped to try something new.  The ribs and pimento cheese plates were good, but the bacon jam with bread was great. The only downside was the jar of bacon jam was small. Gimme more jam, dogwood's....  Hopefully we'll head here for some entrees, but who knows. This place is a solid backup spot, if another restaurant in South Park that you planned to go to is too packed.",

We ate and drank at the bar where we received superb service each time!  The food and cocktails were amazing and the staff working behind the bar are all True professionals.  Each one highly skilled, and extremely friendly.  My husband and I were both blown away especially by Brian and Jo Ann's hospitality.  They each share a passion for their craft, and both have a wonderful way of making their customers feel very special!  I cannot wait to visit Charlotte again, so we can head back to Dogwood Southern Table & Bar.  BTW-Brian was voted best bartender in Charlotte!",

Our server JT was above and beyond attentive and helpful.  I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict as suggested. It was amazing and quite filling. I would highly recommend putting this on your must try list. I also could not resist trying the French toast. I really enjoyed slightly crunchy batter. It's a huge portion and sinfully delicious. The coffee is french press and enough for two cups. I would suggested going earlier because the noise gets a little loud when they start to fill up. It's a very inviting atmosphere and they have a neat bar area that faces the kitchen. I can't wait to come back and try their dinner menu. JT also informed us that they have really cool events that feature different chefs and drinks.",

Well, everyone loved the food and experience. I had our server choose the appetizers and none were left uneaten. The pimento cheese spread and bacon jam were by far the favorites but no one complained about his other choices.  If there's anything to complain about, and it's hard to find anything, it'd be the noise level. As the place filled up it was hard to hear across our own table.  Lastly, if you're going to complain about price just don't come here. You get what you pay for and here it's great food, great service, and a loud but friendly ambience.",

The first appetizer was the special, pork belly. Toys one is the only reason I don't give these folks 5 stars. It was two small pieces of pork belly, which were left too chewy for my tastes, but was the most expensive dish we had.   Everything else was outstanding. We had the arugala salad and the market salad, both of which were very fresh, with an excellent combination of flavors.  The real star was dish was the dock and dumplings. The flavor was fantastic, with the duck being very moist while still having a nice crisp skin. The gravy had a fantastic flavour as well.  My wife ordered a lemon drop martini and it tasted like fresh lemonade with a kick. Delicious!  To top it all off, our service was excellent with multiple wait staff making excellent recommendations and keeping check on us without hovering.   We will definitely stop in again the next time we're I town!",

They're trying to brand themselves as a farm-to-table restaurant but it didn't quite feel that way.   I swung through with some friends for dinner on a casual Tuesday evening - we jumped straight into cocktails and appetizers. I ordered the 'Legends of the Fall' and was mildly disappointed to taste a copy cat of an old fashioned. The chick n dumplings; however, was a thoughtful and well done appetizer - the dumplings just melted in your mouth.    For the main course I had the beef ribs which were tasty and my friend ordered the special of the day: scallops and duck. This wouldn't be my first choice of items to combine and when I had a bite from his plate my assumptions were confirmed - his entree wasn't nearly as good as my beef ribs.",

So in short let me save you 200 dollars and go somewhere else.   From beginning to end it was just mediocre. Had octopus and chorizo which was ok but does not mix well to me. The broth was decent and flavorful. The raw oysters were good but the dogwood ones with chorizo were eh. Had the scallops and wild boar. Let me tell for 40 bucks you get 4 bites of salty off tasting pork. The scallops with the sauce were cooked right and good. The vegetables with the dish were also good. The espresso martini was also a miss as it was more watery then others I've had and not creamy. Even my buddy said his entree of trout was no good. Guess you are paying for the surrounding atmosphere. Skipped dessert as just had a high probability of being unexciting as the whole meal was.",

Today they were trying hard to sell my friend, Dan, and me their pimento cheese appetizer. The problem (for me) is that it included bacon. I am not a pork or beef eater, so NO to bacon!  I had a chicken sandwich that came with fries.  Oh yes, the sandwich came with bacon, which I asked them to hold. It also had a lot of garlic, which made it not quite as good for me.   I loved the tables and the space. I observed that they can accommodate larger groups of people, which is a good thing.  The music and acoustics were not conducive to good conversation, until after the lunch hour settled down.   I liked discovering this spot and so glad that we went. Next time, I will see if they can do some bacon-free pimento cheese. And I will go well after the lunch crowd has come and gone.",

The pimento cheese and charcuterie are my favorites though. I had the wild boar and scallops last time and I have never had such delicious and tender scallops before! I could have eaten a whole steak of the wild boar. It was simply amazing. We had great service from both our waiter and the manager. Always have to finish a meal here with the carrot cake or toasted pound cake. We bring our own wine and pay the corkage fee (I think $10/bottle) since wine can quickly put your bill over the top. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down. Be prepared for a leisurely paced meal. We typically spend about two hours here, but usually come with friends so it makes for a fun night out. Atmosphere is a little loud for my liking, but food and service are 100% worth putting up with a little noise.",

The service was nothing short of amazing; however, I was a little disappointed in the food. I come from a southern family but I felt like their southern food was a little over \"southernized.\" Everything was super heavy and most of my meal came with us in a To Go box. I left feeling like I needed a Pepto Bismol. It was just too heavy and perhaps overly trendy southern for me. I did feel like they really aimed to please though. They graciously brought me a different champagne when the first one I ordered was too sweet for me. Next time I'll probably stick to small plates. I ordered the short rib at the server's recommendation and I just didn't like it. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and loved it. We started with the pimento cheese which normally I love but I didn't care for theirs. I'm probably the only person who is not a huge fan of this restaurant.",

Our Waitress was great..she was right there the whole time, making sure we had clean plates and utensils...Very informative about the menu too! We started out with the Beignets. They were very good...the espresso sauce not so much. We arrived before 12 on Sunday so we had to wait for the Bloody Marys which are served with a beer back! Which is such a great  Midwestern thing..I was not surprised to hear that the owners were from Minnesota.. ( My Old State). I ordered the Crab Benedict... I hesitate every where except Charleston in Ordering Crab Cakes...Why oh Why can they not be More Crab..less filling?? They sat on a round of a whole wheat bread and I could barely taste the Crab from the bread...thats a No go for me again. Presentation for all the dishes was beautiful, I tried the Walnut French toast..it was presented like Bon Appetit but alas did not taste so good..very dry. The Pimento Cheese gratin was delicious. We did get the bloody mary..nice rim on glass and the beer back was good. The Chicken and Waffle sandwich was liked by my friend and the omelet next to me was dry. I would try it again for dinner..it has possibilites...the over all ambience is nice, just needs to tweak the entrees again....",

I was one of their first customers when they opened and spoke to the manager about how loud it was in there, that you couldn't hear your dinner partner. Was told they were working on the acoustics to help absorb the sound without compromising the decor (huh? - Nothing to write home about in that respect!). The food was not outrageously priced then although I wasn't thrilled with the mediocre glass of a carefully measured white wine that on a later visit was priced at THIRTEEN DOLLARS (I did say mediocre & ordered it without looking at wine menu pricing). I haven't tried Rusty Bucket yet but would be willing to give it a shot when it warms up and can sit outside. Cork Buzz looks very nice - I wish they had a more \"normal\" dinner menu. It's too contrived!",

Crab cakes, shrimp with chimichurri and fried oysters all great. Nice local beers and top of the line bourbon. We went with shots of Jim Beam room temperature!

The oysters were fresh and served with all the typical accoutrements and the salad was delicious.  I sampled a few dishes from my dining companions' plate and everything was delicious!  Great selection of beer on tap.  I didn't look too hard at the wine list but it seemed extensive and yes they have a full bar!  I was just in a beer drinking mood . The mark ups on the beer were a bit steep for what I have seen in Charlotte but I guess you are paying for the ambience? (Or that South Park rent, as it's near the mall in one of those shopping/ dining centers... I still have to get use to all the strip malls here in Charlotte) I will certainly be back as I don't mind paying a pretty penny for a decent meal and excellent service!",

    "text": "Tasty!!! I was excited to try Dogwood - I've always been a fan of farm to table establishments - reading reviews on Yelp allowed me to scope out a few \"must haves\" before I even got there. Was another couple with my husband and I - we started with the oysters, bacon jam and southern dumplings... (Dumplings were awesome)! The others were good too... But those dumplings..... I ordered the scallops and hubby got the shrimp and grits - we cleaned our plates! Grits were almost sweet, which was strange, but not bad - dessert was a little disappointing as I was expecting something \"southern\" (I guess pound cake is southern)? But I saw one evening there was banana pudding and if hoped for something like that instead of carrot cake - or chocolate creme brulee.  Regardless, we will absolutely be back. Sunday dinners just got a whole lot more exciting.",

    "text": "This place was unbelievable from start to finish! We walked in and it was restaurant week.. unbeknownst to us. I was visiting my hometown from San Diego last minute. (For a funeral) The manager did his absolute best to get us settled in the bar area. It was my Moms 72nd bday and it was an impromptu outing. She doesn't like sitting at the bar, but here it was different. We saddled up and immediately felt at home. Clean bar with warm welcoming faces smiling at us. The crafting of the cocktails was something to behold. Muddling, slicing, burning cedar chips, preparing fruits and garnishes, etc. Impeccable. We decided to eat at the bar as well. We ordered shrimp and grits, crab and chorizo hush puppies, fried oysters, golden beets and baked sweet potatoes.    E V E R Y bite was unreal. Best shrimp and grits I've ever had and I'm southern as can be. They ended up giving us complimentary drinks in honor of my Mom and a delicious chocolate desert to boot. Usually sitting at the bar you get dodgy service and not so great attention to detail. I have travelled the world and dined out a LOT and they know what they are doing here. Amazing customer service and attention to detail. Thank you guys for making my Mom's Birthday night so special, one that we will never forget. And thank you for accommodating us on such a hectic night and making us feel like valued clientele. Needless to say, we will be back and you should go now! You'll feel like part of the family. Cheers!",

Their lunch menu is super simple and packed full of delicious choices.  I had the cat fish po boy and my husband had their pork sandwich.  We both cleaned our plate.  The win however goes to my dad, he ordered the NC trout and we were all envious.  It was so good, he even closed his eyes while he was chewing it :) Dessert was great, they told us that Grandma Dressler comes in every morning and makes the carrot cake and cheesecake from scratch.   I can't wait to check out the dinner menu!",

Our waiter, Rob, was very informative, helpful and very attentive, yet allowed us to dine without interruption. His knowledge of the food selections served our decision making well as the menu is extensive, without being over the top. My husband had the muscles, unbelievably generous portion, seasoned to perfection! He followed them with the bourbon rib appetizer that was to die for! I enjoyed the house made potatoe chips sharing them, as they, also, were a generous portion. Followed up with the shrimp & grits that were delightful and filling! Leftovers for sure!  Skipped dessert this vist, will try something next time. Will definitely  make this a frequent spot to enjoy and plan on bringing friends with us very soon!",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times, and each visit leading up to my most recent was fine, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars. My most recent visit just left a poor taste in my mouth, and since I've been stewing over it for a few days, I decided I would share.   We visited at dinner time to celebrate a birthday. We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation time and told the hosts' table that the other two people in our party grabbed a drink at the bar while they waited for us to arrive. An older gentleman responded that the other two in our party had a table in the bar area and we could just sit there or he'd try to see if he could find something in the dining room. We had a reservation for a table in the dining room to celebrate a birthday, so I'm not sure why he was trying to see if he could find anything! After greeting the rest of our party, my husband went back to the hosts' table to tell them that we are not eating at the bar. Fast forward about 5-10 minutes and my husband is nowhere to be found. We walk out into the dining room, and he is sitting alone at a table in the very back corner. When I asked why he was sitting there alone, he told us that the same gentleman who said he would 'try to find us a table' would grab us from the bar and escort us to our table. That never happened.   Our waiter was okay but it wasn't the type of service you'd expect with a $250 bill- he took my husband's drink order but walked away before I could order one for myself. He was helpful with the menu selections. Unfortunately, my $44 medium-rare steak was incredibly hard to eat. It was so tough and filled with strings of fat that were impossible to chew through - I took 2/3 of the steak home so I could chew in peace. The kitchen also apparently served two dishes incorrectly to our table, for which they corrected by offering two free desserts to those individuals. I thought this was a nice gesture, but our waiter only brought out two dessert menus and never asked the other two people at the table if they were interested in dessert. We rarely order dessert at a restaurant, but it was quite obvious that we were celebrating a birthday, so I was irritated by lack of concern.   Overall, I'm pretty disappointed by most recent visit because I've had much better experiences there. I'm sure we'll eventually go back again, but it certainly won't be my first choice.",

Dropping in for a recent anniversary dinner, my wife and I enjoyed fabulous service, an outstanding bottle of wine and one of the best meals we've had in a long time. My entree of Wild Boar and Scallops was fabulously succulent, and my wife's plate of Shrimp and Grits was bursting with flavor. We capped it all off with an amazing slice of chocolate cake that was almost too rich to finish.  Dogwood impressed us even more on my return visit - it truly is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte, and a fabulous setting to celebrate any special occasion.",

The servers are always friendly and helpful. It does get busy but I'm usually not in a hurry in these kinds of places so I don't mind if they can't stop by every five minutes. The food comes out at different times because of the nature of the restaurant (mostly small plates), which is fine by me as well. The drinks are excellent, and though pricey, not more than you pay elsewhere for good cocktails made with quality ingredients. The Old Fashioned is my favorite, and I've had it at many different places. This is one of the best, and consistently good.  I go back whenever I get the chance!",

As the night went on she became busy with other tables which was ok due to the restaurant becoming busy. Her service was exceptional other then the slight delay once busy.   Our food was my issue. Our apps were good with our selection of the risotto balls and pimento cheese. The risottos balls took awhile to come out but the pimento cheese came out quickly!   My problem was the wait for our entree's. We waited at least 30 minutes or more between our apps and our entrees. That's when our server became busy and we received no service.   Once we received our entrees they were very underwhelming. The least exciting part of our evening. Have you ever been to a place that does not put salt on the table because they believe their food is \"above salt on the table\"? Well this is one of those restaurants BUT they did not delivery in flavor on the entrees. Both my shrimp and grits and his pork shank needed a pinch of salt.   I would not go back due to entrees. Sometimes going to a restaurant and paying over $100 for a dinner for two is less impressive then going to dive and paying $60 for two and being blown away.",

Yesterday went to a restaurant that I have been bugging my friend to go to--very disappointed. Today we find Dogwood Southern Table Bar by accident, and what a find. You want a great meal experience, locally sourced food, great service, then you need to get to this restaurant.  I had the chicken and biscuits with Chorizo gravy, and. Y girlfriend had the crepes.  The chicken, nice crust and flavor, the chorizo gravy was phenomenal.  The crepes, had chicken Shitake mushrooms, asparagus with spinach and a great house jus, made with a veal stock.  You need to ask for Michael, knows food and great service.   We'll be back for dinner, and did I mention the great value-delicious food at a wonderful price!

Dogwood however has met the mark! Our server Allison was amazing. She made my birth-month celebration memorable with her quick service and GREAT sense of humor.  I started out with a Caribbean OF which was too strong for my light weight self and voila! Came came back with a tiki'd version of what I previously had with a birthday greeting attached.  I had the NC chicken breast dish that is not your average bland chicken.  It was moist and delish in a sauce, served with black rice and squash. My friend had the scallops with boar. The boar was well seasoned and like a lean filet. We both cleaned our plates.  For dessert we had a delicious roasted pound cake with ice cream and caramel sauce. It was a moist buttery treat.   Will definitely return as Dogwood makes my top five Charlotte dining establishments.",

The hostess was willing to wait way beyond our 6:30 reservation because no one in my group seem to understand to be there on time even tho I have reminded them 3x.  I arrived at 6:20pm and decided to sit at the bar. It wasn't busy for a Friday night.. It took a min for the bartender to notice me. I ordered the Forktale Rose Sparkling. It was good and to my satisfaction to the tastebud. When half for the group arrive, they also sat at the bar.. they had to wait for bit (longer than I have) before the bartender to take notice of them! I can hear the friends mumbling how they're not happy about that since it's Friday and they sure need a drink from a long day of work! Finally we're seated by 7pm.   Customer service: 3/5 could've been more attentive. I have 3 waiters but water wasn't efficiently filled. We ordered pop over or bread 2x. It didn't come til mid way thru the meal.. That's when I had to ask for the 3rd time!   Food: 4/5 I ordered the duck leg/chicken leg with grilled veggies and sweet potato puree. Duck was on the salty side but it has the perfect crisp to it. The puree was heavenly. Wish there were more. The staff brought me a cheesecake for my birthday. I shared it. But the bit I had was yum!   Ambience: 5/5 perfect night. Not too loud and too busy. All the tables was spaced nicely.. usually places would pack tables in where I can hear the next table over. But not here. Decor was perfect.   I would love to go here again. I would think this is a good place to take that special date. He or she would've been impress!",

    "text": "I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this place to myself, it is THAT good. I have been here numerous times and every time, they are on point with the service, drinks, food, and ambiance. I have tried most of the menu and you just can't go wrong.   Since moving from my hometown of Charleston, SC, I have found the Charlotte food scene lackluster in comparison. But Dogwood Southern Table just reminds me of home. They change their menu seasonally, which I love. But also have delicious staples like the shrimp and grits (which are as close to the Lowcountry recipe as I have found in Charlotte).   I don't drink cocktails often, but when I dine here, I do. I love that I can just tell my server that I want a vodka based drink that isn't too sweet and they just make me a delicious cocktail. I have never had the same drink twice. And they pin a recipe card to the glass so you know what is in it and can order it again. I don't do this anywhere but here.   The servers are attentive and polite but what is most important is that they KNOW the menu. It is like they actually, oh I don't know, sample the dishes so they can speak from experience and not from what it looks like or what someone has told them.   I take all my clients here for lunch or dinner and this place always makes me look like a rock star.",

    "text": "My wife and I had lunch here for the first time and found that, yes, it did indeed live up to its excellent Yelp reviews. We each had a beet and goat cheese salad that was fresh (except for a few candied pecans), delicious and substantial. Even at $10, it wasn't a bad value. We then split a grilled chicken sandwich with house fries that ran $13 and easily left us both satisfied. OVERPRICED BEVERAGE  ALERT applies as fountain drinks run $2.50. This, as my readers know too well, is a major pet peeve of mine.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive as was service overall. The atmosphere was clean and inviting and the open kitchen was attractive. Rest rooms had an luxurious local business hand soap. Sanitary rating was 98.  Overall though, I found it to be the typical, somewhat pricey South Park restaurant that saturate the area. Yes, it was good, which is why I give it four stars, yet aside from the rating, it was nothing special for its area which is why I can't call it a Gotta Try. Still, if you are in the area, it is definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Feel like food quality has been going downhill here. We tend to go a few times a year but went to lunch recently and had fried oysters and the crab cake entree. Fried oysters were nice but the oysters themselves were super small. Lots of fried breading, not much oyster meat.   The crab cakes were misadvertised. If there was crab in them I must have missed it. I definitely tasted the \"cake\", and the green onions and green pepper. Just wasn't able to discern any crab in them. Served over a big bunch or boiled new potatoes. For $17 against what was likely $2 food cost (i.e. no crab) it's a great margin item for the restaurant, but a terribly disappointing order for its paying customers.   Service was good as always. So they get two stars for that.   Maybe try something else if we go back for dinner at some point.",

My party ordered the baked pimento cheese, crab hushpuppies, and pork belly appetizers to start. For 5 people, the 3 apps were perfect to start. Each one was wonderful and was a fun twist on classic southern stables. For the main courses our table the pork shank, 2 of the scallops and boar, the duck breast, and KC strip steak. While all of the dishes were amazing, I believe everyone had a bit of food envy when the pork shank arrived. It very large portion and my dad said it was outstanding! We ordered a couple side with our meal and the seared sweet potatoes were definitely the favorite of the table. We also had the beets and the succotash. We probable didn't need the sides but they were so good! We had someone in our party who is dairy free and most dishes were adjusted to accommodate this dietary restriction. Our waiter was very nice and very knowledgeable about the menu. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and we can't wait to come back here!",

    "text": "My friend and I visited Dogwood one weeknight and were able to walk right in. I had come on the recommendation of a friend. I have been to Dresslers countless times but was looking forward to trying a more modern, elevated farm to table menu. Word of warning to the ladies: Weeknights are full of tables of dudes (I assume business meetings) who leer at you as you walk by, even if you're wearing modest, business attire.  Despite being a new spot, the interiors are quite underwhelming. I expected a \"wow\" factor like the awesome wood wall of wine in the Met location but there was nothing special about the very chain feeling restaurants. They had photos of the farms that the food allegedly came from, but no labels, so it looked like a bunch of random photos if you didn't know. Similarly, the menu didn't have any mention of what farms anything came from, so I think that was a missed opportunity. The thing that particularly bothered us about the interior- it was incredibly loud so we had a hard time having a conversation. As a result, I would not recommend it as a good first date place!  The bar menu is perusable on an ipad which is either cool or off-putting depending on your style. I tried a Moscow Mule which was lovely and my friend tried one drink that was not to her taste so she switched to a rosemary lemonade.   When looking at the menu I surprisingly had a really hard time finding what to order because I don't eat pork and much of menu is pig-related or cheese related (my friend is lactose intolerant). Some of the dinner snacks looked good but it was late so we went straight for the entree. I believe their menu changes quite regularly, which is good for seasonality but bad if you find something you like that you'd like to order again.   I ordered the cioppino like a good San Franciscan, and it was a little different than traditional, but I really enjoyed it. The seafood wasn't cooked to death and was very tender. it seemed like a good value at $18 because the seafood was plentiful. I always like a cioppino with a nice sourdough of course, but a crusty paisano bread is a passable accompaniment.  My friend had a trout with quinoa and ramps (why are ramps so popular all of a sudden?) and the trout was lovely with a very flavorful topping, but the quinoa was terribly bland. The dessert menu was lacking anything interesting, so we skipped dessert (which never happens).  The service started great but then fell off and it wasn't clear who was our server. It took a good 20 minutes to get our credit card back to sign. At the end of the meal, we both wondered if we'd return.",

Brad explained the specials to us and was very knowledgable when it came to answering our questions. We ordered the roasted mussels (a starter), tiger fish, (a special), roasted sweet potatoes, (a side), squash and kale (a special). Each dish was large enough to share and each dish was absolutely delicious!  For dessert we shared the toasted pound cake with a scoop of vanilla gelato. Again, it was ample for 2.

The exterior does not do Dogwood justice - the interior is dark, warm and has a restored farmhouse rustic vibe. Really like the rescued wood fixtures throughout!  Similar to Dresslers, service is top-notch. Everyone from the bartenders to our server were gracious, patient and informative. I had noted in the reservation that it was our anniversary and both our server and Jon Dressler himself congratulated us.   The menu is fairly long with many sharing options - we ordered the oysters, warm pimento, and mushrooms to start. All three were very good with the mushrooms being exceptional! We also had the market salad, which had a great fennel dressing.  Feeling full we decided to share the grouper - our server had it split for us and the separate portions were just right. Excellent flavor profile, fresh and light.  We finished the night with a slice of the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake - great as always.  Great experience, we will be back!",

The meal itself was in the typical price range of fine dining establishments, about $150 for two of us with an appetizer, a couple of drinks, two entrees and a shared dessert.  We had dinner with another restaurant owner in town and his wife.   What blew me away was this:  After dinner, my wife and I, and the other couple we were with, went to the bar for a nightcap.  I had a Tanqueray  and tonic, my wife had a coffee with a shot of Baileys, and my buddy had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  His wife had tap water.  The bill was $58 with a 15% tip.  Rip off.  Other than that, a great place to eat.  Just stay away from the bar.",

    "text": "What a beautiful space all around. We visited at the end of brunch hour so it was a bit quiet. The brunch menu offers a pretty standard fare with some creative touches. My chopped cob salad was a bit garlicky with chicken seasoned with just a bit too much rosemary so I only enjoyed a few pieces and I wished there was more lettuce. The steak and egg dish had nicely prepared steak. Two things we couldn't wrap our heads around - the pre mixed Bloody Mary and more importantly the inability for the chef to make a simple egg white for our youngest. Truly - we're one of the few guests and all you need to do is remove the yolks - we'd pay extra to keep her happy. It's these touches that will win you that extra love from your guests. It's, in my opinion, an easy accommodation. We wouldn't necessarily go out of our way to return but a nice location with friendly staff.",

Full of so much unique flavor, and cooked to perfection. I also had a couple of their cocktails, my favorite was the rye whiskey with a smoke flavor. This was a great after dinner drink... paired it with the cheesecake for desert. Top all the great food, the decor with the phenomenal service we received and this place is in my top 10.  After dinner we had a night cap at the bar, which had TVs, so I didn't have to miss the NFL playoffs . Great place to have a drink and appetizers if you're not in the mood for a full sit down dinner.",

First off, shout to a spectacular gem of True hospitality Adi- being in service for over 2 decades now I'm not usually overly impressed even in fine dining realms...but this gent wasnt even our server and was with us every step of the way..clearing dishes, gifted cocktails that were extras at the bar, talked food, wine, vacations and love with us on our special night out. Menu and wine list were incredible. We did the crab hushpuppies and clams and pappardelle..paired with cocktails and blange white wine, entrees of Kc strip although overcooked was delish and the chanterelles, and heavenly gnocchi saved this dish, we tried the house pasta dish which was tagliatelle, sunburst Tom's, and heavy cheese..rich and perfect with the rosso wine pairing. Of course we shared chocolate grenache cake and iced dogwood coffee which was sublime.   We are fortunate to share great meals executed with perfection often here locally but this was an exceptional service night for us. Thanks to our kind, professional, new foodie friend in adi. Cheers sir. See you soon!",

We started with apps, and the bacon jam was delicious! For my entree, I had fish and it was the perfect size and the flavor was spot on. The waiter knew we were having a celebration, so they gave us a couple of complimentary deserts which were delicious and we really appreciated it!  Our waiter was awesome. He was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Another waiter dropped a dish right behind me, and he felt so bad about startling me that he gave me a card for a free appetizer on my next visit - not necessary but very appreciated!   Overall this restaurant is delicious and I can't wait to visit again!!",

I got myself a glass of rose and a couple of oysters to start. I also got a butter lettuce salad that came with watermelon and peaches and crumbled feta; it was fresh and delicious. For my main I had tagliatelle with loads of ramps and squash; I really enjoyed it. And then, because I'm a fatso, I had chocolate pie for dessert.

Our primary bartender worked in sync with the other and were very attentive. We decided it was going to be an all appetizer kind of night to really get some variety!  The appetizers came out as they were prepared and we were fine with that - what we ate:  Pimento Cheese with bread and their infamous bacon jam - classic gooey goodness.  Brisket with pickled onions - nice sized bites with deep smoke flavor and tang from the onions.  Aranicini - who doesn't like Italian style deep fried risotto/rice balls?  NC Shrimp - nicely done with tempura style seasonal veggies.  Arugula Salad with market fresh peaches - double yum.  And last but not least - Chocolate Pie with Market Berry Coulis - dense, chocolately, delicious!  We came on a Wednesday and they were running a house made cocktail special for $5 - great deal for Dogwood as most of their cocktails run $10-15. Add to that hand pressed coffee!  Only ball dropped was the salad which we had to remind them of - a sous chef brought it out personally though with his apologies.  Overall, great place for a date night to try some great food and drinks!",

    "text": "Love this little strip of places tucked behind the Whole Foods (Whole Foods itself is a bit of a different story, but I digress). One evening after coming from the airport, decided on a whim to see if we could get into Dogwood, and wouldn't you know it, they were absolutely packed. And we were utterly out of place, in traveling clothes. They made room. Awesome.  Now Dogwood isn't fancy or anything, but still, we were out of place. This is entirely on us, but from the welcome to the server, they were absolutely excellent. Even though we had no reservation (and they were packed), they slid us in. To be fair, we were tucked behind the brick column were no one could see us, but that's okay. It may have done a bit to dampen the noise - which can be considerable when the place is packed (which is often).  When it comes to food, there is plenty to choose from, and that is just on the appetizer menu. There are some interesting choices, such as the roasted oysters that come out chilled (not really sure how that works) and the cheese plate that doesn't have much cheese on it.  The real star here, beyond the service, is the 48 hour duck and dumplings. It tastes nothing like the duck you are used to. No gaminess and more importantly it just falls apart. If you don't like to share, or just want to keep it for yourself, get two. Well worth it.",

Shrimp was perfectly cooked and good medium size.   We also had crab cakes with a smoked pepper jelly....  soooo good.  The crab cakes were good, nothing spectacular but very good.

I like my food hot or at least warm... they had good flavor and size but I was turned off by them bring room temp, like they just been sitting... my hand cut fries were great but hey they are just fries...  several coworkers got the steak and it looked amazing!

The restaurant is dim and upscale and the prices were a bit much for the portion I received.  The crab cakes were ok but I expected them to be delish and they were not and for $17 I need more than average.

    "text": "In town on business, and I like to always support local. I had high hopes, given the ratings on yelp. I ordered the collard greens and baked pimento cheese for my meal. The collard greens came out almost cold, and the baked pimento cheese was fairly lukewarm and VERY salty.    Being a solo business traveler, I sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and provided great service. I'll chalk my food experience up to the fact that maybe they are still working out kitchen-to-table kinks? No way should collard greens be served in an adorable skillet that isn't even remotely warm.  I'll give them a second try on my next visit.",

    "text": "Fabulous restaurant! Wonderful atmosphere and food though a little loud when it fills up and reservations are a must on the weekend. We shared the hushpuppies, baked pimento cheese, and octopus and chorizo appetizers. By far, the octopus and chorizo was the table favorite. Don't be alarmed, when they say octopus, they use the whole octopus tentacle to bell. Ask your server for extra bread to soak up the marinade. The lamb was perfectly cooked as was the wild boar. The NC Flank and Duck leg (tonight it was boar in place of bison) came with a nice balsamic glazed and roasted corn salad. This kitchen sets the example of how to cook scallops. Perfectly seasoned and lightly seared. Most of the desserts are old recipes from the Chef's mother. The cheesecake is my recommendation. It has the flavor of a New York cheesecake but in contrast, it's light and fluffy. The lightest cheesecake I've ever had. It makes me disappointed in my cheesecake attempts at home. Overall great restaurant and I'll be back when I'm in Charlotte again.",

    "text": "We chose here for restaurant week, and...it's a winner!   Someone made mention that it was \"on par\" with Treehouse.  Now having been here, I put it a couple of notches up, especially with how nice it is inside and the ambiance.  It feels more cozy and welcoming.  I believe we tried almost a little bit of everything:  Drinks: Rum Old Fashioned - Possibly the best one I've had in Charlotte, it is my go-to drink. Tito's Mule - This one started out watered down, so we sent it back.  What came back was spot on perfect. Chardonnay - Why bother when the mixed drinks are so good?  Openers: Pimento Cheese - To die for.  Melted, lots of pimento, with crispy bread. Bacon Jam - Better than to die for.  I ended up eating most of mine with a spoon. Arugula Salad - My wife had this.  Not sure why when we had the above but OK we got some greens.  I had a bite, it was good but...see above.  Mains: Trout - Heard it was delicious. Duck - Heard it was delicious. Sirloin - Hmm.  Possibly a stumbling point.  We ordered two, Medium Rare and Medium.  They came out the same, and if anything they were RARE and a bit rubbery.  Could be the cut.  At least the leftovers should reheat well without killing it.  Sides: Macaroni & Cheese - Quite good! Collard Greens - I've yet to like these, so my opinion is moot.  Heard they were a bit over the top with vinegar, though.  Desserts: Pots de creme - Solid. Carrot cake - Good. Cheesecake - Downright awesome.  Light.  Fluffy.  The waiter made mention that most \"things\" (e.g. bitters, ginger beer, and more) are homemade, and this becomes perfectly clear early and often.  Speaking of our waiter, \"James from Cleveland\" was great.  He is a wealth of information, made fantastic recommendations, and everything was right on time and as it should be.  By the way, if you check in on yelp you may get a coupon for a free dessert.  I saved mine for next time :)  We are glad to have tried Dogwood for restaurant week, and are looking forward to coming back soon!!",

The manager at least made things right by comping some of our food, but we didn't appreciate the overall experience. I'm very disappointed to say I will not be returning.",

The sausage was flavorful and good. Dumplings had tons of sauce and good flavor. The duck was a bit dried out to my taste, but had good sauce to pair. The ambiance was great, even a bit louder than you'd think. Seems like groups like to gather here rather than just people on dates, which is good to know! They have a pretty extensive drink menu as well. Our server was a young gentleman and was top notch. Hostess staff was very respectful as well. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Charlotte is now a large enough city that it's easy to neglect one area of town while pursuing excellent cuisine in another. I'm sorry to say that South Park (for these Matthews residents) is the area that got neglected. I thought of it as eclipsed by chain restaurants, and didn't realize until recently that there were gems that needed discovering.   One of those gems is Dogwood Southern Table and Bar. They offer not only gourmet Southern cuisine, but the best cocktails in town.   Adi was our excellent server and he was an expert guide of the varied menu. We had excellent food in our wild boar and shrimp and grits and terrific beverages, as well.   This was a special occasion for us and that did not go unnoted by the staff. We had glasses of champagne and a fantastic cheesecake to enjoy (courtesy of the restaurant) for our special day.  Parking was easy...there is a \"P\" parking sign leading patrons to the rear of the restaurant. There's a walkway through the garage to the premises.   I'm gluten free and there were many options and a very customizable menu. I ended up with the pimento cheese appetizer with carrots, and shrimp and grits. Both were delectable.   My husband and I will return and be sure to bring others with us next time.",

Very close to being a five star experience, but service had several stumbles that made it just below.  Had a house made charcuterie plate which was excellent.  Four or five homemade sausages that were interesting and different, all really good and well presented.  For entrees we had a scallop and boar special which was truly special and a bone in strip that was very good.  Everything was well cooked and well seasoned.  Added a side of the collard greens which are the best I've ever had - rich and nutty with a splash of heat.  Finished up with a homemade carrot cake and coffee both of which were excellent.  Service was friendly and mostly good.  Waited a few times, for drinks, between courses, and for an extended period after we got the check (ya know when you don't get card out in time and the server bolts?  Yeah, that).

It is always dimly lit, but not too dark. Atmosphere is great, it is never too quiet or loud. Parking can be a possible issue depending on what time you go. Just plan to valet, as it is complimentary. Also, if you plan to stop in for a drink at the bar anytime after 6:15pm-6:30pm, do not expect to find many open seats. Just order a drink, and wait for people to get called to their table to eat.  All beer, wine and specialty drinks are on their iPad menu. There is a top shelf bourbon menu that can be requested. Brian makes the best craft cocktails in South Charlotte, if not the entire city. Even if you don't see something you love on the iPad, just tell him what you are in the mood for. He does not hesitate in making your craft cocktail, and it is always beyond amazing and well thought out to this most minute detail.    Food is always excellent and service is top notch every time.. Keep in mind, M-F 5pm-6ish they have a $5 burger special that comes with steak fries and $1 oysters in the bar area only. Over time we have had the Bacon Jam, Pimento Cheese, NC Shrimp, Carolina Dumplings, raw VA Oysters, Burger special, Seared Scallops, Shrimp and Grits, Mac and Cheese, Collards and this week the Oreo Cheesecake Gelato. Nothing is ever short of amazing. If you are in South Charlotte, this is your go-to dinner destination!",

    "text": "Enjoyed opening weekend Saturday nite.  The restaurant was really busy, but the owner personally seated every guest.  We arrived early to enjoy a drink at the bar.  The bartender and mixologist were hopping with a full house, but helped me find the perfect red wine for my taste and my hubby gave his dirty martini 2 thumbs up!  The couple sitting next to us at the bar were enjoying drinks that had been custom made to their taste buds and enjoying a second.  We were seated at our reservation time and our waiter and staff were very attentive.  My hubby enjoyed 6 oysters as a appetizer and said they were terrific.  We also gave the bacon jam a try!  Oh my!  It's a must try....not too salty or to sweet....amazing!  My husband's Mahi was cooked to perfection, as was my medium steak.  The portion sizes were perfect, not too large or too small.  I did splurge and finish the evening off with a cup of the decaf French press coffee and the toasted pound cake....yum!  Don't miss out on this tasty place!  The atmosphere is quaint, even a bar at the kitchen if you want to see how it's done.  I'm dying to go back soon with some girlfriends for lunch....that menu looked great too!",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying: this is my first Yelp Review of any business but I exclusively choose businesses based on yelp reviews.  This was my first time at Dogwood Southern Table and Bar and I chose the restaurant based on the reviews.   The Service: The service started incredible slow and our waitress wasn't on the clock until about 15 min after we sat down so we weren't even greeted by her until then. Even after that - I must say that the service was absolutely amazing. She was attentive but not overbearing, she made great recommendations which me and my company both decided on. In addition, she went above and beyond and offered us free dessert based on a comment about our favorite desserts.   The Food: The recommendations the waitress made was absolutely superb. The Wild Boar (trust me - I was weary about it too) dish was one of the best dishes I've had in Charlotte. I also had a glass of wine that I asked the waitress to bring based on her pairing recommendation - it was a perfect match.   The down side is that it's far from uptown, especially when you have after work reservations and the traffic is insane, and sits in South Park. It's also a bit pricey but it's totally work the money. I absolutely will come have dinner here again. Great atmosphere- Great Service- Incredible food.",

    "text": "We took some co-workers here who were in from out of town last night. To be honest this was the third place I tried to find a table at for 11. However Dogwood was able to find room for us.  A few of us got there early and the place was packed!! Typical for the holiday season though. We went up to the bar, perused the ipad menu and ordered some drinks as we waited for our party. I got the Mountain Door Malbec which was rather nice actually. I ended up sticking with that for the night.   As for starters we were rather hungry and tried a few things.  I heard the oysters were good although I didn't try them myself. We got the crab pups which I loved!! They describe them as like crab hushpuppies... I would say they are more like mini ball shaped crab cakes but regardless yummy!! We also got the pimento cheese dip. I was a bit afraid to try this one as I am not a pimento cheese fan. However this stuff was AMAZING!! So addictive and it did not last long on the table. The dip is topped with their bacon jam which lets face it tasted as fantastic as it sounds. One of the guys also ordered the homemade chips for the table which were great to snack on.   I personally decided to go for the Thyme Gnocchi... the description kept calling to me from the menu. When it arrived I was a bit disappointed. It did not look appetizing really, and a lovely medium rare steak was sitting across from me lol. However I ate the entire place and it was delicious!! I do feel like maybe it was a tad one note and could have used something to break it up, but honestly it was still good :) The picture I took makes it look way better, so I think the very dimmed lighting was part of why it didn't look great.   One thing about this place is that it is VERY loud. I've run into this with many new restaurants lately. It was a bit difficult to talk unless the person was sitting right next to you, and even then it could be difficult to hear. I'd say that is a downside and normally I'd dock a star for that, but honestly... bacon jam!!   All in all I shall return promptly with some family, or friends, or maybe even alone to try some of the other dishes including the toasted pound cake which I heard is good!!",

    "text": "Dogwood is delicious. But more than that, the service is AMAZING. My parents and I went while celebrating my mom's birthday in Charlotte back in December. Two months (to the day, actually), I am STILL upset I wasn't able to eat my leftovers. (I was driving back to Louisville the next morning, and I'm not sure a pork loin with polenta would've made it back in a neat manner.)   They have a full bar, including some some more \"hard to find\" liquors, which my dad had in bourbon. My mom wasn't sure on a wine, so they let her sample it before committing to a full glass. I stuck with water, but refills were plentiful (always appreciated).  We started with the Carolina Dumplings (I seriously could've licked the bleu cheese out of the dish... SO tasty.) and the Bacon Jam (DUH.). Since we were first timers, the chef also sent us a small bite before that, if I recall the timing, which was so cool and cute.   I can't remember what my parents got, but I do remember my dad cleaned his plate, and my mom likely chowed down on her leftovers the next day. Again, I'm still sad I didn't get a chance to eat mine--it was so tasty and well done.  They brought my mom something delicious for dessert. I was so full by that point, I only took a little bite. She loved it though; it was a perfect stop for a birthday celebration. Our server walked us through everything and was great while not being overbearing with suggestions, etc. I wish I remembered his name; he was good! In other notes, they do have valet parking. The menu rotates, and they focus on local and seasonal items. While it's slightly pricey (depending on how you do it), the service, taste, and quality totally are worth it. I would happily go back here when in Charlotte again!  Note: I would highly recommend reservations!",

Our waitress was super helpful and patient, and made some great recommendations. We started with the hush puppies and some pimento cheese, both were really good, the bacon topping on the cheese was delicious. I had the fish special which was cooked brilliantly--crispy skin, roasted veggies, pickled shishito peppers and some harissa sauce, it was amazing. My wife had the roast chicken which she loved, and our friend had the shrimp and grits which were also a hit. Our waitress recommended we try the cheesecake, even offering it on the house since it was our first time there and all the desserts are based off of the owners moms recipes, she wasn't wrong, definitely one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, super light and fluffy! Can't wait to come back!",

Positives: - Food was served promptly - They were accommodating in making a vegetarian meal option (substituted fruit for bacon)  Negatives:  - ALL the food was too salty. All I could taste in the eggs and biscuits was salt. An hour later, I can still taste salt in my mouth. The grits were good, but the rest of the meal was disgusting.  - We were offered \"coffee\" (in quotation marks because it wasn't otherwise qualified), and then charged $3 (plus tax) for each cup thereafter as an \"Americano.\" Waitress never offered, nor did we order, an Americano or specialized drink. She kept offering more \"coffee,\" and given that customarily at American brunch, regular coffee is chargeable ONCE with nonchargeable refills, it was reasonable to assume that this is what we had ordered. $20 later, we were misled - by omission - into ordering 5 cups of subpar machine coffee. This is incredibly disingenuous, and frankly, offensive.  I had heard great things about this restaurant. Will definitely not be going back.",

Our favorite app is the pimento cheese.  The only thing I was ever unimpressed with was the French Toast.",

    "text": "Was lucky to get an invite for my sweetie and I to attend a soft opening for them on Friday night.  We had the Gulf and East Coast Oysters (Thank you Mr. Dressler!), Fontina Cheese Appetizer, House Salad, Scallops with Squash, Steak with Mashed Potatoes and a side of Au Gratin Potatoes and for dessert an Apple Empanada and a Chocolate Cake.  We drank the Vouvray, which is oh, so drinkable with everything!  The oysters were amazing, especially the Gulf Oysters.  I'm from Florida, so this was a True taste of home.  The salad was dressed well and was crisp and fresh.  The Fontina Cheese Appetizer was buttery and tasty.  It needed a couple more pieces of toast.  The only negative is the cheese firms up fairly quickly and so spreading it on the toast becomes less effective, especially when you take a bite and the whole smear of cheese comes off of the toast.  The Scallops had a good flavor and were cooked well.  They were a bit on the cool side though.  The Collard Greens that came with them were good as well.  The Arugala drizzle was a nice flavor, but it was a cold drizzle I wish it had been a hot drizzle.  Might have helped the temp of the scallops.  The squash that came with it was good, but I wish they had been a different color as they looked like the scallops.  Also a bit on the cool side.  The Steak with Mashed Potatoes was very good.  It was closer to rare temp, which we both appreciate, but we asked for medium well.  It had a great, fresh flavor though.  The Mashed Potatoes were oh, so, good!  (better than Dressler's).  The Au Gratin Potatoes were tasty, seemed as if it was the fontina cheese over the potatoes.  It was supposed to have onions it it, but we couldn't find any.  The Apple Empanada was tasty, but the crust was a bit like a pop tart... a little dry and crumbly but luckily - I love pop tarts.  The caramel drizzle was really good.  The Chocolate Cake was tasty, but again, a bit dry.  Not as moist as I expected.  I know I'm being very critical of everything, but we gave the same feedback at the restaurant, so I'm just re-iterating it.  We enjoyed everything we ate and getting everything tweaked to the Chef Scotts' high standards (not mine) is the goal.  The restaurant design is really nice with interesting wood joists placed high in the ceiling as well as really cool photos of various scenes from the local food providers they use.  There is an expansive bar area with extended seating and 2 fireplaces.  The bar is sleek and modern looking but still welcoming and comfortable.  We definitely look forward to getting back to Dogwood's soon and trying some more of their delicious choices!",

My $4 Trader Joe's soup at home tastes like 3 star Michelin comparing to this.

For lunch I had the steak flank and duck and I must say it was great. After dinner I had the pound cake for dessert. I will say for pound cake it was really good. It wasn't dry and was served with a side of soft serve ice cream. I also had the gelato. It was unique because at first I really wasnt enjoying it, but after my pallet adjusted it was delicious. Im definitely coming back here.",

It's the kind of food that's incredibly satisfying far beyond just being satiated. Truly an experience that is adventurous, but not overly unfamiliar or stuffy. Flavors that make you say, \"wow, that's the perfect marriage!\" But you'd have never though of on your own (or most wouldn't). The wait staff is AMAZING. We did not get our beloved Chris this time, but Drew did a great job, and Chris remembered us and sent a couple amazing bites to our table. The service, space, even the drinks are top notch and I believe this is our new 'spot'. Highly recommend trying Dogwood, regardless of your palate. High-end casual, relaxed and an absolute gem in Queen Charlotte's crown.",

    "text": "I really like Dogwood. Their food when they get it right is great! When they don't it's a total bummer. Such a roller coaster of emotions from appetizer to dessert! I was taking a friend here to try it out because I thought it'd be a nice casual southern food experience. It's not really very casual but it is tasty. Dress a little more nicely than usual.  The atmosphere here creates a lot of hustle and bustle resulting in a very lively dining experience. Our waitress is a very nice lady though quite pushy with the drink orders. I didn't want a drink that night however. It's a nice menu you just point at stuff on the ipad they give you, no paper!  We started out with the sauteed octopus with chorizo and this dish knocked it out of the park! The spice from the chorizo combined with tender octopus and some braised greens really make for a great flavor combination in one bite. I almost wanted to order another one and make it my entree.  My duck was disappointingly deficient compared to the great appetizer. I appreciate a medium rare duck a lot but this thing could have quacked it was so raw. As it was pretty dark I didn't notice until I took a bite and took 5 minutes to chew a piece. I do not think it rested an appropriate amount of time either as there was a lot of blood running around this plate. After I noted this to our waitress she apologized and got it sent back for another round. It was a lot more edible after this however I don't think it was as good as it could have been if it had been done right the first time. What a shame.  Thanks for a decent (though expensive) night Dogwood! I look forward to seeing if my next trip will be an improvement.",

The food was everything we could have hoped for and they even made an exception to accommodate me on a menu item they no longer had.  The toasted pound cake is a \"must try\".

I witnessed some kitchen staff handling food with bare hands and eating some of the meat they were slicing. Add to note, they didn't wash their hands after eating the meat slice which is a health code violation.   My server stopped by only twice: to take my order and take my money.   I noticed how well he treated the table next to me, throughly covering the menu and explaining the mission of being an eatery of locally sourced food.  I was considering this place for a company event, but they lost my business.  I suggest treating clients better and with respect. It was rude service per se, but just lack of service. The food is a great and priced accordingly. So they would have been much higher if they made an effort to appreciate my business.",

Ah, to my dismay we walked in and table cloths, Waiters and we were early so they were all just standing around waiting on the crowd to come in looking out the window like you would expect me to do being my first time. LOL  But service was ok, and with the lack of business he seemed to be able to talk to his fellow servers while the wife waited for him to come back for wine/drink order.  He was friendly and seemed to still just run a little slow in his reaction time but once we figured that out it became an expectation, he was not so bad, and had nice presence about him.  Food was very good, and hot, and after my initial dismay, sort of liked this place but again, it was just the name that threw me.  I am sure we will go back, in fact I looking forward to it.

The boyfriend and I were looking for a brunch place we hadn't tried before and this is one we probably won't return to. We arrived and were seated in the \"lounge area\" aka, the bar.  There was one or two other couples there as well.  I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Quail (which came with Blueberry sauce and Buckwheat johnny cakes) and he ordered the Walnut French Toast.  We also ordered a basket of \"Maw Maw's Biscuits\" and two coffees.  To start, the coffee was very good.  It was French Press though so you really only got a 6oz cup, but it was very good.  Two out of the three biscuts were tough and dry, but when each biscuit cost $2 each, they better be the best biscuts i'd ever tasted, so our meal was already off to a not so hot start.  The Walnut French toast was quite good and the portion was huge, two people could easily split.  The Johnny cakes that came with my meal were good, the quail was bland, and I had to ask for salt and pepper as there wasn't any on the table. All in all, our bill came to $48 before tip.  I don't think that the brunch at this place was worth what we paid for for it.  From now on, I'm sticking to Terrace Cafe, at least if i'm going to pay $50, the food will be good enough to be worth it.",

We should have tried some of the other snacks and small plates offered. For our entrees I had the shrimp and grits with I really enjoyed; the shrimp were a great size and perfectly cooked. My husband had the special of the evening which was snapper. It definitely missed the mark: very fishy and overly salty (and I like salty food).

Sad I didn't get to try the chicken entree but they were out that night along with the pasta. The pimento Mac & Cheese was delish!",

From the front door host, to the wait staff, to the bartenders, to the owners, everyone is well versed on the offerings and have treated me like a special guest every time.  The kitchen bar is fun if you like the interaction, the full bar is spacious and the dining room has a modern luxurious feel without losing coziness.  This is my new favorite in town!  Amazing dishes and drinks!  Foodie heaven!",

We had a party of three but ended up seated next to an acquaintance who was having their featured entree-bison and lambchop. The aroma was too alluring to resist. As others have stated the pimento appetizer with bacon jelly is over the top good. Yes, it was loud but not in an obnoxious, beer bar kinda way. People were enjoying the dining experience and the comfortable, sleek setting. The complimentary valet was \"icing on the cake\", as they say. I will definitely  be going back very soon.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place because I love their other restaurant Dresslers.  We got seated right away and noticed that I could not hear anyone seated at my table. They have done a terrible job with ambient noise control, which definitely affects the experience. We had a nice server who was very attentive. Drinks were good and appetizers were very good. I recommend the bacon jam along with the warm pimento cheese spread. The fried oysters were solid, but I did get one with a shell that almost broke my tooth.  The entrees were not very good. In fact, mine was terrible. I ordered the special bone in pork chop and this dish was just a mess. The chop was undercooked and chewy with a huge amount of fat. I've never seen a cut this bad. Then to make it worse, it was loaded with salt. I had two bites of this dish. One of my friends ordered the ribeye and for $42 he thought he would get a decent size piece of meat. No, he got what looked like a sirloin. He hated it. The rest of the crew had fish and this seems like a better choice if you decide to go to this disappointing restaurant.  Lastly, this meal cost $200 for two and it simply is not a good value. I'm not sure why they feel they have the right to charge $34 for 4 scallops. They were good, but that price is ridiculous. So, this will be a one and done for all of us who went last night.  Charlotte has way too many great restaurants to return to this one. I'll stil go to Dresslers, where this team gets it right. Dogwood is for the dogs!",

    "text": "I was very excited about this restaurant opening in South Charlotte and done by local restaurant owners. It is billed as farm to table with local, fresh ingredients.  The interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It's located in South Park.    To be fair, we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn't know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle, and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine, they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So, the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection, I was told \"of course, we aren't THAT restaurant\".  However, when he checked the wine, it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.  We ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However, I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn't have any.  Later, the waitress brought green tabasco but that's absolutely not the same.   I ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.  The entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets, a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn't do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway, I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked, the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was \"ok\".  That once again, he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn't have sausage).  He didn't seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note, my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding.   The owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother's recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However, he did not apologize for the experience, thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park.",

Our meal was compted after having to tell them, and then we were ignored never asked for dessert or coffee. Poor show of service and overall experience.
