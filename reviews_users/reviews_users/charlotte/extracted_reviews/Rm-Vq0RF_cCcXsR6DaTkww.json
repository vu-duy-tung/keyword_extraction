There is confusion with regard to matching names & numbers which affects whether you get the right pizza. The pizzas are not consistent anymore, whether you get one that actually looks appetizing or doesn't have a fistful of garlic on it depends on who makes your pizza. Please train your employees better.",

Got a create your own pizza and went down the line choosing toppings.  Also got garlic knots for myself and my daughter.  After creating they cook it in the wood fired oven.  Pizza was delicious.. and fairly quick which is great at lunch.  My favorite thing was they had several flavored waters and lemonades with the drinks.  I got a blood orange lemonade which was wonderful!! I loved that they had options besides soda or water and especially since I don't like a lot of caffeine the lemonade made a very flavorful choice.  The only negative I have (and it's not the restaurants fault) is the is very very little parking in the strip mall.",

I have eaten a lot of pizza over the years and have grown tired of the normal chain places. I dont care for the thick crust and I like the ability to walk in and make it just like I want it when it comes to veggies, sauce, cheese etc. They also have a decent variety of drinks and offer salad selections. Beware you may not be able to finish the individual pizza it is very filling. There usually is a line when you go but it is worth the wait.",

I usually get a basic pepperoni pizza with red sauce , mozzarella and parmesan cheese , which is so good I don't even try anything else, yet Blaze has so much more to offer. Know that the dough is made fresh daily. The meat toppings are nitrate free, and free of other additives and preservatives. Blaze is a place where there is something for everyone , especially the health conscious . This location is conveniently located in the boardwalk area of University City and is definitely a place you should visit.",

I love the concept of being able to put whatever I want on a pizza because I can never decide in the first place.  It also has a great selection of fresh salads and sides including great chocolate cookies you can add on for dessert.  I also love the fact they have Mexican Coke available in the bottle.  This alone is usually a mark of a place that knows what they are doing and really care about the small things.  Quality all around here and I must say I really like the location as it is tucked away but very open with adequate outdoor seating when the weather permits.  My one regret is that I did not try the unique lemonade combinations they had on tap.  Will return!",

    "text": "Hands down 5 stars for the name! It was funny telling the guy starting my order that my name was Blaze... he took a bit of a double take.  It's worth noting that everyone here seemed very happy and willing to help- obviously this team was trained very well!  This place is cool, definitely a unique concept. It's similar to a subway, but with pizza. You choose your crust (regular, thick, or gluten free) and then you either choose one of their recipes or you choose your own toppings. You can get unlimited toppings on your personal pizza and it only costs about 8 dollars. Once your done selecting toppings, they \"fast fire\" the pizza in the oven for 3 minutes, very quick... while I was paying, my order was already in the oven, and after I filled my drink it was done. They also have salads and desserts, I didn't try these, but they looked very good.   Was the pizza the best I've ever had? No... but it certainly wasn't bad. I'd like to try the thicker crust next time. The thin crust wasn't crispy like you'd usually expect... but rather kind of mushy.  Still good, just not for everybody. The topping selection was great (so much to choose from), but the taste of those toppings wasn't really anything to rave about. Again, not bad at all, just not the best.   They have a wide variety of artisan type drinks, lemonades, sodas, etc. I liked their tea and I also tried one of their fruit beverages... both very good.   Overall, I would certainly recommend giving this place a try... the pizza was good... and you might even love this places unique culinary style. If not, you'll certainly love the concept, atmosphere, and friendly staff.",

From sauce to cheese to meats to veggies, and there is no up charge,  you can get as many toppings as you want.  They throw in the fire oven and a few minutes later it's ready. The crust is so crisp from the oven my it's delicious. It's  $8.50 for a pizza with unlimited toppings. Also, they get busy during lunch, may want to go a little early!",

For (I think) $8.50, you can get a personal pizza with unlimited toppings OR half a custom pizza and garlic knots. The staff was polite, my food came fast (despite being 12:30), and it was somewhat quiet while still crowded. Good, cheap, fast. What more do you need?",

However, when we were on line watching the staff make our pizzas, one of their workers did NOT pull their long hair back.. and so her braids were dragging all over the pizzas (yes it was touching the food she was preparing). We talked to the manager immediately, to which he had her pull her hair back and work on other tasks. They offered to remake our pizzas so that was good, but HOW in the world did they not notice this?!? And how long was her hair touching people's food?? No idea, but that's a big health code violation. Gross. UPDATE*** The owner reached out to me and seemed very concerned with my issue. This doesn't seem like a common occurrence and the company, from what I can tell, strives to make sure everything is up to code. I am very pleased with the way this was resolved and I can definitely tell they care about their customers. I Will be going back!!",

    "text": "I've been waiting to review this one because I simply wanted to try as many things as possible before doing so. The first pizza I had at Blaze was \"Build Your Own\", and I went crazy. Red sauce, two different types of mozzarella, turkey meatballs, chicken, olives, banana peppers....I can keep going but I can't remember it all lol! This delicious concoction went into a wood fired oven and was topped off with a pesto drizzle at the end! Wow, It was great!   I told myself that if I can literally throw the kitchen sink of ingredients they have to offer on a pizza and it taste as good as it did, then their signature specialties must be great too. After numerous visits, I've tried their \"Art Lover\", the \"White Top\", the \"Veg Out\", and the \"Green Stripe\". All of these variations have different flavor profiles, and are very unique. I can say I thoroughly enjoyed each of the ones I tried. Full of flavor, great textures, and just the right temperature when it comes out the oven.   Blaze Pizza uses fresh ingredients, and everything is made to order. The layout is pretty much like the \"Subway\" or \"Pita Pit\" of pizzas, where all of the toppings are laid out in front of you to choose from, and a person behind the counter builds the pizza. When you order the pizza for take out, they wait to throw it in the wood fire oven until you get there so that way you can add ingredients to your pizza and make sure it's made exactly to your liking. I also love their finishing touches. You can get drizzles like BBQ sauce, Balsamic Vinaigrette, and Pesto on top of your pizza once it comes out the oven.   The pies are individual, but you can surely share one with someone and still be full depending on what you get on top of the pizza.  Prices are very reasonable too! You can get a pie and a fountain drink for under $10!   There really isn't anything bad I can say about this place. It's really unique, affordable, convenient, and can function as a lunch or dinner option.   I recommend Blaze with utmost confidence!",

You are able to pick you own toppings or one of the specialty pizza. All pizzas are cooked with order. I also had the Kale salad, it was a little to vinegary for me. The cookies was good (I had the chocolate chip). They have fresh lemonade that is made daily, the Mango flavor is VERY LIGHT, the Lemonade flavor is VERY tart. The best flavor is the bloody orange (the name is something like that) and another good one is the Strawberry (tho' it was a very lite flavor it was not too sweet and was not watered down like the Mango flavor)  INSIDE: Nice set up, they had UNCC colors on the wall. They have high table and regular tables and outdoor seating. Tho' if the place is packed it could be a bit loud. The staff was super nice and the manager and some of the owners were nice also. Once I told the young lady that took my order,that I have never been to Blaze pizza before she explained how it work.  Location: There is a free parking in a lot, you can walk from Blaze to Boardwalk(which is a good). The location is perfect and right by other shops.   Price: great price around $6.00 and up",

For starters their crust is delicious and their sauce options are excellent, especially the garlic pesto! They have a wide variety of cheeses and protein toppings and don't forget to add some sea salt to your pizza, it's an perfect finishing touch.   The service is fast and friendly and they offer military discounts. They also have a nice outdoor seating area and parking is decent. It's also a great area to walk after you eat with some nice dessert options nearby.   Blaze is some good pizza!",

The size of pizza you get for 5.25 was a good deal as well. I just got a plain pie with a little pesto. It was pretty good, what I expect to taste when I get pizza. Next time I'll ask for it to stay in the oven a little longer. I did have a Yelp coupon upon checking in and I felt like the lady ringing me up was a little rude when she told me they do not honor them but she will only this time. It was just a free fountain drink. I was actually ok with them not honoring it but she didn't give me a chance to say anything. After cashing out she just walked away and a young man took over and he goes \"didn't you get a drink?\" And hands me a cup. I ended up getting water anyway lol. That was that . I'll get it again if I'm in the area but there won't be any special trips for it .",

The managers, Eddy and Tiffany specifically, have allowed an environment of hostility and mistreatment of their employees. The store has terrible turnover, firing employees at an unprecedented rate, and are completely okay with bigotry such as homophobia and transphobia. Slurs and hateful rhetoric is ok, as these employees get nothing but a slap on the wrist, but victims get terminated because of \"minor infractions\". Neither of these people should be running a business, and this location should be investigated for violating civil rights.",

The pizza is made in a brick oven and you can watch them do it, so you aren't just sitting there bored. Reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because fired pizza isn't my favorite because on the bottom of the pizzas there's ashes lol. Other than that this is my favorite pizza place to go to!!",

We ended up waiting almost five minutes before someone helped us (there was no one in front of us, the staff just kept preparing call-in orders and completely ignoring us), the ingredients taste fresh and good, but while there seems to be a lot of options, the options themselves seem rather limited, and I just am not a fan of the place anymore.  If someone asked me to meet them there, I'm not saying I would not go, but I'd probably suggest we meet up at Cava or Pei Wei instead. I'm sorry, I'm just not a big fan of a chain that seems more about a gimmick than about quality and customer service.",

Normally that is all it takes to give a five star review, but the service from the manager, Tony,  outshined EVEN the pizza.   We had a delivery order from Postmates that was missing a topping, Kalamata Olives, though Tony had written it down for the folks making our pizza, they still forgot them. He apologized and offered us a pizza replacement for the next day. When we came in he went above and beyond what he originally promised and was so kind. Also one couldn't help but notice Tony was on the register, he was getting pizzas from the oven, he was bussing tables, and somehow found time to check on us to make sure our pizzas were perfect this time- all with a smile. We were floored and quite thankful to get to come in even though it was originally for a mistake.  We left full and happy! We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I guess you could say my first experience with Blaze was brief... which would make since given their namesake (Fast-Fire'd Pizza). The pies themselves we're great given their price-point, but the service was a bit lacking.  After giving their neighbor, City BBQ, a try a couple of days ago, the large crowd at this new pizza joint intrigued me. I decided to skip the line and order online. Their online interface, by the way, actually works well! There are many take-out places around that have ordering apps or websites that make you believe they don't even want you ordering from them, so good on you Blaze for actually making it usable.  15 minutes after placing my order, I skip the massive line (love doing that anywhere I can!) and straight to the \"Pick-Up\" register. 2 employees we're working the register and 1 appeared to be cutting pizzas specifically for pick-up orders. After repeating my name 3 times, one to each employee who each sequentially looked at the next person like they didn't belong on that register, the guy cutting pizzas said he had my order and was cutting it.  I had 4 pizzas and he pointed to 2 boxes and said he was working on the other 2. Once my stack has accumulated to 4 I thought he would call me, after a minute or so I asked if they were ready. He said Yes, and nothing else. Grabbed my pizzas and walked out.  The whole \"customer-interaction\" part of the restaurant... it needs some fine-tuning here. I think if I hadn't said anything to anyone they wouldn't have batted an eye and I might still be there waiting on those pizzas! I'll dine in next time and see if things change. Who knows, it might have been a rough night?  So on to the pizzas. Their ingredient list is extensive, I bet you could make trillions of different combinations. The pizzas are 11\", a little bit bigger than your average \"personal\" pan, and hover around the $6-7 price range. They're going to make a killing off the college kids looking for value.  When comparing them to other budget pizza offerings around, it was outstanding! Great red sauce with that had nice spicy tang at the end. Meats (I got the meatball, salami, and pepperoni on mine) were all individually distinguishable and flavorful. Cheese was generous on my pie and great as well.  If the service is better next time, I'll be the best long-term customer they have. This is now likely the closest pizza place to the house, and while I like it, I want to LOVE it! Update Pending!",

By 10:35, I got my pizzas and sides. While there, one of my pizzas was incorrect although they were both done. Then I watched a worker go to clean and come back to the line without washing his hands. I let one of the other staff members know. Redeeming factors are that the staff members were friendly and the food delicious. I will be back to hopefully a better experience in organization.",

    "text": "UPDATE (As of 4/21)... it breaks my tummy's heart to have to remove a star from this location but they've officially deserved it.   I went to meet a friend for lunch over the weekend (around 2:15pm) and was halfway greeted by a young lady writing the orders down. I used to be in customer service so I understand the \"I don't want to work today\" mood and was ok to just ignore, as she wasn't rude... she just wasn't polite. The line started to pick up a little with a family in front of us that had a specific preference for how their sauce was put on their pizzas. I'm guessing that this young lady was annoyed by the fact that she had to pitch in to help move orders along. After saucing my friend's pizza, she started on mine. I ordered a half White Top and half Green Stripe... for the green stripe side, I asked if she could put the spicy sauce on there...She didn't acknowledge that she heard me but proceeded to complain to another young lady, preparing the dough, by stating \"I hate when it gets busy, people get dumber...\" the other young lady looked hesitantly at us and the other customers that had started forming a line and tried to remain optimistic. The complaining individual then abruptly pushed my pizza down the line, put the toppings she knew to go on each side (didn't ask me anything) and went back to take orders with a heavy sigh and a very obvious eye roll! No ma'am... that is completely unacceptable on any level. If you believe that people are \"dumb\" for having a preference for their pizzas, from a place that encourage customers to HAVE A PREFERENCE... then you should have opted to make the dough and not talk to people at all.   My friend and I enjoyed the weather so we decided to sit outside and chat a bit because it was getting loud inside with the lunch rush. As I was checking out I realized that a few of the people working in the oven area cared more about having a conversation then actually trying to get orders out. Again, I waved it off and enjoyed the outside weather and pizza. I ate the White Top side and noticed there were a few burned spots, but nothing that caused me any concern. I get the other half home to have later in the evening....but behold, it's burnt. So that's half of a pizza now in the trash because some individuals didn't want to take their weekend job seriously.   I love Blaze, so while I haven't counted them out completely... It will be a long while before I try this location again!",

    "text": "My son could hardly wait to try this place and create his own pizza.  It was really crowded which gave us plenty of time to marinate over the toppings/sauce/crust.  He decided on a basic sausage, bacon pizza.  I had the pesto mixed with red sauce base with bacon, mushrooms, sausage and a pesto drizzle on top.  We both loved the thin crust and the pizza was flavorful and was pretty good overall.  I think this location is pretty new so it tends to be busy no matter the time, but the line moves along quickly.  The pizza is reasonably priced and they offer a few different types of salad as well and the drinks seemed to be really popular.",

    "text": "This is my second experience at a pizza restaurant like Blaze with the whole \"three minute pizza\" shtick. My first experience was in DC and I loved it, but I gotta say, this was even better.   I was able to try a bunch of things my first time at Blaze! Going through the line to select your ingredients for your pizza, they've got everything laid out nice and neat and labeled so you're not holding up the line while you're going through. Big help!  I got a side Caesar and the meat lovers pizza with spinach. They have like four different types of salads and they actually all looked really good. The Caesar was delicious! The dressing was perfect and the lettuce was crisp AF. Don't sleep on the side Caesar.   The meat lovers pizza after coming out of the oven looked GREAT. Very pretty and taster just as good as it looked! The crust was crunchy on the outside and the meatball and pepperoni were spot on. You'd never know it was cooked in three minutes.  A couple other things to note: the service was top notch and the lemonades were DELICIOUS. Very happy people working as far as I could tell and there were four different lemonades - the blood orange was my favorite.   If you're looking for a quick pizza and want something a little different from traditional places, I'd say this is a great place to try!",

So loud  inside with echos that I did not dine in, not how I wanted to spend my lunch hour. The employees were friendly and explained the concept of building the pizzas before I ordered. $8.50 I modified one of their original pizzas.  Many toppings to choose from.  Hot out the oven, ingredients fresh, crust a little too thin for my taste (you could fold the whole pizza over easily), little greasy. Requested water for my drink...here we go with the baby cups for water...geesh.  Just because I want water doesn't mean I will drink a toddler portion, I'm still an adult. Good enough to return but not my first choice.  Same price for more food at local pizza shop.",

This spot should do great being so close to university.  This little section of the shopping center should honestly have some bus parking.  So close to the interstate and so many choices right there.  Onto the food.  I've not been liking red sauces as of recent, something to do with the acidity.  So, pesto or white sauce was my way to go.  I love the roasted red peppers, the garlic, and the spinach, have gotten that on almost every pie I've ever tried from them.  Fresh arugula on the finish as well.  Always good, always tasty.  There was a table beside us with a crowd that wasn't really very pleasant to my crowd or some others, but they looked pretty serious about wanting to fight.  This has nothing to do with the business per say, but they might want to think about a security person after 8pm, especially on the Friday and Saturday night crowds.  JMHO.",

    "text": "I think I have told people about this place at least 6 times since I attended the Yelp event on Tuesday. When I first heard 'build your own pizza' I couldn't contain my eye roll imagining it would be like a subway of pizza shops- generic and underwhelming, but Blaze is anything but generic.   I had the gluten free pizza crust which was actually tasty, not like the cardboard you get at some other pizza joints. The staff was super accommodating and even offered to change their gloves to avoid gluten contamination, wow that is what I call service. This place has several different sauce bases to choose from including a pesto and several marinaras. The toppings all looked amazingly fresh including an assortment of cheeses (goat, gorgonzola, mozzarella, and many more).   I had the pesto base with gorgonzola and goat cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, grilled onions, roasted red peppers, and oregano. The pizza was divine in terms of the quality of toppings. I do wish the crust would have gotten a bit more well done - but maybe the gluten free crust doesn't crisp up as much as the regular crust.   Also, had the arugula side salad with berries and cheese. The salad was good, but the staff was a bit heavy handed on the balsamic reduction, so if you don't like super sweet salad as for the reduction on the side. Over all though I was impressed with this place and will definitely be back soon!   Pro-tip: if you come at sunset bring your sunglasses because you will be blinded by the sun as the place doesn't have any blinds to keep out the bright rays.",

My latest discovery is salami and brussel sprouts (with spicy sauce) - surprisingly killer combo! The blood orange lemonade here is sooo good too.  So when my wife went to sit down outside and 1/2 her pizza slid onto her and the rest hit the floor. I told one of the young men working there.

I feel so confident leaving here knowing that my food wasn't dropped on the floor (at least not after the heat had killed the germs)!   I have visited countless times and staff always seems laid-back and patient. One time my pizza was left in a tad too long and burned a little on one side. I was asked if I wanted it to be made again. They made a fresh one and offered the half burnt one to me as well (why let the unburnt side go to waste!) + a drink.

    "text": "Late post from Grand Opening Day - present time.  I dropped by because I saw a long line. Because I'm bossy especially when I see many people in line of a restaurant AND it's pizza - I'm going to ask questions.   Free Pie did you say? I'll wait.... in the line for 2hrs and 30min. for some darn good FRESH firefrilled pizza - for free! I am certainly overdressed, as I'd just left work and wore heels on this lucky day. But I stood anyway because I met some new friends while waiting. The owners also hung out and gave away free coupons for those who missed the closing hours. It was worth the wait.  I'd steer clear of the balsamic drizzle and always get the \"blood orange lemonade.\"  Since it's opening I've been back several times and brought my family there too. This spot is pizza customization at its finest. My on,y issue was my pizza was not cooked well. Each visit, I let my pizza fire blaze for an extra minute or two.   The ratings alone are for my overall experience on most occasions; however, I had one terrible encounter which I'm hoping the person is no longer employed at this location until diversity training has been confirmed.   I was pregnant and craved Blaze. When we arrived I took a restroom break. Meanwhile, husband ordered our meal. While waiting, he stepped outside to take a smoke break - I know, I hate he smokes too, yet he does anyway. Digressing, the young lady notified him of an alleged smoking area; unfortunately, there was no signage or designated area.  Long story short, she insist on forcing him to leave and he then explained he's grabbing our food to go so the smoke break should be short, especially if she'd spent her energy completing our order vs spending time forcing an argument. (Couldn't disagree here.)  Mind you, I was in the restroom for roughly 15 minutes max. Fortunately, when I came out, food was ready to go and other employees apologized for her disruptive behavior. I didn't know why until my husband and I got in the car. I'm glad I missed the drama because preggo and hungry don't mix well.   Fast forward, the customer service has not been as bad as the previous encounter, but it certainly isn't nearly as good as the first few days. Management should consider revisiting customer service focused discussions. Poor service engagement and lack of concern for quality pizza is starting to spill into ratings.",

I enjoyed my pizza, which I was able to modify any way I wanted. I had a half pizza and salad combo. I love the concept (think of a Subway ordering process) and at this location, the execution was great! There were interesting sodas and juice choices, too.  Crust and sauce and toppings are solid, not quite 5 star pizza, but we will return!",

I called their number to place an order at the University location and they direct me to their website. I go to their website to place the order, get all the way through to adding to my cart and it says the store is too busy to take the order. I change to their Concord location a few miles away the order processes fine. I get a call when halfway to the Concord store saying they don't have the keto crust but it is in the University location. I decide to drive to the university location to place the order in person and Wouldn't you know when I get to that store University they are out of that crust.  A waste of time and gas!  I hate wasting my money when trying to spend my money.  If I could rate lower I would!",

There was a gentlemen doing side work as I entered. He greeted me and asked me to give him just a moment and he would be with me. Upon finishing his duties he came up to me and asked what I would like to order. I politely asked him if he could wash his hands as he just finished cleaning and I don't want him touching my food. He quickly washed his hands and put on gloves. The only con I have is that I have to constantly mention basic cleanliness procedures to these workers. I do understand they're young, but they need to have more intensive training on the health hazards and precautions when handling food. The young man prepared me a fresh piece of crust and proceeded to make my pizza. He was very polite. I wish I knew his name. The gentleman that work at this location always have a great attitude. The females, outside of one black female, always have very snooty attitudes. I'm not sure why, but they are very rude almost as though they are doing us a favor by preparing our pizza. Thank you for being vegan inclusive.",

Update: 7/13/2018  I went back and got another pizza. Total 180 from my last experience! The pizza was not slimy or sloppy. It was great. I added the seasonal broccoli as a topping and it was great.

Have been looking forward to this place finally opening since hearing about it. The area has several other pizza options in proximity however this is the a much different concept than traditional pizza. The Build your own $7.95 option allows to use unlimited toppings. You also have the option of the standard thin, a rising crust or gluten free.   Two things I would do differently: Avoid the balsamic drizzle as it was quite strong and took over the flavor of some of the pizza.  Get a drink. I opted for water but saw several delicious looking lemonade and juice options.",

We were desperately lacking fast casual restaurants and Blaze definitely delivers in that category. If you have never been to a Blaze, it is a Subway style restaurant. You choose your dough, sauce, cheese, meat, toppings, and seasoning to make your own Pizza. Now, they have some standard pizzas you can order that are pretty great but nothing is better than making your very own artistic creation of ooey-gooey goodness. The great thing about Blaze is that all their ingredients are fresh, locally sourced when possible, and free of preservatives. Also, they have phenomenal salads with seasonal and fresh ingredients! They offer desserts like brownies and s'more cookies. All fast fired in 90 seconds in their pizza oven, which you get to see! Try their homemade aqua frescas, they are so refreshing! This location also offers LOCAL brews on tap! Who doesn't love beer with their pizza?! Also, I love that the staff here are so pleasant, generous, and kind.

When I asked to add drizzle, she rolled her eyes at me, added the drizzle, and then shoved my pizza into a box without saying a word. I could hear an employee ask what everyone's problem was to which another employee said \"don't nobody want to be here\". Well, that was pretty evident. The whole ordering experience was awkward and incredibly off putting. I'll buy an $8 pizza somewhere else where I won't have to inconvenience workers who clearly don't want to be there.

The \"Build Your Own\" bar works perfectly for the amount t of people coming in the door. The service was wonderful. I'll definitely be a repeat customer.",

There are a ton of ways to personalize your pizza and so far the staff has been outstanding. Even after visiting once, the young lady at the register who's name I am forgetting, recognized me the next time and called me by name. My wife and I partake in a blaze pizza at least once per week and ordering online to pickup and skip the line is the best thing since sliced bread.",

The different flavored lemonades where excellent. I like that  they have gluten free options. The line waa long but it moved very quick. Their concept of \" fast food\" pizza works well for them and they make it look simple.",

The servers were very stingy with the toppings. I had to ask for more topping on everything on my pizza. The server said that customers are always asking for more. As for the pizza, it was ready in less than 5 minutes. However, it was ok. Nothing special. It's not something that I will be telling all my friends about.",

We have gone 3 times now and laugh about having to pace ourselves so we don't get burned out but this food is addictive!!!!  They are almost always busy, but are VERY efficient at getting you in and eating!  I love being able to have my pizza made EXACTLY as I want it.  Choose the toppings, and how much of each, walk down the line and watch your pizza cook in just 3 minutes.  Amazing and delicious!!!!   The staff, for the most part, appear to be college students and have a great attitude.  You are treated like old friends and the smiles and jokes go a long way toward making you want to go back again and again.  We are hooked!!!",
