    "text": "Hard 2. This restaurant had not one but multiple poor things happen after another.   Do they have high chairs? Nope. Weird, especially if someone tries to bring out a quiet kid early on a weeknight.  I came here on an off night and the service was pretty poor and slow. Ordered over $100 of (what should have been) sashimi, but realized two minutes later I never specified whether or not it was sashimi or nigiri. The waiter never asked, and when I tracked him down and asked if they could make anything remaining sashimi, he said they made all of them. All of them? That would have made more sense if it didn't take another 20+ minutes for the plate of nigiri.   I'd say generally the additional sushi rolls were pretty good. The nigiri, which we picked off the balls of rice, were at best average. Fatty tuna was expensive and exceptionally mediocre. Scallops were very good (my favorite thing), uni was above average, but was otherwise pretty damn disappointed. Our waiter also disappeared for 25+ minutes and I had to go track him down for the check. I can appreciate the place getting busy, but the wait was absolutely unacceptable.  I'd recommend going to O-Ku and spend the extra two minute walk to Sycamore. The two places are similarly priced but O-Ku had a significantly better menu, much better service, and a better quality of food.",

Great specials - we tried some of their summer specials, including a ceviche with truffle oil that was amazing! 3. Friendly service - server was authentic, quick and personable.   Lows: 1. Expensive drinks - wine and sake options started at $11 and went up. I'm ok with paying premium for drinks but seems excessive.  2. Upsell - when we asked for recommendations, it was consistently the most expensive items on the menu.   Overall this is another good option for the are and always glad to have more high-quality asian places in the South End!",

There is a small patio with high tops beside the dedicated off street parking. The restaurant is a mix of tables and booths. There is a big bar and also a separate Sushi bar. The bar is a full service bar with a great selection of liqueur, beer and wine. The wines are reasonably priced and the selection of wines by the glass is decent. The menu is extensive but luckily we had a great bartender who made recommendations; we tasted a wide selection from the menu and everything was very tasty. The tuna tacos are probably the best in Charlotte; they just them totally right. You could probably spend all night on the appetizers only, but try the sushi!  We were looked after by Gus - a credit to any bar or restaurant!  *** We've been back many times now, so we're almost regulars; I'm going to say Gus is one of the best bartenders in Charlotte.

We also have been to O-Ku and Ru San's but agreed that this has been our favorite place (for dinner) to get sushi. Drinks pictured are their mojito and their lychee cosmo.

    "text": "For a new-ish restaurant, Yamazaru has hit the ground running and had me already planning our next visit as we left.  I went with a Hop Drop & Roll, which came from a can rather than a draft, but it was fine and very cold which made it perfect.  My wife got a Cucumber Basil cocktail, which she said was a little sweet but otherwise tasty.  For our appetizer, we tried the Tiger Shrimp.  What we expected: shrimp with some sort of mild dipping sauce and some inedible vegetation garnish.  What we got: eight large perfectly-cooked shrimp, in a relish/sauce that was truly surprisingly spicy and contained cucumber, avocado, onion, and some other indistinguishable but delicious ingredients.  They also came with four rice cakes which allowed us to make sort of open-face shrimp tacos, which were delicious.  This appetizer was really amazing, and it had us excited for what was to come.  The main haul for the evening included the following:  Tofu avocado roll Spicy salmon roll Philly roll UFO roll Rainbow roll Uni nigiri Salmon nigiri  We came hungry and ate it all.  I will spare the details of what each roll contained as it's readily available online, but suffice to say each roll was excellent.  I can only speculate the philly roll was good, since I don't \"roll\" with cream cheese in my sushi, but my wife enjoyed it very much.  A few highlights:  The tuna and salmon on the Rainbow roll were very good, but the yellowtail was a special cut of fish that night.  It had a subtle, clean sweetness that I'd never experienced before.  I really enjoyed that.  I'd seen the UFO roll mentioned here on Yelp before and decided to try it.  I'm normally not a huge fan of tempura fried sushi rolls, but I'd order this again in a heartbeat.  The varying contrasts and flavors along the sauces drizzled over each piece were really delicious.  My favorite bite of the night had to be the uni.  You know how avocado is sometimes referred to as \"nature's butter\"?  Well, after popping the uni into my mouth, my first thought was that uni is the \"butter from the sea\".  It is so creamy, rich, and briny, it just tastes like something Aquaman would make to impress a date.  It's not cheap at $4/piece, but it was well worth it and I won't be able to come back here without getting at least one.  Service was impeccable, decor was pleasant, and the food was killer.  I'm happy to say that the next time we're feeling sushi, we won't have to think about where we're going to go.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite sushi spot in Charlotte, NO DOUBT! My boodle and I went last night for a little date night. We had not been to Yamazaru yet, and I'm so glad we tried it. I must admit, I'm not a super adventurous sushi eater, and I ordered the Philly and the Spicy Tuna Roll. Boodle, on the other hand, went ham on his rolls and said they were fabulous.  Anyway, I absolutely LOVED what I got and it was not expensive. I also ordered a Lemon Drop Martini. Our total bill, pre-tip, was $47 and included 4 rolls and and two alcoholic bevs (one being a cocktail); I thought this was a good price compared to what we've paid at other places.  Our service was awesome. Parking here is a breeze. The atmosphere is trendy, warm, and inviting. We will definitely be back ASAP!!!!",

    "text": "With a lack of good sushi in charlotte, yamazaru has been a go to since they have opened. The sushi is affordable and fresh, and I normally have a great experience. That being said, it's unfortunate that my last experience will probably deter me from returning. I had dinner and drinks there the other night and afterwards was feeling like it wouldn't be safe to drive and I would just carpool with my friend. After checking the sign in front of my parking spot that said it was for patrons of yamazarus address I assumed it safe and smart to leave my car there. When I returned in the morning I found that my car had been towed. I read and reread both signs at the parking lot, neither of which said no overnight parking. I was devastated to find out that my safe decision turned into a $300 fee and a half day of missed work to get my car back. When I respectfully private messaged the restaurant asking why this happened to me and if there was any way to be compensated, the owner denied any sort of responsibility and didn't show any sign of sympathy or apology that this had happened to me after parking in their approved parking and spending money at their establishment. I understand that parking in charlotte is limited and there are rules and restrictions, but the signs in the parking lot should list that no overnight parking is allowed and an establishment that sells alcohol and has drink specials should be supportive of safe driving and not expect their patrons to drink and drive. The response from the owner was extremely disappointing because I would have understood if they would have expressed an apology for this happening and maybe urged the owner of the parking lot to either advertise they don't allow overnight parking or fought to allow overnight parking for guests because they sell alcohol. It was sad that an enjoyable night turned into a huge dent in my wallet after making a responsible and considerate decision.",

Had to collect my socks from the parking lot because Yamazaru BLEW MY SOCKS OFF! Four rolls and two alcoholic beverages later, we escaped for under $50. Pretty impressive.   It was recommended to me to get the UFO and the Kiss Of Fire because, if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that if I'm not sweating, I'm not enjoying my meal. Let me tell you, Yelp audience - there are places that are fantastic and expensive, there are places that are good and inexpensive - Yamazaru takes the fantastic and the inexpensive and rolls it directly into your sushi roll. Cannot wait to go back, and I will bring an extra pair of socks this time.",

Unlike the hipster restaurants that slim their menu down to just a dozen options or so, Yamazaru boldly offers a great selection of appetizers, sushi, noodles, and more. My coworkers have said good things about the rolls they've ordered, but my personal favorites are the una don (unagi over rice) and tonkatsu ramen. The una don is a delicious and filling alternative to the fancier rolls, while the quality of the ramen noodles here is the best I've had in Charlotte (mmhmm I'm looking at you, Futo Buta, and your over cooked noodles).  It's a shame they're only open for dinner, but even then their prices are reasonable for a Japanese restaurant. They're definitely packed during peak hours, but Sycamore Brewing is right around the corner, so it's not the end of the world to put your name down and grab a beer in the meantime.",

So we were seated in a 4 person booth and had already ordered our food when our waiter (maybe he was the manger since he wasn't wearing the uniform) came over and asked us to move table. There was another table in the back that seat 2 people and apparently there was a bigger party behind us that had more people and were waiting. While I understand that they would want to be more efficient with seating as many parties as possible it still came off really rude to make us move tables while we've been seating there for at least 10 minutes already.   For appetizer we got the tako yaki balls which were pretty good. The Cali sunset roll was average. Nothing too special. My friend got the tonkotsu ramen and it was not good at all. It was one of the worst ramen I've had and I've had a lot. Maybe it was an off day since everyone is raving how good the ramen was but I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.",

Parking- There is a parking lot beside it so don't let South End parking scare you away!  Service- Service was spot on. We sat outside and our waiter was super attentive.  Drinks- They had a big drink list but we just got Sapporos  Food- We started with Edamame. Nicely salted and perfect pre-dinner portion. For rolls we got the Spicy Tuna roll, the UFO roll, and the Yamazaru roll. All three were delicious. Super fresh tasting. The winner by a land slide was the Yamazaru Roll. The flavors in it were insanely amazing! Everyone around us was eating Ramen and it looked soooo good!  Value- This is where Yamazaru takes the cake. The sushi prices are absolutely fantastic. Most rolls were under $10! Our total bill was incredibly reasonable!  Absolutely will return!",

That's saying something as Charlotte's not known for its sushi. They prepared the fried rice well here also. The SERVICE however is NO WHERE near as good as the level of service experienced at O-Ku, but the prices are cheaper, so I guess you get what you pay for (shrug). Matt at the bar is pretty nice and helpful. Gus is excellent when it comes to the technician side of bartending, but he could stand to be nicer to the patrons. Matt offered me water 15 minutes after I sat down at the bar as he noticed Gus never asked me if I wanted anything to drink. My drink later spilled, and Gus didn't even refill the glass (shrug). He just looked at me like he was annoyed and went to helping the other patrons. On top of that Gus charged me for the wrong order AND had to void my transaction then recharge me for the correct order. I got my food nearly 45 minutes after ordering (smh). Usually, when a place messes up your order they offer to do something nice for you, not here (shrug). They don't live up to the service expectations of a 4 rated sushi restaurant, so don't come here expecting that. The sushi itself is solid for the price, but there's plenty of room for improvement when it comes to Yamazaru.",

We sat next to two couples who were living their best lives ordering appetizers and round after round of beers. I want to be a classy middle aged Japanese woman when I grow up asking for kewpie mayo to dip my chicken wings. The Brussels sprouts we saw go by smelled amazing! We shared the calamari app and two of us. Calamari wasn't chewy and the sushi tasted fresh. Plenty of food to share between the two of us. Bill came to about $30 before top. Why the 3 stars? Well, I would say they were ok, I wouldn't hurry back but I wouldn't decline an invitation to come here. The service was quick but did not add anything to the experience. I would say just like Ru San, it's short and fast without any extras. Is it bad I would like to be suggested an item and maybe upsold an extra appetizer?",

We started out with the tartar which I have never had before but my boyfriend insisted I try something new. It was SO good. The flavors were there and the chips which were made from some type of root, were great! Moving on to dinner, I was so overwhelmed I had no idea what I wanted. Asked for some help and got several different choices. I ended up getting the Dancing Eel and New Moon rolls. If I had more room in my stomach I would have eaten more. Hands down the best restaurant I've been to in a long while. Not only is the food delicious, but the service is outstanding not just from Gus, but everyone who walked by. Gus was very good to us and we will definitely be returning to try more!",

    "text": "Yamazaru is one of the rare Charlotte restaurants that is still packed at 9:30 or 10 at night, often with people waiting at the door to get in.  Perhaps this is because it is one of the more reasonably priced Japanese restaurants in town, or within an easy walk of all the South End apartments and in the trendy former industrial area just west of the Lynx tracks and south of Tremont. The food here is not fantastic, but it is very good.  It's fairly consistent and the flavors are pretty authentic.  A bar runs down the right side of the restaurant with two TVs, one for the Japanese NHK station and one for sports or whatever.  The sushi bar is on the back left side of the restaurant.  Booths run down the center and tables surround.  There's also limited patio seating for tete-a-tete dining.  One drawback to Yamazaru is that the sushi chefs (and I believe there were 3 or 4) cannot keep up with the sushi orders.  If you arrive early in the evening, you're ok.  But if you arrive after 8pm, the sushi orders get bogged down.  If you order sushi and your companions order other food, they'll be long done with theirs before you get your sushi.  They can't really add any more chefs to that small sushi prep area.  So just plan on staying a while and being hungry as you watch your friends eat!  The other downer is that they offer many interesting sakes, but the prices are pretty stiff.  I would love to order a nice chilled Junmai Ginjo, but a 3 oz serving is $15 and I'd want more than 3 oz!",

My boyfriend and I ordered food Togo since we live in the neighborhood, and when we arrived home to eat dinner which was suppose to be spicy mayo free, it turned out to be covered in spicy mayo. That was our first visit there, the second visit was just the same... my only recommendation to the Restuarant would be to hire a bartender who is fluent in English... sadly I do not believe I will return, although it is fortunate for my bank account since my diet is made up of miso soup and sushi.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I call this place fancy Ru San's! We've really enjoyed making it part of our sushi rotation. We've been a few times, but I still feel we have only ordered a very small segment of the menu.   This restaurant is done by the same people as Ru San's and the menu has some familiar items on it, such as the Crispy Tuna. We usually stop by in search of the Zootopia roll. It was a special roll at Ru San's for a while but they discontinued it. It's so good. It is salmon, asparagus, cream cheese and then deep fried! We also love the Southend roll, which is light, lemony and fresh!  I think the atmosphere is great. It's \"trendy\" and nice but not \"fancy.\" We have always had good and attentive service.   If you are a sushi fan, I recommend giving this place a try!",

The bartender I had was not very helpful with the menu. They didn't know the specials and couldn't help make any suggestions for my first time being there. I do have to say that once they found somebody who knew the menu and told me the sushi special for the day that's what I got. It was delicious. My girlfriend loves the noodle dish with chicken she gets it with broccoli and onions. Overall, I like the food and the service was so so. The speed of the to go order was pretty slow considering it wasn't super busy in there. I would go back and try to dine in next time. I can't forget to leave out I liked how the host open the door and even pulled out my chair for me at the bar.",

    "text": "I think I may have eaten at a different place than what I have seen reviewed.  The service was absolutely 4+ stars as they were attentive and took orders quickly.  1.  The seaweed salad was fairly impressive and had a little heat which was a decent surprise and gave us hope for the dinner 2.  The gyozas were obviously not previously frozen however WOW ginger. I am thinking there was pork in the dumplings with that ginger.  3.  Forget the rest.      A. Way too much mayo on the tempura rolls. Why? It is shrimp that should be delicate while fried but it was smothered.      B. Kalbi should be a marinated korean beef. Kalbi roll was so sadly bland. Beef itself should have some flavor but this beef had flavor of none surrounded by rice.      C. Tuna bomb. The rice cakes were perfectly crispy. The tuna on top? So incredibly under seasoned it didn't taste like anything. It was something quite mushy on top of a very crispy rice cake which had zero salt on it as well.     D. Hamachi kama. HUGE serving of tuna cheek. Grilled on the bone and a great cut of fish. Zero seasoning and no marinade. It honestly had great consistancy but was so bland it had the flavor of tuna from a can.     E. Steam buns. Oh how I love pork. Grilled, fried, boiled, smoked. PORK. The steam buns had slivers of a basic bacon which may or not have been fine by themselves but were smothered in a sweet sauce. Futo Buta up the light rail can show you how pork belly should be served.   Again. I think I went to a different restaurant than the ones reviewed. After dinner we walked to Sycamore Brewery next door and saw the food trucks and realized our mistake. I am sure we would have found something with flavor on our south end adventure had we know the trucks were within walking distance.",

Our bartender was awesome, not only did he make us very good drinks--I had some mules and my wife had the gin berries, but he even was multitasking handling all his customers and training a new bartender as well. We got a few rolls, the zoothopia, Tarzan, and a basic sweet potato roll. It may have been a mistake on our part to get so many rolls with a creamy element to them with avocado/creamcheese, but it also just seemed like they all were doused in spicy mayo and eel sauce, so much so that we wiped it off of pieces.

The new (female) bartender put all our drinks on 1 check and then when we wanted to close out, told us they couldn't do split checks. I'm not sure what century POS system they have, but in my former life i worked in restaurants for 10 year and managed 3 and know there is always a capability to split checks. Additionally, as a regular of the other location, i know they are able to split checks so would be surprised to learn that this location is using a different system. As much as I like the food and the fact that they have a full service bar, I will not go back to this restaurant. I didn't ask for our checks to be on 1 tab so the bartender should not have done so. It was a pain in the a** for everyone to Venmo me money to cover their portion and due to this minor detail, I'm done with this place.",

I only had to wait a minute or two before a polite server came and took my drink order. The drink menu had a good selection of local and import beer as well as various sakes. For tonight I stuck with a local wheat beer on tap.   To start with I had a jalapeno and yellowtail sashimi appetizer. Was very good (pictured). Next zinged two pieces of Uni which tasted very fresh.  Next up I had the Tonkatsu Ramen (also pictured) and their \"West Woods\" roll.  All were very good and despite how busy it seemed, I was served quickly.  The ambiance was more on the chic, trendy side with a more modern twist on rustic decorations.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the Charlotte area looking for sushi.",

I love going to authentic Japanese izakayas since the food tends to be more in line with authentic Japanese food, the drink options are great, and the food quantity is fantastic. However this wasn't quite an izakaya that I had in mind. The ramen wasn't bad, the shishito peppers were okay, but the tori (chicken) kaarage and the pork belly bao buns were bad. The chicken kaarage was nothing like actual to kaarage, but actually closer to a chicken nugget. The bao buns themselves we're dry and flat, while the pork belly was overcooked and dry as well. I'm amazed that a southern BBQ joint down the road is capable of making warm, soft, fresh bao buns, but this restaurant was not.  For drinks a friend ordered the plum wine upon my recommendation because I love getting plum wine on the rocks. However at this establishment they write literally mean plum WINE since the add ume shu (plum wine) with white wine. This drink was passed around the table since no one wanted to finish it off because it tasted like cherry cough syrup.   I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of the products and some of the service we received as well. I came in expecting to find a new go to, but was let down.",

I decided to start with miso soup, as I base sushi restaurants on a few things and miso is one of them.  Let me say, it was great! Served in a covered bowl, was piping hot and not too salty or fake miso tasting. As for the sushi I ordered the sushi and sashimi platter, a good way to gage a sushi restaurant.  The platter came with six pieces of sashimi, four pieces of nigiri and a roll, I chose the spicy tuna.  Everything was great!  A definite spot I will return.",

The place is a bit smaller and wait times tend to vary based on party size, so I would recommend it for a small get-together or more casual date night!",

The menu is extensive and we ordered calamari and tofu for appetizers. The calamari for some reason had a sweet sauce on it. The tofu came with grilled onions and jalapenos- was fairly tasty.  For our main meal we had a combination platter with sushi and rolls. It was sumptuous, fresh and tasty. The service was on the slow side. We tried the Sake. - was ok.  The place is a bit cramped, but compensates with the food.",

    "text": "I should have written this review a year ago, but I got lazy. This has become our go to sushi spot. Our order never changes and the bartenders know it by heart. The only variation depends on what we want to drink. The bartenders make excellent cocktails and are always quick to help you when sitting at the bar.  I can't speak for the entire menu, but the beef tataki is an amazing app! Order it without fear.  The Southend roll is amazing! Always fresh, always just spicy enough, and always hard to order just one.   Finally, the nigiri menu is likely going to be my downfall. I could eat a few pieces of the hamachi every day. It is an excellent piece of fish.  Maybe one day I'll be able to speak to other items on the menu. Based on what I see come out if the kitchen, take the chance and try something else out. You won't be disappointed.",

At first we were seated outside right in front of the door, which we asked to move as the door slings open and when people walk by they're hitting our table bc it's sooo close. Once seated inside, we are immediately greeted with water and moments later asked for our order. Because the place was crowded, there were groups who were crowded around our table standing up while they were waiting on their table. That was very annoying/rude to have someone stand over you as you eat. Even our waiter had a hard time getting through to bring our food and other tables. Never saw management or anyone asking us how was everything. It was overly crowded inside especially since there are no seats for guests to wait. Many people waited outside, like we did until our phones texted us that our table was ready. Think that is a good idea considering people are trying to eat. The food was however amazing. The ambience wasn't impressive at all. I would have to think long and hard before coming back again, If i did, It would be to go only.",

This was all just appetizers and yes we ate every bit of it. For entrees we got the tonkatsu ramen, and chirashi. The tonkatsu was amazing. Not to salty or bland. It was just right.

The ramen is not the best ever, but definitely one of the best in Charlotte. I wish the broth had more of a umami feel and more vegetables like shittake mushrooms, nori & I wish the egg was more like a ramen egg instead of a hard boiled one.  Would go again.",

I can definitely tell it's the same owners as Ru Sans because some of my favorite menu items are also served here (kiss of fire roll, grinch roll).  We started with miso soup and gyoza. The miso soup was small but very good. Some in our party felt that the gyoza lacked flavor. We followed with sushi which was great- I like that they have some health \"no rice\" options on the menu. The sushi was comparable if not better to the sushi at ru sans. We had a minor hiccup with the Tarzan roll (the spicy tuna was left off of the top) and the server quickly remediate the situation and brought us an entire new roll.   Overall I was very impressed. This is a great addition to the south end area with good quality food for the price. The service was excellent- especially for a brand new restaurant! Will definitely be back.",

Or even better check this out: jalapenos soaked in vinegar and sake just for their signature mule cocktail.  Great atmosphere, trendy club vibe - and next door is a great brewery to boot!

Not only is the service excellent (but be prepared to wait - they don't take reservations) but the food itself is incredible. The menu is extensive with all kinds of apps - including poke bowls, tempura and other delights along with various ramen choices and an incredible selection of sushi options. I've been here at least 10 times and each time order at least one different sushi roll and have never been disappointed with my choices. The prices are very reasonable as well, surprising for sushi so close to uptown. With Oku nearby and a few other longtime sushi spots not far away, Charlotte's Southend is quickly becoming Sushitown and I couldn't be happier. Go out of your way to try this great spot - you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I'm giving give stars because our visit on a Friday night, during peak hours was pleasant. This is a nice place to come to grab dinner, lunch, or with friends.  They've got a huge bar, a separate sushi bar seating area, a few regular tables and booths, and an outside seating area (felt a little awkward since it's right by the only entrance/exit). We sat outside because inside was so packed. It took a minute for our server to come to us (3 couples were sat out there at the same time), because no one told her they gave her tables, so communication could be a little better. Also for  a Friday night, they could have used a few more servers. Overall the service was good for a busy time.  The food was really good and fresh! We ordered mostly sushi items. For appetizer we had the Tuna tataki.  It was okay, I felt the sear could use a little more flavor, but the fish was fresh, and i enjoyed the spiral radish that came with it. I ordered the Krystal roll that was phenomenal! I think that's the best roll I've ever eaten. It's unique that they have a good variety of rolls without rice! I also had the spicy tuna maki which was delicious as well, I enjoyed that it was actually spicy and the Tuna wasn't skimp like most places.  My husband ordered the UFO which was delicious, and a spicy tuna.   The menu offers a variety of items not just sushi, but from our experience the sushi was on par with my fave Rusans. I judge my sushi visits based on my love for their sushi.  One thing I noticed is that there were several menu items that are identical to Rusans, so maybe the same people own it, which would explain the quality, similar menu, and familiar wait staff faces, just too many coincidences for there not to be a connection. I will definitely come back here, and it's worth riding the light rail on lunch from uptown to here (already planning that lunch day lol).",

We were greeted right away by a young man who took our names and gave us an estimated wait time of 25 mins. We decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited. Granted the bar was packed so it took a while before we got our drinks, but took a look at there impressive cocktail list. From what I saw was mostly made up of customized martinis. Didn't have one, but from they looked tasty! We got two Japanese beers that were on tap. We got sat in about 20 mins and ordered 2 appetizers and 2 sushi rolls. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend this place. The space is a bit small, but good food. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Yummm! Yamazaru has become my go to spot for sushi in Charlotte! They are located in South End (1 minute walk from Sycamore Brewery), so they draw in a younger crowd. There is limited parking and the restaurant is small so they seem to have a difficult time accommodating groups of 6 or more.  The sushi is so good, and in my opinion it's the best value sushi in Charlotte - most rolls are right at $10.00. I also LOVE their fried rice. Our favorite rolls are the West Woods, Dancing with the Stars, and Tarzan. They also have good beer, wine, sake, and cocktail selections.  I've eaten here a handful of times during the week, and each of these times I've been seated immediately and received fast and great service. I've eaten here twice on the weekend, and both times the service has been slow and I've had to wait for a table. It seems they have the weekday dinner rush under control, but on the weekends they seem a little understaffed and overwhelmed. This is the reason I've assigned just 4 stars. Also, on the weekend evenings it is SUPER LOUD in here, so if you're looking for a quiet date night - this isn't your spot on the weekends.",

I assumed this was because we were sitting outside, but based on other reviews, that may not be the case.  I'm docking the star solely based on the service - everything took too long and we had to track down a server multiple times for drink orders.  That being said, the food was outstanding.  We enjoyed the tiger shrimp, chicken lettuce wraps, ahi poke, fatty tuna poke, and several pieces of nigiri.  The fish was generously cut and the seasonings were very tasty.    They also have a nice sake list with flights available.",

We see 4 spots open at the sushi bar (eeek my favorite sushi experiences occur at the sushi bar!) we try to get seated there. The host ushers us away and puts a reserved tag on the seats (it's 9:30pm in Charlotte ... no one was walking through those doors). We were seated pretty promptly after that. So while we didn't get the exact seats we wanted ... we were at least seated quite quickly.   The waiter was kind, but possibly overwhelmed. We ordered a fried rice and it came to the table with no extra plates. It took forever to waive someone over to bring some forks and plates. After what seemed like an extended period of time the sushi came! The waited dropped it off and was about to leave when we kindly asked him to let us know what each roll was. He wasn't totally sure. This seemed sort of odd to all of us. I've never been to a sushi restaurant ordered multiple rolls and then not had the waiter or waitress tell me what's on the plate.   Once we had an idea what each of the rolls were we dug in. The stand out -by far - was the West Woods roll. But to be completely honest, all the rolls, even the old faithful California rolls were spot on!we also ordered the Dancing W/ Star, the Tarzan and the Mango de Tango.  The fried rice was very tasty too. Next time I think I would ask for it with \"low oil\".   We noticed a lot of younger crowds enjoying sake. We did not partake this time, but definitely next time.   We will absolutely be back and look forward to next time!",

The ramen didn't stand out, and the udon noodles had soggy tempura that wasn't even warm. It was clearly fried earlier in the day and just left sitting in the kitchen...The unami bowl was filled to the brim with white rice, but the sauce was just lacking.

    "text": "Omgahhh Yamazaru is literally one of my favorites, if not my top choice for sushi. It is the sister restaurant of Ru San's but for some reason, Yamazaru is way better in my opinion. The ambiance and flow of the restaurant is open and cozy. The decor is beautiful with wood walls and low-lit hanging lights. It's great for cocktails and sushi and has a romantic, nicer-casual vibe for date night or hanging out with friends.   There is a parking lot that is shared with the apartments next door so parking can get tight, but we've never had an issue getting a spot after a few minutes. It's easy to find and worth it. My favorite roll is the Westwood and there was a special called the Jawbreaker that I believe is on the menu permanently that is awesome. Tip: If you sit at the bar, they will give you a crab and cucumber appetizer and you get a show watching the rolls being made!",

    "text": "Such a great find! I've been in charlotte for three years now and have never heard of or found Yamazaru in my search for sushi. I recently moved around the corner from it and decided to try it. Great decision! The service is so quick and and on top of things. The sushi is so so so good and the prices are cheap for sushi. I had the edamame, the ufo roll, and the mochi ice cream.   The edamame, not so good. It was shriveled up as though it was microwaved. The ufo roll- amazing. Flavors and freshness on point. Good portions and price. Mochi was also delicious but I was disappointed as it listed chocolate and mango and when it came out t was 2 strawberry and 1 green tea. Nonetheless, delicious stuff.  We went on a Saturday evening and with a party of two there was no wait even though others were waiting!  The parking seems easy as they have a whole lot for the building but it's the only business open at night, but we chose to walk there on the light rail",

    "text": "I was pretty skeptical of being able to find good sushi in Charlotte due to its... ahem, limited (but growing!) cultural diversity, but I was pleasantly surprised by Yamazaru! Now, the True mark of a quality sushi restaurant comes from its basics: raw fish and rice, and because I already had my reservations on Charlotte's ability to pull of sushi as a whole, I steered clear of nigiri for fear of ruining my overall dining experience with unfulfilled expectations.   However, the items we did order did not disappoint! We ordered the Green Dragon Roll, the UFO Roll, and the Volcano Roll, and it all came out just under $30! Not bad at all for a step up from you standard spicy salmon roll. More importantly, they tasted great!   Added bonus -- it's right along the South End walking trail so you can walk off your sake before you get back in the car! If we're ever in the area again, this will be my go-to sushi spot.",

I would definitely consider the prices at Yamazaru very good for the quality sushi and service.  They don't take reservations and get quite crowded on the weekends.",

We looked around and were surprised  that it was packed considering it was a Wednesday night, but we were lucky enough to get two seats by the sushi bar (Which was what I preferred anyway). We sat down and ordered some drinks with appetizers to give us time to find what we wanted. I ordered a couple pieces of nigiri while Shelby had a sushi roll. We thought the food was good with a few personal dislikes. The tako yaki balls weren't cooked enough and the flavor inside was a bit bland. With the sushi roll, there was a strong butane taste, which didn't sit well on our stomachs. Overall, the service and the vibes of the restaurant is what would bring me back to eat here.",

I have not had as deliciously fresh sushi in many other places as I did today. It was tasty. It was delicious. It was amazing. How many other adjectives would you like me to use??? This one is getting bookmarked and I promise you, you will do so as well. I don't write many Yelp reviews.. .as a matter if fact.m, I don't think I've ever written any, if maybe one. But after this meal, I felt as if it were my duty to share what I experienced here today. PS - as an added bonus, the staff was amazing and off the chain! I already cannot wait to come back.

The ginger salads and fried rice were favorites for the group as well as the combination sushi (nigiri & a special roll) as well as the kiss of fire!! For a group of 5, the waiter was very attentive and suggested so many great options! For the quality of the food, the sushi was very inexpensive and some of the freshest fish I've had in Charlotte!

I would particularly recommend the Kiss of Fire roll--it isn't as spicy as I hoped, but the flavor is amazing. I was trying to cut back on eating out, and then this opened in my neighborhood-- I'm in trouble!",

Gus was the bartender on both nights that I visited. He's friendly and helped with recommendations on food and specialty cocktails. He's an awesome bartender.  They also make their syrups in house.  The sushi is good and fresh!  I also had their crab cake puppy or shall I say puppies because you get three. They were amazing!!  The beef tataki is also good.  I'm not usually a fan of rare meat, but this dish was very flavorful didn't even bother me that the meat was lightly seared.  Great place for after work cocktails and sushi or a date night.",

    "text": "Went here on a Friday night and the place was super busy, so we decided to sit out on the \"patio\". I put that in quotes because it is more like the sidewalk in front of the door with 5 hightop tables. The inside was very nice, and pretty cool setup for a sushi bar.   When other people were out on the patio getting water/drinks or food we got the shaft. Had to wait for over 15 minutes for water to brought out to the table. Then another 15 minutes to get our drinks. Our waiter took our order and was off, didn't see him again for about 45 minutes. At this point I started to get worried that he got lost, not to mention everyone was now gone from the \"patio\" so we were just hanging out on the \"patio\" without anymore water, with empty drinks, no food, and no music of any kind out on the \"patio\" just silence...cotton mouthed silence...  We did get our appetizer about an hour after we placed our order. We ordered the cream cheese dip, but it wasn't exactly what we thought it would be. Turns out cream cheese dip is actually 5 crab rangoon. Not sure why they would call it a dip, but hey it's their restaurant they can call it whatever they would like.   Our food came out about 30 mins after the appetizer. I was not blown away by the rolls, but they weren't bad.   Considering we didn't order anything that was cooked (besides our \"dip\") I feel like the service was a tad on the slow side (note the sarcasm). Not to mention, the waiter told my wife when she asked for more water \"you need to be patient\". Now he said it not in a pleasant it might be a moment kind of way, it came off in more of a hold your damn horses kind of way.  From being seated to eating and getting the check took well over 2 hours.  Overall I think this place could be cool, prices are about the same as other sushi places in the area, maybe a dollar or two cheaper. I would say don't sit out on the \"patio\" dine inside, and hopefully you will get better service, but if you got two and a half hours to kill, give the \"patio\" a shot.  Don't think I will be returning.",

Drinks were good-loved the stoli doli martini, but the transfusion's ingredients sounded good individually but the drink didn't come together. Really enjoyed salmon tacos and lettuce wraps (not enough filling for the lettuce). We had a sample of the homemade ginger beer which was really good. Overall, we were disappointed in the sushi, especially specialty rolls, which were either small in size (south end roll) and/or too much rice and little filling. Atmosphere was ok--our entire party felt Oku is much better in all areas.",

The sushi grade, food quality, personal service and affordable prices make this restaurant stand out from all the rest. Gus, the bartender, is incredible! He's so attentive and makes the most amazing drinks. If you haven't tried his custom creation of ginger beer (used in many of the cocktails), ask for a sample! It will blow you away- so fresh, authentic and with a kick.  Hata-San is (to my understanding) the mastermind and guru behind the whole restaurant's concept. A True master of his craft and frequently found behind the bar &/or greeting customers. The food: Every recommendation from the staff is spot-on. Even if you're not a sushi (raw food) fan, there are plenty of menu options to enjoy. I personally like sashimi and nigiri. The fish selections literally melt in your mouth. As a self proclaimed 'sushi snob', I rate this place as an A+. Not to mention, the prices are so reasonable and not pretentious.  If you're looking for a place for a special night out or a regular neighborhood spot, I highly recommend Yamazaru!",

We ordered the: - Lychee Martini @ $10 - additional lychee sake would have added to the flavor, but it was a great blend and perfect for a breezy night outside - Green Dragon Roll @ $10  - UFO Roll @ $10 - Volcano Roll @ $8  All of the rolls were absolutely delicious!

    "text": "PSA: this is your Yamazaru WAKE UP CALL. I can't believe this place is rated so highly on Yelp because I left this place with buyers remorse.   The sushi tasted like iron/metallic, which said to me that it wasn't kept well and wasn't fresh. I usually gobble up all the sushi on my plate (my favorite food ever!) and this time, I found myself reluctantly eating to the point where I left almost half my meal on the table. Wish I had taken pictures to display how unpalatable the fish was.   This quality failed me so much to the point where I walked over to O-Ku to salvage my love for sushi.",

The atmosphere of the place definitely gives me NYC vibes, if you know what I mean. The place isn't huge and the place does tend to be busy (considering it's location in uptown). There is private parking. That's a huge plus for us since it's not walking distance from where we live.   We ordered the Pork Gyoza, 3 sushi rolls and a cocktail drink. The gyoza is not something to rave about. I would probably try another app the next time I go. The sushi's though...they were ah-mazing. Definitely one of the best sushi spots in CLT. Get the Yamazaru roll! The sauce with the eel is soooo divine. And I mean divine. That could've been my meal alone but I had to share... The cocktail was good too. It was sweet and I like sweet.",

The reason for the 3 stars is that the bartender who took our order tipped himself 10% while getting our order completely wrong. Instead of the salmon oyako don, we got something completely different and didn't realize until we got home. Also, I'm not sure if it's restaurant policy that a 10% tip is baked in regardless, but if you're going to require a mandatory tip even though you're not providing a service (we ordered takeout), at least get our order right.",

We got the soft shell crab roll (can't think of the name right now) and the gladiator roll. Both tasty and filling. You could split a 3rd roll between 2 people or try and eat 2 if you're starving, but 1 with an appetizer is a great choice for a meal that won't leave you feeling stuffed to the brim. I would definitely recommend this place and go again!",

    "text": "I have lately been having an obsession with all things Ahi Tuna. Yamazaru has been on my list for a while as a top sushi spot, along with their Ahi Tuna tacos and poke.  Their cocktails are delicious, and I would especially recommend the jalapeno ginger mule. They make the ginger foam in house and DARE i say it's the best ginger mule in Charlotte?! (Shh...it is!)  The restaurant is always packed because it's small and easy to get to (it's located next to Sycamore Brewing in Southend and you can access it off the Rail trail). The inside with the industrial aesthetic gives me major NYC restaurant nostalgia. I personally love perching up at the bar and watching the bartenders slinging drinks.   Favorite apps: Anything ahi tuna or the seaweed salad...SO GOOD Favorite roll: The Westwoods...easily my favorite on the menu! Favorite drink: Spicy Ginger Mule...it's not too spicy but the aftertaste heat is awesome!  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the staff. Come in knowing everyone is super friendly and the food will be awesome. However, also come in knowing your food might be delayed or there may be a credit card issue or some other communication break down. We often see our food at one bar sitting there for 5-10 minutes before someone goes and brings it to us. I love the place, but they aren't the most organized. However, it doesn't ruin the experience enough not to want to come back.  If you don't mind the delays and you enjoy awesome food and drinks...definitely check them out!",

Had an early-ish dinner on a Wednesday evening and we were lucky to get a booth... by the time we finished eating, the place was packed and the bar was full.  Hosts and servers were nice enough, and there are bus-ers that walk around to make sure empty plates get whisked away to the kitchen for clean up.  Wednesday was $4 Draft Night!  So we definitely took advantage.  Ended up splitting Tuna Tacos as the appetizer and ordering a specialty roll AND a Tonkatzu Curry Rice Bowl.  Everything was delicious and... \"yes\" I did finish EVERYTHING.  I was super hungry and left super full.  There's a sushi bar you can sit at... and also a separate \"bar\" bar you can sit at as well.  Someone was eating by themselves with a laptop at the bar so it's pretty casual... I'm sure that would be frowned upon when the night progressed.  There are also outdoor tables (not too many), but a really cool spot... there was japanese TV playing on the one TV I could see from my seat.  Made for some interesting moments when I would glance up and try to figure out what was going on.",

While I was seated and trying to enjoy my food the customers who were waiting were literally standing over us and yelling. When I asked our waiter if they could do something about this inconvenience, he replied no it's a small establishment and I would have to deal with it! So I could not even enjoy my meal because of the lack of order/organization they had in allowing guests who waited to be seated. It was so crowded the waiters and people delivering the food struggled to get by, this was a serious fire hazard and sanitation issue!

Our server didnt have any knowledge of the fishes or its origin. Every time i'd ask she would keep having to go and ask the chefs. And every time she came back the answer was \"West coast.\" It was funny when i asked her if the Uni was Nama Uni from Japan, she said its sea urchin. LoL  Service was ok, only ordered a couple of nigiri and waited about 20mins, and they were out of half of the exotic fishes. Overall, if you love rolls this is your place. if you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi, look elsewhere.",

Overall I have no complaints with the quality of the food, but my issue is with getting it. Sushi normally takes a fair bit of time to come to the table and I get that, but they take FOREVER here. I could be waiting upwards of 45 minutes to an hour before getting food. There's also the fact that if you order over the phone, they'll put you on hold for 30 minutes with the restaurant ambiance of people eating and the bartenders making drinks in the background. It takes less than a minute to write down a call-in order, even if you're busy.   I had to hang up because my phone died while I was on hold...with a restaurant...on a day in the middle of a work week. Come on...that shouldn't happen... Worth noting too that it's happened more than once, it seems they put callers on a low-priority list when it comes to ordering food. I'm okay with waiting a few minutes or so but after spending enough time for me to actually have my cell phone die on me while holding is absurd. That definitely turns me off from wanting to call after a long day at work to get some great food. Kind of a shame, really.  Foods good though, if you have 2-3 hours to spare for dinner. I recommend the sushi rolls for everyone who loves Japanese cuisine, and the Kiss of Fire is phenomenal. Don't hesitate to try everything, all of their menu items are freaking delicious.",

    "text": "I'm sad to write this but...this place has been progressively getting worse since it opened. The food has become pretty mediocre, the service is so disorganized, the waiters seem to be at the same time lazy and frazzled and its an overall pretty poor experience.   Last night was the last time I will go there:  First, our sushi never arrived. I assumed he hadn't put it on the ticket and we were pretty full after our meal anyway but then I realized that it was delivered to the wrong table and since we weren't checked on the entire meal we weren't able to say that it was missing until we saw it on our bill.   Second, I burned my tongue on Udon that had an over-steamed-microwaved taste. I later started to feel nauseous after a piece of tempura broccoli didn't taste right. When I bit into it it was brown and squishy, totally off. The tempura was so greasy that I ended up getting sick (a few times) when we got home.   Third and most importantly, our bill was $20.57 I tipped to make it $25. I got an email the following morning from my bank saying that a transaction from Yamazaru Sushi & Sake Charlotte for $344.00 had processed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I called my bank and was able to dispute it to be returned within a few days which is fine for me. What makes me mad is that, for some, that error could leave them with $0 in their bank account! That is not a small mistake.   Yamazaru needs to work on their food quality, having a dedicated server to each table who actually introduces themselves and checks on you throughout your meal, food runners who know the table numbers, and most importantly to make sure they run your card for the right table.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is fine... nothing spectacular. Just a standard, modern eatery. Not bad, just nothing fun or fancy like other sushi places in Charlotte. Pretty basic.  Based on the two times I've visited, the service is adequate. The first time was an older guy who clearly had too many tables. We had to constantly get his attention for service. I don't feel this was his fault; they seemed really short staffed for a busy Thursday night. The second time was a very young server that was nice, just clearly very new and inexperienced. No major issues; just minor things like knocking my sake cup over putting dishes down on the table, transactional service, etc. We all have to start somewhere so I'm not holding this against them.  My main issue was the food. I have been to no less than 50 sushi restaurants in my lifetime so far and we felt the quality was subpar. Agedashi tofu should be firm and hold together while eating. Theirs is swimming in sauce so long the coating is puffy and soggy, falling apart as you're eating it. The sushi would be better if they took the time to prepare it correctly. Spicy tuna should be diced, not a mush.  I may be wrong in this particular case, but it's generally been my experience that the meat's quality is not good so it gets pulverized, mixed with flavoring to make it edible, and presented as \"spicy tuna\". Another red flag was the really long strings of sinew in the mush. Spicy tuna does not normally have that..  Tonight, we both felt unwell after about an hour. Not straight up food poisoning, just icky. The only thing we both ate was the two sushi rolls, so I'm pretty sure there may have been a minor issue with the quality. Overall, not the worst place I've been but I've given it two attempts and we won't be back.",

There was one roll which I believe was called Krystal Rainbow. Inside the roll was a weird combo of imitation crab and lettuce. It wrapped in rice paper that you'd typically use for spring rolls. That was a real head scratcher for us. Would not order that again.  We ordered a bunch of other rolls as well but none were memorable. On a positive note, we did not get food poisoning despite the blazing heat outside. Also, service was friendly and prices are very reasonable.",

    "text": "After reading all the raving reviews, I expected a super-nice dining experience here. Sadly, I wasn't too impressed.  The restaurant itself is very small...very narrow layout at that. Just basic wooden decor...nothing fancy or unusual. That itself is no big deal.   Guess the bad impression started and ended with the service...or the lack thereof? First of all, I met up with a fairly big group of girls for an early dinner (reservations made in advance). The long table was ready for us, and the bus boy was there to fill the water (which was lukewarm, not even cold!) and fix the rocky table...but there was no waiter. ??? After at least 15 minutes, we actually had to ask for one. After taking our order, the waiter did not come by even once - at least to my side of the table - to ask if we needed anything. Usually when you dine with a group larger than 6 peeps, the service isn't the greatest. Still, this stood out as being one of the worst group dining service...in that there really wasn't one lol. Of course, they tipped themself 20% since it was a big group. SO undeserved in this case!  As for the food, I ordered one of their Sushi/Maki Rolls, \"West End Roll\", along with a Tonkatsu Ramen. A-Plus for this Maki Roll (Maybe A-Minus, given not super-cool or creative in presentation), but the Ramen was so Blah, I'd give it a D! The Ramen was super-bland, even tasted as if it had been watered down. I didn't even bother drinking much of the broth since it was nearly tasteless. Most Tonkatsu Ramens I've had around town have been delicious (and much spicier), so this was a huge disappointment.  Maybe this was an off night, but it just wasn't that great...any of it. I may go back one day to try another Maki Roll or two, but NEVER their Ramen again.",

    "text": "I showed up at Yamazaru with high hopes, but honestly this was probably one of the most disappointing Japanese meals I've had in a long, long time.  I don't really like giving 1 or 2 stars, but this was just plain bad food for those who are Japanese food snobs like me who live in NYC with access to excellent Japanese food and having just came back from Japan this past holiday.  Service - lots of people standing around and I had to wave people down multiple times to come back and take our order or to get utensils.  They have a lot of people working here and honestly not that many tables to serve.  They were nice, though.  The prices were very reasonable, I'll give them that ($10 a roll, $10 for a bowl of udon) which should have been one of red flags for this place.  For appetizers we had the shishito peppers which came on a skewer for some reason and were more soggy in the sauce than anything.  The takoyaki was a strange texture - almost bready, which isn't supposed to be the case.  The tuna tartare was basically inedible - I took one bite and basically put the rest back.  It was goopy and you could hardly even separate it as it was one giant goop of slimy tuna - absolutely disgusting!  Our entire table barely touched it.  The saving grace was the hamachi which had great flavor and good kick with the thin slice of jalapeno and the ponzu.  For my roll, I ordered the Angry Spider which came luke warm and was hardly bite sized.  The rice texture was awful and the entire roll just didn't really have much flavor that I'm used to in spider rolls.  I ate once piece and that's pretty much it.  For the tempura udon, it came in a shiitake-tasting broth and random vegetables in it.  Udon texture was fine, but the whole thing tasted like instant udon you can buy at the supermarket.  The tempura itself was ok.... the batter itself was mediocre - nothing like you'd get at a legit Japanese place.  The prices reflect quality here.  You can find way better stuff at Baku in Southpark or even O-ku right down the street.",

    "text": "This place is a sushi gem in south end!!! They have such an awesome menu that anyone who likes sushi will have a tough time picking just one roll.   The sushi chefs are all super friendly and knowledgeable, if you're lucky enough to get a seat at the sushi bar. They'll answer questions for you about the different ingredients they use and what goes well with what.   I'm not a fan of rolls that have cream chese or any type of mayonnaise in them so I typically aim for the simpler rolls. But here there are about a half a dozen specialty rolls that meet my \"requirements\" lol. The most recent roll ive enjoyed is their Salmon Madness.  I also typically end up with 2-3 pieces of nigiri The Mrs.  really likes their Mooshoguru (spelling) roll,  but has a tough time finishing it by herself.   Their shoshito peppers are a hit as well.   All of their fish seems to be really well stored and good quality, which makes such a big difference. If you've ever been to a sushi buffet you'll know what I mean.   I just wish they had a bigger space, it not uncommon to get bumped by people making their way through the walkways.   All in all, I love this place and just writing this review makes me want a Salmon Madness Roll! (YUM)",

This place is very cozy and intimate with parking spots in the front which is a relief if you know anything about parking in South End.   We got the lettuce wraps and crab wanton for appetizers. The lettuce wraps were good but somewhat salty. I don't really like PF Chang's like that but they still to me have the best lettuce wraps.   The sushi is definitely the highlight at this restaurant! Yamazaru has some creative names for their sushi's and equally good tasting. I got the angry spider sushi roll with a variety of crab avocado, peppers and green leaf topped with spicy crab  and eel sauce.   In addition, the Philly roll and avocado roll which were equally satisfying. I would come here for the sushi and you won't be disappointed. The wait is a little long to get in and your food as well. Nevertheless, everyone tries to be attentive to your needs.",

I'm new into the sushi game and Yamazaru is definitely one of the better places I've had in Charlotte!  They have a gigantic regular menu selection and I've never been displeased with any of my orders. They've also always got a bunch of special rolls to choose from which I am a big fan of.  The best thing about Yamazaru in my opinion, is the fact that they let us do sake bombs. That was one of our favorite group drinking activities in DC and it's nice to have a place that will allow us to drink a little bit down here too.   Definitely a good Friday night Sake bomb or a date spot! There's usually a wait but they'll take your name down and allow you to roam around for a drink beforehand.  Highly recommended!",

After actually dining here we realized that it may have been because the service is a little on the slow side. That is enough to make me hesitant to come here again. However, they do make up for it with some pretty good sushi. I ordered the tempura philly roll and my boyfriend ordered the spider roll. Both were unique and delicious! They also had more standard rolls for people who are not as adventurous with their sushi.  Overall, the food itself I say is great and reasonably priced. I just wish the service was a little more prompt. But I would be willing to give it a second chancez",

The menu is...extensive: offering Americanized sushi rolls, yakitori, udon, etc.    For my last visit, I ordered the chirashi along with several nigiri. Chirashi was stuffed with a wide variety of sushi. I was pleasantly surprised to find chutoro, saba, and surf clam in my bowl. Their chirashi, at least that night, was incredible value!  They were out of one of the items I wanted and they actually gave me an extra piece of saba!  The nigiri I ordered were also very generous portions. Overall I've had great experiences with Yamazaru and would definitely recommend this place!",

This restaurant is adorable first off, and the atmosphere is perfect. Great for a date night or casual outing with friends!   The restaurant itself is super small, can fit probably under 100 people. However they do try to move quickly enough to keep the flow moving. In the warmer days there is outdoor seating which helps! They open at 5pm everyday and if you get there earlier vs later there isn't a wait.   The food is amazing! We don't prefer the \"real sushi\" we are more of a cooked roll people. So their selection with that was good! Everything I normally do enjoy. The rice bowls were also what we had! The rice is so fresh and so tasty. The flavors in the bowls were so good. I didn't see a bad thing brought out of their kitchen. Great bar menu too!   I truly need to add the service, that's a huge factor. The waiters are SO friendly!! That makes a huge difference too. Everyone that worked there go out of their way. Highly recommend this pl",

I started with the takoyaki which was perfectly crispy outside and creamy inside. I got tako, squid, toro, hamachi, salmon, scallop, mackerel, eel, shrimp, uni, tuna. I also had a nice glass of sake recommended by the bartender. The fish isn't the freshest but considering the prices, it was pretty good.  I wish I had more time to try more of the menu!

We ordered a bunch of sushi, sashimi and some kitchen appetizers. We were given a complimentary spicy mule drink and that made my boyfriends day. We enjoyed it a lot. Would defiantly recommend it and if you sit outside it's lovely. Casual attire is good. Plan to stay a while and eat some good sushi. It's worth the wait. The owners are super nice.

Yamazaru has average pricing for a small sit down sushi restaurants to but the quality is comparable to their restaurants where you pay two to three times as much.   The staff is friendly and checks on you often to ensure you have everything you need, refilling your waters everytime they visit.   The sushi is very fresh and well crafted. They have tons of options to choose from and some of the rolls are very unique. The takeout is easy and quick without sacrificing quality or service.   The restaurant itself is visually appealing and clean. They have a large, fully stocked bar to eat/drink at in addition to the actual sushi bar.   Located right in the heart of South End, it is a great addition to the area.",

My friends love this spot for sushi because it's in the sweet spot between the more expensive, classy O-ku restaurant and the cheaper, wild RuSan's.  I've only been here once as of this writing and I was in the mood for a bowl of ramen. It was simple and solid. For ramen, I personally prefer the higher quality selections at Futo Buta for about the same price. I believe sushi is Yamazaru's specialty so next time I'll order that instead.",

Rusans is great for a huge group. yamazaru is great for small dinner dates/get-togethers. Definitely a must try! I'm not a pork belly fan but their pork belly in their steam bun appetizer and in the ramen is good!! GOOD! Not too thick or thin cut, not too salty, and flavoring is great!   Green curry mussels appetizer is great. Light and refreshing. Curry is NOT thick. And awesome flavoring.   Drinks are great. My favorite is the cucumber basil! So freaking refreshing especially since summer is coming around.   I'm not a ramen expert. BUT...I would say try the Tonkotsu ramen. Only thing I would add is extra spice but that's because I like spicy! Otherwise, it was good. The boiled egg wasn't over cooked. It was medium. That's how I like it! Yum.  I also like their brussel sprouts! I think it's chargrilled? I would ask for it to be crispier but that's how I  would prefer it!   They still have the hamachi kama, the infamous seafood fried rice, and some other Rusans favorites on the menu.   I always feel so welcome and at home. Lots of love to Hata and Eric! They ALWAYS take great care of me and whoever I am bring with rather it's here or Rusans.",

The place was ridiculously packed and we were quoted for an hour wait but it honestly didn't take that long so don't be discouraged when they quote you a long wait time. We ordered a few appetizers. None were that memorable except for the hamachi jalapenos. IT IS A MUST TRY. I was tempted to order a second one but stopped myself. The fish quality here is above average, and I absolutely loved the spicy scallop nigiri and the uni nigiri which were both naturally sweet and creamy. Although, I didn't get a chance to try the signature rolls here, I will give an updated review the next time that I do.",

I wasn't the only person to arrive 15 mins early ~ 5 other parties were waiting as well.  The sushi is average ~ i gave it 5 stars because they have outside seating & the waiter was attentive, knowledgeable & hilarious!!!!!   I started with lemon water (because the water container was cute \\o/) I opted to try the \"Up the Pagoda\" which is 3 \"shots\" of 3 different types of Sake ~ they were good.   I then tried the Jawbreaker (which I thought would've been spicy) NOPE! The sweet crunchiness of the roll stole my heart. I also had the Scorpion roll ~ a basic American roll. The shrimp fried rice was good ~ definitely a serving for 2 people to share.   They had 1 item on the menu that I'm dying to try ~ Octopus ~ but I'll wait until my homegirl gets here so I can have her cheerlead me on. Lol.",

Let me just start by saying that I am obsessed with Ru Sans (kind of in an embarrassing way). We sat down and looked at the sushi selection.. a lot of the rolls shared the same names as ones at Ru Sans.. My boyfriend did some good ol' google research and sure enough, the owner is the same.  Anyhow, we tried two rolls that I hadn't seen on Ru San's menu - the South End roll and the Tarzan - both were delicious!  The South End has thin slices of lemon on top (including the rind), which was wasn't sure about at first but it was AMAZING.  I will definitely order this one again.  Tarzan has avocado on top and cream cheese inside so if you're a fatty like me and you love both of those things, this one is a good pick too.  I will definitely be going back!",

Straying away from sushi and sashimi, some of the other dishes don't quite hit the mark though. I've been pretty happy with the gyoza and the tonkatsu, although the tonkatsu is usually a bit tougher than I'd prefer. The yakisoba and the karaage were both big misses for me, and were bland. The karaage wasn't breaded enough, either, and was oily.   Putting my misgivings about some of the dishes aside, just on the merit of their sushi/sashimi offerings I'm giving them 4 stars. I'm not sure if they've updated their menus, but previously they stated they had both Kanpachi and Madai, but neither are stocked anymore, I believe due to a lack of demand.",

They make homemade ginger beer so its not overly sweet. The ginger comes out strong as does the spiciness.

Sushi is avg at best.  No wasabi between the rice and fish.  Rice is not vinegarette.  Rice is also mushy.  Price is avg, it seems like you get what you paid for.

There are plenty of parking spaces next to the restaurant and on the street. They have a good selection of Izakaya dish (small tapas style).  Some of the highlights: Tako yaki has a good portion of octopus inside it. The Gindara miso is tasty and the Hamachi Kama is huge and meaty. We finished the night with Tonkatsu ramen. The ramen has a good texture and the broth is wonderful. It would have been better if I can add several slices of pork and bean sprouts. I would have given them a five stars if the acoustic of the restaurant is better. It was hard to converse with the person across the table.",

Even with places like O-Ku, Ru Sans, Nikko, and the fabled Helles and Dunkel sushi (oh yea, that's real), I still see so much potential for Yamazaru to lead the pack here.  Saturday evening, about 7:30pm, The Lady and I walked into Yamazaru for our first time, and to our surprise, there were still several tables open and available. The very first thing we noticed, however, is how the two-tops on the patio were filled with people and their dogs. Super good to know. Anyways, we were seated and our server, Phat, came up and greeted us immediately. We ordered a plate of their tiger shrimp appetizer which featured delicious shrimp in a chili sauce, and little rice bowls that you could use to make mini tacos. I'm lucky I even was able to snap a photo before The Lady destroyed them. Together, we ordered 3 sushi rolls, the Angry Spider, a specialty called the Jawbreaker, and the West Woods. Phat told us that the restaurant was unfortunately out of snow crab, the main meat in Jawbreaker, and they were using imitation crab and the price was reduced $3 because of this. The Lady and I agreed that wasn't the best option and ended up choosing New Moon instead, but major props to Phat for even telling us this.  Our wait was long. Probably too long for me to be giving 5 stars, considering the table behind us ordered several things that came out almost immediately, while our 3 rolls took about 45 minutes. But you know why I'm not docking? Because Phat came and checked on us, assured that he was pushing the kitchen, and apologized so many times and said that he would be worried if he were in our positions. I don't know why it took so long, nor do I really care so much. An attentive waiter can make time pass a lot faster.   We see one sushi roll go to the table behind us, and both The Lady and I eye it. Ours should be coming out first. Turns out, the table behind didn't order it, and Phat, as a courtesy, gave that whole roll to us on the house. I don't remember what it was, but it was topped with Tuna and Avacado and the fish was extremely fresh and flavorful. Our three rolls come out, gorgeous presentation. All of the tempura pieces were light and crispy, and not the least bit greasy. We were uber impressed with the price point that came along with it too! 3 rolls + appetizer came out about $42, a fantastic price for sushi for two!  At the end of the night, we knew we'll have to come back. The menu is extensive, but luckily there will always be a table so we can try it all :)",

Prices are very wallet friendly too, especially on the nigiri and traditional rolls like negitoro. I was super happy to find natto maki (fermented soy bean sushi roll), which is hard to come by in the US since it's usually only Japanese people who like it because of the smell. They also have onigiri which is a Japanese comfort food (basically a triangle of rice with a filling and wrapped in seaweed). In addition I tried the black cod which was very good and a fancy cucumber wrapped roll which was fresh and tasty. Service was efficient and the drinks looked good too (large selection of sake and $8 for cocktails). I would definitely come back when in Charlotte again. I liked this place much better than Futobuta and O-ku sushi, which I also tried in the same week.",

They offer a great selection of specialty and traditional sushi rolls, and a wide variety of sashimi!  All are incredibly delish.  Cocktails are great and they have a good selection of local drafts.  For sushi, it isn't a bad price either!",

    "text": "Great spot in Charlotte. Great service and amazing food. The sushi rolls. The appetizers. The sake. All... Yes. Yes. Yes. I will hands down, say that this place has my favorite appetizer in the QC now (fujimori). We had the tuna toro tartar...yes.  The fujimori was obviously amazing since it's now my favorite app in this whole city. Hold on, let me pause, because we started w/ miso soup, & this often gets underwhelmingly noticed; we are very cold natured folks and typically start out every meal with soup, so we comment on every. single. soup.  So, our comment on this miso was....drumroll...fabulous! Enough seaweed and tofu to make one very happy. After the soup, we were still cold, & our wonderful sever (Phat) turned the air up for us. Love! So, back to the food- after the soup, we indulged in the toro, the fujimori, and then the rolls. The Westwood and the Jawbreaker. Both must-haves. The Westwood was awesome...an easy \"yes\".  The Jawbreaker, though. I get it. You break your jaw from it dropping through the floor after tasting the amazing delicacy of this roll. Yummmm.  My fiance doesn't care too much for seared salmon, but this slightly seared scrumptiousness had even him salivating. We sipped on the one hot sake offered on the menu during the whole meal and it was a perfect accompaniment. So, formal review: Service, A+; Food taste/quality/showmanship/etc, A+++;  Atmosphere, A, casual but trendy and slightly loud space (could use some carpet to absorb noise).  Basically, we were already planning what we would order next by the time our bill came & while we were unbuttoning the top button of our pants to finish that meal. Yeah, we'll be back....for the ramen, the Japanese curry, the many other apps we didn't get to, the many other sushi rolls we didn't try, and of course, the sake and the wonderful service.",

I can't even describe what makes it better - it might be the rice. I feel like they are snobs at O-Ku and Yamazaru is a normal spot that is just crushin' it. Perfect for a date, double date, post-Sycamore dinner, or take-out after a long day.",

They have a very extensive menu varying from sushi, ramen, udon, and rice bowls. You can find something for everybody on the menu! They atmosphere has a nice gals night/date night feel. We ordered the salmon rice ball, tako yaki, seafood udon & green mango roll! The salmon rice ball has literally less than a teaspoon of salmon and just consisted of rice. I also didn't enjoy the tako yaki, it was too mushy and doughy inside, I've had better. The seafood udon was good, and so was the green mango roll! Our service was also good, our food came out fast and our server was nice(: Overall I feel like the price reflects the quantity of the food, but I don't think I would find myself necessarily craving anything!",

    "text": "So I found this Japanese restaurant located right beside Sycamore Brewery after indulging in National IPA. The location is perfectly located in the heart of South End around the breweries and other local favorites in the area.   First off, it's perfect that I can walk to restaurant. The staff for the most part got us seated pretty quickly since it was just moderately busy. The decor is ok and the size is a bit on the smaller side, so I can see that being an issue when more people discover this place.   The waitress was pretty nice and professional, knowledgeable to the extent that she was correct.   I ordered the citrus infused sake, some berry martini drink, scallop ceviche, the Caribbean roll (on special), and a couple of other items. It all was delicious! No complaints on the taste of the food and the quality of the seafood.   All in all, I would definitely, and am, going again!  --TrizzyO_o",

We were seated at the sushi bar, which was awesome, because watching them churn out roll after roll was a delight in itself (and helped me pick my roll). The servers were attentive and informative, but in no way rushed you to order or anything. We started with the pork gyoza, which was light yet flavorful, and the ponzu sauce had a light kick to it. My husband ordered the UFO and spicy salmon roll and I ordered the Rich & Famous and spicy tuna roll. All four of these rolls were delicious and very filling! Each had their own unique flavor profiles and my husband couldn't stop raving about his UFO roll (he's still new to eating sushi). This is definitely a place that we will be back to again and again to get our sushi fix!   Bonus - if there is a wait, they will take your number so you can hop over to Sycamore for a pre-dinner beer.",
