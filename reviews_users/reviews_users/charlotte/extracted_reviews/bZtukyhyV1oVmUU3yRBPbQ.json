Their drinks are awesome, their goodies are yummy, and some are gluten free! (Which means I can eat them! xD) They have really slushy ice, which is awesome because it is like snow, and I'm the weird kid who put out a bowl for snow to fall in every year so I could have 'natural' snow cones. The baristas are always friendly, and nice, even if you just want a cup of ice. I will definitely have to make my way over for some caffeine buzz, and free wifi to do my homework. Awesome shop with an even better atmosphere, definitely recommend it!",

They've got all of the markings of the hip coffee shop experience: local artists' work as well as other types of quirky flair on the walls, little multicolored tables and chairs, just-off-mainstream but still pleasant music, thoughtfully planned nook/booth seating so you can sip your drink and work in your own private little world.  On the other hand, they also actually had friendly and helpful service, a welcome break to some previous hipster coffee shop experiences I've had in the past. I had a wonderfully refreshing iced tea and a slice of rich cheesecake, and I noticed that they also offer ice cream, all variety of espresso drinks and vegan treats (if you're into that kind of thing).  I do see how coming by at the wrong time could be a problem, what with the somewhat limited seating options, but I guess that's the price one pays for cozy.",

If you go on a early Saturday or Sunday morning you will be able to enjoy it right out of the oven.

I would love to hang out here with my laptop and do some work but there is one thing that RUINS this place for me...   The coffee is terrible!  I am a bit of a coffee snob so take my review with a grain of salt. I don't drink lattes or frozen drink I like a plain cup of black coffee. I've been here twice and both times it was impossible to finish my cup of coffee because I was so bad. It's so bitter and acidic! I have yet to try a good cup of coffee here. It's comparable to gas station coffee, just a step above.  So go hang out here but don't get a cup of coffee.",

The space is a little tight but theres a great atmosphere here to make up for it and provide such a cozy coffee shop vibe! Outside seeing is available with some quirky art painted on the side of the building and some cute lights strung above the table area. Inside is set up with recycled materials and seemed like a nice place to set up a lap top and sit down and do work, but the weather was way to nice to not enjoy the outdoors and watch people walking to and from the farmers market. Their customer service was great too! If you seem quizzical in trying to make up your mind on what to order they are all there to help you decide! I ordered an iced hazelnut latte but was sad when i found out they don't carry hazelnut and the woman helped me find an even better flavor; toasted coconut! it was delicious and well made and kept me going all day! I am so happy that Noda had this little oasis to stop by that was a good break from brewery tours and pizza shops!",

Cyclists stop by during the morning ride, and people walk their dogs up for a little morning caffeine. The atmosphere is very hipster and cool, but not oppressively so. Sunday mornings (I don't know what other days) they have hot breakfast items- biscuits, burritos and the like which are pretty good.

They roast their own coffee which in general is a plus for a shop. I had a white chocolate mocha and my girlfriend had a dirty chai latte both had great flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves coffee it is worth your time! They also have stand up comedy which is cool but again it very had have 15 people in the place since it is so small.",

The 2 baristas, one male/one female, were both attentive, friendly & helpful in my choosing what to drink...it was my 1st visit there. The price of coffee was shockingly REASONALBE...YES! Smelly Cat was extremely CLEAN and tidy...something that is important to me. If I lived IN NoDa, I bet I'd become a 'regular' at The Cat. It's a good place to know about in that part of town to meet friends and clients, too. I only saw cookies/pastries to eat, but I was there in the evening and was more concerned with cleanliness than food choices (just being honest). I WILL return and use The Cat as a regular meeting place when in NoDa. Only possible 'con' is IF you use artificial sweetener, BRING YOUR OWN, as smelly cats do NOT use artificials...sorry but I have lived well on 'PINK\" now 61 yrs and never treated even ONE patient in 38 yr of ER Medicine who was ill from using 'PINK'. I'll be stashing a few in my car starting now.",

They change their coffee specials daily and they range from Decaf to Dark, and they are all delicious.  I heard the Mango Smoothies are a delicious treat as well.  I gotta try one next time around.    I also thought that the outside seating was well decorated with homemade wind chimes and trees for shade during those hot Charlotte afternoons.  I liked it so much that I should have left a tip at the bar, but I was a little broke.  Woops.",

Stopped in to grab a bacon, egg & cheese and a Kona brew, and left a very happy camper.

Sure, the walls still had ears (and some overpriced artwork), but I actually could sit and think and write. Then about 30 minutes later, one of my friends dropped in and some of the stories she was telling I could tell the MacBook guy was listening quite intently.  While sitting in there, I heard The Decemberists, Temper Trap, and a bunch of other Leanne-approved alternative bands. Definitely an improvement of last time too.

Be it coffee or tea, ice cream, or pastries, they have a little something for everyone.  During warmer months they also live music outside.

Also, there is ample comfortable seating and free wi-fi.  My decaf was pretty good, though slightly less hot than I would like. Regardless, the atmosphere is half of what makes a coffee shop great.

Their coffee is better than most that I've had in the city and their pastries are quite good as well. I've only ever been on the weekends but they get quite a bit of foot traffic here.   The baristas are very nice. It's a relatively standard set up with about 8 tables (three fun little alcoves) and one bar where sometimes people can sit and sometimes they have baristas using the Chemex. It can get crowded when everyone is standing around waiting for their drinks to be ready, but they work quickly. There is also some outdoor seating which is lovely, either on the sidewalk or the side of the building facing the parking lot. They always have music playing and I personally think they have good taste. My only complaint is the tables are a bit small (though admittedly, my laptop is enormous) and the AC is always WAY too high.   I will keep going back because I dig the ambience and the coffee ain't too shabby.",

It's a great place for a coffee date, chilling with friends and to study (FREE wifi, yay). It has both outdoor as well as indoor seating available.

Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat,  It's not your fault   Now, I am going to be 110% honest here, the reason my fiance and I ventured to Smelly Cat is because we just moved to the area and WE LOVE Friends. When we found out there was a coffee shop in town and that's down the road from us named Smelly Cat, it was a no-brainer. So, we jumped on our bikes and the story beings.  WOW! Everyone and their Mom comes here. We visited Smelly Cat on a Sunday and I was nervous with the Farmer's Market next door and a number of dogs that we wouldn't be able to find a place to sit, but we did!   All of their breakfast items are homemade, so if you get there late don't be surprised if that breakfast burrito you wanted is no longer there. Yuuup, that's what happened to us. Our barista pointed us in the right direction and we settled for a breakfast sandy with sausage, egg and cheese. I am pretty sure the biscuit is what made this sandy from meh to yum!   Iced coffee lovers, this is your spot. With four, maybe five, different types of cold brew on draft. I don't see the problem. I went with the New Orleans style cold brew and I should have asked for more information. This was far too sweet for my likening, but now you know.",

Smelly cat had a cozy vibe and amazing coffee. We actually made another trip to Smelly Cat on our second day, as well, to get another coffee (cold brew for the win!). That time we were smart and got some coffee beans to take home with us. I recommend everyone check this place out.",

    "text": "I went to breakfast at Smelly Cat Coffee with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed ourselves. We ordered a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit and a bacon, egg and cheese burrito. The burritos and biscuits are homemade but premade; if you come later in the morning the options may be limited and you made need to ask them to reheat your meal. The biscuit itself was outrageously good. The burrito was not particularly special, although the bacon was cooked nicely.  The coffee menu is extensive and clearly well thought-out. There are hot and cold preparations, as well as pour-over options. You can sample the coffees which helps with decision-making. My white chocolate mocha left much to be desired; it tasted like raspberry for some reason. The mocha flavor is why I docked a star, since it is a coffee shop after all!  Smelly Cat Coffee ROCKS the interior. You walk in and feel immediately transported to the hippest part of Brooklyn (or should I say \"hipsterest\"?). The ceilings are covered in burlap sacks for coffee beans, nooks are formed with reclaimed wood (each has an outlet so that you can utilize their free Wi-Fi), a giant old-school coffee grinder provides an amazing focal point, and the walls are even faux exposed brick. There is a LOT going on but it all works together to provide a clever and cohesive ambience perfect for weekend relaxing, weekday (small) meetings, or even grabbing a quick cup to-go. There is a darling porch area with outdoor seating options. Smelly Cat Coffee is extremely animal friendly.  We will be returning to Smelly Cat Coffee to try some new items. It would be great for a long, yummy Saturday morning with a crossword puzzle.",

Instead of being a bustling center it's more of an area you want to live by so u can WALK to ride a bike to. It's not so much a bar hopping things it's a neighborhood feel. Which I appreciate more than most, it encouraged me to stop there in the first place. When I arrived of course I noticed the fun decor but I also noticed that I was immediately welcomed. The staff went over the menu, at the time it was very hot outside so I decided to get one of their shakes, and one for my mom. She ordered an orange pop one which she said tasted just like the popsicle. My chocolate shake was okay, although it is general added for an extra flair, it had a slight taste of coffee to it. I've never been a big fan of mixing sweet with a stronger coffee tastE. I think it would have been fine without it. But overall a definite stop.",

At about 10 am Sunday morning, it was quite a line to wait to order.   I just got a coffee with almond milk and asked what vegan pastries they offered.   Disappointingly they only had one and it was not a choice I would normally have made, but I got their peanut butter bar anyway.   The young lady who served me identified herself as also vegan, so that made me happy, but spending over $9 for a medium coffee and a small peanut butter bar.   Otherwise, I like the place and might give them another chance when I get back to Charlotte, but I surely wish they would do more vegan pastries.  Matter of fact, how about ALL vegan pastries?!!!",

The inside of the shop feels a little cramped to me, but I am 6,2 so I could just be me. The interior is dim and comfortable, though they lack an of the nice big sofas some other Charlotte coffee shops have. The outside seating is sparse and the view isn't very impressive. There is some sore of \"art?\" garden outside that could be mistaken for trash.  All and all, you can get a good cup of coffee for you and a friend. It's not really the place for groups.

Even black, it had a smooth, velvety creaminess, while still being refreshing and thirst quenching.   I have no idea how they do it.  I've had 24 hour brew. I've had Guatemala (where their current beans were from, I guess).  I've had cold brew that uses that same drip grind size. Nothing NOTHING has been as outstanding as what Smelly Cat puts out.  I'm simply blown away, still, a week later.  Otherwise, cafe space was clean, spacious, cute with mismatching chairs and tables, and a stack of board games. Folks were sitting both inside and out, and (gasp) conversing with each other instead of having their heads stuck in laptops.   The staff were beyond friendly, kind, and helpful in suggesting places to check out in the neighborhood.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I'll be at this place in a heartbeat to try their cortados, shots, and whatever else they can do.",

I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I had a almond milk mocha w/toasted coconut and it was probably the best cup of coffee I have had in quite a while. It was also a little cheaper than Starbucks. I will definately be visiting more often. Fresh Roasted Beans, a Nice Staff, and a Fair Price. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",

I also like that they offer a daily flavored brew as well.  If your ever in the mood for something a little more mellow, but not a heavy as a flavored latte or mocha, a cup of Hazelnut coffee is the way to go.  I also like their strong sense of local-ism.  It is apparent that they want to support and encourage neighboring businesses.  Another major props to Smelly Cat for roasting their own beans.  This is really impressive and makes 36th Street smell AMAZING.    Finally, I really like the atmosphere of Smelly Cat.  They have great outdoor seating (with fresh water for my pup) and a really cozy layout inside.  Smelly Cat welcomes and encourages resting and relaxing over a great cup of coffee, a good book and free wifi!",

We didn't see much in the way of food beyond a few pastries, but I think the coffee makes up for that. I had a cafe au lait, with the dark roast (which I highly recommend). The flavor was robust and fresh, and the milk was scalded and not overly frothed in the cup, which is what one should expect with that order. My partner had a hazelnut latte, which he described as having light, airy foam that he felt was like sipping into a cloud.  The atmosphere was friendly and artsy. We had the choice of sitting inside or outside, and frankly, we did both.  The inside has outlets at every table for customers bringing laptops, and there are a few benches and tables outside as well.  We will definitely return when we come back to Charlotte to see this place develop!",

And believe me, freshly roasted coffee is seriously good. Earthier, smoother, more flavorful.  But the coffee is not the only reason you should visit Smelly Cat. They carry first-rate snacks from premium local bakers, including some incredible gluten free options. I sprang for the gluten free peanut butter brownie and OMFG was it good.  There's also an awesome patio area in the front where you can hipster-watch in NoDa. Those hilarious hipsters, always up to some sort of hullabaloo or haberdashery.  You should go to Smelly Cat for all of these reasons. I look forward to exploring their shop again.",

I had a great first experience there and definitely recommend stopping by if you're ever in the area! It's cozy, quirky and even has outdoor seating.   They have awesome service, and everyone there was so friendly. My friend and I met all the workers on a first name basis and even met Cathy, the owner who is such a sweet lady by the way. They made me feel like I was a regular customer!  There were numerous drinks on the menu but not many pastry choices, which is why I did not give it five stars. By suggestion, I ordered an iced dirty chai in the biggest size they had. It usually comes with four shots of espresso, but I asked for one less shot. I thought it was delicious-- and this is coming from someone who is not so fond of the chai-taste!",

Following most Yelper's recommendation, I tried the hot 'dirty chai' and definitely enjoyed it, although it didn't leave me jumping for joy. It came in a really small cup, maybe 10 ounces ( which is okay with me) Maybe I should try it iced? Not sure.   The restaurant itself is a unique, quirky , funky type of place that would like to park myself in to read a book, do some homework, or write some Yelp reviews.  It's very narrow inside, but they got creative with the seating: single person alcoves along the wall, bar seating at the front window, seating outside in the front, and on the sides of the building. There is even a curvy bar from which I believe at some point in the day they serve beer on tap ( local brewery creations included).   Saturday morning was pretty crowded inside, but I will certainly be making a trip back, maybe when it's not so busy.",

It's a quirky joint in everything from it's name to its interior design, and it attracts all kinds of customers. I think we all have a universal appreciation for the \"Friends\" love.   The coffee is great, they have multiple options to choose from and they have baked goods and breakfast options to enjoy with your drink!   I recommend sticking to the basics: black coffee with a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit sandwich, you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Entered Smelly Cat for the second time in my life the other day (first visit was a group meeting back when I was getting my MBA, and I'm trying to block that craziness from my mind, so this review is only for my most recent visit).   What a wonderful little coffee shop. If I lived in NoDa, I would definitely support this small business instead of hitting up the big chains. The atmosphere is quite cool and laid back, and the staff was beyond wonderful. They had a ton of pastries and what looked like a mouth watering carrot cake, but I was there for one reason, and one reason only...caffeine.  Nicole W (being the fantastic community manager that she is) raved to me about the pour over coffee, so at Yelp's Passport to NoDa event earlier this week, I hightailed it over there to check it out. The wonderful Cathy (what a great name, huh?) walked us through the process of pour over coffee, which creates a very smooth cup o' joe. I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and my caffeine - with some steamed almond milk and honey. Very, very good. If you have the time to wait, I highly recommend checking it out.   And to support the business even further, I purchased a nice little pullover. There are t-shirts, sweatshirts, and other items for sale with the logo and location on them. I love me some quirky little gear.   Head on in to Smelly Cat and sit inside if the weather isn't good, or grab one of the outdoor tables and soak up some vitamin D. Either way, you can feel good about supporting a small business in your area.",

    "text": "First off, I'm fully in support of independent coffee shops. I won't lie: I love Starbucks for its consistency and quality drinks. But sometimes you just need to leave the corporate behind and support local businesses.   I wanted to love Smelly Cat--I really did. (Come on, what's not to love about the name?) And from all the good reviews, I had high expectations. I don't at all consider myself a snob, but it just wasn't my scene. Rustic is nice, but Smelly Cat could have stepped up the decor just a tad.   The coffee house reminded me of a dive bar. That's not a terrible thing though, right? So, my impression was that I'd at least get a reasonably priced drink. However, I was taken back to find out that a small flavored iced latte would cost me $5.  Whoa...I didn't realize that ice cubes were that hot of a commodity in Charlotte. So I immediately backtracked my order and went with a frappe instead. It tasted alright, though it was on the rich side.  I will give Smelly Cat a thumbs up though for its indoor and outdoor seating. There's definitely plenty of space to chill out and enjoy your food and beverages. Oh, and did I mention they sell beer? I didn't try it, but kudos for that.",

The coffee is good, I just had a regular, dark roast coffee and Becky had tea. KIDaween gave each one of The Little Kids a coupon for free ice cream which we redeemed.  The staff was awesome, friendly and professional. The girls at the counter were very nice to the kids and asked about KIDaween.  The set up is quaint and artsy as it should be in NoDa and there's a nice balance of NoDa natives and families filling the tables.  Love the community board (but I have a weird thing for those) and the little outside area.  Definitely will stop by again.",

I love the fact that they roast their own coffee and that there was a coffee roaster in the shop itself.  I decided to try a Vietnamese cold brew coffee out of curiosity since I've never seen that offered anywhere else, and it was delicious and served over crushed ice. My bf got a medium roast coffee and said it was pretty good too.   Friendly barista, cute coffee shop, delicious coffee with CRUSHED ICE--all reasons why I will make a point to come back here whenever I'm in Charlotte next.",

Another flattering review of Smelly Cat seems redundant, but here's my observations about this place  -High \"perk\" factor of baristas-I can't even pull off that level of perkiness with liberal doses of caffeine  -Variety of bevies- Chai lattes, a different flavor of iced tea daily on special, several roast of coffee to choose from.  They keep iced coffee (don't know if its cold press) but it does the trick.    -Dilworth coffee used in coffee beverage-It's \"dil-worthy\" of praise, wha wha whaaa!  -Smallish-Though I wouldn't likely loiter here for hours, I would certainly visit Smelly Cat on a lunch break or before a big day in NoDa (or night, if you know what I mean).  The overall experience is great.  I like light or medium roast coffee and I find it to be a tad bitter here.  It's really good, but it's not as smooth as I've had in other coffeehouses.  Overall, Smelly Cat makes NoDa what it is.",

Artists with a vision of creating a new fringe arts district are off to a good start, opening several shops and restaurants bordering 36th Street and North Davidson. Among those businesses is Smelly Cat, a locally owned coffee shop that aside from coffee, serves sandwiches and other snack items including a uber yummy peanut butter pie.   Small booths are constructed of used doors and the overall decor is rustic with a sprinkling of cat items throughout, there is outdoor seating as well as a small parking lot to the side of the building.  While NoDa is a bit out of the way, it is one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Charlotte and Smelly Cat is a fun addition to this district.  The first and third Friday of each month brings out the free \"Gallery Crawl\", where the galleries stay open late in the evening.",

    "text": "My Experience: Lucky I guess reading other reviews, but I drive right up to a parking space beside the building. However, I can see there could be a problem in parking. Especially, if you are not familiar with this area like me.   This coffee shop is small with inside seating as well as outside seating. It's completely comfortable once you find a seat inside. Outside Seating looks like it would be the place to sit at if the weather is nice and not hot like is right now on this late June day.  They do have WiFi but the password must be given to you at time of checkout. The password is something weird. The cashier wrote it down on a piece of napkin but I couldn't read her hand writing. So I took my IPhone 7 to her and she typed it in for me. She also did my MacBook Air. So, that's great customer service.  How Discovered:  I found this place because I use the Yelp App. I hit directions to take me here but it was wanting me to use a path that included a road closed. I believe it was 36th Street. So, I redirected my Yelp GPS and I finally got here on a Sunday morning just before noon.   Menu item ordered:  I studied the Yelp listing, reviews and photos taken and decided on the toasted coconut frappe with whip cream. It's a cold sweet drink with caffeine that is perfect for this time of year in early Summer.  It was delicious and was so good that it was gone within a few minutes.  Final Thoughts: I really like this coffee shop. Yes, I would come back if in area. A lot of college age students were at this coffee shop while I was here.  Now, there are several colleges and Universities close by and it looks like when the students visit this business when they are not in class. Also, when looking outside down the street the visit other local establishments close by too.",

    "text": "Made a quick stop into Smelly Cat Coffee on Monday afternoon. I went with a Toasted Coconut Frappe.  Quality Smelly Cat Coffee was a necessary last stop before leaving Charlotte. Desperate for a boost of energy, we decided coffee was the answer. Feeling adventurous, I decided to go with a more elaborate Toasted Coconut Frappe. And while I did enjoy the milkshake-like coffee drink, it quickly became too much sweetness for me. Good in a small dose, but definitely something to share. I think I would have opted for a more traditional selection if given another chance.   Quantity My Frappe was very large and maybe a little too much for one person. I ended up handing it off to my girlfriend about two-thirds through.  Value My drink was about $5, which seemed like a decent deal for a specializeed drink.  Ambiance Smelly Cat Coffee is located in the NoDa area of Charlotte. In an area full of live music venues, old school theaters, and rows of little shops and restaurants, the coffee house fits right in. Outside they have plenty of tables and chairs set up to enjoy a beautiful day. Unfortunately the weather was not behaving and with little shelter outside was not an option. So, we ended up inside, which at first felt cramped, but after a short rush, felt more cozy. In terms of decor the shop is busy, with things everywhere, mostly related to coffee. They had a bar near the front, several tables in the center space, and then a few uniquely crafted enclosed tables on each wall. The larger back area was reserved for making and serving coffee. The building felt like it had history in its bones, and while that adds charm, it was frustrating dealing with wall sockets that could not keep a charge and tables that were a little too rickety. In the background alternative rock music crooned over the speakers, which I also believed could use an upgrade.  Crowd The place was busy on Monday afternoon, granted it was a holiday and I'm sure folks needed coffee to get going after a night out. The crowd seemed mixed between folks who had settled in with books, newspapers, and computers, and groups just grabbing coffee to go. It was a younger crowd and I got a very hipster vibe.  Service The girls behind the counter were friendly and quick with drink preparation. Even during a rush, they seemed to have no issue in pushing out drinks fast.  Parking The coffee shop is located in a small town center. And despite some construction going on, plenty of street spots were available.  Extra Smelly Cat Coffee got the job done while searching for a pick me up in the NoDa area of Charlotte. And had the weather had been better, I believe I would have very much enjoyed sitting outside and sipping on my cool beverage. A place that probably needs more visits for a more complete analysis, but one with plenty of charm and solid coffee.",

With a modern flair, and comfy seats, I sat at the window to people watch.   My breakfast on this particular morning was a vegan bar that was perfect size, with a hot cocoa on an otherwise chilly morning in December. There was nothing wrong with the flavors I enjoyed on this particular day, and if you are a coffee drinker I imagine, based on the hot chocolate, that you will not be disappointed.",

I very much enjoyed the fact that it's a super short walk from the light rail stop. Therefore it's convenient for students from uncc as well as anyone coming from uptown Charlotte. It's a very nice location as well, there are multiple eateries right around the corner, just a short walk, desert places, and places to grab drinks with friends! The pricing is fitting for the quality, not bad at all! There's bar seating as well, so feel free to bring your laptop and get some work done, it's an excellent place for that.",

I really think the vibe has changed since they took out their on-site roaster; bring it back.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a cool place.   One of my favorite things about this place is that they make their own syrup flavorings.  I normally get vanilla syrup added to my coffee and it is phenomenal.  They have plenty of food options, but let me warn you.... I got a cheese biscuit and it was like eating rubber.  It was so bad I had to throw it out.  They should rethink their biscuit preparation.     Service is always fun and friendly. Parking is horrible, and there are not enough seat for dining in.   They really have outgrown this location.   Go check them out, but be prepared to park and walk!!",

Great decor (very funky) and I love to sails they use to give shade on the front patio. I would have locked a little something to eat but the baked goods weren't that appealing. I did buy a couple bags of coffee for home though.   If you're in NoDa and appreciate excellent coffee, stop by the Smelly Cat!",

They're probably the only place (or may be one of very few coffee shops in town) that serves cortados! and if you're not in the mood for caffeine, you can have beer, wine or ice cream instead. I wish they had better food options; it would be nice to have a fresh croissant with the coffee :)  the staff is wonderful and friendly. I've found that the ambiance in there is a reflection of the staff's mood.. late on a Saturday morning, it can get loud with chatter and music, and then there are times when it's quiet enough to get some reading done. They're a bit pricey to be my every morning coffee stop, but not at all a bad option for my weekend coffee fix..  you can pay by cash, card or Square (pretty hip huh ;) )",

Their coffee is still good and their baristas are still wonderful, but lately, they have been enforcing more and more policies about their bathroom and parking situations that just make them seem less welcoming.  Having to go back out into the rain to put my signed time-stamped receipt on my dashboard so that I'm allowed to keep my car there for two hours is not okay.  I understand the bathroom code because according to one of their baristas, some not-okay activities were happening in there, and I even understand having to ask for the wi-fi, but it's borderline rude to make customers feel like they have to validate their presence in your establishment.  Sure, parking is tight but it's NoDa and parking is an issue everywhere-that's the nature of the beast.    Anyways, they have good coffee, but I'm a little disappointed in their new customer policies.  It's less annoying to just go to Amalie's and put up with the ridiculous weekend crowds.",

As you walk in you'll notice a cabinet with board games so you can grab a cup and hang out for as long as you please while taking a trip down memory lane with a nostalgic game of Battleship.  You'll also notice the tables and booths around the place that make for perfect spots to chill or converse with friends.    The coffee is as fresh as it gets.  You can't miss the roaster where all the magics happens right there near the counter.  You can get all kinds of fancy hot or iced drinks or keep it simple with a cup of the Tanzanian brew (my personal favorite).   And the folks there are friendly and unpretentious.  They're helpful if you have questions or wish to venture outside the box to try something new.  Remember to tip!  If you visit NoDa and want the True experience that sums up the soul of the neighborhood, you must stop in here!",

Where some coffee places make their drinks too hot, both times my drinks were at the perfect temperature for immediate consumption.  I also had one of their big cranberry orange muffins, which was moist and not tart at all.    The space is cozy, with a few tables around.  It has a rustic, artistic feel to it.

We looked at the menu offerings, ordered several items to which she only repeatedly responded \"so sorry we are out of that.\" Smelly Cat's combative and \"customer is wrong\" response to my review only furthers my negative opinion of this restaurant and it's staff. I am simply a visitor from out of town looking for a good breakfast experience who was sorely disappointed. I have no reason to lie, but the employee does.

It's located in the Noda area (which parking can be such a chaos), but it has its own private parking lot  that's a huge plus. Also free wifi too!!!!  The shop has a very cozy fell to it, and has about 10 small tables inside and outside. It also has its own roasting machine, I guess that's a big plus for HUGE coffee fan. Personally I like my coffee sweet and strong like cuban coffee. However, I made the mistake of ordering a Hazelnut cold brew. I mean don't get me wrong I still like it, but I prefer some sugar to it.  I came here to do a little research, since we haven't install internet at our place yet. After sitting there 3 hours, I decided to order a Chai iced latte and lemon poppy muffin. The latte is pretty good, but didn't stand out to me as a MUST have in my drink list.  I will definitely go back for the extremely friendly staff, and to try the cuban coffee in a colder weather.",

The girl who helped us was very sweet and welcomed us, and mentioned that their Chai Tea Latte was pretty tasty. Chai Tea Latte's are one of my favourite drinks and so of course I wanted to give this one a try. My friend and I both ordered one, and when one of the staff members brought it to us at our table (which was also really nice!), we were both really impressed! We will definitely come back here.  The atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming. Board games are available for you to play with whoever you happen to be with!. We brought our own deck of cards so we played that for a while and a group behind us was playing a Harry Potter board game! Felt like I was at a peaceful family get together. Haha!  All in all a really great experience - I've recommended this to basically all of my friends.  The location is wonderful as well! Easy to just step out and walk around NoDa area and explore a bit.",

Highly recommend Smelly Cat if you want a great cup of coffee, latte, or cold brew!",

As someone who can drink coffee and go directly to sleep, I love a good late-night coffee shop. My cortado was perfect, the music was awesome and had me Shazam-ing more than one song, the baristas were super friendly and fast. Wish I could bring this place back to Brooklyn with me!",

The girl at the counter said they made their syrups and caramel, I indeed could taste the \"home made\" in it. The caramel was sweet and even a tad-bit salty which made it even better.  Finding a parking space was no problem, which is always a bonus. It being a Saturday night they were having a group of people doing spoke word session, which made us have a good laugh and added more personality to this coffee shop.  Got 3 coffees, and 4 pastries for less than $30 and had a great time.  Will be back soon for more caramel fraps!",

    "text": "When I walked into the Smelly Cat, I thought I had finally found a nice coffeehouse in Charlotte (visiting from Seattle for a week).  I liked the funky decor, the brick walls are covered with old doors and other interesting nick knacks, and they use more old doors to separate some of the tables into booths, with electrical outlets.  Outside it was sunny and there are nice little tables to sit at.  The first sign of trouble though, was when I asked for a \"cappuccino for here\", and was told they only had to go cups, but \"they did plan to get real cups sometime this year\", if I wanted paper cups, I would have gone to Starbucks.  The second sign was when I picked up the cappuccino and felt it's weight, there was clearly very little foam, and obviously was more of a latte, again I could have just gone to Starbucks and got one of their \"wet\" cappuccino's.  The final straw though was when I tasted it, it had hints of that taste you get in coffee from a run down truck stop.  I am not sure if they don't clean their machine or what, but it actually made me crave the corporate coffee.  I recommend that anyone visiting Charlotte to try Fabo in Selwyn Corner instead, it at least tastes a little better than the corporate stuff.",

Environment: I love the way that they use repurposed materials to decorate their space.  When repurposed materials are used for decorating, you really have to have an eye for what goes together well  and Smelly Cat did it well! You walk in and you see booths made out of reclaimed wood and old doors, exposed brick, and duct work. They have free Wi-Fi and outlets to plug in your laptop and phone. The place is cozy, functional, and visually interesting. There is also outdoor seating. They are coveted so good luck. We drank our coffee at the bar facing the window and scored outdoor seating as soon as some people left!   Service: Very Friendly! The barista explained the different options including the many food options, various brews, and their homemade syrups.   Coffee: Great! I followed the advice of some of my fellow Yelpers and ordered the dirty chai over ice. It was creamy, sweet, and delicious!   There is a parking lot that isn't that far from the cafe. It was reasonable and a short walk.   I enjoyed my visit to Smelly Cat!",

The coffee itself wasn't the best Ive ever had, but the location and atmosphere made up for it.   Usually there is a Farmers Market behind here that runs on Saturdays. We were going to try and check it out but it was raining so no one showed up. Super bummed!",

In a sea of Counter Culture coffee shops (which are not unappreciated, ftr), I applaud their independence earned by roasting their own beans in-house (on a 25lb Probat, no less).   Their music selection is current and trendy, appealing to most 20-somethings. They offer both manual pourovers, ready-brewed air pot coffee, along with full espresso and tea service. The free (passworded) wifi is also a plus.   If I had one qualm, it's that they serve flavored coffee offerings. Since they prepare all their offerings in-house, the lingering aroma is a little overwhelming. But coffee aficionados: don't let this dissuade you from stopping! They do a fantastic job with their roasts.",

The items are pre-made, wrapped in foil and kept in a glass case display warmer, reminding me of late night drunken 7-11 visits in my early 20s. There were maybe 3 different types of pastries in a similar (empty) case. I had the southwest burrito which was lukewarm, but tasted good and did the job, but I won't order it again.

The chai is not a syrup like some of the independent coffee shops in Charlotte and is made to order. They also have yummy biscuit sandwiches and breakfast burritos if you can get there early enough. Lots of seating inside and out and a great location if you just want to take your coffee to go and walk around NoDa. Even though they sell something as simple as coffee, their passion and amount of care they put in to their drinks really does make a difference.

The chai latte I ordered was decent. A little heavy on the milk and not so much chai flavor, but still an ok choice. I would probably order a latte the next time around though. My friend went with the peach smoothie, which she said was \"okay\" too.   I bought a mixed berry scone to go with the latte, which actually turned out to be rather disappointing. The texture of the scone was mushy rather than crumbly and the mixed berry flavor was faint. They didn't have a good selection of pastries (which was slightly disappointing). My almost $7 breakfast was an \"A-ok\" in my book, so 3 stars it is!",

The highlight of this place is their outdoor seating on a beautiful day, but even the inside is cute and cozy.

When my friends wanted to stop here for some coffee, I figured I'd just sit with a bottle of water and wait for them to finish. But then I noticed that hot cocoa was on the menu. As it was December and in the 40s, it seemed like a nice fit.  HOLY CRAP. There were chunks of real chocolate in there, AND I was asked if I wanted peppermint in it. Seriously? All this time I thought I was the only weirdo putting peppermint in hot cocoa. No one's ever OFFERED it before! It's like the mother ship was calling me home.  This heavenly concoction was thick and full of flavor. I know no one's ever made a claim to fame by having the best hot chocolate, but this place totally could.  The environment is quaint as well. It's quite eclectic, with several nooks and tables for you to settle into with a good book. 90s music tends to play frequently, and the staff is very nice.  A year later the same group of us found ourselves in Charlotte again, and I refused to leave without stopping at Smelly Cat for the best hot cocoa in the universe.",

Let me just say the woman Sam with the blonde hair was so kind and patient while we ordered. Sam was just plain amazing! She helped us with recommendations for breakfast, which we decided on the breakfast sandwiches (it was incredible and so fresh).   She even helped with our coffee order too and talked us into the lighter coffee telling us that this was in fact stronger (which was so cool that we learned something new).   Sam was amazing, smiled, made us feel comfortable, welcomed, asked where we were from, and didn't rush us through our order. We'll be back! Sam's an incredible person to have at your company!",

We both ordered sausage egg and cheese biscuits, one on a cheddar chive biscuit and the other on a regular biscuit. We also had a cold brew the Llorona and an iced brown sugar spiced latte. The biscuits were soft and flaky. We had no complaints with the food and the drinks were really good.  Smelly cat is definitely worth a visit if you are in Noda.",

This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops in Charlotte because of the setting and amazing coffee. I read my book here today for nearly 3 hours and was lost in my own world in my small sitting table with a comfy chair, plug if I needed it, and small walls to keep me from seeing too much commotion around. Also never felt pushed out by any of the staff even after I finished my coffee (normally I would leave or get a refill but I had 20 pages left of a riveting book).   With my nut allergy, they were super mindful of making sure I had a different milk frother than the almond one which was a nice touch.   Definitely a huge fan of this place and will be coming a lot more often to read. I also love the friends reference.",

My iced chai with oat milk was phenomenal, and I love that they applied the mixture to blended ice HOWEVER:  My husband and I ordered both a cold brew and an iced chai, and when ordering his drink, my husband asked the barista about her favorite options. He often does this to encourage baristas and add some variety to his order, however we were met with such an icy response that it threw us both off and I even jumbled my order when it was my turn.   I can empathize with someone that is having a rough day, and I completely understand that one glimpse into a baristas day does NOT show their entire ethical scope. But we also noticed some frustration among the staff that could have been dealt with more professionally. Such a shame.",

Scrambled eggs, arugula, tomatoes and avocado!  It was a perfect healthy breakfast. The weather is getting super warm so that means a lot more sitting outside.

    "text": "My life motto, Life happens between COFFEE and WINE, but not just any coffee. In what seems like a sea of new coffee shops in the area, not all stand out for many reasons to me, and oddly enough, for their coffee! They tend to be modern and fit every bill for those that work remotely -   a quiet place to work, caffeinate, but miss the mark on the coffee! I personally like a full bodied coffee, I do not like watery, mild tasting, drowning in milk/cream/oat/almond milk sort of buzz. I like that some of these shops have the option but again, completely miss the mark on the coffee. I am emphasizing on this because, Smelly Cat did NOT disappoint!   Location: NoDa is my neighborhood and I LOVE it, but I will be the first to admit that the parking situation is annoying. Smelly Cat has a limited amount of parking spaces and be careful, they will get your car towed if you aren't actually a patron. The fact that they have the parking, is a plus. Its a little house with seating outside amount all around it. The inside is small, but these ladies do not mess around. The inside has this modern, rustic chic thing going on and I like it! The small nooks at the front entrance for two are ADORABLE. The front bar area is new and they have breakfast cocktails. It took me a minute to realize what the update was, one because I was in need of coffee but also clearly, they served drinks.   Some Notables I must come back to try (pic of menu included in this review):  -Mexican Hot Chocolate: Tequila Blanco, truffle chocolate powder, steamed milk, cayenne, marsh mellows - yes please  -Dirty Chai Cocktail: Elijah Craig Bourbon, West India spice chai, espresso, milk, cinnamon - yes again  As noted, the espresso drink I had was simple with an extra shot (I had things to do when I left). I ordered a bacon egg and cheese biscuit sandwich and it was very good.   The service was fast and friendly. An all women team, not sure if this is their thing but I like it anyway - Girl Power!   Very well done ladies....I will be back!",

And really great outdoor spaces in front and on each side. My one regret: that they're not closer to my place in South Charlotte.",

    "text": "Short and sweet (okay not really but I'm a thorough person I guess). Point by point, at least:  + Girl at register was unpleasant and aloof, but in a particularly unusual and rude way, not just in the stereotypical \"aloof coffeeshop employee\" way. I felt like I was actively burdening her with my presence even as I stood there quietly and patiently waiting for her to be ready to take my order. One star off. If I lived nearby, that interaction alone would put me off returning regularly. Not a good sign.   + Fella who handed me my drink? Pleasant and cheerful. Plus one.   + Iced dirty chai? Awesome! I love the crushed ice and weird spice thing (I can't totally describe it but it's like what would happen if someone crumbled a ginger/molasses-flavored Oreo wafer in the bottom of the cup) going on in it. Kind of wish there was a little more ice to cool it a bit longer, but that's not a True complaint because I'm a slow drinker. Plus two stars.   + As I was sitting outside minding my own business in this glorious weather (I live in Durham, decided to visit Charlotte on a whim) while texting my brother in Colorado, a member of a ministry student group(?) who was meeting outside decided to come up to me and try to \"share something\" with me. As a devout atheist, I actively discouraged him and he went away pretty quickly, but it was very unpleasant. After that interchange I left the warm sunny bench I was sitting on to retreat to my car. Minus half a star because I know this isn't the business's issue, but soliciting/proselytizing at customers should be actively discouraged. Not sure if this is a regular weekend meeting place for the group of fellows or if it was simply happenstance on this particular day.  + Parking is confusing as fuck. I'm not familiar with Charlotte \"this side of sign\" parking and gave up on their terrifying(!) parking lot immediately and parked down the street. The weather was nice enough that I was fine with walking farther, but in crummier weather, I can't see doing it. Half a star off.   Three stars. The drink was great, the ambiance less so. I will admit 100% that I went here based on name alone (and the picture of a drink with crushed iced, I guess).",

It's a little vibrant coffee shop located in the Noda area. I'm a huge iced coffee fan but I thought ahhhh what the heck I'll step out of the box today. I tried a iced vanilla latte with almond milk and it was okay. You have to have an acquired taste to drink them but they were really good but much different taste from a iced coffee to clarify. The young lady behind the counter was super nice and helpful. Even let me sample a few things! Loved there outdoor seating and the fact that it has shade so I can still sit outside and enjoy a nice book even in June 90 degree weather. I'd definitely say try it out they offer more than just lattes!",

The parking is a complete nightmare mess in the area and there are signs everywhere warning of towing. Smelly cat even suggests putting you recipet on your dash of your car to protect it from towing.  I would be back here in a heart beat! Beat frappe of my life.

The workers at Smelly Cat are super friendly. They pretty much know everyone (if not actually everyone) in the 'hood. Plenty of parking in the SC lot and also on the street. Easily accessible.

There were 80's tunes playing when we arrived, local art on the walls, and excellent re-purposing of old shabby chic doors to form - I don't know what to call them - maybe table cubicles?  The doors divide space between tables along the walls.  What a great way to create semi-privacy.  I've never seen that done before, so major snaps for creativity.  Loved the concrete coffee bar and exposed industrial ceiling.  Smelly Cat is ultra hip.  Oh, with good coffee, by the way.",

    "text": "I wish Columbia had a place like this!   I've been to Smelly Cat (what a name!) twice and both times have loved it. I think last night it really took my breath away.   The reason I'm giving this place five is more for atmosphere than quality of food/drink. To be honest, I've only had a coffee, a tea, and a red velvet cupcake at the coffeehouse so I can't say I've sampled that much. From what I've ordered though, I've been very happy with what I got. As for the service, both times I've been to Smelly Cat, the baristas have been very sweet and professional.   But to talk about the atmosphere, well, WOW. Especially last night (Friday). I don't know if it's like this all the time, but the place was oozing community and felt so good to be a part of it. When we got there it was around 9pm and we wanted to get coffee and dessert and play a game of scrabble. There were a couple of tables outside and a few wicker benches to choose from. One table was occupied with a group of friends and their very loving and playful dog. Another table had a musician playing the xylophone. At one of the wicker benches, there was a small group playing the guitar. We snagged an empty four top and proceeded w/our scrabble game. Several pedestrians with dogs and children walked by. As the night progressed, a drum circle formed around the xylophone player and they created magical music. Many people who walked by stopped to dance and interact with the musicians. Inside the cafe as more people came in, there were others like us who cracked open board games and drank their coffee and chatted away.  I hate to sound new age, but the energy was astounding, and it was really cool to get to share some of it.  Also NoDa is a beautiful area, so the combination of the neighborhood feel, warm almost summer breeze, the music, and the smell of good coffee, was just priceless.",

The staff is helpful and engaging, the atmosphere is really conducive to quality conversations but also provides great space for someone who needs to plop down and grind out some work.  More importantly though - my drink was fantastic, and their in house bagels are phenomenal!  This place could definitely be my new go-to coffee place.",

I opted for their Ethiopian off a V60 , and when I prodded the girl at the counter for a little more info about it, i.e. where was it grown, she looked at me crooked and said \"Ethiopia\". Inspiring.  Another woman behind the counter who sort of looked like she could have been the owner said that was a valid question, but didn't know the answer and didn't bother to find out. The technique on the pour itself was poor. Splashing water over grounds does not make good coffee... Especially when half the water is poured straight down the filter. These folks need proper training. The cup itself was marginal. Under extracted likely due to bad technique, and the characteristics of the cup were such that, to me, suggested the roast had gone too long in the drum, slightly carmalized and somewhat scorched.  Lacking the bright acidity that draws me to beans from this origin.  Considering the near non existent coffee culture I guess there's not a ton of motivation for a shop to shine when they can squeak by on a convenient location, but really, if you're going to do something, do it well.",

I'm looking forward to my next visit  and have a cup of joe, as I'm confident that it will be as good as the tea. This area of Charlotte known as NoDa reminds me of South Street in Philly. Very cool/ seemingly nice people everywhere just doing their thing. This place is right in the epicenter. Came in feeling pretty shitty and left in a much better state of mind. Good music in the air, mellow lighting, nice muffins and other pastries and Strong wifi. I opened up my devices but found myself just enjoying the ambiance of this place and shut everything down and just chilled with my eyes closed for a while. I may become a regular. If your in NoDa check this place out. Btw...  unlike starbucks, you can order a SMALL- MEDIUM OR LARGE!",

You'll notice private tables and their coffee roaster right in the middle of the store. I've tried two of their blends, Black Cat being my favorite.

Honestly, we planned to just go in and sit down for maybe 5 minutes to have a cup of coffee, but we ended up staying and talking to Cathy for about 45 minutes. You can feel her passion for coffee and for her customers in the way she talks. She walked us through her entire roasting process and even let us taste the coffee beans! It's definitely a welcoming environment, unlike a lot of coffee shops that just want to get you through the line and out the door.   We had the cuban and cortadito, which were both delicious, and Cathy also gave us samples of both of their nitro cold brews. Having tried them before, I was completely against nitrogen-infused coffee, but theirs will change your mind! Both were very delicious and were infused with just the right amount of nitrogen, not over infused like other places that give it that almost beer-like taste.   If we lived around here, we would be in here every day!",

The space was quaint and cozy, a great place to wake up and start the day! Overall, this was the perfect coffee house for our Charlotte visit.",

If more places around here were open for lunch I'd be here more often than I'd like. As it is I treat myself to their fast efficient service whenever I happen to be around the area in the daytime instead.

Nice too that they gave me more hot water when I was done and I was able to use my tea bag for another cup.  The dessert was good as well as the sliced sandwich wraps.  The cons:  I once visited on a day that someone's child was allowed free reign. Like, I saw him playing in the seating area then running behind the counter TOUCHING things, no hand washing apparent.   Um, no.  On my last visit -- which was my LAST visit -- there was a dog in the shop. Animals are lovely just not in a place where I'm paying to eat.  As a former pet owner, I know that even when animals are banned from the kitchen, animal FUR can never be banned from anywhere animals are allowed.  The hair floats on the smallest of breezes and deposits itself where ever it happens to land...",

As soon as we arrived, we realized that this wasn't the kind of coffee house you could be productive at.

A coffee and some of the goods in the market make a wonderful start to the day.  The staff is really friendly and work quickly.  ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years.

It's a quaint coffee shop that was conveniently located next to a small farmer's market. They offer three size options for hot coffee beverages - starting at 8 ounces. I ordered the Dirty Chai with almond milk. It is the best Dirty Chai I've had to date. The espresso didn't taste burnt and mixed well with the chai mix used. They also have a rewards program which is nice. I believe I was auto-enrolled when I swiped my credit card. If I am ever back in the area, I will be back!",

Recycling aside,  Smelly Cat was the perfect place for some caffeine fortification before the return leg of a road trip. Ended up with a frappe with an extra shot of espresso, and it was lovely and tasty. The dirty chai gets a lot of press, but I love my classics. Parking is free for two hours (put your receipt on the dash!)  I assume that this is named for Smelly Cat of Phoebe of Friends fame (maybe they should have Friends reruns playing? too blatant?), and it's a lovely little coffee shop with plenty of comfy seating and knick knacks and decor that you'd expect from a local little hipster-ish coffee shop. This is totally the kind of coffee shop I would hang out in to catch up with an old friend, or to solo write or read. Busy, cosy, but not too crazy.  Side note: They ran out of whipped cream while fixing my friend Kristen B's frappe and I was as put out as a five year old who doesn't get rainbow sprinkles on her sundae. However, they said I could come back for it in a few, and they totally did when I came back for it later!",

Visited on a Sunday and it wasn't crazy busy but there were about 4 tables filled inside, while only 1 table, besides mine was taken outside. Ordered the iced Mojito Green Tea, and got too excited when I saw a gluten free peanut butter bar! Yesssss and it was OH SO DELICIOUS!

They have a giant contraption that they roast the green beans into what you're used to putting in your coffee grinder.  The coffee was delicious, a citrus raspberry taste with a light roast.  They also offered plenty of samples of their baked goods, which tasted amazing. I was happy to see that they offer real milk and cream, instead of the non-dairy creamer stuff.  There were plenty of places to sit and relax, play one of their games, or read one of their books. They offered lots of free literature at the front and back of the bar.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, and the prices were quite reasonable for the high quality of coffees they're serving.",

I was in the neighborhood looking at a house and figured I would swing by on this beautiful day, get a coffee, and do some reading! I did not get adventurous on my selection, just a regular latte, but when the latte is delicious there is no need to get experimental.  The inside is very cozy with some small tables for 2-4 people and some comfy chairs as well. Like I mentioned, I sat outside where there is also a lot of seating (probably more than inside). You can always tell the popularity of a place by the audience they serve. All sorts of people went in and out of Smelly Cat in the time I was there, and I loved it. Nothing brings people together like coffee!",

Anyway, I ordered, super nice people and all, but the tea latte wasn't that great. It was like warm when I got it which I don't know how since I got it straight away, and there was like, zero foam. What's a latte without foam? They also don't have stevia or my lesser choice, Splenda. My husband got the vanilla cappuccino. It was good, but very sweet. You know, sometimes you get a cappuccino more espresso tasting, and others more sweet? Well this one was the latter. The hubby was also treated to their fruity pebbles marshmallow treat. I'm not a fan of rice crispy treats, but I am a fan of fruity pebbles! This was a chunk of sugar rush that did not let me down! As the name suggests, there is something dying in there. It smells bad of you get the whiff. I don't like it. It's a cool, funky spot though to hang out and you can't be in there without thinking about Friends.",

Although I was only there for 20 minutes, the vibe and atmosphere is very welcoming and the perfect spot to read, study, chat and get your morning going. Right in the back of the Cafe, they have a small market on Saturdays which you can check out after you're done. It was definitely a cool spot filled with locals.",

I can't remember what I used to order all those times but I am now a fan of their ever-popular iced dirty chai latte (with almond milk). Is it too far of a stretch for me to say that Smelly Cat is pretty close to being considered hipster-ish?    In my experience, the employees are and always have been very knowledgeable and willing to break down any and all aspects of a drink. I've found that it's easier to ask about certain things than relying on the menu that's posted. Availability of some things change plus they're usually adding food items. On Sunday morning when I visited, they had scones, muffins, sausage/bacon & egg biscuits, and bagels - all made in-house. Maybe because it's the South, but I just don't see the need for a coffee shop to sell biscuit sandwiches. I skipped the food this time and happily sucked down my drink.  The dirty chai latte was/is delicious!!! The medium was $5.71 but I don't think it's that much more than what you would pay for the same drink at Starbucks. I loved that they prepared it with crushed ice and there was no need for any additional sweetener. The chai spice they use settles down at the bottom so be sure to give your drink a good shake before you take your first sip.  There are so many different drinks and coffee concoctions they that I look forward to continuing to drink my way around their menu!",

    "text": "Overall, I think supporting local business is among my top priorities. Which is why I continue to get coffee here when I can. Plus I really like the owners and their approach to being innovative in their business. But overall, it's not my favorite - the value of what you're getting compared to the cost always seems to be out of whack. The smell of the beans roasting is an instant no for me - I love the smell of coffee roasting, but this doesn't smell like coffee. Worst offense for me, though, is the parking situation - I will never understand how all the spaces are full, but no one is actually in the place. If I can't find parking, I usually just drive somewhere else.",

I love that they now offer \"real food\" that they make in house, meaning I can get breakfast, lunch, and light supper items there in addition to their pastries. One big difference compared to some mom and pop coffee places in the city is that they make their own syrups. I'm IN LOVE with the coconut syrup! The only challenges I've ever had are finding a (good) table [it's very small and popular location so space is at a premium, especially if it's too cold or hot to sit outside] and parking.   In Summary: + Fantastic Coffee!!! + Friendly staff/Good Service + Okay pastry/ Good Veggie Chili! + Vegan/Vegetarian Friendly + Quaint eclectic atmosphere (although very small) - Parking challenges",

The staff is friendly and almost all of them live locally so they're enjoyable to chat with and simply be around.  They recently have begun roasting their own coffee beans which adds a freshness and death to the coffee like I have never experienced before.   Don't forget that they also offer wine and beer as well as a discount for beer when you check in with yelp.  However, the selling point for me is definitely that they except Square... So load them up in your Square Wallet and put it on your tab so you can feel like you're already a regular your first time visiting.",

I've walked here many a time (from further down N Davidson St). Love that they have indoor & outdoor seating; however, on a nice day, you'll see everyone wants to be out on the patio.

They roast their own COFFEE!!!!!!!!! This is such an amazing thing for a small coffee shop to have. It is such a creative niche. The quality of their coffee is the best in Charlotte. HAND DOWN!!!!.   My favorite still is the dirty chai.   I would like to mention something weird about this place which makes it very special. I applied to work here right before the DNC, and I got past the first interview. They told me that I would have to sign a contract that I would be able to work for at least a year in order to get the job. Due to being a college student, I couldn't get tied down for a year, but I love that they want their employees to stay for at least a year so that they gain a bond with the customers. I would love to work for a company/business like this in the future.   There is also talk about getting their own bakery area. They are going to make all their baked goods in house. This place is going to be around for a long time.",

I mean, where else can you come in for espresso and sit next to a neighbor's dog curled against a booth and lazily awaiting its owner's return?  Where else can you have chocolate truffles and coffee (a combination that needs to proliferate, in my humble view)?  Look, this little nook of a shop makes a good brew and has plenty of tempting eats to nosh on.  If you want to step away from the big chains and get to know your local shops and the neighbors, the Cat fits that bill.  Baristas know the regulars and if you will just talk to them, they will make your drink to fit your preferences too.  If it's not, tell them and they'll remake it.    The wife and I like coming here if for no other reason than each trip is an experience- interesting people, interesting sights, and it feels like we find something new to try every time.  I recommend it to anyone who visits and encourage locals to go and support a local business doing it all right.  Like their Facebook page for notices of upcoming events and special products (not to mention a list of that days fresh brews).",

Having recently moved out of the area the one thing that I miss THE most are my daily trips to Smelly Cat.  I have been coming here for many years and I have to say that the group of people that work here are amazing. Forgive me if I misspell  anyone's name....Tony seems to have the roasting business mastered as he roasts all of their beans in house. Not only do I go for a cup daily but I also buy all of my beans for home from here. Tony really influenced my love for this place as he immediately learned my name , my favorite type of roast and it felt to me like each time I stepped in the door that I received amazing service from him. This stretches throughout all of the staff ( the Rachels are the same, super attentive , wonderfully kind and they go out of their way to make my visits great). On top of this the owner is a frequent face within Smelly Cat and within the local NoDa community. She is as pleasant as anyone I have met and I can tell that she has put her stamp on the culture of this business. I sometimes wonder how they are able to keep such a quality staff of people as you don't find this within many businesses, it clearly stands out!   I will be ordering all of my beans on line from now on and I have already figured out a away to steer my workday through NoDa a couple times a week just so I can still enjoy my favorite spot. The atmosphere is great, the staff are great and the coffee is great...thanks Smelly Cat crew!!!  -Cameron",

It was very slow (only 2 other customers in the place) and there was only one person working.  I ordered my standby, a skinny mocha, and was disappointed.  It barely had any coffee flavor and just didn't taste right for a mocha.  I also tried out one of the delicious-looking chocolate cupcakes which turned out to be just ok.  I'm starting to wonder if cupcakes just aren't my thing.  The part of the visit that makes me want to come back is the cozy and quirky atmosphere.  The decor is really cool with old rustic doors that section off seating areas and plenty of local artwork on the walls.  Although most of the tables I saw during my visit were dirty I have a feeling it isn't always this way.

Hubs and I have strolled in here a few times during Friday gallery crawls and have yet to be disappointed.   I've enjoyed a very good, and very sweet, white mocha. No doubt it would put most folks straight into sugar shock. On another occasion I've taken down a hefty strawberry croissant. While it wasn't at the caliber of other local bakeries, it was still flaky and scrumptious. I also remember a time that I enjoyed some type of mango iced tea. Even unsweetened it was the perfect accompaniment to a sweltering summer day.   Until next time, Smelly Cat, I'm going to try to get this song out of my head now.",

Having a lot of technical terminology to learn - the distractions here were  worse than my dogs.   But for a coffee shop to chill and surf the web --- this is a great place. The music selection overhead was perfect, the ambiance is cozy, the counter staff professional and with smiles.   I ordered a non-fat cap and it was velvety, smooth, and delish. The beans they use are roasted to perfection.   I will have to check out the Smelly Cat again when my brain is not required.   Thanks for the Java Jolt Smelly Cat!",

    "text": "By far the best customer service I've ever had..hands down.  My husband and I went here for the first time today after I had heard some great things about this coffee shop.  I ordered the iced dirty chai latte which they are known for.  I personally wasn't a fan of it..there was some sort of spice in there that didn't agree with me.  I want to note that many many people LOVE this drink so I encourage you to still try it even though I didn't care for it.  I don't believe it was anything they did wrong it just was not my personal favorite.  I was a little nervous to ask for my money back but figured I'd at least ask since I knew I wasn't going to be able to drink it.  Cathy (the owner) was extremely nice.  She asked if they could remake it for me or if I wanted to try something else on top of her giving my money back for the drink..I told her that was okay (I already felt bad for returning the drink!). Then on top of that she encouraged me to come back and try something else and the drink would be on the house.  I've never received such great customer service and encourage anyone to give this place a try.  The next time I'm in the area I will try a different drink.  They also roast their own coffee and offer almond and soy milk which I appreciate since dairy milk does not agree with my stomach.  Terrific owner!",

    "text": "I was passing through Charlotte again and decided to pay another visit to the Cat.  My first review (which I would urge you to read for the humor alone) documented Lattegate.  They have pretty baristas here - today the beauty of the barista split me down the middle like a battleaxe.  Yes, I just compared being struck by beauty to being split with a battleaxe.  I wonder if that is \"awesome\" or not.  Some choose Cupid - I apparently choose Viking imagery.  Anyway, this time I ordered your regular ol' coffee and realized that the beans are from Dilworth.  Dilworth is a place that I absolutely savaged in a Yelp review because I felt that it wasn't what it was advertised to be, but you'll note that I never had a problem with the beans, which is an arena where Dilworth truly does a good job.  I'm glad that Smelly Cat is sourcing beans from a local, high quality roaster.    The cup was great; I then realized that there was a wine rack on the wall.  Malbec, what what?  Yes please.  I must have missed this aspect of Smelly Cat before.  They had a malbec from Argentina that was very tasty.  This is one of the grape varietals used in production of Bordeaux within France and is popularly grown in Argentina - I am digging malbec these days.  I followed up my coffee and wine by bashfully approaching the barista to ask about the wifi.  It's a password-protected wifi system.  In the end, Smelly Cat is my home base in Charlotte as far as coffee is concerned.  As long as life keeps dragging me through Charlotte I'll be stopping by.",

    "text": "There was an intermittent alternate dimension happening at Smelly Cat over the past couple of days, and it made for great people watching. Case in point: today several groups of fourth graders paraded in throughout the day to read their own poetry, open-mic style. It was quite the site to see, what with all of the rhyming prose and the enraptured listening of the teaching set, and when it was over? Snaps, just like the beats like it. Ginsberg might have been confused, but he might have been proud.  Smelly Cat Coffee House is just what the name implies, a cozy cove of fluffy chairs, enclaves, and cafe tables that make camping out here in NoDa fun. My meetings today flew by, not the least of which was because of the hazelnut Italian soda I slammed, or the arty ramblings of children, or the giant leafblower that careened about when I sat outside for a bit. It's a little on the small side, but you don't have to be gigantic to be a cool coffee room. And as it turns out, if you're here, the ability to snap effectively helps.",

I thought decaf and cold brew coffee were both sacrilege, until I tried the Peruvian (get it as a pour over, Leah knows her shit!), Snickerdoodle, and Hazelnut. Also, just try a pour over with any of the roasts, it'll open your eyes to a whole new level of coffee goodness!",
