    "text": "Well, first off I want to say I visited this restaurant during queens Feast aka restaurant week. Appetizer: Butter Lettuce - tasted good but was very salty much like most food in Charlotte. Main Course : Bavette Provenca - very undercooked and super chewey and it was honestly not editable. I should have said something but I did not. The other person I was with had the same thing and his was fine. Desert : devils food cake - probably the best part of the meal along with my tea. Again, it could have been better without the dried fruit which made is oddly sweet. So, all in all I am going to say it was 'ok' and I probably will give them another chance. Another thing that was quite odd, we asked for a normal menu and they basically did not have one. I mean if you are doing restaurant week and want people to come back? Have a menu for people to see? Common sense IMHO. Also, this restaurant is very odly placed and very hard to find. Hope this was not too long. But, this was my experience and I shall try them again.",

Then I had the parsnip soup. Hands down one of the best soups I've ever had. It was delicate and silky, garnished with a cilantro drizzle that added just the right pop and accompanied by a goat cheese crouton that added crunch and depth. Then I tried the kale salad. The kale was massaged correctly to give it a tender texture and dressed lightly but had beautiful layers of flavor. For my main entree I had the duck. Perfect way to end because the lardon gave me that saltiness I like to end my dinner with. Don't forget to finish with a housemate tart of some sort. I hard lemon and was completely satisfied!!!  The food and the service exceeded my expectations. Must try!!",

    "text": "This is an update on my last review. 20 people from our dining out group went to Aix en Provence on Tuesday, March 8th. We had reservations for 28, but there is quite a bit of illness floating around our condo this spring. The eight cancellations came in on the day of our reservation. The owner of the restaurant was visibly upset that we were eight people short. We apologize profusely noting the illness of the patrons.  He made a snide comment and disappeared into the kitchen. That's not what you would expect when you have twenty paying customers on your doorstep. The two waiters assigned to our tables made up for the slight. Our waiter, Brian, had an exceptional touch in guiding our table through the dinner menu and wine list.  The mussels were superb. They were tender and in a mildly spicy broth. The canard cassoulet was rich and spicy and delicious. The sausage and lardons played off the duck very well. And, The white beans mellowed out the richness of the rest of the dish.  Even the hardest nosed gourmets at our tables had nothing but praise for the dishes that came out of the kitchen. It's a shame that the owner did not come out to visit at our tables as he is done previously. Maybe his attitude would have improved had he heard the kind comments from the diners in our group. Upon our leaving, Brian wished us a good night and thanked us for visiting the restaurant. We will go back.  My dining out partner and I are part of a dining out group. We were scouting out a new restaurant for the March event and chose Aix en Provence. We went there midweek. The owners have updated the restaurant. It is quite pleasant and warm feeling. Even though the menu is limited, there is enough variety where a diner has choices. The wine list is decent both by the bottle and by the glass. The service was superb. I ordered the escargot. It was nicely done with a miniature puff pastry on top of each snail. However, it did not have enough garlic for my taste. My partner had the frog legs. They were tasty and tender. My fresh pasta dish was perfectly done with a lamb ragout. In a ragout I prefer chunks of meat to diced meat as it was served. The French press coffee was strong, rich and flavorful without being bitter. The lemon tart was light and bright without the usual strong lemon aftertaste. It is served with a small scoop of thyme and basil flavored sorbet. It was refreshing. We will be going there in March with approximately 20 diners. We have high expectations; the manager said they can handle the crowd.",

Not knowing a lot about French cuisine I was really curious to see what the restaurant was about. Tucked away next to a Starbucks near the Harris Teeter on Providence Road is this tiny bistro, nondescript outside, a veritable passport to France once inside. Parking is scarce but you can always park at the Starbucks as that one closes at about dinner time. I sat in the bar within earshot of a French man singing and playing keyboards as entertainment for the evening. I ordered a lovely charcuterie plate as an appetizer which was excellent and a main course of beouf and pommes frites (hanger steak and French fries). Everything was excellent and the waitress was very attentive. The restaurant was sort of slow that night, but fantastic nonetheless. I am definitely going to go back soon and try some of the other dishes.",

I really enjoy it when the food is allowed to be the star and not the chef (which non intuitively really means the chef is a superstar) The salad dressing was so flavorful and yet so lightly applied that the greens look so fresh and undressed. Give this spot a try and you will not regret it.",

I don't think I've ever given a 5-star review where I didn't think the food was spot-on superior, until now. What impressed me about Aix en Provence was the service. The hostess was extremely caring, even calling me back on the phone a few minutes later after our dropped phone call, and was extremely courteous. Server was very kind and knew the menu. We ordered a tagliatelle with lamb, which was cooked al dente and flavorful, but perhaps not exactly my flavor palette. She had the seafood soup, which was great and the highlight of our dinner. I had the steak/fries, which was very average and frankly not recommended for $30. We had a small cake with apple compote which they were so kind as to comp for our celebration. And to top it off they even gave us a congratulatory card. They made our night feel very special. We'll certainly remember this. Thank you!",

I had the paella and my wife had the duck and sausage cassoulet.  For dessert we split the chocolate souffle.  I cannot emphasize enough how great all of the courses tasted.  The starters and pasta dishes are small enough that you can split them and enjoy an entree.   I had a specialty drink, the Le Boulevardier and it was great.  Then switched to an old fashioned and it was not that good but it was the only issue we had.  It was busy even at 10:00pm which was great to see.  Don't miss trying this place.",

I went for a family dinner on a normal Saturday night. The restaurant is located in a very unpretentious location next to a Starbucks. So my family likes to try everything on the menu... and the general consensus was that the portions were too small, not much value there... but the disappointing part was the execution was not as to be desired. The foie gras had good flavor, but it was literally a spoonful... not enough to share. The classic moules were good, but again the portion was too small for my taste. The best appetizer we had was the daily special which was sweetbread with a sweet chutney.   The tagliatelle was good, but I didn't get a lot of the Moroccan flavors as I was expecting. The roasted corvina was nothing out of the ordinary. The best entree we had for the evening was the cassoulet. I honestly felt like I was in the French alps having the dish... warm, full of flavor and well executed - I wish they had a little more garlic sausage to go around.   The service, as expected, was very good and the desserts were ok.... they do have a chocolate souffle which was decent - make sure to order it 20 mins in advance.   I also have to say the patrons were not very diverse, I felt a little weird. Maybe it was just that day...",

When we were seated, our server came with a bottle of (very nice) champagne and each of us were poured a glass in celebration of the birthday honoree. In addition, a birthday card signed by all the staff was waiting on our table. That was such a nice beginning to our evening.  The menu consists of small plates, pasta and risotto offerings and regular size entrees. Some plates vary daily such as the charcuterie platter and foie gras. I chose the butternut squash and ham hock agnolotti that was wonderfully light and flavorful along with the butter lettuce salad. My dining companions started with the Oeuf Norwegian which is smoked salmon wrapped around a poached egg. Beautiful presentation and very delicious. They then shared two entrees: the braised lamb tagliatelle and the duck comfit Cassoulet Campagnard. Both dishes got rave reviews.   From a service standpoint, all went quite well. Our server was informative without being pushy. He was easy going yet very attentive. His wine recommendations were very much in keeping with how we described our tastes. When he brought our dessert choice, he included a small birthday candle. The candle didn't cooperate so he left the dessert but took the candle back to the kitchen only to bring the lit candle back in a small dish for the birthday honoree.  Our evening was enhanced by a visit from Chef Owner Nicholas Tarnate. We were glad we could let him know how nice our evening had been. It's really the small things that make dining an event. Aix en Provence pays close attention to all details and especially to the small things.",

We were greeted with champagne to celebrate our anniversary. Our server, Paula, provided the best service we have had here in Charlotte. She made excellent recommendations and was very knowledgeable about the wine menu. We started with the foie gras and escargot. Both were perfectly executed. We could not get enough of the foie gras! For my entree, I ordered the bouillabaisse. It was so good! The flavor was out of this world! My husband ordered the steak and frites. Steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We finished our meal with a classic vanilla bean creme brulee. It was delightful! Aix en Provence is hands down the best French restaurant in Charlotte! We will be back!",

Cocktails were yummy and the food was great: we ordered the escargot which was hands down our favorite of the food we enjoyed. Hubby ordered the duck confit for dinner which was delicious and I had the lobster spaghetti which was good but probably not something I'd order again. Great restaurant for a date but probably not a spot we'd add to our regular rotation. I would give this 4.5 stars if Yelp would let me!",

The salmon at Aix en Provence was still good, but the creme brulee and the French fries that accompanied the mussels, and the bread were only alright. I gave this restaurant a harsh rating for the price and because it already has a good rating on yelp that gave us a False expectation of the quality.",

I always get the daily Foie Gras appetizer which never disappoints. In addition to the stellar food, the service is superior.

Last week at dinner instead of ordering one of my standards I thought I would have their rack of lamb. It was one of the best pieces of meat I had all year, in fact the only place in Charlotte whose meat was as good was Capital Grill and I prefer the service at Aix. When you are in the mood for a great piece of meat think out of the box and have dinner at Aix instead of your normal steak house.",

My cassoulet was an experience in itself and the duck was was soft and tender ... just thinking about it makes my mouth watered. My wife had the red snapper, a special for that day and that too was equally as good. We've been to a lot of French restaurants here in the US and this is by far one of our very few favorite, and that's saying something because it's really hard to impress my wife with French food since she lived there for a while too.   The only 1 negative that I would comment on Aix-en-Provence was the server took a little bit of time to come to get our order and server could be a bit more engaging.  However,  that was not enough to take not make this a 5 star experience for us. We finished all of our food and the Paris Brest was an excellent way to finish off our night. We will definitely will be back again.",

We were first brought an amuse bouche of Duck Rillette; it was the perfect little bite. My dad and I split the Escargot for an appetizer (both our first times having it) and they were superb. I would most definitely order them again. We ordered a red wine from Burgundy, France that was really good. I believe it was number B15 (very easily labeled because their wine list is so extensive!!) Paula, our waitress, was wonderful and was very knowledgeable of the menu items! I ordered the Lamb Tagine and my dad ordered the Bouillabaisse. So good. The lamb was absolutely amazing, literally fall off the bone, and my dad said his bouillabaisse was the best he's ever had. I wish I took pictures but I was too busy eating everything. For dessert we had their Chocolate Souffle and the Paris-Brest. So good, and the perfect finish to the evening. I have to say, the kitchen staff really knows what they're doing here; my next stop is going to be their other restaurant in Waxhaw.",

    "text": "I usually never write a review about a Restaurant Week experience because it's typically not their best food but we had such a great experience I had to rave about it! Tucked away next to the Starbucks, you might not ever notice it (used to be Terra) but it is a little gem! Named after the absolutely gorgeous city in the south of France, Aix en Provence, one of my favorites, I had high hopes for the food but hadn't tried it yet because the previous menu had a lot of cilantro on it. Thankfully I was not disappointed.   Our server was Aaron and he was just about my favorite server I've ever had. He did not steer us wrong. We started with some really interesting craft cocktails we both couldn't get enough of.  We had the heirloom tomato salad on burrata, steak au poivre, and peach clafoutis. The burrata was actually quite mild and not as gamey as some Italian burrata can be. The \"au poivre\" sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the expertly seasoned steak. It was a solid 5 star meal all the way around. Just delicious flavors at every turn. Hubs had the smoked salmon tartine (on a baguette), duck cassoulet and chocolate ganache. It was delicious, decadent and satisfying. Through the evening, Aaron was friendly, attentive and gave us great suggestions. The interior left a lot to be desired (it was generic restaurant furniture with a few paintings of Provence) but the food and service definitely made up for it.   We look forward to returning and when the weather cools off having wine and dinner on the front patio!",

This restaurant had been on my list since moving to Charlotte and I finally was able to visit taking my girlfriend out for an Anniversary dinner. It did not disappoint in the slightest!  When we walked in we were immediately taken to our table and were greeted with a complimentary glass of rose champagne and a nice card congratulating us on our anniversary signed by the staff. This was indicative of how service would go the entire night - fantastic.  Our server brought us an Amuse bouche and took our order. From there, plate after plate of delicious food was brought to us. Everything we are was legitimately good or great, with a special shoutout to the Moroccan tomato soup and the hanger steak. YUM.   There were also a few \"regulars\" in the restaurant that seemed to be in some sort of wine club or something similar. They were all congregated around a couple tables and seemed to be having a great time. That goes to show this place can be formal for a date, but also be chill enough so you can enjoy a bottle (or 8) of wine with some friends!  If you're looking for a special night out, this is a great option if you want to go French! We will be back 100%",

The atmosphere is inviting yet quaint and service is top notch, with very personalized attention to each table.  After being seated we ordered some champagne, which was delivered with the first course of the night, the Amuse Bouche, a ramp puree.  It was a light bite to start the night and I enjoyed the ramp flavor. For starters we enjoyed the Mushroom Bisque Soup and Fois Gras. The Fois was one of the highlights of the night. Entrees included the Bouef, Steak Frites, and the Cassoulet with Duck Confit.  The Bouef was cooked medium rare, sliced thin with a light caper gravy and frites.  The Cassoulet with Duck Confit included garlic sausage and bacon lardons, heaven.  For dessert we couldn't pass up the Chocolate Souffle, which had to be ordered 20 minutes in advance.  Upon delivery the waiter cut the middle open and poured a thick, rich chocolate sauce into the souffle!   As others have said, it you are looking for a special night out, enjoy a French flair with amazing food and outstanding service, Aix en Provence is your spot.",

We started off with the Spanish octopus (pictured) which was super flavorful and the smoked salmon terrine (such a different and unexpected dish but INCREDIBLE! If you like salmon I highly recommend this dish). For our mains I ordered the venison and my bf ordered the beef. My venison was super tender and the mushrooms that accompanied it were delicious. The beef my bf got was to die for-super juicy and covered in a peppery cream sauce with crunchy and salty fries on the side! What more could you want Oh yeah-DESSERT! As if we were already stuffed, we ordered the chocolate souffle and oh my gosh my mouth is watering just thinking of it. It was so decadent and the perfect way to end the night.",

    "text": "This wonderful little Mediterranean bistro in Myers Park may not look like much from the outside -- tucked against one of Charlotte's most popular Starbucks, it has the unassuming air of a corner jazz club -- but inside, you'll be transported to a kitchen table in a French villa for a meal you won't soon forget.   On a recent visit with friends, we started with plates of Foie Gras and Escargot that were both dripping with flavor. Paired with an outstanding Bordeaux selected by our exceptionally attentive server, they were delicious and gone much too quickly. We followed up with a fantastic bowl of Risotto, perfectly prepared with herbs and mushrooms, and a wonderful dish of Cavatelli Bolognese.   The entree, however, was the only disappointing aspect of an otherwise wonderful meal. The Cassoulet Campagnard, a duck confit with garlic sausage, came highly recommended, but was somewhat bland and lacking in flavor. Most was forgiven, however, when we finished off the meal with a wonderfully rich slice of chocolate cake.   We enjoyed Aix en Provence -- the intimate setting, first-class service, amazing wine and delicious pasta all made for a memorable dining experience. I may give the Cassoulet another try on my next visit, or just stick with the pasta dishes I enjoyed so much. Either way, Aix has definitely earned a second opportunity to knock my socks off.",

To start, I found the waitress to be warm and welcoming, knowledgeable about the menu, and willing to make honest recommendations about what to order.  The house bread and butter were quite tasty--nothing that would blow you away, but certainly enough of a cut above the usual to grab your attention.  We ordered the escargot to start. They were, in short, lovely--tender, juicy, and all-around delicious. The pastry that sat atop them was a nice touch--I liked how the escargot and pastry melded with one another, a kind of thoughtful experiment in mixing wet and dry substances.  For the entree, I ordered the cassoulet. It proved to be the highlight of my evening. The lardons, juicy and flavorful, stood out most, although the duck confit was a close second.  All in all, I found the portions to be perfect in size. Between the house bread, the shared appetizer for two, and the cassoulet, I felt neither like I'd overeaten nor like dessert was necessary.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is even considering dropping by.",

    "text": "I'd been told by a handful of people that I had to try Aix en Provence so I finally made it last Friday night. We didn't really know what to do for dinner and the night had gotten away from us but my husband and I were able to grab a 9:15 reservation about 45 minutes beforehand. When we arrived we were seated right away at a nice table on the side of the room. Our waitress was very nice and helped us picked out a fantastic bottle of Bordeaux. The amuse bouche was a smoked salmon and it was delicious. They also give you warm bread with butter (and are happy to refill it when you plow through it). We started with the escargots, which were great. They were very flavorful and the little puff pasty on top adds a nice texture. For our mains I had the ragu and my husband had the steak frites. My pasta was perfect, it had a nice chew and the sauce was fantastic. It was meaty but also coated the pasta nicely. This is one of those dishes I'll keep on my \"go-to comfort foods\" list in Charlotte. The steak was also delicious and cooked perfectly, and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. I have no shame in saying we cleaned our plates. We also saw a chocolate souffle come out to another table and towards the end of our entrees our waitress came to tell us about it since it took about 15 minutes, so we obviously ordered one. That night it was a dark chocolate with sea salt and a creme anglaise (I think this was white chocolate). I didn't even think I wanted dessert that night but the souffle + my last glass of the Bordeaux is the only kind of Friday night I'll ever need. The chocolate was rich and decadent and the salt and white chocolate were subtle but nice. This is one of the best meals, and dining experiences, I've had in Charlotte. Everyone is very friendly and the service was great. We were checked in on enough to make sure we had what we needed but it wasn't overbearing. The atmosphere is romantic and relaxing and it's not pretentious at all. It's the perfect spot for a date night or if you just want a seriously awesome dinner.",

    "text": "Date night with the wife and chose Aix based on several articles and recommendations.  Good News is that they were all accurate as Aix is the best restaurant in Charlotte that I have been to in the last 3 years. Bad news is that Aix is not closer to our home and I cannot enjoy their food as often.    Started with a nice bottle of Bordeaux and the Charcuterie platter which featured a nice portion of pate, salami, and Prosciutto.  The best $17 you can spend in Charlotte I promise you that! We debated the menu offerings and settled on Risotto, and Bouillabaisse. Lets start with the Risotto, a creamy blend of Arborio and mushrooms which was decadently rich and perfectly cooked. The Bouillabaisse was prepared with a lobster broth to which I detected a hint of fennel and topped with mussels, clams, scallop and a perfectly pan seared filet of Corvina (drum fish).  All of the restaurant guest stared as I turned up my bowl to slurp the final drops of that broth and licked my bowl clean, well I wanted to do that but reconsidered.  During our meal we were asked if we would like to order the dark chocolate souffle for dessert as it takes 15 minutes to prepare. Wife'e eyes sparkled at the mention of Dark Chocolate so I knew the short answer was yes, order the souffle don't even ask how much it will cost just bring it on.    Cant wait to return to Aix En Provence.  Food: 5 Sporks Service:  5 Sporks Atmosphere: 4 Sporks  Local Beer: 2 Sporks Value: 3 Sporks",

    "text": "Had been eager to have lunch here and boy, it didn't disappoint!   My friend, Kath, and I were the only ones who were in the restaurant for our lunch time, so we had a private restaurant experience.  Our server, Paula, originally from Oregon, fit the the place like a glove!  She had sophistication and elegance, just like the atmosphere and the menu.  French restaurants can sometimes be challenging for me, since. I am not a fan of shell fish or heavy sauces.   Today, however, I lucked out on some selections that were brilliant!  Started with the soup of the day, which was a chilled roasted pepper soup.  I initially didn't order any, but one tablespoon of Kath's soup had me yelling for Paula to bring me some too!  It had a flavor that hinted of red peppers, but in a subtle way.  It did not taste creamy or heavy.  My lunch entree was the crispy chicken Milanese.   It was served on tega hills greens with a champagne vinaigrette.  Just divine!  Paula assured me that I could call in advance to order it for dinner one night, since it is not on the more complex dinner menu. On Monday and Tuesday nights, they have a keyboard player.  I have already made an August reservation on a Tuesday evening to soak up with atmosphere again and to enjoy the same dish all over again.  And finally,  I won't end without mentioning the pommes frites, which were served in a basket and shared by both of us.  They were not your average French fry.  I am not sure what they did to them to make them taste so light and delicious.  There was not even a piece of one left over in the basket.  This will definitely be another repeat selection.  The music and atmosphere and food and baguette all transported me to the middle of France for two hours, and I never had to pull out my passport once.  Two thumbs up and five stars all the way.    Merci.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here yesterday on a date night. I was excited to go to a French restaurant after all these years.  The food, service and ambience were excellent.  Our server Paula (?) knew the menu and wine list inside and out and helped to create a perfect experience.  The food reminded me of many small local restaurants up and down the Rhone valley in Provence.  Well balanced cuisine is the main theme of French food.  We had grilled Octopus, escargot and foie gras to start. The escargot is cooked with a delicious flakey small pastry that well balanced the earthy taste of the snails. The foie gras was creamy and smooth with a raspberry compote that perfectly paired with the foie gras. Did I mention the Sautern wine that came with the foie gras...delicious.  The grilled octopus was paired with a nice amount of paella-like rice.  On to the main course. We ordered the Bouillabaisse and Cassoulet. We wanted to split both and our server accommodated us by sending us the Bouillabaisse first. You could taste the sea in the broth and the seafood was a nice mix of mussels, small clams and a white fish with a crispy crust that was moist and tender underneath.  You feel like you're in Marseille while eating this.  Oh Cassoulet! How I love you. This epic French farmer dish was lovingly done. The beauty of French food is they take heavy ingredients like beans, lardon (pork belly), sausage and duck and some how balance them into a not heavy tasting experience. This restaurant nails it!  We finished up with an incredible cheese plate that we consumed rather quickly. Small amounts of strong tasting fromage. Oh yeah, it was good.  Anyway, I highly recommend Aix. It's legit. Note, the two bottles of Chateau Neuf de Pape may have biased my experience. But that is the point, isn't it, after all?",

Octopus a la plancha appetizer was prepared differently due to seasonal change in the menu. We had it roasted with white beans and chorizo. I love octopus! Not crazy about the beans (in general)but the Chorizo was perfect to add a little kick.  It's very small inside so make a reservation and prepare to be cozy with the neighbors.  I wasn't feeling well so while the wine list looked extensive I did not try anything.
