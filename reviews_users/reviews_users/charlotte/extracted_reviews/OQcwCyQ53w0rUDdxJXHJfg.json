The song Hurt by Johnny Cash is requisite listening after visiting this establishment.   The service, however, was wonderful. The waitress was charming and quick.",

My boyfriend and I enjoy coming here for our date nights. It has nice ambiance, good service and food. Comparing this to Texas Road House, I would always choose Carolina Prime. It's not too loud, when I ask for a medium rare steak, that is exactly what I get...never have had to send it back. My boyfriend likes RARE steaks, and that is exactly what he gets. The appetizers are wonderful...the desserts are good too. This is one of the most inexpensive steakhouses I have seen, and the value is way past what you pay!!   OH...and last time we went, we both had burgers. Their burgers were hot and juicy...definitely a must try!!",

If you don't know the difference between medium, medium well, and well done, then maybe you should stick to some other type of item.   My server was nice enough and very pleasant to deal with. If I understand it however, the owner is the also cook... Not pleasant to deal with. I ordered a 12 ounce ribeye medium well. After being brought one that was medium rare with a cool bloody center, I was then brought a skinny cut that was completely brown all through, overcooked for even well done.   I did not ask for the cook and I was content enough to just eat my meal and go about my business. But the server insisted that she get him for me. But when he came out he seemed incredulous that someone would call into question the quality,  and at that point I was resigned to the fact that my burnt piece of beef was punishment for questioning the first one.  I'm content to just not ever return.  I do wish them the best and I hope that other customers have had better experiences.",

So this is not Ruth Chris, however I can say the steak entrees I saw looked amazing, my burger was the best that I have had in a LONG time.  Seriously, fresh hand made patty grilled to order and so flavorful! * nom nom nom*. I almost ordered another one.  The girls that were work here are not only adorable (think kittens with a ball of yarn), but super sweet and attentive. Bonita was my server tonight and she was anything but mediocre. She dazzled me the minute I sat down. This place is authentic as it gets in terms of \"mom and pop\" steak houses. I\"ll take Carolinas Steak House over the Outback, LoneStar or any other pretentious chain.  If you want a great meal and FANTASTIC service, look no further than this quaint little place.  And for the critics who think this place has bad service, try finding this kind of (sincere) hospitality in any other joint in the country! Thanks Bonita!",

The friendly wait staff, who are mindful of potential time constraints during the lunch rush, push it to a 4 in my book for the type of establishment that it is.    Located on Woodlawn near the Old Pineville intersection, Prime has been here for many years serving breakfast (which I have never had here), lunch (which I have had every couple of months for years) and dinner (which I have never had here).  I typically have the chopped sirloin special with onions and gravy (hold the mushrooms) along with a salad and another side (mac and cheese special, fried squash, potatoes, rice, etc.) for $9 + drink.  The london broil special, served over rice with 2 sides for $12, is also quite good.  I love that they put their salads in chilled bowls, which keeps them cold and crunchy.  The sides always taste homemade and fresh.  While you are waiting for your meal, a sliced loaf of warm bread is a nice treat.  The tea is southern sweet.  If you still have room for dessert without taking off your pants, their sweet treats are also quite good.  (Pepsi products are served - bleh).",

    "text": "Took a day 'adventure' trip with our two children and ended up near South Blvd.  I had driven by this restaurant many times and thought it would be nice to try.  This was on a Monday, so when we arrived about 8pm, it wasn't very crowded.  The decor is a little over the top, but most steakhouses tend to be that way.  The menu had lots of options, but seemed pricey.  We decided to stay and give it a try.  Out of our group, we ordered 2 steaks.  I ordered a large prime rib to split with my wife and my 8 year-old daughter got the kids sirloin (I would guess It was a 4oz steak).  An hour passed and I had gotten my salad and we had gotten some bread and that was about it.  Finally, after another 10-15 minutes, we got our meals.  My daughter's steak was raw and the prime rib was an end cut and was dry and well done through about half of the cut and then a light pink in the very middle only and overall very dry.  Not the way a prime rib should be cooked.  I proceeded to tell the waitress about the steaks and she offered to bring us 2 more.  I told her we couldn't wait another hour for our steaks and she said she would get them out as soon as possible.  At this point, the manager/owner came over and told me he thought the prime rib looked fine and he would throw the small sirloin back on the grill.  He also stated that the delay was because they cook the meat to order.  First of all, you don't cook a prime rib to order.  They should already be close to the correct temperature and then finished off as the orders come in.  It was obvious that the piece was cut off an uncooked prime rib that was in the fridge and then put in the oven to cook it quickly and then put on the grill to finish it.  It was cooked and well done on all sides, so there was no cut from the rest of the rib.  My daughter's steak was only 4oz, so how long does that take to cook?  I don't see that it would take an hour for what we ordered, so he tried to tell us something that wasn't True.  The point is that he wanted to argue with me that the prime rib was fine when it was burnt and crusty on the outside and dry on the inside.  He lost that argument as we decided to leave until he handed me a check for a salad, drinks and the side my wife had ordered to go with the prime rib.  Another 15 minutes passed until clearer heads prevailed and the lady at the front told us to not worry about it.  I will never come back when he tried to give us a line about the delays and the quality of the food.  You shouldn't offer something you aren't prepared to present with your best quality.  Cutting the end of a prime rib and trying to make it a prime rib in an hour doesn't work and just frustrates your customers.  Don't lie and just tell the truth.  We would have stayed and tried to enjoy our meal if you just hadn't want to come over and argue with us about our meal.  Poor customer service, overpriced food for the quality and long waits just aren't worth it.  I would avoid this restaurant.",

The food was delicious! Homemade crab cakes, vegetables, garlic potatoes, stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon, steak tips... I enjoyed it all. Our waitress Tracy was very attentive and gave us everything we needed (napkins and condiments) without us having to ask. The location was not too far from our hotel.

Add to that this looked nothing like a New York strip but more like a old piece of shoe leather.   I can eat and enjoy some not so good food but this steak would have been bad if it came off of a lunch truck yet alone a Steakhouse. First time in my life I left half a steak on my plate.  Note: The staff are very nice.",

We were created very nicely and seated right away. I ordered the shrimp wrap in pita bread that was far see with tomatoes, onion, cheese, and their tiki sauce. It also came with large steak fries and a tiny cup of slaw with a dill wedge on top. The salmon was slightly over old and not really seasoned but the sandwich was filling. I had a little extra sauce to come because of the dry meat. The fried needed salt but they camera. T. T. T  hot. Even though the slaw was just a spoonful I didn't care for it because it had pickles in it. Yuk. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. I gave it a three because there was nothing special about this place. The prices were reasonable and the food filling. I would not return unless I was in the area and needed food to just fill me up. Bojangles is within walking distance anyway.",

I should have just ordered a steak for dinner but wanted to try some east Carolina BBQ. I could only eat 1/3 of it. The meat was greasy and oily and was not anything close to BBQ. It actually was shaped like a large patty on my plate...awful. The baked beans and coleslaw were just as bad. My buddy ordered the filet mignon and did not care for it either. He did like the nachos appetizer though. I would not go back to this place.",

We usually get the prime rib special and noticed that the price went up but the size stayed the same. On the last two visits we ordered it and asked for it to be medium, it was not even close to medium and the meat was lukewarm. This was the second time that we experienced the poor quality of the meat so we won't be spending anymore money eating there. We also noticed that there are hardly anyone eating in the restaurant so I guess that's why.",

Warmed bread was brought to the table before salads, so everyone had something to munch on.  Our entrees consisted from huge burger, filet, sirloin, steak tips, prime rib with lobster tail. Everyone said their meat was cook just the way they liked it.  We all talked and eat at our pace, never pushed to leave. Server continued to refresh drinks, and clear plates as we finished. We were there for 2 1/2 hours talking and catching up.  The only thing I saw was one of the table bus girls kept walking by giving us the eye. Guess she was wanting to clean our table and go home.

They don't know if they want to be a steakhouse  or a bar or a club. The waitstaff seems friendly but there is a lot of arguing going on behind the scenes you can see it spilling over into the dining area. The service is slow. The food is slow. None of the food they came out of the kitchen was hot. Even after I explained of this to the waitress she explained that some things from the kitchen weren't going to be that warm. In the end it was a very expensive dinner. I had to find someone to take my money because our waitress had disappeared for about 20 minutes and never come back to the table after dropping off the check . The manager who took the money didn't seem very happy about it. Will never be going back to this place again. It's just bad and how they stay open I do not understand.",

The steak was cooked as ordered, but it was impossible to taste the steak. I was looking forward to the crab, but there was none!  It didn't even have a crab flavor, imitation or otherwise!   The steak was overwhelmed by the flavor of the sweetened sweet potatoes that it was served over.  The \"potato leaves\" did little to garnish the dish.  The cheesecake was plain, and taste was fair at best.  The sauteed mushrooms tasted like old grease.  If you want a steak, go to Texas Roadhouse.",

Ample parking (which we appreciated after a day spent downtown), we went on Friday night and they weren't too busy. We were seated right away.   They have a good menu selection, pretty typical of a steakhouse. We started with an order of cheese fries as our appetizer. Nothing crazy with this, just steak fries with Jack and cheddar melted on top. It was a little too overdone for my tastes, we only ate about half of it. Hubby got the Caesar as a side and I had the house salad. Both were fresh and a good size for sides. The blue cheese dressing on mine was on point. Hubby ordered the 9 oz. sirloin with garlic mashed potatoes on the side, while I had the  6 oz filet with sauteed spinach. His steak was cooked perfectly rare, though the mashers were dry. Luckily there was butter on the table so that helped. My steak was a little under the mid-rare that I ordered, but it was filet, so what the heck. Very tasty anyway. The spinach was nice - sauteed with garlic, though the garlic was a little raw tasting. I don't mind that, but some might find that off putting. The kid ordered a cheeseburger off the kids menu and it was phenomenal!  Huge and juicy, he ate it all!  With a glass of wine and a mixed drink, we got out of there for about $70. Not bad. It's a pretty place, the bar area is huge!  We'd go again if we were in that part of town. Next time I'd definitely order a burger - it was that good!",

Our waitress was fantastic, I can't remember her name but she was so kind and accommodating it was like we were in her home eating. She checked on us and served us with such ease. It was awesome.   I liked the amount of options that this restaurant offered and the fact a there are quite a few lunch specials daily. After a quick review of the menu, I decided to go with their special which was a chicken taco salad in a tortilla shell, with corn, black beans, pico and cheese with your choice of dressing. The salad was huge and there was plenty of chicken to keep me full! My co-workers all ordered something different and everything on the table looked so good.  We were in and out in no time, so I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal, you have a hungry group of people that all want something different and you want to pay a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "Sorry, but this is clearly \"old people food\" -- everything poorly seasoned and half-assed.  I made the observation that bad steakhouses always have bad knives too, which makes it just more apparent that a restaurant selling a $20 steak has access to lower-quality beef than your average consumer as you sit there trying to buzz saw your way through the gristly bits.  I'm certainly my strip wasn't USDA choice (let alone \"prime,\" places will put that in the name to give people who know what it means a good laugh) because I've never struggled more to work my through a New York strip.  I had the special consisting of a NY strip (and trust me, \"old\" NY strip doesn't automatically turn tough and miserable, it gets better--this was just bad quality meat)  with peppercorn sauce, shrimp, and two sides.  The steak itself had no discernible seasoning layer and had anemic grill marks.  I could do better on a teflon pan, some kosher salt, and a pepper grinder.    The peppercorn sauce had zero flavor, just a fatty insipid liquid, and no visible cracked or whole peppercorns.  Trust, peppercorns are delicious, they soften up, and absolutely belong in a peppercorn sauce.  Clearly they had blessed the sauce with a few shakes from a disposable peppershaker but the sauce tasted like failure and missed opportunity.  They recommended sauteed spinach which I can eat all day.  I'm eating some right now that took me 3 minutes to make using the same pan as the $4 sirloin I picked up at the grocery store, which is killing that NY strip I had.  No hint of seasoning, no garlic chunks, just some watery spinach that had been clearly sitting in a steam table.  Seriously, sauteed spinach is a great thing and the idea is that you sautee it to order, and it takes all of 3 minutes, and if you're not serving it to grandma, you load it up with sauteed garlic and salt and pepper, you make that spinach pop, it is delicious.  Not here.  All said and done, I suspect everything on the menu should come down by 1/3 in price and drop \"prime\" from the name.  On par with Lone Star, Bonanza, Sizzler, etc.  Why don't these places know you can make amazing steaks with a hot cast iron or stainless pan?  They always manage to completely botch a good seasoned layer of steaky goodness.",

Full on southern style meals.  More food that you should eat really.  My most recent visit, I got the Marinated London Broil (11.99, big spender) and it was really really good.  Perfectly cooked.  The sides were excellent as well.  The service was good.  Atmosphere is a little stuffy for me, with white table clothes, ect.  But that's the vibe they want.  I have a feeling that paying dinner prices, I would be less impressed, but for lunch it is very good.",

Our waitress seemed distracted and didn't really check on us, and kind of rushed us out despite the place being seemingly slow.   Steak was decent, sides were average, atmosphere lacking. I just expected more. Nothing to really draw me back. My friend was also disappointed with his steak too. Over seasoned, a little burnt, fries were decent, but those are hard to mess up...   Maybe it was an off night, but I don't think I'll be back. But won't tell you not to try it for yourself.",

Waitress did not ask what temperature I wanted my steak and and it was served to me raw - like my steak was still purple red. We had to wait another 10 minutes before we could even find a server, not even our waitress, to tell them about my steak. The second try was still half raw and the owner argued with me about the cook on a medium rare steak. I ordered one glass of wine and after 15 minutes, asked the waitress if she got my original request. Waitress said they were slow because there was only one bartender - on a busy Saturday night. In our 1.5 hour visit, we never got a refill. And the table beside us, who came after us, got their food almost right after us and were ready to go when we were, also never got refills. As a former waitress, I understand the challenges of a busy night but at least one refill is basic waitressing 101.  Food was nothing special, but the experience left even less to be desired.

I opted for a grilled chicken dish that was served over the most delicious rice.   For my sides, I had a tossed salad (heavy on the iceberg lettuce) and cinnamon apples.  Of everything I had, the apples were the best!  My chicken dish was good, but the chicken was a little bit dry. I ordered it blackened and it wasn't what I considered truly blackened. It seemed to have been rubbed with various seasoning salts, but not really blacked.   I loved our service!  The server at our large round table was totally efficient and got all the food out quickly. She kept checking back and had no trouble separating the individual checks.  I was very impressed by how she handled the group.  The restaurant was pleasant. It had several different large spaces and I would totally recommend this restaurant as a great place for large groups.   I can't believe I hadn't been here in all the years that I have lived in Charlotte. I had just never noticed it as an option.  I am eager to take some family members here.   My mother would love to sink her teeth in a big juicy steak. I need to make that happen soon!",

The chicken was okay. The sauce was just slightly better than ok. The cinnamon apples were totally flavorless. The ranch dressing had less flavor than a bottle of Ken's, on an iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots, 1 grape tomato, with tastes-like-shredded-plastic shredded cheese \"salad\". Even the bread that proceeded the meal was bad. Just totally lacking flavor and so hard it could easily rip up the roof of your mouth . My husband had prime rib with overly oily spinach that he couldn't even stomach. He said the steak wasn't good, either. I will say that our server, Jasmine, was really good.",

    "text": "Had dinner with a friend last night. We both ordered the prime rib special. She ordered medium, I ordered medium rare.  Mine was cooked way beyond medium rare. I sent the prime rib back. I kept my baked potato...I had already opened numerous tiny packets of butter and had it just the way I like it. The server returned to tell me they were cooking me another prime rib and it would be a few minutes. When the server brought it out she said they dipped it in au jus to warm it up, which I thought was an odd comment until I tried it. The prime rib was not medium rare, it was medium but I said I would take it anyway as I wanted to eat my meat with my potato. I thought the first couple of bites were a bit cool for a medium prime rib that had just been cooked. When I ate a piece of the fat, it was cold...not cool. Refrigerator cold. The server's comment made sense then. They took a cold, I am assuming leftover, piece of meat and dipped it in warm au jus to heat it. So much for the prime rib special. My dog loved it.  The rest of the meal was fine. The hot bread was delicious. Loved the baked potato, though I wish they had a better system for butter than the tiny packets. My friend said her salad was very good. The service was okay. I may go back, but I'd stick with a ribeye...better chance of it being freshly cooked.",

As I got up to retrieve the drinks myself, I spotted the waitress as she was heading toward the bar. Hurray, we finally got our drinks. We never saw her again. 15 minutes later a different waitress showed up to take our food order. I had the 9 oz filet mignon with a salad and garlic mashed potatoes. (The second waitress at least showed up at the table, but had no understanding of attentiveness toward customer needs.) The salad was fresh, the French and blue cheese dressings were both delicious (uncertain if they were homemade dressings). The steak was cooked medium rare, just as I like it. It was a nice size steak. The mashed potatoes were so so, not a lot of flavor. Summary: Although the food is alright, the management needs to train their staff of the benefits to customer service (i.e .great service = great tips).",

    "text": "Saturday Lunch with Susan while shopping for bathroom fixtures.  We are doing an unplanned bathroom and office remodel after the toilet in the master batch sprang a leak and over about 12 hours, saturated the floor which in turn leaked down into my office downstairs.  Trying to dry out my office is the main reason I have not been on Yelp as much lately because trying to post from a tablet is a challenge.  It's a rather nondescript restaurant, at least on the outside on Woodlawn Road just east of I-77.  I had read some very good reviews however that prompted my to want to give it a try.  Drove down for our last stop in Huntersville and got there around 11:45.  Walked in and were promptly seated and presented with breakfast menu's even though it was just before noon. We asked for lunch menu's which were promptly produced.  Interesting menu but basically a typical meat and two restaurant that were so popular in years past.  My wife order the Steakhouse salad which was impressive in size and presentation although my wife did indicate that the steak was overcook and rather thin.  I started with a House Side Salad that was very good and for my entree I ordered the two Pork Chops and a side of baked beans.   Pork Chops were on the thin side but still moist and not dried out.  Baked Beans unfortunately  could have used something like Brown Sugar, Molasses Onion, Bacon Bits to give some texture and flavor.  Inside decor is very interesting and a through back to the period from 1970 to the mid 90's.  It was very tastefully done.  Our server was excellent and we did not want for anything the entire time we were there.  We defiantly be back.",

    "text": "We had the hankering for a steak, but not just any steak.  We wanted one that was tender, juicy, well-seasoned and seared to a perfect medium temperature.  But... in Charlotte, that generally means you are going to shell out $100/person and we didn't want to spend that or conform to the formal atmosphere that comes with that price tag.  So we scoured Yelp reviews of lower cost steakhouses and decided to give Carolina Prime a try.   To start, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  It came out piping hot, oozing with melted cheese on top.  There were plenty of artichoke chunks mixed in but the texture was still a creamy goodness.  There was more than enough to share for an $8 appetizer.   Moving on to our entree... the hubby and I decided to split the 9oz Carolina Prime Filet.  OMG, sweet Jesus, that filet was divine!  And it was only $29!  I paired mine with a baked potato and he got the garlic mashed potatoes and both of us were in our own little heaven while we devoured them.  We also ordered the $8 scallop sidekick to pair with our entree.  Again, the scallops were perfectly cooked, and there wasn't a single gritty bit of sand left in them.  If I had one complaint, it is that they could have used more salt and pepper, but I'm well aware that I may just prefer my scallops a bit more seasoned than some.    We also enjoyed a couple of Jack & Coke's for which they charged $7.50/mixed drink, which I felt was a reasonable price.  All and all, I'm definitely coming back here again. Did I mention how friendly and attentive our waitress was?  The service & the food are outstanding!  Now, I have to say, the decor is a bit outdated (the 80's called and want their mauve-colored walls back), but honestly, that won't keep me from coming here again.  The next time I'm craving a steak, I'm heading to Carolina Prime!",

With dark wood, antiques, and oldies playing it's got an old feel to it in a good way. We went on a Thursday for dinner and pretty much had the place to ourselves. We ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and a burger which came out super fast. The sandwiches we ordered were quite good. The server was very friendly and had everything thing we needed. We didn't have to ask for anything. Highly recommend!",

This is the type of place that looks like it's been around for while and probably has a rush right before 5 p.m. We were able to get a group of 25 accommodated on a Saturday night and even then they didn't seem that busy.  The interior seems a little outdated. We did appreciate the ship decor since we were pirates, but it didn't make sense.   The menu had a variety of items. We had cheese fries to start. They were decent. The fries were a thick cut and came out on a sizzling plate. The cheese was just melted on top. They were a little bland for me. I also had the Mediterranean pasta which came with a side salad. The pasta was good. It had spinach, artichokes and tomatoes in a lemon sauce over penne. The penne was a little over cooked. The vegetables were good, but the artichokes overpowered everything. I wish some feta and kalamata olives were added to the dish. The salad was basic, but the Greek dressing was yummy.   Service was okay. Refills seemed a little slow. I did appreciate that the food came out in order and they didn't have to shout every order to see who's it was.   We had a good time, but I  just wasn't impressed. I've heard lunch time is decent too.",

    "text": "Sometimes, there are just some places that escape my review list and this was one of them. I swore I wrote a review and also added pictures for this restaurant, but it seems like it disappeared? Or have I just written so many reviews that sometimes some slip through my radar and I thought I wrote a review, but didn't? For the fact, I've been here I believe 3 times and this past weekend was the most recent. I've had their burger, and prime special breakfast along with tastings of the prime rib and pork chops. The pork chops are one of my parents' favorites.  Anyways, this one will be simple. Carolina Prime Restaurant & Steakhouse is a favorite for my parents because well they serve good meat/steaks for brunch and also overall serve good food. Inside, it's a rodeo. It's basically old school kind of steak house and there's booths everywhere. There is a bar area where you can sit and drink and have televisions lined up.   The menu is pretty straight forward. Except for the fact that I read one incorrectly. The first time I came I looked at their Carolina Prime Special Breakfast and got confused when I read the description: \"Two Eggs, any style, with Pork Sausage, Bacon, Livermush, Link Sausage / Turkey Sausage or Turkey Bacon, Hash Brown Potatoes, Home Fries or Grits, Toast or Biscuit.\" So does this mean that My two eggs comes with pork sausage, bacon, livermush, (my choice of link or turkey sausage or turkey bacon), hash brown potatoes, (my choice of home fries or grits), and (my choice of toast or biscuit)??! That's a lot of meat and options on that plate (was what ran through my mind). And ultimately that's what I got.  Sadly. That's not what I got. This is what I got... Just turkey bacon, because that's what I saw and thought those were my choices. I think it should probably read like \"with ONE or TWO of these options:\" That would've cleared everything up. Grammar is important! Anyways, if you're like me, you want to watch out.  The food was good, however on the third visit the burger was a little overcooked for a medium rare. But it was medium, so I don't really mind. I didn't have any problems and the service was good. Definitely a good brunch spot for us, and will probably come back as long as my parents are enjoying themselves.",

    "text": "I need to begin by saying when I walk into a place and I set my arms down on the table and it's sticky, you could serve Kobe beef for $5 and I'd still give it a bad rating.  Not the cleanest of places and just needs some serious elbow grease. For the food , $100 for 3 people is not bad if the food is good but this place just doesn't meet those standards. The steak was cooked to my liking and pretty good but not that special. I had garlic mashed potatoes as a side. The potatoes were real but the garlic flavor was not a good taste. Should have taken the clue from the parking lot at 6 pm being nearly empty. I wouldn't go here again.  Service was good though.",

    "text": "Went last night looking for steak and wanting someplace different.   The restaurant was very clean and the bar and dining room are well separated, there's a half nautical half hunting lodge theme.   The hostess was extemely friendly and nice as was the waitress.   I ordered the ribeye which I felt was cooked perfectly and was well prepared and left the steak with a great taste. The garlic mashed potatoes were dry but that seems to be a theme in the south lol.   My wife enjoyed a t bone and the kids meals were sirloin, grilled cheese, and a cheeseburger. The sirloin was kids size and the rest was definitely a decent serving, good enough for an adult.   The waitress then took a few extra minutes to help my daughters get ketchup from the bottle and get it on their fries.   The desserts were delicious and decent size, we ordered the fudge brownie dessert for the kids which 1 was enough for the 3 to share.   Definitely recommend.",

For the price of premium items on the menu, like coconut crusted shrimp and fillet tips, this place is a great low key date spot or a steak night with carnivorous friends.  Of course vegetarians might not be too happy but everyone else will.",

The food is excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the service is fantastic. My only ultra minor complaint is that I ordered a classic martini and it was a little warm, so next time I will make sure to ask for a chilled one. If I lived closer, I would come here on a weekly basis.",

    "text": "Surprisingly bad.  No other way around it. Seated at 7pm on a Saturday night.  The place was essentially empty. 1. My wife wanted the prime rib special but was only offered the 12 or 16oz size choice.  She ordered the 12 and then we found out on the bill that the special was 10oz.  We would have ordered that for $12 instead of the $22 we were charged.  2. The rest of the party ordered a sirloin medium, a sirloin medium rare, and I ordered the 14 oz ribeye, med rare.  The medium sirloin was fine.  The ribeye was scorched on the outside and purple/ rare throughout most of the cut.  I sent it back and it was returned well done. 3. The other sirloin was the worst cut of meat I had ever seen.  It was not a steak so much as the end piece of something.  It was full of tendon and gristle.  It was also barely introduced to the grill so it was purple and soft throughout. It was seared at best. The person did his best with it, but finally gave up and just ate bread.  4. The staff seemed overwhelmed in spite of the fact that I only saw three tables of people. They were slow on drinks and we finally had to walk back to the kitchen to find some condiments.  Overall, it was nothing like what we expected. I was told it was a cut above Outback, which was about what we wanted, but Outback would have been much, much better... and that is saying something!",
