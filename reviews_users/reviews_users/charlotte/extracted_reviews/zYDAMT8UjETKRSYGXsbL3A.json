The food is certainly reasonably priced. And myself being a bit temporarily handicapped the staff help carry my meal out to the car for me what wonderful people.",

The best item was our first which was the Chinese Dumplings or Pot Stickers, which were just steamed but filled with a very good pork and cabbage mixture. There was a few of us so we had a couple of different dishes. We had the Beef Chow Fun, with the big flat noodles, Not tasty and not good. We ordered the Beef and Broccoli, which had a lot more flavor that the Beef Chow fun but nothing out of the ordinary. We also had General Tso's Chicken which had some flavor but was fried way to crisp to chew. My favorite dish to try everywhere is the Singapore Rice Noodles, usually with a great Curry flavored sauce and chicken, shrimp and tofu. This came with some okay Chicken, Very dry noodles, no Curry taste at all. The shrimp were scarce and the tofu rubbery. I did not like it at all. I went because people have reviewed it and said it was great and authentic, I will give it another chance but this was not a good first impression.",

If you go in wanting the usual Panda Express stuff you will be missing out (but I think they do those stuff pretty well too - I haven't tried any sesame chicken etc etc so I don't know) but the \"real\" dishes are top notch - the roast duck, bbq roast pork (I think this could be good entry-level dish if you haven't had authentic Chinese ever this is NOT normal western BBQ though)  if you had calamari somewhere else you have to try the salt and pepper squid (deep fried it's excellent) beef chow fun (beef with thick noodles cooked dry) is perfect with the char-taste from a hot wok and no ubiquitous brown sauce in sight. Great authentic dishes we love- pork belly with preserved vegetable, chicken-eggplant and salty fish clay pot (so good with white rice), pigs ear with chili sauce and the tripe with 5 spice - both comes chilled and excellent. I have been eyeing the fish and need to order a fish dish next time... they have a special list in Chinese - the waitresses will gladly translate - it usually contains fresh-seasonal vegetables, fresh seafood, and seasonal specialties like sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf....  it's such a treat to have them around!!!",

Our food came out promptly and you can tell it was fresh out of the kitchen. Everything we ordered was beyond delicious! The portions are huge so we had lots of left overs for another family meal. Definitely on my hubby and my \"A\" list of places to eat around Charlotte! Go check them out and see for yourself. Here's what we ordered: 1. Crab Rangoon $5 for 6 2. Crispy Fried Shrimp Ball $8 for 4 (kids fave) 3. Beef brisket Noodle Soup $10 (hubby's fave) 4. Black Pepper Steak $16 (hubby's fave) 5. Chinese Style Fried Rice $12 (kids fave) 6. Salt and Spice Pork Chop $15 7. Eggplant in garlic sauce $12 8. Soft Shell Crab Hong Kong Style $16 (my fave) 9. Honey Roasted Pork $12  10. Steamed Lobster with Sticky Rice $45 (my fave)",

Only major drawback is too lil seating. But, why is it that lil restaurants w/lil seating are always line intense w/customers waiting? Just like in Hawaii! But, in Hawaii, it means the food is super ono enuf for u to suffer the wait.",

    "text": "Authentic Chinese food with great flavors. Will definitely try the entire menu. Small cozy space, not too many seats, but the food will liven your tastebuds. So why the dropped star. Value proposition is a bit lacking. They charge similar prices to Lee Cafe or Chuan Wang Fu, but you get half the portion size. If they work on giving you a bit more bang for your buck, I'd give them 5 stars. But with the limited seating, and smaller turn over ability, I can understand why they squeeze every dish, since they can only serve up so many each day.  Also, hard pass on their \"lobster\" dishes. You don't even get a full lobster tail for the price they charge you.  Give it a try, definitely a different offering than your other two Szechuan \"Charlotte\" offerings.",

One table arrived later than my table and this other couple's table. And that table got all of their food within maybe 10 minutes. While my table and the couple's table waited for 45+ minutes, our food still hadn't arrived. At least for my table, we finally got our food because we yelled at them to hurry up since we had already been waiting for a very long time. But the couple continued waiting, and while every table had food, they had nothing. Only their beverages. While eating my meal, my whole family and I were very upset because we felt it was so unfair to the couple that they still didn't have their food. They were patient enough to wait for an hour, but their food still didn't arrive. Not even one dish. So they left and their time was wasted. This is so unfair and nobody deserves to go through this. Even though this restaurant's food was very good, they don't know how to treat people with respect. This is disgusting and you shouldn't come to this restaurant.",

If you want heavily fried meats and thick sauces, there are lots of other food places.  This is authentic.  I would even suggest it for people who think they don't like Chinese food.  This is s step above.  I had the soft shell crab which came with greens and fresh chili peppers.  The crab was perfectly fried and obviously very fresh.  Portion was generous and price was a steal.  I also had the shrimp balls which were perfect.  Again, very fresh, big shrimp (unlike many other places).  Can't wait to explore other menu items!",

I cannot say with any degree of practical knowledge if this fare is considered great/ good or poor, but on this night the place was filled with an ethnic group clearly familiar with the food and my palate was happy. The average American used to \"Americanized Chinese\" will not likely recognize many of the offerings but fear not and forage ahead, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  We took home Maylasian style chicken curry and Roasted Duck Noodle soup and both were delicious and not at all the oily and greasy concoctions so often offered by other shops.

We ordered the Szechuan dumplings and they were supposed to be very spicy, but they had barely any heat. There was just a lot of oil on the plate which looked nice, but didn't really serve any purpose. The filling inside was very bland as well.   The Beef Shank was just as pretty and just as meh.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and it looked amazing. I started to eat it and I'm not sure how the chicken was prepared, but it had a sort of gooey coating around it and it was very chewy. I took two bites of it and couldn't bring myself to finish it. It was also very disappointing because I again expected heat and got none. The fried rice wasn't bad, though.  As I said, the service was fine, but it was definitely not worth the almost 45 minute drive. There are much better options available, in my opinion.",

The only downfall to this restaurant is the fact that it takes forever to get your food. If you are making a to go order it is imperative that you call ahead and place your order because it may or may not be ready when you get there. I've been wanting to try the lobster for awhile now but every time that I go they never have it which sucks but hopefully one day they will have it and I will get the chance to try it. The food is ALWAYS delicious and you can tell that it is authentic. I would recommend this place to anyone!",

Flavor was a little bit odd. What I taste it was ginger, spicy and bitter flavor but the meat  was very bland and needed salt.  The beef chow fun was good. Nice thick noodles with tender beef and bean sprouts. I will try the seafood chow fun next time.   The stir-fry green beans came with minced pork.  very flavorful. Definitely recommend it for vegetable dish.   The best dish was the salty and spicy prawns. This is the best one we've had in Charlotte area. The prawns come with the heads and you eat everything. It was nice and crispy and flavor was spot on. Same as salt and pepper shrimps. Whole shrimps crispy fried and then sauteed with garlic, salt, and black peppers.  I recommend coming here. I do not recommend trying the clay pot dishes unless you are used to the flavors. Worth the drive.",

I was also reassured by the fact that it appeared as though we were the only non-Asians in the house. That's always a good sign if you are eating that particular cuisine.  On to the food and drinks (or lack thereof). That's right, no beer. Would it kill them to have a cooler of Tsingtao? Oh well, the water was good. We ordered crab rangoon. Yum! Nicely fried shell around delicious cream cheesy crabby goodness.  For the entrees we shared the eggplant with vegetables and the general tso's chicken. Both were unique and flavorful and we both had enough to take home for lunch the next day. I can't wait to try something else.",

Their staff is always friendly and their dishes are freshly made unlike most Chinese restaurants. Since the restaurant itself is pretty small you can see into the kitchen and can clearly tell they cook your food fresh right after you order. It's what makes their food super fresh, flavorful and authentic.   I've been here many times and I would say my favorite dishes are the Sweet and Sour Pork + any of their Claypot dishes (especially with eggplant). They also don't charge extra for rice or refills on the rice unlike most Chinese restaurants. Their prices are also reasonable to their portions.   Honestly, I don't think there is a better restaurant in the Charlotte area that has more delicious and truly authentic Chinese cuisine. The restaurant is very small and has limited seating so make sure to account for that if you are planning to eat here on busy nights. With the sheer authenticity and freshness of their food, I honestly thought the restaurant would be more popular by now. But at the same time, I'm selfish and love that I can always come here on a Friday night and taste an authentic home cooked Chinese meal without too much of a wait.",

The smell of the garlic and spices wafting in from the kitchen really got my excited for what I was about to eat. We ordered the mapo tofu and the chow fun with mushrooms. Not only was the chow fun perfectly cooked and delicious, but the mapo tofu rivaled what I had when I visited Japan. It's a bit pricey, but the portions are generous, and it served family style (large bowls with big spoons that you can use to portion what you want onto your individual plate). I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area. Soooo goooood!",

I've never had such authentic Chinese cuisine I will never eat anywhere else unless I actually go to China. Now it is small and located next to the Harris teeter but I would also recommend calling ahead and picking up since they do take a bit to make the food right. We had the sticky rice lobster which was great, the Szechuan dumplings, egg rolls and don't even get me started on the general tsos chicken. The chicken was cooked perfect very tender and moist. Wow. We will be back I am so impressed. Another thing we found interesting is that the menu offered jellyfish. May try this.",

Lam's Kitchen is literally one of the two-three Chinese restaurants in Charlotte that serve legitimate Chinese cuisine. My family frequents this place just about once a week and are always here for family dinners! Sadly, our Asian cuisine is very lacking in this city still! Some of my favorite dishes include their mushroom hotpot, lobster with vermicelli, beef ho-fun, and any fresh veggies they've got that day. Lam's does not take reservations and can get very busy on the weekends.",

But then, when the time comes to insert food in mouth, the chow best be delicious! I drove 40 minutes to give this restaurant a try. Do I think it was worth it? Unfortunately, not.  The chow:  Szechuan Dumplings- zero flavor, zero heat, zero numbness. Szechuan is know for their extremely spicy peppers and numbing peppercorns. I guess they weren't invited to the party. The shrimp and chicken inside these dumplings were not seasoned. The oil was red, but not spicy. I had to drown my dumplings in soy sauce to experience some sort of flavor.  Beef Shank App-covered in the same oil as the Szechuan dumplings, same topping, same disappointment.  Kung Poa Chicken-my friend ordered this dish, took one bite, and didn't touch it again. The so-called chicken was minced small like the peanuts,  had this weird soft coating around it, had an awkward chewiness, and tasted nothing like chicken. The fear factor went up a notch.  Flat Noodle Dish w/ Shrimp-decent wok flavor. This saved the meal for me.  If you want to try more authentic Szechuan food, check out Chuan Wang Fu and ask for the \"other menu.\" You'll then discover why Lam's is not winning with me. Peace.",

It'd be nice if the space was bigger so you can bring more people and order more food, you know what I mean?  We ordered a conglomeration of foods ranging from the Lobster in Sticky Rice (special) to Salted Fish in the clay pot. The food was not excessively salty like many other Chinese places. The sticky rice was phenomenal, full of fish eggs mixed within the rice. We also ordered Chow Fun, Hong Kong style lobster and crab, string beans, and fried rice. They do put a lot of green onion and pepper on the lobster and crab and the portion of seafood can be small for a big party, however it's worth getting! The batter could use a little more seasoning.   The staff was SO kind, there may have been a slight language barrier, but they will take the time to understand you and accommodate.",

And more importantly, the string of tasty eats in this strip mall continues, so even if you do not like Chinese, check it out because there are plenty of options here.  At any rate - due to the Chinese New Year, we thought we would go for some authentic food, and luckily we arrived just before the rush, since there are not many places to sit in this small spot. We were literally the last two seats in the place - and there were plenty who showed up after us that decided it just wasn't worth waiting. Now I am not saying the food isn't, just that the small space was too crowded.  As to the food, it can be a bit hit or miss. But the service is spot on. And you won't get anything like this at Manchu Wok. As with most items, there are some that are better than others, so you might have to search the menu a little, but it's definitely worthwhile to try and find something to your liking. We were actually eyeing the lobster next to us on our way out. I think we'll have to try that one soon...",

The place is very small with maybe about 20 seats inside and 3-4 tables outside. Although, it was too cold for outside dining. Took about 40 minutes to get a label for us 7. We had a little of everything. Cold chicken was ok but definitely better with the ginger sauce but you'd have to ask for it. The lobster was delicious but some pieces were hard to crack open. Seemed like too much work. The fried rice was good. Very aromatic. Our least favorite was the jelly fish. It was just different from what we've had. It's a unique texture and flavor. The intestines were different and not as crispy as we had hoped for. The best dish was the salt and pepper prawns (head on). They were perfectly seasoned and fried to a nice crisp. I would definitely go back for the prawns. The service was good. They were friendly and accommodating. BYOB.",
