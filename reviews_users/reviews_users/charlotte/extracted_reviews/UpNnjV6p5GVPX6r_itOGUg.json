Our first mistake was coming in with a big group, I thought the space was bigger so MAKE A RESERVATION if you have a large party. We arrived on a Sunday night and they were packed! We waited for about an hour before they were able to fit us in. I ordered the Thai ice tea, and shrimp kao soy. The Thai ice tea was fairly good, but it was a little sweet for my taste. Omg where do I even start with the food. It was SO salty, the broth was so salty I couldn't even drink it. But it wasn't even my dish, the whole group complained that all their dishes were way overly salted. I even tried the drunken noodles, and the snapper both were salty as well. So disappointing because the salt really overtake the flavorful dishes! I don't know if the chef had an off night or are the dishes suppose to taste like this but for $16 a dish I expected a lot better.",

I always hate when Thai restaurants skimp you on the chicken/rice, this is not the case with Rai Lay. Also, instead of sliced chicken they use ground up chicken. In my opinion I like it a lot more when it's ground up.   Warning: do not ask for the hottest spice level. It was more painful than enjoyable.",

I ordered the drunken noodles with tofu and my boyfriend got the Kao Soy which he was nice enough to let me taste. The Kao Soy was on the sweeter side and very mild.. a good dish to try if you like pad thai but want something a little less main-stream. My dish came as a level 3 (out of 5 spice), but I lowered it to a level 2 since I can't handle a lot of spice. It turned out to be just right... spicy enough to get a kick, but not to need to chug a glass of water with every bite. Overall, I recommend!",

    "text": "My husband and I found this place on Yelp looking for a good date night spot on short notice. This place was exactly what we were looking for! It's in Southend (which we had never visited) and we really loved the area with locals walking around and tons of stuff going on. It was a really nice atmosphere.   It is a small place but only half the tables were full at 7pm on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately and all of the staff we encountered were very friendly. The service was excellent.   We started out with the Larb Ped - ground duck with tons of spice and flavor. Just a tiny bit gamey but that's duck ;-)  I had the super-sweet Thai Tea to drink which I loved. They mentioned a sake flight for $5 which was not for us but sounded cool.  My husband ordered the Basil Chicken with a 3 star spice level and it was perfect for him, a tad too spicy for me. I had the Kao Soy, spice level 2. It was served in a metal bowl was the most beautiful and flavorful dish. I couldn't stop smelling it! These were both huge portions and we had enough left over for another meal.  We also ordered the Fire Cracker sushi roll which was huge, fresh, and excellent.   It's not cheap but a great little place to take a date or a small group of friends. They also were doing a booming take out business.  Overall it is now on our list of date night options. We will be back!",

The wife and I were joined by a friend for some hopefully spicy Thai dishes, well in my case anyway. We were greeted and seated immediately and we soon had drink on the table. They have craft beers, wine and a full bar to include cocktails and sakes. I wanted to try the larb appetizer which came with ground duck and I ordered it Thai spicy hot. Per our server, they offer spice levels of 1-5 and Thai spicy if you want to bump it up a big more. Overall, the larb was a nice appetizer and the size was certainly generous. It could have been spicier for my tastes but it did have some heat. The crab fried rice was calling my name as soon and I saw it on the menu. Others chose the pad Thai and some sushi as their mains. I did not try the pad Thai, but I can vouch for the sushi being fresh and flavorful. Nothing extraordinary, just basic good sushi. The group also shared the rice pudding dessert which was nice, but probably would not have ordered this on my own since I rarely order dessert. Plus I was full on the generous portion of crab fried rice. I even had some leftover for breakfast the next day and I incorporated some eggs to make a hearty breakfast. Easily, the crab fried rice elevated Rai Lay to a 4 star experience. I will return as long as the crab fried rice is present on the menu.",

We started out with a couple of rolls  and some Thai Fried Beef Jerky. The Fire Cracker roll was really good..Nice size for sharing and delicious! The Beef Jerky was  well flavored but some of the pieces were inedible..way to tough and chewy. Then we ordered the Panther roll...Soft shell crab - which I adore - but alas it was fishy.  We had the Basil Chicken and let me tell you ..it was spicy..only a 2 on a 5 scale but I am a hot eating person and it was very hot..Very delicious..needed perhaps lettuce to wrap it in. Nice size portion also. Our last item was Crab Fried rice. Not fishy but nothing special. I think they will fine tune everything..I would go back and have that Basil Chicken again and try a few other things..that sounded really interesting. The Service- Like I said..especially a great Waitress named Howdy, was fantastic!!",

Needless to say, I'm going to be a frequent customer at this new restaurant!  A friend and I came in around 8:30PM on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't too crowded at this point. The greeters were friendly and promptly sat my friend and I down immediately. The atmosphere was very relaxing and could easily be a great place for a date night.   I tried the Kao Soy based off a recommendations and I was very impressed! The curry and spices mixed well together and the dish was very filling. My friend had the California Rolls, which were just as good as the entree I was having. We had special cocktails and Chinese beers to go along with our meals with the Ruam-Mit for dessert. Altogether, the entire meal was well worth the wait.  Overall, the Thai food and atmosphere made this a great experience for the both of us and I'm excited to come back to try out more dishes in the future!",

    "text": "Came here right after being picked up from CLT (15 mins from the airport).  Before we decided what to order, the server offered us to taste the coconut soup. I loved it! The flavor was exactly what I wanted. So, My friend and I shared the Pad Thai with Chicken & Shrimp (level 1/5 spiciness); it was saucy, tangy, the chicken was tender and juicy. The shrimp was not over cooked. I could eat that every-other-day happily.  And we also got the Tempura Shrimp Roll, the roll it-self was small in size (it had 8pcs, just not overloaded with rice, which is good), but the quality of the rice and tobiko was super. I would've gotten more rolls with sashimi, but my friend isn't a fan, and honestly, we shared the two lunch dishes and it was plenty.  Perfect portions. Would go again next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "At the end of the meal, as I was pouring the rest of my noodles into the to-go container, I became sad. Sad because the amount of leftovers was far smaller than I wanted it to be. This was the only negative part of my experience at Rai Lay. This was our first time here, and we lucked out, arriving at 6:30 on a Sunday and there were still a few tables available. Rai Lay is small, and I can imagine that on a night other than Sunday when it's popular, the space would fill up very fast. The ambiance is dark but relatively casual! Flowers are on the table and waters are served in mason jars.  Thanks to Yelp, I ordered the Kao Soy, and The Lady ordered the Drunken Noodles (spice level adjusted to 2). The waitress had warned me that if I was going out after, I should put a napkin in my shirt because of all the slurping I was getting ready to do. I should've listened (shirt is currently sitting in the wash with spot treatment).  Rai Lay prides itself on serving truly authentic Thai dishes, served the way they would be in Thailand. The Kao Soy came out in a metal bowl with a side of spiced chili oil, and our waitress told me to squeeze the lime and mix it all together. The result was this awesomely sweet, slightly spicy dish that had crispy shallots, an amazing broth, noodles, and marinated chicken. I could not. stop. eating this stuff. Apparently it's almost impossible to find in NC, let alone the US.  The lady's drunken noodles were ordered with Tofu, which soaked up the flavors perfectly. Hers was more savory than mine, with a more soy type taste to it. The Lady was much better about saving her food for leftovers than I was....  I also ordered a Thai Iced Tea, which is a very sweet Chai tea on steroids. Such a great compliment to our dinners. There's a lack of reviews on a lot of the menu items, and I think it's my personal duty to find out just how delicious they are. So, Rai Lay, I'll be back soon.",

I've been back to Rai Lay a dozen times since my first review, and every time I tell myself to branch out... and every time, the kao soy pulls me back in. Pro tip that I had to learn the hard way: don't wear white if you're gonna order it. It has wound up on my shirt and in my hair so many times that I now wear the \"camouflage kao soy dress\" when I go, and I bring a ponytail holder. I'd bring a bathing suit if there was a chance they'd let me dunk myself in it.  Service is still a little iffy (last night our waitress asked if we wanted dessert right after we asked for the check), my silverware had some schmutz on it, and seating is a little tight, but none of these things will deter me from my love.",

I had the waiter who was nice but extremely slow. So slow that the couple next to me got up and just left because they still had not got their drinks after 10 minutes of waiting.  I order the stereotypical  Pad Thai and  I ask for Thai HOT on it. If you know anything about Thai food this should make you boarder-line sweat!   Well they must have read the ticket wrong because after sending it back and getting it again the food still wasn't spicy at all.   The sushi (spicy tuna roll) I wanted to try to give this restaurant the overall benefit of doubt and it was awful. The flavor and texture was inconsistent. I have had store sushi that was better than this sushi :/  I tried the drunken noodles and it did have good flavor . It was a level 3 on scale of 5 as 5 equals the Thai Hot and the drunken noodles were spicer than the Thai Hot Pad Thai.   I may have just went on a bad night or got a inexperience cook , but I really want to like this intimate Thai place.  Overall, with the combination of slow service and bland food I will not be rushing back here.    I recommend a skip and go to Basil or Deejay Thai which far exceed this place and are around the same price point .",

My friend and I started with the Larb which was sort of like a lettuce wrap. We asked for it to be a little spicy, and it sure was! Almost too spicy, so be careful what you ask for! But it was full of flavor and definitely something i've never tried before. I then got the Lad Nar and it was very tasty!! It had lots of vegetables, chicken, noodles all in a thick broth which had great flavor. My friend got Pad Thai which I don't usually like and I really enjoyed hers. She said it wasn't her favorite but she still ate it and liked it! The staff was very friendly and overall I would come back and get the same thing or try something new!",

I usually steer clear of Asian fusion restaraunts because I feel that the dishes lose authenticity when there's combinations of different  influences, but this place is an exception. The thai dishes taste authentic and so flavorful, portions are totally satisfying, and the prices are reasonable. I love the pad kee mao with just vegetables. My boyfriend always orders the pad grapow with chicken and loves it. I've also ordered the sake flight and loved it, the perfect way to try sake if you haven't had it before! The atmosphere is nice and service has never been a problem.   My only critique of this place is that the spice levels can be inconsistent depending on who's cooking that day. I always order 3-star spice level and have gotten really mild and really hot with the same dish. Now I just order it mild and ask for chili sauce so I can adjust it myself.",

    "text": "Been hearing about this restaurant in the trendy SouthEnd and wanted to check it out.  I am a huge fan of Thai food.  What I found is a tight, trendy, urban space that features a glitzy bar, and a smattering of tables for dining. The bar stands out as the highlight of the joint!  Not saying the food wasn't good, because it was.   The space was so tight that every time the door opened, a little blast of cool air could be felt.  And it was s bit noisy when it was fully occupied.   It's funny how tight can feel both cozy and annoying at the same time. This spot  is within walking distance of a lot of the Southend condos and a great option.  If I were a young hot shot, I'd enjoy stopping in here for just a drink at the bar.  The bar and the tightness of the space are the things I'll remember most.   As far as Thai food in Charlotte, I will continue to patronize The Thai House in Pineville, based on the quality of food and the more relaxed and quieter atmosphere there.  Oh, the service that I get at The Thai House also cannot be beat.",

We had the Thai Sausage for an appetizer (as recommended by our server). The sausage was so flavorful and juicy. Served with peanuts...delish!! My husband order Chicken Pad Thai and he loved it and I ordered Pad See Ew (not on the menu) and it was one of the best that I have ever had. My Mom was lucky enough to enjoy my take home leftovers and even she said it was one of the best Asian noodles dishes she has had.    The service was outstanding, Our server was the so friendly and attentive. I could have chatted with her for hours! We were also impressed that the chef make out to check on us to ensure that we were enjoying our meals. Good stuff!!  Rai Lay will surely be our Thai go-to spot when we're in the South Blvd area.",

However, getting 5 star spicy also changed the plumbing in my home and probably the overall pH of my digestive tract. But as the great French explorer Jacques Cousteau once said, \"If one is to blaze new trails, one may roll an ankle or nearly shit one's pants in the process.\" Amazing service, quick seating, great vibe. Thai tea always reminds me of Jupiter. Shoutout to the Neils (Armstrong and deGrasse Tyson). Definitely will be back. \\m/",

    "text": "I tried Rai Lay based on an intriguing article about it in a weekly, Charlotte events publication.  Although I'll give it another try, with friends, I was absolutely not impressed.  However, do not let my review discourage you from trying it out.  Rai Lay calls it's cuisine \"Thai Street Food,\" but from what I can tell, it has more sushi items than actual food you eat on the street in Thailand.  I've been to Thailand a few times, and sushi just isn't something I remember eating off the street.  I also don't remember eating edamame either, although Rai Lay's lunch dishes serve it as a complimentary side (like French Fries, I guess).  That would have been fine, but the edamame was so tough that it took both of my hands to squeeze the peas out.  And, the server tried to take my edamame away before I was even halfway finished trying to ply the peas away from the pods.  Just because it was a chore to eat didn't mean I wanted to give up on it.    In addition, I noted that a simple glass of house Chardonnay is a whopping $9!!  Yikes!    The article I read about Rai Lay characterized it as a place where servers explain the \"street food\" dishes with diners and work with diners on degrees of heat.  Not so during my experience.  I asked my server if the grilled pork salad was hot and spicy, and he said, \"I don't think so.\"   I replied, \"Good, I'll take it if it isn't spicy.\"  When the dish (which was actually quite pretty to look at) arrived, it had a full pepper jetting out from it, and it was littered with pepper flakes.  While the pork was really good, it was so hot that tears were rolling down my cheeks.  The star of the show (something you don't see in everyday Thai restaurants), is sticky rice served in a basket.  Granted, the rice was surrounded in plastic wrap to keep it piping hot (as opposed to a banana leaf), but the concept was nice and different.    The \"Thai Street Food\" concept seems like a gimmick to me in order to get people in the door.  It worked because I went.  But if the menu or the servers don't really indicate the difference between \"Thai Street Food\" and food from other Thai restaurants, then the gimmick could just as well be \"Free Parking.\"  When I visited, it was at a time when only a few other diners were there, so there was no excuse for an experience which I expected would be educational but, instead, was just a little less than ordinary.",

Often times the order gets messed up but i don't blame the restaurant completely bc I'm not up to speed on that app and how it works. But, the food is so so good hence why i get so upset when it's wrong. Bc when it's right, those drunken noodles are so so good! And the thai iced tea yum! It breaks the heat from the spice. Today though is why I wanna shout out this place. Elena, the manager showed up! She handled my problem with ease and a positive outlook and made my order happen. Postmates wasn't allowing me to order my usual for some odd reason and after a few calls in to let them know, I ended up requesting management to help. And she sure did. She made sure I was going to get my drunken noodles and had a plan a and plan b. All to satisfy me! She said order a few things on your end and get it to the total and I'll make the food happen. Customer service at its very very best! Thank you for being a solution seeker and finding a way to make your customer happy!",

When I called to address the situation, I was appalled at how this was handled. \"Emmy\" refused to refund our money or address the situation unless we drove back and appeared at the restaurant in person. That was  very difficult since we have young children at home (hence the delivery order). She refused to refund part of the order that had not been fulfilled over the phone. She continually contradicted herself and was extremely condescending. I told her I would dispute the amount on my credit card, and she sarcastically said \"for an order you picked up?\"  Even though she acknowledged that part of the order was missing. This is absolutely terrible customer service. It should have been addressed in a completely different manner.  Very disappointing.",

We got the spring roll app, which was really good.  Great sweet Thai chili dipping sauce.  For the main course, i had to get the Pad Thai.  It was one of the better one's i've had.  One thing that stuck out to me was they give you chicken and shrimp, instead of making you choose between the two.    My only knock was with our seating. This place is very small and when it's at full capacity, you feel a little crammed in.  Not a huge deal!  I will definitely go back and next time try a noodle bowl and their sushi.",

I had the Kao Soy, which I'd never had before and was absolutely delicious. It's a curry noodle dish that comes in a bowl with rich broth. My wife had the Pad Thai which was excellent, particularly since it was not \"over-sauced\" like it is at so many other Thai restaurants. Will be back!",

There's also a fun Thai iced tea cocktail which I enjoyed.   The seating is very limited, but I have never felt like it got too loud which I appreciate.",

    "text": "In a very rare case, the consistently good reviews for Rai Lay are well-earned. I'm giving four stars solely based on my carry-out experience. I'm sure if I had chosen to dine in, I would've given five.  Whenever it's rainy/dreary outside, an intense Asian food craving kicks in for me. Such was the case the week before Christmas when I found myself in the area after a dentist appointment. I'd bookmarked Rai due to the reviews and was very much looking forward to trying it out.   Rai Lay is in a shopping center with various shops and businesses which is connected to a parking garage in the back. I parked and then made the short walk over. I walked in and was immediately greeted. I let the hostess know that I wanted to place an order to-go. I briefly looked over the menu and then placed my lunch order for drunken noodles with chicken. To note, the hostess told me that the drunken noodles has a set heat level of 3 and that I could request to adjust if I wanted. I decided to keep it at 3 because, in my experience, the heat level has never been that hot.   They have a lunch menu which consists of the same things on their dinner menu just a little cheaper. The inside boats a wall of TVs that were playing a sports game of some sort and cable news coverage.  After about 10ish minutes, my food was delivered right to me and I could feel the heat from the container right through the bag. Once I got home (about 20 minutes later), my food was still piping hot. Major plus! And? HOLY HEAT. ACTUAL HEAT, HALLELUJAH. I was so pleasantly surprised that their heat level actually meant/means something. I enjoy spicy food so let this be a warning to you if you don't: Order a low heat level or you will feel it. The heat level cleared out my sinuses! The flavors of the dish were so flavorful and fresh-tasting thanks to the abundance of vegetables.   I look forward to going back to dine inside and try out their other dishes. I'm a big fan, Rai Lay!",

    "text": "We love this place. My wife and I try to get out to Rai Lay at least a couple times a month. I'm in love with their crab fried rice but they have so many delicious offerings on the menu.  They also have great happy hour deals like half priced sushi and apps if you come at the right time. But any time is the right time for Rai Lay. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The inside is a bit small but it just lends it self to an intimate atmosphere. Intimate enough that you can sometimes hear what the table next to you is talking about. Including a woman who was walking her friend through his divorce by snitching to him about what his estranged wife had been up to. That was a pretty good day.  I always get the Cucumber Crush cocktail. You'd think \"cucumber? why would I drink that?\" but honestly, it's tasty and refreshing. I don't know what white privilege feels like but I'd imagine the refreshing taste of a Cucumber Crush sliding down my throat is the closest I'll ever come to it.  Then menu is one double sided page. Much of it is appetizers and sushi and as of yet I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't delicious. Be careful with the drunken noodle as they are spicy. You will be coughing a bit if you go anything above a 2 on the spice. But see me? I likes it spicy. Spice me up baby! I need to clear up these sinuses anyway.  There is convenient parking in the garage behind Rai Lay and there are also spaces on the street right in front of the building. I don't know how I hadn't heard of this place before but it is worth a trip.   The only down side I can think of is that they don't take the tails of the shrimp when they serve them. I tried to request it but they were like \"That's just how it is cuz.\" And I respect their honesty. I just don't get the shrimp any more but all the food is still worth it.  PS. Learning to love yourself is difficult. But it is rewarding. Don't be too hard on yourself. Learn to accept your flaws and realize that no one should be judged by their worst day. I love you.",

They should call themselves an Asian Bistro instead since they have a little of Japanese food, Thai, and Vietnamese. We only ordered four dishes and everything literally came out one by one. I was staring at my friends eating for about 40 minutes before i even got my food. And it was super salty but the kind waiter saw that I barely ate it and removed it off the tab. Also the Thai tea was more half and half and barely has any tea taste.   Service here was okay, just really slow and they don't seem really organized.",

The drunken noodles were delish! I know my husband likes it a bit spicier but I thought the spice level was perfect for me. My spicy tuna roll was about average but the edamame was fantastic.

I know it wasn't only my dish because I came with a big party, and when 6/8 dishes are oversalted, there is a slight issue. The dishes are genuinely good though, but it's hard to continue eating a dish with too much salt without becoming full from drinking too much water.   Good news though is that the portions are HUGE. I got the the Drunken Noodles and I loved the fact that they loaded that thing with vegetables and large leaves of basil. It really gave it that extra kick of flavor. We also ordered a ton of sushi, which was all very good too. For dessert, we got mango sticky rice. I believe the rice was sweetened, which made the dessert way too sweet with the addition of ice cream on top of coconut sauce. The rice was cooked really well though, chewy and gooey!   We waited for over an hour since the place was way smaller than we expected! If you're with a large party, I wouldn't come on busy weekends.",

They're located right on South Blvd, so the parking can be tricky if you don't find a spot in the front strip of parking spaces.  I ended up finding a spot about a block away(and it was pretty cold and windy).  I had already called my order of crab fried rice in and was very eager to try this very tasty sounding entree.  The inside of the restaurant seemed to be kind of small but cozy.  The crab fried rice was delicious, filled with just the right amount of crab, onions, and scallions, with slices of cucumber and tomato on top(minus the egg) and like a spicy fish sauce.  It was definitely worth the $16 price tag, and the portion size was massive.  I will become a regular here.",

    "text": "After several recommendations and an evening of driving around SouthEnd, looking for something different to eat, I ended up here. I found a parking space right on the street.  Note the door facing the street is not the entrance door. There's a small sign pointing you to the right door but I didn't see that until I was actually inside. Go to the courtyard to the left and you'll see the entrance door.  Inside, it's a small place, similar in size to their sister restaurant Dee Jai on Providence Rd. There's a bar with about 8 seats and that's where I ended up.   The drink menu is on the back of the food menu. I opted for a local beer and a glass of water. For food, I opted for the Tom Kha soup and the Basil Chicken, the latter being my usual dish to test out a Thai restaurant. The Basil Chicken was mentioned to already be ordered at spice level 3 which is supposed to be Hot. I'll be the judge on that.  The soup was flavorful. Loved the coconut lime flavor. There was plenty of chicken. My only complaints is it needed more veggies and it was a tad bit salty.  The Basil chicken was a good sized portion and served with a bowl of rice. I added a little rice to my meal. I'm not a huge rice fan so I appreciate being to add it at my own pace. Stirring around my bowl, there was tons of basil which at many places you get a spring or two. There were a few pepper slices here and there and lots of onion mixed into the ground chicken. Flavors were good and the spice level was on point. My only complaint with this dish was like the soup, it was a bit salty.   So both items had salt issues. Also an IPA did not go well with these two options but that was on me. The service was good. I think it's worth coming back to to try other things on the menu and also to see if the salt issue appears again.",

Pad cha is not on the menu, but thanks to Yelp, we saw a picture and ordered based on looks alone. Rai Lay is thus far the best Thai food I've had in Charlotte. They have an extensive off menu list...... pretty much anything you want, just ask for it.  The pad cha was spicy, made with what tasted like peppercorn, but much stronger. The pad Thai was delicious with generous portions of chicken. Our meals were served piping hot. Had to wait a little bit before actually eating. Our waitress, \"Pooh\" was so very kind and down to Earth. Water was filled by someone else and they did a great job keeping our glasses full. The food was spicy, so I couldn't get enough. I like the pad cha even better than the pad Thai. Highly recommended.",

Service was excellent, our waitress even noted which dishes had fish/oyster sauce for our vegetarian guests. She explained their 1-5 stars rating system and asked how spicy we wanted our meals. After she took our order and brought our food, she checked on us often and was available for extra napkins, water or whatever we needed.   I ordered the tofu drunken noodles but only ate about half since the portion was huge. It made for awesome leftovers, didn't even need to be reheated and tasted great!

After much anticipation, it finally opened and I checked it out about 4 weeks after it opened. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive right away. Unfortunately they took my order wrong and when it arrived incorrectly, they acted as if what I ordered was not on the menu. And by acted I mean that they told me what I ordered didn't exist. .When I physically showed them that it was listed on the menu, they got defensive and then eventually said the kitchen could remake it and start over, but by then I was ok to just try what I had. It was flavorless and overpriced. While the staff was nice, and the atmosphere has potential, I'd recommend to walk a few more blocks and just go to Thai taste. It's so much better, and if they messed up your order (which to date has never happened), they would not make you eat it or feel badly about having it corrected.  I wish them luck but will not be returning.",

I had the Thai basil chicken, which is hard to find on lunch menus at Thai joints in Charlotte - it is usually only offered at dinner (I am guessing because 95% of people in Charlotte order Pad Thai for lunch when going to a Thai restaurant). But Basil Chicken is my favorite Thai dish (well, maybe except for seafood Tom Yum soup). And Rai Lay does an outstanding job at it.  I am a lover of spicy food, but their default of 3/5 stars is perfect. Not too hot, but not too mild. Just enough to get you nose running when you leave, but it was delicious! The guests beside us ordered Kao Soy and it looked equally delicious (I'll get that next time).   And because I love Thai Tea, I decided to have a Thaitini even though it was a work day lunch. I just couldn't resist. It was quite tasty - very similar to the traditional Thai Tea...but with booze included.  I am very happy to have new Thai joint in SouthEnd. I love Thai Taste, but I can only do Pad Thai chicken every so often (their menu is pretty limited at lunch).   Rai Lay is Awesome! Though this spot has seen quite the turnover of restaurants throughout the past 10 years or so, I can't imagine that this place will be going anywhere any time soon.",

I have heard it billed as fusion, which is a little misleading. This is not americanized at all really, its just that there are a couple of dishes that steer a little more Malaysian and Laotian, and they do have sushi which is obviously not Thai. I didn't try the sushi, but it does seem like its there only for broader appeal, and I wish they didn't feel obligated to do it. I'd much rather see the core Thai menu expanded!  We shared a lot of appetizers and sampled eachother's entrees, and several dishes immediately clicked as being VERY True to what I had in Thailand. Really bright, complex flavors. Everything was great. I love some of the other Thai restaurants we have nearby (don't worry TT, I'll never abandon you), but they tend to have similar menus and shy away from ballsier dishes. This is the first that I've seen really attempt, and nail, some of the lesser-known dishes. Nothing is repetitive about the menu, each dish is wildly different from the other.  The cocktail list didn't look that appealing (very simple and sweet sounding) so we went with sake, which is very reasonably priced. Of course there is Singha and Chang beer, which is pretty nostalgic for me too. Service was very friendly and prompt.   I hope Charlotte is ready to embrace this place. I know I'll be going back as often as I can!",

Ordered the Pad Thai for dinner and got the Mango Sticky rice for dessert, both were great. I got the Pad Thai on level 3 spice and it had the perfect amount of heat and spice. The Mango Sticky rice was a great way to finish after the spice from the Pad Thai. The only downside is the place is on the small side so it was a little tight between tables.",

I don't get upset about things like that since I work in a restaurant, but she said she'd be right back to clean it up and never returned to clean it as the water was seeping all over the table. I had to use my napkin and then when she brought my food over, even though my soaking wet napkin was crinkled up at the end of the table didn't ask if she could get me a new one. She was lacking personality and didn't seem to care about us at all. The food was mediocre. I had sushi which was decent. My boyfriend got crab cake fried rice & the beef jerky. He didn't enjoy the fried rice, but did enjoy the beef jerky despite it being really thick and chewy.",

We placed a phone order and the food was ready in less than 15 minutes for pick up! Easy in and out of the restaurant and in no time we were enjoying our yummy food!   I ordered the tofu drunken noodles (spice level 2 out of 3) and my friend ordered the pad thai with chicken (spice level 3 out of 5). We also got the chicken wings, I loved the thai chili flavor! I tried a bite of the pad thai and would recommend this for people who want a basic thai dish. The tofu with the drunken noodles was the perfect texture and I really enjoyed the veggies in the dish.   Side note-the spice of 3 was killer to my taste buds, opened up my sinuses for sure! The spice of the 2 was a little hot, but nothing unbearable. If you do not like spice at all, order a level 1 (or lower?).   Being the indecisive person I am, I couldn't decide of I needed to add spice to my meal. I changed my mind after I had placed the order and they gladly remade my food with a little more spice (2 out of 5)! Super happy with how spicy it turned out and definately would've regretted not calling back!   When I placed my order I saw they had a lunch menu with a few more items on it. My plan is to try out more here, including the lunch only items!",

I visited in the evening, and it was quite dark. Another table had to pull out their phones to read the menu. My friend didn't care for that, but I enjoyed the dark decor. The highlight of the meal, for me, was the crab fried rice. Lightly fried and absolutely delicious. After my sushi roll, I didn't have enough room to finish it all, and took the rest home. So the portion size was great. Even though this is the sister restaurant to Deejai, I can appreciate the difference in menu, even though it's less choices here. I plan to order their fried rice as my future to-go order, along with others in the neighborhood.",

And boy is their food good. I got the kao soy with lowest spice level and it was so hard to stop eating. The only reason I did was because I was so full. The serving size is ginormous so you'll definitely have lunch and dinner for the next day. Even having the lowest spice the spices in the broth naturally have some tingle to them and with each bite the tingle built. It didn't get to the point where I couldn't bare it (I have no tolerance for spicy foods) so I appreciate that aspect. Can't wait to come back and try something else!",

And we've been ready to order but been waiting on you. Just saying.... Anyways I'm giving 4 stars cuz the food was pretty good although the service wasn't. We ordered some rolls with the jerky appetizer and a curry dish. All which were really good I just wished the main dish was spicier. They gave us a spicy sauce on the side which wasn't spicy at all smdh. I'll say that with 2 appetizers the main dish was more than enough for 2",

The kao soy is basically their signature dish and was voted \"best noodle dish in Charlotte\". It really is fantastic. I don't think we can come here again without getting it. My special was good too. The roast duck was nicely cooked and the curry had good spice level.  I can never leave without mango sticky rice, and of course there's is fantastic.

The chicken wings were a little spicy but not unbearable. For happy hour the chicken wings were $4 and the spring rolls were $3.  Elaina, our bartender was great and fast with the drinks. She made awesome suggestions on the happy hour menu. She also remembered that I'm not a fan of spicy foods so my pad Thai had the perfect level of spice!  The bar had a good selection.

Their drinks are very good - I recommend the sweet tea vodka drink - the sangria is very weird and not what you'd expect.

    "text": "Wow! I was so impressed by this place and I just ordered takeout! I feel like all the Pad Thai I've ever had has either been good or bland but still good because it's pretty hard to mess up noodles. This place has CHANGED the way I think. I know that sounds dramatic but this is easily the best Thai I've ever had. Service seemed a little behind but everyone was super friendly and the atmosphere seemed really nice from what I could observe waiting for my food.  10/10 recommend. It did seem a little on the pricier side for noodles, but definitely a \"must visit\". Bookmark now.   Must try specials (specifically the Bang Bang Shrimp app which is AMAZING). Must try Pad Thai. Also great as leftovers if you're into that kind of thing.",

The spice level to choose from is 0-5; I got a 4 and it was just right!  We tried the Red Dragon sushi roll (spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, and fresh tuna on top) for an appetizer and it was delicious.  And of course they have a full list of drinks (cocktails, beer, and wine) and we definitely enjoyed our Pinot Noir with our meal.  The Service was excellent!  Definitely a nice place for a date night or any night out if you are craving Thai food.  (Follow me @foodievida on FB and IG for more foodie adventures).",

You get a free soup, maybe miso soup. It was a nice start to lunch. I saw that they had khao soy which I had on my first visit to Thailand so I was eager to try it out. It was sweet and creamy from the coconut milk. Had a good amount of heat which wasn't bad. It was a big portion so I had about half to take home. I also had the papaya salad but without the fermented crab. It was a small amount. Had a nice crunch to it. It was sweet and had a nice balance with the amount of lime juice. The place is small but has outdoor seating to accommodate more if you are willing to eat in the heat on hot summer days. Wish they were closer to my job, I'd be there every week.",

It wasn't a busy at all when my friend and I came by for a late lunch and the staff was friendly and very efficient. Our food was out within minutes of ordering. The atmosphere is pretty chill and it was very comfortable. Music wasn't too loud and although the setting is pretty open and the location is small, on the other side of the room, you could have a more intimate lunch or dinner. I can see it getting really tight in there during busy hours but with food and great service like that I wouldn't mind. I'll definitely be back soon. And just an FYI, I like spicy food and I got my rice as a four and my lips are still burning. Lol. One last thing, you can make your order as custom as you want my friend wanted no onions and peanuts and they made her order to her liking.",

The first challenge is finding a place to park. Sure, they have spots right in front, but there are like three of them. Usually there are a couple open spots, but they are there for electric cars, and I don't drive one of those. So after figuring out this issue, we headed inside.  Rai Lay is definitely a change from most Thai places - to start, it's a bit more modern. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it's different. No bamboo or other wooden accents. It's also on the small side, so be prepared. And no book of menu items, it's very short. You also have sushi and some Vietnamese selections - so there are not too many Thai selections.  What you will find are some well-presented items, and they are fresh and tasty. Service is good and the staff is friendly. They are perhaps a tad slower than other places, but it's not horrible. Worth a visit, but not quite sure if they would be in my regular rotation just yet.",

I actually enjoy spicy food and order Thai frequently but on the advice from someone who had previously ordered from this place that this dish is inappropriately spicy I went with MILD instead of medium which is what I typically enjoy. When I called to speak with someone I was told by the girl that answered that the manager would call me back. I never got a call back. When I called again 30 minutes later I was told that it is not their fault that the food is extremely spicy rather it was postmates fault and that I would have to talk directly to postmates as if they were the ones who prepared the food. Very rude. BEWARE of ordering from this place!",

As the staff could see me picking at it, I was asked by 3 servers if everything was ok, I finally told the 3rd person it wasn't and that i would have appreciated it if the waitress advised me that the dish was oily and deep fried. She responded that it is not deep fried and she asked if I would return, I said not. She offered to give me a discount. I only ate the mung beans in the dish and had to return to work hungry. She took off 10% so i got off $1.20. That was insulting and not a proper corrective action. I will not return. When my waitress gave me change she noticed my dish picked at and said nothing...My stomach hurts now.",

I ordered an Basil Chicken, which is supposed to come with edamame while you wait for your meal to be prepared. about 20 minutes after I ordered, a lady who wasn't my server came to my table with the meal. Confused, I asked why my edamame didn't come out before the meal. She shrugged it off and didn't ask if I needed anything else. (a spoon for the rice and soy sauce would have been my answer.) 10-15 minutes or so later my server comes back to check on me. Everything was fine...except for the nearly empty glass of water that needed to be refilled. I'm eating a very spicy dish...why wouldn't you refill my water? It takes literally 6 seconds. About 20 minutes before I needed to be back for work I was looking around the restaurant for my server to bring the check. I waited 15 minutes before some other man came to ask if everything was OK. I told him I had been waiting too long for my check so he went to get it. My server eventually came to my table but by then the other man had already taken my card for payment. The now-empty glass of water was still in plain sight to her.  HORRIBLE service, no offer to make me a happy guest regarding the wait time or edamame. NEVER COMING BACK!",

I was driving so I couldn't look at the menu, and Ivy, who answered the phone,  was so kind to entertain my questions and tell me about some dishes.  I ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp only and she suggested the Shaking Beef for my boyfriend.  Both dishes were excellent.  We had a great first impression that left us wanting to go back.",

The favor of the dish is off the noodles are not the thick fresh noodles they used the dry noodles so the favor aren't soaking in.  It's salty and sweet even weird. I'm sure shrimp cost more but for 14+tax you would think you will get more than five shrimps. Well im sorry but the drunken noodle was so confusing.",

We also tried the basil chicken with white rice. So good. Inside is small and contemporary. The music was a bit trendy, kinda EDM, but it worked. Waitstaff was friendly and prompt. We'll be back.",

Great start when they gave us a bottle of Prosecco for a discount when we told them it was national Prosecco day ! So we got two bottles.  Ordered the chicken tom yum soup , told them I wanted it spicy.  It was the best I've ever had, just the right amount of spice and so many flavors, lemongrass and cilantro, absolutely delicious. My two friends ordered the Kao Soy, which was so good, like a soupy yellow curry. Full of noodles, veggies and whatever protein you want. And plenty for leftovers. Will most definitely be back here, just wish it was open Monday's !",

That said, the Pad Thai is also the best I've had. Ask for fresh chopped chilis if you want to kick up the heat even more - great stuff!   Only complaint would be they don't rotate the specials very often - there are a few great ones I've had like green peppercorn chicken, and the chef has made a couple other random off-menu items upon request. More of this for the local Thai enthusiasts please!   Also the free rotating soup at lunch is a nice touch.",

I was not happy with initial searches and decided I would wait till back in NYC before seeking Thai food.   I was wrong. IDK when Rai Lay Thai opened but I'm so happy they did.   The atmosphere is perfect. you can tell your close to the restaurant because the scent and smells are beckoning. Yummy!!! the menu is small and light and the staff is uber friendly.   The space is small and extremely cozy- which reminds me of tasty thai joints up north.  The Thai ice tea was tasty and refreshing and I think this location is definitely adorable for a casual date night.",

A coworker introduced me to RaiLai for lunch and I'm so glad he did.  Walking in, it's a small place but fits a lot of people. Most of the seating is seat for two guests but tables are moveable. They also provide a pretty large sushi bar, again for the size of the restaurant.   They have a great sushi offer during lunch hours, but one get one free. So make sure you order sushi and your entree! My suggestion for the perfect entree is the KAO SOY! Trust me you won't be disappointed. It's so flavorful everything you would want in a great Thai dish.",

I decided on the Pain Killer Saketini and my friend wanted the Classic Saketini with a ginger garnish. Well they were out of some of the ingredients so I had to change my drink choice to the Lycheetini and my friend had to go with the cucumber garnish instead. The drinks were ok.   We also tried the chicken larb (lettuce wraps). Also ok.   It seemed like there were a good amount of customers and to go orders around the dinner hour.   I'm still scratching my head about this...There is a front door on South Blvd that is chained shut with a sign that says to enter through the side door. You have to walk down a few steps to get to the dining area. There is a sign posted at the steps that says not handicapped accessible--please enter through front door.",

The food was so good that we ended up returning with the whole family ro celebrate a birthday a few days later.   I started my meal with pork gyoza and Thai chicken wings. The sauces in this spot are the key to life. The gyoza are perfectly seared and the sauce that accompanies them is perfect. I actually ended up swiping them through the left over sauce from the Thai wings as well. The Moo Ping is so flavorful. Tender marinated grilled pork strips in their Rai Lay sauce and served with sticky rice. Again, the sauce on this dish is incredible. DELICIOUS!!!   Next course we did the Kao Soy which I can best describe as a divine curry noodle soup. Similar to a laksa. When got the Kao Soy with shrimp and there was plenty of large be beautiful shrimp to be had. The curry flavor was authentic and full of depth. It was filled with noodles, cilantro, fried shallots, red onion, pickled mustard, limes and crispy noodles. I loved all the textures. We also had the shaking beef which is easily the best I've ever had and a unique fried rice. The portions are great and it was a perfect balance of colors, textures, aromas and flavors. The perfect meal!  The meal just got progressively better. Dessert was no exception. We ordered Thai crepes and molten lava cake. One of the cooks over heard is saying it was my son's birthday so he surprised us with an additional dessert. The Mango Sticky Rice, which ultimately was out favorite, but they were all delicious.",

It's a very small restaurant, but we were seated right away. The service was very good and our waiter was friendly.   We got there Spicy Basil and the Kao Soy (level 3 spice on both). Both were incredible. The Kao Soy came with a chili oil. I put about half of it in and mixed it up and it added a good amount of spice. The broth was so flavorful. The spicy basil was the perfect amount of spice. I loved that the chicken was more ground and acted kind of like a rice so I didn't really need to add rice to it.   I think this is the best Thai food in Charlotte. It's been flying a little under the radar. I hadn't heard a ton about it, but if you like Thai food, you should definitely check it out!",

For starters I tried the spring rolls and Moo ping. Both were good. Classic flavors and taste. I really enjoyed the sauces for both apps. For dinner, I ordered the Pad Prik at level 5 spicy. Normally, I get asked if I'm sure that I want it spicy (and I always have to smile and say yes I'm sure I like spicy). But that's didn't happen here. And I should have known that I leveled up. Rai Lay does level 5 spicy right. Guys, this dish was extra spicy goodness and I loved it!   The Pad Prik does an excellent job of blending some many flavors together and adding the extra spices just kicks it up. This dish was so good!   If you like your food spicy, this is your place! I'm looking forward to coming back!",

I also tried the Thai Chicken Wings (be warned if heat isn't your thing please as for no heat) the wings were yummy but spicy for my taste. My experience there was nothing short of Amazing! I love this place!!",

    "text": "Amazing Thai food!  My friend is always talking about her past trip to Thailand and there's one specific dish she misses most and it's Khao Soy - also known as the nation's dish! I was born in Thailand but never heard of that before so I decided to try it.   The ambience is awesome. Clean facility, smiling host and friendly tentative wait staff. Customer service is good.   There were so many appetizers that I wanted to try. I love traditional Thai home cooked meals (I know, I know - my opinion is biased) and this place serves them all! Since I can't eat it all, we stuck with 1 app to share and an entree each. Warning - they serve a hot and sour soup before your meal arrives and it's delicious but very filling so go light on the free soup if you have a small appetite.   Papaya salad - I'm a papaya salad connoisseur. Seriously. Actually, I love any veggie salad made in the traditional Thai way - pounded in a mortar and pestle and extra spicy! This place hit the spot. I asked for the salad to be Lao style cause I love the umami of the sauce and they served it just right. It was super spicy, loads of flavor and most importantly, they added salted baby crabs and plenty of lime wedges. It was so good!   My friend ordered the national dish and I tried hers since I didn't want to commit - it's not for me. She LOVED it! Basically ate the entire bowl. To me, it was amped up curry soup with egg noodles. Too rich and thick for my liking but that doesn't mean the dish wasn't good - I just found that I don't care for khao soy.   My entree was lard na which is stir fried noodles and veggies in a thick gravy - and that was PERFECT! It was so good. There's a slightly sweet soy sauce flavor that coated every meat, veggie and noodle strand. I slurped it all up!   We ended our meal with Thai teas to go - another warning, it'll turn your tongue a weird orange color. But we'll worth it!   The hubs is jealous that I went without him. That just means I have to go back with him. No complaints about that! I'm definitely gonna try their other apps.",

    "text": "I've been here before but this time was a memorable experience. We came into an almost empty restaurant. It's Saturday and right before the rush so it was perfect. Right after we were seated the flood gates opened, lol.   We ordered the wings as an appetizer, pad Thai and drunken noodles. The wings came right out. We then noticed our meal was taking a long time. During that time everyone around us got their food, even a group that walked in well after we had our wings. One couple even noticed and said \"it'll be next.\" I laughed and said \"y'all will get yours before ours\". Sure enough theirs came out next. At this point we are furious but remained calm. My husband spoke with the waiter and he said it was coming right out. Won't waste anymore of your time but after 45minutes we finally got our food.   The waiter was very apologetic, almost uncomfortable but he felt really bad. We asked to speak with a manager, there wasn't one available and not even one on duty, hmmmm. They ended up \"speaking with the manager\" and were able to give us 50% off.   All in all, our food was delicious and the waiter was decent so that's why I gave more than 1 star. Maybe we will try again, maybe we won't.",

I was so stuffed by the time my Pad Thai came out, that I barely finished it. I had to pack it to go. Thai Iced Tea was one of my faves thus far, and I will always forgo alcoholic drinks at Rai Lay if this is available.  I can't wait to be back!",

But I really did enjoy this place at one point and hope that they improve based on my experience that I encountered recently. I came in to eat on Friday the 13th (coincidence much ?) well my experience wasn't pleasant. Don't get me wrong the food was good. This isn't my first time at Rai Lay, as I do enjoy their spicy basil chicken and always find myself coming in when I'm craving Thai food. But this review is mainly for the staff. The host and waitstaff is friendly and sweet but my problem is with the sushi guy, bartender, management/ownership. I saw with my own eyes the sushi guy drinking alcohol on the job and seeing that just killed my whole experience. I know other people saw it as well and the workers were acting as if it was normal and as if they do this often. I mean is it normal to be drinking while working in the food industry ? If so then maybe it's just me who doesn't want to see it. I don't know if the whole staff is drinking on the job but seeing that really had me worried. I personally don't want to be served food by employees who are drunk or have been drinking on the job. The bartender is suppose to be in control of the alcohol so shame on her for giving her coworkers alcohol to drink. Also shame on the management and owners for not keeping an eye on their employees and allowing them to do this. I honestly used to love this place but after seeing that, it's changed my perspective completely. I do know that no restaurant is perfect as well and hopefully I'll find myself coming back once the problem is fixed. I don't want to give up on them just yet which is a good thing.",

It wasn't too sweet or too spicy. My dinner entree was the chicken/tofu kao soy which had depths of flavor! If you're looking for some good Thai food around the area then definitely give this place a try! Great service, reasonable prices with considerable portions!",

A host for lunch and dinner should be present, instead of the manager and servers finding the time to seat them.

I had thaitini ( hard thai tea) and tasted yummy. We got Basil thai chicken to share and it was just the right hot to hit the spot. Sushi was amazing, we had a shrimp tempura roll.

I guess the night I came which is last Wednesday, they finalized their menu from the time they opened.  Greet by the hostess. Our server Noy was tentative, sweet and informative! My friend and I were excited to try a new Thai restaurant since our go to is Thai Taste!  Our dishes for the night: Shaking Beef(Vietnamese dish) very sweet saucy and meaty. Bestie likes it a lot. Chicken fried rice was really good. Tastes very fresh and light yet comforting! Then fried ground catfish with papaya salad. The salad was yummy but I'm very confused with the fried catfish. Very bland and dry.. Even mixing with the salad didn't help. I'll leave that alone even for next time for sure! Then the Panther Sushi. Nothing special about it at all.. I'm not impressed! Very pricey for what it is!  Now desert.. The lava chocolate cake. It's sooo good.. Tasted like the same cake from Lebowski's! We're sooo stuffed but we have to finish the cake!   Overall I think the items a little over priced. Especially the sushi when compared to soo many good sushi places around them. I'll save my money to go to Nikko's instead! But the other food are good. I wouldn't mind coming back for the fried rice, shaking beef and try other things on the menu!",

The thai wings and the spring rolls were ok. The thai wings tasted more like regular spicy honey bbq wings. The Paleo dish was very good. It was pork belly braised in a sweet soy sauce braising liquid along with a hard boiled egg. The sauce was great over some rice. We also ordered the shrimp drunken noodles. It was definitely way too salty and hard to swallow after a few bites. Portions were decent. Apps are expensive but entrees are average price. All bottles of wine were $20 saturday which was not too bad. This place was ok there are better thai reataurants in the area. Just need to tweak their sauces a bit.",

I got takeout the other night and there was some good and some not so good, which is why I'm giving them a 3 star rating.  Shaking beef-awesome. Just yummy. Good portion size.   Larb -tofu (like lettuce wraps) very odd flavor that wasn't enjoyed by my husband or I. And holy onions! Even if you love onions which my husband does, the whole darn dish was onions. Complete overkill.   Curry- they don't have specific dishes on the menu it's just curry of the day. When I called in the order I was told it came with mixed vegetables. Ok there was probably 2 red peppers sliced up and sauteed in there. I like peppers. But I'm used to and wanted something besides that in my curry dish. Where's the eggplant? The green beans? The potatoes? Skimpy on the chicken as well.  All in all it was a cute place. I'd maybe go back for the shaking beef. The staff at the register is very young and be cautious when they hand you your takeout bag because I got the wrong one and and am glad I caught it prior to leaving.",

The server talked a little too much, but she was friendly and excited about telling us what's good on the menu. We ordered an app of Moo Ping. Holy shit!!  Marinated pieces of tender pork shoulder on skewer and it comes with sticky rice and a dipping sauce that's sweet , salty, and savory. The sticky rice comes in a cool little  woven basket type thing and you break open the cellophane to get it out. You roll some rice into a ball, grab a piece of pork and dip into the sauce. That shit knocked me out!! Should've ordered ten of em!  I ordered Kao Soy because of what I heard. However, I'm not a curry lover and should've ordered something else. But, it was beautifully presented, came with a hot chili oil you can pour over and lime. I ordered mine with shrimp. It had such depth of flavor, but can only be enjoyed if you like curry. My friend had the chicken lo mein and that was delicious. Noodles perfectly cooked, great flavor, so good. Order the sticky rice dessert with mango and vanilla ice cream. Very interesting and delicious. They have places in 2 other locations. I'm definitely going back for the pork skewers. Yummo!!",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I have only had the crab fried rice (no onions) from here- but OMG it is one of my favorite dishes in all of charlotte. I have been probably 12-15 times now and the rest of the menu looks amazing- but I cannot bring myself to try anything else.   They do not skimp on the crab and it is full of flavor!The first time I got it 4 (out of 5) spicy and it was a little too much for me.  I am a big fan of spicy too.  I would say go at least 1 star less than you think just to be on the safe side.  Also, be prepared to eat it for days b/c they give you about 5 lbs in your order (my go to carryout for when the wife is out of town and I just eat it all weekend).   They do not skimp on the crab and it is full of flavor!",

The room is bright and modern. We went for lunch and it got pretty busy. The service was good and everyone was friendly.   The food selections were good, there were some different dishes that I haven't seen in many places around Charlotte so that was exciting. Their curry dish was also better than average. Value wise I found it a little overpriced, especially their sushi... but I guess that's the upcharge for being in Southend. They do have specials daily to be sure to check those out.",

Waitress was awesome and they had a number of local brews on tap that I appreciated.   The food was great. I order chicken larb at every Thai restaurant I go to. This was the best I've ever had. Great fresh taste with the lime juice and fresh cilantro, some slices of fresh and tasty yellow tomato and cucumbers. A little salty but I ate the entire appetizer myself. We also ordered the spring rolls that I'm told were good but I was busy double fisting larb lettuce wraps and couldn't be bothered with them.   A previous review mentioned they had pad see yew even though it wasn't listed on the menu. We ordered that to split and it was equally delicious. Had a spicy/sweet combo that was nice, and veggies were still a little crisp and quite fresh. Entire meal was $40 with two beers. Great date night!  New favorite Thai restaurant in town. Highly recommend!",

I ordered the pad Thai for a comfort food treat, and if I didn't place the order I probably wouldn't have recognized that's what it was. Maybe it was my mistake to add veggies instead of tofu, but there was definitely an absence of sprouts, peanuts, and the green onions looked extremely dark and wilted.",

They also have very cool and unique light fixtures, loved the ambiance. The service was also very attentive. I have now tried the Kao Soy, Palo, Moo Ping, Shaking Beef, and the Whole Snapper. They are all very delicious. This place is different than your normal Thai place but that's why I love it.  Venture outside of your box and try something you haven't had or may have never even heard of before. One of my good friends taught English in Thailand and Kao Soy was his favorite dish there. I was very excited to try it when I heard this place had it, it did not disappoint, and now one of my favorite Thai dishes that I have ever had.   I am looking forward to going back and trying more options on their menu.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for this place to open! FINALLY! We walked in today for lunch to find a packed Rai Lay. It's much smaller than I expected, a little cramped as far as seating goes. It's a very trendy/modern place, the EDM never stopped and the decor was not average of a Thai place. Our server was quick to pour us water and take out order. The salted edamame was nice to munch on while we waited. I ordered the Kao Soy because who doesn't love curry noodles and the bf ordered the basil chicken spice level 3. It can get a little pricey for lunch, my noodle dish was $14 but fairly large for a lunch portion.   We found the basil chicken had good flavor but it was extremely spicy for a level 3! I feel like Rai Lay's level 3 is a 4-5 in reality. Order a Thai iced tea if you order anything over a spice level 2. This is the first time I've seen ground chicken in this dish also. The Kao Soy was da bomb! I loved the curry gravy here, the coconut based curry was both sweet and spicy. The fried noodles on top gave nice crunch and the overall presentation was beautiful. I would definitely get the Kao Soy again. At our neighboring table, a fellow dinee got the oyster pancakes, that will be my next victim.. It smelled heavenly.   I couldn't finish the Kao Soy so I had to take it home. A suggestion for soupy dishes, please consider closed plastic containers in stead of the styrofoam box... I had to drive home slow to make sure the car wasn't detailed with my leftovers.",

    "text": "Thai food is certainly one of my guilty pleasures.  I really only trust the Thai restaurants where the decorations look like they were shipped straight from Thailand and the owner's mom is in the back making spring rolls.  It's not typically someplace I would go on a Friday with friends before heading out for a night on the town, but you can always trust it for a casual dine-in or take-out dinner any day of the week.  Rai Lay completely takes that concept and tosses it out the window.  I walked in on a Sunday night with a friend thinking \"ok, let's try something new.  If it's bad, we'll go for pizza after.\"  Well, no need for pizza.  We walked in and the place had a cool vibe/atmosphere to it.  Definitely a place I would go with friends before going out or on a date.  The place is small and doesn't have a ton of tables, so I can only imagine the wait when this place starts getting busy.  The drinks were hit and miss...I think they are still working on some recipes.  The Sweet Tea Mojito was a big fail, while the Sakerita was a huge hit.  Tasted awesome and you can get it with either a sugar or salt rim dusted with sriracha.  Also, good to know that they have $3 Mimosas on Sunday...I would expect nothing less than a mimosa special on a weekend.  Saving the best for last...the food.  First, they came around with a little sushi sample.  I didn't try it because I don't like fish, but it looked beautify.  We ordered the Fried Spring Rolls, which were good and not greasy at all.  We also destroyed the Basil Chicken and Pad Thai.  Both were excellent and the restaurant accommodated our request for ingredient substitutions.  Warning though on the basil chicken...it's ground chicken and not chunks.  If you haven't tried it with ground chicken, it was great and flavorful.  So yeah, I'll be back.  I went there less than 24 hours ago and have already recommended it to two people.  Staff is very friendly and wants your feedback, so if you love/hate something, let them know!",

The portion sizes were big and we even had leftovers to take home. Thai ice tea was authentic and you could tell it was made in house.

The spring rolls tasted like it was just shredded cabbage wrapped in a spring roll wrap, served with jarred duck sauce (no way it resembled thai sweet chili sauce). Husband had the spicy basil, and I had panang curry.  Both seemed kind of 2-dimensional, like they were missing something.  Will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Excellent Thai spot close to downtown Charlotte. Stopped in for a quick dinner before heading back to school after Fall Break. We usually go to Thai Taste but had to branch out since it's closed on Sundays. Rai Lay had good reviews according to the Charlotte Agenda, so we gave it a try. Boy are we glad we did! The Pad Thai was out of this world! I had the tofu and it was very good. Better than Thai Taste, I dare say! 10/10 - will definitely be returning. Be sure to check out Rai Lay when you're in the mood for some delicious Thai.",

She convinced my toddler to try new foods, and was super attentive and engaging. We can't wait to come back and try new things, and we will definitely request to be at Howie's table! Five star food, five star service!",

    "text": "I love thai food!! I stumbled across this place. I came in to order some food to go for lunch. I got the drunken noodles aka pad kee mao. I got the lunch portion with chicken. It was labeled a spice level 3. I told the girl I love spicy food and asked if I should get it into a 4 or 5 and she told me no since it was so spicy. It was not spicy enough for me. The noodles were cooked ok but they were all sticking together. I'm taking about 3 big clumps of noodles. It was really hard to separate and since they were all sticking together, there wasn't enough sauce. Most of the onions in the dish were good but they forgot to cut the outer layer of the onion so it was super chewy. Overall, the place was good. I'm gonna try their sushi next time.",
