Mind you this was morning before work. They brought me napkins and soda water. No discount or offer to get my check. And when I asked for more coffee, it was discovered that I was given decaf which is not what I ordered.",

I decided to make it simple and order 3 poached eggs cooked medium, a side of bacon and a side of fruit. I also ordered a cup of coffee. We waited quite a while for our food to arrive. I was okay drinking my coffee but, after drinking about half of my coffee I noticed there was some disgusting brown gunk stuck on the inside of my glass. I don't get-easily grossed out but this almost made me gag.  Then, when receiving my order, my eggs were awful! I had to send them back and then wait longer for my second batch. THESE eggs  pictured here are the SECOND batch I received. These are the worst poached medium eggs I've ever received at a restaurant! Keep in mind I paid $12 for this breakfast, not including my coffee. Other than the kind waiter I was very disappointed. It would have been nice for them to at least not charge me for the meal.",

Chris stayed on top of the cleanliness of our table.  While packing up my nephew spilled his chocolate milk from his to-go cup.

I went there solo so I just needed a seat somewhere to eat. At the front door the hostess guided me down stairs to avoid a long wait to see if they could slip me in somewhere. The downstairs hostess was welcoming and pointed me towards the lady doing the seating. They both suggested hanging loose until a bar seat came open or wait 40 minutes. I slid into a bar seat in 5 minutes and enjoyed my meal.",

    "text": "Our canvassing of Wells Fargo and Bank of America was a tremendous success. Serveral people signed up to volunteer.  I also had the pleasure of having brunch at Famour Toastery. The coffee is divine. \"Lavazza coffee is actually from Hawaii not Itally,\" my co-protestor replied to my very off the cuff remark of how I loved Itallian coffee.   The emblem, \"Lavazza,\" was artfully displayed on the cappuccino cup. I love good coffee and the staff was more than willing to provide top offs and to go cups on the house.  We were canvassing at the Pride Parade for ActionNC, soliciting signatures from venders and participants alike. Wells Fargo did a terrific job of selecting socially conscience venders. AIDS research, LBGTQ advocacy, the ACLU, and the Peace Corp were all represented among others..   Given the broad array of positive social actors providing great information, I was dissapointed to be one of the groups who were protesting Wells Fargo and their sister institution BofA.    The Wells Fargo Foundation is over 30 million invested Geo Group and Core Civic, two of the industry leaders in private prison management, and detention centers.  Some of those facilities have recently been featured in the news due to the Zero Tolerance policies of the current administration. Private prisons are  businesses that profit from human suffering and racial imbalance. They provide incentives to unfairly incarcerate members of certain communities. They leave a wake of destruction in the form of emasculated ommunites and separated families.   The food at Famous Toastery was above par. Breakfast anytime is a hard sell for me but everyone was pleasantly surprised. The manager, a bald gent, made sure our orders were accurate. He was relentless as a server. Relentless in the good way that only a manager who takes pride in their work can be. At first I thought he was the owner but then I realized that every employee seemed equally invested. Leading from the front; a terrific leadership strategy. That is a tried True trickle down theory.  I wish Wells Fargo would continue to lead from the front with regards to private prisons and ICE related detention centers. Wells Fargo is a proud institution in the City of Charlotte but the sort of corporate double speak that they are currently engaged in is reprehensible. To support such diverse groups and yet invest in detention centers, and the private prison industry is hypocritical. It makes zero sense Wells Fargo and others have essentially sold their corporate souls for 30 pieces of silver.  Great Coffee.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprisondivest.com%2F2018%2F07%2F16%2Ffamiliesbelongtogether-demands-wells-fargo-and-jpmorgan-chase-stop-financing-for-profit-prison-companies-benefiting-from-family-separation%2F&s=20666178917a6353bc92024c66bc646aa21e9c019d652af9832d88fcd3d1305c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">prisondivest.com/2018/07...</a>",

I know you're probably thinking it's just a waffle....but trust me. Just try it! The grits are amazing (even plain...no cheese or sugar needed). The country benedict is amazing...the gravy is very good southern gravy! (With sausage). I normally order the potatoes extra crispy. Coffee is also great- stronger than most.   The uptown location is a little odd/hard to find and there is no outdoor seating. Great portion sizes...you will leave FULL :)",

It was $10 which is about on par for Uptown eating but the Burrito was big. Also you can get a flour or spinach wrap like I did. Definitely would recommend.",

    "text": "My folks saw this place advertised on the news as a must-do for brunch or breakfast. They brought me here during a recent visit over Labor Day weekend.   It is located in the same parking lot as JT Posh, with a few designated spots in front of the restaurant. We arrived about an hour after opening, which someone from the wait staff said was ideal if you're trying to beat the crush of people coming in.   They let us choose our seats and grabbed drinks quickly while we looked over the menu. In addition to the regular menu, they offer daily specials. I went back and forth on a special versus a breakfast sandwich, but decided on the breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, and cheese on sourdough bread. I also added a side of their potatoes.  It's a restaurant where everyone is your waiter - if you need something, you can flag down any of the wait staff for assistance. We rarely needed to get anyone's attention as those who passed our table were very attentive and quick to ask about refills or checking on how we were doing. I was amazed that one of the guys offered to grab more water for my tea free of charge - most of the places I order hot tea from it's limited to a single cup or a small teapot if you're in a nicer place.   Breakfast sandwich was excellent - bread was toasted, cheese perfectly melted, and the egg ratio on the sandwich was perfect. (Sometimes the restaurants overcompensate on eggs and the other ingredients are lost.) The potatoes were cooked well and had a bit of spice on them - my mom complained they were too spicy but I felt it was just right.  One drawback to the restaurant is table size - if you have 3-4 people at one square table and you're ordering large meals, you might struggle to have enough room for everything on the table. We sort of had to play jigsaw puzzle with placing glasses and plates carefully on the table without knocking things over.  I'd come back here again for the food and fantastic service.",

    "text": "A super reliable breakfast place.  I was in town for HeroesCon like I typically am most years and there's always the dilemma of where to eat breakfast. Do you eat some place downtown that's in walking distance or drive to someplace close by since Charlotte has a ton of amazing restaurants all over the city. The Famous Toastery has a new location in uptown that is very close to the convention center. Barley a 5 minute walk (and walking in uptown Charlotte is a delight).  They are located right off Tryon st. It's a little hidden since you walk into an office building and take an elevator down a floor. Once there it's very easy to find and they have lots of seating. The Famous Toastery is very much a traditional breakfast diner with more flare then an IHop or Waffle House. They have a very large and diverse menu. As someone that loves breakfast food I love poring over their extensive menu and wondering what to get.   I settled on their Famous Hash (corned beef ad shredded potatoes topped with eggs any style and hollandaise sauce). It's all the things I love in a breakfast item. It also comes with your choice of bread side (toast, muffin, etc...) It was terrific. All the breakfast elements I love in once place. I couldn't ask for more.   I was incredibly satisfied with my experience here. My only criticism is they didn't have any iced coffee which in 2018 seems like a weird choice. Its a little thing, but I do love my Iced Coffee.   If you're looking for a very dependable breakfast place that's quick and has lots of options this is your place.",

We did enter through the basement of sorts in the office building and were asked if we wanted downstairs or upstairs. So we walked through the downstairs which felt, literally, like a cafeteria, and when we went upstairs were pleasantly surprised with what felt like, well, a wonderful cafe with great windows and light.  I wouldn't eat in the lower floor, so we'll probably still find our way to Dilworth unless we knowingly are awake before the breakfast crowd rush (9:30 a.m.) to guarantee a seat upstairs  Service was AWESOME. we had such a sweet, bubbly blonde whom I wish I remembered her name because we was fabulous.

We looked shocked..the girl at counter said, \"they are eating here!\" After a few minutes, our plates arrived. They had dumped the food on cold plates, didn't reheat anything. Our eggs were ice cold. They finally remembered the salsa...to dump on ice cold eggs. Our pancakes were ice cold. No butter on them or offered, it wouldn't melt anyway. Then it took a few minutes and they brought some cold syrup to put on it. Awful! No excuse, but pitiful management. Another couple beside us got a visit from either chef or management to apologize about forgetting order and comped them. They said they had waited 40 minutes. We heard lots of cutting up behind the scenes, seems delivering a prompt hot breakfast is not important. Very unimpressed.",

    "text": "In town for a conference so decided to stop by this spot I found on Yelp for a sit down breakfast. Located in an office building downstairs so no off-street presence. Plenty of space and seating available. Very clean decor and atmosphere. I ordered the breakfast burrito on spinach tortilla. From order to the table was pretty quick. For $8 I was surprised at the small portion with nothing additional. Food tasted well but nothing breath taking. Pros are: very friendly staff, fast service and food was descent. Don't really have a con, was just underwhelmed with portion. It was really just a small sandwich and not a burrito as I was expecting. So for me it was average, nothing more and nothing less.",

Before I do my review of the food I did want to mention that since this restaurant is in the heart of downtown so the only issue you may have is finding parking. We walked so we had no issues with parking. Also, the restaurant is below.  Now let's talk about the food. It was delicious! I had the breakfast combo and that came with bacon, two eggs and a waffle(which comes with delicious whip cream and berries. Again that was an excellent choice! A friend of mine had the avocado Benedict and said it was delicious as well! Let's not talk about the drinks! They were on point! I definitely recommend you stopping by this restaurant if you are visiting or living in Charlotte area.",

Everything came out perfect and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their choices! I definitely recommend the potatoes, waffle, and my husband loved his corn beef hash. I liked that they give you the ability to choose the level of spice you want for your Bloody Mary. It was the perfect combo of mild with a little spice and it definitely delivered!

There is a lot of egg options, breakfast burritos, pancakes and French toast to name a few. I ordered French toast with bacon and red potatoes on the side.  My son ordered eggs Benedict with bacon and potatoes. The potatoes were really good.  They could have used a little more salt but I added it at the table. My French toast was okay but needed some vanilla. The bacon was cooked and tasted good. My son said his eggs were cooked perfect and enjoyed his potatoes and bacon. The price was reasonable for what we ordered. The ambiance was quiet and clean for a Sunday morning. Coffee was also good. Nothing knocked my socks off making me want to return. In my opinion it was just okay.  A decent filling breakfast at a decent price. It came to around $30 including tip for breakfast for two.",

I got a hot chocolate, which is the only thing I regret ordering.  I ordered two main plates--a BYO omelette and a Benedict.  Both were delish.    My counterparts had the flavored waffles.  Apparently the blueberry was fabulous.  The apple, not so much.    The prices weren't too steep and it was nice to be able to flag down any server.  We weren't sure if we had to take the check up ourselves or if someone would take care of it for us.  We asked, and a server answered that she could take care of it--but in a way that we couldn't tell if she was doing us a favor or if this was the standard.  So we still don't know what we are _supposed_ to be doing...  Oh well.  We'll be back.",

The waiters are super friendly, but say that their policy is that everyone is your waiter. Sounds great, but there were times were waiting for just anyone to come and take our order. A solid 10 mins went by before someone took at least a drink order.  Otherwise the food was delicious. I had the breakfast burrito and requested turkey sausage to be put in for extra flavor. I highly suggest this for those who have big appetites! My friend ordered the french toast and was easily impressed by its flavor and simplicity.  Avoid the hot chocolate because they just use the grocery store packets. Womp womp. Otherwise it seemed like the bloody marys and mimosas were popular so I would give that a try!",

Everything from the biscuit, eggs, and fruit were fresh.  Staff was very courteous, friendly, and attentive.  It was reasonably priced.",

    "text": "That was disappointing.  I had really high hopes for the biscuit sandwich.  But it lacked any flakiness and was almost soggy.  The staff are super pleasant and responsive. But between my sandwich and my guest's chorizo scramble, I don't expect much from the rest of the menu choices.",

The atmosphere was really relaxing and nothing could have made it a better experience!  Great kids menu with chocolate chip pancakes and fruit!  Wonderful banana and walnut crepes! Thanks for making our visit to Charlotte a little like home.",

All servers wait on all diners, so you may be assisted by several people. You can enter from 330 S. Tryon St. or from the side street. Go early on the weekend--before people wake up and get there before you do.",

    "text": "On 9/15 my partner was served a blueberry stuffed french toast dish and found the bread to be molded. Reported it to the servers, I saw them show it to the manager Erin Green and her immediate response to the server was that it was just blueberry sauce and denied that it was mold. She barely looked at the dish. The blueberry filling was VERY clearly a vibrant purple color and was mainly towards the middle of the bread. The suspected mold was on the back edge of the bread, no filling was on the back corners, and it was an obvious greyish-green color and had a dusty/fuzzy texture, as most molds on bread do. We went ahead and paid the bill and left and declined their offer for another french toast, as my partner was no longer hungry but we still firmly believe that that was mold on the bread and not blueberry filling. It was blatantly obvious what it was yet it was denied. We were very polite about the situation but after reflecting i wish i would have said more and i feel as though we should have had atleast some compensation for the contaminated meal. Although their is not much to be done about it now, i thought that corporate should be aware of this location and the quality of food that they are serving consumers. The servers were all quite pleasant and polite but i felt as though the manager Erin Green who was on duty should have been more attentive to the situation and actually tried to look at the dish rather than immediately dismiss the issue and deny. She didnt even come speak to us. Someone needs to check the health standards of the kitchen. I understand things happen and bread molds but for it to be served to a customer is unacceptable. Someone in the kitchen was not being attentive to what they are plating and serving. I dont appreciate someone i love being served contaminated food.",
