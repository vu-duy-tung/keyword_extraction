The lettuce was very brown and black and the croutons were very stale . Everything seem very old even thr bread which was ice cold each time. My meal arrived with many things missing off my baked potatoes. I was looking forward to having a great meal but I didn't get this tonight . And the manager suppose to have came to our table but never came I only gave this visit two stars because the waiter was nice . Don't come to this location of you are hungry and want a good meal",

We arsed a bloomin onion which wasn't great and asked for ketchup and bread at that time. At other locations we've been to,  you don't have to ask for the bread.  A longggggg time later she brought the bread,  no ketchup. I ordered tenderloin medallions without the vegetables ( med to med-well). I normally order well-done,  but thought I'd try something different.  It came out barely warm and almost bloody,  with peppers (which I can't stand) and onions. We were there entirely too long and weren't offered any compensation for the terrible meat.",

It came back like a hockey puck on a plate.  We informed the waitress. She said she'd fire one up right away.  Well 30 minutes later i still had not gotten my food.  By the time I received it, everyone else had finished eating. The least the manager ciuld have done was offer to comp my food. Nothing.  We showed the waitress a 15% coupon from RetailMeNot and the manager came over to tell us they did not accept those.   Needless to say, lunch was horrible.",

The prime rib was cooked fine, but it was a little more tough than I would have liked it to be, especially the outside with the seasoning.  There was not much flavor to the prime rib.   The lobster tail was great and my salad and dessert were very delicious.  I highly recommend upgrading the salad to the wedge salad.  It was fantastic.  I don't like bleu cheese so they did it with ranch.  My server was superb.  She checked on me multiple times and gave me great suggestions.   I will likely go back.",

About a year ago Outback rebranded their stores to a more upscale decor. They changed their menu and downsized their portions.  This store was clean, server was polite and food was mediocre. The wings were small over cooked and greasy the steak did not have much flavor the outside was char'd and cold on the inside. The prices have gone through the roof considering the downsized portion size. Overall, it was just OK, next time I have a urging for a real good steak...I'll look elsewhere.",

They are always warm when they come out and sooo good! You literally can't just eat one!   For starters we tried the blooming onion much better than I remembered. It was not greasy and heavy, I really enjoyed it! Each piece was crispy and I loved the sauce that they bring with it! It was spicy and so full of flavor...a great match for the onion pieces!  To drink I chose the Georgia peach- \"down under\"  which means they add an extra shot of liquor! Going forward all my drinks here will be going \" down under\" this was a mix of peach flavored slushy mix and liquor! Delicious!   For dinner I ordered the Outback special 6oz with a loaded baked potato and broccoli as the side. The steak was just ok, a little overlooked for my taste. The potato was delicious and I agree with some previous reviews the veggies were a little buttery.  Still it was a great meal, and I'm sure to return!",

    "text": "I met two friends here for dinner on a Friday night, which based on the parking lot, I thought we'd have a problem getting seated. I did get a \"buzzer\" & was told it would be 15-20 minutes; however, we snagged some seats at the bar & ended up grabbing a table in the bar area.   We got helped almost immediately after being seated & ordered the coconut shrimp. That, along with the bread came out in less than 10 minutes. However, the time it took for our salads & entrees was quite a different story. I believe we waited 15 minutes for our salads & about 10-15 more for our entrees of two steaks & one chicken entree. Not once did our waitress apologize for the delay.  The coconut shrimp were delicious. They were huge pieces of shrimp, with plenty of the coconut breading. The salads were fresh. Our meals were cooked to our liking; however, the chicken was very dry. They did take it back & bring my friend another piece of chicken & fresh serving of the vegetables. She was pleased with the second attempt.   This visit wasn't great enough to make me want to come back to this location. I think I'll stick with the Huntersville one.",

And don't try the delivery service...HORRIBLE. After waiting 45 mins she's a no show so I called and asked about my delivery...shes concerned about the driver because she left the store 20 mins ago coming to my house so she put me on hold to check her safely!!! She comes back \"I'm so glad she's okay I was worried about the driver but she said she's 4 mins away\"... ok glad she's okay but why so late with my food??? over an hour delivery and she delivered my drink with the straw already in the cup.... don't trust that at all! I'll stick with dining in no more curbside or delivery!",

I'm a sucker for their brown bread and it was never hot and fresh , even when me and my guest requested some . I'm guessing they were trying to get rid of the  older bread as it was getting closer to closing .  Salad was brown and croutons were stale .  The steak was actually ok ,, although bland   But was  cooked well and  mashed potatoes were ok . Just throwing this out there , I didn't like the fact that a baked potato could be \"loaded\" for free but mashed potatoes would be charged 1$ . Why  ?  All in all probably won't break my next to eat here again .. But I may give them a try again  .",

    "text": "We decided to have dinner here for my boyfriend's birthday. First, the waitress did provide great service; we have no complaints about Emma. However, we both ordered the steak and endless shrimp (#teamgreedy). We both had our steaks prepared medium and the first time they came out, they were cooked to perfection. We sent hem back because they were too salty. The manager was supposed to come out and speak to us. That was about 45 minutes ago: still nothing. The second set of steaks that came out were not as salty, but mine was over cooked. It was a step or ten beyond well done. I sent it back and did not want a replacement meal. STILL no manager has come to speak with us and the bill was incorrect. She has managed to go and speak with the table next to us whose order was cold. They didn't complain until after I complained about my second steak was sent back. The bill was incorrect and sent back. After the correction it is still wrong. It has been about 30 more minutes, still no manager. Maybe there's a breakdown in communication, maybe the manager didn't care to come talk to us...whatever the reason we won't be back to find out. Again, EMMA did a great job even though she is new. She kept her cool and got everything taken care of. Knowing that she is new, makes it even worse that Sydney (the manager) did not come over to handle the complaint about the food.",

    "text": "We came here for two reasons...  1. We got some gift cards for Christmas 2. It was my fiance's birthday Last time we came to an Outback we shared the 28 oz (I think) steak and added an extra side, but this time we decided to just get whatever we wanted (and more)! For starters, we had the sampler plate. It came with the blooming onion, french fries with cheese and bacon, and fried mac and cheese. The blooming onion (it was just pieces) were slightly over cooked, but the sauce is AMAZING! The fries, were pretty good but it seemed like it sat in the window for a little because the cheese just came off in one huge lumb... so we basically just had plain fries. The fried mac and cheese, were alright. Everything was fried on this sampler, so when we got to them we were just a little over the fried foods. It was nice and hot on the outside, but not scolding on the inside.  For my entree I got the steak and lobster tail. I think I got an 8 oz steak and my side was a stuffed baked potato. The steak was cooked perfectly - medium- and the baked potato!! I love their potato, and it was nice and hot.  The only downside to the meal was my fiance's steak was not cooked correctly. He asked for medium, and it came out really rare. They cooked it longer, and the manager herself came out to deliver the meal.  We also shared two of their shareable drinks. My favorite was the strawberry one! You can not taste the alcohol in it at all! The second one we drank was the blackberry one - he preferred this one.",

My friend got a completely different meal than what was ordered, and my husband didn't have his side brought out with the meal. When the server went to go get his mashed potatoes- he brought a scooped out baked potato. When we asked him about it, the server said the mashed potatoes were not cooked yet! There was no apology... they could have at least tried to rectify this with a dessert, heck I'll take an apology at this point. Never again, I won't waste my time or money here",

    "text": "The review reads 3 stars but as I write I am considering two stars and a half stars. Please let me say this rating is not because of the food.   I arrived at Outback to join my friends for a birthday celebration. Days prior to arrival we were told that we could not make a reservation that we simply have to arrive together and hope to be seated as close as possible to one another. This made us nervous however we followed the directive for the manager and it did work out for us.  We arrived at 7pm and the restaurant was not full yet the parking lot was full. This make me question if the parking lot is large enough. I have had a parking issue at this location before. I will say that the outside of the restaurant is inviting with it's multiple outdoor seating options for dining and/or lounging. The greeters and hostesses are friendly and the waiting area was nice, clean and designed well.  Once we all arrived we were seated quickly. They even allowed us to decorate the table and the manager volunteered to hold the cake for us which gave us much needed table space.  Once we began to order or troubles began. Tyson introduced himself and informed us that Kassidy would also be serving us. Tyson took our drink orders and the appetizer order. For eases of ordering one person ordered all of the appetizers for the table. The drinks, which were all soft drinks and water, took a nearly 10 minutes to arrive. The appetizers took just about 30 minutes to reach the table. While waiting we were repeatedly offered the food which belonged to other tables. Even when we denied the the food the young man from the kitchen would return, with Kassidy, to insist that it was out food. The tables near us had to speak up and claim their food. After the appetizers arrived they took our orders. Tyson did a great job with the children in our group. However Kassidy was a bit edgy with everyone. A teenager in our group politely requested \" a larger cup of soda\" because he had been given a kid's cup. Kassidy's response, which he gave without actually stopping at the table was, \"we have larger cups!\" Plus we literally rolled his eyes. As he walked I glared at him so as he continued to walk he said \"but I guess I can bring a glass. We have those.\"  That soda did not arrive for nearly 15 minutes. Other drink refill request were also long waits, had to be requested multiple times or just never arrived. No one was ever offered a refill. Finally one person did not receive her entree. When she asked she was told it was coming. It never came. When she requested it in a to go box because we all finished it still never came. We had to ask again and then wait.   From my observation Kassidy was the issue. Tyson tried his best but everything Kassidy was involved in was a mess including the other tables he worked with.  So I won't discount Outback or Tyson. I will return and hopefully have a better review.",

Our wedge salad was very good, steak and shrimp was also up to par. The ambiance is very nice and restaurant seemed very clean. Will definitely be back, as it is so close to my home.

The crispy shrimp was nice, the other shrimp is drenched in a sauce that we didn't care for.",

Anthony was our waiter and he greeted us promptly and our drinks arrived within a timely manner. I ordered the 8oz prime rib with a side salad and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the Kookaburra wings and fries, and my son had chicken tenders and fries. All of our food was presented timely and was correct. My husband requested volcano sauce but after tasting that bleu cheese dressing, he didn't even use the sauce. He ranted and raved about how fresh the bleu cheese was even though he typically doesn't even eat it! My prime rib was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. It was tender and the mashed potatoes had great flavor. From beginning to end, our experience was a pleasure and we'll definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "I am all about service, and this past week a manager named Dom provided stellar service above and beyond! I have had an experience at this location previously that warranted a 1 star review, but because it was only due to the manager working that day and not the rest of the staff, I ignored the urge to post one. So this past Wednesday I came in and sat at the bar. Mark who was the bartender was extremely attentive and gave wonderful service as well as recommendations. I ordered some appetizers and continued my conversation with my party. Well I guess we were so into our talk that we didn't realize it had been quite some time since we had ordered. When I looked up to get Mark's attention, as if already knowing he stated that he had just checked on our food and it should be out shortly. So we asked if it could be packaged to go, and he stated that would not be a problem. As we finished our drinks, Dom a manager on duty came up with our order packed to go. She introduced herself, apologized for the long wait, explained what happened in the kitchen (system failure with ticket printing), apologized yet again and advised she had taken care of our food order for us. Now if this does not exemplify top notch service, I don't know what does!!! We did not have to ask for a manager, she presented herself... We did not have to remind the staff of the timely wait, Mark was already on it... And we did not have to ask for compensation for the error, Dom took care of it without the ask! This will be the reason I will continue to frequent this location from here on out. Thank you to these two wonderful people for their service: Mark and Dom , you are a dying breed in the service industry, continue to be the best at what you do!",

Although we scheduled a \"reservation\" we still waited an hour to be seated. The waitress we had was very nice and did the best she could under the circumstances. The service was slow. We were there for about 2 hours total. Everyone's food came out staggered which was weird and there were several steaks not prepared properly. The icing on the cake was that my food never came and apparently the order was overlooked. After bringing it to the attention of a manager and our waitress, they put the order in and when it came out it was hot, fresh and delicious. I have attached pictures of other plates but none of my own. I guess I was so hungry once it came out I got right to it and forgot the photo op. Oh well, next time. Hopefully service will be a bit faster and better coordinated. By the way, when the bill came, they had automatically comped my meal. That was awesome and made me feel they really did care and acknowledged the screw up.   This location is new, clean and the quality of the food was great. I will be back.",

Sat down at the table and my silverware had white stuff smeared all over it, I politely asked for another and the waitress notified my table by saying 'my apologies - we just ran them through the dishwasher quickly\". At that point, ew.  After, we get our food. My friends ordered a steak butterflied - it was not butterflied. My other friend ordered crusted Parmesan chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken came - no potatoes. The server says they'll take FIFTEEN minutes..when she brought the food.  A little later, manager Lindsay came over - we explained to her how the chicken came without a side and we were not notified... Lindsay could not fundamentally understand what was wrong with that and loudly said that is a standard practice to bring the food without any side because it typically takes 45 minutes to make mashed potatoes. Afterward, she says she's been at outback for 15 years. I truly hope she's not a representation of how management is at Outback. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to a good steak so we stopped here on a Friday night after shopping at Ikea. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated with no wait...it had been difficult to find an available parking space so we assumed it was packed. The restaurant was indeed fairly full so we must've just hit it right.  Our waitress was very attentive at first. She was quick to take our drink order and then for our food. She refilled drinks quite frequently but our actual meal seemed to take an extra long time. Thank goodness my husband had his cellphone games to keep him occupied.  We ordered the onion petals as an appetizer. Basically it was a bloomin' onion already disassembled...not what we were expecting based on onion petals we've had at other restaurants but they were fine. I had the French onion soup and it was very cheesy but not flavorful. The side salad with mustard vinegarette was the highlight of the meal. I'd never had that dressing before but it was excellent.   Next came our salt with a side of steak. Yes, you're reading that right. I have never, ever eaten a steak that was so overpowered and basically ruined by the seasoning. I didn't say anything while I was eating because I wondered if it was just me and finally my husband commented about the saltiness of his steak, too. I've eaten at Outback's before and never was this an issue.  When it came time to pay our waitress was busy with other tables, so I took the opportunity to pay using the Outback app. Much to my excitement it had a $5 coupon showing that I could use. I tried about 6 times (unsuccessfully) to apply it before just paying without it. That was a fitting end to this disappointment of a night.",

Visited this location for an early dinner with my parents due to being gifted a giftcard.  We arrived around 4:00 on a Sunday and was promptly seated. The restaurant was busy but not extremely so, nobody was waiting. We were greeted by our waitress and placed our drink orders as well an order of the famous 'blooming onion.'  My parents had a couple of questions regarding menu items and our waitress admitted to not knowing the answers. She also didn't attempt to find out.  Our blooming onion arrived hot and crispy. I was surprised the accompanying sauce was on the spicy side. It definitely has a kick! This was my first time having the blooming onion and I really liked it, I now understand why it's so popular.  For my entree, I ordered the small portion of the seared ahi tuna. Since it was so early, I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal. The tuna was another surprise - it was actually pretty good. The asian slaw that comes with it provided a nice, cool bite for the slightly, peppery tuna slices.  I really liked the fact that Outback provides a lot of other non-steak options. My mom ordered one of the chicken dishes and really enjoyed it, she raved of the juiciness of the chicken.   Will I be back? Not likely but I didn't leave Outback disappointed.",

I had the Parmesan crusted chicken, he had the chicken fingers with fries. Our little complimentary bread loaf was really stale. I guess it was sitting out for hours. The next one they gave us was warm and fresh. My chicken was good. Nothing to rave about. And why doesn't the meal come with two sides? I mean for almost $15, why not two sides instead of the meat and some vegetable medley? I had a salad instead of the vegetables (because I don't like yellow squash), which they brought out before the meal. When my food came it was a lone piece of chicken with some cheese on it on the plate. It looked pathetic. My husband liked his chicken fingers. Although he did peel a lot of the breading off of them.  Overall, it was meh at best. We would not return unless we had some sort of spectacular deal. The $6 off was not enough. I expected much better.",

    "text": "Absolute worst steak/meal EVER. Service staff and obviously kitchen staff need more training. We arrived at 3pm, restaurant was not busy, yet it still took about 15 minutes for our server to arrive. About 10 minutes after that our waters came out. We placed our order for an appetizer, blooming onion and then our meals, 2 sirloin steaks, MW. After another 15 min or so, the server came by and said he'd check on our appetizer.  Our appetizer never came out and our salads did but were delivered by someone other than our server. About 5 min later our onion arrived, burnt. Our server was not around. About 10 more minutes and out steaks arrived, again by someone else. My husbands was well and mine extremely over well and SO salty it was inedible. I had literally 3 small bites of my steak and it was just like leather. The server was nowhere in sight and I didn't want to make a scene by complaining to the server for the table beside ours, who incidentally also had overdone ribeye steak that they sent back to the kitchen. About 20-30 minutes passed as I just ate the burnt onion and the server finally came by to ask if we wanted boxes. Of course we didn't but I think it is so rude that he didn't acknowledge the near full order and ask if there was something wrong with it. We just wanted to leave and my husband asked for the check.  Terrible experience. Terrible service and absolutely inedible steaks. Would not have eaten the onion either but we were starving after a day of shopping and only a side salad. Never refilled our waters until picking up the check and never cleared our dirty plates. We left at 4:30. 1.5 hrs after arriving. Ridiculous.",

My potato and pork chop were on a plate that was too small to cut the pork chop, and it flew onto the floor. Then manager did a great job of replacing it.   But! My waiter had no idea, asked about desert shortly after getting out meals, then brought the check before I got my replacement pork chop and while we were still mid eating. Very upsetting and an industry no no.  I ended up asking for my porkchop to go because I didn't want to feel rush.   Another flaw: when I ordered my baked potato, he asked if I wanted everything on it. Being how I usually put the bitter and sour cream on the side, I said yes. What I got was a loaded baked potato. I feel duped. He could have asked if I wanted it loaded! :-(   I would give more stars for the manager, but because the waiter was slow on the uptake, only 1.   Then! My man was given the check and he put his card in it, but after the card was ran, the check was handed to me. Face palm.",

Terrible food, and con-artist, two-faced management told us they would comp our tab, only to scold our wonderful waitress and charge us full price! Unbelievable! I hope the \"proprietor\", whose name is proudly displayed over the entrance, will soon notice how wrong everything is on the inside. Beware - this place is not what you have come to expect from this chain. Pathetic. Like being scammed at a cheap carnival. Guess manager would rather get every cent from us once, and a bad review, than do right and have us return. How stupid... ( and this isn't even the half of it.)",

    "text": "Big Letdown from the Yelp Event I went to here.  Several weeks ago, I went to a Yelp Event here and was totally blown away with the new menu items and the phenomenal service. I gave the even an excellent rating because it was and well deserved and came back today to check out the restaurant under normal operations.  Sad to say, it did not meet expectation.  Service was slow, particular at the end when we were trying to check out. Service was also not accurate serving my wife a baked potato when she ordered potato soup and the quality of my Crispy Chicken Sandwich was just not there.  To expand, we drove down from Cornelius today for and early lunch. Got there about 11:30 and were promptly seated. No problems so far.  Our server presented herself and we ordered out beverages and my wife ordered a cocktail to go with her lunch.  When our drinks were served, we ordered out lunch.  I upgraded to a Premium Blue Cheese Wedge Salad and for my entree, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich.  My wife ordered the small Alice Springs Filet with Asparagus and Potato Soup.  Potato Soup came out as Baked Potato and had to be corrected.  My Wedge was good but quite frankly, I'm used to the Salad Course being served prior to the main course, not with.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was a bit too much crispy as the photo will show.  A bit of breading makes for a Crispy Chicken but when the depth of the Breading is twice the thickness of the Chicken, it's a bit much.  The Chicken Breast as such did not have a great resilient texture and left much to be desired.  Finally when it came time to settle the bill, I gave the server my Credit Card and she was gone for over 10 minutes. At this time, the restaurant, still had not gotten busy so no reason to explain the delay.  I had hopes for this place after the great initial experience but now I don't know.  Time will tell",

    "text": "I was really bummed I couldn't make the Yelp event here last week, so between seeing all the pictures and having friends that have told me how good this location is compared to the old one, I had to see it for myself!  I'm going to make a small assumption and say that most people who go out for dinner are expecting good food and service, but probably aren't thinking \"I hope this is the best service experience ever!\" Well I'm really trying to think of a time that my expectations were so blown away and I'm truly coming up short. I've eaten at a lot of Outback restaurants and there are definitely good ones and bad ones. This isn't just a good one, it's a jewel!  Dad's Birthday! Arrived at 6:30 on a very busy Sunday night. Judging by the parking lot, it's looking pretty slammed. This Outback, however, was well designed with the heavy traffic location in mind. To my surprise, they had a table for my party of five as soon as we arrived. Our waitress Megan got to our table with warm bread before we even got our coats off and our drink orders arrived in about a minute.  Let's start with appetizers, which were very noteworthy, even for such long-established Outback usuals: Bloomin' Onion and Coconut Shrimp. The Bloomin' Onion, I'm going to be honest, I was against getting this because it's been so greasy at every Outback I've ever ordered it at! But the table voted against me and I'm glad they did, it was perfect. Terrific breading that was crispy and well seasoned, minimal oil. I wasn't even aware it was supposed to be this way, I just assumed it should be greasy this whole time. Coconut shrimp was fried in the same fashion and I must say that I'll probably get this next time as well.  Food was coming out at a great pace, a couple of minutes after we finished apps, our entrees were making their way to the table. My ribeye was a near perfect medium rare. Girlfriend's parmesan chicken, delicious. My Dad couldn't quit praising the lobster tail served with his steak and he just got back from a vacation in Maine where great lobster is around every corner!  As good as the food was, our dinner experience was brought to the next level because of the unprecedented service. Our waitress Megan, I don't know where to begin. Not a single cup went dry, one of my big pet peeves when we go out for dinner! Every request was accommodated and all our questions were answered. She checked in our table so often you would have thought we were the only party in the restaurant! I can't say enough good things about Megan, she's a True professional. If anyone is looking for a fundamental definition of perfect service, just drop by this location and ask to sit in her section, I know I'll be doing so from now on!  I got a chance to meet the restaurant's Managing Partner Lindsey as well. I can tell that she takes a lot of pride in service excellence and her staff reflects this so well. This location is brand new so if you're wondering why the aggregate review score is so low, just know that Lindsey and her staff has turned things around with a new restaurant, new staff, and a new attitude. I'll be a regular here for sure.  At the end of the night, I was sitting at my table and trying to come up with some nit-pick negative to improve on, and came up empty. Highest acclaim to Megan, Lindsey, and all the staff at Outback who made my Dad's birthday such a memorable night!",

    "text": "I was excited for weeks about this visit Outback for a Yelp event.  I had dismissed the chain from my list of favored restaurants when they got rid of Toowoomba Pasta many years ago.  That left sweet potatoes as my only option on the menu.  Mind you, I never ordered steak when eating out as it was never cooked to my liking, until recently.  This location presented an opportunity to visit during soft openings.  Back to my long-awaited visit to Outback.  We were a party of 30+, a fete not easily managed.  We served a portion of menu items including:  Aussie Bloom:  Topped with fries and sirloin = 1/5 Aussie Cheese Fries (not for me):  3/5 Mixed veggies: zucchini, squash, and carrots = 5/5 Sirloin:  Sliced prior to serving (rare) = 2/5 Grilled Shrimp = 2/5 Lobster Tails:  perfectly cooked = 5/5 Salmon cakes served with mixed vegetables = 4/5 Lemonade:  1/5  Chocolate Cake:  Lush deliciousness! 5/5 Boomerang Beer Flight (paired with foods). I am not much of a beer drinker but I appreciate the effort = 3/5 Blackberry Sangria = 4/5  Given the above, I would opt for a lobster tail, sweet potato, and grilled veggies.  For dessert, I would definitely go with the chocolate cake.  As the menu is not a la carte, I don't plan to visit Outback anytime soon.  However, I may make an exception for a late night snack of chocolate cake with a nice glass of wine!",

Never been to a restaurant where they put the straws in the cups for you. Kind of weird. Asked for steak sauce and ketchup, was given to us in little dip containers but  the table next to us had bottles of both. My son was drawing on his child menu and the waitress sat the food down on it while he was drawing. Plate wasn't hot. It was almost like eating at a McDonald's that serves steak. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Before last night, I hadn't been to any Outback Steakhouse in over 20 years.. After my experience here, I'm left wondering how could I let that happen??  Had a late dinner here, around 9 pm. The restaurant was still pretty packed- always a good sign! LA & I opted for the special, dinner for 2 for $46. The special included a Bloomin' Onion, 2 salads, 2 entrees from a select menu, & a slice of cheesecake. If all of this was ordered a la carte, the total would've ran right around $55 so it's a good deal I suppose.   The Bloomin' Onion was pretty greasy & salty & the salads we ordered (House & Caesar) were nothing to write home about but the entrees are where Outback came through!  LA ordered the 9 oz Outback Center-Cut Sirloin & I ordered the 7 oz Salmon. The steak was cooked to medium-well & served with broccoli. The salmon was cooked to my liking (very well done) & served with mixed vegetables. My only gripe is I wish the vegetables were a little less done so they'd be more crunchy but the meat was on point. The salmon was nicely charred, seasoned well, & flaky & wasn't undercooked/mushy in the middle (I hate hate hate when it is).  Now the steak.. I very rarely eat meat, besides fish, but I'll take a bite here & there once in awhile. I tried a piece & omg it made me question what the hell I've been eating the last 10 years. Even during my carnivore years I was never one to order steak at a restaurant, it just never appealed to me. This steak was tender & again, seasoned well, no A1 necessary! (For the record.. I love A1).   The cheesecake had the option of strawberry (or raspberry?) or chocolate sauce to go with it but I hate unnecessary sauces on desserts so we took it plain. I think desserts should stand on their own without any sauce decorations/distractions, or at least put that crap on the side. We were pretty full by that point so we took the cheesecake to go & I actually ate my half for breakfast this morning.. Ya sometimes I have the eating habits of a five year old, don't judge!  Our server kept our drinks filled & checked on us regularly. Overall it was a good experience & hopefully it won't take me another 20 years to come back!",

It was not busy however, my steak was sent back two times due to it being served medium well and well done. And I do mean, well done and medium well after requesting medium. I sat and waited for my food as my lobster sat and waited with me. The manager Shannon came out and agreed and offered to cook another which happened but I'm still not satisfied, she became annoyed because after cutting three slices there was finally pink!  And I was told that was her best cook Fernando and that was medium. Nevermind, the remainder of the steak was well. Shannon told me my meal would be comped and it was, but I paid for my sweet tea. So after 2hrs and 30 minutes I finally ate, paid for a sweet tea and ate a well Steak.  Thanks Outback    Attached are the pictures of my steak showing me finally getting to the pink and the amount of steak gone to get to the center pink of the meat.",

    "text": "Had a great time at lunch. I had just gotten back from a long trip and we stoped by to grab something before going shopping. Server was very nice and friendly. It was very empty when we arrived but filled up once we left. The host sat us immediately and even asked if we wanted the blinds opened or closed (no one has ever asked me that so it was nice) Our waitress like I said was nice, and brought our drinks and bread out promptly. The meals took awhile but not long and were very good. The wedge salad was large and fed two people and the burgers were amazing! Compared to the outback near our home, it was 300% better. Every aspect of it! The restaurant was clean, nice atmosphere, good food, and great service. It nothing to write home about but if you like outback this is a good one.",

    "text": "I believe this was my worst restaurant experience ever. We arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday. After waiting an hour and a half for a table with two kids we were really hungry. We ordered a bloomin' onion and, it took about 20 minutes for that to arrive. It was the smallest, most pitiful little thing, undercooked and barely breaded. We ate it, and didn't complain. We proceeded to wait another hour for our food. Our waitress was kind but it was obviously out of her hands. When our food arrived, three out of four meals were literally refrigerator cold and the fifth meal (my 6 year olds chicken tenders) just didn't show up. My 5 year old didn't have his fries and my dad had a \"loaded\" baked potato with nothing on it. We got our food back, and then waited another 15 minutes for the chicken tenders. By the time we received them it was 9 pm and my daughter was so tired she had lost her appetite, and we were done with our meals. Not to mention the over cooked liver, I mean steak, and the extremely small salmon that were also laid on our table presented as a \"serving\". After complaining they did take care of our bill. Our poor waitress was doing the best she could but the tables around us were all having similar problems. Save yourself 4 hours and go somewhere else!",

We ordered a mini shake and received a 5 ounce milk glass, hardly worth the price. We suggested to the manager that one should be warned when receiving a drink this side thus giving them the option to order something else.   Our main dinner was not received as ordered. The  mashed potatoes were received fifteen minutes after the meal and I actually finished my hamburger before the ketchup arrived. The buffalo shrimp was horrible. The service was horrible, our waiter had two speeds : slow and stop. The manager did apologize and reduces our meal by 50%, but I'm not feeling good about returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "We love Outback. I'd say in the 10-12 years we've eaten there, it's been consistantly wonderful. Except for the last few times we've eaten at this location. We did call ahead seating, which is always a plus. We had a party of 8 for my birthday celebration. The waitress was accommodating, but the food was lackluster-very unusual. Our knives weren't clean either. In a steak oriented restaurant, I think the knives should shine! Our cheese fries came out and were chewy, like they'd sat under a heat lamp for a while. And the blooming onion looked as if it had been found under the sea. What an unusually tiny onion. We took the appetizers as is, voiced our opinion and ate them because we were so hungry.  The odd thing with out entrees was, our waitress tried to explain to us that a party of 8 had to have their order split in two. Therefore, half of the table got their food a good 5-8 minutes before the other half. Really? That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. And mind you, this location wasn't busy. I assumed that they must be short staffed in the kitchen. That's still a dumb thing to do. The waitress was very attentive and we spent a lot of money tonight, and we tipped well. But I think unless we're desperate, we'll just go to our home Outback, located in Matthews. We only came here to help our parents not have to travel as far. Please Outback, stop screwing with a good thing. Stop messing with the menu and start incentivizing (sp?) employees to stay.",

The waiter (a guy- don't remember his name) was really helpful; answered all of our questions with no issues and seemed happy to do so.
