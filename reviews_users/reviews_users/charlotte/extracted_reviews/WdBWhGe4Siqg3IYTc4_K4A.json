Our server was attentive so that really boosted the experience. I got the Crazy Chris which is basically a buffalo chicken wrap. Again it was fine. Not the best buffalo chicken but not the worst. I asked for a side of ranch which I was told costed extra, that's fine. Without the extra ranch the wrap would have been bland at best. I also got the wrap with a side of chips. What I was expecting was some homemade chips but what i got was a bag of ruffles. If you're going to just use store bought chips at least put them on the plate and pretend you made them. I probably won't make an effort to come back to Macado's but if i find myself there for another business meeting I'll be just fine.",

This time around, it wasn't so bad. I ordered the titanic with the French dip to dunk it in. Last time it took forever for the food to come out, but this time it was around 10 min.   The food was pretty fresh, and they have a lot of choices in sandwiches. Take your time and read all the combinations. This restaurant is also neatly located right near campus, and their drinks aren't too bad. Depending on what you're trying to drink and what is for the special this place isn't bad.  I had two coronas (2.95 on Wednesdays) so yeah, not bad.",

So first, 2 hostesses greeted me and I was seated promptly in the bar area.  Kinda reminds me of Ale House or Benigans.  Bartender took my order and advised me that burger would take 10-15 minutes which is greatly appreciated when you're at lunch and need to be somewhere in an hour, mainly work.  Bacon cheeseburger with coleslaw came out in 8 minutes, burger cooked to my specifications and coleslaw is vinegar based and not syrup based, yum. She checked on me once which is how it should be (promptly got my spicy mustard) and left me alone to eat. Burger was large and tasty, my only issue would be that the bacon was well, limp. I would like my bacon crispy please.  All in all a surprisingly good lunch choice in the University area and I'll be back.",

    "text": "I just left Macado's with my family and I was very impressed with the food it was hot and everything was very tasty. We had the Fried Pickles, Potato Wedges, Quesadillas, and some of the sandwiches.   The host greeted us with a smile and the waiter was very nice but I thought he lacked knowledge of the menu and when we asked what was good it's seemed as though he's never even eaten at the place.   The pricing was decent on avg $8 for a sandwich but they make up for it on the expensive sodas.  The menus are too large in size and very hard to read as has too many items and I doubt if the sandwiches vary that much in nature to have 50 plus sandwiches on a menu and for that reason I can't even remember the name of my sandwich.   The waiter didn't pick up one single dish while we was there so we ate with appetizer plates and trash on the table the entire time.   The decor in the place needs updating I think they would serve themselves better to spend some money on the interior and the exterior that looks like the 90s.   I heard this was a college spot that the students visit during the school year but in the summer time when families are out looking for a bite this place may get passed over simply because it doesn't look family friendly. Great food but yet the place was empty !   Overall I gave it a 3 stars but had the waiter picked up the plates and had knowledge or suggestions for a first time customer and the decor was better I would of gave it a 4 or 5 star for the food alone it was so delicious.",

The last visit was very disappointing we always order waters and this time was not an exception food took long like always. After finishing our meal and asking for the check realized they charged us for our daughters meal. When asking the waitress she said their was a minimum of 7 a person in order for my daughter to eat free. New rule? Well she just starred at us and wouldn't budge. Really? We just paid and left. But won't be going back. A heads up on the NEW RULE would have helped.",

We waited at least 5 minutes, if not longer, to even be greeted. I even watched/heard other servers ask whose table we were.  Our server was new, and knew NOTHING. She was very shy and nervous.   By the time we were greeted, we were ready to order, but had questions.   My boyfriend couldn't remember the name of the sandwich he had with roast beef (The Titanic, he gets it every time and loves it), but she didn't know either and thought it was under burgers.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, comes with garlic bread and a salad(chicken and garlic bread is so crispy and flavorful, and the salad is hearty and topped with bacons crumbles.) Luckily, I knew everything that came with it and knew my options, so I walked her through my own order, but I could tell she didn't know what to ask.   My boyfriend also asked her if Goose Island IPA was on tap still, which she had to go check (it wasn't on tap anymore), but came back with another beer suggestion and responded with \"whatever that is.\" He ended up just ordering a sweet tea, which he waited 45 mins for and ended up getting to go, along with our food because it wasn't ready yet.   Needless to say, we left angry because the service was slow and the server was not trained properly. When we got home, we also realized my boyfriend never got the potato salad he ordered. I'm giving it two stars just based on bad service.  The food is great, but I do think management needs to make sure their servers know the menu before they are on the floor, this visit almost ruined it for us.",

    "text": "After driving by Macado's countless times, we decided to give it a try on a rainy Sunday. At 1pm, it seemed relatively quiet. We were seated quickly; our server came over quickly and got our drink orders. She came back with the drinks and took our food orders. We ordered an appetizer of the warm pretzels; my dining companion ordered the black & blue salad; I ordered the pretzel dog.  After that, things went downhill. It took a while for our appetizer to show up (warm pretzels, not bad, 3.5/5 stars.) We finished them, we finished our drinks, and we sat. The table near us that was seated after us, and also ordered appetizers, was served their entree. We sat with empty drinks. We sat. And then we sat.   Eventually, our server showed up with our entrees, with a weird self-deprecating \"FINALLY! Here it is!\" It was strange, like she was acknowledging how frustrating it was that the food was slow, but not an apology. Odd. Since the menu said they served homemade chips, I had ordered my pretzel dog with chips. I figured they'd be homemade. It came with a bag of Ruffles. A bag of Ruffles is fine for a quick-stop deli, but this seemed like the sort of place where they'd at least put the chips on the plate. The pretzel dog was ... okay. The menu said \"1/4 lb dog\" and while I'm not going to weigh my food, this seemed smaller than that. The pretzel wrapped around the dog was tasty, but they'd put the whole thing on a grill for a while, so that one side of the pretzel had become dark and hard and barely edible.  The whole experience just seemed like the entire restaurant staff - the servers and the cook staff - were just phoning it in. I was disappointed - what I'd hoped would be a quick lunch ended up taking about an hour; the food was OK but nothing special. It's possible that they were having an off day, but frankly there are enough good dining options in the University area that I don't see a reason to return to give them another shot.",

Than we waited 30 minutes for our food, our waitress barely came to our table and when she did was so concerned about her friends at the other table didn't bother to check on us.. had to ask two other people for things such as silverware and ketchup. When we did get our foot it was so greasy I could barely even eat the potato chips that cost extra. Definitely will think twice before returning here.",

Their draft beer selection is modest, but they have some solid seasonal options. Come here on Tuesday nights and it's half off Hindenburgs (think club sandwich on steroids). Thursday nights is 2 for 1 appetizers. Lots of locals come here (mainly UNC Charlotte students). Not the type of place you want to come to if you're looking for a quiet dinner and drinks; especially during sports events.",

They basically take a HUGE margarita glass and fill it with beer.  High visual impact, plus the beer you normally drink seems daunting when it comes out.  I decided on a burger and was pleasantly surprised when it didn't fall apart on me halfway through due to greasiness.  The food did take a while to come out - mostly my fault since I was the only one that ordered something hot... everyone else's sandwiches were cold.  Overall, the server and the whole experience was a good one.  I'll be back to tackle another margarita glass of beer someday!",

When she handed me the check I asked if others had complained about the salad and she said yes. She said she didn't take it off the bill but could send the manager out. I said it was fine just maybe provide a gift certificate for next time. She went to talk to the manager and came back and said he wouldn't do anything because I ate some of the salad.  (I ate the chicken on top and left the rotten lettuce) she went to get the manager and came back with a 5$ coupon. Salad was $10. There were at least 4 others in the restaurant that had rotten lettuce, after the first complaint they should have removed the other rotten salads from their restaurant rather than wait for the complaints to come in! Just horrible management by the way the rotten lettuce was hidden on the bottom of the salad. Bathrooms were disgustingly dirty and soap and faucets didn't function properly. All signs of a poorly managed restaurant. I imagine their profitability is really poor based on the number of times I did see the manager come out.  Please go with caution!",

    "text": "Came here to order takeout for my family on Saturday and it was delicious indeed. We ordered: 2 pastrami ruben, one with coleslaw the other with fries, a turkey ruben with coleslaw, an oriental chicken wrap with coleslaw, a rabbit (chicken salad) wrap with potato salad, a kids chicken fingers plate and a cinnamon roll. The order was ready in 30 minutes as promised but when I got there the hostess was a bit disheveled and overwhelmed with seating, cookie baking, communicating to the other hostess and handling takeout orders. Maybe I just came in at the wrong time but it may be beneficial to reroute the takeout orders or have a dedicated takeout person to avoid any service breaks. She started to help me twice and had to stop to complete the aforementioned task. Unfortunately, it wasn't the speedy takeout experience of other eateries.   The food was really good though. The Rubens were good overall but they were a bit chintzy on the meat, kraut and dressing and the bread was overly toasted (but not burnt). The wraps were both chocked full of all of the toppings and meat and were fresh and served on a slightly grilled tortilla. These were shining stars indeed. The kids meal was also a bit chintzy but honestly it's a kids plate. All the sides were homemade and super fresh.   Let me tell you about this cinnamon bun...OMG IT WAS FABULOUS!! So fresh and pillowy with the right balance of sweet and cinnamony flavor. I literally wanted to drive back to get 20 more!!! Absolutely fabulous!!",

Those pretzels are fantastic and probably the best value on the entire huge menu. $4.25 for 3 giant soft pretzels with a vat of nacho cheese. The person I was with got some kind of wrap and that person said it was great. Many, many options on this menu.  Staff: perhaps the worst staff I have ever seen in my life. NICE but just lost and clueless. We were seated and then waited 17 minutes before I had to flag down a staff member just to order drinks. We likely would have been there waiting forever, had I not. We were told there was a mix-up of who was covering table. When we did eventually get a waitress and order the 3 menu items I mentioned above, somehow the waitress only relayed 2 of our items to the kitchen. So we found out when our two entrees came out that she never put our basket of pretzels in (they eventually were brought out after she later put the order in). Wanting to leave before we had any more issues, we gave them our card. When the receipt came back, they had charged our credit card about twice the amount of the original check we were given...(they ran the card on another table's more expensive check). So we had to spend more time waiting for them to cancel one transaction and put the correct one through. Again...we ordered 3 menu items and had all these problems...I did hear the people at the table next to us also have a problem getting a staff member to their table at one point. I couldn't tell whether our waitress was bad, or if it was the entire staff that night but that was rough.  Come for the food, don't expect much from staff.",

I went late night (which is nice to find a place open at 11 and up for those of us who work in hospitality and like to have a drink after. First, our water came with out the lemons. The server said \"oh oops I forgot your lemons, oh well\" and never brought us any... we went for the margs because they sounded good. Flavor options and everything. We should have known by the $3 and something that they cost, they would be no good. So much flavor mix it was really sweet. And the salt rim tasted like table salt and just did not go well with the over sweet drink. We then moved on to another drink. I got a beer(can't go wrong) my friend got the salted caramel martini which had us drooling just reading it. It comes out with half a martinis glass's worth and again, table salt rim. I watched the bartender pour, and idk how their drinks are suppose to be made, but it was majority of butterscotch schnapps and light on the vodka. Again, making the drink entirely too sweet. Which obviously there should be some sweetness but this was over kill. Anywho, my friends built her own wrap and said it was okay. Like I said. Just an okay place. The location is perfect though (uncc) because I feel like college kids on a budget, that would eat anything, would like it here.",

Toppings tasted like they were burnt and burger patty tasted like it had just come out the the freezer.  Chicken wings tasted like the frozen kind that you buy at the grocery store.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?  The service was horrendous.  It took way too long for a server to show up at our table, and once he did, he was very unenthusiastic about his job.  Took a long time to get our drinks.  He came and asked several times what I was drinking to give me a refill(I was drinking unsweet tea) and 10 minutes or so later, he brings sweet tea.  Not a big deal, but his lackluster attitude left us less than impressed.  The place was nearly empty, so there's no excuse there.    I don't recommend this place and will never go back.",

Met a colleague here for lunch and I've stopped eating meat since my last visit. Wasn't sure I'd find anything. BUT the fish tacos were DELICIOUS! There's also a shrimp taco I want to try next time. It was actually fried cod and came with a wasabi dressing. Unfortunately I had to have my tacos remade without the dressing, I just couldn't do it. My request was easily accommodated and quickly. Two tacos came with my entree with a mound of fries. My colleague had a salad that he said was out of this world. It was huge but he had no problem finishing it.  This is a great lunch spot for a couple reasons: 1)if you have an hour lunch you can get in and out easily while sitting in nice cushy seats being served 2)easy on the pockets 3) great food  I'll be back.",

I'm temporarily disabled, so I ordered enough food to feed  me for 2 days. There was a $15 or $20 minimum anyway. Delivery was prompt.  The \"Bowl\" of French Onion Soup Au Grautin, was 1/4 cup of onions in beef broth. I assume \"Au Grautin\" meant with cheese, never had French onion soup without it. Maybe the \"Au Grautin\" in the description was bragging? Does French Onion Soup Au Grautin really mean \"Sans Gratin\"?   No idea what a \"cup\" of soup would be served in. A thimble? On to the grilled chicken salad. Sigh. Wilted old lettuce, a few stray bits of tomatoes and a few other things. The chicken pieces were obviously old, overcooked, dried leftovers. I tried cutting it up for my dog. (Truth). One piece must have been pure gristle or something. It would not cut with a steak knife.  I did get the other pieces cubes. She was offended by my offering, and staged a food strike. Fearing permanent disability, I tossed the salad....in the trash.  2 outs, 1 to go, bottoms of the 9th. The wings looked good! Remember that old saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\". Confirmed as a valid warning. The wings were undercooked and fatty. I could not eat them. Paid around $20, plus $5 cash tip for delivery. Ate cheesecrakers for 2 days.",

The most notable thing is their crazy-extensive menu...it'd be fun to come back and try more of their items, especially their specialties. I went on wing night, and I had a hankering for wings, and let me tell you - their wings can hit the spot. I was pleasantly surprised to find their spicy thai sauce is indeed /quite/ spicy - I needed a ranch to finish it - unexpected, given the nature of the place. I got a second order of BBQ, also, because why not - each order is only $4.50 - and that was a ton of food (I finished maybe half of each).  Mozzarella sticks were, as always, tasty and overpriced. Drinks were solid and decently priced. Overall, a pleasant experience - just nothing that stood out as a trademark.",

Good food, but I won't be back because I would like to preserve my arteries and waistline.",

    "text": "Macado's is a great place to stop for a quick and casual bite and/or drink if you're in the area. It's the only nice-ish sit down restaurant in that shopping center unless you want to walk into Hardee's lol. It's classic American style cuisine, burgers, sandwiches, wings, salads, etc. I usually get the cashew chicken salad or the oriental salad with chicken or shrimp. Their salad portions are HUGE let me tell you! My boyfriend loves the Dietrich delight sandwich. It's good to know they deliver with ubereats which is what I usually will do if I want something easy and worth it and good. Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that the ingredients are fairly generic, (are put together well though, and are appropriate for the price)",

Well I came on a Monday night at about 9:15pm or so for some wings, as I know it's a big and busy night for them then. I figured food would be a wait and I was okay with that, however our server-- MADISON S decided to just completely ignore MY TABLE a 2 top of females and not even asked if we needed another bar drink or if we were okay. Mind you, there was half an empty restaurant.. the bartender was just sitting down at the bar with a friend talking & eating ... I asked to speak with manager spoke with ADAM, HE WAS GREAT. Adam was very polite and attended to our needs. Adam assured our food would he there shortly, however food never came.. after almost 2HOURS WE GOT OUR FOOD! Let me add, after I spoke with manager (Adam) the server ignored us the entire time until our food came out. Madison S has the worst attitude. Look-- I work in restaurant. I'm okay with food being delayed,  but not bad service. Get your attitude together, Maddison S.   Pictures listed are empty drinks and bartender on far right sitting down eating with a whole bar!! Unbelievable.",

The bread that came on the soup always comes out cold, which is strange since it's covered in melted cheese.

    "text": "Disappointing. I have fond memories of Macado's in Boone during my college days and more recently at Concord Mills before they closed but this visit did little to compare with those locations. The first thing that I noticed upon entering was the temperature. I don't know if the a/c was broken but I was shortly sweating. The next clear observation was that we were the only other diners not at the bar. Granted it was an early Tuesday night but still, not a great sign. Our waitress greeted us and I confirmed with her that it was kids night and a dollar off schooner night. We ordered the bean and queso app.She took our orders and was on her way. Let me preface my food review by first saying that I believe that there's a difference between bad food and poor preparation. With this situation, I believe it to be the latter. To begin, our queso app. was cold in the center. Clearly a simple post microwave test would have confirmed this. It was burger night so I decided to try the spicy option with jalapenos and nacho cheese. The burger was bland and over cooked. The fries were clearly frozen not too long ago and had no seasoning. The Ty Cob wrap was flavorless and could have been made easily at home. The child's pasta was a canned sauce poured over noodles. The child's chicken fingers were over cooked in the frier.  When we received the bill, I noticed that our waitress had had charged for extra sauce without mentioning to us that there would be an additional charge add she had the kids meals and my beer listed at regular price. Maybe she gets away with that with college kids. I don't normally go into this much detail in my reviews but I am hoping that someone from Macado's will read this and start caring. I don't want to lose the last local location that we have.  Sometimes it's just the simple things.",

I thought it was very nice of the waitress to be accommodating since they were close to closing. It was quiet in here. It has a bar side and a dining room side which I thought was a nice touch. Everyone said their food was good, pretty good, and excellent. I was pleasantly surprised when the cook came out and asked if we needed anything (even if he was making sure we didn't so he could bounce) it was still nice of him nonetheless. The price was decent and we would check this place out again.",

    "text": "At first the menu selection can seem overwhelming, especially the sandwiches. My trick was to identify the sandwich components I really wanted and ignore any sandwich without them. I got my sandwich on a plain bagel which was a great choice. Food came out lukewarm, but that could have been due to the relay caused by my dates food. They brought them out at the same time which I give kudos for at least. My meal also came with chips, which they gave me just in a bag (the promised pickle was nowhere to be found). I had assumed that the chips given would be the same as the homemade chips they offer on their appetizer menu, but that was my mistake. Highly recommend adding on the French onion dip with the chips. My date ordered the Kings sandwich (toasted croissant w/choc. icecream)  Service was a tad slow, our booth felt a little tucked away so our server didn't visit as often, but overall she did a good job. At the end of our meal we were approached by someone soliciting donations for their charity. We were unsure if they were from the restaurant or just was a customer fishing for sales. Felt a little uncomfortable with the whole exchange.  Overall the restaurant had a casual atmosphere with various pop culture memorabilia (mostly music in the section we were sat at). Pricing was good for a college budget which I appreciated (sandwiches between $7.95-$9.98)I would definitely come back to try more of the menu.  Edit: after a visit to the bathrooms, they were definitely in need of a cleaning. 3/5 toilets had brown film around the seat, and my stall had some sort of red syrup stains and a boot print on the wall. One of the faucet handles wouldn't stay up and on, and kept shutting off, so there was only one viable sink.",

    "text": "We've been coming here for years. It was always a great place to take out of state guests due to the huge menu and great drink selections. But honestly, over the last 6 months it has seriously started to go downhill.   Every time you walk in there are dirty and uncleared tables. The waitresses/waiters are extremely slow with serving you. They do not know the menu so if you have a question, they are of no help. My husband guzzles down water and he never once was able to get his water filled. Where was our waitress? Who knows.   Food: The chicken parm tasted like boil in a bag. The noodles were hard, the sauce wasn't even sauce- it was tomato paste and the whole meal was cold.   I ordered pretzels and some spots were soft and chewy and other parts were hard and cold. Served with beer cheese that was ice cold. I asked the waitress if beer cheese was supposed to be served warm and she literally replied \"I don't know.\" So I asked her if she could bring me some warm cheese, which she did about 5 whole minutes later.   They used to serve meals with homemade chips but now instead give you a prepackaged bag of Ruffles. If you want their homemade chips, it is now only available as an appetizer.   Also, this latest time we visited (Saturday 4/21), my husband ordered a burger. 48 hours he has not left our bathroom floor. He has literally had his head hung in the toilet for the last 2 days. I called and spoke to the manager who offered gift cards, which we quickly denied. I requested we get our money back from our Saturday's visit and apparently i need to call corporate to do so. The manager is unable to refund us on our card.   Unfortunately, we will no longer be customers at this establishment. Please proceed with caution if you choose to eat here.",

They forgot the broccoli, so I asked for it and they brought 3 dry, tiny broccoli florets for me to add. Not enjoyable. We got a fruit cup, with fruit that wasn't fresh either. On the bright side, the shrimp appetizer was good with 10 nice sized shrimp. I'm glad we got the shrimp otherwise it would have been a total let down.",

It can be quite the hang out for UNCC college kids, but it's also family style so anyone fits. My favorite thing on the menu is probably the 49er burger, with the avocado it makes for a tasty treat, normally I pair that with their house made chips which are to die for. Most of my friends op for the black bean dip, and the quesadillas are great! Like I said the menu and food is amazing!!! The only down side to Macados is the TERRIBLE service. Waiters come take your order and then you never see them again. They don't fill up your drinks, and they really are not very attentive to their customers. I feel like I can personally say that their service is so horrid because I worked in the food industry as a server, and I've been on the consumer side. It's not fun getting a bad tip but it's also not fun dying of thirst. I would gladly give this place 5 stars if the service was up to par!!",

Macado's is one of those places you'd imagine existing as an \"American\" restaurant in a foreign country.  Its walls are tiled with every bit of stereotypical kitsch imaginable from rock and roll to sports to fake antique carousel horses.  There are big TVs everywhere -- like, two 4' TVs literally right next to each other on the wall showing the exact same thing (maybe so you can cross your eyes and get 3D?).  The food is what you'd expect from a place like that -- mainly enormous, messy, meat sandwiches.  They're OK but nothing that's going to make you say \"OMG I have to hit up Macado's and get that amazing totally unique giant meat sandwich again\".  If you want competently prepared, bland, non-adventurous food, in an environment that makes you feel like it's 1984 again and you're on top of the world, this may just be your place.",

Dark wood covers the bar and tables with flat screen TV's scattered throughout the restaurant.  We went during a down-time at about 2:00.  Our server was friendly, and our food was delivered correctly and relatively fast.  As a vegetarian, I will say that they menu is not very friendly.  I really had to look for veggie options.  I selected the portabello quesadilla and it was terrific.  I was skeptical about broccoli being in my quesadilla but I took a chance and really liked it.  I also had a side of coleslaw which was a bit unusual.  It almost has a mesquite flavor to it.  It wasn't bad but I am a more traditional fan.  Friday's they also offer half price glasses of house wine.  I fully took advantage of some pretty decent cab.    Overall, this is a casual, good, decently priced place.

I was seated towards the back of the restaurant where I couldn't really see people or the front door, which was kind of awkward because it was pretty empty in there. My server was nice, but he did get missing for long periods of time, possibly because I was sitting so far away from everyone else. The only catch was that ranch & blue cheese was 75 cents apiece. I don't mind paying extra for ranch, but it's kind of ridiculous that it cost twice as much as the wings, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Macado's.",

The table was so dirty everyone had to avoid touching it, nothing happened after telling the waiter and them saying they would take care of it. After getting our food and eating for 6 minutes I reminded them about the table and told them don't waste their time. We are already eating. He seemed to be very pleased that he wouldn't have to do anything about it. My drink was taken from the table and did not return for  a long period of time. I didn't have but, one napkin that was designed for under a drink. The chicken in my \"KC's Mac and Cheese\" felt like it was 3 day old left overs reheated twice over. The only redeeming feature was the garlic bread which probably only tasted good because it was frozen and not prepared by the staff here other than reheating.",

It is served with tortilla chips, and was pretty yummy! After debating the large menu (I wanted pretty much everything they had), I ordered the Big Daddy. It exceeded expectations! I could only finish half of it, so I have leftovers for today. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We heard this place is great and I was pretty excited to try it out. The menu seemed pretty extensive and many options to choose from. We took our baby with us and I was disappointed and appalled to find there was no changing table in either of the restrooms. Although it may not be everyone's go-to family restaurant, I am amazed how a business this popular would not accommodate parents and families. The food was average or even could have been above average but the experience was not awesome--we saw our server when we placed the order and then when he came around to hand us the check-- that's it! We did not feel very welcome, we would probably have had more interaction with our server at a fast food restaurant. Not impressed with the customer service  and to top it all the experience was ruined when i had to change my baby in his car seat/stroller. Not cool Macado's, not cool.",

If the food was good, this restaurant would be one of my absolute favorites. This place needs to increase the quality of their ingredients. Very sub-par restaurant.",

    "text": "Was very upset with our experience tonight. We love it here normally. We wanted something late-night seeing as how I'm in the service industry and don't get off work until 10pm or later. We check the times online and it says they're open til 12:30am. We arrive at 11:15pm and check the hours on the door that say open until 12:30am, but the door was locked. We go in through the bar and all the stools were up. There were about 5 different groups of people sitting in booths or standing at the bar. The bartender promptly informs us they're closed. When I ask when do they close on Wednesdays she says normally 12:30 am but they didn't have enough business to stay open. Yet there were at least ten customers just in the bar area. If they have varying closing hours it should be specified online and on their door. From working in restaurants for 6 years I know that they don't close early while there are customers still dining/drinking AND over an hour early.  Thanks for the wasted trip.",
