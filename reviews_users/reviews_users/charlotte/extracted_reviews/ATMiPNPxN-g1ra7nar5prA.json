    "text": "First I need to say that the foods and services were EXCELLENT. It is definitely a place where you go when your company is paying because the Entrees were all in $30+ range. However, I ordered Ahi Tuna Skewers from Small Plate section and it was delicious and enough for me especially when combined with my Crab Cakes appetizer.   The ambiance of the resturant is very masculine with dark wood paneling and Men's club type decorations. Not a place for a romantic dinner unless you're planning on talking about your Pre-Nup arrangement. If you're dining out with your business associates over 40 years old, this is the place to go.  Two of my colleagues ordered Steaks and said that they were cooked perfectly.",

    "text": "My family and I had dinner here tonight during Restaurant Week. Our thinking was that we could try it to see if we liked it enough to warrant going back. What a disappointment!!! I would HIGHLY suggest not going here during Restaurant Week, which is a shame. The portions appeared to be smaller than usual, the room was overcrowded, food quality suffered, and our service was not great either. I doubt I will be going back to this restaurant and would NOT suggest it. I will expand on all of the above...  I have a feeling their food quality suffered from normal bc of the lower prices and higher demand/levels of customers during rest. week. My NY Strip was tough, and not warm when I received it although it was cooked properly/as requested (med. rare). I have had much better steaks at much less expensive places. Calamari appetizer was overly tough and the portion size was humorous. Ice cream for dessert?  Should have passed. VERY poor quality on the ice cream and my wife's cheesecake was no different. My ice cream was the lowest quality bland vanilla I've had in a long time, not to mention it was half melted when I got it. Her salmon was the best thing that hit our table (party of 7) the entire meal. That's not usually what you want to hear about a steak house, particularly one with a $500 tab.  Service was (to me) probably the worst part about the meal. It was a combined lack of effort that had to do with management, kitchen and service staff. The list below highlights some of the things... -Took 15 min to get my first coca-cola after the rest of our group already had drinks (we all ordered them at the same time). Then I received one refill over the 3 courses of my meal (2 hours) and went most of my meal and after-dinner conversation with an empty glass. Inexcusable even in cheap chain restaurants. -Side dishes came 5 min before the entrees. Not appetizers which were actually timely just not presented to the right people. Side dishes came 5 minutes before the entrees. Unreal. -Then the entree plates were presented to the wrong seats and items were mixed on wrong persons plates. (Scallops with the wrong steak.) -Desserts took 30 min after the table had been bussed from entrees and so forth for no apparent reason which usually means the server messed up somewhere. -then my sister-in-law had to remind our server that she never received hers and also did not receive her dessert until the entire rest of our party was finished with theirs.  This experience was the absolute last thing I expected from a reputable establishment like Flemmings. I'm extremely disappointed. Oh... And they don't sell/make sweet tea.",

The portions were a little on the petite side for the veggies but that is always the case at pretentious places like these.

    "text": "Very disappointed by the liquor selection. Woodford reserve should not be your top shelf bourbon.  I can get that for 7.00 at a dive bar.   And no, booker's is nothing to write home about either  This steak was the fifth or sixth best (not a bragging point at this price point) I have had in Charlotte The wife and I both agreed that a restaurant week steak at Ruth Chris killed Flemings at half the price.  A steak at 131 Main was also superior for far less. The wife argues that I can do better on our infrared grill with a good butcher cut.  Also disappointed in portion size. Steak was adequate, but the asparagus on the side was literally 4 or 5 small pieces  When my 120 lb wife complains about portion size...we have a problem.  We ordered appetizers, sides, desert and were not full.  Good service and decent atmosphere. The carrot cake was worth writing home about.  This was our highlight for the night  I left Ruth Chris wanting to come back.  I will also return to 131 main When wanting a steak. I left Flemings missing my $200 and promising to convince friends to go elsewhere.  The laundry list of positive reviews below refer mostly to happy hour.  We went for dinner. The reviewers that say this is the best steak in Charlotte have not been to Del Friscos or Ruth Chris or Sullivan's....or anywhere else a steak runs more than $20  ....now I have to take my wife somewhere else for a 'special dinner' as this one 'did notcount'",

The caesar salad was great, my 3 crab cakes were very very good. As they were filled with lots of crab! (they should be that way) My family also ordered sides as additions to our meal. We got mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. They were decent sized for 4 people to share off of. Lastly, for dessert I got raspberry sorbet which was great and refreshing. Overall, I really loved this place and would go there again. Next time I will try the steak and see if it tops Ruth Chris. ;)",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible. We have been to Flemings before and frequent high end stake houses but this experience was by far the WORST! We planned a lovely family gathering and it started by half of our table not being able to order their desired drink because the bar was out of SEVERAL items, then when we ordered our meals the same thing happened, half our table wasn't able to order their desired item. I ordered my steak medium plus and it came out an hour later and ICE cold, I asked the waiter to see if they could hear it up, he brought it back 30 minutes later, I could tell it was the same steak because I saw the bite I had cut off it previously. I cut into the center to make sure it was cooked to my preference and it was raw inside and burnt to a crisp outside. I acknowledged it to the waiter and he was COMPLETELY rude and acted as though it was MY problem and I need to find the solution to fix it. I like going out to nice restaurants and spending more to do so but this experience was COMPLETELY inappropriate. We asked to speak to the manager several times and he never even came over. This is no way to treat customers. I highly urge you to spend your money elsewhere were you will be appreciated and respected.",

The ambiance was nice, comfortable, and laid-back.  They had a nice \"specialty drink\" section and I enjoyed the wine by the glass selection, very thorough.  We had a waiter and waitress and they were on the top of their game, great service is always a plus.    The negative started with the appetizer, rubbery calamari.  When eating good calamari you should be able to bite through it, you should not have to chew it.  The sweet chili sauce and peppers were a nice touch and had good flavor, but the meat of the dish \"calamari\" was a poor showing.  If you're looking for a great calamari appetizer go to Dressler's, they know how to do it right.  Now on to the steaks.  My fiance ordered the PORCINI RUBBED FILET MIGNON, heavily seasoned with salt and pepper.  According to her, some bites were so salty it was hard to enjoy.  I know the bite she gave me was super salty and not enjoyable.  I ordered the Bone-In Blackened Ribeye with 3 oysters, nice crust and cooked to order, MR.  I enjoyed my steak, but have enjoyed better.  The experience was nothing to write home about, but it was worth giving all you yelpers a heads up.

We really couldn't tell who our waiter really was as 2 of them kept working our table.  The food was good, and it gets 4 stars.  We enjoyed the crab cakes, each enjoyed our salads (house & wedge), and enjoyed great steaks cooked and flavored just right.  Service - 2 stars; as the service was very casual; waiters never introduced themselves;  the food runner failed to remove the appetizer plates when he brought the salads.

I really don't want to waste my time writing this but I must write a few things - the server didn't know special offer was extended nor did he ever read/tell us the menu; Everything was inaudible; the asparagus was too cooked to the point that the tips were so dry it tasted like grass; only had medium cooked steak left which were tasteless; creme brulee top was too hard; the cheesecake tasted like goatmilk; the server made us wait forever before picking up our payment; and worst of all, never even seemed apologetic. We basically didn't finish or box half of the food. Oh and we were sat on a table with dead lightbulb which they acknowledged but did nothing. The servers behind us were talking and laughing too loud too. Terrible place.",

We started off with the French onion soup and the burrata. They were both very good but if you are between the two I would say go for the burrata. It was so creamy and delicious. For my main course I ordered the filet mignon Oscar style with jumbo lump crab meat and my mom got the New York strip. My boyfriend was going to go for the prime rib dinner but the waiter convinced him to get a real steak so he got the prime dry aged New York strip and boy was he glad he did. We also got a side of the truffle mashed potatoes which were incredible. We left very full and happy. Definitely a great place and we can't wait to head back !",

    "text": "My party placed a reservation for late evening which was honored,  we were promptly seated.  Service seemed mostly OK for a bustling environment,  every table was full. Our drink order was promptly taken.    One of the early warning signs for me:  instant ice tea and no draft beer,  strange for this scale of operation.  Our orders were promptly taken,  and we waited.  And we waited... our orders were served an hour later.  Of course my party all ordered steaks and we all ordered them \"medium\".  This is where things became concerning.    We had two steaks in the party that would be considered well done,  one that perhaps was bordering on medium-well, and one that was... Raw.  Cutting into it we found a cold bloody center.  Remember we all ordered at the same time and the same  - medium.  Alerting the staff to this,  no one seemed surprised or apologetic.  They offered to put it back on the grill.  And it emerged twenty minutes later about right.  By this point we are on an hour and twenty for one of our party to be served.  Let's also look at the preparation of the steaks - they are all quite oily.  These have been prepared in the grand Waffle House style.... I unfortunately can say I have had better steaks at discount late night operations,  these just aren't good,  a disappointment considering the restaurants menu prices.  The sides,  a good variety of vegetables,  all are quite good and well prepared.  Overall,  this is a place you go for steak,  and bottom line I can get a better steak anywhere at 20-30% of the prices here.  If I want a premium steak I will make sure to go to one of the areas more predictable.  In summary -   -Service, not bad,  but nothing mind blowing either.  -Drinks,  suspect.  In the south we don't expect instant mango tea.  Beers not on draft.  Stick to wine,  they have a decent respectable wine list.  -Food,  sides of which we ordered half of the menu,  we're all respectable - quite good.  A stark contrast to the main course experience,  which was the opposite - very poor.  I saw other reviews that were either good or bad,  this one is hit or miss and we likely hit it when the wrong crew was in the kitchen.  Unacceptable at any restaurant let alone of this price level.",

    "text": "This place looks like ever other steak house across the South and mid west. Black napkins brown leather low light. The wine list is just Ok but they offer a pour that is nearly a half bottle which is different. The sides come in full and half sizes which are still big. The stag is friendly and far from pushy. However at the end of the day it is a steak house so it all comes down to one thing the steaks. They have a classic cuts of mostly in aged beef and the classic steak house sides and fish options. I got the NY Strip which was priced in line with comparable spots. None of that really seems 5 star worthy yet, right?  Here why they deserve 5 stars; the steak was thick cut and probably a bit over the Oz stated raw when cut. Very little gristle and tail fat. I ordered mine 'rare' with an extra char and it was cooked absolutely perfectly. It was searing hot on the outside down to a cool raw centre. This is always how I order strip but this is one of the few times that the steak had great flavour and was actually cooked how rare is supposed to be. Despite the many unremarkable things about this place the steak and service are what a steak house are really all about and this laid back place served one of the best steaks I have ever had.",

With these prices, I expect to be wowed.  Customer service will keep me coming back to a restaurant time and time again.  There was nothing about the customer service that said 'we want you to choose us over any other steakhouse in town'.  Our server appeared uninterested in us, simply going through the motions.  It wasn't bad service...just not what I would expect if I'm going to spend the money to dine there.   We had lamb chops, prime rib, crab cakes, sweet chile calamari, the mushroom ravioli, truffle mashed potatoes and chocolate lava cake/carrot cake for dessert.  Everything was delicious, just not a wow.  I eat calamari as an appetizer everywhere I go, there's is definitely in the top 5.   There are just too many steakhouses in Charlotte for me to return unfortunately.  At least put a smile on your face when you come to our table.",

I had the ribeye with mac and cheese green beans & mashed potatoes. The meat was tender, flavorful, and ultimately not sharable. Dare I say, more flavorful than Ruth Chris's ribeye. Sides are big enough to share and I had one the best bread pudding deserts there hands down, but they don't usually serve it. Not a heavy alcohol drinker but the wine selection appeared decent. For the financially challenged make this trip during lunch. For those looking for a great anniversary dinner not a bad way to show the one you love your not as cheap as you really are. For the daters, I have no advice , I'm only taking the wife here she has earned it (man that sounds so wrong but feels to right to say it).

I started with a tomato and mozzarella salad, which is very hard to mess up, so it was very good.  Then I had the bone-in ribeye, with sides of fleming's potatoes (au gratin with cheddar and jalapenos) and sauteed spinach.  The steak quality is excellent, perfectly cooked and very tender.  The sides were also done very nicely.  For dessert I had the lemon gingersnap pie, which was also very good.  But the most impressive thing about Fleming's was the service.  Immediately after placing our orders, it seems like the waiter just walked back into the kitchen and grabbed our salads.  Once those plates were cleared, a runner was immediately at our table with our entrees and sides in hand.  Many fine dining restaurants will have you linger for hours over dinner, but this place has everything timed extremely well.  You definitely get what you pay for.",

The steak and the potatoes were done perfectly, however the Tuna was not what we expected.  I would not call it seared as much as I would say it waved hello at a pan on its way to the plate.  The entire thing was really cold - not cool - cold and the vinaigrette was over powering.   We sent it back with the same comments and asked for the topping on the side the next time which really helped.  Even the second time around the tuna could have been warmer but it had very good taste.  Entire meal with a couple of drinks was $130ish.

    "text": "Yummy!  Personally, I love a steakhouse bar, they always stock the favorite high end bourbons, tequila and scotches poured over scotch rocks that I appreciate and you can enjoy a great ribeye in a more casual environment of the bar versus the white linen clothed tables and candlelight.   It was my first time in Flemings and I was initially impressed by the adoption of technology - menus for cocktails & wines were on tablets at the bar - score. Wine selection is great but personally I enjoyed my Blanton's bourbon over a scotch rock.   Ribeye - 11oz was ON POINT! They prepared it to perfection with a black & white peppercorn rub with a side of spicy green beans.   The appetizers were cool, the calamari was a large portion and had a sweet & sour flavoring but honestly it got boring quick.  The ribeye and green beans were my highlight of the trip - and the bartender who was very helpful.",

A nice hot meal prepared for me to indulge in. Although I'd prefer to be accompanied by a guest not all people like to splurge on food. My experience is worth the coins spent.

Not much taste at all.   The short rib that was brought was very tender but also lacked flavor. Maybe it was because it was during Queens Feast week.

I will preface this review by saying that our 1st  time here, we ate in the main dining room and had a great experience so, my gripe is really about the bar (which we visited the last 2 times). We stopped in the bar for a bite before one of the pre-season Panthers game and felt like we were not wanted. The staff acted irritated that we were there and were not attentive at all, but we sucked it up. When we hesitantly walked in few weeks ago, we were literally the first ones to sit at the bar because they had just opened. I think we were there for about 5 min before we got up and left. Absolutely no acknowledgement was made by the 2 bartenders....well, actually they did look at us as they were greeting their friends who sat down after. The 2nd experience left such a bad taste in our mouths that we didn't have the patience for a 3rd. We walked down to Chima and were greeted by a pretty busy bartender before we even sat down. My husband currently works in the restaurant industry and I worked as a server/hostess for 8 years so, we get it. This type of service two times in a row was just plain unacceptable and we will not be back.",

I do not give out five stars lightly, but I really struggled with a reason to lower it at all.  The decor is like you have come to expect from Fleming's across the country. It is clean, and cool. The staff was attentive and friendly through out the evening. Our server was knowledgable and provided helpful advice on food and drinks.  We started with some wine for the table. Our server made a solid recommendation that was well received by the group. I wish I remembered the name of the wine.  We started with a few appetizers. I tried the Pan-Crisped Pork Belly. The pork belly comes with creamy goat cheese grits and sweet onion chutney. Those three components combined for some good flavor.  For my meal I ordered the Main Filet Mignon medium rare. It came out as ordered. The meat was juicy and packed solid flavor. We had several sides for the table as well. As always I ate a lot of Fleming's Potatoes. They are fantastic. I also ate some of the sauteed corn. That was a pleasant surprise. The flavors and textures were very good. The last side I tried was the Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese. It was creamy and tasty. I was far too stuffed to order any dessert.",

Although the server looked out for us when we ordered and answered questions she never did check back in to see how our food was. I have learned I am just not a steakhouse person. My husband's hanger steak was pretty amazing though and for a \"small plate\" it might have been the same size as my entree.",

After being there for over 1.5 hours, we finally received our food (and only after reminding the staff that we weren't sitting there because we love their carpet and think they just have the darnest chairs in the world).  We were not asked if we wanted a wine refill until the 1.5 hour mark when we also asked them for the whereabouts of our food.  We received our food shortly thereafter, despite putting in our orders within 15 minutes of being seated.  There was no apology or explanation for why our food took so long, despite the tables around us being empty.  Our waters were only refilled once.  If not for the amazing company I was with, I would have left at the 1 hour mark.  Food wise.. I was not particularly hungry so I ordered a salad and a side dish (lobster tempura) as my main course.  I fully regret asking them to hold on bringing out the salad until everyone received their main dish.  My lobster tempura was really meh.  Like, really meh.  It reminded me of state fair food, where you find oreos/junk thrown into a batter of disgusting oil.  The portion for the lobster tails definitely looked big, but the oily crust was 75% of the plate.  Not worth the $27 price tag.  I will say that the portion for the steak looked bigger than advertised -- definitely a plus, but not enough to make up for the non-existent service.",

Well, I am happy to say that last nights experience was nothing short of spectacular.  Called to make reservations and informed them of said birthday.  While we were there no less than 5 employees besides our waiter stopped by to wish her a happy birthday.  Special right?  We were greeted by our server Jim.  He was great and part of the reason I like these \"Prime Steakhouses\".  He was a presenter if you know what I mean.  His descriptions of the dishes, and option were wonderful.  This guy knew more about dry vs. wet aging of meat than most and was a True salesman.  His service was wonderful throughout the evening, and exemplified what a True \"professional\" server should be.  Onto the meal.  Chilled seafood tower to start.  Usually I won't opt for the tower since it's somewhat intimidating.  But tonight I was out to impress....pull out all the stops.  They bring the tower which was chock full of fresh, chilled goodness.  Lobster, Stone Crab Claws, King Crab Claws and the largest, freshest most delicious shrimp ever.  WOW.  The only think missing was oysters, but the shrimp made up for it.  I had the Prime Bone in Ribeye.  This steak was delicately grilled at a super high temperature and served at the perfect medium rare as requested.  It was well seasoned and slightly charred on the outside.  It cut like butter and was just awesome.  Sweetie had the Ahi Tuna small plate which she said was wonderful.  Cream Spinach, ala carte on the side was done nicely and wasn't so rich that I felt bad eating it.    Finishing off the meal was a complimentary dessert sent over by their chef for the birthday (Classy touch) and, as recommended by Jim who said he wasn't afraid to tell his Mother that Flemings Carrot Cake was better than hers, a nice serving of Carrot Cake.  They put pineapple and golden raisins in their carrot cake which is a nice touch.  It was decadent.  Great night, great experience.  Flemings outdid themselves last night and it was appreciated.",

My husband said he's never eaten a steak that he was able to cut with a fork! Everything was absolutely delicious. Everyone who worked there was so nice and the service was outstanding. There is another high-end steakhouse restaurant in Charlotte that has now been replaced by Fleming's as our favorite.

The expectations were unfortunately overhyped.. My wife and I ordered the  filet, poached lobster, Diablo shrimp, Flemings salad, loaded potato, sprouts, Turtle pie, and started with calamari. The calamari was good - the loaded potato was the highlight of the meal.  They have a black Hawaiian sea salt that is great.  Shame we are talking about salt for a prime steakhouse.  The steak was ok - but not $60 ok.. had to be sent back as it was rare, as in purple color. Came back out fine but the overall taste was not as good as what I fix at home - and nowhere near Ruth Cris or Morton's..  The lobster was a little rubbery but not overly done. The diablo shrimp was a good addition - but 3 medium sized shrimp versus the \"colossal\" they claimed was disappointing.   They asked at check in who the Bday was going to be for and we advised. Not once was that ever acknowledged at the table.  Our friends were embarrassed at the meal after hyping this up for a month. I always hate that and have been head over heels for a place, only to be bad the time we take out friends.  Also - pass on the turtle pie. We took home to eat and ended up throwing in the trash. Just wasn't good. Our friends got the lava cake - that was solid!  Overall, the food is not bad.. it just wasn't good. And when you drop $500 for a table of 4... the food should be spectacular. Perhaps going during the busy time would make the food better - but based on last night, we won't be back. Too many better options out there to spend your money on..",

If this is a high-end steak place I would think they could come up with their own blend....it tasted a lot like a steak I could make at home and I can spot that stuff anywhere. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, but it's not something I'd expect at a fine dining establishment...a good steak doesn't need a ton of embellishment in my opinion.    If they don't use that seasoning in the restaurant I will definitely go back...but if they do I'd probably just opt for grilling out myself.",

    "text": "I'm not a Fleming's newbie.   I've visited their La Jolla, Woodland Hills, and Walnut Creek locations (all in California) numerous times and have always had a wonderful experience.   When I saw that there was a Fleming's right across from my hotel, I made sure to dine here at the first opportunity.  Being by myself, I opted to sit at the bar and started off with a Fleming's Classic Martini.   I sipped merrily on my cocktail while perusing their menu and honed in pretty quickly on the lamb chops and their Chipotle Mac & Cheese.  The food arrived actually right as I took my last sip of martini.   Having ordered a beautiful meal, I figured I'd accompany it with a nice glass of red wine and I ordered a glass of Hall Cabernet at 18 dollars  (I know, ouch!)   Here's where they lost that 5th star:  they brought me a carafe and poured me the glass of red wine but I never actually got to see the bottle of Hall.    Now that's not saying that they totally gave me some cheap red wine instead of what I ordered.   While my palate isn't so sophisticated I certainly am able to tell the difference between swill and more elegant vintages.   Nevertheless, if I'm going to venture out and blow almost 20 bucks for a *glass* of wine, show me the bottle, will ya?  The meal was lovely and the wine paired well with the lamb and Mac & Cheese.   I stuffed my face, royally and had a wonderful meal.   Most certainly I would come back in a heartbeat.    I actually had to laugh at some point when I looked down the bar and realized I was the only person there drinking wine.   Everybody had a glass of bourbon, or some martini or other, and that includes the few people that, like me, had opted to dine at the bar.     What's the dead giveaway that there's a Northern California in your restaurant, I chuckled to myself?   Look for the guy who's sitting at the bar, eating lamb chops and drinking a glass of red wine.    Classic!",

    "text": "BEST SERVER EVER!!!! We had Jesse F. as our server and he really added to the meal. We were in town for a bowl game and he stayed conscientious of both our time and the food for us. Cannot say enough about him...if you go here ask to be seated in his section as he really knows both the food and the area. He gave us great area recommendations and gave us a new tip of \"splitting salads\" when you order a few appetizers to go with your meal. It made so much sense when we did it and I can't thank him enough for keeping us from being too full before our steaks came out.   We started with the jumbo shrimp and beef carpaccio. Shrimp were a little longer and skinnier than what we are used to as Morton's regulars. All in all, they were pretty good though. The carpaccio was really good. Very flavorful and had a decent amount of capers. The sauce and bread on it was unique but added so much to the flavor. We split a wedge salad and that was good enough to end on.   However, we soldiered on and had a strip steak and a bone-in filet. The steaks were freakin' amazing. The strip was 14-16 oz. and full of flavor. I'd never had a bone-in filet before but this was a great steak. Both steaks were prepared perfectly to our specifications and the chef even came out to make sure the meal was going well. The sides of garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus were prefect and delicious.   We could not have asked for a better evening or meal and I really applaud Flemings on their strong service and high quality of food. We expected the meal to be expensive and it was but for a bottle of great wine and 2 steaks, 2 apps, 2 sides and a salad we weren't surprised by the total. If you aren't ready for the bank account commitment go to Texas Roadhouse. (Which has solid steaks too for the price...but you'll miss out on so much and Jesse!)",

    "text": "Ok, so my husband and I messed up. We bought tickets to see Jersey Boys for the Saturday night during the CIAA Tournament. We left our house really early and crawled up 7th, literally crawled, to the point where I had to call and inform the restaurant that we were going to be late for our reservation.  The man who answered the phone was very understanding and accommodating. We finally secured a parking spot and weaved our way in and out of the massive crowd, forward and finally into Flemings. There were some people waiting in the lobby area and I immediately feared we would be joining them since we were approx 10 mins late for our reservation. We checked in with a female hostess and the man, turned to us with a big smile and said, \"you weren't even that late,\" making us feel very welcome.   We were taken to our seats right away. We were initially seated at a table but asked to be moved to a booth since we were celebrating our anniversary. The super friendly hostess did so with no complaint and then asked how long we had been together (7 years!).   Shortly after being seated our waiter, Jesse, came over and asked if we were going to the show and verified what time it started to make sure that we would be finished with enough time to fight the crowds on the street to get to the show. He made some suggestions for appetizers and whatnot and then we placed our order. The ONLY way this meal fell short is because the appetizer arrived before our drinks. Normally this would not be acceptable but the bar was so busy and it wasn't as though the employees were standing around not working. Since it was only about a minute difference I decided to let it go and just enjoy the evening.   We started with the BBQ shrimp which were very tasty. The husband really enjoyed them as did I. I ordered the filet cobb salad with what they called a tarragon ranch, that just tasted like a regular ranch to me but it was still good. My only issue with this meal was that it seemed for the $27 price tag there should have been a bit more meat. In the end, however, it proved to be the right amount of food and I left feeling full but not overly stuffed.  The husband order the lite filet which came with a side of the Fleming's potatoes and a side of mac n cheese. He allowed me bites of each side and I have to say they were pretty delicious.   Jesse (the waiter) was really good with helping with a wine selection (a delicious Malbec at a totally reasonable price!) and seriously provided the best service we have had in a very long time. He was there when you needed him but not overbearing and just had a great personality. I found the service to be so top-notch that I even stopped the manager to compliment him, which is not something I normally do.   After the meal was completed and we went to pay we decided to sign up for their e-mail program and when he took the form to the hostess she informed it that it was our 7th anniversary and he brought us a small box of 4 truffle chocolates which was the perfect touch to end a perfect dinner on what originally looked like it was going to be a not so perfect night.   We will def be going back and asking for Jesse to be our server again!",

    "text": "I had dinner at Fleming's after work last night. I'm a regular there so this review will probably lean more towards the bigger picture than just one visit. I remember eating at a Fleming's in Nashville when I was in college. It was the first and only time I'd been to one before they opened in Charlotte and I remembered it being the best steakhouse meal I'd ever had. When I heard they were opening one here, I was stoked. Needless to say we started going there not long after they first opened (I think it was 2008 but don't hold me to that) and have been going regularly ever since. I've done the steakhouse circuit - Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, Sullivan's, Morton's - but Fleming's to me is just nicer than all of them. It's not as stuffy as Ruth's Chris or Morton's and the food is better. It's classier than Sullivan's, and, well, I just never really liked Capital Grille at all. Maybe I'm picky.  The ambiance at Fleming's is lovely. It's an easy place to relax. There have been times I didn't even realize the restaurant had gotten busy because I was happily nestled in my own booth, absorbed in the food and conversation. The lighting is dim, but not so dim you can't read the menu. Dark, rich wood adorns the booths and walls, giving the restaurant a sort of classic look. And the service? What can I say about the service? Our usual server is Azer and he is always so welcoming and seems genuinely happy to see us. He's attentive and spot-on with everything and every experience is relaxed and enjoyable. Tom and Jared, two of the managers, are equally welcoming and friendly, always stopping by to say hello and catch up. They make eating at Fleming's feel like visiting friends instead of just being an anonymous restaurant patron, which always makes me want to go back.  I've made my way around the menu from the delicious filets to the sea bass that is frequently a special, to the small plates (the short ribs are my favorite on that list) to the king crab legs. You really just can't go wrong with this menu. Last night I had the petite filet with the mushroom risotto and it was delightful. Sometimes I treat myself to the chocolate lava cake for dessert, which is one of the best things I've ever tasted. The combination of gooey chocolate cake and the liquidy hot fudge with vanilla ice cream is just to die for.  Their after-work happy hour bar menu is great, too. It's more casual, the star of which is a cheeseburger and fries. I've sat at the bar and had the burger on several occasions and it was delicious. Very juicy and slightly peppery for a little extra flavor. It's a fun bar atmosphere, too, if you're looking for a  place to chill after a long work day. Sometimes it's a nice, informal way to enjoy my favorite restaurant without doing the full dining room experience.   All in all, Fleming's is just a fantastic restaurant with great food, spot-on service and an enjoyable atmosphere. They've created such an enjoyable experience that I can only keep going back time and time again.",

    "text": "First, it's important to understand that this 2/5 rating is reflective of a fine dining establishment. It's still much, much better than the traditional steakhouses; but, compared to Ruth's Chris, Del Frisco's, Morton's, etc., this restaurant just doesn't stack up.   Perhaps it's because they were running their Queen's Feast promotion, but the cuts of filet were surprisingly thin and a touch overdone across the entire table (5 people). Honestly, it was shocking.  Everyone enjoyed the tie starter; the salads and lobster bisque were delicious. But, while tasting great, the lobster bisque lacked any lobster.  Finally, I had the carrot cake for dessert, which wasn't served for 10 minutes after our table was cleared. There's a difference between moist cakes and wet cakes, and this cake was wet, small, and doused in caramel.  With all the other places to go in Charlotte, I'd recommend skipping this and going somewhere else.",

I used to go to the Crabtree location (in Raleigh) for the 4-5-6 and 8-9-10 happy hours all the time, and had an absolute ball. So I decided to meet a girlfriend at this location for HH. Unfortunately, this location doesn't have nearly as good a selection of happy hour cocktails. There weren't any cocktail specials at all here!! I ordered the calamari- which was just okay- and the burger (which never disappoints). I can't say I'd be back because I only came for HH and without drink specials, the hour isn't all that happy to me lol. I know it's North Carolina and the laws are weird around HH drink specials, but they could work around that if they wanted to. Oh well. I'll just keep hunting for a perfect HH spot. Fleming's won't be it.",

But, I also do a ton of work entertainment and honestly they cook a perfect steak and the service is impeccable without being formal or stiff.  In the past I have even boycotted my local Flemings because of an assistant manager and his totally crappy attitude to the staff and customers. (He's no longer there)  I have been back twice recently and I'm back into the high on Flemings groove.  Admittedly they still have an over priced wine list so you have to know your wines to find the hidden gems.  The ambiance is one that envelops you (in every Flemings I have visited) if it hot out its cool and relaxing, if it's cold outside it's warm and comfy. Who could ask for more?  The menu is always great from starters through desert and the steaks are perfect!",

Had the sea bass special which was over risotto and topped with scallops and shrimp. Couldn't have been more tasty and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Wife had the steak (filet) which I did try and it also was delicious. Oh, we also had the housemade burrate and that was very good as well. No question it's pricey, I think the bill was $300+ after tip for two people, but worth it to us for a great meal experience.",

The calamari was delicious as always as well as the burrata salad. My grilled salmon was overcooked as I asked for it rare and it was over done. They re cooked it perfectly. The petite filet was delicious and perfectly flavored. The bone in rib eye was just ok as the flavor was good but a little tough. No one even asked why we barely touched it.  We ordered the lava cake early when we got our soup and after they cleared our final meal's it still took 40 minutes for the waiter to bring it. When we asked about it the waiter said they are plating it. We literally sat unattended or checked on for 30 minutes and we stood to get a bus boy to find our waiter. Our waiter Jesse  wasn't around much and certainly had no concern for our comments.   My husband asked for a mgr and waited for a few minutes but decided to just Yelp it as no one came out and our meal took over 2 1/2 hours.",

    "text": "When your offering has to compete with the most expensive restaurants in Charlotte, you have to do things to make yourselves stand out.  Wow customers with service, add some novel twist to your offering to make it special, provide incentives or some kind of special insider deal to make people feel like they're unique.... something.  We've eaten at Flemings a few times and every time I had been there, except for the most recent visit, I concluded pretty much the same thing.  The service is exceptional.  Every time.  The food is good.  Exceptional?  no... but you're going to get good food.  And the atmosphere was a great place to let loose and feel a bit swanky and modern at the same time.  This time all of it came crumbling down however.  The service was average, the food remained good, but the atmosphere was drab and appeared to be struggling a bit for a Friday evening.    Our waiter just generally seemed uninterested.  Yes, we had the scoop from an online sign-up for a $50/person lobster and filet deal.  So I can see why a server would phone it in a bit, they must assume we're cheapskates who are just trying to get a deal and won't tip according to full menu prices.  But after we ordered a couple rounds, a bottle of wine, additional appetizers, etc... he should have picked up on the potential.  He was aloof, didn't give us full attention even when we asked him questions... just really sort of... Chevy when we expect Cadillac  Anyway you dice it, we were disappointed with what we had thought up until that experience, was the crowning value Flemings brought to the table, exceptional service.  Without one of these three pillars (food, service, atmosphere) being better than their competitors, I struggle to justify dropping the time and cash to choose Fleming's over the dozen other options out there.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a date night at Fleming's last night and loved the food! We are steak people. We love a good filet that's a quality cut of meat and cooked right. Fleming's had an excellent cut of filet and it was cooked exactly how we asked on the first try. It had a great buttery flavor and was very tender. The mashed potatoes were delicious! The Brussels sprouts have the potential to be excellent, but they went too heavy on the oil and vinegar last night. The wedge salad was delicious as well. The blue cheese was perfectly creamy and the salad tasted fresh. Our server was very attentive, our glasses were never empty, and the restaurant was quiet. It was a slow night, which we didn't mind at all. So the only cons were the brussel sprouts weren't what I was hoping for, and I didn't actually like the bread that was served. I love bread, but their bread wasn't my favorite. Even with those two minor things in mind, we will definitely return! Obviously, it is priced a little higher than other steak houses, so if paying a lot of money for a good steak isn't your thing, Outback is a great option. You do also have to pay to park, but that's just city living for you! I highly recommend Fleming's!",

As total food snob from San Francisco, there are very few memorable meals in Charlotte.  Flemings was a total surprise and made me thing otherwise.  The porcini mushroom ravioli appetizer with a salad was a great light dinner one night - paired with a yummy Spanish white wine.  The 2nd meal was on a very crowded night and we were a group of 10.  For someone who rarely eats beef I went all out and orderd the NY Strip steak.  It was really good.  Our waiter gave us a thorough analysis of all the types of steaks and recommendations on how to have them prepared for the best flavor - very helfpul.  I will go back to Flemings my next trip for sure.  I can't say the same for the other restuarants I have tried in Charlotte.",

As we were originally going to grab a beer here and then go elsewhere for food, our group of 5 decided that we might as well stay here to eat instead.  I inquired with the hostess about sitting at a table in the dining room and ordering from the bar entree menu, and she assured me that the menu was available regardless of where we sat.  Once at our table, I asked the waiter if our table could see a bar food menu, and he stated that the menu was only available at the bar.  I explained our confusion, and he rightly deferred to the floor manager, who in turn deferred to the general manager.  I suppose this man was either just cranky or tired of people asking for the bar menu, because when I explained the miscommunication, he snapped and tried to kick us out of the restaurant.  I understand restaurant policy, but when a member of the staff is at fault, generally the manager will politely compromise or attempt to smooth things over.  Instead, we were publicly shamed for his employee's mistake.  We stood our ground, stating that we could have just remained at the bar (which was now full), and he stormed off to grab bar menus, which he slammed down onto the table.  Disgusted, we decided to just tip the waiter for his time and leave.  We were clearly willing to spend money on drinks and food, but Fleming's was too proud to let us.  Terrible.",

I don't mind paying for an expensive dinner but I sure don't want to feel like I've paid $150 to eat in an Applebee's or  a bar, and that's the atmosphere created by the loud pop music.",

First thoughts, the decor and atmosphere was definitely that of clean, modern steakhouse with dim lighting and dark colors with wooden accents.  It kind of reminded me of Dylan Prime back in NYC.  I made my way to the bar and ordered the seared ahi tuna and the burger ($6 each).    Both were cooked appropriately, a lot of red!  The burger was good but the tuna, woooooweeee!  I could have eaten a bunch of it.    The service was good and the bartender was helpful in providing directions for local nightlife aside from epicentre.  Would definitely go back and recommend to another.  Oh, they seemed to have a solid wine list that rotates seasonally as any respected somelier would do.",

I'm not fond of the top charing), instead it is a nice crispy dark brown. The steak was perfectly cooked for me. I'm a rare person and it had just enough cold in the middle to make me happy.  I also liked their take on the classic potatoes gratain. The Chedder and Jalapeno was a welcome change from the normal gruyere and nutmeg flavor.",

    "text": "4.5?  OK. I am always looking for a bargain so when I saw gift cards at Costco ($80 for 2-$50 gift cards), I decided to try this place.   The decor of this upscale restaurant was very warm and comfortable and unpretentious (so I was told by my sister who says she felt out of place at the Capital Grille in Charlotte). We came on a Tuesday evening before New Years so the place seemed very empty. The free valet was great (especially when it cost $10 to park in the near garage). My husband ordered a martini which he claimed to be the best he had in memory (and I know he is picky because years ago I served him a martini that he sent back). We complimented the bartender and she asked us to stop by the bar for an after dinner drink.   For dinner, we ordered the cold seafood tower for two as an appetizer. This is the one reason why I did not give this place a 5-star. Although the presentation was beautiful, for $50 it was a bit of a rip-off. The crab legs, claws, lobster and shrimp were flavorless. I realize that it is difficult to get fresh seafood so far away from the coast, but for such a nice restaurant, they could have done better or taken it off the menu.   The menu was simple and the wine list long. We ordered the lamb chops, bone-in ribeye and bone-in NY strip. When we got our plates, we were amazed at how large the pieces of meat were. The lamb and steaks were cooked perfectly medium-rare. This is the best steak that I can remember--and I eat steaks very often. The meat was tender, seasoned perfectly, and had a nice crust on them. We also ordered the sauteed mushrooms, which were fine--nothing more to say about it. And then the onion rings...... Oh the onions rings, were so delicious--I have a weakness for all things fried. The rings were cut rather large (3/4\" or so) so the onion still had good texture and the breading was crisp and light. It was an excellent balance of onion and breading.   Over-stuffed, we were unable to eat desserts so we headed to the bar to see the bartender. Although the dinning room was rather empty, the bar was packed and very lively. To our surprise, the bartender really hooked us up with our drinks.   Overall, not cheap, not fancy, but a great dining experience. I can't wait for them to open in the Domain in Austin, TX.",

The ambience was amazing, the service was beyond amazing, the food was PHENOMENAL...We had the crab cakes for our appetizer and OMG if they weren't the best crab cakes we've ever eaten. I had the filet & my husband had the ribeye, which I wasx jealous of because the ribeye had the most amazing flavor we have ever tasted. My filet was delicious, but I still prefer Ruth Chris's filet over any filet I'v ever had, but it was still amazing. I did enjoy their signature scalloped potatoes. I do admit I was nervous to try them b/c I don't like spicy foods and this potato has japaleno's, but you would never know it. Our server was the best and overall I rate this Steakhouse in my Top 2. If you have the budget, you absolutely HAVE to come to Flemings...You will not be disappointed!",

The waiter tried to push on us a bottle of wine and seemed disappointed that we elected to buy wine by glass. After an appetizer I was looking forward to a piece of warm bread with butter but received none (on occasion you might need to wait for a fresh batch of bread but I looked around and other tables had it, overall not a busy dining room). I finally asked for some bread and the water waiter brought it to our table - no plates (which were taken away after appetizer). I had no place to put the bread on. Our waiter showed up and instead of correcting the problem asked if we wanted another round of wine - I told him I would like bread plates. By the time we got the plates the food was here so I gave up on the bread but at this point was irritated that I needed to keep asking to be attended. My steak was tasty but rather salty. My husband's sea bass was OK. We did not bother with desserts - I did not want to stay longer. Unfortunately, not a great experience overall - on account of our anniversary the restaurant did give us a small box of truffles to go - nice touch but a bit too late. Will not go there again - should have gone to The Capital Grill (remains my favorite steak house in town).",

Upon arriving 15 min early we were greeted with the Host and she told us that our table will be available at 8:30pm which is the time of our reservation. It was totally fine for us to wait since we are early but when 8:30pm arrived she did not acknowledge us or even just tell us that they still haven't reserve our table which made us upset. Then, after maybe 20 more minutes we were finally seated and she finally apologized for the wait which makes us feel better. Thankful for our server Scott, he was amazing and very attentive. He always checked up on us. He also told us that since we had to wait for so long that we could choose either a free appetizer or free dessert. We then ordered our meal and we ordered both of our steaks medium rare. After we got our food and began eating we noticed the steaks were more like medium well to well done. But we were so hungry that we ate them without complaint. Luckily, The Manager Jaime Schutz checked on us and apologized for the wait and she also noticed that our steaks were not cook to our order. She asked us if we both wanted another steak but we declined since we were already half way through eating them. So she offered to pay for our meal which was awesome! We also got the dessert, cheesecake, and it was great. So overall we are very pleased with our waiter and the manager. The only reason this isn't a five star is because of the initial wait and our food not being correct initially. We will definitely go back.",

Their management team let me come in to coordinate and decorate hours before my reservations which said a lot due to past experiences. They also assisted to make sure my party had a great dinner experience. Food was exquisite and meat was freshly cooked to high standards. Definitely recommend for a date night/ dinner party cause the setting really sets the mood for either occasion. Thanks to Aaron and his team for the great experience!",

    "text": "KThe ambience allowed is the only downside, but it's a pretty big one. Charlotte hosts many travelers, domestic and international, because of its popularity for being a banking business hub. This means Fleming's would do well to make sure their clientele is aware of and respecting this fact.  The entire time having my solo meal at the bar (i do this a lot as a consultant and out of respect to the waiters in the dining room who are hoping for at least two diners), I felt like I was in an Irish pub NOT un upscale restaurant/bar. The three people sitting next to me should've been cut off or asked to quiet down, not allowed to yell obscenities or things like \"titty bar!\" Or \"he got the black AND Hispanic fever!\" The food is great, the wine selection is great but ambience overpowered it all. For that, the experience is a 3- star.  UPDATE: I told the bartender and manager and they responded admirably. I do not seek and actively reject comps, but allowed them to get me a glass of wine on the house. I was invited back, to show that they will take measures to correct this issue. I'm not back for 6 months and I'm looking forward to the visit.",

She helped me every step of the way with options and solutions for my wife's 40th Birthday. We ended up with a party of 18 people and the service couldn't have been any better. I did not get the manager's name but he was extremely nice and showed everyone to the table and made sure everything was to our liking. \"Mo\" was our server (wish I could remember his full name) he was on top of it! He seemlesly took everyone's drink order. Waiting for drink or food wasn't even anywhere near an issue. We all had or drink within minutes. Mo's recommendations for wine were excellent. He took our food orders... I have never been anywhere that could even come close to matching the speed and quiality of this meal. The kitchen staff (who did an outstanding job) had everyone's meal cooked to perfection and ready all at the same time. Absolutely amazing. To be totally honest (because all reviews should be) only one hiccup, my cousin got a chopped salad instead of a wedge salad chopped, this extremely minor mixup was remedied by Mo in less than one minute. Our entire evening at Fleming's in Charlotte was outstanding. This will not be our last time nor will it be our last event there. THANK YOU everyone from the staff, kitchen, Mo, Megan, Management, and corporate for providing the baseline of how all restaurant experiences should be. I can't thank you enough for making my wife's 40th birthday dinner an amazing event. We highly recommend Fleming's Steak House in Charlotte NC.",

Although I've eaten at a Fleming's before I was more interested in their cocktails this night. Will definitely be back to try their food.  Another football fanatic and myself ordered the Bourbon Basil Bash which we thought would be pretty strong with a nice herbal taste which I got that but felt it was to sweet. This would be a great summer drink for brown drinkers.  With the Basil bash being more on the sweet side and we wanted something a bit stronger, we ordered a Makers in the ice which you can never go wrong with that.  Since this was a private party, we had one server which I felt there should have been 2 due to the number of guests. Our server was in assuming o overwhelmed since it literally took almost 15-20 mins to get our second drink. The waiter was extremely nice, apologetic and welcoming. He recommended drinks and also pre-planned meals from the birthday menu. Would have had more drinks if the drinks came out quicker.  Overall a great experience & the birthday boy had a great time. Will be back to try the steak and another Basil Bash with less sweet and more basil",

While you can not go wrong eating at any of these places, I think that when it comes to service I would give the edge to Flemings.  We were three couples and after dinner one of the women could not decide between two after dinner drinks. With out a word our server brought both to the table, at no charge, so she and the rest of the table could taste them both. The pork chop was excellent and I enjoyed the creamed spinach and onion rings; the others liked the mushrooms. Wine was standard steak house selection and prices, no complaints. They do a nice pour for their cocktails. If I was nit  picking I would say that I do not like paying $15 for valet parking when eating at that level of an establishment; just charge me more and frank the parking. Flemings is an enjoyable dinning out night. Check out their frequent customer type card.",

Although we weren't fully aware of the steep prices until we looked at the menu, we were pleasantly surprised with the entrees and sides that we ordered.  I ordered the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass entree and it was SUPERB! I ate every single big of it. It was full of flavor and the miso glaze really put everything together. I would definitely order it again without a doubt. We also ordered the asparagus and chipotle cheddar macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese dish was delicious.  Overall our experience was great, but I couldn't give it a full five stars because of the steep prices. This is definitely a place to go for an intimate celebration (anniversary, birthday, etc.) or a special occasion rather than a regular Saturday night meal.",

I ordered the surf and turf from Rigo's Special menu which was a filet and salmon over a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens. My steak melted in my mouth. I love steak and have gotten steak from several fine dining establishments but this was one of the best steaks I've ever had. I cannot wait to go back to try the orange miso glazed sea bass.

He made me leave ina very abusive manner and made me feel like a douche. I paid my $95 tab at the bar and left $100 in cash for the bartenders who did a great job as hosts. Other than William Edwards who actually called the police on me, it was a great experience. The police laughed at his insane behavior and I bid them goodnight. I normally give 5 stars. Based on William Edwards, I can not. Don't go here to have a good time. In New Orleans he would be run off on a freight train.

This would have been the case with all things, here in Charlotte, except for one thing:  The steak!  I am a filet eater simply because I have no tolerance for fat or gristle yet my petit filet was riddled with it. Every other bite was a gaggy effort to get this thing chewed enough to swallow it. Bleck!  Honestly, I have had better steaks at low-end steak places at a third the cost.   I had a delicious chopped salad and the onion rings, which were also very good. Ice cream was desert along with a $16 Cabernet which was decent. My tab exceeded $100 which is a price point that I expect something more than gaggy gristle.   It will be some time before I return to Fleming's, anywhere.",

We got there early and had a great drink at the bar, I always order a French Martini just to test the bartender's skill set and I was not disappointed what so ever.   Our waiter, Azer Cokljat gave us great suggestions for pairings and we ended up splurging on a bottle, per his recommendation. The wine was fabulous. We both had the filet a la oscar and it also could not have been better. Crab meat can be hit or miss and they had delicious lump crab and it was fresh and you could tell a wonderful quality.   Their sides are also wonderful. We chose to have the creamed spinach and the Fleming's potatoes. I am a huge lover of jalapenos and the potatoes were fantastic. Dessert was also very good but I didn't get to eat too much after stuffing my face with all the amazing food that came beforehand.   We will 100% be returning and asking for Azer Cokljat as our waiter. Thank you for a lovely date night.",

There weren't any tables available so we went back to the hostesses and asked how long it would be for a table in the dining room. We were told 15-20 minutes.

The bar area is a little small for my liking with the bar booth right up to the bar. If it's a slow night, not a big deal, but if the bar is 2-3 deep, eating in the bar area may be a little cramped.   Hit this up on a recent restaurant week, and it was good, but I wasn't overwhelmed. I'd make the excuse of restaurant week, but some restaurants really step it up and make sure their customers leave wanting come back for more and spend the $$$. Flemings didn't do that for me, though I will be back to try the full menu. Loved the bread and spread choices! Steak was cooked through nice for me, but was over seasoned, which made my water go away fast. Jalapeno potatoes were good and went bye-bye fast. Enjoyed the cheesecake for dessert, though the 2nd one we had...mousse, was so-so.",

The service is very good, food is higher chain steakhouse and acceptable, but after being denied the courtesy of a parking validation only because we had eaten in the bar area (approximately $100 for 2 people), I got a bad taste in my mouth.  The management has informed me politely that regardless of the check, as we went for happy hour (which is every day including Sundays from 5 to 7), they could not offer the validation. Their happy hour is indeed a great deal, so I can see the reasoning there. I would like to see them base that off of amount spent instead though.   Review updated, thanks David for the explanation.",

    "text": "So I've waited about 20 or so days before writing a review hoping to maybe see my wife's perspective as she loved the place. I share some of her enthusiasm but on an overall scale I have to move down to \"it's ok\". I ordered my usual ribeye, creamed spinach, proceeded by french onion soup. Soup was good, hot, and flavorful. Not perfect but definitely good. My wife ordered the Flemings Potatoes the house specialty with cream, jalapenos and cheddar cheese. These arrived au gratin fashion. The jalapenos flavor was almost nonexistent with little to no taste. I had expected it to be bold flavor. The potatoes were a bit undercooked also. The spinach was creamy and had good flavor and the only drawback to it was the size of the portion. Portion is barely enough for two people. Steaks came in a timely fashion but when they set mine down it just didn't look great. It is said that you eat with your eyes first so when it starts off with a tad disappointment it probably affects the rest of the experience. If your first impression is \"wow; that looks good\" this will usually carry you through some of your idiosyncrasies you walk through the front door with. They came up short in quelling those with the steak they set in front of me. My wife had the filet. It looked good but it's a filet and it stands on its own in my experience. You can buy choice grade cut from your local grocery store butcher and it will still look good even after you've flipped it way to many times on your grill!  I've read about the service being an issue in other reviews and I believe it is a result of a \"Let them Enjoy\" service policy. What ends up happening instead of your waiter passing by your table while giving it the once over to see if anything is needed without being intrusive, he ends up hanging out with the other servers shooting the breeze. My empty water went unnoticed and I had to dip into my reserve which I retrieved from my wife's glass while she looked away when suddenly prompted by a phantom \"you see that\" look in the opposite direction! I'm not a fan of the hovering server touching something on your table every three seconds, I remember when I was a kid some long time ago, my dad took us to a restaurant in Kittery Maine called the Whistling Oyster, they had what I recall seemed like 17 servers and every time you put down your roll it was replaced with a new hot one and your glass wasn't allowed to be drunk out of without being refilled. I remember simply picking up the glass and holding it to my mouth to see if the dude was actually going to put water in a full glass. So nuisance service no, but you would like some basic professionalism and not have to suck on your ice at 200+- a dinner! The absoute highlight of the night was the floor manager who brought out our valet ticket and our car was ready when we went out the door. Kudos to him! I'll go back because my wife likes it but not before I offer up the alternatives.  #",

My wife is a Vegetarian and there were no choices for her at all. We sort of expected this so it's not factored into the rating.  The wine selection is quite good. Lots of wine by the glass too which is cool because you don't have to commit to an extremely over priced bottle.  The sides were over cooked and drowned in butter.  On a whole - this place was OK. My opinion is that Ruth's Chris is a little bit better. I guess I may be picky but I still prefer my back yard and a bottle of wine over the False sense of entitlement that fills the air of these restaurants.",

    "text": "Disappointed after good reviews.  Walked in without a reservation, hosts told me 30 minutes for a table  (with a half full restaurant).  I went to the bar, then came back and asked about the half full restaurant...they still said 30 minutes (with that super stiff smile thing going on, you know the smile that's not a smile?).  I sat at the bar...and ten minutes later was seated at one of the empty tables in the half empty restaurant.  Server Jared was A+, excellent.  Unfortunately the wine I wanted was out.  Ordered the sliced mignon, which was VERY good but the risotto cakes were mushy and luke warm, as if just scooped from a lingering bowl.  I had the \"new school\" or some such caesar salad - um....limp and nothing too original, hardly generous with the prosciutto, which was the exciting addition.  The bread was excellent, as were the dips that came with it.  I asked for steamed spinach which came with onions (not explained on the menu) and server immediately took it back after he learned that I was allergic to onions.  $61, not feeling so good about that.   For the money, I'm headed to BLT Prime next time, at least I know what I'm getting there.  Maybe it was because it wasn't a buzzing night, but this place just seemed to be coasting.",

Large salads, full portions of their wonderful prime rib, sides and fantastic desserts all for $34.95 per person.  Come on, I'm not sure you could buy all the ingredients and make this meal yourself for that. The wedge salad was cold and crisp with lots of bacon and huge chunks of bleu cheese. The Prime rib was very tender and flavorful. I ordered mine rare and it came medium rare, but I didn't complain and it was still good. Sides of sauteed green beans and Flemings potatoes were huge and very tasty. We each had our fill of the sides and there was plenty left over. The dessert menu, while uninspired, contains all the classics and they are all made in-house and done extremely well. Free parking is the icing on the cake. Next time I'm in the mood for red meat and classic sides and desserts...I'm flying to Flemings.",

Great food... salad was superb, steak (flawless filet), flavorful sides (Fleming's potatoes) and vegetable sides were also perfect (spinach). Fleming's is a superb choice--maybe the best steakhouse in Charlotte!  Great for work dinner, couples or friends. Great wine list, great decor. My only minor complaint is that this location seems to let the host stand go empty sometimes--had to a wait a few minute to be seated. Other locations have 2-3 staff at host stand all the time. Manager should fix this here. Otherwise, A+.",

He described the specials to us and we decided to branch out from our normal filet to the shared tomahawk for two.  This came with 3 sauces, the marscapone was my favorite-just outstanding.  THe owner/manager (Tom) came out to present it and sliced/served it for us.  It was just an outstanding flavor to the steak.  They even wrapped up the bone for us to take home to our dog.  To start off they even split the wedge salad for us as they mentioned it was a nice portion and good to share.  To top it off they heard us discussing we were getting married soon and surprised us with a treat.  The food was just delicious and the service was outstanding.  The chocolate truffles they sent us home with were absolutely delicious.  We are big wine/chocolate people and order special chocolate, but this was some of the best we've had.  There are many great steakhouses in Charlotte, but Fleming ranks at the top.  This great service really puts it above the others.",

I would first start off saying the atmosphere was very nice. The waiter was great gave great service and was over the top in helpfulness. What I mean he went the extra mile. The only True complaint is the price for what you get. She had the filet mignon which was under cooked that she couldn't finish it not that there was much to eat anyways. I had the Peppercorn Steak which was just ok. I just feel that with all the side items which you purchase seperately that the main course item would be larger. I felt we both walked away hungry. Would I go back probably not as I rather try somewhere else next time.",

    "text": "The hubby and I chose to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of our first date at Flemings.  We initially chose the location because we had a Dine Rewards incentive available and we thought we'd try something new with that reward.  This was our first experience dining at Fleming's.  I loved that they had our table decorated with gold confetti and an Anniversary Card.  Our waiters, Jose and Larry, were personable, friendly, and in general, just awesome!  We started the night with a couple of cocktails.  The hubby had the Old Fashioned ($14) which featured \"Basil Hayden bourbon, aromas of orange peel, layered with sweet toasted vanilla\".  I decided to try a bourbon cocktail that I had never experienced before--you know, to extend the bourbon palate. I'm always excited to find new ways to incorporate bourbon.  So I ordered the Royale Pal ($14) which featured \"Templeton Rye, Dolin Blanc & Aperol with a hint of strawberry\".  The Old Fashioned was absolutely perfect and balanced between the bourbon, citrus, and vanilla.  I didn't hate my Royale Pal, but it definitely underwhelmed me.  The bourbon just didn't stand out against the other flavors, which I found odd given that the cocktail utilized a Rye-based bourbon.  To make up for it, we ordered a second round later, both of which were Old Fashioned's!  For our dinner, we elected to indulge in the Tomahawk Tuesday special ($120) which included two salads, two sides and a Tomahawk steak to share, and two desserts.  I chose the Caesar and the hubby chose the Wedge.  Both were generously portioned and quite delicious.  My Caesar was created with coarsely chopped lettuce and parmesan, which I'll be honest, I didn't prefer.  My preference for this style of salad is that the lettuce to be chopped into smaller bite-size pieces, and I find that parmesan flavor blooms better in this salad when it is grated instead of shaven, but I realize that's just my personal preference.  My dressing was well-balanced for a classic Caesar and I could detect the subtle hint of anchovy, which I always expect in a good Caesar dressing. For our sides, we chose the Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Bacon and the North Atlantic Lobster Macaroni & Cheese.  Can I just insert in here that I have a love/hate relationship with knowing the calories in my food?  I would never have guessed that the Mac & Cheese had 1710 calories had it not been on the menu.  It was a special occasion and sounded freaking amazing so we ordered it anyway.  Seeing that number calories on the menu did not spark joy for me, but let me tell you the flavor of that mac & cheese absolutely did!!!  Worth. Every. Darn. Calorie.  It was creamy with a lightly smoked flavor but it also a tiny bit tangy at the back of the palate. It was heavenly.... what more can I say?  If you dine here, order it.  You won't regret it.  Moving on... for dessert we had the Molten Lava Cake and Creme Brulee.  We didn't need to see the menu to choose desserts, so I didn't have to look at the calories (TG!).  Jose delighted us by lighting some Grand Marnier and pouring it over the Lava Cake tableside.  You really can't go wrong with chocolate cake or creme brulee, but I thought the presentation of both desserts was outstanding.  Overall, Flemings earned a solid 5 stars and I won't hesitate to come here again the next time we are celebrating a milestone!!",

However, my wife and I wanted to try a restaurant we haven't been to for restaurant week. It was a great experience! We had an amazing waiter (Jessie). He asked us if we had any food allergies (a few times) which I have never had before. He didn't rush us which I feel normally happens during restaurant week. We were able to really enjoy our meal and our bottle of wine which Jessie helped us pick. We were deciding between a few bottles and suggested a different one which we ended up getting as my wife preferred that one.   The food was perfect. We had the soup, steak and cheesecake for dessert. Both of our steaks were cooked as we asked. the one down side was the amount of blueberry sauce I had on my cheesecake. My wife joked about it to Jessie and he brought me more. It was a very nice of him.   I believe we will come back the next time we are looking for a steak dinner. Thank you for making our first time memorable.",

We were just trying to find somewhere close to our hotel with good yelp ratings to eat because we were starving but we also like to eat well.  We walked in and I waited for another gentleman to finish his request for a table. I told the young man at the podium that there were 5 of us and he said it would just be a couple minutes for a table (we could see empty tables). He and another young lady seated some people with reservations and he came back to the podium and looked at us again (we were the only ones there). He got on the phone, spoke quietly and then told us that never mind, they didn't have any tables for at least 20-30 minutes.   We were pretty offended because we felt like there was some judgement going on (kids? Underdressed?) I'm not sure but It seemed shady and we were all getting hangry.   Lucky for us, we walked across the street to a place with a better health rating and food that my family are all happy with.",

I can't recommend our server Amanda tonight. She's not horrible was just a bit off putting for me. And she swore I didn't tell her to apply the dine rewards nor can she see it.   I'm like (1) every other sister restaurant can see it as they offer it and (2) maybe if she wasn't quick to run off she would have heard me clearly state I have 2 promos please use 1 and here's my number. Why else would I write my number on the check?!?!?  Happy hour is still decent since it is offered on weekends as well.   Steak + Lobster is still $50 until mid April.   Steak + King Crab is $59 until May 1st.   $20 gift card bonus promo until May something. Bonus card eligible for use May 14th on.   Worth going if you're walking. On the train.

I feel like the quality is good and much better than anything you are going to get in the store but the prices are steep for comparable steakhouses.   I would rather go to Del Frisco or Sullivan's before going back to Flemings. The season or flavor of the steak was simply okay comparable to a more rich texture of Del Frisco. I always order my steaks medium rare and I love the taste because it is the most flavorful at that point to me.  As I got the lobster and steak special they run and it was decent.   I don't remember leaving here thinking oh I am dying to go back but I didn't leave there unsatisfied.  I am in no rush to come back here but I would recommend a try.   You may have a different experience but I can't complain. I just wanted great and got good.",

I'd recommend the Price Dry-Aged Ribeye (cooked medium), Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese, and the Crispy Brussels Spouts & Bacon... the sides are sharable for the table (just as they are for most of your $$$+ restaurants like The Capital Grille for example).   Our first visit to Fleming's was in January 2018 for my birthday, which is during Restaurant Week. We were so impressed that we went back for Valentines Day AND on our engagement day! Yes, my fiance proposed to me at Fleming's and the Fleming's staff helped make my engagement the best engagement ever! My fiance worked with the manager who helped make everything possible. They worked with him with all of the details even allowed the flowers to be delivered there and they stored them properly for us.   As soon as my fiance proposed Flemings gave us complimentary chocolate, wine, cheesecake, took our picture, developed it, and put it in a frame. My fiance then had a horse and carriage ride planned and the staff a Fleming's held on to our personal items and our leftovers for us.  They were sooo accommodating, I am forever grateful! We are literally heading to Fleming's tonight for our Anniversary! Fleming's will forever be a place that we celebrate special occasions.",

There wasn't room in a booth for them in the bar, so they were seated at a round table near us. Their language was extremely offensive and I can't imagine the the manager on staff or manager at all of Fleming's would approve of this type if customer in their restaurant.   During the course of the evening we witnessed a family with two small children across from (thankfully they had left) and a marriage proposal. It was a wonderful evening - until these drunk men walked through the door. They ruined a perfectly wonderful atmosphere.",

This has become my favorite Steakhouse in the area. I return here every year for my birthday, and my husband and I recently decided we cannot wait an entire year before returning. Our server, Shelby, was great. I was surprised to learn that she had only been serving by herself for a week. Very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I had the 16oz Ribeye, with the Porcini Mushroom rub, cooked medium rare. It was PHENOMINAL! My husband had the filet with the rub that was equivalent to a Heinz 57. His was just as good. We had the creamed spinach and chipotle mac and cheese for our sides...I have never had such a creamy mac and cheese full of flavor. We ended the night with the Chocolate Lava Cake, as it was my birthday and there are few things I love more than chocolate. I also found my new favorite wine while dining it is a Chardonnay called, Complicated. My overall experience was amazing. Great service, the manager even realized that a private party being held near us was rather loud and offered to move us if we would like, but we were fine. I would suggest this steakhouse a MILLION times over!",

During the meal, I wound up with another server who was OK.  I had salmon with blue cheese mashed potatoes.  Both were excellent.  As others have commented, the dining room is noisy...very noisy.  If I am going to pay near stratospheric prices for food, I want the ambiance to go with it.  This is where Fleming's is lacking IMHO.  There are too many other restaurants in Uptown Charlotte where you can get good food, good service, good ambiance and a dark beer.  I probably would not go back.",

As a side note, I recently dined at Morton's, also uptown, and Fleming's is so much better that I was surprised.    The clientele is not as upscale as I remember, but that is probably what I get for going to EpiCenter on a Saturday night.  We actually witnessed a couple leave the restaurant yelling-- at employees or diners, I am not sure, but it was pretty surprising and not pleasant.",

    "text": "This meal could easily qualify as my Last Supper!   Despite the crowded CIAA weekend, the customer service was excellent! The wait staff was prompt, attentive, and kind. If you are a fan of Ruth Chris and you enjoy steak, chicken, and chops this is a great place that serves above average food!   I had a blueberry martini done with grey goose and fresh blueberry juice with blueberries at the bottom. A very sweet martini with a clean taste (thanks to the goose). For my entree I ordered the herb roasted chicken, tender and juicy with al la carte sides. The Sauteed Spinach (with a little bit of chipped purple onion) was perfect. It was refreshing to taste a vegetable that does not depend on butter for taste! Macaroni n cheese with leeks. I love a good creamy sharp cheddar cheese sauce!   My only complaint was that the a la cart sides were not as big as most other places I've been. No fault to Flemings, I'm just being greedy. But really, the sides are enough for one hungry person, so order two mac n cheese if that is your dish!    I am also pleased to know that I do not have to wait to go back to CIAA next year for a tasty rematch, there's a Flemings located in Tyson's Corner and in Baltimore. Hallelujah!!!",

    "text": "I give it 5-stars because I do think it tops BLT, which is right down the street. Also because I had the best appetizer of my life at this restaurant: the Lump Crab Louie Wrap. I would HIGHLY recommend it, and even considered going to the restaurant just to pick up that appetizer to go before. Yes, it is that good.  During the week days you'll see a really nice business crowd. It's got standard steaks and for those with some extra cash, the seafood platter is a good appetizer to get - really great seafood and some of the best lobster I've had.   I can only give this place 5-stars for how impressed I was with the seafood, especially being one who grew up on the east coast.",

    "text": "Not what I expected at all.  There are three great parts to my experience at Fleming's; the service, the atmosphere, and the drinks.  We came here for  restaurant week for a group of 4. Now I understand restaurant week you try to dumb the menu, which I knew before hand.  I ordered an uptown Manhattan which was probably one of the best drinks I have had in the area. Our server was quick, attentive, and even helped snag an extra chair for a guest we didn't know that was coming.  The ambience is dimly light (fake candles though) and very romantic/modern.  The bar area even looked nice to grab a few drinks.    So next we get our food orders.  We started with an appetizer of sweet chile calamari which I was overall impressed with.  Crispy, chewy, and the sweet chile taste was great and not overbearing.  The salad came next and nothing to thrilling, just a bag of lettuce dropped on my plate.  I didn't care about that I was waiting for the steak.  So while ordering my steak I asked for it to be cooked medium and inquired about what side there would be.  There was no side, but I could upgrade to a side of asparagus for $10. Really?  $10 for a couple pieces of asparagus.  So we decided to order sides \"family style\" which just meant a normal sized side where everyone got a teaspoon worth. Whatever, I didn't care bring on the STEAK!  So here it comes magically floating in my waiter's hand only to be magically going into my box at the end of the night.  I ended up donating this box to a homeless person ( duck voice guy).  The steak was the equivalent of what you would receive at a wedding, It was brown in the middle and cooked more to the tune of medium-well.  The taste just wasn't there.  Finally, they topped it off a tiny square of cheesecake which I would have preferred a small slice compared to this tiny portion.  I totally expected more from a place like this.  I understand it is restaurant week, but this did not do anything to win me over.  I actually would have been happy if just the steak was good, but daaaaaaaaaaaamn comes to my mind when thinking about it.  $85 for a terrible steak, an appetizer, and two manhattans.  I am pretty sure I could have went to another steakhouse such as Sullivan's and  spent the same price while receiving a Grade A steak.  Unfortunately I won't go back here for client meetings or dates.  I wonder if the homeless guy even chucked my steak in the trash.",

Clientele at that time seemed to be mostly bankers (lots of ties), but the ambiance was nice and us revelers didn't seem to be bothering the working people with our fun.   The decor is nice and the service was attentive. All were pleased with their order, and at our table we had the salmon, New York strip, Filet Mignon and scallops. The calamari appetizer is amazing and the chocolate lava cake dessert is the best I've had in town (you'll want to order early if you're on a time crunch - takes 18 minutes to prepare). The jalapeno mashed potatoes were really good as well. Be sure to arrive hungry as the portions are large and you're going to want both an appetizer and a dessert.   The restaurant validates your parking, which seems to be rare at the Epicentre. There is also a full bar if you don't feel like eating and a great specialty drink menu for those who'd like to try something new. Can get a bit pricy with drinks, appetizer, meal, and dessert, but overall, for a chain, I was pleased with the experience.",

It was freezing out there and most ladies put their coats or wraps back on.  One other table insisted on being moved it was so cold.  Though many people seated elsewhere complained and were visibly cold nothing was done about the temperature, we all shivered through dinner.  Drinks were good, husband had a wonderful Whisky Sour,  my Blueberry Drop was a little overly sweet but good.  Husband and I had the special NYE menu, filet was bland lobster was OK.  Our son had a wonderfully cooked New York Strip which we all wished we had ordered.  Service was OK but nothing special.  Seemed some of the wait staff were new and did not know which tables they were serving. Cheesecake was wonderful. In the end not the experience of Ruth's Chris or Morton's.  Wanted to love it and may give one more shot on not such a busy night.",

Fortunate enough to have \"the company\" pick up the check and I along with a few co-workers went off for a nice dinner of cooked almost rare meat....ah!  For me it is always the Filet for these types of places due to the quality and leanness of the meat.  But like other \"well known\" steak places, the sides are also to die for as well.  Service here is top notch, as is to be expected, and doesn't disappoint.  From the time you walk in to the time you leave the servers are trying to make sure you have what you want when you want it and are fast and ready to answer any questions.  Wine selection is very good, though we weren't opening bottles this evening, just ordering by the glass.    Add in sides like several salad choices along with some great sides (jalapeno cheese spiced potatoes) along with some great desserts (didn't have one but watched a fellow diner indulge in the Cheese cake and she seemed happy.  And though I do have a bit of satisfaction of being able to check this establishment off my list, it certainly doesn't mean I'm not coming back.....because I am *grin*.",

    "text": "I'll admit it, I love steak. I could never, ever, survive as a vegetarian. So, naturally I was super excited to try Fleming's during Charlotte Restaurant Week and perhaps add them to my Charlotte \"steak place repertoire.\" Many, and I mean, many of my buds in Charlotte crush hard on Fleming's, but I'm really bummed to say that I just don't share in the love nearly as much.  Fleming's inside is lovely, a dimly lit and posh-like restaurant with a lovely bar and comfy seats. Fleming's also has one of the most impressive wine by the glass menus I've ever seen. They have roughly 100 wines by the glass and most of them are fairly priced.  I'll throw it out there right now that our server was friendly but a little distant, as he seemed a bit frazzled with his customers. I can only assume that Restaurant Week certainly made things busy for them.   On to the food. Here is how it panned out.   Bread: Fleming's offers two (tasty) spreads, feta cheese spread with chives, roasted red pepper spread. Yum.  Caesar Salad: Super fresh romaine with a healthy amount of Parmesan cheese shavings. However, the dressing was way too anchovy infused for my liking. That's just my preference though and I know that is a traditional Caesar, it was just too strong for me.  *Hubs and I split our main courses when they came to the table to create our own surf and turf.   Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes*: A generous portion of three jumbo crab cakes set with a side of remoulade. These cakes looked really, really pretty when they were placed in front of me. However, when I dove in I was a little disappointed. They were a bit fishy and a bit bland. I was looking for more spice, more pizazz, more POW. They just didn't do it for me.  Filet Mignon*: A beautiful piece of steak, but it came out a little undercooked for a medium (one side was a little purple-y), but hubs didn't care, he ate that side. While the meat was delicious, it was way over salted - to the point I had to chug down water because of the coarse salt I just rolled over my taste buds.   Sides: First up, Fleming's Potatoes, the star of the night. A big block of potato stuffed with jalapeno cheese and covered in cheddar cheese. Unhealthy? Oh yes. Delicious? Absolutely. We also ordered the asparagus which was just fine.   **Hubs and I also split our two desserts.   Desserts**: Cheesecake with Berry Sauce and Chocolate Mousse. I was delighted that the servers bring out delish Chantilly cream with every dessert. That's a nice touch. Overall, these desserts were good but not great. Nothing really to write home about - the chocolate mousse was a bit bland and one note, and I am a chocolate fiend. However, the cheesecake was rich and well made.   So, overall, I really wanted to add Fleming's into my steak house rotation, but based on this meal I just don't think it's going to happen. Maybe it was the rush of Restaurant Week or the late dining time we arrived for, but it just didn't live up to its hype. It wasn't a \"bad\" meal, it just didn't knock my socks off.  There are so many other fab steak joints in Charlotte that my taste buds and belly prefer to frequent.",

I guess you get what you pay for. Anyhow, another over priced and already dated and stale steakhouse kept alive by fat bankers and lawyers.

The only valet service that I saw was when I was already in the parking deck.   Anyway, the steak was the best I've had in Charlotte so far. I had the Prime Ribeye (I ordered it with no bone, and not dry aged) and my fiance had the Filet Mignon. It was incredibly tender for a Ribeye and tasted amazing. Perfectly cooked (medium rare) and seasoned. We also had the scallops (4) as an appetizer, they were seriously good. We also had green beans and macaroni and cheese as sides. I liked the macaroni and cheese, but I think I expected something more. We had a bottle  of Pinot Grigio because that's what my fiance likes, nothing special about it, but it was fine. I think it was the Kris. We got a slice of cheesecake for dessert and it was great.  It certainly was not cheap (by any means), but it may have been slightly less expensive than Ruth's Chris. Plan to spend some money, but the steak really is that good.  Great place for special occasions.",

Ok, first of all my husband made the reservations for our anniversary and so I went with the \"this is a special occasion\" mentality.  I have to say I was super impressed with the fact that the hostess immediately acknowledged the fact that it was our anniversary and politely said \"Happy Anniversary, I hope you enjoy your evening.\"  They sat us immediately.  The server seemed a little unorganized and a little unprofessional but that is okay--he also acknowledged our anniversary and introduced himself.  Shortly after we sat, one of the managers came over with a bottle of wine that my best friend had sent over to the table.  It was so thoughtful and certainly appropriate for this meal!    So far...sooo good, right?  Well the reason I only gave 3 stars is because of the meal and atmosphere.  I ordered a filet mignon and so did the hubs.  We ordered asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes for our side items.  The mashed potatoes were definitely creamy, flavorful and warm.  Very tasty.  The asparagus on the other hand, were thick and not crunchy but not soft...more like, chewy.  And they were room temperature.  The steak had a good peppercorn flavor and it sizzled on the plate (reminding me of Ruth's Chris) but there was quite a bit of fat on my steak.  It was too chewy in general and it didn't melt in my mouth, which is what I expect for the price.    As far as the atmosphere---it was loud and as others have described, very masculine.  I expected to look over and see a round table full of guidos and the Godfather at the head ( I can say that being Italian :)  There was a company gathering at the long table next to ours and they were cutting up and telling inner-office jokes the whole time.  I don't blame them, but I just didn't feel it set the romantic mood.  Plus we felt a little rushed by our waiter.  I think he was bored so he came over to check on us like 400 times.    On a positive note, they did give us an anniversary card and a free piece of chocolate cake.  They did \"try\" to make this a really special night but it just didn't quite hit the spot.  It seemed more like a bite off of Ruth's or Sullivan's.  It was a good effort but they didn't overly impress me...even with all the \"anniversary gimmicks.\"    I would return for a company lunch or something along those lines but the same concept is done much better at Sullivan's in my opinion.",

I was a little worried the food may not live up to the price tag, but I was wrong. 100% worth it. I had sirloin and lobster and it was amazing! Our server was very attentive to our party and at the end of the meal, the manager brought us complementary admission to one of the bars at The Epicenter. Overall, we had a really great experience and I hope to come back next time we are in the city.",

We barely saw our waitstaff, there were many times we were left with an empty table waiting for very long periods of time. Our steaks were very poor quality and not what we expect for this type of restaurant. The tip was at the end where our waitress asked if she could validate our valet parking ticket, then completely forgot about us while we sat waiting over 20 minutes at our empty table until we could find her to remind her she took our ticket over 20 minutes ago. We frequent steakhouses in Charlotte, and sadly aren't sure if we will be returning here after tonight's experience. We were very disappointed after previous experiences. With what we pay for a nice meal, decent service is expected also.",

We arrived a little before 8 and Had a good experience finding a seat in the bar area...and that was about it. The server took out order relatively fast but I think they went to raise the cattle after that!  Took an hour and a half to get our food and my dinner was cold!  I didn't date day anything because I was so hungry at that point I didn't want to wait another hour for my food! The parts of the beef that were warm were tasty but for an over priced piece of beef it really wasn't worth it.  The server messed up on our checks and added the misc foods on my check.  Save yourself the money -I've had better steak at Texas Road House. I won't go back.",

We wanted a quiet restaurant with a bit of a romantic feel, which for me means dimly lit, candles, well - you know the drill.  Fleming's delivered.  We skipped the preliminaries and headed right to the entrees. Ribeye and porcini rubbed filet mignon.  For sides, chipotle cheddar mac and cheese (decadent!) and mashed potatoes.  And aaaah, the wine. Seghesio Zinfandel and Silver Palm Cab.  Both great selections.  Sometimes it's just good to focus on the basics. No ten-word, fusion-inspired, incredibly complicated-to-prepare dishes,  Not that I'm opposed to that kind of thing!  But for what could be considered a simple meal, when it's as well-prepared and delicious as what's being served up at Fleming's, I give it 5 stars.  Bon appetit!",

    "text": "Super high peaks and really low valleys for this dining experience. I am actually so disappointed to have to write a bad review about this place.   Made a reservation on opentable for 5 (my sister and her friend were visiting Charlotte from Chicago) and was pleased about the seating location we were given in the restaurant, corner booth with windows. Awesome! Promptly greeted! Server told us about the last call wine menu and we ordered a great bottle of Pinot Noir. Entrees ordered, salads were delivered and service was excellent until we started noticing the time creeping along after all salad plates were cleared. It would be another 45 minutes before we would see our cold and improperly cooked entrees arrive at the table. And let me tell you, there is nothing worse than a server who feels so defeated by whatever circumstances happened to make the timing of the food not work out at their table that they can't even offer you any explanation for the delay or stay more than 5 seconds at your table to at least diffuse the situation. The manager did ask if there was anything they could do but it was so late and we were ready to get moving after being there for over an hour and a half before getting the entrees. We just ate cold food. Oh by the way, the funniest thing was when the food runner said, \"super hot plates, be careful\" and the plates were stone cold, the drawn butter for the lobster was already congealed. Comical. Oh well. Won't be going back there ever again. Generously have this experience 2 stars because the manager gave us a round of top shelf drinks at the end. Maybe in an effort to get us drunk so we wouldn't remember?",

Crabmeat was excellent, steaks were cooked properly but we're chewy and extremely fatty. All three steaks. Fourth person ordered the valentines special, lobster and filet. Lobster was over cooked and tough, steak was ordered medium rare and was also tough and a little dry. The sides were excellent. We got calamari, scallop potatos, and Brussel sprouts. The salad wedge was not up to par. Instead of fresh sprinkled bacon which is what I expected it came with one slice of thick bacon undercooked and not very meaty. When I complained waitress said the next time I order ask for the crumbled bacon. Too bad there won't be a next time for this restaurant. Now I know why there were a lot of empty tables.",

Most high end steakhouses normally have all the same steaks and pretty much taste the same.  The one thing that sets Fleming's apart from other steakhouses is their sides.  Since I don't eat seafood, it's nice when a restaurant has Mac and cheese without lobster.  And their creamed spinach is really good. Any time I want to celebrate an occasion... you can trust that I'm picking Fleming's as my go to celebratory meal.  Not only that.... for my anniversary, they gave us a $25 gift card and a box of chocolates.  those personal touches really makes a difference.  The staff is always friendly and tentative to our needs.  I'm hoping that they will one day open another location in Charlotte. Food this good... deserves to have multiple locations",

We ordered the 14 ounce ribeye and a side of mashed potatoes which we shared both. The steak was so flavorful and the size to share between the both of us was perfect. That visit was back in October 2016. now for our second time going I went with my husband for restaurant week January 2017. Our waitress was amazing and the service was great we ordered a mushroom ravioli for an appetizer which was delicious but needed salt, I ordered the fillet and a side of truffle mashed potatoes, and the blueberry cheesecake for dessert. The fillet was good flavoring but overdone.. The cheesecake was OK but honestly I feel as though it tasted like one of those Jell-O no bake cheesecake's  if my second visit was my first time going then I would never return so I mixed as to why I had such different experiences. I think overall I would give it one more chance.",

They have several options, including the prime rib burger, the mushroom ravioli, Cajun shrimps, calamari, beef carpaccio, and the new addition: pork belly with chuney and goat cheese grits.   I have been here several times, food is good especially for the price. The most recent visit (last Thursday) I tried the pork belly and carpaccio. I was a little disappointed in the pork belly, it was rather bland. But the grits and chuney were yummy. The carpaccio was ok, they could have gone lighter on the sauce and I wasn't getting the little mount of greens in the middle.  I think the calamari, ravioli and the shrimps were the best bets.   Service was good.  We were not \"big spenders,\" but water and soda were filled regularly. Bartender checked on us every so often. We were in and out in 45 minutes. I am a fan of Flemings for quick bites at a great price with solid food and service.",

The place was loud with pre-concert goers, but waitstaff was patient, professional, and took good care of us until the hubbub died down.  Waiter showed us how we could take advantage of the restaurant week menu to still get exactly what we wanted at a lower rate.  Stopped at the front desk on the way out to ask about a taxi; the sr manager, who'd come by and chatted with us earlier during dinner, immediately ran out to the street and hailed us a taxi himself.

The part that really bothered me was the manager actually looked at it and saw that it was burned and they took it back to the kitchen - but then the bartender/server came back out & told us that the kitchen said it wasn't burned that we were probably just tasting the chocolate?

The meal came with a scallop appetizer over risotto and your choice of a wedge salad or french onion soup.  The scallop was good.  It was seared to perfection and cooked just right.  The garnish, which was scallop green, was browned on the edges and looked a little old. The risotto was a little plain.  My filet was cooked exactly as ordered, but my husbands was a touch over cooked.  We ordered both of our steaks rare.  The lobsters tails were a bit rubbery from being overcooked, which was a bit of a disappointment.   Our meals came with a choice of french onion soup or a wedge salad.  We both ordered the wedge.  My lettuce looked like it was on the verge of being brown.  It was a little wilted.  Overall, the meal was a little disappointing.

    "text": "Had a very pleasant early Friday night dinner here last night. Everything was delicious and our waiter Jerry was charming and professional. We ordered appetizers AND desserts (which we never ever do) because we didn't want to miss out on anything. We ate it all. There is a homey non pretentious vibe to the place that makes it wonderfully relaxing and a home run for us. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "We visited Fleming's for the first time on a recent Friday evening.  I had always had the impression that it would be \"stuffy,\" pretentious, and geared toward the older affluent couple.  I was impressed when we walked in that it wasn't any of those.  It was fairly modernly decorated, and there were younger couples and groups there.    We each started with a glass of red wine (at the lower end of the price scale), which was delicious.  Items on the menu are a la carte, so the cost of the bill can quickly add up.  Our server brought us bread to start, so we skipped the appetizers and too highly priced salads, and ordered our entrees.  I tried the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon (cooked to medium).  It came with a few asparagus spears and a gorgonzola sauce (which truly sold the entree for me).  The steak was cooked \"just right\" for me and had a lot of flavor which the sauce complemented perfectly.  For my side, I ordered the creamed spinach.  It was good, too, although my heart (and stomach) still belongs to the creamed spinach served at Boston Market (go figure, right?).    My partner ordered the pork chop.  When I asked how it was, he replied, \"It's okay.\"  It was a big piece of meat and looked delicious and moist, so I asked what that meant.  I tried it and, he was right.  It was just okay.  It really didn't have a lot of flavor or spices to it.  He said it tasted much better when it was combined with the creole mustard glaze and julienned apples.   The service was great and our bill came to $100 for the two of us with two glasses of wine, two entrees, and two sides.  It was really good (at least my meal was), but a bit spendy for us to do outside of special occasions.  Plus, there was no Epicentre parking garage validation.",

    "text": "I had the Alaskan King Crab Legs, Mac Cheese, Spinach, & Onion Rings. Everything was delicious! Best onion rings I've ever had - with a hot sauce that was perfect with them. The crab legs came with butter that was warmed by an underneath flame.   The waiter was attentive. However, the man who brought the wine brought the wrong kind instead of just telling us the one we wanted was no longer available & offering comparable options.",

    "text": "This is hands down the best Flemings I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. The burger is equally delicious as the steak. The steak is as good as the onion rings. The water is even amazing. I jest. Sort of. If you've ever eaten at a steakhouse, and can tell what quality vs imitation ambiance is, then you will truly appreciate this place. The lighting, the friendly yet classy atmosphere, the complete lack of high nosed snobbery yet respect of both management and staff to all the patrons that roam this place. It is incredible.   If your in town or a local, check it out, enjoy some delicious food and I'm pretty dang sure you won't regret it. This place sets the standard of what a Fleming's should be.",
