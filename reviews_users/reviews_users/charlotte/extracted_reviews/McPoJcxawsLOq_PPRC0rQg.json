There was deliciously sweet iced tea, all you can eat hush puppies, the biggest onion rings I've ever seen.  Then, of course, there was the meat.  I found it interesting that ribs were ribs, but barbecue was what I would just call pulled pork.  Both were delicious.  If I were ever in Charlotte again, I'd stop in.",

It's a bit out of the way for me (Sunset Blvd.), but when I'm in the area it's a classic stop for some tasty Carolina 'cue.   I think I kick up my 3.5 rating to 4.0 as the service has been just so kind. Bubba is one of the nicest restaurant owners I've ever met and the servers are truly salt of the Earth people. Plus, Bubba often donates product to a local charity for events, which makes this place aces in my book.   As for the food, you'll be in and out in no time as the food comes out in a flash. I typically order the petite plate as and I unfortunately enjoy the included hush puppies a bit too much. :) It's not the best 'cue I've had in Charlotte, but I do enjoy it quite a bit!   The digs are pretty basic and nondescript, but I'm usually there to grab a quick bite of 'cue and if I'm in the need of a major sugar rush - a sweet tea.",

Located in North Charlotte off exit 16 (Sunset Blvd West), this place is simple and tries to be nothing more. This is your typical NC BBQ w/vinegar sauce being the specialty. Hush puppies are so delightful that a basket must accompany any BBQ. The pork is so moist that not much sauce is needed, though I love to get the hands messy with a proper dousing of the vinegar based sauce. Great for a quick eat in or massive take out. Apparently they cater too!   Make sure to check out the men's room (men and women alike) as Bubba, who is there most days, will give you a good laugh at his creation.",

This was my first time with hush puppies, and boy were they good. The pulled pork was best smothered in their vinegar based sauce (another first) and regular barbecue sauce. It was simple but tasty.   Our server was nice, but the real treat was when a guy who I'm assuming was Bubba himself came out to greet us. He joked around a bit and sent my friend and I into the mens restroom to find out if we were men or not (see the image on this page). That capped off the night nicely.   As a real southern cookin noob', I had a great experience.",

The location is nothing pretentious, just your basic hole in the wall BBQ joint.  They do Eastern North Carolina Style BBQ (vinegar and pepper sauce), and they have a red tomato based sauce for chicken and ribs.  I had a combo of chopped pork bbq and a bbq chicken breast quarter.  The chicken was incredible, and the sauce, a little on the spicy side, complimented it very well.  The BBQ was just a little dry and definitely needed sauce, and the vinegar sauce complimented it very well too.  I also had slaw, baked beans, and a small bowl of Brunswick stew.  I wish I had ordered something other than the slaw--I'm sure there are people who like vinegar based cumin seed full slaw, but I prefer mine mayonnaise based--just personal preference.  The beans were exquisite, you could taste the molasses and brown sugar in every bite.  The Brunswick stew was the most different I had ever seen.  It had the consistency of a cross between white chicken chili and chicken and dumplins.  It was quite good and included chicken, tomatoes, lima beans, and corn.  Although it was different it was some of the best I've ever tasted.  If I were a local I'd definitely be a regular.",

So with a quick look at the menu I ordered a BBQ sandwich ( no slaw this time I wanted to be able to taste the flavor of the Q then have slaw next time) So out came my sandwich and I noticed slaw on the outside of the sandwich I opened it and saw that the slaw well... some of it had been taken off about half was still there it looked as if someone had taken something and attempted to \" get the slaw off\".When I told the server she looked at the ticket and said \" I told them no slaw \" Then she left with the sandwich at this point I am wondering if they could not get a simple order with such a slow time then what else was wrong? At that point I had spent way to much time just trying to get a simple sandwich put money on the table to pay for the Tea and left . I called shortly after a conference call to talk to the manager \" Bubba \" I told him the story and he first said \" describe the server \" then when I did he said \" What color was the slaw \" And I am thinking why would he ask that? Does he think the slaw came from somewhere else? When I told him I was not 100% sure he \"said we only serve this color slaw\"( I think he said yellow) And I am still wondering why he said that? ( AGAIN) To me this was getting me know where when I was just trying to explain to him what the problem was. I then just said \" have a good day and hung up\" Do not think I will be back ... just a warning if you go to Bubbas do not keep it to simple and please please do not make the order very complicated. They may ask you where the food came from?",

    "text": "Being born and raised in Eastern North Carolina has made me really biased about eastern style barbecue, but I have to say that this is some of the worst eastern style barbecue that I've ever had.  I've been here a few times and on each of my three visits, i have to say that the BBQ really disappoints.  This is the first eastern style barbecue I've had that has nearly no seasoning.  During my last visit, I decided to pony up the extra money and just buy a bottle of their vinegar based sauce to season the meat with.  Even after all of that, it still wasn't very good.  I recommend that they use more salt, pepper and vinegar when cooking the hog.  With that being said about the terrible BBQ, the rest of the food is actually pretty decent.  I really like their fried chicken, coleslaw, potato salad and other dishes.  I haven't tried the chicken and dumplings yet, but my friends say it's really good.  The staff is always friendly and attentive and I really like the comical signs that they have outside.  I'd recommend this place for fried chicken and good sides, but I can't give the thumbs up to anyone regarding their eastern chopped barbecue.",

    "text": "This is one of the best BBQ places in the Charlotte area (and one of the older ones since it was originally Spoon's Barbecue) , and they serve some excellent country cooking items as well. The pork here is whole hog, Eastern NC style barbecue cooked in electric pits with a few hickory chips thrown in near the end, and thus has little smokiness, but properly sauced it has a decent taste, though it is a little too finely chopped, in my opinion. The sauce is vinegar based, Eastern NC style without a lot of heat. This is good, solid, but not spectacular, chopped BBQ.  The slaw is the yellow version ( a little mustard is added) found generally only in the east (and even there, sparingly, and I really like it, on either a plate or a sandwich. Hush puppies are very nice, among my favorites, as well. Their French Fries are just great, about as good as you'll find in any NC BBQ joint - I love'em. The BBQ Chicken here is nice also. The Brunswick Stew is ok, but doesn't wow you.  The Chicken and Dumplings are very much worth a shot, as is the meatloaf, and beef tips. Sides are consistently good. This place is what it is, a solid, above average BBQ joint, and there simply aren't that many decent NC style barbecue choices in the Charlotte area. You can do much worse than eat a meal or two here.",

If you're looking for some pork with a vinegar sauce, Bubba's will be fine...and it does have a faint hint of smoke...but traditional Eastern Carolina Q?  Not in my world.

    "text": "This was our third night in the Charlotte area and we had not yet tried to find some barbecue.  Bubba's looked like a good choice and was not too far from our hotel.  We were a little early and pretty much had the place to ourselves at first.  Hushpuppies were provided.  They were not sweetened but were fairly oniony which covered up the mild corn flavor.  We prefer them without onion.  The coleslaw was the yellow mustardy style that apparently you get in this part of the world.  I've heard it called Eastern style, but can't say I've had it this way at the other places I've been in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain.  Maybe I have just forgotten.  This one had a flavor that I had a hard time identifying.  I'm sure it came from the mustard, but is not mustard seed itself.  It reminded me of bathroom cleaner, really.  I spent most of the meal trying to figure it out, then it came to me.  They are using a flavored prepared mustard, perhaps mint or some other herb.  I found it unpleasant and distracting.  Bottom line is I did not like this version.    The green beans are pretty plain with just some onion added.  They needed salt, a splash of vinegar and a little barbecue meat, side meat or jowl or something.  The baked beans were actually the best side and they were also pretty simple.  They were probably seasoned with the rib sauce which is very dark, kind of Kansas City style.  The ribs were full untrimmed spare ribs with plenty of fat.  They were not smoked, showing no pink from the process and leaving no smoke on your hands.  I don't believe they were grilled either.  Grill flavor was not there.   Whether I am correct or not, they appeared to be roasted somehow.  Later I read that they use an electric cooker, so that could explain it.  They were also very solid, toothy.  I don't want mush and don't fully subscribe to the fall-off-the-bone preference, but these were not done.  So they were underdone roast pork with an herb rub that was hidden by that heavy KC style sauce.  They are served individually cut apart.  You could never pull them apart at the table.  The chopped pork barbecue was pretty much the same as the ribs in having no smoke (again the electric cooker).  Their sauce is just vinegar and red pepper, with no salt.  I have eaten a lot of eastern style sauces and love them.  This was crude and did not help the pork much.  The meat was chopped medium fine.  It was served sauced about right, not wet or dry and not fatty.  I don't expect heavy smoke in Eastern NC pork, but a little please.  This was just roasted pork to me.  Some places you get poorly conceived and poorly made food.  Those I give 1-2 stars.  This was not like that, it was just not my style.  So I give them credit (three stars) for what they do, I think it is a matter of personal preference.  This experience scared us out of any further tries for barbecue while in Charlotte.  We will save it for our next trip that takes us to Raleigh and points east.",

I've never seen pork BBQ chopped so fine and the vinegar-based sauce was just what I wanted.  Hushpuppies were great and an added bonus.  Potato salad was unusual and delicious.  The place had alot of regulars and it's always a plus when the owner comes out and talks to you.  My girlfriend remembered it from 20+ years ago and we ended buying a T-shirt, his sauces and BBQ to go!",

The pork is the finely chopped eastern style. Sauce again the thin eastern style.   Which is OK, but nothing distinguishing about any of it.  Portions were good.  Price average for the area.  In summary, I won't go out of my way to eat here again.  Better Q out there for sure.  But if there at the suggestion of others in a group, I'll be OK with it.",

I recommend it for lunch if your headed this way.    Update. I hadn't tried the o rings prior to posting.  Pass.  They are frozen. Or atleast not spectacular.    Like i said.  Good lunch spot.

The food was really good -- not the best BBQ I'd ever had -- but fast and convenient and just what we wanted to eat.  The price was reasonable and the iced tea flowed freely.  I spoke to the owner afterwards who was very welcoming and appreciated our business (very nice!)  He said they mainly catered to their regular locals, so it was nice to see someone come in off the highway.  A nice place to visit if you're in the area.  Give them a try!",

We picked the ribs, chicken tenders, baked beans, potato salad and onion rings. The ribs were not fall off the bone tender so not my style at all. Kids said the tenders were okay and we had to buy buns for the chopped bbq (they did come steamed).

    "text": "By now, everyone has seen or heard of 'Kitchen Nightmares'. If you haven't, here's a brief synopsis: Chef Gordon Ramsay visits various eateries on the verge of closing, to determine what's wrong and help them turn around. In all cases, it starts with the food being very bad, followed by the owner(s) trying to do everything to bring back the customers- except fix the actual problem- the horrible food.  This is the problem with Bubba's.  As one pulls into the parking lot, it's hard not to notice the lack of vehicles in a near-empty parking lot- which is odd, seeing that the fast food joints in its vicinity are full, or near capacity (this should be red-flag #1 to go elsewhere).  Walking, in, you'll notice a smattering of awards on the wall- none of which are recent (and all are very dusty.). This theme direction continues in the main dining area, with seemingly hundreds of fading photos showing people wearing Bubba's t-shirts, and fake cartoon art imitating the styles of Bob Kane, Jack Kirby and others, along with a smattering of non-related purchased framed art. I won't even go into the gimmicks contained in the men's bathroom  So, what about the food? In a word: horrendous.  The chicken and pork were incredibly tasteless, dry and overcooked, as if they had sitting in a convection oven for a couple of hours.  The meatloaf, aside from being totally tasteless, seemed like it had been cooked via being boiled in a pot of water.  The Hushpuppies were near-inedible, tasting and smelling like they had been cooked in rancid grease that had not been changed in months.  The cole-slaw was practically dry, cut-up cabbage, with little to no mayo vinegar or anything resembling a sauce you would expect to find in coleslaw, anywhere in the world.  The green beans tasted like they were straight out of a can, that had been opened and dumped on the plate.   The potatoes in the potato salad were incredibly under cooked, with a crunchy texture.  The deserts appear to all have been purchased from Walmart- and they taste like it.  So, how do they stay in business? How is it that they haven't folded? Simply put, they have one-time business customers: they advertise on the freeway. Potential suckers see them listed on the \"food/gas/lodging\" sign, and stop in, thinking they're going to have a meal of Carolina BBQ, which it is technically True   My advice: stay away. Stay far far way. You'll be far better off going to Denny's or going hungry for an hour, and finding some other place to eat at. This place is a disgrace to not only Carolina-style, but BBQ in general.",
