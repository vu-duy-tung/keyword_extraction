This is regarding food then the ambience was just as bad the wait staff looks like they didn't care just to put it in a nutshell service as bad as the grilled meats. It's a disappointment.",

Then the mixed grill of chicken, lamb and beef came...Sigh.......it was SO DRY! Very large portions, tasty rice but the meats were all dry. We had dinner at 7:30 so I don't know if you need to come earlier to get more \"moist\" meat? I definitely plan to give it another try, but probably during lunch. On a side note: I have been to their other restaurant several times and it has always been excellent.",

Califlower app is very good but don't expect it to be healthy since its fried with batter that tastes great but eliminates califlower health benefits. Don't bring your own bottle of wine to Kebob Je - they have no beer or wine license and tell you to Byob but once you arrive they gouge you with a $12 \"corking fee\" (that they want to be tipped on top of...for the pleasure of bringing your own bottle). Pita bread was cold and tough. Rice was literally like something from a box with some raisins and poorly integrated zuchinni and squash thrown on top. Literally could not have been done with any less flavor and attention to detail. Grape leaves are ok at 2.5 to 3 stars served cold. Nothing special. Overall this place offers some authentic Lebanese food offered with less than focused execution. Up-fit/decor is cheezy and poorly coordibated. Some nice elements thrown in with some really tacky elements. Servers are not terribly trained...nice and attentive but poorly trained. If you need a lamb kabob, this place has good lamb kabobs. Otherwise, persue other alternatives.",

    "text": "I really love coming to this place! My husband and I die in here at least once a month. Today we came for lunch. We usually get the same items every time period I always get the grilled chicken. I cannot say enough about the chicken at this place. It is so savory and tasty. I cannot even begin to explain how good it actually is. The grill chicken comes with rice and vegetables. The portion sizes are few mungas. Plenty for you to have as a meal while you're at the restaurant and then to bring leftovers home! My husband always gets the mixed grill. This I believe has several different types of meat and also comes with rice in vegetables. They have drink selections but they mostly come out of a can or a bottle. I usually just get water. As an appetizer I suggest the stuffed grape leaves. They are served warm. I believe they give you 5 or 6 of them in they are pretty big. There is a place to dine outside should you want to do that period we dined outside today but usually dine inside at night. Over all this is our go to place for mediterranean food. The service is always wonderful in the food comes out very quickly. If you want a reasonably priced a meal that is going to fill up your belly this is the place to go!",

Too small, dry and did not taste fresh. I've also attached a picture of the lamb kabob from a different evening when it was delicious.  We called in to voice our disappointment over the quantity and quality difference from previous meals, as well as for the extra charge, and the woman on the phone was rude, instead of offering to fix things.

Let me start by saying, WOW.  I enjoy Mediterranean food immensely and have had it in many restaurants and Kabob-Je did not disappoint.  We were warmly greeted and sat quickly.  We went over the menu.  I admit, I had anticipated eating here so I had looked at their menu online earlier. We started with the Hummus and Falafel appetizers.  They came out very fast.  They both were served with a large, freshly baked piece of pita.  The falafel was very good and the menu claimed it to be vegan which is good to know.  It was served with many accompaniments; tahini, lettuce, diced tomato, diced radish, fresh parsley and mint leaves.  The Hummus was probably the best I have ever had.  It was extremely smooth and creamy.  Without asking our server brought us more freshly baked pita. It was so fresh it was still pillowed with steam!  Our entrees came next. My partner ordered the Shrimp Kabobs and I had the Scallop Kabobs. Both were served with generous portions of grilled vegetables (squash, zucchini, onion) and yellow basmati rice topped with dried fruit. It was a sensational meal, some of which we brought home to finish later.  I watched the other tables to see what other dishes looked enticing.  I will follow up this post with another detailing our next visit, which if I have my way will be soon!",

We had soooo much food that we're leaving with two bags worth of to-go containers. The desserts are amazing, the smoked eggplant is phenomenal, the falafel is out of this world, and don't get me started on the desserts. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte without a doubt. I've been trying to find a place I can go to for some good food and now that I have found it you won't find me going anywhere else!!",

    "text": "Started with the fried cauliflower appie, which is pleasantly, not breaded. Coated with mixture of Lebanese seasonings & drizzled with tahini sauce makes this dish addicting!  Many of you have mentioned this item & I finally tried it! Yum! Next appetizer, Mutabal (aka baba ghanoush) served with fresh baked pita that comes to the table hot & puffed like a pillow. Need I say more?! My friend and I shared these apples and I could have stopped eating at this point. But, I wanted to try a new dish so I went for the spicy Lenanese sausage w.a side order of Batata Harra. Cubed potatoes tossed in garlic, coriander, a touch of chili and a thin white sauce (possibly tahini). One of my favorites! However, the texture of the sausage was very unpleasant for me. It's between a chorizo and jerky texture, dry & tough. The menu doesn't note thinly sliced sausage and I expected a whole, juicy link.  But, Kabob Je has such an exceptional level of customer service that a server noticed, came over and took it away (which I never do) & asked if I would like something else. Well, of course. I ordered Lahem Meshwi: 2 lamb kabobs that were moist, tender & complimented with a smoky grilled flavor. I had potatoes and more than half the lamb entree to take home. Great portions! My friend had their delicious Grilled Lamb sandwich. Excellent as always, attentive and friendly service. A win-win!",

It was a little after 1:00 so the lunch rush was over.  I asked about the open tables for 4. Was told they were saved if larger parties came in.

The amount of people crowding the place on a Wednesday at 1pm goes to show that.    I started with some hummus, which was smooth and tasty.  The bread is awesome, and they will keep bringing it so be careful not to fill up before your sandwich comes.    A word to the wise - if you start with an appetizer, don't bother with a side.  I got the spicy potatoes and they were AMAZING!  I just could eat them all, and still had some of my Kafta Sandwich left.  The Kafta was OK, nothing out of the world, but the sandwich was pretty tasty.  It was a pretty pricey visit for lunch, but I want to go back and try more!",

It seems like they are still working out the kinks as service was less than we usually see at the original location.  The food was pretty good.  My wife loved the lentil soup, just as good as usual.  My shawarma wrap was ok, more on how it was made than the actual food.  They put too much sauce which completely soaked through the pita.  After eating half of it, I had to stop because of how messy it was becoming.  The taste was still good, but the texture was off.  Our falafel was delicious as usual.  The owner was there and walking through during the meal.  With his attention they should get things up to the standard of the other location pretty quick.  We will give them another shot after Thanksgiving.",

The menu features traditional  cold and hot appetizers, salads and entrees especially  kababs of lamb , seafood , chicken ,  salmon, sandwiches  lentil soup side orders like basmati rice and desserts such as baklava and cake . There is also a kids menu available.  They don't serve alcoholic beverages ,  but there is a $10 uncorking fee if you bring your own bottle of wine. My dining mates and I ordered shrimp kebab plate,  chicken kebab plate and the special of the day which was a salmon, shrimp and scallop kebab with a side order of hummus and a Fattoush salad . Food came out hot , plated nicely , large portions and meat and fish very tender. Menu prices reasonable for what you get served. Staff was friendly and attentive . Although, noisy we enjoyed this restaurant very much and will return and try some other menu choices. By the way the hummus was the best I ever had in a long time!",

This location is small  but we were quickly seated. Our waiter brought us pita bread and took our drink orders and our food was brought to us about 10 minutes after we ordered.  We ordered the spicy potatoes, chicken kabobs, and an extra side of the rice.  Now, I haven't been here in a while and it seems like some things have changed.  I remember the rice used to have nuts in it and the vegetable selection was different. I believe there used to be carrots in the mix which I really enjoyed, but none were there when we went Sunday.  It was just squash and zucchini with maybe some red pepper.  I ended up not eating the vegetables because I didn't enjoy the selection. The rice was still fine but the nuts (slivered almonds?) make it even better so I think they should bring that back.  It's still a solid place to get your Mediterranean fix but I think I have a preference for some other spots in Charlotte.",

The owner of the Matthews location is ALWAYS on top of it and is the best host.  Stonecrest on the other hand has some issues with atmosphere. This is the loudest restaurant I have ever been in. If the small dining room is full you cannot have a conversation. Unfortunately there is no solution to this problem. My suggestion would be carry out only unless the place is near empty.   Some of the best mediterranean food in Charlotte....",

While some small details differed from the Matthews location, which is usually the location we visit, none were met with disappointment.  One of my family's favorite aspects of Kebab Je's is wrapping up our meal with the Kaneffah dessert.  The four of us agreed to share one, which is difficult thing to do.  You'd understand once you've tasted this unique dessert.  Always a great finishing to a meal we all always enjoy.  Which is why we'll keep coming back to Matthews and the Stonecreat location.  The staff is very warm and welcoming and the food never disappoints.",

Any hot sandwich with fries 7.95 so I ordered the chicken an the young man asked me if I wanted a side. At first I said no but than he said it was 7.52 an I said the special comes with fries for 7.95. I told him with fries, now I added a dollar tip. So it was 8.52 , I waited for my food which for lunch they were not busy. He hands me my sandwich an I said I got fries , he said thats extra , What!!! I said its the special with fries , he said a dollar extra  I did not have the time or patience to explain common sense to him!! So for 8.52 I received a small chicken pita, which was just okay. He was suppost to ring up the special for 7.95 with fries but he charged me for just the sandwich grrr I do not recommend this eatery at all. You'd have better food an service at Zoes kitchen.

    "text": "Right now I seem to be obsessed with falafel and Mediterranean food.  And when we were looking for dinner before a movie. I saw a sign for Kabob JE.   The space is a little crammed but we were seated quickly. As you walk in, the aroma of the grill fills the air. And there's a case of kabobs marinating and a pile of fresh homemade pitas back where staff is cooking.   First thing you should know is you get a lot of food with whatever you order. We started off with a falafel plate as an appetizer and it did not disappoint.  It was four large pieces of falafel over a salad served with fresh pita. Their falafel had been my favorite.  Crisp on the outside and flavorful on the inside. It wasn't dry, which is usually my issue with falafel. I was full after this.   I ordered a veggie plate where you get to choose between various items. I got the stuffed grape leaves, smoked eggplant, fattoush and spicy potatoes. The grape leaves were good, but I wish more rice was inside. The smoked eggplant was my least favorite on the plate, but it definitely has a smoky flavor. I spread it more on that delicious pita. The fattoush was good. Veggies were crisp and the toasted pita mixed in great. The potatoes were the star of my meal. Great flavor and addictive.  I have to these again when I come back. My husband's meal was just as good. We both had leftovers.   The only thing we disliked was that sodas were served in bottles verses fountain drinks. We'll both just have water next time.   Amazing food, savory dishes and crisp veggies. We'll be back!",

I thought the chicken was s little bit chewy.  I am always??  I am always irked when restaurants don't have Sweet and Low as a sweetener option.  Some of us don't like Splenda.  The noise level was slightly above average, but Ginn and I were there right during the lunch hour.  All in all, very average.  I think there are better choices for Mediterranean food.

We enjoyed the chicken kabob sandwich and the chicken koofta and they were both good (4/5).  The sandwich chicken was tasty as was the yogurt dressing.  I wish it had lettuce and tomato vs the pickles which were a bit overpowering for me.  The dish was good and the rice had golden raisins and dried cranberries.  The service was excellent as well (5/5).  But the seating is a bit cramped as the tables made you feel you were on top of each other at times (3/5). Overall thou8, very good experience!",

    "text": "It is imperative to state up front that this exceptional Mediterranean restaurant, Kabob Je Rotisserie & Grill, actually replaced the much inferior Kabob Grill that had resided in the same Stonecrest location for several years. Other than the name \"Kabob,\" the two restaurants have nothing in common; in fact, Kabob Je addressed every deficiency of the prior tenant from its lame pita bread to the rude servers. Its Matthews' location had become our favorite restaurant the past couple of years and we are almost giddy about having this second location so near by at Stonecrest Shopping Center.    On this Sunday lunch visit (our first), we were pleased to find a packed dining room with its proud owner, Yasar, happily greeting us and other guests upon entry. His continual involvement and his carefully selected staff make every visit a special event.  You cannot go wrong with anything you choose from the menu and we have tried about everything. Normally however, we split the Mixed Grill Plate at $16 along with a Vegetable Plate at $12. The mixed grill contains one skewer each of lamb, chicken and beef Kafka along with yellow rice with raisins and grilled veggies. It includes a delicious white garlic dipping sauce. The veggie plate contains any four items from a group of about ten. We usually go with the toubolah salad, grape leaves, falafel and hummus, each made fresh in-house by two chefs that specialize in them.  The star of the show however is the incredible, freshly baked pita bread that is served with every meal. It is baked in a conspicuously displayed special brick open and is served piping hot. Desserts, though not made in-house, are also excellent, particularly the salted caramel custard that is so good that it should include a cigarette (even for nonsmokers like me). Hold on a second... I'm getting a little woozy just thinking about it...  Service is consistently superb and sanitation scores are always high. It probably comes as no surprise, that this place is a Gotta Try!",

The original location in Matthews always has my heart, but the 2nd location in Stonecrest is a great sign that the business is growing and more delicious food will be brought upon Charlotte/Matthews.  The location is off the side of the main Stonecrest \"drag\"... the restaurant front faces Regal Cinemas... I didn't see an outdoor seating area (like Matthews) but it is also winter... so it could just not be set up.  I think they \"inserted this location\" into the space so the dining area has two rows of tables and the kitchen feels like it takes the majority of the space.  A small display case with kabobs will catch your eye as you move your way in... all the smells and the meats rotating in the kitchen makes for a cool ambiance.    The server was super nice and checked in enough... also gave us time to consider the specials.    I was surprised how busy the place was for Friday lunch, but maybe folks were starting their weekends early and playing hooky from work.  Either way... good to see the crowd and lots of people patronizing this place.",

    "text": "Ok this place deserves all the hype. I had the Grilled Lamb Sandwich with Saffron Basmati Rice as a side. It was absolutely delicious and their prices are great which makes it even better. The sandwich just bursted with flavor in your mouth and it was a moment you didn't want to ever come to an end. Also sampled some other foods my friends got and there wasn't anything I didn't really like! Wish this place wasn't 2-3 hours from where I live! The service was also fast and delightful. Heard the dessert was also amazing but unfortunately didn't have room to try any! There will for sure be a next time and I'd consider this a Charlotte staple!",

    "text": "I give the food a 5 star rating.  My family and I came here for the first time. We got the family platter, it had enough to feed 6 or 7 people! It was amazing and tasty. Such a great deal! The pita bread was delicious, the hummus was perfect. I will recommend this place to anyone visiting the Charlotte or Matthews areas. This was better than a lot of places in Los Angeles. The steak was tender, juicy, and medium rare. The chicken was cooked well and juicy. The kabob was great. The rice was moist.  I give the food a 5 star rating.   The service is what brought it down to a 4 star. I feel kinda bad, but I must be honest. The server was nice, but we all felt uncomfortable with his communication style. He just kept talking to us about the food or how he got hired, etc, but it was not a natural way of speaking as he never stopped. If he would learn to stop being chatty, I would give him a better rating.",
