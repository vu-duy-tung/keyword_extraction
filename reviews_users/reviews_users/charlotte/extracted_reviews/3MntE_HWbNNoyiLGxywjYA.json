The first time was a Mac and Cheese pizza (really good) and the second time was their \"Taco Topper\" pizza which I was really impressed with! Perfectly cooked and loaded with ingredients! It truly was like eating a taco except better! The Cinnastix were less than impressive, they were over cooked and weren't very good, Dominoes still wins hands down for their cinnastix. Overall, it was good food but horrible prices. $14.99 for a medium pizza, they need to lower their prices especially being in a state that's virtually bankrupt. They could be a little faster on their delivery too considering the hotel is only about 3 minutes from the restaurant, wait time is about 45 minutes.",

They do have a varied menu and are open very late, but i wouldn't eat most of the things on the menu.  I guess the food appeals more to drunk college kids than to me, but if you're ordering food at 3 am, it's likely that the quality you are expecting is below par.  If you go for a cheese pizza you should be ok, but you'd be just as well off with a frozen pie from the grocery.",

This is another place we have ordered up from more than once because its close to our house and I will say their delivery is fast.  But, everytime the food arrives, we are ALWAYS disappointed with some aspect of it and the price is just too much.  We ordered a large specialty pizza and a dozen boneless wings and it was $33!!!  With that kind of money I could have purchased three large pizzas at a place like Domino's and gotten better quality.  Plus, they didn't tell us the total over the phone so it was just a bombshell when it arrived.  The taco pizza is gross, the grinders are too small, and the \"Topperstix\" aren't great either.  I do, however, like the boneless wings and we've had the macaroni and cheese pizza......I hate to say it, but it's damn tasty.  All in all, pretty weak food.  They get a star for fast delivery and another for the mac and cheese, but that's about it.",

    "text": "Got to a hotel late night as we missed a flight. We were very tired and hungry. My son wanted pizza. So we ordered from Toppers. The place and concept is good. They were very busy as a lot of hotels were filled with passengers on either cancelled or delayed flights.   We ordered our food with a guy name Khalil. He put us on hold numerous times. The music on hold was stating their beverage deals were : a 2 liter for $2 and two 20oz for $2. So after he finally come on the line, I asked him if they had any deals. He mentioned a few of the pizza deals but just ended up ordering a large pie with half buffalo chicken and the other half with mushroom, peppers, and sausage also added onions and jalapenos. Also medium order of boneless wings. (Hot buffalo - it was spicy and good)  I mentioned that I wanted to take advantage of the beverage deals. Ordered a 2 liter of Diet Coke and 2 Dasani 20oz.   They over charged me for the water. Instead of charging 2 for $2 they charged me $2 each. They also got me for a $2.25 delivery fee they did not mentioned to me.   So I called the restaurant back and mentioned them about the over charge. Instead of apologizing the guy who took my order who happens to be the manager states \"well it is your fault for not mentioning the deal\". I told him that I did. He stated that it is your word against mine.   I still told him that if he just acknowledges that they made a mistake I would want him to give the extra $2 to the deliver guy ( who by the way was already tipped $4 by me on top of the delivery fee.   While good food and service can take a business to the sky, being rude and disrespectful to your customers can only eventually bring down a business.   I would want everybody who reads this to just make sure of what they are charging before paying. Also I would hope that this so called \"manager\" gets reprimanded by the owner of not FIRED.",

I got extra frosting and berry sauce-which I recommend doing, not because you will need them, but because the berry sauce is SOOO good and since I had some left over I used it on my waffles the next morning!   Delivery guy was nice and courteous and delivery for a Friday night wasn't too bad (I think about 30ish mins)",

I have ordered delivery every single time & picked up a pizza there, only once when they had a pick up special (which they do quite often).  The thin crust well done pizza (any kind) is always the best. While the topperstix are always chewy n gooey. The wings are pretty good too. Not breaded & full of juicy flavor.  If you are in one of the areas that Toppers delivers pick them over Pizza Hut, Papa Johns or Dominos. You will not be disappointed:)  I am no longer in an area that has a Toppers and it is just a crying shame  Boo Hoo",

    "text": "Lots of negative reviews here, and from what I'm gathering, a lot of it has to do with the location in the UNCC neighborhood. Well, I live by the one on South Blvd, and I have to say that Toppers is the best chain pizza around, at least TASTE wise. Being from Chicago, I am used to very flavorful pizza. I'm not hung up on the \"has to be like NYC pizza\" either, because I love all good pizza. But what makes Toppers a good pizza is the quality of their ingredients and the overall taste. Their sausage is VERY good, and their sweet marinara and cheese is also VERY good. This is the good part....  Now the bad. This is also the MOST expensive pizza in Charlotte! Their coupons mostly consist of free bread sticks and soda. I can give a flying $^!*#$@ about these things when I'm ordering PIZZA! Because my wife and I don't like the same things on our pizzas, we order 2 MEDIUM size pies each with about 3 or 4 toppings. With tax, delivery and tip, this typically runs about $43.00!!! For TWO medium pizzas. Yup, that's right.  Now compare that with Domino's, Papa John's, etc. Doing the math, I figure it's about 40% MORE in cost than Toppers. Is Toppers better than the others, Yes! Is it WORTH that much more.....well, that depends on your point of view and if you can afford $40+ pizzas. SOMETIMES I think it's worth it, sometimes I do NOT.  I actually complained about the price, and the South Blvd Store Manager gave me a coupon for a free Med Pizza with whatever toppings I wanted. That was nice, but the one pizza I paid for still cost me $23.00! For a MEDIUM with 3 toppings! THAT is pretty steep.  So if anyone from Toppers Management is reading what folks have to say, they really need to re-think their pricing and sales strategies. They have a good product, but their pricing is just too high for this market.",

    "text": "Hey...not bad!  Not bad at all!  Here in Charlotte NC on a business trip and the front desk of my Hyatt Plac suggested Toppers.  So I caved...and ordered online...a 12\" thin crust with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and black olives.  Came to $19.07 which included a delivery fee of $2.25 to the hotel.  Other than being luke warm when the delivery guy dropped it off at my hotel room, it was delicious.  Wonderful Chicago thin-crust style with plenty of toppings.  Great taste too.  No complaints whatsoever.  Nice job Toppers!",

    "text": "So I want to preface this review stating that this is heavily based on my customer service experience that I just had with this location.   I called to see about having a pizza delivered. I live 3 miles from the location. I get someone on the phone who couldn't focus on the call we were having, kept talking to other people, couldn't figure out where they deliver, and was actually kind of rude. I gave my address (which is a fairly new build) and he was like oh we don't deliver there. I mentioned I was less than 5 miles from them and asked for their delivery radius. He didn't know and said they delivered all around me but not me. My problem is that I have seen their delivery drivers here in my apartment complex NUMEROUS times!! So when looking on the map it shows that I'm not in their delivery radius, makes no sense but apparently I'm not. So what I don't understand is why they deliver here to some people and not others? Are they delivering to friends, or is this because they don't know what's going on in their own store?   Basically I'll give 2 stars because the pizza is actually decent but if I see your cars delivering to my neighbors and when I call you won't deliver to me yeah I'm going to give a bad review. Seems like really poor business management and customer service!! The other reviews I've read make me think this isn't a one time issue.",

It tasted like it had rotten thousand island dressing on it for sauce.

They don't have a dining room! We heard their specials and decided to go with a large one topping pizza and a order of topper stix for $15. We also got a specialty pizza for regular price. The guy at the register was really friendly and helpful. We got our pizza and topper stix and went on our way.   Large pizza was really good. Dough was good and not too crispy which I like. Sauce was good. Topper stix were cheesy and gooey. We got a thin crust pizza and the toppings on it were delicious!!   Perks-Any pizza comes with a side of sauce. There are lots of options to choose from! Not sure why but when we left, the cashier gave us a coupon to use next time for 50% off! Awesome deal!!",

It took us to visit charlotte in 2011 and actually try Toppers although we lived a few short miles (blocks rather) from the WORLD famous HeadQuarters in Wisconsin.   Anywhoo, this place made fans with the peanut gallery primarily due to the \"tall boy\" offering.   I personally think the \"hand pinched sausage\" \"thick cut pepperoni\" slices and real bacon via pieces make a world of difference. If you knew the college town that is Madison, Wisconsin - you'd understand why they have the variation of offerings as there's a lot of competition from ranch base, BBQ base, tator tot offerings, steak toppings and single slices sold NY style to deep dish Chicago style which brings me back to this location...  Service is solid and attentive. They have problems but quickly and politely address them.  They know their specials.  Online process makes things that much simpler and invoices are offered for record keeping or reimbursement efforts. This is useful when you have sorority or group functions and can be assessed at any time (4.5 years and rolling) if you set up an account.

I'm nearly convinced I should order another one for my flight tomorrow to SFO just to put be on cloud 9 knowing I have to deal with entitled travelers that create some of the most repulsive smells I've ever encountered. Really, it's unnatural. What I'm really trying to say is thank you. Thank you for the quick prep and bake. Thank you for the orgasmic pepperonis. Most of all thank you for making me happy.

I am 3 miles away. They have no real delivery area. When I asked what the area was they gave me some BS about it was like that before the store opened. While I waited on my pizza to be made, a driver left with a pizza bound for more than 5 miles away. This will be the last time I order here. Do yourself a favor and don't get food from here either.",

By the time I get home, it's midnight and I realize I'm starving and there's no food in the house. This last time it was closer to 2am before it occurred to me my stomach was trying to digest itself.   I'd like to thank Yelp for existing and letting me know who was open and serving food so late. And a huge huge thank you to Toppers for being open until 3am.   The staff were still super friendly at 3am on a Tuesday night. That's awesome, guys, truly. I already feel guilty I'm the reason you can't fully close up shop, and you're being so nice about it.   Pizza was great. For those of you who enjoy the Pizza Hut deep dish thing, Toppers is that and better. Ingredients are generous and taste really fresh. Prices are great, as well.  I usually do the New York slice thing, but when I'm craving something else, Toppers is for sure #2 on my list for pizza in Charlotte.",

We ordered from them the day before thanksgiving even though my wife, the charlotte native, had never even heard of them. We checked out their menu upon recommendation from a friend and decided to take a chance on their not so typical pizza menu. Man, was it worth it! I don't even remember what the other pizza was that we ordered but my wife HAD to have that Tater Tot pizza as soon as she saw it. I was skeptical, but once we took a bite, we were in Heaven. We took some home to my in-laws and they loved it as well. Imagine crispy tots baked on top of a pizza with creamy sauce as the base and creamy sauce, bubbly cheese and herbs on top! Yum! Also, the pizza was reasonably priced  and the order was quickly executed. Thank you Toppers, we will definitely be visiting again.",

It's been years since I've actually gone to the Queen City. No one wants McDonald's and we all get tired of cookout (but we love it haha). So when I looked up what was open late on the map, this place popped up. I had to drive a little further, but it was worth it. I walked in and Mike helped us. He had great customer service especially with this being my first time coming. He then explained the specials and I took a risk and got the buffalo chicken pizza. When I say, \"WOW\" .. I mean wow. LOL, if that makes sense. It was one of the best buffalo chicken pizzas that I have tried. The chicken and the sauces are a great combination. Then Mike suggested we try it with the chipotle ranch. life .. changing.   I wish we had Toppers in my area (Virginia Beach), but it is in limited cities around. Will def be back whenever I am in town and need a late night meal.",

Plus he ordered some sweet chili wings.  Delivery was quick! The delivery driver was very friendly and polite.  Man! That was some really good eating! The pizza was hot, which is a definite plus for delivery pizza, it was flavorful, not greasy and not doughy. The wings were tender and fell off the bone and flavorful.  We were so upset that we didn't discover them until tonight but super thankful that our last meal in Charlotte was a really good one.",
