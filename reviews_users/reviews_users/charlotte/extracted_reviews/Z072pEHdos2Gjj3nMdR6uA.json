If you like Italian food, this isn't authentic and the menu is quite limited, most of the items I have eaten aren't really \"italian\" or prepared in a traditional way. What is worse is the food is bland. I can just say the food is OK. For the price you should expect better food and will get better food at most white linen restaurants Uptown.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I visited Luce on our last evening in Charlotte, a Wednesday night in November.  We arrived at about 6PM without a reservation and were seated immediately.  The staff had no objection to our sitting for half an hour eating olives and sharing a single cocktail to pass some time before we ordered our main meal.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the olives are excellent.  So was the negroni.  The ambiance was authentically Italian (and we have been to Italy before): intimate, quiet, and comfortable.  A lot of this is due to the wait staff, who are all at least ethnically Italian, and in some cases rather adorably fresh-off-the-boat.  When we finally got around to ordering dinner off of their fall menu, we settled upon a meal with one main course and contorni to share.  My fiancee had (A) the spinach papardelle with oxtail ragu and I had (B) the risotto ai frutti di mare (a daily special).  To share, (1) cannellini beans with escarole and (2) spinach fried with garlic.  Upon the waitress's recommendation we also ordered one glass of Sangiovese to accompany the entire meal.  My fiancee is allergic to most dairy, and when she asked whether the ragu had any milk in it, the staff's immediate answer was \"Not that one,\" which really is the most reassuring answer that one can possibly get.  The food was, on the whole, marvelous:  (0) The first thing to arrive after we'd ordered was a cold cannellini bean salad with peppers, onions, and basil, served with bread.  Every table got this.  It made a great opener.  (A) The pasta was house-made.  Good, though we have had better - but that was in Italy.  The ragu was excellent, with the flavors of tomato, oxtail, wine, and carrot in good balance, and an amazing mouth feel.  (B) My seafood risotto had clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The key to seafood is freshness, and what went into my dish was certainly very fresh, with no off-flavors whatsoever.  For my part, I could also taste that they used very high quality cream.  The rice, unfortunately, was a bit grainy.  My guess is that they had one pot of it cooking continuously throughout the night, and that since we arrived early in the night, the risotto actually wasn't quite done.  Nevertheless, the flavors were so good and well-melded that I hardly minded.  (1) The cannellini with escarole was perhaps the one disappointment of the night.  The escarole was blanched first, so it lost its signature bitterness, which we both expected it to contribute to this dish.  (2) The spinach with garlic was 'a good straight line' as the two of us put it.  Is there a cuisine in the world which -doesn't- like spinach stir-fried with garlic?  We finished with coffee; our waiter commented upon our ordering coffee instead of desserts, \"yeah, that's how we do it in Italy.\"  I had black and she had espresso.  The espresso was very well made, and my coffee definitely benefited from (again) the very good cream.  Our whole meal ran us $85 including tax before tip, and included two drinks, two main courses, two side dishes, and two coffees.  We weren't billed for the tiny plates of olives we had during cocktails, so we left extra tip to match the staff's generosity.  Luce is the most authentic Italian dining experience we have had in the United States.",

Salads were very good.  Buttera was excellent with rally good italian sausage and crisp pancetta.  The only disappointing dish was the piccata which was so overwhelmingly lemon flavored that both te meat and the spinach were hard to taste.  Semi freddo was to die for.  Service was slower than anticipated based on other reviews.  I would call it average.  Overall a very good meal and evening.",

So I was excited to find this place, tucked away in the back of a little plaza.  The restaurant is small, with a lovely bar area and a warm decor.  The menu is well balanced and even has a vegetarian option.  They had some specials as well, including the avocado gaspachio which was delicious but served in a too big of a bowl.  Do try the bean dip that comes with the bread -- very tasty. Wine menu deserves a special note -- it's pretty diverse, lovely Tuscan selection with a lot of reasonably priced bottles that are still high quality.  The bill will come out a little bit more than average for the area but it's well worth it -- it manages to have class without extra pretense. I am going to be back.",

    "text": "We came here for restaurant week. Their 3 course meal menu had a wide variety for the occasion. Upon walking in, it wasn't what I thought it would be. It was smaller than what I imagined, but that was expected after looking at where it was located. Under the Hearst Tower.  Now, I imagine this place to be a local place to go to for office workers after a day at work and want to go to drink at a bar. For me, I think the only reason why I'm here is because its during restaurant week (and I thought the menu looked tasty, and I felt like eating italian.) On another note, the seats weren't extremely comfortable, but it was doable.  For appetizer, I ordered the fried calamari. It also had fried vegetables, except it was in a string form. My mother ordered the grilled octopus with capers sprinkled on top which I thought it was well cooked and tasty. My brother ordered a salad as an appetizer as well.  For the entree, I ordered the stuffed pork chop. I felt that even though there was sauce, it still tasted a little dry in my mouth. So to counteract I had to vigorously add sauce to my pork chop. Half way in was when I noticed stuffing because I tasted mushrooms and I was wondering where the hell is this from?! I thought it was a nice surprise.   My mother ordered the fish of the day which I thought was tasty. What made it was the lemon taste with the fish because of the olives as well as lemons themselves.   My father ordered off the restaurant week menu and got the Red Snapper. I thought it was very tasty. My brother thought it was very tender, mixed with the tomatoes it went well at the same time it kept with the Italian flavor. I and also my family enjoyed the hint of garlic on the fish.  My brother ordered the \"Osso Bucco\" which is veal. I thought it was delicious. The flavors of the veal as well as the sauce mixed really well. However, the risotto that came with it was mixed with cheese and we agreed that it wasn't cooked all the way through.  Lastly for dessert, I had the tiramisu and my mother had the vanilla custard. I felt as mine was tasty, but if I had to choose the dessert I think I would have gone with the custard.   Overall, Luce did a wonderful job and it's a wonderful placed to eat for those special occasions. The interior is a little small, but that could mean the experience could feel a little more intimate.",

The ricotta cheesecake was a hit as well.  I'll come back for the mare pasta alone.",

    "text": "I went to Luce last week with a friend of mine. Upon entering, the maitre d' asked if we would like our coats checked. I get cold quite easily and respectfully declined, he then went on to tell me that \"It's free\" with a \"you poor, stupid girl\" look in his eye. I was taken aback by this. I've dined in some of the finest and upscale restaurants in America and in Europe, it was quite a shock to me when he added that. I was then told to follow a server to my table. That server was on the other side of the room with no plans to come and properly show us to our table. As far as the food in concerned, it's ok. I really enjoyed the tartare I began my meal with. The lasagna? It looked like Stouffers. They have excellent drinks. I'd love to rate them higher but in the restaurant industry, service is just as important as the food, first impressions last. They way we were greeted was unacceptable.",

    "text": "This visit began with a shared calamari. Calamari was as good as ever but the hair strips of zucchini were a bit oily. Then, I got the beet salad because I love beet salad. Sadly, this was the low point of the meal. I actually added salt from the shaker. Pasta e fagioli tasted reheated but still tasty. Before the veal chops, I ordered their Garganelli, but it never came so I can't comment. The check did include the $22.95 for it, though. The chops were fine, but I was surprised not to be asked for a temperature. They came medium rare which is fine but it's nice to be asked.",

It is a trip to Italy without leaving Charlotte!   The big proof of authenticity is that is the lasagna: it has no ricotta cheese, the food is not overloaded with garlic. That's real Italian, not fake Italian places that you find everywhere. The espresso coffee is as good as you would get in Italy.",

    "text": "I went here last night for the first time to celebrate two friend's birthdays.  One of the birthday girl had told me it was one of, if not her favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  We went with a large group and started by having a drink at the bar.  We eventually made our way over to the large table that they had reserved for us.  Given the large size of the party, the staff was definitely very accommodating.  I'm pretty sure my friend who recommended the restaurant, has tried at least 50% of the menu over her visits there.    I chose the Scallops - \"Pan seared sea scallops, olive oil smashed potatoes, black truffle, prosciutto chips.\"  The scallops were some of the largest and best scallops I've ever had.  Everything about the dish was perfect.  The prosciutto chips literally melted in your mouth and I even shared one with the birthday girl.  My friend sitting on my other side, opted for a vegetarian dish, the Peperone - \"stuffed pepper, quinoa, vegetable risotto, roasted tomato coulis\".  It was delicious.    Everyone in the group left their plates looking like they had licked them clean.  My boyfriend had the lasagna, and when I asked him if he liked it (as I stared at the empty plate), he said \"Yeah, but it's not as good as yours.\" Someone was just being nice because I am not that good of a cook, trust me.    I would definitely return to Luce and as much as I loved the scallops, I know I would need to try out one of their other menu items.",

We sat on the patio for our 2nd visit & it's surrounded by potted plants, which gives a bit of a buffer, but still allowing for some people watching.  Our server was attentive and our food was (almost) as good as the 1st time.  I make the distinction because I had the \"mare\" both times.  It is a delicious dish, but a bit messy having to remove the lobster from the half shell (It's not the tail).  I asked this time if they could remove the shell for me, but felt that I didn't get even half as much meat as I would have if I had picked it myself.  Live & learn...still a delicious, fairly priced & convenient Italian experience in Uptown.",

I started out with the beef carpaccio appetizer and from there did the petite filet topped with a portabella mushroom.  The filet was so well cooked it seriously ranks in the top 5 that I've ever had.  Finished it all off with tiramisu that was fantastic as well.  The service was great, all be it a little hard to understand through the thick italian accents but very nice and polite all the same.  The decor is cozy and I would suggest eating at the bar as it's really nice in there and small enough to remain and feel intimate.  Parking is vailidated through the restuarant if you park at Hearst Tower.",

Everything on the menu sounded great, but I decided to go with the lobster risotto special. Delicious and rich - exactly what I wanted it to be. The rest of the table was pleased with their entree - a couple lasagna dishes and the pollo de parma.   The bruschetta was one of the better ones I've had.

We went a couple of weeks ago to talk about our trip to New Orleans during lunch- and surprise! Our waitress was from New Orleans. She was super sweet and helpful when filling us in on the top spots we had to see, and thanks to her we learned that the Endymion parade was THE THING to attend during Mardi Gras.  Back to the food. I had the risotto special which was extremely rich and full of seafood- scallops, shrimp, calamari... delish. It was definitely a little much for lunch, so I wasn't able to finish it. Nevertheless, I loved it. As I gazed around the restaurant I spotted nothing but men in suits- which I suppose is to be expected at an Uptown lunch spot. This brings me back to my original point- Luce is a good place for a refined business lunch. Great service and classic atmosphere.",

Calamari appetizer was mixed with shredded zucchini which hide the fact that there were probably a total of 8 pieces of calamari in total. Really for nearly $20?. Not kid friendly at all. No kid selections on menu. So we ordered a split spaghetti with meatballs for the kids (4 & 6 years old) which we were charged $29.00. Seriously? I will say wine selection and desserts were very good. But not enough for this Italian to bring his business again. I kind of feel like I was ripped off. I informed the asst. Manager of my disappointment so they did have a chance to address my issues but did nothing. From another business owner my advice would be to address these issues for future patrons. Italians are known for generosity and hospitality and Luce misses the mark on these traditions.",

I'm Italian and am very picky about the places I eat Italian food outside of my own house and can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  We made reservations because we had a larger party and I hate waiting.  Our table was waiting for us upon arrival and we were ushered to our seats in no time.  Manuel welcomed us warmly and proceeded to attend to us throughout the evening with ease.  Our service was impeccable.  I ordered the Mare.  Lobster, shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari over linguine with a light tomato sauce.  A lot of times when you get dishes like this the seafood is not fresh and there's not very much of it.  Totally the opposite at Luce.  Everything was prepared perfectly and there was plenty of seafood.  The tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect.  Manuel slid me an extra napkin to use as a bib which is appreciated since I already put my dry cleaners first born through college.  For dessert I had the semifreddo which was light, almondy and had hazelnuts on top.  Fresh berries accompanied this perfect dessert.  To top it all off, their Cafe Latte was made like I was in a sidewalk cafe on the streets of Verona.  Luce is one of the best for Italian in the Charlotte area.  I will be back and hope that you will too.",

    "text": "Good food? Check.  Good service? Check. Good atmosphere? Check.   I loved Luce! I stopped by for dinner last night and was thoroughly impressed with everything. I was greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and was seated right away. I dined alone but certainly did not feel that I was alone. The staff came by to check on me every once in a while to make sure that I was happy and enjoying my meal. They did not ignore me or give less than ideal service because I was by myself either. My server, was knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions and told me about the specials.    It was really hard to make a decision because everything on the menu sounded so delicious that I wanted a little of everything. I opted for only the spinach pappadelle pasta with oxtail ragu. I was not disappointed one bit. This was the first time I had pappadelle pasta and enjoyed it immensely. The restaurant makes their pasta in house and you can definitely tell. It was cooked perfectly and the oxtail ragu was nice and tender and they do not skimp on the dish. I ordered the smaller plate because I wanted to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did because I was getting quite full by the time I got to my third to last bite of the main entree.   For dessert I chose the creme brulee infused with rosemary. The combination sounded really odd but I decided to go for it. I love trying new things. The manager stated that if I did not enjoy it that they would switch it out for me. I had no regrets whatsoever.  I loved how the creme was soft and smooth and there was a touch of rosemary lightly caressing your tongue. My server said that they only put the rosemary in for a few seconds to infuse the creme and take it out. (I'm going to steal this idea the next time I make creme brulee.) The creme was not to sweet because it was balanced with the crunchy torched sugar on top. The strawberries, raspberry and blueberry topped off a perfect dessert. I ordered coffee to go with my dessert to cleanse my palate.   This is a home run for Luce in my book. I plan to visit every time I am  here in Charlotte for a business trip.",

    "text": "My husband had a taste for Italian, which is very rare so we searched Yelp & asked our hotel bartender for a help choosing a spot. We wanted something within walking distance, so Luce it was.   We called ahead for a reservation & were seated promptly when we arrived. Our server was professional and made recommendations when we asked about the wine. They had a long list & we were both very happy with our choosing.   We ordered the large cheese & olive plate as a starter & should have only chose the small. It was more than enough for us & very delicious. They also brought out warm soft bread with white beans in a garlic oil. I loved it, but my husband who hates onions wasn't a fan. He kept getting that flavor.   Choosing our main course was difficult because it all sounded amazing. I went with the Mare pasta that was loaded with seafood, served over linguine and a red sauce. The seafood was overflowing on my plate. Lobster, shrimp, mussels, & calamari. So good.  My dish would have been perfect had the sauce not been so incredibly salty. After I ate most of the seafood it was hard to eat the pasta. It almost burned my tongue it was so salty. My husband chose one of the specials of the evening which was super tender steak over a creamy red pasta sauce. His portion was rather small, but luckily he was pretty full by the time our entrees were served.   We enjoyed our evening, but I'm not sure if I would return if in the area.",

    "text": "I found an opportune moment to try this place when Charlotte's Restaurant Week rolled around again last summer. I have, and always will be a fan of fine Italian cuisine, so one could argue that I was biased from the moment I stepped in here. Nevertheless, it would seem that this small restaurant tucked away by the Bank of America building, certainly lives up to expectations.   The diner is spoiled for choice by the authentic menu items, though the choices are not overwhelming. Dishes are described in only three or four words which allude to traditional Italian ingredients and preparation. Then again \"potato gnocchi, tomato porcini mushroom sauce and parmigiano\" already sounds delicious.  Though we waited awhile to be seated, we were handsomely rewarded with free champagne, which kicked things off nicely. The grilled octopus or \"polipo\" was outstanding. Lightly chewy and savory with a nice grilled flavor. The scallops must have been sourced from another planet because they were each the size of small dinner plates. Perfectly browned coat with soft white flesh in the center. Veal Milanese was also quite good, though possibly a little tough. Awesome arugula + parmesan + balsamic garnish. For dessert we had the Semi-Freddo with almond nougat caramel sauce. Great finish.  I would definitely come back here again. My mind wasn't blown, but the food was pretty good and the restaurant's atmosphere felt a little more traditional than those of its contemporary Italian counterparts in the US. In uptown, this will be the closest you get to real gourmet Italian food that resembles anything like its motherland so let's make the most of it!!  4/5",

The calamari is very fresh and the lightly battered zucchini mandolin sticks that go with it are a great complement, and the two sauces are excellent. My wife had the sea bass on special and it was fresh and cooked perfectly. I had meat sauce based pasta and it was great. The pasta was cooked perfectly, a sign of a stellar chef.

We just go to the bar to get our drinks, it's so much faster than ordering them from the servers).  We had never been to Luce but had heard good things- and it lived up to our expectations!  This is hands down the best Italian restaurant we've been to in Charlotte.  We started with the Prosciutto e Mozzarella, which also had a little arugula salad with it.  The mozzarella literally melted in your mouth!  We split a bottle of Pinot Noir- I can't remember which one but our server recommended it.  For dinner my husband had the Buttera and I had the Mare.  Both were excellent, and we had enough leftover to take home for lunch the next day.  I would highly recommend Luce!",

The maitre'd was extremely cordial and checked on us several times.  They were out of the initial wine we ordered so they gave us a better wine for the same price.  Nice touch and start!  Then the food - they have this amazing white bean/olive oil dip for the bread....I know...doesn't sound that good but so tasty - i even tried to replicate it at home the following night.  We had the grilled octopus, branzino with artichokes and thinly sliced potato, and veal ravioli.  All were superb.  Then we were planning on going to Crave Desert Lounge nearby but they said the wanted to bring some sweets over....they brought two whole deserts and the semi-freddo with the honey was too die for.

I ordered the tagliolini, served with shrimp artichokes and a garlic, olive oil and wine sauce.  The dish had absolutely no flavor, used canned artichoke hearts, lacked any sign of garlic and definitely did not use EVOO.   The pasta was handmade and cooked perfectly al dente.  Unfortunately, the pasta was tough and the use of dried pasta would've been a better option.  My husband ordered the veal piccata.    The lemon sauce was flavorful but the veal was tough.  My recommendation, cook at home or go elsewhere.",

The food is delicious.  I've had the pesto, the gnocchi, arugula salad (has a light citrus dressing that's amazing) and the butternut squash ravioli (this was a special dish the night I went). As great as the food is the staff is even better.  Manuel is the manager and is so personable. He stops by the table to check on everything and chat a bit. You can tell he enjoys his job.  They are so attentive to details and friendly. They work hard to make your experience special. It's definitely a place to try when you are in uptown. It's right outside Hearst Tower. So it's very convenient to park there.",

In the group of about 9 people the majority ordered pasta - all of our pastas were entirely too salty, to the point where some couldn't eat it and sent it back. The bread was good, and most people said the other parts of their dishes tasted good.   The staff brought a manager and they provided a few deserts to help the issue. This might have been a one time occurrence, But I don't think I'll be going back when there are AMAZING spots to eat in Charlotte.",

We were really excited to go since we are both Italian food lovers, and the food by the way didn't disappoint us, but everything else did! First of all this is supposed to be a upscale restaurant and though it has a upscale feel, I can guarantee you that that's all it was a feel. They have a business casual dress code and I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to see full length tattoos last night but I did. I'm sure I wasn't supposed to see flip flops but I did, and the list goes on. Just because you dim the lights and put some white linens on the table doesn't make it upscale!!!!! Overall had a great time with my wife but I wouldn't recommend this place if your looking for UPSCALE!",

The kicker was the ravioli special ($25), which came with only two ravioli. It was supposed to have spinach, ricotta, and a runny egg yolk inside, but the egg yolk was firm. I couldn't say anything because no one ever asked how the meal was. The brown butter sauce was just butter--no brown flavor or flecks--and there was zero trace of the promised truffle flavor.  They seemed to know it wasn't right, and definitely didn't care. Not a fun experience dining out! Our waiter was more interested in the table next to us because they were ordering expensive drinks, and the manager took care of us half the time. We waited awhile for basic things and were really unimpressed. $50 for two plates of bad pasta down the drain.",

    "text": "We visited Luce this past Saturday evening for dinner.  I thought that Luce had taken over the old Coco Osteria space along Tryon St so when we arrived and it said Malabar, we were confused.  I quickly pulled out my phone to check the address.  The addresses matched.  Knowing that there is a courtyard right there, we decided to explore a bit further back.  That's when we noticed Luce tucked way back in the left corner right next to the Hearst Tower.  It's certainly not the most visible location for a restaurant.    We booked a reservation on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> and when we looked inside the windows and saw the crystal chandeliers and other decor, we had our doubts.  We thought maybe it was skewed to a much older crowd than us and we didn't want a \"stuffy\" experience, only a great meal.  After debating, we finally decided to go ahead with the reservation.  I'm so glad we did.    Our table wasn't quite ready yet when we checked in, but we were led to the bar area to sit and wait.  We were promptly greeted by the bartender at our high-top table and he offered us drinks.  I tried a red wine from Sicily I had never heard of before.  It was an excellent choice.  It wasn't too dry or bitter.  It was just right and I really enjoyed the BIG glassful that the bartender poured.  We sat and enjoyed our wines until our table was ready.    We were seated and promptly greeted by our server, Fabio.  Everyone with whom we came into contact was very friendly and seemed authentically Italian, as if English wasn't their first language at all.    All of the appetizer options sounded delicious, but we ventured with the imported italian FORMAGGI (cheeses) with marinated olives.  We ordered the larger version of the appetizer (they have small and large versions for about half of the items -- appetizers and entrees -- on their menu).  We received a cupful of green olives and four triangle slices each of five different cheeses, along with some crisp bread slices.  It was definitely more than enough for two to share.  The harder cheeses had more flavor than the softer ones.   We were also brought fresh slices of bread and a bowl of a whole cannellini beans mixed with olive oil and other flavorful ingredients complimentary for each table.  It was so simple, yet so delicious.    Next came the entrees.  I didn't want anything with red sauce, so I opted for something new:  AGNOLOTTI.  Agnolotti apparently is \"ravioli.\"  In each ravioli was roasted veal and swiss chard, and then covered in a brown \"butter, sage, and jus de veau sauce.\"   It was freakin' AMAZING.  And that wasn't just the effect of the delicious red wine.  My partner tried the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was very rich and creamy, covered in a white sauce.    Unfortunately, after all that bread, beans, cheese, and pasta, we did not have room for dessert.  The cannolis were very tempting, though.  For a final good, lasting impression, our server brought us complimentary shots of deliciously sweet limoncello.    Upon leaving, we were thanked and told goodbye by several of the waitstaff, as if we were family.  It was a fantastic, authentically Italian experience, and I look forward to returning soon!    p.s. When our reservation was confirmed on OpenTable, it said that if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage, you get two free hours of parking with a validated ticket from Luce during lunchtime hours, or \"free\" with validated ticket on evenings and weekends.  We took this to mean that you could park for more than two hours for free, but when we got our validated ticket, it was marked as \"two hours.\"  Unsure with the conflicting information, we left and found free parking elsewhere to walk around Uptown.  So...I really don't know what the correct parking situation is there.  But at least two hours is free!",

We started with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus as an appetizer and I could've eaten 10 orders. (It only comes with 4 pieces so order two orders). The asparagus was cooked perfectly and the prosciutto de Parma was outstanding.   For the entrees I had the gnocchi, which was the best I've ever tasted. Homemade and delicious. My wife had the Mare and there was so much food but the key was that it was all cooked perfectly. She was in heaven.

It was so hard choosing a place to go because the list of options is great and the menus are tempting but since I LOVE Italian food my husband and I decided to go with Luce. It has been almost forever since I've been looking for some authentic risotto and when I saw risotto on their Restaurant Week menu I knew this was the place I was going for! We had reservations at 6:30, we got there 10 minutes later since the traffic was insane uptown. When we got there the host cAme straight to us, asked if we had a reservation and took us to our table. They brought us water and a rose champagne (no cost) which I thought was wonderful and a basket with delicious different kinds of bread and a vinaigrette.  The waiter gave us some time to look at their menu, they definitely have some interesting options but we decided to go with the Queen's Feast menu since that was the main reason we were there. I had fried ravioli stuffed with beef and a balsamic reduction dressing that was delicious. My husband had arugula salad with oranges and crab cakes that was also delicious. Of course that I had to go with their risotto, lobster, calamari, shrimp, clams and mussels. That was the best and most authentic risotto that I've ever had in this country! I confess that I wasn't expecting much about the risotto but it was love at first bite.  My husband had pasta with beef ragu, meat balls, veal and short ribs. Oh my, oh my! Soooo good! For dessert I decided to go with the Pana Cotta, even though I am not a big fan of that kind of dessert but decided to give it a try and again, the dessert was awesome as everything in that place.  My husband ordered a gelato but forgot to ask the flavor when they brought it to him he realized it was coconut and he does not like coconut so I offered to switch with him since the gelato was good too.  All that being said I can't wait to go back to try more of their delicious, authentic, Italian food! The service there is great! They are a little bit pricey but for the food, the service, the atmosphere and the whole experience they are more than worth it!",

    "text": "My wife and I decided on Luce for the Queen's Feast (Charlotte restaurant week) because it is a great opportunity to try out a new venue. We were very pleased with our overall experience from start to finish. While it is always difficult to create an \"old world vibe\" with newer construction, the decor and ambiance at Luce was very nice and definitely has a  classy Italian feel to it.  When we first walked in, we were quickly greeted by the host and given a choice between two open tables. The menu offerings for restaurant week were spot on with something for everyone. My wife had a crab cake appetizer and seafood risotto for her entree and she raved non-stop about both! I had the fried ravioli appetizer and fusilli with a meat ragu sauce for my entree - both were excellent without being too heavy. We both finished off dinner with a square of tiramisu - an Italian staple. Wine by the bottle was a little pricey but excellent quality - my wife loved the Tuscan red blend the waiter helped us pick out. Portions are slightly on the smaller side - typical for upscale dining - but the quality and flavor were amazing and the portions wound up being just right for us to finish without feeling overly full.  Service was excellent - the wait staff was attentive without being intrusive. Our wine and water glasses never got too depleted before someone came by and topped us off   Our only suggestion for improvement is that the owner needs to play some better music in this establishment - all the other components for great ambiance are there but the music choices were a bit bizarre at times. Even the waiter said the rest of the staff is working on the owner to get him to change   We both agreed Luce was the best restaurant experience we have ever had for restaurant week and we like Luce so much we have to go back again soon!",

    "text": "We walked in for lunch midweek without reservations.  They seated us immediately.  The menu was limited with clearly marked specials.  This was important as one in the party had severe food allergies--not the normal ones, either.  We could actually see all of the ingredients in each of the pastas available for order.    We had some kind of appetizer with cooked tomatoes and toast.  Not my favorite.  I don't like toast and I don't like cooked tomatoes.  So this may well be more of a reflection of me than of the dish.  But it just didn't taste fresh to me.  On the other hand, all of the entrees tasted fresh.  This is important in a pasta dish.  Once you've had good fresh pasta, you never go back to non-fresh (except when you're lazy and making it yourself).  Bad fresh pasta is better than dried pasta.  Sadly.  I had this amazing ravioli.  But there were only seven pillows.  And not enough shredded basil.  It was delicious.  But I had to partition out the basil so that each half-pillow had two squiggles and I wouldn't run out before I was done.  I prefer not to have to worry/think about that aspect of eating.  Another in the party had the lasagna on special.  It was a pretty serious tower.  You could see the layers from the side, nicely delineated.  One person had the salad.  It had salami on it.  They enjoyed it, but I definitely would not have.  Again, I think this is a question of taste.  So really consider that when thinking about whether or not to come here for lunch versus for dinner.  Aside from the menu variety--where I do still have to say I liked my ravioli and there was at least one other option I would have enjoyed as well--my only other complaint was the speed.  Given that it was a lunch and we were all in suits, I think having a little more rapidity of taking the order, refilling drinks, bringing the check would have been nice.  But I can't tell if they just weren't anticipating or if this is how they show respect by trying not to rush us.  Would I do it again?  Yes, but for dinner and not lunch.",

I wanted to place a to go order after researching the menu, and his demeanor and distasteful responses to me just left a bad taste in my mouth. I said very straightforward I'd like to place a to go order and to have off the parmigiana as I'm lactose intolerant, and his response was so belittling and rude I actually said never mind. He seemed happy that I didn't want to order food. My money was not welcomed here.  Perhaps the way I was dressed in a tee and jeans was not up to par, but I cannot understand why you would treat me so rude after trying to place a to go order from a restaurant with only a few tables occupied during the prime time of dinner.  Bad customer service is worse than bland food. I'd suggest this server to take a course in customer service. Unfortunate because i really wanted to try the tiramisu.",

I'm happy to report it can be found at Luce!  This cozy little treasure is tucked away like a hidden gem!   Wonderful and attentive service, for starters.  A great wine selection and tasty cocktails are an added bonus.    I had the bruschetta, served as bruschetta should be and bursting with flavor.  For my main course I tried the Garganelle; have you ever had hand rolled penne pasta?! Who lovingly rolled all those little beauties so that I could stuff them in my cheeks?  I only wish we had time to stay for dessert, but we were late for the show.  Next time we'll leave ourselves more time!  I highly recommend adding Luce to your list of \"must do\"!",

    "text": "I went for a nice corporate dinner; with my co-workers and myself include to this Italian restaurant. We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good.   Bruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano, and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.  Calamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better-fried calamari in other restaurants this one was no that good.   Asparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it.   For my main course, I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for a recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it.   Mare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk.   The service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection. But like I say the Mare saved the day.",

We shared a couple of apps - calamari and bruschetta, plus there is a cannellini and oil based dip for bread to share as well.  I wasn't responsible for selecting wine, but we had a couple bottles of a delicious red and they had a decent selection to choose from.  I ordered the gnocchi.  Love fresh pasta and gnocchi is one of the pastas I haven't quite mastered at home, so I enjoy having it when it's done well and freshly made in house.  The sauce was flavorful without being overbearing, and of course a dash of freshly grated parmesan to top it off.    Others at the table had the chicken, tagliatelle, lasagne and salmon.  I tried a couple brussel sprouts.  A bite with some bacon was perfect.  We split the tiramisu which is one of my favorite Italian desserts and loved it.  Overall had a great experience at Luce for a nicer dinner.  The restaurant itself is on the small side and we did have to wait a bit for our table, but it was understandable given it was a busy holiday evening.  We occupied ourselves at the bar with a round of cocktails, beer and prosecco.",

We have a baby so we would have preferred to just walk. Anyway! Gorgeous quaint little restaurant. We had a reservation but were seated right away and we chose outside because of the wonderful weather. Definitely had the prosecco. The beans served with the bread basket was right up my ally. We started with the buratta which was sooooo creamy on top of country bread with pomodoro. We also had the roasted asparagus with Parmesan and prosciutto. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and paired with the prosciutto it was a perfect combination. For dinner, i had the Mare. It was housemade linguini served with pretty much every fish imaginable. Lobster, clams, muscles, scallop, calamari etc. I couldn't stop eating. My boyfriend had the Buttera. A tubular pasta similar to rigatoni with sausage and peas in a creamy tomato sauce. It was so delicious I really can't put to words. Their pasta is all made their. You can taste the quality. It is cooked to a perfect al dente. For dessert we had a panna cotta that was sublime with the perfect bounce and creaminess. Served with fresh berries. We got cannolis to go. Please go here. I'm 100% Italian and it took me right back to my time spent there.",

The only complaint I have regarding service is that they gave us so much time between each visit to the table, the dinner lasted a full 3 hours.  We were hungry and would loved to have gotten our meals sooner!  But I also appreciate that we were given privacy to enjoy each course.    The portions are adequate but on the small side compared to other restaurants, which is typical for a high end restaurant.  The food itself was delicious.  We tried the CAPRESE SALAD, which contained two slices of tomato and two slices of mozzarella with a bit of basil and balsamic.  The tomatoes were of excellent quality.  I was happy that there was bread on the table to bulk up the appetizer a bit.  We also ordered the PROSCIUTTO and ASPARAGUS, which contained high quality ingredients and was well seasoned.      One of the evening specials was a BRANZINO with SEA BASS.  My coworker enjoyed this dish, but it looked a little messy as the fish was thin and flaking all over the plate.  Another coworker ordered the GNOCCHI and said it was excellent.  I had the RAVIOLI, which consisted of fresh house made pasta filled with mozzarella and ricotta in a delicate tomato sauce.  It was just enough to satisfy my hunger, but this would not be enough for a hungry or heavy eater.  The fresh pasta was unexpected but wonderful.    We asked for wine suggestions, and ended up with a full bodied red from BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO that was still light and had no sharpness.  I'm not a fan of red wine, but even I enjoyed this one.   We had 3 entrees, 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine for $235 + tip.",

Worth a visit if you're looking for upscale dining with authentic italian dishes.",

    "text": "I had lunch at Ristorante Luce with an account manager of the consulting company I work for here in Charlotte (free lunches are great!).  This place is fantastic! We started off with insalata I had the organic greens, my acct mgr had the Caesar.  Both were fresh and lightly dressed.  For our entrees I had the gnocchi and my acct mgr had the piccata.  The gnocchi were the best.  They were cooked al dente with a light tomato sauce covered with mozzarella.  My acct mgr said the piccata was excellent as well, which I believe as she used the bread to mop up the remaining lemon caper sauce.  I had the gelato for dessert.  The day's flavor was coconut.  It was also delicious.  The service was perfect.  Attentive without being intrusive.  I have traveled to Italy and this ristorante compares with anything I found there.  One note, this Ristorante follows the same menu structure as in Italy.  Everything is ala carte.  So if you order antipasto or insalata, an entree, and dolce you can rack up a big bill.  But, nothing on the lunch menu was over $14, so you can have reasonably priced lunch as well.  The portion size is also Italian as well, no over flowing plates here, but that is how I wish more restaurants would do.  Overall the food is simple and well prepared.  I will definitely make it a point to come back for dinner in the future.  If you want True, simple, excellent Italian food, Ristorante Luce will deliver.",

    "text": "WOW! We had clients coming in from New York City and knew they wanted Italian food so I got on Yelp and found Luce. I had never been to Luce so was a little nervous to make a reservation for 10 people without any prior experience, but thought you really couldn't go wrong with Italian right? Oh Luce knows how to do it!   A couple of us arrived and went to the bar before the rest of our guests arrived. The bartender was extremely attentive and gave us complimentary house chips to snack on. They have a nice wine list and are very happy to help you select an option that matches your palette.   Once we were seated we were greeted with still/sparkling water, along with a bread basket. For starters we ordered a cheese/charcuterie board, the calamari and bruschetta. The calamari was tasty, but I really enjoyed the bruschetta. The tomatoes were very fresh.  Mostly everyone started with a salad and I opted for the arugula salad. I must say if you do NOT like lemon do NOT order this salad. The lemon vinaigrette was killer on the lemon. It made it very acidic, but I think that's what also makes it authentic? Anyways, sticking with a Caesar next time :-) Plus- if this was the worst of the night I'll take it!  For our meals we all got a variety. I opted for the mare seafood pasta. OH MY! It was loaded with seafood: lobster (huge), mussels, clams, scallops (delicious!) and calamari. It was over a linguine alfredo and it was so amazing! One of the best pastas I've ever had. Another person got the Veal Chop and the Agnolotti (veal pasta), and they equally looked amazing. I would highly recommend a pasta dish here over anything - another coworker got the salmon and it didn't stand a chance next to the other meals.   To finish we got an array of desserts. The top contenders were the ricotta cheesecake and tiramisu. Unfortunately they were out of the creme brulee, but I will come back for that!    And to top the night off we all had two rounds of lemonchello. Let's say the meal was so amazing, but the lemonchello really gave this review a 5 star.  And I can't forget about the staff. Our server was awesome. He was very attentive and everything was served in a timely matter.  All in all I will return to Luce and it will be on my list for Restaurant week as well!",

But make no mistake, she's a winner. Sincere and attentive service, and food that hits all the marks. Fresh seafood, perfectly al dente pasta, and everything perfectly seasoned (a rarity these days). I had the same entree on both my visits (Pasta Mare) because it was AWESOME, but I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu in the near future!   Definitely adding this to place to my regular rotation!",

The tagliatelle bolognese was dry--I would've preferred more sauce, but the portions were good. I really enjoyed the warm bread with the white beans in olive oil. The arugula side was also a great salad appetizer size, but the calamari was disappointing. There were only a few pieces of calamari and most of it was fried zucchini.  The ice cream was also sad. It tasted good, but $8.50 for one scoop of ice cream is a bit much. Most restaurants I've been to give two scoops for the same price.",

The Bronzino was out of this world delicious, and their Tiramisu & Cheesecake were phenomenal.   However we went 20 minutes at a time without ever seeing the waitress - drinks remained empty, and the food timing was incredibly off - for such a pricy restaurant, I expected much better. One of us was completely finished his desert at least 5 minutes before the other deserts even made it to the table.   Anyways - good food. Not worth the price & the service was disgraceful considering how expensive our bill was.",

We arrived at 6 and were a bit worried about how sparsely populated the restaurant was, but it filled up and became a lively place by 8 o'clock.  Some of the wait staff had difficulty with English, which made ordering certain drinks difficult.  But they were all friendly and obviously trying hard.  The food was amazing.  I especially enjoyed the burrata appetizer, and the osso bucco.  My dining companions all seemed to enjoy their entrees, especially the branzini.  For dessert I ordered a Semi Freddo (frozen custard), which was OK but not memorable.  My companions really enjoyed the chocolate mouse cake/torte.  I did not try any pasta, but the gnocci got rave reviews from my companion.  I would enjoy returning.",

Always superb service and food quality.  Tonight we celebrated Lori's birthday.  They greeted us with a complimentary flute of Prosecco.  Nice.  Great start.  Lori ordered Polipo (grilled octopus and potato--their riff on Spanish Octopus Galatia): the olives and pine nuts brought the dish back home to Italy.  Sublime.  For my appetizer beef carpaccio with arugula and parmesan reggiano shavings.  Elegant.  The star entree was the Mare although Lori's grilled halibut was expertly prepared.  Really no losers.  The chef prepared the dish in such a manner that all the seafood was perfect.  No small task when cooking lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, and squid served on a bed of linguine.  And the sauce: silky, buttery, with some back heat.  I got the evil eye when my wife thought I was about to lick the plate.  Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.  What else can I say?  Looking to lay down some change and get it back with style, class, service, and flavor?  Luce's.  Uptown.  I say Give 'em a Whirl!",

The dinner (some kind of fish) was salty. To make matter worse... I found a long blond hair in my fish. The waiter comp my meal out.

We made a reservation beforehand through Yelp so we really did not have any contact with the restaurant prior to our trip. However, when we got to the hotel, Luce was in one of the dinning books from the Charlotte area. We have to say they were short in describing this wonderful place. We had to call to change our reservation because we miscalculated a little our time and I was very impressed by their willingness to accommodate us. I even told my husband that they must not be that busy. Well I was wrong. They were busy but this did not stop them from delivering one the best dinning and customer service experiences we have seen in years. I called again to move my reservation one more time and was even more impressed when the person over the phone said to let them know when I would like to go and they would have a table for me. And they did. The place was full but we did not wait a minute. We were greeted right away and our waiter was with us in an instant. The place is gorgeous with a chandelier that I wanted to bring home. The food amazing and the service impeccable. The manager even walked us out and talked to us outside for a little. We definitely would like to see someplace like this in Miami. My husband ordered the osso buco and it was delicious. I ordered the eggplant pasta and my husband finished what I could not eat. They had a large selection of bod red and white wine. I can't remember if we ate dessert. But to me the best dessert was their magnificent hospitality and service. I want to go back!!!!",

    "text": "Italian cuisine that transcends the ordinary, with impeccable service and an ambiance that demands romance make for a great dining experience, especially with your someone special.  The Mrs. and I strolled in on a Friday night at the start of restaurant week.  Thankfully, \"rush\" is not a concept here and, even from our initial greeting and coat check with the hostess, we were pampered  throughout the evening.    The dining room is low lit in the evening, but not dark.  Plaster walls, travertine floors and mostly small tables along the walls.  A small bar sits off to the side, but seemed filled with regulars before the evening's end.  I'll agree with others- this is a place for date night, not a corporate function.   Wine list is ample and will cover most palates.  A drink menu holds a small selection of cocktail options.  While you peruse the menu, there is fresh-made bread with a white Italian whole-bean dip that we eventually had to push away lest we spoiled our appetites for the entrees to come.     The menu seems to change but you really should listen to the specials of the evening- there is usually a fish of the day and a risotto and pasta of the day that all sounded worthy on our evening.  Our waitress took her time and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu.  While there are a few Italian staples here, like lasagna, there is a noticeable effort to focus on more Tuscan-style offerings that play on fresh vegetables and proteins light on sauce but skillfully chosen to complement the other ingredients.  On our night, I had pistachio-crusted Salmon alongside a risotto flavored with citrus and cardamom.  It was wonderful.  Salmon was cooked to order and light, while the risotto was rich and savory.  The Mrs. had a veal and risotto dish that was accented with truffle and was equally amazing.  While we ate, it seemed all the staff stopped by to ask if we were enjoying our meal and whether we needed anything else.  Glasses never got close to empty and I got the feeling that our disapproval of anything would have resulted in immediate rectification.  In other words, the team-based service approach was seriously spot-on here.  The Italian accents by most staff were a pleasant surprise as well.  Pacing was appropriate and we were comfortable the entire time.    Dessert menu was small, but what we picked out worked very well.  Chocolate lava cake and a pear tarte were both single-sized portions, but just enough to savor and cap off what had already been an exceptional meal.    Bill was promptly delivered but we were never rushed.  Parking validation at the table was nice.  Even upon leaving it seems the floor staff made a point to wish us a good evening.  When the hostess refused our tip for the coat check, it just sealed the deal that these guys take customer serious seriously.  Refreshing.    Luce not only has some excellence in their kitchen, but it flows out to the floor staff as well.  This was a great choice and is a worthy contender for a romantic night out with one's significant other.",

    "text": "Oowee. This is some seriously great Italian. If you like your meals to take time, then this place is five stars. The food is five stars. But the slooooow service drops it a notch.  Our server didn't have an extensive knowledge of the beer list. This probably shows my naivete with regard to what you're supposed to order at a restaurant like Luce, but still, a good server knows EVERYTHING, or at least acts like it. Thus, Peroni. [sigh]  My appetizer was the veal cutlets, just little thin slices of tender baby calf with a dallop of sauce and capers. I'm going to spend a few more months in Purgatory for eating veal, but MAN, it will be worth it!  My main course was the cheese rolled in pork, the Fraciti I believe it was called (I can't seem to pull up the menu online) with gnocchi. Seriously great stuff. I ended with the custard and berries, which was okay. I wouldn't send it away, but perhaps I was expecting something more after the faaaaaantastic appetizer and entree.  Whew. Again, the only drawback was the 2.5 hour meal. An entire tenth of my day was spent at this restaurant. In some sense it was worth it, just be prepared. Go GO GO!",

I liked that they didn't want the guest to have to lift a finger save feeding yourself! I will definitely be back and would like to commend every person working this past tuesday night for the excellent service. I was really impressed and have told anyone who will listen about how great you guys were. Each person working went out of their way to ensure we were having the best experience possible and it worked. Thank you for making our date night a night to remember!",

Dinner begins with homemade breadsticks and a breadbasket with a delicious olive oil chickpea mixture for dipping. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer, which was delicious. I got the Spinach and Ricotta ravioli for my entree, and I thought it was comparable to a pasta entree at an Italian restaurant in NYC. Really, really fantastic.  But really what caused me to take the time to write was the service. The maitre d checked on us throughout our meal and really found that balance between feeling like you're getting taken care of but not having your meal interrupted. Our waiter was incredible--professional, friendly and warm.   The atmosphere is classy, with high ceilings and muted colors. It feels a bit glamorous, but the service is very down to earth. I would recommend this to anyone in Charlotte...it has to be the best Italian restaurant in the city!",

Everything was great - food, service, etc.  We don't eat out often at nice places anymore, so it was a relief to have a good experience that was worth the money.  We tried the lobster bisque,homemade ravioli (I ordered the plain cheese, old-school version because I knew it would be good), osso buco (my husband always orders this if it's on a menu), and Chilean seabass (this used to be my go-to dish but since it's now overfished and politically incorrect I try to abstain).  Accompanying risotto was good.  My only complaint was that there were no veggies on the plates (although you could order spinach as a separate side).  Maybe restaurants have moved away from this because people don't eat them and they go to waste.  I highly recommend Luce for an excellent pre-show dinner.",

    "text": "Overall, Luce is one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  Delicious food (the gnocchi was amazing), excellent wait staff, wonderful atmosphere.  If I was a \"playa\", I'd take my date here for the sure win in the restaurant category.  We were in town for the Charlotte Heroes Comic Con and stopped here for dinner.   When we walked in, I immediately felt under dressed.  Even though every other customer was in fully casual attire (more likely due to the nearby comic event), the restaurant immediately strikes you as an upscale, formal attire venue.  The decorating is simple, yet beautiful, with large white columns, soft romantic lighting and a big brass chandelier over the main dining area.     Every single course was interesting, beautiful and delicious.  A bread basket with a variety of bread was brought with a small bowl of oil and cannelloni beans.  The bread as a bit on the hard side on the outside, but still very tasty and just filling enough to curb your appetite.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which comes with fried calamari, topped with shredded and fried zucchini, with two different sauces for dipping.  We were both surprised by the shredded zucchini, but it was delicious and an excellent addition the crispy yet soft calamari.  For entrees I ordered the gnocchi, and my gf ordered the pesto.  They were both delicious.  The pesto had lots of flavor, with the pasta being soft and tender.  It was great.  Here's the thing though.  The gnocchi was so good, it almost ruined the pesto.   I've had a lot of Italian food, and tried gnocchi a few times.  Each time I've tried gnocchi, it's been prepared al-dente which imo has made it too much on the chewy side.  This gnocchi was soft.  Not mushy, but soft and the texture combined with the large chunks of fresh mozzarella  was wonderful.  The tomato based sauce it was in, was easily some of the best I'd ever had.  The flavor wasn't complex.  It was just the best of the flavors in tomato sauce, amplified.   It was not only the best gnocchi we'd ever had, it was one of the best Italian-style dishes I'd ever eaten.  For dessert we ordered the Semi-freddo.  It's a small sweet bit of ice cream with some sort of yummy nougat inside, with a few assorted fresh berries on the side.  It was tasty, and the flavors of the ice-cream and fresh berries mixed perfectly.  The restaurant isn't very large, but that only adds to charm and intimacy of the atmosphere.  The hostess was professional, and personable and sat us at a table out of the way.  Our waiter was polite and friendly (but not too friendly.  You know what I mean.).  It's important to note, that the entire wait staff was sharp, clean and well dressed.  None of that half-assed, \"I'm abiding by the dress code, but I really just rolled out of bed\" look.  I'm ok with that most times, but the wait staff of the night obviously put some effort into looking crisp, and it added to the high class feel of the place.    In addition to looking and behaving posh and professional, the wait staff also managed to always be near enough to get you something if you needed it, but rarely so intrusive that they were a bother.  The small size of the restaurant and the number of staff hit the perfect balance of availability and perceived absence.  We never felt annoyed at their presence or lack thereof.  As for the price, well,  \"If you ain't got no 'monay, take yo broke ass home.\"  (or to another, more fiscally friendly venue, whichever)",

Upon arrival, our table wasn't quiet ready.  No problem there, because the suggestion to \"grab a drink at the bar\" was a given.  Tucked away in the corner, the attentive bar-goddess quickly poured us wine and presented us with nibbles.  Super-crunchy potato chips (which appeared to be made in house), as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us.    These. Olives.    I wanted to fall asleep in a bowl of these olives.  I don't know what kind of magic the cooks/aka/olive-wizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them (fresh garlic? fresh rosemary? tears of their first born?), but I'm talking LIFE CHANGING. Like little baby angels.    The food was great, service attentive and friendly. I'll definitely be back....for the olives.",

Well here is the good the service was great - the atmosphere was great - the dessert (tirimisu) pretty delicious, but everything else just fell short.  I ordered a dirty martini (received a straight-up martini with a twist of lemon)  the boyfriend ordered a long island iced tea (we all tried to figure out what kind of drink they actually made him tasted like bourbon)  but I could live with the drink mishap I'm happy I had my vodka.   Now for the food... I started with the panzanella salad there wasn't much taste in the dish it was under seasoned just plain. I  ordered the manicotti for my dinner - I wish I would have known before I took a bite how hot this dish was I could barely feel my tongue after that.  The manicotti was ok but not memorable.  The dish that not only looked really disappointing but as I was told by my guests I brought along with me it was tasteless too.  I'm not going to lie their chicken dishes looked like a lean cuisine you know those teeny tiny chicken breasts that come in lean cuisine meals well folks that is exactly what they got.  Although that was a sad dish the pork chop my boyfriend ordered was delicious and the veal shank was quite tasty as well.  Will I be back ...hmm not sure yet.",

The dish was heavily salted. I could not taste anything else. The sausage and tiny short rib (1) was very dry. They tasted like they were on the steam table for days. $32 and there were only about 5 bites of sausage in the dish. I never leave food on the plate but even with these meager portions I still did not finish. Johnsonville brats cut up with home cooked pasta and marinara from a jar would have been much better!!!  My wife had the shrimp. They were impressive. 4-5 bites each. They were tasty but almost overcooked. The risotto was also very dry, not creamy. It tasted as though it was under the heat lamp for an hr. It was my wifes birthday and I did not want to complain on her special day. They did give us a small ice cream desert on the house.

(The waiter even asked to what temperature I'd like it cooked! Joy!) Dessert was mediocre Italian-American restaurant fare. I would just as soon have skipped it. Portions are very decent and I thought the warm crusty bread was delicious; I asked for butter on the side as I didn't care for the bland, oily, ice cold white bean salad the waiter at first brought with the bread.

Every meal starts with fresh bread and a bowl of cannelini beans in olive oil. Yum!  A sister to the nearby Coco Osteria, Luce has a larger dining room and is more elegant.

The thing that turned me off from this restaurant was the service. It's not that they weren't attentive, but when asked to tell me about the menu, they were almost condescending... \"what do you want to know about it.\" Most places I've been that have restaurant week go over their menu, tell you their favorites or recommendations, etc. Not this place. I won't be back again, the food wasn't good enough to entice me.",

    "text": "We had tickets to see Michael Buble downtown and wanted to head into a nice restaurant before the show. We read good things on Yelp about Luce so we headed there and found that it was very busy and reservations are generally recommended.   They were still very accommodating and allowed us to sit outside on the patio with minimal wait, which was our preference that night because it was warm outside, but the inside is very nice and next time we go, we will make the proper reservations to enjoy that ambiance.   The food was great, the calamari was some of the best I have had in Charlotte. For entrees, I got the Butterra and my wife got the Farcito and we were both eating off each others plates. I added a picture so you can see the portion size and presentation. We both drank Stella so not sure how their wine was, but overall it was a great place for a date night, and we enjoyed the service and outside seating area.",

    "text": "Recently, I had a business lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Luce is a small restaurant that sits at the foot of the Hearst tower.  If you are not paying attention, it is possible that you might miss it; even if you are looking for it.  I have worked uptown for a while now and did not know it was even there until someone took me there.  In fact, when we were walking to Luce's I thought that maybe the people I was dining with meant Lavecchia's.  Regardless, once I got there, I was impressed with the atmosphere.  It was small and well appointed.  I think this would be a good place for future business lunches or dinner.  A date might be nice here as well.  The dining room is dimly lit but not too dark and I swear all of the waiters are fresh imports from Italy. All are very attentive and have a strong Italian accent.  While you wait for your meal, you are presented with fresh bread and olive oil with beans and some sort of spice, a  bruschetta of sorts, to munch on.  For lunch I had a pasta dish made of spinach pasta and a heavy cream sauce - an alfreto of sorts with prosciutto.  The flavors were amazing.  The dish had a certain richness to it but was very light.  Although I have not been to Italy before, I would suspect this to be very authentic.  I was impressed by my experience at Luce's and look forward to returning again soon.",

The food was great - upscale Italian. We started with their cheese plate - great selections with delicious crusty bread.   For dinner, I had the scallops - they were cooked perfectly and was a nice portion size. My dining companion had the pesto gnocchi - delicious!   Service was very attentive and friendly.   Definitely a good dining choice for Charlotte.",

    "text": "Sauce by Chef Boyardee. And that is NOT a compliment. The evening started okay. We did not have reservations, but we were early enough and they found a spot for us. The service was impeccable which is why this restaurant has been given 2 stars instead of none.   We started with champagne. We did not want a full bottle as we were headed to the theater.   The house brand was on the sweet side but okay. Then they brought out the stale bread with the good white beans and olive mixture. The bean stuff was okay but it didn't make up for the lackluster dry bread. I expect so much more from a good Italian. Then we ordered the cheese plate and a sausage plate.   We only raved about one cheese. All of the hard salami choices were good, but it is hard to mess-up that.   Then came the worst main courses ever!  We ordered the pasta because we had heard such great reviews. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the ravioli. The pasta itself was good, but the sauce ruined everything. We can only describe the sauce as a thin tasteless substance with a hint of the flavor that comes out of a can of Chef Boyardee. I only ate bit of this gruel. We called for the check.  The staff did offer to bring us something else, but we were done. We paid the bill in full and left. We were so disappointed.",

    "text": "This clearly is a Romantic Restaurant, at least for Dinner. It is a relatively small space in the Hearst Tower, but it is dimly lit and the wait staff is professional, attentive and courteous.  Now the food. Yes, it appears to be \"authentic\" Italian. It helps when you have several Waiters FROM Italy and they say it is 99% the same as \"home.\" This is a good thing (and glad it's not of the Olive Garden kind of \"Italian.\")   I had the Veal Osso Bucco. Now I rarely eat this out as it IS a very hard dish to cook WELL. Thankfully, the chef here knew what he was doing as the meat was \"fall off the bone\" tender and very flavorful with a rich red sauce and of course, lots of garlic! Yummy!  My wife ordered the Pasta Carbonara which is one of MY very favorites. Kind of hard to go wrong with anything that has bacon/pancetta in it! And this one was RICH with their creamy and flavorful parmesan cheese white sauce. Delish!  We had some sort of an Italian ice cream (NOT gelato!) for dessert, but this was very unique, with almonds in it and an unctuous caramel sauce drizzled over it. I cannot for the life of me remember the name but is was outrageously delicious!  Only \"complaint\" was that the Caprese salad for the appetizer was very, very tiny for the price. Also my Osso Bucco did NOT come with pasta....had to order that for $6 separately.  Wine selection is small but nicely picked. By the glass prices are typically around $9 for a good glass. Bottles are somewhat expensive reflecting the Uptown real estate.  Overall this is an excellent restaurant! Recommend you checking it out.",

The service is great, the ambience phenomenal, the manager is actually italian, etc. I love coming here for dinners or just a bite at the bar, but like with the rest of cuisine in Charlotte, its just not awesome. I believe its because the water in CLT sucks.   Grilled octopus is the best thing on the menu. Hands down",
