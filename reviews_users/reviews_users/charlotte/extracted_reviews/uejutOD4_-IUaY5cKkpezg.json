The atmosphere is modern and chic, and a cyclists dream hangout. In addition to coffee, their panini sandwiches are delicious, and the Australian Sticky Cake is to die for as a late night dessert.   If you're tired of the suburban Starbucks and you wish you could get better coffee in a place with a more authentic, European feel, I highly recommend Rush. And if you walk by and see Paul back there making the drinks, you owe it to yourself to go in and try a latte. His are the absolute best you'll ever try!",

When you walk in, you immediately notice the modern, European aesthetic: lots of sleek black and metal accented by splashes of red. Most coffee shops tend toward the cozy, which is not a bad thing, but Rush's approach is welcome.  Fortunately, the coffee is high-quality as well (and also European). I have to admit, I didn't really care for the brew when they were serving Illy, but LaVazza is a much better label according to my taste buds.   Two more things I appreciate about Rush: the loyalty punch-cards and the fact that the owner remembers my name, even though I am sure he has customers who are much more frequent visitors than I.  If you're in Ballantyne, Rush should be high on your list of coffee options.",

They give you the option of either having your coffee drink in a mug (if you're staying there to enjoy) or in the now traditional to all coffee purveyors, the cardboard cup. I personally enjoy being able to get my coffee in a mug since it seems a lot less common at most coffee shops.  In terms of the actual coffee, they use \"illy\" coffee and of the half dozen visits I've had to \"Rush Espresso\", the coffee has been great!  I'd definitely recommend them.",

When we were greeted and asked for coffee, you would have thought we had 3 heads with the look we received. The gentleman behind the counter stammered and said they really we not serving coffee, but he could make me a Latte. When my husband asked for coffee, the gentleman proceeded to say there was no brewed coffee and never offered to brew a pot!  Then another couple walked in wanting coffee and they had to settle for a latte and espresso. Never in my life have I experienced a coffee shop not willing to make coffee!  I think they were most disappointed that we did not want to eat dinner and drink wine. However, this is a coffee shop, right??  The owner walked in when I was finishing up my Latte and spoke to my husband who voiced his disappointment in not being able to get a cup of coffee. The owner promptly offered to make a pot, but it was too late and we needed to get to the movie, where the theater brewed my husband a fresh cup of Starbucks!  Sadly enough, we won't be back to Rush Espresso. They need to decide if they are a coffee shop or a wine bar.",

I said no feta, gluten free bread. She says I didn't ask for gf bread for mine or my child's in a very defensive way.

    "text": "I have been to Rush several times and have given them many chances, but I am finally done giving them my business.  The staff here is the opposite of friendly and they couldn't care less about customer service.  Many different times I have ordered and paid for a certain size drink and received one size smaller \"by accident\". Then, when I mention the fact that the drink is the incorrect size, I am accused of being incorrect and the staff gets annoyed at me for having to fix the drink. Lets not forget that coffee here is not by any means cheap. I also very rarely get my latte made with any amount of foam on the top, which is a pretty common signature of a latte. Whenever I come in at busy times, I am rushed through the line in a way that makes me feel as though I am an inconvenience, and my drink is made in about 20 seconds (which is why it tastes awful). On another occasion, I hurried over to make it in time for happy hour (3-4) and paid for my drink at exactly 4:01, only to be told I missed happy hour. Talk about customer service! Overall, I am just not impressed with Rush in terms of the quality and taste of drinks, the attitudes of the workers, and the prices. There are way too many coffee shops around Charlotte for me to keep giving my money to Rush. This place is overrated. If you are looking for awesome coffee and a friendly vibe, check out Javas Brewing, Mugs Coffee, and Fabo Cafe!",

Well, we waited nearly 50 minutes for food, which, by the way only included 2 poached eggs and 2 pieces of bacon that required actual cooking, my husband had a toasted bagel. While we were waiting an eternity for our food, with our 9 month old baby, someone doing maintenance in the ceiling actually asked if we could move so he could put his ladder where our table was. Um no. We cannot. Finally when our food arrived, my husband said to the server \"wow, that took forever\", to which the server responded \"yeah, man.\" Now I know why they ask for tips up front.

But having been here a few times recently (twice in the last week alone!), I thought I should leave a glowing review.  Almond Chai Latte - get it! You won't be disappointed. I finally found another coffee shop that makes them exactly the way I like them.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the food options. The chef (can I call him that in a coffee house? I think he's earned the title) even stopped by my table to ask what I thought of the sundried tomato melt - I assured him it was delicious & proved it by ordering it the next time I visited.  For a local shop with stellar coffee & food, I think the prices are reasonable.   Parking at Ballantyne Village continues to be a hassle through no fault of the store owners. (Google the drama about the former BV owner who kept the parking lots & won't allow customers to park there... ) Rush has been busy, so I'm very happy to see customers supporting the stores there.  If you're uptown, check out their new location in Latta Arcade. I haven't been by yet, but hope to trek a few city blocks from my office soon. I'm sure it will be worth it.",

There are probably ten to twelve tables but they do have a wonderful outdoor seating area that is a pretty decent size.   They have great food and coffee (duh!)  I came in and had the power bagel. I think it was called that. Anyways it had ham, Swiss, avavado, tomato, spinach, an cream cheese. What a great way to start the morning! I have had coffee wise two different drinks. The vanilla latte which was so amazing. They serve their coffee drinks in clear glass glasses and do a beautiful little design on top of the foam. I have also had the chai tea latte. I found the chai tea to be a little more sweet than I typically like it so I didn't finish it. They have a choice of vanilla spice or regular spice and maybe I had the vanilla. The location is great and seems to be convenient to everything!! Love this place and look forward to trying every drink they offer!",

The large party room they have is super weird though. It feels like you're in an entirely different place and it's so empty when you talk it just echoes really loudly and it's awkward.",

Every day we met at this place we will we usually buy a coffee and a pastry  or we will wait until all of us were at the place to eat together like we were planning on the last time we went. Last time we met this employee more likely the owner ask us if he could do anything for us and my friend said as a joke yes please help us pass this exam, he said NO is there anything I can do for you guys today looking at our cups I guess he got offended because my friend had a starbucks coffee we said no thank you and he said well that's cool I only pay $10,000 of rent, not knowing we were expecting other people to buy coffee and food. We felt disrespected and we felt that he was been racist, my two friends are Indians and I'm Hispanic. I work for a global company near the area that does catering and I'm NEVER going back or refer people to this place, I will be telling everyone about my experience and will be telling them all to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!",

    "text": "I love Rush Espresso.  When I came back to Charlotte after being gone for a year, I was very happy to see the business still open and seemingly doing quite well.  I visited the establishment every day while I was in town and the espresso drinks and breakfast was on par with just how I remembered it.    If I had one criticism of the espresso drinks at all it would be that the lattes really lack a discerning espresso flavor.  I really like a nice balance of sweet and espresso, and I detect more of a cream and sweet flavor when I drink my latte from Rush.  Maybe it's the barista making the drink, or perhaps it just the type of espresso used in the drink, but nonetheless, it's my two cents.  Having lodged this criticism, what I will say is that the flavor is consistent...  So they do have that going for them.    I would encourage everyone to support this coffee bar.  The owner is doing a hell of a job and I want it to stay around for my future visits to Charlotte.",

    "text": "I want to start by saying that I really love this place.  I have visited often professionally and personally for breakfast and coffee.  My husband, son and I were out to dinner at another place several weeks ago and just happened to pop in for espresso on a Wednesday evening!  We were excited to be warmly greeted with live music and dinning menu featuring tasty snacks to full on dinner.  We ordered wine and dessert and really enjoyed our night!  Our service was incredible and personable.  Excited, the three of us returned the next week and had the same great experience.  My husband and I decided then that we would make Wednesday our date night at Rush.  And so we returned for two more consecutive weeks for our committee to date night.  Once during regular dining menu hours and once during their Wednesday \"rush\" hour.  Sadly for the past two weeks we have had really poor service.  There was a very distinct difference in the service between the first two times and the last two times. Notably the timeliness.  It just felt that there was a disconnect between providing  service and just getting by.  Each of the two evenings had different servers.  Both not happy, not upset to be there but rather just going through the motion.  No smiling or greeting....just doing the job.  Slowly....  This most recent visit we were there for over two hours and it took 35 minutes with empty glasses on our table,  locked eye contact with our server twice and eventually my husband standing up to get our check.  This was confusing when 35 minutes before we told the server that we were done.  Not because she asked if we wanted anything else but because she happed to our table and I took that rare opportunity to ask if my husband wanted anything else.  We both told her we were finished.  No offer of dessert or coffee or more wine.  She said ok, cleared the water and didn't return until my husband stood up 35 minutes later.   No table should wait 35 minutes after beverages and plates are cleared for the check to be dropped.  The restaurant wasn't full,  no one was waiting for a table but she just kept slowly cleaning one dirty table while keeping her eyes down.  Basically,  it was  just poor service.  The food and beverages are great here,  but two out of four visits had poor, aloof, disconnected service.  The visit before the most recent was much the same.  The server was just very slow, never even smiled and didn't inquire if we wanted more of anything or if we enjoyed our dinner until he was dropping our check.  I will still visit for coffee,  but my husband and I are back on the hunt for date night it seems.  Our time is precious and I just want friendly and efficient service.",

The coffee is always wonderful (my favorite is chocolate hazelnut martini) and according to my sister the chai tea is the best she's ever had. If I lived closer, I would get a coffee from here everyday.   I've eaten more breakfasts than lunches here, but it's great all the time. I do prefer the breakfast to the lunch, I feel like it is more expensive for lunch for the amount of food you get. Most of the time I get the eggs benedict, my eggs are always poached perfectly on top of ham and the hashbrowns, all over spinach which is my favorite touch. The fruit option as the side always has a great variety of different fruits, which I love!   Finally, the owner is very charismatic and always greets his customers with a warm smile and converses with his regulars.   A+ all around",

At under $3 for the largest size they offer, getting out of my car and walking inside instead of sitting in a Starbucks drive thru and paying almost $5 is a no brainer. Super friendly staff, beautiful furniture and deco, great menu and it's always clean. Maybe not the best place to try to study since it's kinda noisy, but there is a separate hallway that's quiet (think Amelie's in noda). They are always very quick when it comes to bringing out my drink, even when it's packed inside and there's a line to the door.

I hate when poached eggs are wet when you get them, these were dry and perfectly creamy. I had some tea and my friend also ahda meal which she loved.   While there are a lot of people there working, I never once felt crowded by them and actually enjoyed listening to some of the sales pitches I heard.I actually took out some paper from my bag and started to write down some ideas I had for my projects.

You wouldn't think a place located in Corporate park would be so friendly and comfortable, but it was. The owner pulled a chair from our table, sat down, and began to chat with us. He wanted to know where we were from, what brought us to Charlotte, and all about our coffee/breakfast habits. It was really refreshing to see an owner of a coffee shop so engaged in his costumers, involved in the kitchen, and outgoing. I thought that was really classy.  I'm not only coming back because the owner was so nice, but the food was really good, too. Plus it was super cheap. I ordered their low fat yogurt granola & berry parfait.  My roommate and I split their ham and cheese croissant. It was melt in your mouth heavenly!   I also ordered a latte on the side and it was so good. They make their low fat milk so smooth and frothy. The espresso was strong and smooth!",

Had the Bacon Jam and Eggs, which is two perfectly prepared eggs atop toasted sourdough with sliced cherry tomatoes. A side of fresh guac and -get this- BACON JAM. WHAT?!?!? Never even heard of it but glad I tried this flavorful creation.  Good vibe, clean store and friendly employees.  This perfect meal and a great cup 'o jo to go with it at a fair price makes for a five-star experience. Keep up the good work.",

The interior does not appeal to me. The cafe side has unattractive fixtures and furniture. I started to migrate to the restaurant side because it was more appealing but the staff corrected me and asked me to sit in the cafe because I wasn't dining. I felt a little embarrassed and complied.  The espresso was proper, but I won't bother to try and sit down next time.",

    "text": "Today I woke up and decided to go to Rush Espresso Cafe in Ballantyne, to study for the GRE since studying at home is a distraction. After sitting at the table for about ten minutes,a man greets me and asks if I would like to order something. I told him \"not right now, I will in a moment.\" After, he precedes to ask me to move to another table because I was taking up a table of six. I moved but after I moved another female came and sat at the same exact table, I had been asked to move from. The man asked the female if she would like to order something. She gave her order, which was only a drink. She was still one person at a six person table. So I took it upon myself to ask the man why I was asked to move and she wasn't. He said,she ordered something at the exact moment. Mind you, I told him I would order something momentarily. He told me \"That girl is apart of a bible study group, they'll be here in about ten minutes.\" I said \"Okay\" and then this man says \"Do you not like the way I'm running my business, do I need to ask you to leave?\" I told him \" I didn't need to be asked to leave, I would leave on my own.\" he says \"You have a chip on your shoulder, you feel like you're a victim.\" and then he told one of his employees \"We made 4,000 people happy today and upset one.\" If you know me, I'm not the person to pull the race card but at this moment, I felt extremely uncomfortable. I was already contemplating leaving. He just confirmed that I needed to. While running a business, you don't tell someone they \"feel like a victim\" and you definitely don't tell someone they have a \"chip on their shoulder.\" Thats not how you conduct a business in a professional manner. What happened to customer service? My question to the man is How do you know a group of people weren't coming to meet me? I understand his point from a business standpoint asking me to sit at a single table but when the same thing occurs with someone of a different race than I am and nothing was said. Thats when the problem occurs, whether she ordered something or not. If I would've ordered my drink at the moment I was asked would I have still been asked to move since I was taking up a table of six? hmmm.",

The cashier who is always there is strange and covered with tattoos. She acts like the coffee shop is her own personal living room (notice I did not say kitchen) and that she prefers her own squad to visit her there. You can't call ahead to place to go orders (I've tried 4 times) because she/they always take their off the hook.   Update: The defensive response from Paul M. to my write up of my experiences at this coffee shop validates my opinion. He insults me rather than taking the opportunity to make improvements. I have given this place 4 chances and was let down each time. The first time the pastry I got was dried out, the second time the waitress got pissed because I asked her about a Nutella dish, and the last two I had to sit and wait because the phone was off the hook and I couldn't order in advance. So in short, the food, customer service, AND management are lacking. I have other options and will not give this place a FIFTH chance. I have been more than fair! Go kick rocks Paul M.",

With plenty of outdoor seating and a Cool Modern Interior, it is plenty Romantic and fun even if I'm alone!  My friend asked:  Who drinks Coffee at 9:00pm, and on Tuesday Night?

Occupying the former Dilworth Coffee location in Ballantyne Village, it's got virtually nothing in common with its predecessor. The space is modern and fairly austere in its appointment. There's a ton of outdoor seating as well.  As for the coffee, they recently switched to Lavazzo, which is fine by me. I wasn't particularly attached to Illy, their original supplier.  The menu is large, offering a wide selection of brewed coffee, espresso drinks, teas, smoothies, etc. Delectable offerings line the pastry case, and breakfast/lunch sandwiches are available to order.  It has more of a cafe feeling rather than a coffee shop, which I rather enjoy.   The owner is friendly and always goes out of his way to greet customers. Pretty much all the employees are overtly affable. A nice touch.  The usual lovelies: free wifi, no withering glances designed to make you leave your chair after hanging out and working for an hour or two, gender-specific bathrooms, indie music playing...  Prices aren't especially low, but I don't mind. It's worth it, to me. I just wish I lived closer and could frequent this south Charlotte gem more often.",

So i took a sip and it was cold and also had no Caramel in it.  So I took it back and the guy said I think I gave your girlfriend yours (which he didn't).

The cashier is all smiles.  You think there are only three tables but you look to your left and there's a whole other seating space to take advantage of. I came here right before the said happy hour and got a medium cappuccino sprinkled with hot chocolate powder for $3.75 (with tax). I saw that they also offered breakfast items that are similar to Bluestone Lane in NYC, like the avocado smash bagels and avocado eggs Benedict.  The drinks are all under $4, but the price of the menu items seem to make up for the difference. A fruit cup will set you back $5. However, my friend ordered a bagel and it was served on a nice platter. Good service and good environment. Bring a friend and have a coffee chat! It's quiet in the afternoon.",

The coffee itself tastes good and comes out at just the right temperature for me :) They also have a truly delicious set of baked goods. After a hike, or run, Rush is the perfect place to treat yourself :)",

As much as I love supporting local, we will not be coming back to this restaurant because of the overall poor service from the staff.",

My real complaint is that they have a small, ugly, and uncomfortable restroom. At a coffee venue you should be able expect a pleasant restroom to use after your morning coffee. I might also add that the fake plants should be replace with real plants to add to the over all decor of the new location.",

    "text": "I have now been here twice... Rush Espresso came very highly recommended and I now know why!! I came here on a Sunday morning and the girl working there was super nice and the coffee she made me was amazing!! Blows Starbuck's out of the water!! I could have drank 3 more rather than the 1 I limited myself to lol.    I came back in a few days later after work. They do close at 6pm and it was probably around 530-540ish when I walked in . They had already closed the kitchen so I couldn't try anything there and the guy working didn't seem thrilled about having to make me a drink.  It definitely was not as good as my first one, and he forgot the Hazelnut that I asked for. It was still good but I was disappointed. I know it's because he was in a hurry and wanted to finish cleaning up so they could close up (even thought there were many people still sitting in the store). I will obviously be back again and hope to get the girl I had previously :-)    All in all I recommend this place highly. Everyone raves about the food and the sweets that they have there and their coffee is a really great quality and tastes fantastic!!",

    "text": "We have a rather 'fancy' fully automatic espresso/latte/cappuccino maker on our coffee bar at home, so I am not typically one who buys a coffee drink in my own neighborhood...so why do I find myself at Rush at least 1 morning a week and lately, a few times more than that? The location is great! The selections are lovely! Inside and outside seating is a delight and the people around us are either quiet in their conversation or welcoming and inclusive if a tad louder.  Baristas are generally friendly and make a consistently fabulous drink!  I have had breakfast there, it was easily enough for lunch and took it into the office with me to enjoy part II later that same day. The lattes, my personal choice 99 times out of 100, are phenomenal and beautifully crafted!  I'll also say I've not used any app ever that was so effortless to navigate than that of Rush!  I would love for more to be done in this style!  GPS doesn't want you to find this little hidden gem, so be persistent in your looking, though once found, you'll wonder how you ever missed it. Located 'inside' the Ballantyne Village by Mellow Mushroom and Blue Tag, near the theatre area but on the first floor.   Single, unisex bathroom often has at least one waiting person, so hamster bladder clients (you know who you are) this is your warning to queue up earlier vs. later!  They have a half price happy hour in the afternoon and every 9 drinks nets you one free! RUSH on in today!",

This location has a breakfast menu with very basic but unique choices. I got a panini with turkey bacon, egg, and Indian chutney. Yum! I also got an iced coffee for a change, vs hot.

Although the menu says the size of a large drink is 16 oz the actual size is actually probably half that if you get it \"for here\". The \"to go\" sizes are closer to the menu but still don't match. Make sure you look at the sample cup/glass sizes in front of the register, rather than the menu, to tell what you're getting. Had the barista acknowledged this when I asked about the discrepancy, I'd probably feel better about my experience right now. But he didn't ... Nonetheless, I'll probably return here at some point because it's one of the few coffee houses in the area that isn't Starbucks. I'll just be more strategic in my approach to ordering!",

I almost fell over at the mere sight. Not common in Charlotte trust me. This place won me over the minute I stepped in the door. Not the mention the Aussie accent when the coffee is served. Now on the the more important things yes the coffee. This is the best place so far I have been to for coffee. The cold press is smooth and non-bitter as iced coffee should be and the hot coffee is perfectly prepared. I should mention happy hour is from 2 PM to 4 PM where you can get the Java jolt of your choice for half price! That gives me an excuse to sneak out of work and head over to Rush for a quick afternoon break. I have not sampled the foodies but I can say the coffee is awesome. I am a coffee snob and none of the shops I have been to have stacked up to this place. As far as the atmosphere goes the servers are pleasant and you get the periodic how is everything are you satisfied Mate? There is a modern decor similar to some of the shops I have frequented in Europe. I just wish they had those little Italian pastries to complete the package. The only downfall I can see is that they are located in Ballentyne and not close to where I live bummer. Otherwise I would become a permanent fixture similar to the time trial bike hanging in the shop! Oh well guess I can't have good coffee and a close location to where I live. Sigh...",

We were looking for an inexpensive outing so we picked out a well Yelp reviewed coffee shop.  The ambiance was nice, a little trendy but European.  My boyfriend ordered the coffee, which he said was incredible, and the lava cake. I tasted it and it was delightful.  I ordered a medium hot English Breakfast tea and the last lemon bar. My medium cup of tea was served in a small coffee cup. I felt taken advantage of. Then I tasted the lemon bar.  It was waxy. There was no sharp bite of lemon or flaky shortbread crust.  Again, I felt cheated.  Altogether we spent almost $20 on what should have topped out at $10.",

    "text": "I don't know if I am being picky about my coffee or if it actually is pretty mediocre. Either way it just wasn't working for me.  I'm going to say Rush was a last minute resort after finding out Terrace Cafe nearby had a 25 minute wait for lunch. No thanks we're on a 1 hour timetable and we've already used at least 15 minutes of it looking for a parking space. Along with weird way it's set up where you need to turn onto the street after making a round through the parking lot. For a fun game, see how many Ron Paul 2012 stickers you can spot while trying to find a spot!  The inside is sleek and modern looking, cool I guess. I really prefer warm tones to go with warm coffee and food but that's just me and you can't judge on appearances! The baristas here are friendly and patient while we figured out what to order thanks for that. I settled on a ham and cheese croissant, that was a total disappointment though I probably should've known better when I saw Swiss cheese paired with a croissant. Not exactly my favorite cheese to pair with a croissant but I figured it would be okay. It wasn't. The croissant tasted to me like something you'd buy in bulk at a grocery store toasted up a little and then pressed like a panini so as to kill the airy light butteryness that is a croissant. Ham tasted decent though! I understand that it is primarily a cafe so I decided to get a single macchiato. It was disappointing as well. When I order a single shot of espresso I don't really expect it to come in a huge cup warm and rapidly cooling. No big deal lets test it out anyways. Blech, I didn't realize this but it is possible to have an extremely mild watery tasting espresso shot. I'm not sure about what type of beans they use but it just tasted like a regular coffee to me. At only $2 it's very reasonably priced though!  Return trips? Maybe for the desserts. The staff was genuinely nice and all, I just think the food and coffee is meh. There are better choices around town for a sandwich and for coffee as well.",

After giving Rush a fair chance, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The spot got a complete makeover and is now a European, trendy vibe.  The layout is much more conducive to meetings and getting together with friends and the seating is comfortable and stylish.  I would say that Rush is a little pricier but the quality of the food and coffee is definitely worth it.  I'm very glad to see a locally owned coffee shop again rise in Ballantyne!  Paul, the owner, is incredible - Such a personality and is truly grateful for his customers.  He may be running in and out but he always takes a moment to say hello to his customers and thank them for their business.  I give it 4 stars because the barista's are not as friendly.  I'm notorious for going into a new place and asking what servers, barista's etc., suggest and at Rush, I sometimes get a strange look for doing so. I have had wrong orders delivered a few times. I think those are kinks that will work themselves out but all in all, I'm a proud regular!",

    "text": "The experience I had was such a shame. I went in with a friend and while trying to decide what to order asked the young man on the register if they could do Cortado's (a shot of espresso with a little milk). He asked his female coworker (looked like she was the cook) if she could do a cortado and she said yes. The young man started entering an item into the register, to which I said, \"hang on, I'm still deciding.\" He than recommended I try a latte so I went with his suggestion. My friend ordered food and I even said at the register that I was sorry to make her eat alone. When they brought out my friend's food, they also brought out a frittata. We said we hadn't ordered that and the guy took it back. A minute later the female cook came out and asked in an aggressive tone if I just didn't like the frittata or decided I didn't want it. I was confused and said I'd never ordered it. She said \"Didn't you ask about the frittata?\" I wasn't sure why I was being questioned when I had just said that I didn't order a frittata and no, never even asked about it. She was obviously annoyed as she took it back.  My friend and I were both kind of taken back by the experience. Some time later, I realized they must have misheard me when I'd asked for a cortado. I went to the counter and told the gentlemen that that was the case thinking it would bring some clarity to the confusion. He corrected my pronunciation of how I was saying cortado (by calling it a cortadito - which is another drink but who's counting) but said nothing else. No, \"sorry about our miscommunication\", \"that was our fault\", \"sorry for charging your friend for a meal she didn't order\", nothing. Just the same look of annoyance we got from the female employee.  Maybe I'm expecting too much from coffee shop employees but the place really did seem to be about more than that. The food presentations looked like they did have some real passion for what they were doing, much more so than a normal coffee shop. Maybe that's why it was such a disappointment to leave feeling like I'd been accused by the staff for what was their error.   It's unfortunate that the customer service was so bad when the coffee was good and the food did look great. Luckily, I can get great coffee and great food plus customer service that doesn't leave me feeling confused at a number of other places.",

Amazing!  We go for weekend breakfast... A quick ham and cheese croissant for lunch... And late afternoon coffee with sweets! Yum! The Aussie owner makes it a point to remember customers.. Great casual place!",

    "text": "One of the worst experiences today at Rush thus far.  Unfortunately for us it has become the norm and not the exception.   The four stars is only because I like Rush and I want them to continue to succeed.  Pros:  Nice atmosphere and good food. If that's all you're looking for then read no further. Here's what happened today and I'm hoping this is read by management and addressed with the members of their staff.  1. I specifically ordered wheat bread and I specifically asked if there was any other type like 9 grain etc.  So the cashier told me the laundry list of breads.  I also stated that my order typically will come out with the wrong type of bread and I asked if they could \"flag\" it just in case.  The order came out with the wrong bread but I believe they gave me a wheat roll instead of wheat toast (which again at the beginning I asked if there was 9 grain, etc and I was NOT told there were 2 types of wheat).  So, now I will remember to ensure that they understand wheat toast next time.  So, I'll blame this on me. 2.  I specifically asked for balsamic on the side for my salad.  I received balsamic and oil. I took it back to the counter.  It took quite a while to receive it after that.  I did receive an apology from the cashier for that. :) 3.  Our orders came out separately with A LOT of time in-between each order.  The last order came out WAY after the first two orders. 4.  One of our orders had french fries and we received potato chips.  My son elected not to say anything given how our lunch was going thus far.  I think he knew that my fuse was continuing to grow shorter given the experience we were having. 5.  Customer service - There wasn't any (with the exception of the apology for the mix up on the balsamic).  Not one time were we greeted nor did anyone acknowledge the number of inconveniences.  The cashier took my order and told me how much I owed while my husband and son were standing right beside of me.  The reason I mention this is because the cashier was completely disengaged on what was going on and it seemed as though she wasn't quite sure what she was doing.  When I asked about our last order from one of the \"waiters,\" that passed by, he essentially told me he didn't know and he thought the \"cashier\" was checking on it and that was it.  Not one person came to me to let us know when to expect the rest of our food. Again, I really want Rush to continue to be successful.  The only reason I am writing this review instead of deciding to leave it alone is because if the owner/management doesn't know what is transpiring while they are away, they cannot address it and try to hopefully correct it.  Rush is a trendy fun place with good food and I know they can get the customer service piece back on track.  When you go out you want to be greeted and made to feel that you are welcome.  When you leave you should be told thanks, come again or have a great day.  I totally get it if it's overly busy and maybe some of that is lost along the way.  Every time we have been in recently there are a good number of customers but it hasn't been packed or overwhelming for the staff.  It's a steady trickle of customers.  Also, we have mainly noticed that the problem is more predominant during the day versus the evening.  All the best Rush but it will be a while before we return.",

The benedict was pretty tasty - there are 2 poached eggs on top of guacamole and spinach on sourdough with baby tomatoes on the side. The best part is when you break the egg and you soak up the yolk that runs down the side with the bread. It's definitely pricey for the portion ($12) but it's a good option for a healthy, light breakfast. They bring your food out to you but they call your name once they make your coffee and you have to go to the counter and get it. Coffee tastes similar to what you would get in Europe, but sizes are smaller also.",

    "text": "Discovered this place a few days ago after dropping my daughter at the movie theatre across the way.  She wanted to find a coffee place that she could go and hang out afterwards with her friend and I decided to check this place out for her.  I almost didn't go in because of the wine bar part and thought it might be too froofroo (is that a word?) or adult.  It wasn't!  It was a really cool, comfy looking cafe that was bright, clean, not too loud and just overall nice.  The seating was plentiful and they even have a hallway to sit in as overflow that seemed nice and bright, crisp and clean.  I was only able to peek into the hallway because it was closed due to some construction work going on but it's definitely a cool place to do some studying, hang out with friends and get some work done.  My other daughter was with me and we decided to stay and have lunch.  Now, I must say I do wish that their menu for both drinks and food was displayed somewhere because we just happened to be looking to see what was left in the baked goods display and saw a stand with menus in them nearby.  We also had to have the cashier look up the prices for the hot drinks because they aren't on the menu and neither is the hot chocolate on the menu, we just happened to ask if they had any. The prices for the food were very reasonable in my opinion, especially since each meal comes with choice of a side.  Score!  We ordered two hot chocolates, and two meals.  I got the Australian meat pie with a side of thick cut fries and my daughter got the chicken pot pie with a salad.  We got our number, found our seats and patiently waited.  Someone brought our hot chocolate over and it was delicious. My only complaint was that it was lukewarm which was a bummer but we still drank it.  Next time I will ask them to make sure it is hot.    The Food:  The food came out in a timely manner and it wasn't a long wait at all.  The cashier said that the pies were made in house, the fries are not (but they were still good).  It was my first time trying an Australian meat pie and it was pretty good but it had a tartness that I wasn't expecting, maybe from worcestershire sauce or something.  No fault of theirs, I just didn't know what to expect.  I brought the leftovers to hubby and he loved it.  The fries were hot and salted nicely and I was promptly brought mayo when I asked for it.  I'm not a ketchup girl.  The chicken pot pie was meaty and very good, though it needed a tad bit of salt but hey, that's what salt and pepper shakers are for.  It was supposed to have bacon in it, I thought, but we didn't see or taste any bacon at all, which was a bummer.  Maybe the bacon would have added the saltiness it needed.  The salad was perfect.  It had mixed greens, feta, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a lemon vinaigrette on the side.  Both meals were 8 bucks a piece and worth every penny.  Check out the pics.  Beautiful flakey crust, good amount of filing and no skimping on the sides.  We fell in love with the place!  My other daughter and her friend did go over to Rush after their movie and they said they walked in and it was really busy and they didn't see a drink menu or any menu so they left and went to get TCBY!! What?!!  I texted her pics of the food and drink we had there and told her to ask for a menu but by the time they went back her friends brother had come to pick them up so they have a date planned for next week. Happy to know this place is so close to home and I look forward to future visits because it appears, from the yelp pictures, to have different menu choices available at certain times. This will certainly become my go to coffee shop/cafe.  That is all!",

We ordered a few things off the menu and unfortunately all of them were very dry.  Maybe I will come back and change the review after trying it again, very open space to get some work done.  It seem like they do have Live Music as well, we went in the afternoon.  Coffee is good, the wine collection looked good.  A place that can be tried again, but I would be very wary of ordering any food.",

What actually keeps me coming back beyond all that is how amazingly the environment is conducive to productivity.  Every time i go in there I plow through work that I have been putting off.

Generally I have to dump some sugar or more cream in it to enjoy (I'm not a huge coffee person, but still enjoy it), but I did nothing to their cup and it was awesome. Cool design art in the foam, the Barista knew what he was doing. They gave me the classic jab at Starbucks \"we don't burn our beans\" speech. Which is fine, even though I don't think Starbucks burns their coffee; it's just a different bold roasting process they go through. Anyways....  the coffee was great. Price was fine. Will be a regular when I want to stretch the legs and grab a cup of coffee at work.",

    "text": "I've walked by Rush a bunch of times, had some great passion fruit iced tea, but tonight, finally tried out the food menu, and I just may have a new favorite panini!  The Perth Panini (named Perth, inspired by Australian owner, Paul) is innovative and different, and although has no meat, would be great for carnivores and vegs alike.  The cibatta is soft and fresh, and inside, a layer of grilled sweet potato, caramelized onions, spinach, zucchini, red peppers, and HALOUMI CHEESE! Love me some Haloumi! (you know, the Greek cheese that usually is served flaming?)  Paul said most of his customers didn't know what it was, but once they have it, love it.   I also got a side salad for $3 which was a nice size.  It had feta cheese, yellow bell peppers, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and red onion.  No heavy dressing-- really refreshing with the panini.   When the woman behind the counter told me their desserts are all made in-house, I bought 3 mini cheesecakes (before you think I'm a pig, know these are about the size of a Sacajawea coin) for $1, and a mini cream-filled carrot cake.  The cheesecakes were super rich and yummy, just the right size, and the carrot cake was moist and not too sweet.   TIP:  Get a frequent buyer card. After 9 coffees, your 10th is free.    The setting too is modern and inviting-- the owner's wife is also super nice, and makes you feel welcome. Love the Australian touches, like the Australian Meat Pie on the specials board, and the European drinks, like the affogato. (They use Illy coffee so it's gotta be good.) Can't wait to go back and try them!",

Not bad at all, but the sandwich was thrown together and the chips were from the bottom of the bag (crumbled and smashed! Gheez! just open a new bag). The dessert, though a good variety, looked old and stale. There were at least 2 flies on the chocolate croissants. The location is pleasing as you can take a moment to walk over to TCBY or Mellow Mushroom. Also the movie theater is upstairs if you prefer.",

You place your order at the counter and then grab a number and a it down at a table. Your drinks are followed by food order are then brought to your table. There is a self-serve counter with water and glasses and milk and sugar, etc. That was nice as my husband usually drinks several glasses of water and this way he didn't have to bother anyone for them. There were plenty of tables to sit at and there were outlets and WiFi,  so you could work there.    The food was good and light. The presentation of the food was likely the prettiest I've ever seen my breakfast presented. If you're looking for a reasonably priced and good coffee and a seat,  then you're gonna find that. And,  you can get a yummy and healthy light breakfast that is a little on the pricey side.  If you're looking for a large breakfast to cure you from a hangover or prep you for some intense day of running,  this is probably not the place for you.  Would definitely come back here for a coffee and a light meal. Also,  this is a good spot if you want to have a chat with someone over breakfast/coffee. It's not too loud.  Just depending on the level of privacy you need for the conversation,  you might want to choose a further table from where everyone else is sitting.",

This is definitely somewhere I would come to hangout and get some work done.  I wish they had a better selection of packaged coffee but I bought a bag anyway to grind at home. The prices are a bit high for the sizes they offer, but it was still a great cup of coffee.",

We were seated right away when we got there. Their dinner menu is pretty limited.   I decided to get the lamb burger which came with fries. I thought the burger was pretty good, but the fries were just ok. The portion size was surprisingly small. Usually a burger and fries is more that enough food for me, but I was still hungry.   The worst part of the experience was the slow service. It took a very long time for us to get our food and our water didn't get refilled. We waited so long for our server to come back that we gave up and tracked someone down to get our check so that we weren't late for our movie.   Our brunch experience was much better than our dinner experience, so if I were to come back, it would be for brunch.",

The help made orders for other people, walked around the restaurant and never once looked up at the line at the counter. I turned around and looked at the person behind me and she threw her arms up in the air in exasperation. I told her she could have my spot in line.",

My aunt and I had our drinks to go but I would definitely come back here for food or to relax with another cup.   My aunt asked what brand chai tea they use, and we were told they make their own. She was hesitant but said okay, I'll go out on a limb. He asked if she wanted it spicy, and she said no, so he made it \"regular.\" It was DELICIOUS and she loved it. I had a medium roast with sugar free hazelnut. They make their own flavors, and love that they have more sugar free options than Starbucks.   So great. Will be back!!",

It's a decent size where half is a coffee shop and the other half is a bar with stage area. On Saturday nights they have a live band. It was clean and the staff were friendly. The bartender is what made this place 4 stars. He was attentive nice and noted he is there most days. He did a great job on our drinks and made suggestions. The drinks were tasty and strong. I would recommend the evening bar scene and can't wait to see what the day time coffee shop is like. Hope you enjoy!",

If you want a full dinner, they have the option as well - amazing short rib sliders, burgers, tacos, and crab cakes that will easily fill you up.

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Rush, and I'm sure it won't be my last. With Adam R's affinity (addiction?) to coffee and that fact that he now works in the area, I imagine I'll be returning.  With Charlotte awash in restaurants and coffee shops that revel in their French coffees, a place that specializes in Italian coffees is a fresh change. While Rush very clearly advertises that they use Illy coffees and machines (a well-established provider of Italian coffees and espresso machines), they are still a locally owned, private business - don't let the branding fool you, it's an original.  The coffee is pretty dang awesome. It's light and has just the right touch of bitterness. You can see the owners' little hints of their native Australia mixed into the menu - all of which seems like a pretty good value and branches out beyond just the traditional baked sweets. The names of the menu items are straight-forward and very easy to order.  The interior is very sleek and trendy-modern with lots of stainless steel and bold colors. The patio is spacious with at least as many tables outside as inside.  Can't wait to try them again!",

Many times we are quick to review poor experiences and not the good ones. There will be both because we are not robots and you can not be \"on\" every single time you work. With that said, I noticed a fella with a beard and silly mustache, maybe his name is Alex, always bustin his buns. He is always professional, attentive and pleasant. There is also another fella with a hipster bun, don't hold that against him, who does a great job as well. I would love to say the same for the females but they seem to what to spend their time giggling and pretending not to see customers.  Overall, this place is good and I enjoy when I am helped by either of the gentlemen there. Its hard to fine good workers and honest people, so when you do, hold on!",

We all know local is all around better in every way from the people to the product. The coffee here beats any corporate shop (especially SB) by a mile! The food is just as incredible. Everything is fresh and tasty. To top it off, the service is phenomenal. If you are there in the morning, the owner makes the place feel so full of life and is super friendly and personable. Service is always excellent, no matter what time you stop by. Highly recommend this place for your daily coffee or lunch hangout.",

It's also got gross brown lettuce in it, so I've got that to look forward to. Plus, the sign out front that says $5 Express Lunch should probably be taken down since there is no such thing as a $5 express lunch. The only thing on the lunch menu that's $5 is a side salad, which I'm guessing would be maybe a cup of greens and a tomato? Not gonna lie, I'm crazy disappointed in this. Maybe their other stuff is better.",

Pretty sure one guy is from Australia and boy is he friendly!  This place serves some high-end product. They recently switched from only selling blends from illy coffee (one of my favorites of the commercial world) to a more recent brand called LavAzza. Pretty good stuff.   On occasion, I've even seen a bit of latte art come out of Rush! Not sure who the baristas are, but some of them can actually make you something special. Nice to see in yuppyville.   It's so nice to see some baristas who can actually tamp, pull and pour a decent espresso in south Charlotte. These places are few and far between from Ballantyne to Uptown. Definitely worth asking for something daring, folks. Step away from your cozy and boring triple shot, venti frappucino. Or whatever. This place knows how to make you a cafe latte.   Definitely worth venturing and trying some of their teas as well. They carry a great brand of bright and flavorful teas to choose from.   The vibe inside is a little pretentious but that's a bit expected. It's a little too clean and overrun with non-hipsters. Can't be too choosy, though. It is Ballantyne after all.   If you're in the Ballantyne area, support this local business rather than one of the larger chains. Definitely worth the coin and much more love goes into their beverages.   Get to know the owners as well! They have great stories.   Thanks for existing, Rush. Glad to have a place like this in our neck of the woods.",

I particularly love their chai though, Vanilla more than the Spiced. I always order them with 2% milk so they froth more. This place is just amazing!

I picked it up and to my surprise it was burned. Now who would serve disgusting burnt bacon?! Such a disappointment! I don't send food back, not my style, and I've heard too many horror stories.

Drinks are half off excluding those with ice cream and smoothies.   I was a little disappointed because my drink came in a to go cup when I said the order was for here, but the taste made up for it.

There are lots of options (but not to overwhelming) and the servers are friendly and helpful if you can't decide.   The only thing they leave you wanting at the end of your visit is a location right down the street from you.   Needless to say my best suggestion would to open a location in Mooresville or Huntersville/Cornelius.   Keep up the good work.",

The coffee here is delicious and our only request was that they hopefully increase their stock of chai. Personally responding to a concern is a great example of why we love to visit local businesses. Also to clarify, our visit occurred a few weeks ago and point taken that I should have been more specific. Thank you for caring about your customers' experience!",

Not sure what ice cream they use, but it was delicious - a perfect complement to mellow out the espresso. Great atmosphere and perfect spot for people watching!

The owner, Paul, converses with the customers and will also be the first to get behind the counter and help when it gets extra busy, which I admire as not all owners will get their hands dirty, so to speak.   There is outdoor seating available and I enjoy sitting outside as well as inside. There is a wide variety of foods to choose from and I have yet to try all the things that look good. Whether you want a meal or pastry with your coffee (or smoothie) they have you covered.   I also really love that it is a local place. The atmosphere is very modern yet cozy and not too loud. There are plug ins scattered around for those who want to get some work done on a laptop or tablet.

I sat here waiting for my client for about 10 minutes and personally saw the owner talk to every single customer and knew almost everyone by name. I love to support local places wherever I go and will definitely be coming to Rush instead of Starbucks, every time I am in the Ballantyne area.  Staff, service, quality and prices are impeccable. Even from the small things of having free water, to having a fun and different coffee sleeve.  I will be back and highly recommend this place.
