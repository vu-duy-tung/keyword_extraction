It was clear they were understaffed and we had to wait for a table for 20 minutes even though there were a few empty throughout the restaurant. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 meals and they forgot one of the appetizers but were very apologetic about it. The staff was super friendly, you could just tell they were missing a few extra hands so getting a table, getting drinks, and ordering food took longer than expected. The food was really good and made the crappy service worth it.",

    "text": "Pretty good food with a Cajun flair. I think of Boudreaux's as Cajun Lite, because let's face it, they're not authentic Bayou.  Slow service. Always. Expect it. Plan on it. Don't let it harsh your buzz.   The food here can range from good to really outstanding on any given day.   I usually found the waiters to be as friendly as their limited time permitted.   I ate at Boudreaux's about once every two weeks.  The wait staff remembered that I drank sweet tea!  Service is not bad, it's just not very fast. The problem is that many times during lunch, there is only one person waiting on everyone. My schedule was always flexible, so getting back on time from lunch was not a problem. For those on a tight schedule, having lunch here and getting back to the office on time, could easily be a tricky proposition. Fast food - this is NOT.  My favorite lunch entrees were the Cajun meat loaf, and their smothered pork chop.  I liked the collards and mac 'n cheese for side dishes.   I ate at shrimp po boy ONCE, and it was mostly lettuce. I did not order this again.   I love the funky decor, the relaxed atmosphere, and their central NODA location. I was usually able to park right on the street next to the restaurant.   Prices are reasonable for the quality of their food.   When I wanted something really good for lunch, this was my destination. This is one of the places in Charlotte that I really miss.",

They didn't have a wait and unfortunately I found out why. This had been a favorite when we were visiting Charlotte, and now that we had moved back it seemed like a logical choice.  The waitress was great and we gave her our entire order at once.  The beer was cold and my CAT 4 HURRICANE were the best parts of our meal.  I started out with the SEAFOOD GUMBO, full of flavor and barely tepid. Having been in and out of the Food Service Industry most of life, bad food and bad service usually makes me your worst customer nightmare. This night I wasn't in the mood because of the performance we were going to.  I had the SHRIMP and CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE....once again tepid...the roux wasn't dark, not much flavor and no HEAT...thank God there was hot sauce on the table. My wife had the Jambalaya...this was hot....but unfortunately dry. My cornbread was hot and moist my wife's was burned and dry. Her next piece was right. Did the kitchen not notice the burnt edges!  Well BEAUDREAUXS we tried but unfortunately you did not. Next time we'll just bide our time at CABO or one of the other restaurants in NODA.",

The oysters are so tiny, and it's not worth the money. Actually put the gator bites on the do-not-order list as well. They're smaller than the popcorn chicken you get at KFC.  I normally come here and order the gumbo or she crab soup and make that a meal. A bowl runs you about $8-9, which is a lot more tolerable. Sometimes the gumbo comes out luke warm (at best), but it tastes good enough. If anything, consider this place for a drink, they do have drink specials on the hurricanes and wine and beer.  I really hate that one of the few cajun places in Charlotte is going downhill.",

I tried the gumbo and it lacked seasoning. I had to add lots of hot sauce to provide flavor. The cornbread was flavorless as well. I prefer to have some butter on the cornbread.

The food hit the spot for a southern girl.   I had the bourbon fried chicken Meat&Three option  -the sauce was perfect and full of flavor. The Charleston cheddar grits hit the spot. And the collard greens were also bursting with flavor. The only complaint: the corn bread was a bit dry and not served with any butter.   The service was great, attentive - should've been anyhow considering there were only 2 other tables. Our drinks never went dry. We left full and satisfied. Definitely worth the trip back to the NoDa area to try a few more dishes.",

My BBQ shrimp had a very funny and unfamiliar taste to it. The sauce even stated strange. By 8:30p we all were ready to order. It took exactly one hour and fifteen minutes for our food to come out. The manager brought it to us because we were beginning to have reservations and concern of the wait time. And they guest around us were getting their food sooner.  I totally understood that this was a busy night for them and it was a Friday but 1 hour and 15minutes for your entree is a bit long.

Inside, they weren't as juicy as oysters near the beach, but they were decent for being in Charlotte.  Overall, they were solid, but I've definitely had better.   For my entree, I ordered the mulatte, which is shrimp and crawfish etouffee over blacked fish.  Etouffee is tough to cook well and having been to New Orleans, I've had the real stuff.  The etouffee here was pretty tasty  and held its own well.  There is some creole spice to the dish that gave it that Louisiana taste.  The sauce was good and made for a tasty dish.   However, there weren't that many crawfish compared to the shrimp, and the shrimp were an average size.  Both didn't taste as fresh as they could've been, but the fish was the highlight of the dish.  I chose tilapia and it was seasoned and blackened exceptionally.  All the Cajun spices were sealed in the blackened crust, giving it some great flavor.  All this was served over rice with a pice of cornbread, making it a very filling meal.   Overall, the food was good at Boudreax's, but not great.  My rating would really be 3.5 stars.  Fresher seafood would really enhance some of their dishes a lot, but for being in Charlotte, their food is worth try if you're craving some New Orleans inspired food.",

We had out of town guests with us on Friday evening and were originally looking to eat elsewhere, but the wait was too long, so we decided to walk up the street to Boudreaux's. It wasn't too crowded, so we decided to get a table. The waitstaff did not show up until we had to ask the host to send someone over. Although our waiter was friendly, he delivered the wrong items to our table. One of our guests didn't receive his food until everyone was almost done eating. This place just isn't worth it.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Boudreaux's, Yelp didn't even exist in Charlotte.  Since then I confess, I had forgotten about this Cajun haven.  In recent weeks however, I have rediscovered this NODA treasure and it has quickly become a staple in my food/restaurant rotation. Here's why...  Parking:  As I reflect, one of the reason's I stopped going is because the parking situation is so precarious.  Like so many other establishments in NODA, there is no parking-lot reserved for Boudreaux's patrons.  You're best bet is to UBER or cab-it, but if you have to drive, try the many side-streets of NODA or perhaps in the YMCA parking-lot down the street.  Service:  My initial return visit was the evening of Friday, April 22. I was there for a birthday dinner for a good friend.  On that visit, I had some of the best service I've ever had anywhere in Charlotte.  The waiter, who my buddies said, they've had before, was on point with everything - drinks, clearing the plates, asking us if we needed anything, extra napkins, splitting the checks, etc.  Simply amazing service.  My most recent visit came this past Saturday - April 30th, around 1pm.  The service was just ok.  To be honest, it was a little on the slow side.  Nothing outrageous, I just thought it could have been a bit better is all.  Ambiance/Lay-out:  The atmosphere at Boudreaux screams NODA in so many ways.  They have a nice open-air seating/dining area similar to Cabo and many other spots in the area.  There's also a nice bar area with plenty of high-top chairs and seating directly at the bar as well.  Then of course they've got a plethora of tables and booths scattered throughout.  It never feels like its well-lit in there, but who cares.  There's a huge book-shelf, with a bunch of books I'm willing to bet haven't been opened in decades, separating the dining sections - so NODA.   Food:  Let's start with the Gumbos.  That's right 'Bos, because they have THREE different types of GUMBOS!!!  I sampled my friend's \"YAYA\"Gumbo and was so amazed with how tasty it was, I ordered a cup of the \"Signature Seafood\" Gumbo  myself - even better!!  They both have a nice soft bed of rice that soaks up all the soupy elements of the Gumbo.  They also serve their soups and Gumbos with a nice hearty piece of cornbread.  But what made me go back in the span of a week you ask?!  The Mutha-F-in SHRIMP AND GRITS!!!  The evening of my friend's birthday I got the \"T-Boo\" or small portion and loved it so much I went back the next Saturday and got the \"Beau Jacques\" or large portion!  Pick an adjective - amazing, real and spectacular, yummy, tasty!  The shrimp and grits contains plenty of andouille sausage, peppers, onions, plenty of creole seasonings and shrimps all over a bed of creamy, tasty, cheddar grits!!  The flavors and textures work together in perfect harmony - the crunch of the peppers and the softness of the grits for example.  So good, all I can do is be quiet and shake my head...        Rarely do I give 5-stars because of one menu item, but this place gets 5-stars bc of the SHRIMP and GRITS alone!!  I can't wait to go back.  If you're ever wondering if you should go to Boudreaux?  I say Boud-Yes!!!",

I have to add that the bride is from Louisiana and all of her family came to SC for the wedding, so they were anxious to see how Boudreaux's compared to what they were used to.   I was the contact for the reception, and was asked to coordinate the arrival and distribution of dinner. Once Kevin and Pete arrived, they wouldn't leave until everything was set in place and we were confident with what was in place. After my team and I served the approximately 250 guests, several of them came back for seconds and a few even came back for thirds.   Everyone raved about how good dinner was. Even the Louisiana family absolutely loved it. The bride and groom were ecstatic!!! That's definitely a bonus! The menu included: House salad w/ a variety of dressings and homemade croutons, Grilled Andouille Sausage, Blackened Chicken, Gumbo ya-ya, Jambalaya, Shrimp & Crawfish Etouffee & Fresh Grilled Veggies.   We would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone and everyone. Whether it's for lunch or dinner at the restaurant or for catering an event. These guys know what they're doing and have the customer service and expertise to show it. Thanks again for helping make this the best day of the bride and grooms lives!",

I started out with the alligator bites. The dipping sauce was good, the bites were crispy and flavorful but a little dry. I proceeded to order the fried chicken and jambalaya.  First, I was not expecting so much food that I had to get it to go. The jambalaya was full of shrimp, sausage and crawfish and the rice cooked perfectly.  The boneless chicken had great crunch and full of flavor.  The cornbread hardened too quick but was good.  The only other issue I had was the smell of cigarette smoke I detected from the patio area that interfered with my dining experience. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and will go back when I return to Charlotte.",

    "text": "As both myself, many friends and my boyfriend have all been servers in many establishments, we all tend to notice a bit more than your average customer. Not so much because we want to (sometimes it takes a LOT away from a dining experience), but because we were trained to. Generally, when I go out with my boyfriend we get lackluster service. I don't know if it's the combination of our 20-something age and generally casual appearance or the fact that we don't really try to ask much or seem to require attention. Either way, we've been searching for a decent place with attentive, but not obtrusive service that has good food absolutely NOTHING LIKE a chain restaurant.   We found it.   I found Boudreaux's on yelp while searching for something, anything new. All the reviews were helpful and mostly accurate. We headed down there and it was easy to find. Parking nearby costs $3 if you're a pansy like me and don't feel like parallel parking a Buick. There's a little box that you shove some dollar bills into and I'm ASSUMING someone checks it, but who knows. Maybe it's just an honor system.   We sat in the front room behind the garage like door that connected one of the dining areas to the patio. It was open, the sun was beautiful, the breeze was nice. Once it got chilly, the server closed it.   Our server was polite, but not stuffy, friendly, but not overly talkative. The best part of dining in a non-chain restaurant is that the servers are not under penalty if they don't immediately try to offer you 3 beverages, an appetizer and up sell the special. They're more inclined to tell you the special, trust you to READ the menu and answer any questions you may have honestly without sweating bullets because they have a mental checklist of things they HAVE to say. If so inclined they might tell you THEIR favorite, but it's not a forced speech. That is what we got. Perfection. Nothing forced, no worries on those pesky shoppers.   The Food: We ordered the Shrimp & Grits (couldn't resist) and the Shrimp Creole Rotini. I can honestly say the Shrimp Rotini was one of the best things I've eaten in years. There's an obvious bite to both dishes w/o overpowering the whole dish and both were served with delicious cornbread. Also, they have many different hurricanes, but we only tried the category five which was fruity, but strong and absolutely perfect.   The very next day I was craving some more Boudreaux. The atmosphere was so laid back, the food was so good, the service was so fantastic and relaxed, but on point. I ended up dragging along a friend, trekking up to NoDa and doing it all over again. This time we got the Gator Bites (delicious spicy mayo) and I was feeling the fried shrimp. Still delicious, still great service, still good hurricanes, still love it.   My boyfriend told me that that area (I'm still slightly new to Charlotte) didn't use to be so filled with funky little places and interesting restaurants. He said a lot of them fail too. When we asked our server how long they'd been open he told us ELEVEN years. Now that's what I like to hear. That means that without all the bells and whistles and fancy stuff, this place has survived solely because it has soul. Good management, I assume, great food and no pretense. It makes sense.   I wish I lived right next door to this place. They'd get tired of me sitting there downing their delicious cooking, reading Creative Loafing and sipping on Hurricanes. I can't wait to try the Cajun Mary.",

My expectations were a little high because I travel to New Orleans sometimes just to eat or bring back seafood. But this place is really good and reasonably priced for this kinda of food. Next time I will definitely try the brunch. In a great neighborhood..very artistic creative vibe in the air.",

My only gripe was that the home fries were a little soggy for my taste.",

If you are unfamiliar with the NoDa district (as am I) you may pass by this place without second thought. However, don't miss out. My meal consisting of catfish, collards, and sweet potato fries was phenomenal!   However, I must note that my coworker ordered alligator bites as an appetizer, and I was less than impressed. It was not seasoned very well and was a bit chewy for gator.   I can only rate based upon the one meal that I had. But so far, so good!   : )",

There was one waiter for a long time and then finally a second waiter showed up. The service (although super busy) was very friendly and efficient.   We ordered the crab bruschetta, the jerk chicken sandwich, and the mahi mahi mulate. While the prices are fair (pretty cheap actually) the food is exactly what you pay for. The crab bruschetta thing was ok - no flavor and the texture reminded me of something from a can. The jerk chicken sandwich was blah - I literally just ate the chicken (which had NO spice or flavor...I thought this was a JERK chicken sandwich??) as the bread was too hard to bite into (stale?). The Mulate was pretty good - the etouffe was good but nothing memorable. The best part was probably the fries that came with the sandwich.   Overall - blah blah blah. Nothing was awful but nothing was good enough to make me come back.",

People were getting new alcoholic drinks when they didn't even order them, but when they were ordered it would take 20 minutes to arrive....want a beer?  How about the wrong one?  To the wrong person...food came out and the temperature ranged from piping hot to downright cold. How you do this with the same entree is downright impressive, btw!  The bills came out...wrong. It was just ridiculous. Only thing that saves this from a 1 star is the crawfish and spinach appetizer was awesome and some of the entrees were decent (and not cold).

    "text": "After a gluttonous weekend, we decided to walk to Boudreaux's for our Sunday morning recovery food.  Well, most of us did, but we split up so that some of us took a car and put our name in.  When we asked for 10, the hostess looked quite worried, even when we said we'd sit separately, and advised us to call ahead next time.  Is this really a problem, when only three tables in the place have customers?  But by the time we were seated and everyone got there, the restaurant was packed, and there was a line out the door!  So take her advice: for large parties, call ahead.  I could really get to like this place, at least the bar.  $2.50 Mimosas on Sundays!  Woohoo!  The server was very friendly, and took our orders for beverages, even though she couldn't legally serve us for 20 minutes.  Sure enough, as soon as noon rolled around, we saw the bartender making our order.  They were pretty good mimosas, especially for $2.50.  I was going to go with the Croissant Florentine (eggs Florentine on a croissant), but opted instead for the special omelet (shrimp, chevre, asparagus, spinach, tomatoes).  I was glad that I'd avoided the Croissant Florentine because they'd used frozen spinach, but I wasn't thrilled with the omelet, since the eggs were overcooked, making the whole thing chewy.  I wish I could have just gotten those toppings on scrambled eggs.  The portions were HUGE, particularly for the biscuits and gravy.    While the food wasn't great, I think that had more to do with my tastes and poor ordering on my part.  The staff was wonderful with that relaxed Cajun vibe permeating the air.  I will definitely go back, but I'll be trying some of the Cajun classics instead of the omelets.",

I was reminded why its such a favorite, laid back casual atmosphere and excellent food at a fair price. A friend of mine who was a New Orleans native recommended getting the Beignets as they were as close to authentic one could get in this area. Alas I've never had them as they are only available at brunch.  On this visit I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy.

    "text": "Again, my Creole nose is tuned to the hunt to satisfy my craving for that perfect po'boy, that savory gumbo. Boudreaux was third on my list for my Cajun fancy, and I found myself there on Saturday night with a friend. There was about a 10 minute wait for a seat, which wasn't bad at all.   An absolutely lovely first Bloody Mary experience. Though the presentation was nothing like what Yelp's gorgeous picture provides, it was still smooth, yet hot and spicy. Good stuff, I would get another.  There was a bit of an awkward moment. My Cajun unicorn is a fried oyster po'boy. Never managed to have one, and have always been denied at the last minute. This was no exception.  Upon ordering, my waiter got a very sad, contemplative look on his face, informing me that due to the tragedy of the gulf oil spill, there were no more oysters. I stared at him incredulously, then slowly turned my eyes down to the Creative Loafing magazine I had open, to the page that advertised the largest oyster festival in the world that happened in Myrtle Beach that very day. Our eyes met and he had that panicked, feverish look that waitstaff sometimes get when they're fervently praying that you don't call them out on something.  So I didn't. I got a damn shrimp po'boy instead. [Miraculously, though the oysters were doomed, the shrimp managed to survive. Well... except for the ones on my sandwich.]  Incredulousness aside, the po'boy was pretty good. Huuuuuge roll, but it was soft, so there wasn't any bread stabbing painfully into my gums as I ate. Plenty of shrimp, so I guess my only lament would be that I wish the remoulade was tangier, or rather, tangy at all. I got the potato salad as a side, which didn't disappoint. Sweeter than most potato salads, but great herb flavor and just the right amount of creamy.  My friend got the bourbon chicken, which she tells me would have been great if it wasn't so salty. It seemed to put her off her meal and she only managed to eat part of it.  All in all, I think I'd be back again to sample some gumbo when all is said and done. However, I need to tack off the rest of the restaurants on my Cajun bucket list'o Charlotte before I return here.",

Then it took 15 minutes to be greeted by our server and once we noticed he didn't have a uniform, we knew it was going to bad. We waited 45 minutes for our food just for the server to tell us he dropped it all. We wait another 25 minutes for our refire and it tasted rushed, just as we expected. I had the shrimp and grits and the grits were thick and clumpy and the whole dish was overseasoned. We waited 15 minutes to try to see a manager but none of the servers were in the dining room. Finally we go to the host stand to try to request the manager when the hostess tells us to have a nice day! We had barely touched our food and hadn't paid for anything but she wished us well on our way out! We looked around for our server but he and the hostess disappeared to the back. So we just left. After the horrendous service and difficult parking, I will not be back.",

Waitress acted like we bothering her by asking about items on the menu- which should be expected by new customers.  Hubby asked if there was anything on the menu with a white creamy Alfredo type sauce waitress said no.  He ordered something else and I ordered shrimp and grits.  I went to the bathroom and on the wall the special of the day was shrimp Alfredo?!?!  Hubby changed order to special.    My hubby enjoyed the shrimp Alfredo though it was by no means the best he's ever had.  The shrimp and grits were GROSS.  How do you have grits that are not cheesy and half cooked to the point of crunchiness?!?!?  I have been to Louisiana and had Louisiana real quisine-and this was not it.",

    "text": "Enjoyed Easter Brunch today at Boudreaux's.  The Bloody Mary bar was quite a deal at $4.00 per glass.  I ordred the Habanerno Vodka, complete with the warning from the waitress, who said, \"be careful, it is hot!\"  Well, after I loaded it with jalopeno pepper slices, horseradish and Texas Pete, it still exhibited only a warm friendliness.  I guess that was a disclaimer.  But, it was good, and a big glass with fixins' at $4.00 is a bargain.  I also asked for the 3 egg vegetarian omelet and Charleston Cheddar grits.  The grits were creamy and delicious!  The omelet could have used more cheese, but the spinach, mushrooms and red bell pepper were very flavorful.  The accompanying fruit was refreshing as well.  The restaurant featured a nice jazz duo, consisting of trumpet and guitar.  It was just loud enough to contribute to a nice atmosphere while still retaining the ability to have conversation.  In my opinion, Boudreaux's always provides both good, reliable food and ambiance, no matter the occasion.",

    "text": "I had visited once during a visit to Charlotte and it was a good experience. Now a recent transplant to Charlotte, I thought I'd go back for the brunch available on both Saturdays and Sundays now! :-) I ordered the Cajun chicken omelette with a side of home fries. A small cup of fruit comes with it too. The meal was a disaster. The Cajun chicken omelette was flavorless, dry and hard. The contents in the omelette were not cooked at all either. Gross! I went for it anyway. I took one bite and was so disappointed. Eating it was like eating a piece of rice cake. Furthermore, my potatoes were hard. Seasoned well, but overcooked. I was going to grit and bear through my meal, but something told me to tell my waiter, Ryan. He was a good sport. He listened to my complaint and allowed me to order another meal, the Eggs Benedict with a side of cheese grits. When my plate arrived I was very excited. The meal looked fantastic. Then, it was love at first bite. The cheese grits are the best grits ever. I shared half with my sister because i wanted her to get \"the experience\". lol I ate my meal slowly so I could savor it. I literally cleaned my plate. I will return because I want to try other items on the menu, but I will still proceed with caution.",

The waiter let me know they would be ending brunch momentarily and starting their dinner menu, so we had the option of ordering from either menu. We decided on ordering lunch which included fried pickle appetizers, a shrimp po boy for him and a crawfish po boy for myself. I'm normally not a big pickle eater but I decided to try them. The pickles were fried to perfection and had they had a little less seasoning they would have been perfect. My friend said his po boy was great and my crawfish sandwich was amazing. The sandwiches were packed with meat nicely fried however we had to move our seats because there were so many flies. I was really disappointed. I felt like we were sitting outside by a garbage. The waiter never acknowledged the flies and the bees, from that I'm not too sure if I would come back. I may do a take out order if I do.",

It's almost as if they're trying to give it the French cafe look but with beads and plastic decor randomly set up in different place and instead of the live music being upbeat like the NO feel would give you, it was more so sad and somber. It was cute though and has a lot of potential to be great. I ordered the crab omelette and some beignets in hopes of it being similar to my French mother's and my bf order the shrimp and grits. I will say my omelette was surprisingly good I had no disappointments especially since I went ahead and put the hollandaise on the side( Im not a huge fan). The beignets were good but nothing compared to authentic, they were overloaded with powdered sugar like wayyyyy too much. The shrimp and grit ratio was off a lot of creole sauce, decent amount of shrimp, not even close to enough grits, and the cornbread that came with it deserves a prayer and some Holy water(it was hard and disgusting). I will say I'd give the place another try but for a Louisiana themed restaurant it def would not be for the shrimp and grits.",

Soooo, we stopped by NoDa... and I'm happy to report that this place is just as awesome as ever. I love Cajun cuisine, and Boudreaux's has such a unique menu with yummy, longtime staples that are impossible to duplicate (though we have attempted to recreate their legendary cinnamon/old bay fries back home). The atmosphere is rustic and unpretentious. And the customer service is always top-notch and down-home, not unlike the relaxed, friendly atmosphere of Louisiana itself. I'm surprised this place appears not to get more business than it deserves, but then, there are other great establishments in the area. This one, to my thinking, leaves them all in the dust. It's hard to come by really good Lousiana-style food in these parts, but this establishment does it, and does it one hundred percent right.",

I'm a southern girl and we don't play when it comes to our sweet tea, grits and mac and cheese.  I'm not a bloody Mary fan, but if you are, they have a bloody Mary bar and it's $1 off bloody Mary's on Saturdays.",

The shrimp gumbo had no flavor, the cornbread and home fries were dry and hard, the French toast tasted like it was frozen, and the eggs lacked any flavor. Maybe my standards are too high because I thought this was a Louisiana restaurant with a Louisiana flavor. It did not have the flavor of a Louisiana restaurant. The only redeeming part of the meal was the corn and crab hush puppies--those were very good.",

Our waiter was really nice and checked up on us often  The two of us decided on the jambalaya and shrimp po' boy to share:  Jambalaya- Came with a good amount of meat and seafood! but TOO SALTY. The side of cornbread was also forgettable. Dry and just whatevs.   Shrimp po boy- I liked this sandwich overall, but it just seemed like a regular fried shrimp sub. The bread was actually very fresh, and the shrimp pieces weren't small or skimpy. The FRIES though were really CRISPY and seasoned well! My favorite part of the meal for sure. I would come back just for the fries.  This was actually a lot of food for the both of us! and we left pretty stuffed Not sure I'd make my way back here though :/",

We started with the gator bites, the portion was a bit small but they arrived to the table hot and fresh. I felt they could have used a bit more seasoning but overall a great way to start the meal. I ordered a Hurricane, I love that they have a full page spread devoted to different flavors and levels of liquor for these drinks...I just with the Category 1 but it packed enough of a punch.   For dinner, I went with the Bourbon Chicken over grits instead of rice. The chicken is flash fried and the bourbon adds a nice amount of sweetness. The gumbo yaya was good, a little salty but I really enjoyed the addition of the andouille sausage.  Now, I will say that swapping out the rice for grits....was a huge win! I'd recommend doing that every time.   Overall, this visit was just A-OK in my book. If I'm in the area again, I'd pop in to try something else but I wouldn't make a special trip.",

    "text": "I love spicy Cajun food.  I love NoDa, so I desperately want to love Boudreaux, but every time I go is a disappointment.  I hadn't been there is over a year and decided to go for brunch.  The big draw, besides location, is the well appointed Bloody Mary bar they set up for Sunday brunch.  Other than that, I won't be back.  The food is bland, nothing Cajun or Creole about it, except  the names of the dishes.  I started with the Gumbo Ya Ya.  Its consistency and taste was that of wallpaper paste.  For brunch I got the special of the day- strawberry cream cheese stuffed French Toast and cheese grits for my side. ( I would have prefered bacon or sausage as a side, but was told they didn't have either meat as side offerings-really ? breakfast without bacon or sausage??) When I got my entree, the grits were touching the french toast, and the strawberry \"compote\" over the french toast was also in the cheese grits.  Sloppy.  I scrapped the grits off the main plate in order to save my meal.  The french toast was dry, and has cream cheese inside, with canned strawberries. The Strawberry compote on top of the french toast was also straight from a can.  C'mon guys, its summer- this was supposed to be the \"special\", yet there was nothing special about.  Again, bland and disappointing.  The cheese grits I managed to salvage that didn't have canned sugared strawberry sauce in it were the standout of the meal, and that's high praise from someone who isn't a big grit fan.",

    "text": "We are a tough crowd, being homesick New Orleanians. So with that in mind, we sometimes need at least a reminder of a few dishes we've been unable to make here. We've visited now 3 times, and each time we had a friendly waiter and they had Abita, and even once, Dixie in a bottle, which sent my husband over the moon (beer, for the uninitiated). Their Bloody Mary's were also pretty good. I have ordered oysters twice, once was great, the other had to be sent back b/c they were underfried. Their french bread, which they get from a local bakery, is spot on. The way it should be. Crunchy and light, not doughy and sweet. If you go, be sure to order a po-boy. It's pretty authentic. However, I would stay away from \"etoufee\" or anything that when not in New Orleans takes a decidedly tourist take on the dish. We took our children for Mardi Gras dinner, and they enjoyed it, even if the waiters had no idea why our children wanted to throw beads at them.   The atmosphere was comfortable and very New Orleans, and they had coffee with chicory, difficult to find even in the best of circumstances outside the city limits of NOLA. So please, do yourself a favor and get fully caffinated before you leave. Even if it's after dinner. It's no ordinary coffee. You'll be pleased with your pep. I give three stars -- one missing for oddly cooked food on occasion and lack of attention to detail on some dishes; one simply because I know I'm not at home when I eat here.",

We were literally the only people in the restaurant which was weird because they have a nice little patio out front that was perfect for day drinks and catching some sun.   I got the bayou bomb. Which was sweet and satisfying. Plus alcohol content was defiantly high! I got the blackened chicken, with cheese grits and cucumber balsamic salad. The grits were the best part of this dish. If I went back I would get the shrimp and cheese grits instead. The chicken was good but nothing too special. It also came with cornbread and I was very excited for this but was disappointed by it. It had an almost fake sugar flavor at the end of each bite. However nothing was so bad I wouldn't return. It was just that those things weren't my flavor!   A definite hot spot for cheese grits and day drinking on the patio!",

I was looking for great Louisiana food with much more mojo and passion to it, so it was definitely a let down visit for me.  Then again, the experience was interesting with the minimalistic dive bar type ambiance, and the food was at least ok even though too simple... Just not too much wow factor or loving soul in the dishes I received from the kitchen...   It seems there are better places to go to get more satisfying meals for the money, but if you're in this exact area and really in the mood for Louisiana style food, maybe you'll be OK if you can manage your expectations...",

    "text": "This place looked so cool from the outside, but besides that and decent service, it didn't have much going for it. The inside is not very clean, especially the women's bathroom.  For appetizer we've had fried pickles, the flavor was ok, but the batter didn't stick, and they kept falling apart. The second app was the bbq shrimp, 9 shrimp, which were obviously frozen, not fresh, on a plate of soupy sauce that had nothing to do with barbecue, and a few pieces of toast getting soggy, just swimming in that sauce. As the entree, I had the fried chicken. It was a thin, boneless, skinless breast. The seasoning was pretty good, but the bourbon and molasses flavors just weren't there. Also, a piece of meat that skinny is more like a schnitzel, not fried chicken... The rice was overcooked and the gumbo yaya (which was pretty bland and had a slimy texture) made the chicken soggy. I also had the cheese grits, which had too much pepper and were way too thick. And I mean, I needed a knife to eat kind of thick. The cornbread served as the other side was just ok, nothing special.  After the appetizers and entree, I didn't want to order dessert just so I didn't have to be disappointed.  On the plus side, it's pretty cheap. 85$ for 2 apps, 3 decent size entrees and 2 drinks.  Honestly, don't think I'll be coming back.",

Half of the food on one plate was cold, the presentation on another plate was not appealing, the waiter didn't check on us throughout the entire time we had to beg someone from the kitchen for napkins and utensils (only got 1 napkin smh). We waited another 10 min after we were done trying to eat our food for the beignets and we should have just walked out. They weren't even done and very doughy on the inside...probably won't go out of my way to try it again a 3rd time but if I do, it will more likely be for breakfast/brunch.",

She loves seafood and Cajun dishes so I thought this place would be perfect since our usual belated shenanigans kept us from seafood connection.   Got here around 8pm and it was completely empty. Our waiter was extremely chill but very friendly nonetheless. Took a minute to peruse the menus and everyone decided. I got the veggie burger with fries, my mom got the shrimp and grits and my sister, the chicken and waffle sandwich with fries. We ordered drinks afterwards and I got a brew from NoDa and my mom got the pineapple mango mojito. She enjoyed hers. The brew was a bit too hoppy for my taste but I managed to gulp down half. Not convinced it was a lager but hey, whatever.   After about 30 minutes, our food arrived. My mom loved her entree sans her cornbread which she said was hard and dry. My whole plate was cold (veggie burger and fries) My sister had cold fries but devoured the chicken and waffles sandwich. The waiter brought new fries and on my Mom's suggestion I ended up trading in the veggie burger for a couple of sides: fries, grits and salad. The salad was magnificent and I wished I had just gotten a huge salad instead. The grits were well done too (which is saying a lot being that I'm a total grits snob). I also ordered the crawfish and spinach dip after the rest which was good but really needed some salt or seasoning. With copious amounts of salt it became delicious.   All in all I would give them another shot earlier in the day but am a firm believer that if you're open, you should be able to deliver a five star experience (hence the 3 stars).",

The red beans and rice looked dried out and lacking moisture, the seared catfish was the size of a filet-o-fish from McDonalds and the collard greens, filled with stems, were obviously cooked with vinegar and lots of pepper.

The celery maintained crunch. My side of seafood gumbo was divine, but could use larger pieces of seafood.  Service: My gumbo was served at the same time as the shrimp & grits, which wasn't ideal. Our waiter was kind and referred to us as \"friends\". As in substitute ma'am for friends. It was cute. The wait wasn't too long. When we were finished, we moved to the bar, having been in the restaurant for 2 hours. The bar tender was nice and VERY patient explaining different drinks. I ultimately had wine.  Needless to say this was a great outing and I will definitely return soon.",

The service wasn't great, I had to ask for our waiter at least twice. The mimosa bar left much to the imagination and the toppings looked a little picked over; I will say that I did like that you could pour your own juice but that's about it. The place also had a faint smell to it that I wasn't fond of. Overall I probably won't go back.",

The bourbon fried chicken (comes with gumbo ya ya) is so yummy good, I get it pretty much every time I go here!! The steak au poivre that my date got the last time I went was amazing and one time I got the Cajun Carbonara which was okay but not a wow experience.   I probably should try more things but I'm not a big seafood fan lol.    It's a great place to go to before a night hanging out in NoDa.  Their seating and layout for me isn't the greatest but the staff is amazing and therefore makes up for it.  Their wine selection has let me down many times and their Hurricanes tend to be weak, however I have heard amazing things about their bloody mary's!  Overall this is definitely a place to check out though!",

The outside looked very eclectic and the inside used bright colors and cool paintings.   There were two hiccups that prevented a five stars. Our server was very polite but felt like she was new. She didn't really explain the menu and she didn't check back with us often. The second reason was the price of the appetizer.  I had the hush puppies.  They charged $7 for four. Granted they were made from crab cakes but $7 for four small balls of fried hush puppies were a but too expensive.",

Boudreax's is a nice break from the downtown Charlotte restaurant scene.  If you've never been to NoDa--you must check it out.  I haven't spent nearly enough time in this neck of the woods. I have eaten at Boudreax's twice for brunch.  Both times, I didn't leave disappointed.  However, I wasn't \"wowed\" the way I hoped I would be.  About 5 years ago, I went to Baton Rouge and had my first beignet.  My life hasn't been the same since.  The beignets at Boudreax's are nothing close to the crispy, sweet, drippy, fried dough ball dusted in powdered sugar I had in LA.  Instead, these were dry and bland. Described as \"hot pockets with nothing in them\" --the words didn't come out of my mouth.  Anyway, skip the beignets.  I do recommend the eggs benedict.  The cheddar cheese grits (extra $1) are AMAZING.  Yes.  Get those.  And the home fries are perfectly dark and just crispy enough.  The atmosphere is very laid back and warm.  There was live music when I was there which was a nice touch.  I prefer Cajun Queen to Boudreax's, but then again I have only dined in for brunch.",

Our table was cleared at the end of lunch, and we tried to flag down our waitress for the next 10 minutes to pay the bill, and finally had to stick an arm in front of her to get her to quit ignoring us.

    "text": "Hubby and I went here last night, because I saw a shrimp po'boy that was in New Orleans on t.v. and had to have one. So I turned to Yelp to find the best options for a Po'boy.  Well Boudreaux was close to the house, so we decided to go there. When we arrived, we stood at the front desk for about 5 minutes before we were sat. There as only two people that was working the floor that night, the bartender and the server. There was about four or five tables including a party of 8-10, so I think that there should have been at least another server on the floor.   So was in a hurry and very distant, which did not bother us much since he did provide great service and besides we were ready to eat anyway without all of the extra details. Of course I ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy and my hubby ordered the Blackened Bleu Burger. After ordering, it was about 15 minutes when we received our food.  First everything came out great and looked good, but my shrimp was sat on top of my po'boy, just waiting to fall off. I hate having to maneuver my food to my mouth. Three of the shrimp fell off onto the table, which I still ate and gave my hubby a chance to steal one, I just wished that they would have constructed the sandwich a bit better. Also a little spice would have been great . The fries was fantastic!! My hubby burger was good too, and the pasta salad was just meh, nothing special.  Overall the food was good, but nothing that transferred us to New Orleans.",

He as the manager should have been looking at the customers while he stood there talking and should have noticed we were being neglected. Then some other guy brought out the desert we ordered at the same time we ordered our meal. He just placed them on the table and walked away before I could ask for more tea. Finally our waitress that had cigarette stained teeth came back to ask if we wanted one check or two. I told here I needed a to go box for the desert and wanted more tea. I could not imagine choking down the desert without nothing to drink. She put the desert in a box and gave us the check and still no tea.

The menu fails to mention anywhere on it that it has any sort of meats in it. Being a pescatarian, it's surely not something I would like. The waitress was nice to address bringing out another side but at that point I was just done.

I had a few bites of my friends and it was out of this world! I ordered the sea bass special and when I asked for a side of sauteed spinach, our server was happy to ask if the kitchen could do it. They, of course, could! Our server was super fun and Quick!!! My friend said the hurricanes were pretty awesome! If you go check out the hurricane menu. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Stopped in here one Saturday after a few drinks at the Blind Pig with my girlfriend and her friends.  I was blown away by the assortment of Hurricanes they offered. There was a good portion of a page devoted to them.  Naturally,  I chose the strongest one of the bunch.  Sadly,  what i received was the worst hurricane I had ever had.  I would prefer the premixed Bacardi stuff over this.  I'm sure it had a lot of alcohol in it,  but it was sweet past the point of overkill and was quite hard to get through.  My girlfriend got a bloody mary and after trying hers, I ordered one immediately.  Boudreaux's more than redeemed itself with their bloody.  One of the best I have ever had.  The food was good,  but I would like to see a little more soul and love put in to it.  I would come back in a heartbeat for the Bloody Marys and would definitely try another entree.",

Kind of a cold sparse atmosphere! The Bloody Mary bar wasn't ready for a few minutes, and it was the best part of the experience. The waiter was also great. However, the food was mediocre at best. The shrimp and Tasso omelette had about six baby shrimp, no ham that was advertised, and barely any cheese. Breakfast wrap was mostly scrambled eggs, not a lot of flavor at all. Overall, pretty surprised at the good rating it has. Not sure I'll be back, unless it's for 1/2 off Bloody Mary's!",

The thought was that we could grab a hurricane and then come back when our table at Cabo was ready.  Needless-to-say we never made it to Cabo whenever we went to Boudreaux's.    The ettoufee is my favorite here... great and unique spot for Charlotte.  Haven't gotten to try a lot of the menu items yet, but I will definitely be up to the challenge of getting to know all the items personally.  Usually for NoDa... end up parking on the street... it's worked out most of the time.  Gallery crawl nights make it more challenging, but still doable.",

We called and they were able to get us in. The servers were attentive and fast with drink and food orders. They have a very large drink menu that ranges from beer & wine to unique cocktails. Start with a Category 5 Hurricane, then go from there! They offer a wide variety of Cajun food. Most of their entrees come in two portion sizes (T'boo = smaller, Beau Jacques = larger). I went with the smaller Cajun Carbonara and it was perfect for my small appetite this night - along with an appetizer of fried pickles. The pickles are thick cut slices (not spears) and are good for sharing. Next time I would like the try the Bourbon Chicken & their gumbo Yaya. Prices are very reasonable where you can have a good sized dinner for $9-$16 on average. I will be back! Laissez les bons temps rouler!",

    "text": "Wow, how is it possible for a Cajun place to have so little flavor? Everything here was completely bland, uninspired, and barely resembled the amazing food that comes out of New Orleans. I've seriously had better Lean Cuisines than what we ordered. It probably didn't help that we came a few days before Christmas, originally planning to eat at Revolution Pizza across the street, but having to settle on Boudreaux's because Revolution was closed for the holidays. As soon as we walked in you could feel the nasty cigarette smoke in the air (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fwedoitforlove%2F4385694117%2Fin%2Fset-72157623503537096%2F&s=039b6845fe2a986e80f8d1250f204035a549f779a93d1eae8c43c63bb488e985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/wedoit...</a>), I definitely do not miss that about North Carolina restaurants.  After waiting well over 10 minutes, someone finally came by our table to bring us some water, but they didn't take our order. We waited another 10 minutes to at least see a waiter, and I finally got impatient, went over the bar, and asked who the hell we could give our order to because we had stuff to do besides sit around in an empty restaurant. Apparently there was some confusion over who was supposed to take our table, and instead of figuring out which of them should do it they though the best course of action was to ignore us completely, not smart.  Since we were already delayed a good bit due to the slow service, I decided to only get one appetizer for the table, the gator bites. I really love the flavor and texture of gator when cooked properly, and my mom or Nicole had never had it before, so I wanted them to try it as well. The pieces we got were pretty miniscule (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fwedoitforlove%2F4385694465%2Fin%2Fset-72157623503537096%2F&s=7dd2fe202db989d99d11cb88ad77a30d26b2d875fc84989bd8a2dd90b29ff7c6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/wedoit...</a>), and the plate as a whole wasn't much in size or appearance. They basically charge you for novelty, and then make it as generic as possible. In fact, the pieces were so small, some bites wound up being more breading than meat, really sad. The cajun \"mayeaux\" was also far too creamy, and too much mayo and not enough cajun.  I ordered the shrimp and crawfish etouffe as my main lunch item, as I generally love anything cooked in a good roux. This was another tragic failure. The shrimp were not cooked properly, and the crawfish was virtually missing. The roux was a sloppy mess (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fwedoitforlove%2F4386459240%2Fin%2Fset-72157623503537096%2F&s=9e4a36acc29673e926642389a9df9fd228ec7580ee5a024e4a858353bc13e176\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/wedoit...</a>), and even the cornbread was doughy instead of crumbly. Worst of all, there was NO flavor, it tasted so horribly bland. Etouffee is supposed to be one of the crown jewels of Creole cuisine and they butchered it.  My mom ordered the blackened chicken salad, which sadly was probably the best thing at the table, but unfortunately it too was still lacking any solid flavors. How you manage to cook something \"blackened\" and leave it devoid of any charred or spicy flavors is beyond me, but it looked like they just rubbed some red pepper on and prepared it normally.   I didn't even bother trying Nicole's oyster po'boy, because the baguette was completely ruined (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fwedoitforlove%2F4385695997%2Fin%2Fset-72157623503537096%2F&s=4d044f2b2eeb7af8910d2d45502139e31400b78d7f766e5f5a81282736f216dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/wedoit...</a>). The bread was practically crunching off like charcoal with each bite she took, and the oysters themselves were tiny and fried for entirely too long. The fries were edible, but overcooked as well, and probably sitting for a while because they weren't very warm.  How much of this horrible meal was due to it being Christmas week and them probably understaffed and under-enthused about having to work I'm not really sure, and I honestly don't care. If you're going to be open you should treat every day the same, and give customers the same quality of service you normally would, otherwise give everyone a 50% discount for your 50% effort.",

Must order for the table: the beignets.   Back to the important things, this bloody mary bar- they have several different vodka infusions (habanero, rosemary garlic, cucumber basil). The spread on the bar itself is also impressive- homemade bloody mary mix, various squeeze bottles of juices (pickle, okra, olive), veggies. They do it right here.   It's NoDa, so parking sucks. Be patient and look for a spot on a nearby street. Make sure to pay attention to all the parking signs and don't block anyone's driveway.",

(So before I get into this I just want to say that I am a server myself) so ever time the roles are reversed and I go out to eat I am always empathetic and optimistic, but this was the worst service I've had in a very long time. It took a very long time to get our waters. Our food took over 20 minutes to come out even though the place wasn't busy at all. I walked around so About 5 other tables. My boyfriend ordered the $17 Seafood pasta thinking it would be filling especially for the price, but it was actually soup.   **They should give you a plate to discard the shells and tails so you don't just place it in the table. The servers should communicate and explain the dish when someone orders it so that there is not any miscommunication   I tried to convince him to order something else since it was not what he was expecting but he just wanted to eat it since he was very hungry at that point and just wanted to move on with the night. I ordered the fish and grits that was very good I would recommend it it has a very good flavor. The cornbread on the other hand is dry.   Im sure going there for brunch is better but the dinner experience was extremely disappointing",

Nothing to go too crazy about. With the front wall/bay door(whatever you want to call it) being open, a good amount of cigarette smoke travels from a nearby establishment. That smell is consistent and can be aggressive at times.   Went for the experience because the wife mainly wanted to go.. but with so many other resturants in the area, we will likely try them out rather than returning here.",

We were the only ones waiting and she told a couple after us that they could go to The sanctuary which is the same kitchen, so I was confused on the wait. We were seated not long after & our server Noel greeted us and got our drink order. They had $3.5 mimosas so we both got a double. She brought us the champagne then we had to go get the juice and fruit to out in it. We stayed clear of the fruit as it didn't look that good and probably was sitting all morning. The juices looked to be sitting out all morning as well and weren't cold or in anything to keep it cold. I went for the canned white grapefruit juice. For food I ordered the Foghorn Benny, the chicken cutlet was cooked prefect and the waffle was good too. The sausage gravy that's supposed to go on top, I asked for on the side and it was very bland. They had run out of home fries so I went with grits and they were bland as well. Won't be back for brunch. But heard they have a good Shrimp PoBoy so May give that a try.",

The flavor was pretty good on the alligator bites and fried pickles but the batter just crumbles off. The pickles really just feel apart after touching them.   I had the blackened chicken from the lunch menu and it was awesome. A good portion for a chicken breast and super juicy. The season was heavy but that is the idea, very good. For sides I went with the Charlston cheese grits and French fries. Grits weren't hot but warm enough to eat. Decent flavor but super stiff. The fries could have used an extra minute in the fryer, flimsy and floppy but again good seasoning.   The reviews about the corn bread are spot on. It's one of those moments you just need to sit someone down and say... just stop. At least serve some real butter while it's \"hot\" so the dryness can be remedied with the butter... maybe.   Over all the basics need work. Execution is the flaw here since the flavors really are good. We went for lunch and it was super slow so maybe a dinner when things are moving in the kitchen would mean someone was paying attention.",

The fruit looked like it was leftover/out awhile cause it was dried up the juices were warm which made the champagne warm so we had warm mimosas.   Food was okay. I got chicken and waffle sandwich. Waffle was dry and crumbly but the chicken was good.   The second time we went was worse. I don't think they staff it enough because all the tables were full and I only saw one person and a bartender working so our service was really slow. The table next to us walked out after not getting greeted for at least 10 mins (they walked out after 10 mins)  I got the Eggs Benedict. My poached eggs were hard boiled, the hollandaise tasted like plain melted butter and the ham was a joke. I think the piece was maybe 1/2 inch wide by 1 inch long.   I won't be back mostly because I can find better brunch options super close to this place.",

Maybe they're not done remodeling yet, but the current state is not cool. More importantly the food has dropped in quality. The shrimp in the jambalaya was like bad small frozen shrimp that weren't even deveined. Needed a pooper scooper. I think I'm done going there. Wife had shrimp and grits and that was disappointing too. Maybe it was an off night but I can only judge my experience. I hope they get their mojo back.",

    "text": "Have been to Boudreaux's a few times and get the fried gator tail appetizers and the chicken fingers & fries basket each time. Not an exciting dish for some, but it suits me just fine. Gator tail? If you are not from Florida, then this is not your everyday menu item. If I said, \"tastes like chicken\"; would that be too much of a cliche? Well, it does, it's a mild flavor that anyone can like. I went with a vegetarian and she managed just fine. The food is decent and the prices are reasonable. The restaurant suits the area and is pretty big so it can handle large groups of people.   I think my only gripe is the service is a little slow. The last time I went, there were only about 4 tables of guests and we still had to wait a while for our meal. If you are walking around Noda and want to try a new place, then stop to Boudreaux's. It's very visible corner location is inviting and you can hit a few pubs after dinner in Noda before heading home.",

This was my first visit and I had never had gumbo or jumbalaya.....so I would say both dishes were delicious!!! We had a party of 12 and all enjoyed the dishes. My favorite was the spinach crawfish dip (and I don't like crawfish). Kudos to Shawn and our server Quan who did an excellent job at accommodating a large party who had difficult requests on a busy night!",

I had the seafood gumbo (that comes with cornbread) and the alligator bites. The alligator bites are amazing, however, it might be the only overpriced thing on the menu ($10 appetizer). The seafood gumbo was dee-licious! For dessert, I had the bread pudding! AMAZING! I had a mimosa to drink with my meal. I was visiting from NJ and was extremely pleased with the food. The service was equally wonderful. I had a waitress named Stephanie who is an enabler haha! But I'm glad she convinced me to get the bread pudding. This place has good food, great service, and is priced right. Def check it out. You won't be disappointed!",

I stopped by for dinner late on a weekday night and ordered the Cajun Carbonara, which had the perfect amount of heat without detracting from the wonderful flavor. My date, who was more acquainted with Cajun cuisine than I, had the Low Country Shrimp & Grits. He absolutely raved about them, and the bite that I tried was just as flavorful as my own meal. I'd happily eat it, and I'm not even a shrimp or grits fan! The cornbread that came with each meal was pretty solid, but not the best I've ever had. I will say that the service was a little slow, but they were very kind and I had no problem waiting. The portions were pretty huge, so don't feel shy about boxing it up!  EDIT: Alright. It's sad, but I had to drop this review from 5 to 3 stars because I'm fairly sure my boyfriend got some serious food poisoning from the questionably \"shelled\" shrimp in his shrimp & grits. (I can further confirm this because I only had a bite of it and had a lesser bout of food poisoning myself the next day.) Just be wary of what you're eating, folks - even if it IS delicious.",

None of them acknowledged us.  The hostess finally came back to her stand and seated us right away.  There were some people sitting in the side rooms but we were sat in the front room. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I forgot her name unfortunately!  We ordered some cocktails and they were well made.  The gator bites tasted really good and weren't chewy or overcooked.  I liked that you can order small plates so my sister and I ordered a small plate of etouffee and a house salad to split.  It had good flavor, not the best I've ever had but not bad either.  My other sister had the crab cake croissant and I felt it was waaaaay too salty.  Fries on the side were good.   One thing that really put me off about this place was all of the flies inside.  We had 3 circling around us the entire meal and it was really annoying.",

    "text": "Went here with a born and raised low country boy. He wanted me to point out that they do not have Dr. Pepper and he wanted me to start this review with that information.  Parking: It's NoDa, so it's either street parking or you hope they have a small lot with spots. We went here for dinner and parked in a lot (by the cafe) across the street. I do not know if we were suppose to, I was looking for a sign saying yay or nay. If you live in / near the neighborhood, walking should be nice as the streets are vivrant and good for people watching.   Food: So I chose to go here to get his opinion of True Louisiana cooking. He always raves about it being back home and obviously it entices my appetite. So I looked for soulful Louisiana, creole southern restaurants in town...and hopefully get the \"tastes like home\" kinda reaction out of him.  We ordered the Etoufe and the Jambalaya as entrees and the Shrimp and Crawfish dip as appetizer.  He really enjoyed the Shrimp and Crawfish app. It comes with flat bread and chips. He preferred the chips. The Asiago cheese paired well with the salty/sea taste of the shirmp and mudbugs. I really enjoyed it, his note is that he wished there was more crawfish in it...  Etouffee. Hasn't won him over, it was ok for him, but nothing to rave about. It tasted good, gravy (sauce?) has a nice body of flavor, rich that just got soaked up by the rice, but nothing to compare it to traditional Etouffee. I liked it.  I ordered the Jambalaya. Yum! He really like the sausage and said it's a really good sausage. The jambalaya had shrimp and crawfish too and it was creamy rather than a tomato soup sauce that paired well with their rice. I would recommend to order this over the Etouffee.  Service: They had only one server, he was attentive, but with the whole floor in for dinner, had a little waiting going on, but like I said, he was by himself (aside the kitchen staff and bartender) so he had his hands full and did the best he cane. It was a Sunday night. I saw the menu for brunch - perhaps that I will try next time and perhaps is their fully-staffed time. They have traditional brunch items with a Louisiana twist.",

They had pictures up on the wall of Louisiana. The waitress was extremely helpful, patient, and just overall great customer service. I got jambalaya as I usually do at these type of restaurants. The portion was small but still a great taste if I ever were to ever come back. The jambalaya was cooked well, but just well nothing dazzling that I couldn't find in any other city that wasn't New Orleans. I would definitely go again to try other dishes or enjoy some drinks. They had great seating areas and this could be a great place for a date or day with friends. You will get great service, a good meal, and a wonderful setting.",

It was not a bug but it still put a bit of a damper on the rest of my experience. The waiter was super nice and replaced it immediately with tons of apology. The poor guy- He felt terrible when he brought our food out and 2 of the 6 dinner plates hit the floor before he could serve them. YIKES. So two people in our dinner party pretty much sat and watched the rest of us eat. When their food finally came out it was hot and delicious (according to them). The restaurant did comp their food and offered them a free meal on their next visit. That was freakin awesome!    My meal: Bourbon Fried Chicken with simple Yaya rice. I also added a side of red beans and rice. The chicken was amazing. Flavor was great and it was fried perfectly. The yaya rice was also flavorful. However, the red beans and rice was just ok. I will pass on that next time.   Overall, I will visit again.",

Our waitress was sweet, she seemed to be the only one working so service was a bit slow.  We started off with dessert before lunch and ordered 3 beignets (mistake)- ended up ordering more- the 'pile' of beignets which comes with 7! They are delicious! He ordered the shrimp and grits and enjoyed it. I ordered the veggie burger with a side of mac & cheese.  The veggie burger was really big and the presentation wasn't the most attractive, but it got the job done. I can't say that I would order this again because it was a bit dry and bland.  The mac and cheese was okay.  As a plant based eater, it is quite difficult to enjoy Cajun cuisine, as most of it contains meat in some way, shape, or form. Would recommend to my meat-eaters friends, pass for non-meat eaters, it ain't for everyone.",

We agreed to wait and 20 minutes later the server came over with another excuse on why they were not ready we just agreed to get fries. The food was actually pretty good. When we were wrapping our food up my friend looked into her water to take a drink and saw a penny at the bottom of her water. She did not see until the ice melted. She let the server know and he told her that she was lying. At that point we had enough. We paid for our food and most likely will not be returning",

But I will have to say i feel like this place is a little underrated. I am not saying that it blew me away but I feel like this place deserves a little more recognition as a good restaurant then it has gotten.   First, this is a Louisiana style restaurant. It had a casual and relaxed atmosphere that is fitting for the NoDa neighborhood. There was a live guitar player which we thought was a nice touch.   The food was pretty good! Not knock your socks off good but still good! We order the beigets, which were delicious and by far my favorite of the food we ordered. We also got chicken and waffles and the eggs Benedict both were quite good. But the Charleston grits that we got as a side were so so so so good and worth the $1 upcharge For those looking for a boozy brunch this place has a great deal! Half price Bloody Mary bar and $3.50 mimosa bar   Lastly our waitress was great. The waffles on the chicken and waffles were very over cooked and instead of us having to point it out to the waitress, she came over to us and said \"that does not look right let me get you a new one.\" And the second time around they were much better!   Overall, this was an enjoyable experience. And will probably come back. Our meal was was pretty good, but those beignets.....yummm!!! Can I got a box of those to go?",

I wanted to make a day of exploring NoDa with this restaurant on my to do list. The restaurant has had a noticeable facelift since it's early days and that's a great thing. It's a welcome change for the eclectic energy of NoDa. Walked right in on a perfect Sunday afternoon and was seated inside but outside, away from the sun but still feeling the breeze. For a Sunday it was pretty empty, the feeling was nice. In my opinion, when places are empty the food is usually better because the Chef can take his time preparing the meals as opposed to rushing when the place is jam packed. But let's be clear, if this place would've but crowded, I was still going inside to experience them. They have drink deals everyday and Sunday was half off Mimosa(3.30). Ms. Jasmine was our Server, she is pretty and smiley and polite!! Kudos for that because hospitality plays into how I rate the establishment as well. Ok so food was scrumptious.!!!! I wanted to try the gator bites but I punked out. I'm usually a chic that tries anything once. Definitely next time. I ordered the Catfish and Grits and that was my first time ever eating baked catfish, well it was a welcoming surprise. Delicious till the very last bite, seasoned to perfection and the grits were just right. Super smooth. For an appetizer we had the steamed shrimp and my GF order the fried chicken with Jambalaya. The chicken was great with the best crunch of that damn skin. Whewwwwee weeeeee!!! The Jambalaya was a bit tart with the tomato sauce, felt like it should've been a little spicy to combat the tartness but it still was pretty decent. Oh and they have a drink called The Hurricane which you can order in categories from 1-5. I had a 3 and it was semi-strong but did the trick!",

Bloody Mary bars are wonderful because I can and will make a killer bloody mary when supplied with the right ingredients. They have several vodkas to choose from including a pepper vodka which is great for lovers of spice. There are probably 8 different bloody mixes to choose from, including a great house mix. There are hot sauces galore! And so many pickled vegetables to throw in, not just olives. The best thing is they'll have your vodka ready so once that clock hits noon, it's on.   The food at brunch (because I've only eaten here during brunch - prime bloody mary hour) is aiite. Standard omelettes and other things covered in hollandaise sauce. Have yet to try their beignets, but have heard great things about them.   In short - when it's bloody mary time, Boudreaux's is my number one.",

    "text": "I was really excited about this place based on personal recommendations and yelp reviews. I've heard the dinner is amazing, and with such a high rating level, knew this would be a great place to take friends from out of town. However, we decided to go earlier in the day instead of for dinner. Went for brunch with 3 other people. Now, I understand that Charlotte is still working on their brunch scene compared to other cities, but brunch is brunch! The food was cold, and service was slow. Our waitress was really friendly but very relaxed. She was attentive when it came to our coffee, but would disappear in bouts of 10-15 minutes. It wasn't very busy. The food was good, not great. I got the Breakfast Burrito. It was cold, and the cheese was hard. My friend really enjoyed the Shrimp Omelette, but did mention it was luke warm. Could be an attribute to our waitress performing Houdini disappearing acts.  Overall, this place is good not great for brunch. It would be a place that if I had to have a fourth or fifth option for brunch, I might think about trying it again during this time. As to other times during the week/night,  I'm not giving up on this place! I've heard their Shrimp And Crawfish Etouffe and Bloody Mary Bar are as authentic as it can get. I will be back for dinner!",

I had the Monte Cristo sandwich.  Soggy bread, the taste really didn't flow, too many things going on. My girlfriend had the Croissant Florentine and she really enjoyed it.  I might go back and see if it was just what I ordered, but more than likely I will try other places first",

This is a really great little casual place.  I don't know why I never came in sooner.  I came here for date night last week and it was really nice.  Our server was on top of things, super helpful and constantly refilling water.  (Sometimes, I drink water like a mad woman).  The jambalaya has a little bit of everything in it; chicken, sausage, shrimp, craw fish.  It's amazing.  It's one of the pricier things on the menu, but a million times worth it.    I need to come back here for the hurricanes.  An entire menu devoted to them?  Yes please.  I'll update my review after that!    See you soon, Boudreaux's.",

I attributed that to the location and the fact that they have to carry the food up the stairs and around the corner to get it to Upstage.  Well tonight proved 2nd time is not the charm.    Drinks - Girlfriend ordered the special, a Poinsettia, it tasted like olives.   I ordered a diet Pepsi.  I complained that it was flat to which the friendly waitress said \"yeah someone said that last night too - I think we are out of carbonation\"  WTF?  Really?  She replaced both offending beverages with no complaints.  Food - overpriced and very very greasy.  The hush puppies were good, but not worth the 7 bucks.  My ribeye was fatty..fattier than it should have been.  The potatoes and asparagus were also covered in grease.  Girlfriend got the gumbo (just a cup)  she said it was good, but her entree was also all butter/grease.  I will not be back.  Bad experience.  Waitress was nice, but it speaks something about the establishment when a full 24 hours after they discover an issue with carbonation at the bar, that they A) still don't fix it and B) continue serving carbonated beverages.  Yuck.",

Thankfully my idea that all cajun food contains these is misguided.    On my last visit to Boudreaux's with the dinner group, I had the Cajun Carbonara and the she crab soup.  The soup had a nice spice level to it as was as the pasta dish. The disappointment I had was that it looked like the pasta was the pre-cooked rotini version importanted from your favorite food service company.  But it was still good.  The service was good, the drinks tasted good and were not weak like some places make them.  Unfortunately, it was a lot of food where 1/2 of my meal went home in a box with me.  But it tasted good the next day also.  My only surprise was the restaurant wasn't busy.  When I called for a reservation at 7pm, they told me they had another big group coming in at that time and asked if we could go 15 before or after.   But when a friend and I arrived early for drinks, that group had the only tables (2-3) occupied in the place.  Oh well it was still good, we were still served and we still got out before that group.  I just found the request odd considering they weren't busy.",

    "text": "Me and one of my friends visited Boudreaux's last month after an evening yoga class in the neighborhood.  It was a rainy, cold Thursday evening, so the place wasn't busy.  Unfortunately, we were immediately struck by the VERY THICK haze and stench of cigarette smoke.    My friend ordered the black-bean veggie burger with a side of potato salad and I ordered the shrimp po'boy with a side of fries.  We were both shocked by the large portions of both of our meals.  The seasoning on my fries was a tad stronger than I like but not overwhelming.  The bread was lightly toasted and very thick which made eating the sandwich a little difficult.  However, my friend commented on the fact that her veggie burger had the texture and taste of a regular beef burger! Also, she noted that her potato salad was very satisfying and delicious.  Although our meals were very enjoyable, having to deal with the thick stench of smoke put a major damper on everything else. Also, our waitress didn't appear to be all that interested in providing much service to our table.    I hear good things about their brunch menu, so I would be willing to try them again during the day. Hopefully, the next time I go it will be on a nice day so I can sit outside and not have to worry about cigarette smoke interfering with my meal.",

The gator bites were interesting and came with a great sauce, but were more of a novelty than anything. The she crab soup, although just a tad too sweet for me, was delicious and the crab flavor was evident. The freakin shrimp and grits was like a creamy flavorgasm, and the ettouffee was just as incredible. They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients like crawfish and shrimp, and the seasoning was perfect. Beignets were very similar to what we had in NOLA, although a bit more chewy (which we liked). Would definitely come here again, and recommend to everyone.",

    "text": "While visiting with some dear friends in North Carolina over the Labor Day weekend,  we were delighted to be introduced to the NoDa section of Charlotte, despite the torn up sidewalks and make-shift potable water lines resulting from the recent discovery of the soil contamination.   The four of us sat down to what seemed was to be a nice dinner at Boudreaux's.  Our waiter was friendly and enthusiastic.  We placed our order drink, along with four appetizers.   Our alcoholic beverages arrived in a timely fashion.  We waited for an extended period of time for the apps, but were so busy chatting, that it didn't seem to be much of bother to us.    Finally, the waiter arrives with our plates.  DINNER plates, that is.  Perplexed, I ask \"What about our appetizers?\" . He, looking completely stumped, replies \"Appetizers?\" .  In turn I reply \"Yeah, we each ordered an app!  We ordered them along with our drinks.\".     Then, you could almost see the light bulb go off in his head (almost)!  He remarks \"Oh no!  Oh, boy.... I forgot about them.  They've been sitting up on the counter.  I didn't realize they were for me.  We're really short-staffed tonight and I'm swamped!\"     At that point, we told him to forget about serving them to us as we all had our large meals, but he was insisting to bring them to us (not comped).  Two of us gave in to his urging and so he brought out my friend's She Crab soup (eh) and my alligator bites, which were of really poor quality, and I doubted their authenticity.   In fact, I picked the thick, mushy breading off a few of them and I unveiled a couple of pieces of crawfish!    We wondered why the waiter felt \"swamped\" as the restaurant was only at about 60% capacity on this Saturday holiday night.  When wait staff makes a big blunder like that, they should really ask permission from the manager to make it up to the patrons by offering free dessert or removing an item from the bill to compensate.  But, no- we were granted so such gratuities.  My Charlotte friends won't be going back there anytime soon.",

Served with some cornbread, i had enough leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. My friend had some spicy noodle dish, i can't remember the name.

    "text": "I was trying to figure out why I haven't written any 1 star reviews. I realized one reason is I don't want to feel responsible for a small business going under. Another is I'm pretty good at avoiding places that are likely to be a 1 star experience.  And as a rule I usually find some redeeming qualities like value or service. But rules are meant to be broken.   Enter Boudreaux's.  The first visit I was excited to try their etouffee because I love cajun food and like the etoufee at Cajun Queen but alternatives are always great. First we had to wait about 50 minutes for our food and after it came, I thought the etoufee was awful and the taste was bland. Perhaps I should have gone with the jambalaya or Shrimp and Grits, though none of the people enjoyed their meal. However, the meal just got worse when the server was pouring my sweet tea (apparently above me) and poured half a pitcher of sweet tea down my back. The server was off in Lala land or might have been on something because it took a chirp, or yelp if you will, to get him to notice that there was something wrong. So he then stood there and said \"Oh whoa dude...\" ... and so then I had to ask him to get a napkin or towel or something.  \"Oh, sure.\"  I don't make a big deal of things, so I laughed off the tea and apathy and attributed it to having a bad day.   Then Mother's Day came around and I wanted to give it another try since it's an institution that has been around NoDa forever. They were having a brunch and I realize most places get overwhelmed for Mother's Day brunch, but this was truly amazing. The food took 2 hours and 20 minutes to get to us and was completely cold by the time it got to us. Really?? Really. So all we had during those hours waiting was weak bland coffee. They offered to remake the food, but I was worried it would take another hour or so.  Quel desastre! I usually give places 3 tries before I'll review a place but in this case after 2 visits I will unequivocally never go back.    So if the food had been exceptional, sure, I would compensate the stars to make up for the terrible service, but it wasn't, so I didn't. I hope I never have to give another 1 star review again. It just makes me feel dirty.",

They make up for that with tons of specialty drinks, most were yummy and fruity for the ladies.  I would definitely try it again.",

The restaurant reminds you of a \"modern shack\" you might find near the shores of the Louisiana Bayou.  Multi-colored beads are hung all around with a chalkboard eloquently displaying current specials.   That morning there was a lovely jazz duo playing some tunes which complimented by $2 mimosa quite well.  We ordered the shrimp and grits, tasso ham and cheedar grits.  My shrimp and grits were pretty good but the chef could have went easy on the amount of celery and onions he put in there.  Either way, it came with a lovely wine sauce on top of the creamy grits.  Shrimps were plentiful and were plump and tasty.  The tasso ham was so flavorful that I wish bits of them came in my shrimp and grits.  Cheddar grits were good but let's face it, it's kind of hard to mess up cheddar grits.  There were a mix of people there including a table of what appeared to be college-aged kids with a really loud female in the group.  Luckily they left about 15 mins after we arrived.  There were also families and couples.  Real cute.  This is definitely a nice spot to take a date when you're getting to know each other (fellas, hint, hint!)  Service was quick and cordial.  The manager will come out to make sure you're doing good which is always a nice touch in my opinion. After you're done eating, go check out some of the nearby boutiques.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, I really did.  I had heard good things about it and was looking forward to going there, maybe I just built it up too much.  Maybe I hit on an off night.    The decor was pretty cool, if a little random (local art is great, but not everybody likes nude portraits while they eat).  Overall it was funky and I liked the bar area, but what the hell is going on with the toilet paper hanging from the ceiling.  It's hard to think of anything less desirable than to feel like you're in a giant toilet (think trainspotting).  Maybe its to make it feel like a dive bar, but leave that to EB's.  My real beef, however, was with the food, I had the she-crab soup and crawfish etoufee.  The soup was spicy but didn't have any depth to it, just kind of hot for the sake of being hot.  Same thing with the etouffee, peppery but no real flavor.  And I know people are going to read the cabo review and think I have OCD, but the etouffee rice was either dried and hard or uncooked and hard.  For god's sake people it's not difficult, I cook rice all the freakin time.  If it's hard, don't send it out!!!  People don't want to eat that!  I'm at the point where I'm just going to boycott rice altogether, it's going to be tough, my sushi choices will be limited, but goddamn it, this is what it has come to!  Do you see what you've done people?!?!  Are you happy??   Sorry for the rant, back to the review:  All in all the service was good, the people were friendly, and I would go back to drink and probably give the food another shot, just hold the rice.",

Plus, with Mellow Mushroom gone, there just aren't all that many restaurants in NoDa anymore. Still, Boudreaux's is really good. I often get the blackened burger with blue cheese. It's pretty delicious though the very onion-y bun is kind of overwhelming. The New Orleans/Mardi Gras-themed restaurant is a fun place with a good vibe. They also serve up a good brunch menu.",

I ordered the Jambalaya as usual and for some reason it was much more more runny and kinda oily. It had the texture of something that would come out of a cafeteria bin that was mass producing food for hundreds as opposed to a freshly made dish. I also ordered the gator bites to start with and they were a complete joke. The \"bites\", as they were called, were mini fried pieces of batter and hardly anything more. I'm not kidding when I say mini either. Probably half of them were as small as or smaller than even a M&M piece of candy. The real kicker was that our waitress was sporting some serious attitude. I get it that I'm just a lowly customer and therefore I am to be regarded with what can only be described as restrained content but at least try and phone it in a little. Just really upsetting to have such a crappy experience at a place I have always loved and tried to talk up to whoever would listen.",

Among the faculty at Virginia Tech, Boudreaux's was known as \"The Best Restaurant in Town\".  And truly, a big bowl of their seafood gumbo at that location was a pretty satisfying thing, though nothing to write home about.  In Charlotte, though, they have a lot more competition.  I was in there recently and had corn chowder (thick and cheesy) and fried oysters (I know, right?) and rolled out feeling kind of bloated.  Anyway, my feelings about Boudreaux's are mixed, but they're pretty convenient if, say, you have to pick someone up at the train station and get them something halfway-decent to eat right away and it's after 9.",

Entrees took at least 40 plus minutes after the soups came out.   Monday lunch hours arrived at 12:15 and ran out by 1:45 to get to our meetings.   One of my bosses said his soup was a little cold.

Me and two others were seated and our drink orders were taken, and shortly after our food order. After 15 minutes of waiting patiently for our drinks, our server Nate (bless his heart, he needs a new career), comes back to the table to explain that the drink ticket was lost and our drinks would be out soon. 2 minutes later, came back to inform me that the beer I had ordered was out and asked if I wanted another drink, at which point I ordered a bloody Mary. About 10 minutes later, a table of 8 just beside us, is asking for the manager. They were seated after we were informed our drink tickets were lost, so I guess we must have been patient. After asking for the manager and explaining their drinks hadn't come out yet, I couldn't help but speak up to explain about our 30 minute wait of no drinks...the table of 8 immediately decided to leave after that.   We then explained to another waiter about our wait, and Nate, our original waiter came back to apologize. A couple minutes later, our appetizers were brought out, and still no drinks.   We were sitting close to the bar and could see 2 beers sitting there for 10 minutes. Nate even picked them up, as if he was going to deliver the 2, but put them down and thought otherwise.   After a wait of 40 minutes, our drinks were finally brought out.   At no point was any attempt made to correct the situation, only excuses about being understaffed and busy, although the place was half full at best.   So I leave it at that, my belly full and satisfied, but annoyed at my time here. If I'm back, I will be calling in ahead of time and doing take-out.",

I bring out of towners here often and they always want to come back.  The most flavorful dishes to me are the shrimp & grits and the Mulatte. It does not really have a \"scene\" but when weather is nice their little patio is cool. Always friendly staff.  I have been In Charlotte almost 15 years and I frequent this place for a solid meal often.",

I went here for dinner last night & should have known something was up due to the lack of people, especially when the other places in the area were slammed. I got the crawfish spinach dip & shrimp po boy. The chips were good for the spinach dip but the dip itself was lacking, and cold. My entree was basically lettuce on chewy bread, shrimp was minimal. My friend got the gumbo yaya and could only take a few bites before giving up. It looked like it had been dumped from a can and she said it tasted as if it had gone bad. Service was also lacking. Would never recommend this place!",

More waiting.  We finally got up and got forks and napkins ourselves.  They were quick to take our money and credit cards but took over 15 minutes to return with them.  Then they accused my party of stealing money bc they were confused and accidentally gave out the wrong bill books to the wrong tables.  What a mess.  The food was not good enough for all that.",

I ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was different than I'm use to buy surprisingly it was tasty but soupy . I also ordered the Seafood Gumbo since I don't eat pork and all of their gumbo had sausage in it.    I also ordered a Hurricane Category 3 which was very interesting. It's the typical hurricane but their spin on it is to add additional shots and increase the category so I was told a category 5 would put anyone on their butt. I ended up with the 3 which was made perfectly and tasty. I'll go back again to try a 4 and later a 5 .  Our Waiter Quan was very attentive, nice and welcoming so he received a great tip. He was very helpful in asking the bartender about the hurricane categories and also the kitchen on a few concerns about sausage not being included nor cross contamination with the shrimp.  I ended up spilling my drink (promise it wasn't bc of the category 3 lol) but Quan was very nice about cleaning up the spill and still provided amazing service. Thanks Quan for a great experience, I'll definitely be back to try a few things.",

Confession #2) we peeked in and there was no one in Boudreaux's at the time - it was bright, empty and I didn't want to feel like I was on display in a fishbowl, so we ordered and had the food delivered to Sanctuary. Holy Yapple Dapple Yabba Freakin' Doo! Tasted like they have been stewing/cooking those beans all day long - jam packed with flavor and spices. Nice consistency to the rice (not overcooked). Let's not forget the sausage - nice portion with just a little heat. Great choice of eats for a pub crawl or foodie crawl. If I remember correctly too, it was under ten bucks. Will definitely be back to try the Jambalaya that Kelly C raved about!",

However the kitchen service was very meh. Half of our table got food while the other half had to wait another 15 minutes and the others already had finished eating by the time we got our food. When going to speak with management, they did not apologize for the wait or try to even see what was going on and not even an incentive for the VERY late arrival of food. It wasn't that busy so that excuse is not a good reason. Then when the food arrived the home fries were very hard and my omelet was greasy (like as soon as I cut into it juices started flying-yuck). Safe to say I didn't finish all of my food and I will not be coming back here to spend my hard earned dollars until the kitchen staff and management figure out what the issue is. I only gave 2 stars because the server did his best and kept checking in on us and he actually APOLOGIZED. Signed a Foodie of Charlotte.",

She Crab soup   Everything we ordered was pretty good. My favorite was definitely the Fish & Grits, the fish was blackened perfectly in my opinion. I'm not that big of a fan of black peppers but the pepper flavor was not overwhelming at all. So if you like that spicy pepper taste, it's probably not for you.   The sausage that came on that gumbo was sooooo good!!! If it wasn't on the gumbo, I probably wouldn't order the dish again because I'm more of a jambalaya fan.   She crab soup is also very good, I appreciate that there isn't a fishy taste or smell to it. Very well seasoned.   Honestly, all of our orders came with cornbread and the dish was better off without it. It was outrageously DRY and flavorless. Not wanting to sound rude but their cornbread will NOT be missed if they stopped serving it, that's how bad it was.   Service was good considering, we were the only people there in the restaurant but we did go 4-5pm during a work day.",

As my group was walking by Boudreaux's for lunch this afternoon, Alex came out the door to say hi to us and tell us it was good to see us. I will absolutely be back and looking for him!   I've read a lot of the reviews and I feel terrible because I have to disagree. We were only perusing the outdoor menu when a waiter appeared in the window in front of us, opened the door, and informed us that they were having $2.50 mimosas and half off Bloody Mary's. That sold our group of 5. We were seated immediately by Alex and I have to tell you, he was so personable, he's the main reason (tied with taste of food) I'm writing this review.   Alex immediately took our drink order and recommended appetizers. We ordered mimosas, gator bites, bacon fritters, she-crab soup and corn and crab hush puppies. The gator bites were smaller and there were only 4 hush puppies but none of the apps were lacking in flavor! They were SO delicious and we're shared among 5 people amicably.   As far as entrees go, we ordered jambalaya, etouffe, red beans & rice, shrimp & grits, and muffaletto. They were all spot on and hit every spot we could have imagined.   My favorite part of our hour and a half dinner was our waiter Alex. He should be requested every single time you come in! Thanks for such a great experience!",

Was in Charlotte for a family reunion. Was hungry and excited to find this place. Was just in NOLA in July. This doesn't compare.",

    "text": "So driving around, lost in a new city, we fell upon this place! Not busy at all around 1pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday, but the music was pleasant and Cajun food, always a must! The place was very clean and service was genuine. Our server gave us some great recommendations and even gave us some idea of the area and even days where they had specials per our taste.   The menu for alcohol was pretty cool. They had a section for category 1-5 hurricane drinks, which our server also said was half off till a certain time. Caught my attention. It had different descriptions for category 1-5 rum drinks which varied on strength and liquors. I got the cat 2 because that was the strength of hurricane Matthew when it hit us in charleston just the week before. It also had info on around 5 hurricanes that hit Louisiana  in the past and had names specifically for those and personalized concoctions for those hurricane drinks. I've never seen this on a drink menu, I really enjoyed it, went along with the theme of Louisiana!  For the food! We only got appetizers because we stopped in between house hunting. We got the BBQ shrimp and the bacon jack fritters. When I read BBQ shrimp, I automatically think of BBQ, southern BBQ, sweet with a little spice, but this was something completely different. In a great way. A buttery Cajun spice mix, not spicy, but flavorful, and the shrimp were a decent size as well for an appetizer. The bacon jack fritters were a surprise as well. They seemed to be fried but not greasy at all, which I always worry about with fried appetizers. You get around 5 pieces and the sauce is what really gets your attention. I'd eat that with any type of appetizer, Parmesan cream sauce. Yummy yummy.   We definitely will be back to try out the dinner options and enjoy some of the nightlife!",

We spent it wandering the nearby neighborhood and were only accosted by one \"upper class\" beggar who wanted \"a dollar toward a vegetarian burrito, man\". Love NoDa!  We started with the \"Gator Bites\" - a small plate of battered and fried alligator tail. Despite living in South Florida for a decade, I've somehow managed to miss out on this delicacy. Tender and rather buttery, you should give it a try.  For our mains, I chose the day's special - a half-rack of St. Louis Ribs which came with an ear of corn and cole slaw and fries. I cleaned the plate. I love ribs and these were particularly fall-off-the-bone. My date chose the blackened steak, which she said was cooked perfectly and the side greens were excellent.  I would have thought that after a meal like this we would have been stuffed solid, but our lovely waitress managed to convince us to share a bread pudding and cappuccino.  Great meal, great service, great date. We will absolutely be back!",

Cornbread--the sweet kind. Actually could have used a bit of salt to enhance the flavor. I grew up having cast-iron skillet cornbread, dense and crusty and not a hint of sugar. Love sweet cornbread, but as a fan of kettle corn, my ideal now includes both tastes at once.   The service was kind and leisurely. I was sad that the beignets are only on Saturday and Sunday...note that the mimosas are cheaper on Sunday.",

    "text": "Being from California, I always look forward to an opportunity to get some Soul or Cajun food when I'm in this part of the country so Boudreaux's seemed like a good choice.  While walking up to the restaurant the neighborhood reminded me of the funky shops and unique flavors found on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, CA.  Far from scaring me away, this was an endearing throw-back to home.  Across the street it was Hookah night  and the sweet tobacco scents drifted in the air.  As I shoved tightly folded dollars into the parking pay box ($3.00 which suprised me in an area so far from uptown) I noticed a fun looking book store on the back side of the restaurant.   When my dining partner and I walked in we were seated quickly although the waiter seemed a little brusque (in fairness he did appear to be the only wait-staff that evening).  I finally settled on Ettouffee, Rice and of course corn bread.  I was suprised to find that the potent spices and flavors that usually accompany this dish seemed to be lacking.  The meal was fine, but a little bland for my preference and the cornbread was actually a little dry.  If you prefer milder Cajun cuisine, this might be the spot for you.  If you're looking for something more authentic... keep looking and let me know where you find it!",
