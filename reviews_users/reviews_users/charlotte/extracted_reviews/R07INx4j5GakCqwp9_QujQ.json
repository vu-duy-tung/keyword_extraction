    "text": "First problem was securing a reservation. Trying over a 3 day period unsuccessfully by phone and unable to leave a voicemail cause it was at capacity and finally forced to go in person. The online restaurant website only allowed customers to reserve for advertised events when I only wanted to secure a seat for brunch. Maybe use an online system like Open Table to accommodate all events. Second, music selections. Either play jazz for a jazzy brunch or have a DJ. Having competing music play simultaneously is too much. Mute the tv screens and let one genre play. Pick one music theme and stick with it. Having a baby grand piano with an unskilled vocalist was torture. Third, clear communication between hostess, servers, bar and kitchen. If you no longer carry a brand then provide alternatives. You cannot have a drink menu with items you are out of and have the waitress run back and forth to inquire. Making Moves is a drink special calling for rye and ginger beer and out of two of three major ingredients. Communication is key. If you are out of something provide alternatives in advance to servers so recommendations are lined up and things go smoothly. Presentation is everything and proper plating is necessary no matter who the chef is. Ordered the fried whiting and Grits and received a plate with congealed grits (it sat so long and had cooled off) with whiting served skin side up instead of the meaty part being displayed. My friend and I asked to provide some feedback to the chef, JR Robinson. He came, listened, apologized and offered to make us something else. He singlehandedly saved brunch. There are growing pains but the entire staff must work in tandem with the chef as customers support the face of the establishment which includes service, food and ambiance. My hope is they will thrive and grow and I firmly believe they will!",

    "text": "FOUR WORDS: LOBSTER MACARONI AND CHEESE. Literally. The best fried lobster tail I have EVER had!! Omg. I had to FaceTime my mother & BEG HER to come & try this item!! (we pride ourselves as black women who jokingly make the best \"Blackaroni n'Cheese\" ever..) Aside from the wonderfully light & crunchy batter on the lobster (which was insanely moist & fresh despite being fried) the mac n'cheese was like a Gouda/Cheddar blend or something!!? Amazing. I went on a Thursday night so it was Wing Nite. My friend & I felt obligated to order because half priced... & tried the Jerk BBQ (charred style). Those were pretty gr8 (I'm enjoy a Pescatarian diet so my love for chicken, in general, is pretty weak nowadays) but if you love wings: you'll be impressed. $5 Hurricanes & $3 draft specials honestly made the entire experience incredible... but the SHOW STOPPER ?? I begged the bartender to bring the Chef out (in a strategic attempt to successfully guess what was in the cheese sauce) and he actually came out before the end of our meal to indulge my compliments & playfully jealous sentiments on being a MAN capable of knocking a mac n'cheese out the park!! Wonderful service, cool energy, live DJ after 9p... STATS is a nice time hopefully here to stay!!!",

    "text": "We visited Stats for the first time tonight. It's a nice space in the Davis Lakes community right off of W.T. Harris Blvd. The restaurant is very large and can easily accommodate big parties. It's sports themed with a a lot of floor space (could be a dance floor), multiple TVs, and a large bar. Our waitress was nice, she mentioned she normally doesn't work there but was just helping out for the night. They seemed to lack servers and hostesses when we got there but that could be because we arrived shortly after they opened their doors. There is no Kid's portions which was disappointing...Nonetheless we placed our orders. The kitchen was slow and there was a long wait time to receive our food. I had the fried fish sandwich and fries...both were good. My kids shared the Fish & Chips: the fish comes drizzled with a orange colored sauce that they did not like but I was able to wipe it off. My husband liked his chicken sandwich and fries. Both sandwiches came on a brioche bun (which I love) This spot has a lot of potential for future success. I would recommend making sure they have enough people in the kitchen to move orders out more quickly and ensuring that they have enough servers. I'll definitely be back to check out again in a few months!",

I've been a waitress and know from first hand experience that she didn't have a hard time helping a party of five. Also, she seemed unapologetic about the multiple delays and I think it was because she knew she was getting a 18% tip anyway. She didn't write our orders down and kept forgetting what we ordered. Awful. This is the last time I'll ever come here.",

The staff and customer service was great, the hostess was very knowledgeable about the new venue, the menu, and the events that were going to be coming. The menu is simple but a lot of great choices. There's not much on the menu but it's just hard to choose because the options are great.  I chose the chicken and waffles with a side of the cheese grits. The chicken breast was cooked to perfection, very juicy! The waffle was a great compliment to it I enjoy'd the berries that the actually added to the dishes will great plating. The grits were amazing creamy stone grits with just the right amount of cheese. The proportion sizes of all the dishes are great for the price. My friend ordered the fish and grits which she enjoy thoroughly. Our waitress, Gabriel, was very knowledgeable about the menu. The staff actually has eaten everything on the menu so they're able to tell you recommendations, which was a great plus. Overall I give this place a thumbs up love the atmosphere love the ambience staff was great.",

Finally I asked another waitress who was not attending out section to assist. She did and she later explained it wasn't the other waitress's section. I asked whose section it is and she was not sure. I asked why didn't she simply let me know as well as coworkers so an order could be placed. Of course unable to speak on her behalf. I was immediately upset and baffled. Later, the food came, dj continued to spin great music but because of that incident, not sure I'll be back. Service is everything",

While there was miscommunication about the event. We ended up sitting at a table on the upper deck and ordering food off the late night Menu. We were a little irritated that we didn't get a menu when we sat down. And we waited a while for one (5 mins) and even longer for waters unfortunately. The several waitresses we had prior to being assigned to us were trying to be helpful. The place is REALLY REALLY NICE ascetically. From the lighting to layout and decor it's very trendy sports bar! The late night menu is only the left side, which is primarily everything but entrees. The menu doesn't have many options (at all) and is pretty basic. My friends got wings. He said they were salty and they looked better than they taste. The other friend got wings as well- he said they were basic nothing spectacular. They messed his order by putting salt on the fries when he asked them not too. There was a woman who- I'm assuming was the manager -made sure they corrected his meal right away; While the waitress tried to take his entire plate away the manager woman made sure he got a fresh batch. The waitress had a lot of patience and kindness . I don't eat red meat so when I asked if I chili's get chicken cheesesteak fries she made it happen. Overall, great atmosphere- okay food- awesome service!",

    "text": "So this may just be my new favorite restaurant/bar/lounge. I loved almost everything about this place, from the service to the food to the music. My cousin and I arrived around 11 p.m. We found two seats at the bar and within a minute or two were greeted by a very friendly bar tender. My cousin and I ordered tequila mixed with orange juice and the bartender was was not stingy with the tequila. We were only there for about an hour and a half but the entire time the bartender was friendly and attentive, which is the main reason I will be back. We ordered two orders of wings and I also ordered their famous lobster and crab mac n cheese. The only thing I will say about their lobster and crab mac n cheese is that I did not see or taste one bit of crab in the it. However, the fried lobster tail that they place on top was hot and super good along with the creamy mac n cheese. The wings were good too! All of our food came out fairly quickly and was piping hot! I feel the food and drinks are reasonably priced as well. For two orders of wings, lobster and crab mac n cheese, two tequila and orange juice drinks and two double shots of tequila, the bill was $90. I would say that's a really good deal! The music was also EXACTLY what I wanted to hear, a nice mix of old and new. I also loved the mature crowd! One last thing I wanted to mention was the customer service. From the security to the ladies at the front desk to our bartender, everyone was so friendly. That definitely stood out to me because the customer service at establishments these days leaves MUCH to be desired. I will definitely be back!",

I tried to start off with an appetizer of fried pickles, but after our food came out, the server asked me did I still want them (I'm assuming she forgot) and I said yes. Never received them. Then I ordered a double shot with a chaser or diet on the side. It took 3 more trips for her to bring me the chaser. I order a chicken philly, which was good, but I had to wait 7 minutes for her to come back with the proper condiments and silverware before I could begin to eat. Then the server complained that she was paying all the attention to us, as if it's our fault that she couldn't just write everything down at once so she's remember it. The drunken apple cheesecake was delightful. The food itself was great, the service just could've been better.",

    "text": "As it's only been open a couple months, it's not a surprise that tonight was my first time visiting the restaurant and bar. What is surprising is how good food could leave such a bad aftertaste in my mouth.  The service was fairly good, although the server didn't know what beers were available on draft. As there were only six beers on draft, I'm thinking he might want to brush up on his memorization skills. But he was very attentive, when asked for anything from anyone (extra napkins, another drink, silverware for new arrivals) he always brought it promptly, and he was very likable. I have no complaints about the service.  I ordered the Curveball Club Sandwich. The description made it sound like a normal club sandwich, but instead of a traditional club served on three thin slices of toast, I got a turkey and bacon sandwich served on two thick slabs of Texas toast.  To the preparer's credit, the meat and toppings were arranged evenly across the entire sandwich. As anyone who's ordered a sandwich anywhere from Arby's to the higher-end chain restaurants can attest, that's unusual. Most of the time, all the meat and toppings are plopped in the middle without a second thought. So I appreciate the obvious care the preparer took when making my sandwich.  But I wasn't expecting a turkey and bacon sandwich on very thick toast.  It had a good flavor - the turkey and bacon were both very good - but after finishing most of the first half of the sandwich, I realized there was no cheese in the sandwich, even though the description of the club specifically mentioned cheddar cheese. It's funny, because even after adjusting my expectations upon seeing the non-club club sandwich, something felt off, but I was too busy talking to my friends to notice there wasn't any cheese at first.  I asked the waiter if he'd bring me a half a slice of cheddar for the other half of my sandwich, as I was planning on bringing it home to eat later. At that point, I felt like it would be silly to put some cheese on the remains of the first half of my sandwich.  A couple of minutes later, he came back to the table and told me there was no cheddar cheese available in the kitchen, but he could bring me a slice of American cheese.  The restaurant had been open for less than an hour. It was not busy. I can't imagine why they did not have any cheddar cheese. The restaurant is located maybe a couple thousand yards from a Food Lion, and maybe a half mile at best from a Harris Teeter, and they had no cheddar cheese. This is a restaurant that offers cheeseburgers. And they had no cheddar cheese.  Evidently, they named it the Curveball Club because it wasn't actually a club sandwich and it didn't contain the cheese promised in the description. Randomly bizarre, much?  With all that said, I have to say I wasn't unhappy. Again, the service was good, the food was good even without the cheese, and the people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals. In my mind, I was already composing how I'd describe the thick toast and lack of cheddar cheese to my friends later when describing my dinner.  BUT THEN I GOT THE BILL.  I was planning on giving this restaurant three stars. I don't think it's the greatest, but it's not the kind of place I'd normally eat in anyway, and while the lack of cheese (or rather the explanation for the lack of cheese) was weird, it wasn't a bad sandwich, even if it wasn't a club sandwich.  But I ended up being charged $23 for the meal - $5.00 for each of the two beers I drank and $13.00 for the sandwich. It wasn't until I got home and thought about it that I realized they had overcharged me by $3 for a sandwich that wasn't even what was described. The menu said it was $10. I verified on their website that it's $10. But they charged me $13.  I could live with that - it's only $3 - but then...  They also tried to con me into paying a tip twice.  They charged me a $4.14 gratuity. That's standard - most restaurants charge an 18% tip for groups of six or eight. But on the final bill, the one you write the tip in and sign, there was no mention whatsoever that the subtotal included that 18% gratuity charge. Instead, there was a tip guide letting you know how much to tip on a total that ALREADY INCLUDED AN 18% TIP.  I paid $29 for a moderately good sandwich and two small draft beers.  And then they want to try and trick me into paying a second tip.  So yeah, I'm not giving them three stars. I'm giving them one.  And if you have a problem with that, you can pay the $9.90 tip I would have given if I hadn't been paying attention on an overpriced $23 meal. (That includes the $4.14 tip charged automatically since I was part of the group and the $5.76 recommended tip I would have paid if I hadn't checked the original bill and seen that the tip was already included in my subtotal.)  That's some devious crap they're trying to get away with.",

They have a limited brunch menu which is good.  I ordered the fish and grits with butter crab sauce according to the menu, but when it came out I didn't see any crab even though the picture on their instagram page clearly shows crab but I was told it's just a sauce and if I wanted crab I had to request it.....um, ok.....crab please.  That combo of fish, grits, and crab was superb!  Creamy grits, perfectly seasoned fish, and lump crab.....no words.  I also tried the chicken and waffles, it was pretty good but the waffle was soft which I asked for it to be crispy.  I was impressed with how good the food was and will be returning soon.",

Jazz music? They need to pick a theme and stick to it.  The decor was classy and then they have tacky fake grass as a carpet.  I get it.  Supposed to look like a football field. But it just doesnt match.   I hope it lasts though.  It was pretty empty on a Friday happy hour which is never a good sign.   They should advertise to all the business parks near by. Especially Wells Fargo and IBM drive area. Better signage out front would help. The sign is not very visible from the main road.",

We were given a time for the doors to open ..to only be standing outside for an additional 30 mins. At most places if you get there early there is at least a couple tables to claim on fcfs but not here. We were told the cheapest table was 250 and up smh. Everyone knows women need to rest every so often. They chose to let around 10 tables sit empty all night instead of given them to paying customers. Yes i said paying cause we still paying at the door. I believe customer service should be your no 1 priority instead of the celebrities and money. They opened the doors at 9 and the celebrity dj didn't come out until after midnight. I chose to leave right before. If you take care of people your business will last a long time. This place has changed ownership so much. I really hope they do better in certain areas. I probably won't attend another event here.",

The event was supposed to start at 9:00, me and wifey got there about 8:30 thinking we were going to be late. They had us and hundreds of others standing out in the cold (freezing) for an hour or more and they were letting people just walk up to the front of the line and didn't do anything. Once we got in (think goodness we came early) seating was very limited and a free for all. Some folks (like us) were being seated and a lot just ran to table's and sat down. The food we ordered was pretty good and came to the table pretty fast. Our waitress was very attentive and checked on us often, she gets  stars for her service . Dougie Fresh put on a good show, Kid Capri was cool and I was very disappointed in Biz Markie. I grew up listening to Dougie and Biz Markie and they were among my favorites. Just expected a little more from Biz .",

The lady at the waffle station seemed to be having a difficult time as well watched several time she had to start over. We opted out of the buffet as I'm not a fan of buffets and it seemed like they needed some more time . I did order the fish and grits minus the sausage. The guy beside me asked about my meal and told his waitress to order him the same thing but they unexpectedly hooked him up with crab meat so I felt a little slighted lol  .

This is a great place to go grab a bite to eat with a group or even by yourself if you please. There's a bar for you to order a nice drink and you can even order hookah to smoke. This is a great spot to watch football on Sundays.   When I walked in for the brunch I was greeted by a pianist. She was singing as well. This really set the mood for an upscale restaurant . But when I stepped further in and got comfortable I realized that it was actually a laidback atmosphere.   I really enjoyed myself and even thought the food was delicious! I ordered the fish and grits and they served me a big portion, so big I was able to share! The service was also very good as well! The waitress continuously asked if everything was ok, so I was pleased with that!   When I looked at the prices I thought it was rather pricey but when the food came out I then realized you definitely get your moneys worth! I can't wait to visit this spot again!",

Decided to give this place a try for brunch on a Sunday, because there weren't many cars in the parking lot so I figured the service would be swift and I would be in and out. Eh, I was wrong... but not entirely. Upon entering the restaurant, I like the fact that they've aimed to keep it themed with the name, as the area around the bar has football field markers. I also enjoyed the the pianist that provided music until it was time for kick off.   We were seated quickly, but it took us a little while for our waitress to acknowledge us and get our drink orders. It took about 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive and about 15 minutes for coffee, because it had to be brewed first. I was little confused, as it was brunch time, so I'm not sure as to why coffee was not one of the first things ready... but I was grateful for it when it came and didn't feel the need to complain since our waitress was nice.   We ordered our food and waited...during this time we noticed that a couple of people that came in around the same time as us, but sat at the bar, were pleasantly enjoying their meals. The elevated area we were in was not crowded but I only counted 2 or 3 waitresses, which should have been enough but there obviously was a lack of urgency with getting food orders out...not sure if that was on the kitchen or the lackadaisical of the servers. Our waitress, aware that we were now going on 30+ minutes waiting, didn't see the need to swing by our table to update us on the status of our orders. I think continuous communication is important, especially with new establishments. We finally received our food... the presentation was great but the taste was just OK. I ordered the chicken and waffles, but the chicken was meh.   I will have to try this place out again, maybe for dinner though. Overall, I look forward to improved efficiency from on service side of things.",

The TVs were all around but could be turned up a bit because  the DJ would randomly play music during commercials it was a lot at times when your trying to talk.  The atmosphere was good",

I put last in quotations because I am quite unsure that I will be able to resist going back, lol! Any who! Let's get into was ordered! A friend and I ordered three items: the beef empanadas, the fish and grits and the lobster mac and cheese. The beef empanadas were perfectly seasoned and crispy, we didn't get a chance to try the sauce (we scarfed them down before realizing the sauce was in the bag! Lol), the fish and grits were amazing!!!! They reminded me of home (Charleston, SC) the fish perfectly seasoned and crispy, the grits creamy, and the crab added a perfect touch. The lobster Mac and cheese, lawd! I was so mad I didn't order them myself but I tried it and needless to say I will be back for that!",

I ordered the fish tacos with a side of Mac and my friend ordered the sliders with fries. The food was basic to me nothing I would crave but maybe something i would grab if I was in the area. The drinks were good though so def a good spot for your bar preferences.",

I asked for manager and Mgr came over she said she would assist and the Mgr never came back. I finally got a call to say they had a table but when I came to hostess stand no one came over. So we had left. I have been to Stats many times and I usually like it but a word of advice for management you need to train your staff better whether I'm a man or woman I should be treated the same.  It will be a min before I come back to spend my money.   I'm only putting one star because it didn't let post w/out doing so.",

    "text": "Went here to watch the fight. Got tickets specifically for the fight. We arrived early because of the potential to not be able to find a park. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. The drinks were decent but we did notice that the more people that started to come in around 10pm, the glasses got smaller. I promise. I wish I would have taken a pic to show the difference. My take from that was if you want a standard size drink, you need to get there before 10. Anyway, we ordered fish and wings. The fish was plentiful. The wings were drenched in honey BBQ sauce. My boo got a really bad stomachache from eating them. Not sure if it was the sauce or what. But we could not stay for the main event because she was sick from the wings and needed to go home. The fish and fries were pretty good. I didn't like how they drizzled the aioli all over the fries but otherwise it was good. The price was pretty reasonable for the type of place that it was.   So this place is definitely a nightclub and not a sports bar. At no point could we hear the fight. Only able to see it. So please keep that in mind. The music was loud and there are people dancing around you while you are trying to watch T.V.  After sitting there for about 3 hours because we were eating and watching the game. We were told our table had been sold and we had to get up! So I guess if you are at a table and don't order anything after a certain amount of time you have to go stand up. I had never experienced anything like this but okay.   Overall it was a cool place if you are into the night club scene but if you want to go chill and watch the game, this place is not it.",

Popped in for brunch to see what the hype was about and in sum the food was bomb but the service left much to be desired.   We arrived around 12:30 pm (they open at noon on Sunday's) and was greeted by a pleasant young lady that directed us to the bar because \"there are no servers here for y'all to get a table.\"   Me: \"ookkkayy?  So we head over to the bar where we are again quickly greeted and asked if we wanted a bar seat or table. We explained what we were told by the hostess and then we were redirected to a high top. On the way over the manager? stopped to tell the hostess that she had a server available. We were handed off to the hostess who led us to the table mumbling something about forgetting there was a sever.   We were seated and observed that we were the only two ppl in the space with the exception of one other person and two small children. Their mother was our waitress and after several moments she came over and got our drink order. We ordered everything all at once because hunger. We waited a longer time than expected for our appetizer to come out and the entree and for refills on water and for the table to be cleared etc. To be fair our waitress was very nice but I'm not sure if the issue was that she had other tasks to do in the kitchen or she was watching her children in another room or what but all the waiting is why I'm not giving this place at least 4 stars. Well that and the nuances like: the we don't have takeaway cups because someone ordered the wrong size, the dollar store \"steak knives\" that were so flimsy I actually considered that I may injure myself trying to cut my chicken, it was freezing (but that could be just me)  The food was very well seasoned and the music was great. I would try this place again. Maybe during the week. Hopefully the service is better.",

Like until you see me attempt to leave out the door how dare you accuse me of not paying my bill. It was very embarrassing to say the least. I'm not going to hold poor judgment of one of the waitresses against this place because their chicken wings are just too good to never not go back haha but seriously I do really like this spot & id probably go more often if it wasn't so far from where I live at.",

I ordered a house salad minus croutons with extra Caesar dressing on the side, Southwest BBQ (turkey) burger minus bacon and the drunken apple cheesecake.   When my salad came out, it was ranch dressing and not Caesar. I had to request my extra dressing. That was Caesar, so I had two different salad dressings. The drunken apple cheesecake was disappointing. It tasted like regular store bought cheesecake with apple slices and a thin sauce. I should've gotten the banana pudding cheesecake LOL. The fries were room temperature.   What was good about the food was the southwest BBQ turkey burger. They weren't stingy with The amount of cheese and I'd never had onion rings on a burger before,  but I'll def do it again. It was SO good!  The music was entirely too loud and it was dark. My friends and I literally had to yell to speak to each other.   I honestly think they're understaffed. I felt sorry for our waitress because she was ripping and running the entire time. Despite that fact, she was super nice and apologetic for our delay. It took one of us 45 min to get our food. Everyone else at our table had already eaten. I felt bad for her.",

I went there today for brunch and a promised performance of Uptown Swagga at 4pm.  The band did not start until 6pm and in the meantime the music playing was so boring.  The lights flickering off and on. They are very short staffed and the manager needs to whip them into shape. Very disappointed today of the lack of professionalism and this business all together.",

That was a disappointment since a lot of guest (like me) were from the DMV and really wanted to see them perform. There was only 1 bartender that took orders as the only server as well. She was very nice but slow service. Employees came in late to work as we arrived. No one seemed prepared. Guests were seated outside on the patio that were never served. They ended up coming in to be waited on. When the food finally came it was good but barely warm to the touch and it was brought out to each of us separately instead of serving the table as a whole. The hookah bar had employees smoking as well as patrons!  Unprofessionalism all around. The lounge/bar needs new management. It's large and has a lot of things not working properly. It needs the right person to make it a great establishment.",

Upon ordering we were not told only certain drinks are on special. When we received the bill we were charged over 10.00 for the drink. Told the server and soon after then manager came and told us that they not certain drinks are on special and the server told us that. We explained to her that we were not told and that is not the advertised as certain martinis. The food was good as were the drinks. However they need to be clear when advertising.",

I saw Chef JR in DC endorse this establishment when it was opening and was happy to see something similar to what I'm used too.  I'm moving from the DC area so I was excited.  We Paid $1000 for a table for 6 people that came with two bottles.  Not bad at all given it was a busy weekend in Charlotte. The folks at the door was hooking their friends up and folks with tables stood out there for 45 minutes waiting to get in.  The group next to me was from Atlanta and they too were like nah this wouldn't be happening in the A.  I know it wouldn't happen in DC.  You pay for a table you get in period.  A lady who looked in charge came and put a stop to that.  We get it and it's a futon couch and a coffee table from Ikea that didn't fit 6 people at all!  We talk to a manager and she kind of blew us off.  The space was so small that it was ridiculous.    After the initial hour mess we did have a good time and I ordered the pasta dish which was good because they were out of lobster mac and cheese. This establishment seems it can possibly be nice if they treat customers a little better than taking their money, standing out in the cold and a BS coffee table and small futon.  Treat your customers well and they will endorse you.  Treat them like shhhh and they won't return and tell their friends of the horrible service.  Word of mouth is a powerful thing in business.",

I will definitely be going back soon so I will capture it then. But there are other pics here that capture it. We sat at the bar which was perfect.

The 1st time, the tail was sent out dark and  appeared fried too long. I sent it back and realized that it wasn't that, the darn grease needed to be changed. It was DISGUSTING! Last night, I tried to give it another chance and it wasn't good at all. Everybody can't cook seafood and whoever has been cooking it lately really needs to be trained.",
