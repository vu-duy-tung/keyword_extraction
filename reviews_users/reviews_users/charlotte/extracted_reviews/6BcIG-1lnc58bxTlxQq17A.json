The chips are homemade and delish, and they have a choice of 3 salsas: a chunky tomato and onion mix that's closer to pico di gallo, a traditional red salsa with cilantro, and a fiery green salsa that they'll bring if you request more heat, which is perfecto. The fishbowl margaritas come with fresh lime and the food, pretty standard Mexican fare, is what you'd expect: hearty and tasty, if not especially healthy. A reliable bet.",

    "text": "Tres Pesos.....not even worth un peso!!!!  On Cinco De Mayo 6 ladies were looking for mexican cuisine and got no utensils to eat any of it with!!  To not be able to serve us any drinks the entire night and have to wait so long that we were about to get up and walk out (some people did) was a disgrace.  We finally had to get our own drinks, own utensils and had to find our own food!  The manager said that he'd 'take care of it'....what that meant was get us a \"free drink\" that we ended up having to pay for in the end!  They could have made a lot of money out of us if they had only paid attention to our empty drinks.  Half of our food was not brought out but of course they tried to charge us for it.  Then when we wanted to pay and get out it took them an hour to put it together.  Of all days the manager decided to train the girl on our bill.  Then to add salt to the wound we were charged an 18% gratuity with our bill...and this may have been because they knew they did not deserve it and would not have gotten that much had they let us decide what to give them.....un peso.  In all honesty the food was worth about 4 stars but the service is not even worth one!  Service is what makes the experience and this was the worst.  Azteca was busier than this place and we probably could have gotten a seat, had awesome food and left the same time we ended up leaving this place.  I would avoid at all costs!",

That said, they seemed QUITE AVERAGE & I noticed nothing that wowed me at all. There were the usual chips & salsa (two kinds) brought out before the food.  Had lunch with a friend and ordered the grilled \"large\" chicken quesadilla. Hmm...quite plain actually, I was kind of surprised.  The only thing on/in it was cheese and chicken, with a VERY small smattering of lettuce and tomato along the edges of the plate; more decoration than anything.  Asked for the sour cream to be on the side but that didn't happen - slightly annoying but not a huge deal.  I mean overall it was ok, but there just wasn't anything TO it for $7...fairly cheap but I was underwhelmed.  I've had much better quesadilla's as appetizers at non-Mexican restaurants...and made much better ones at home if I do say so myself.  Ok, so is TP a bad spot, no.  Is it a place I would make an effort to go back to, NO.",

While recently visiting the Tres Pesos, service was not ideal; below average with the waitress ignoring most customers while disappearing for most of the time we were there. Too bad--that would at least be worth +1 in star-ratings. Overall the food is not what I would call incredibly delicious or superbly authentic. I am not a Mexican foodie but, at the very least, I believe I know good food when I taste it. This was not the case. I would guess they make most of their money from the lunch crowd--local business execs and other salarymen--looking for a bite to eat between cranking out spreadsheets and inarticulate powerpoint slides.",

    "text": "I love authentic mexican, tex-mex , and ultra-fresh anything good food.  I noticed Tres Pesos across the street from my all-time favorite Azteca and thought let's give it a go....   Ummmm, won't make that mistake again...  First of all, we were seated, given chips and 2 kinds of salsa's (ehhh).  The music was so loud we could not communicate with our server. After asking no less than 6 times to have it turned down, I finally walked around to find a place in the corner and had them move us there.   The three of us asked what was recommended, best on the menu, etc and sampled each others dishes. We did try a variety of items on the menu including the \"House Especiales\" & highest priced stuff too.  We persisted, tried to enjoy ourselves and finished our selected items. Damn, if this is their best...  \"Did you see 'Bridesmaids'?\", I asked  my friends. I had a weird feeling. Then the movie scenes I had been refusing to think about began to replay in my mind, this time, I wasn't laughing.  Although we escaped living out the Bridesmaid's movie scene, I hardly call that a successful dinner.  All in all, this was a bad experience... maybe worst ever in my life.  In my personal opinion Charlotte has had a reputation over the years (been here since 2000), as having a knack for doling our mediocre fare but this was bad, even for Charlotte.   We had a pre-paid gift certificate that was refused and then after an hour of the staff telling us the manager wasn't there, there was new management and the whole \"We don'ta understanda so good b.s.\".  They finally gave us a partial credit. What a load....  If you are smart, DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE... EVER!!!",

I thought it would be a relatively quick transaction; however, it took over 10 minutes for my to go bag to be brought to me. The chips were hot, salsa was pretty good, the cheese dip was average. Unfortunately, 4 days later, I check my online banking to see that my card was overcharged $5. After I had already tipped $2 for a TO-GO order! Unbelievable. I will definitely not be returning. If you do stop in, be sure to check your bank statement!  EDIT: After speaking with the owners of Tres Pesos after this incident, they did everything possible to ensure I was taken care of. I was returned the full amount and actually spoke with the owners several times to ensure everything was taken care of. I plan to return to give Tres Pesos a fair review. They definitely provided some of the best customer service I've seen from a restaurant and went WAY out of their way to make sure I was happy in the end. Thank you!",

We were immediately served hot tortilla chips with an excellent fresh salsa.  I could eat that salsa every day.

While the front of the house is cute enough, the main dining room was just depressing. After we were seated, our waitress came over and scowled at us! No smile, no hello, just the ol' stink eye. To break the tension, I asked about the margaritas. After ordering drinks, we sampled the salsas, which were so bland and nondescript we ordered guacamole. Which was also flavorless--and not fresh. There was virtually no distinct taste to anything--at least nothing strong enough to distinguish one dish from another. We ordered combo platters so we could sample a variety of things but the only variety was in the texture of the different items. The margaritas were salted with table salt and tasted only of bottled mixer--I couldn't detect any tequila whatsoever on my tongue or in my brain (16 ounces of margarita should provide a buzz!). I will never stray from AZTECA again!",

Now I know why we were seated immediately at Tres Pesos. No one came to greet us for a good 20 minutes after we sat down and after our very unpleasant server finally took our orders, our food took TWO HOURS to get to the table. This might have been understandable, except the two tables on either side of ours were seated after us and had their food before we did.

    "text": "No.  Just.  No.  I work relatively close to Tres Pesos and years ago we used to visit at least once a month until the server's skirts got shorter, tops got tighter and boobs got boobier.  While I am sure the tips increased dramatically (the clientele was almost only men on our last visit a while ago), the food just got worse and worse, so we started going across the street to Azteca, where they now scream \"Amy\" when I walk in and make a place at the end of the bar for me (not really, but we do go there more often than we should).  Trying to try new places, and give old places another chance, I stopped in at Tres Pesos for lunch today.    The interior, while it hasn't really been updated, seems to be different.  It looks like they maybe did some renovation and moved the bar?  I dunno.... The waitresses were fully clothed, which may be why the place was practically empty at 12:15.  I sat down and needed some chips.  The chips were warm and delivered immediately, though they seemed a little greasy.  Served with the liquidy salsa and the chunky tomato/onion/ciliantro pico (?), both were heavy on the cilantro, so I ate neither.  I ordered the queso, which to their credit is served in a small size for only $2 instead of the large bowl for $4 in case you are dining alone or not wanting to share your cheese dip.  The cheese dip was meh - very thick.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing special.  The beef chimichanga was a hot mess.  Served with rice and beans, the rice was fine, the beans were runny (not appetizing).  The chimichanga, which is essentially a deep fried burrito, was covered with lettuce and such, sour cream on top of that, red sauce and then tomato slices, which completely saturated the chimichanga and made the fried outer shell mushy.  I like the crisp, which is why I got a fried dish - if I wanted a soft exterior, I would have ordered a burrito.  Meat filling was ... not in my top 10.    Service was fine, I didn't run out of drink and that is important, but I found myself waiting for a bit for the check and then for her to pick it up.  Nothing was offensive or horrible, but overall it was just meh.  I should have gone to Azteca across the street or made the drive to Monterrey in Pineville.  Bleh.",

When I got there, I was eating alone and the hostess led me all over the restaurant looking for an empty table.  We went back by the kitchen area and through an area that looked like it was used for storage until she finally sat me at the bar.  I really didn't want to have my first experience at this place at the bar. But oh well.  Like all other Mexican places, I received the complimentary chips and salsa which were mediocre at best.  I ordered an unsweetened iced tea that the bartender couldn't even take the time to refill.    I ordered an enchilada dish and it had to be the most bland mexican food I've ever tasted.    I've never had bad Mexican food until this place and the service or lack of service made this experience one of the worst.     Ugh!",

As others have stated, it is very thin. It's flavorful, but the texture is lacking and it runs off of the chip when you dip it. Great fajitas at a very reasonable price.  The service - The waitresses are the primary reason I come there. There are a couple girls that are VERY attractive. They have those perfect, curvy Latina bodies. However, they need to smile more. They would be so much prettier and inviting if they smiled a little more and maybe sat down for a second to ask me how my day is going. I myself am very handsome me, so I would think that they would be more interested. Maybe they are shy. In any case, I'm gonna keep working on them and continue to come back :)  EDIT: I guess Yelp didn't like me talking about the hot waitresses.  I don't know why.  Attractive wait staff is the primary reason I go to restaurants...",

The other is a traditional style red salsa with cilantro and a spicy kick.  Ground beef tacos are tangy and the chicken tacos a little runny but taste great.  The real winner however was the steak tacos.  I've asked for soft corn tortillas twice and gotten white flour both times so the kitchen can be a little random.  For the price it's worth a trip, just keep your expectations aligned with the value.  How much can you really complain about $2 tacos...",

The salsa was runny like a sick 1st grader's nose and lacked salt and basic flavor.  I finished the strawberry margarita and didn't even have a buzz. It was plain and flavorless and hardly justified $9.00.  The fajitas are about the only thing I had that night with any Mexican spice. They were average at best. Not to mention the service was so piss-poor slow that I was tempted to walk five feet to the bar and get a dam beer myself.  If you go here, make sure you have plenty of time to waste.",

And you certainly can't beat the price!  I can't agree with previous reviews of the salsa. While it wasn't the way I would make it, the salsa I was served was large-ish chunks of tomato and small pieces of onion and spices. Yes, there was a good amount of water in the bottom, but the stuff above the waterline was spicy and hit the spot with the chips while I waited for my entree.  My margarita was massively huge though I'd say it probably only had one pour of tequila in it. I've never had one served with an orange and a cherry on the rim before. Weird.  The \"two enchilada combo\" also comes with a scoop of Mexican rice and a cute fried corn tortilla bowl of refried beans. It was satisfying, for being \"Americanized\" Mexican food.  Would I come here again? Sure, why not.",

The tackiness makes this place stand out on Woodlawn & the inside doesn't disappoint in that category either. While a tad bit dark in the dining area, the tables & seats are all painted bright colors all in crazy designs. While this has nothing to do with why I like the place, it does make it feel like they're trying to get you to notice.  Nothing too exciting on the menu but your typical Mexican dishes, but the lunch menu prices are on point. You can come in hungry & leave full for cheap. They have free chips & salsa to pass the time till your food arrives, which is always a plus. I've never seen a long line here & I've almost always been seating immediately.  Tres Pesos tries bright colors to draw you in off Woodlawn, but their prices are why you'll keep coming back.",

We left very mad. We will never go back, and will let all of our friends know about our lackluster experience. Oh, and the waitress dropped 2 beers when we got there, and they never even wiped it up.

Decked out in our Luke Kuechly jerseys, we decided to grab a seat at the bar to watch the Panthers game (yes, we won!!). The game was on a basic channel but the waitress (after 30 seconds of trying) gave up finding it for us and just handed the remote to my husband. I recognize this isn't a sports bar but there were like 15 tvs in this place all on ridiculous channels and we are the home to the Panthers! About 15 people started watching and cheering the second we turned the game on!  We ordered two beers. Didn't realize that when we ordered the bigger size, it would be a full 32 oz of beer. Not really complaining here cause both my husband and I love some beer and finished them. Just know the big beer is definitely big. Had to ask for limes for Dos Equis and Modelo. Pretty bare minimum service from the bartender.  Chips and salsa came out. Salsa had flavor but was super watery. We also got the queso with bean dip. Huge portion. Just ok. It was crazy crazy thick. I think i could have turned it upside down for 20 minutes and it wouldnt have moved. The beans dilluted the queso some, which made it a bit tastier.  We split the shrimp burrito, which came with rice and beans. Definitely a big enough portion for two. The burrito wasnt particularly good though. Kinda an odd mix of flavors and the shrimp were the baby kind. Not the best quality but the burrito was like $10 so guess I can't really blame them.   Took us a while to finish those beers after we ate but we had the game on and met a few people! Even though this place is close to our house, we most likely will not return.",

    "text": "Some of the food is 5 star, but the overall experience is a solid 3 or less. I've actually walked out 15 minutes after being seated and no one acknowledging us despite multiple servers walking by.   However, there are several pros. The chalupa is crispy and a perfectly balanced mix of flavors and freshness. The vegetarian fajitas have a great variety of vegetables. And the salsa bar is great. Being able to mix the regular salsa with chipotle and tomatillo allows you to customize your salsa exactly how you like it.   I've also had good luck with modifications to the menu. I ordered the pick 2 - chalupa and chimichanga - and the server accommodated me in making it vegetarian with grilled onions, pepper and other veggies.   I've read the bad reviews, but if you know what to order and if your service expectations are low, Tres Pesos is definitely the best value Mexican in the South Blvd area.",

    "text": "We came to Tres Pesos because it is always packed when we drive by.  We looked at the reviews beforehand and saw they were awful, but the majority were all several years old so we gave it a chance.  The old reviews are still applicable as of today.  The food had zero flavoring.  The chicken enchiladas and burrito we ordered were filled with a shredded chicken that had zero seasoning.  The chicken was plain and dry.  The steak that was topping our chicken enchiladas more closely resembled beef jerky. Refried beans had zero seasoning and the rice had zero seasoning too.  The only redeeming quality was that the service was good. If you like big plates for not much money and don't care too much about flavor, then this is the place for you!  I would highly recommend driving a few hundred feet down the road to Azteca instead.  It's worth noting that we have to affiliation to Azteca, we just really enjoy their food.",

The outside is charming, with the bright colors and cute sign. I went for lunch, and a few tables were full here and there but I wouldn't say that it was crowded. I ordered off the lunch menu, which for a vegetarian, the entire menu is somewhat limiting. It took over an hour for me and a friend's food to come out of the kitchen, probably because it appeared as though it was our waitress's first day. She got our order wrong twice and had to have someone come over to our table and translate for us each time. My friend asked for sour cream and she brought ranch. This same behavior occurred even after our bill came. I noticed that I was overcharged by a little over $10, but it wasn't worth the hassle. Let's find another spot on South Boulevard.",

How it's possible, that's a wonder. Meat on my tacos was dryer then jerky. Tacos weren't dress up with fixing/condiments that usually expect on them. My boyfriend got the stake fajitas which also fell short of expectations; veggies we over done/soggy & meat was tough. The service was beyond slow. Getting a drink brought to us from the bar was like twisting the bartenders arm even though we we're on the bar side and it was dead! Bartender tried flirting with my boyfriend which I did mention to her to back off. I get you work for tips but seriously so inappropriate to ask a couple who walk in if the guy is single while I'm sitting right there clearly on a date night with my man  wow. We both got uncomfortable and left quickly after receiving our food had 3 bits, packed up to go and left quickly. Most definitely disappointed. Officially 86 from our list of places to eat. Disappointing. Please train your staff to not be on the prowl while they are working. It's extremely unprofessional. Let's be professional now.",

I wish they had a negative star system or even better yet, a shut this fuckin' dump down button.  Wait staff is rude and dry and not very serviceable. The hostess sat us down and our waitress didn't come by our table for approximately 10 minutes. THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!! There was more staff than customers.  She finally comes then it takes her another 15 minutes to bring us the chips and the disgusting ketchup they pass off as salsa. With a massive chunk of a tomato right in the middle to boot. I kid you not, it's ketchup... with cilantro and onion. Ketchup....  I tried to order a torta... they don't have it. Mind you, not an, \"I'm sorry, we are out\" or anything. Just got cut off in the middle of my sentence, \"we don't have them\". So, I told her to put my fiancee's order in (she'd ordered first) and I will continue to decide.   15 minutes later, she's back. I tried to order tacos, the order comes with four fo them, I started saying I wanted 1 of asada, again, cut off in the middle of a sentence, \"you can only order two of a kind\". So, I said, ok and asked for two of those and two of lengua... cut off again, \"no, we don't have lengua\". I handed her back the menu and thanked her, but I was not going to order at that point and just to bring my fiancee her food.  Food finally arrives and it's a soggy, disgusting, clusterfuck of ketchup, rice, onions, peppers, chicken and cheese... I mean, it looked like vomit. The fiancee said it didn't taste as bad as it looked, but it was not very good. I refused to try it when she offered as it was visually very off-putting.  So, walked out hungry and annoyed as this was a pretty lame experience. For those of you who said you had a good experience, it makes me want to believe you've never actually received good service or good food anywhere else in order to believe this is acceptable...  NEVER AGAIN",

    "text": "I'm not sure why so many people gave this place such bad reviews. I've been twice now and have enjoyed both times. The staff is super friendly, and willing to go the extra mile for you. Trust me, I tested that out! I'm always that person asking for a million side orders and they were more than happy to provide them here!   The chips and salsa were so good! Both were definitely homemade. You can't go wrong with authentic salsa/chips. I saw a few comments about the salsa being too watery but that's just how authentic salsa is made, this isn't the first place I've been to where it was like that!   I ordered the tacos, 2 chicken and 2 beef. Sooo good! The tortillas were my favorite, again homemade and delicious. Comes with a huge portion of rice and beans, also good. My boyfriend got the dinner combo of a quesadilla and small burrito. Both looked good but the portions were a little small comparing them to my meal.  The service wasn't bad at all. Our food came out quick, we did receive the wrong order the first time but that was quickly corrected and I had to ask for a few things multiple times before getting them. Other than that we really had no complaints. This is a little far from where we live so we probably won't go too much, but if I'm in the mood for some good Mexican, I'll definitely remember this spot!",

The dish was hot and big portions like good food should be. If you want to spice things up make sure to ask for the hot salsa. Lastly, service was great.",

Ordered queso..never got it either. Tacos were plain and dry!! We sent two back because the taste was horrible and they still wanted to charge us for it. We asked for it to be takem off snd the waitress didn't want to take it off. She finally did but told us that now she has to pay for it and that we shouldn't order things we don't eat....well how did we know the pork taco was going to be nasty... Poor service and just not worth it",

The dinner started with some nice hot fresh chips with great salsa (always a good start) my girlfriend and I each ordered an entree and the meal came out about 10 minutes later.  Everything was pretty good and the service was quick.  It wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had but I don't have any complaints and I would return again.",

    "text": "I've lived on Woodlawn Road for 10 years and tonight decided what the heck, why not check out Tres Pesos for the first time with my gf to sit at the bar--instead of going to Azteca where we would normally go on Woodlawn.    Great atmosphere, great looking bar, better than average margaritas.  However, the bar tender rolled her eyes at me when I tried to get her attention to tell her I ordered corn and not the flour tortillas that were served.  The steak fajitas had NO flavor at all, and the onions and peppers were dripping with oil.  Picture unmarinated beef mixed with onions and peppers and dropped into the deep fryer.    My gf called the manager over so we wouldn't have to deal with the rude bartender again.  The bartender claimed nobody else complained about the fajitas all day, so why are we?    Thanks Tres Pesos, way to show customers who point out problems with your food that their comments are not welcome.",
