    "text": "My first taste of North Carolina BBQ.  All the meats are pulled, smoky, tender, moist and delicious...key elements of BBQ. I walked into the place and it felt like home, smelt like home but if the two dudes at the counter were in my home, I'd be slightly taken aback.   We had a half rack of ribs and the Family Meal(1.5 pounds of meat and 3 sides) so we ordered a half pound of chicken, pork and brisket with red slaw, brunswick stew and baked beans. Slaw was awesome, stew was a little too tomato for me and the beans were great   They cover all bases, saucewise. They have the South Carolina mustard base, the runny east Carolina tang and the tomato base Carolina sweet and hot, some of the best sauces I've tried.  Ribs place 2nd all time, behind Jim N Nicks...they come clean off the bone.  They're doin' things right at Rock Store...  wakawaka",

    "text": "Rock Store has become almost an every-week lunch place for me. I love the pork BBQ sandwich special - an affordable and filling option that comes with a drink where other places charge $2 for a soda...  Priced like a fast food restaurant, but the food is so much better than anything you'd find in a McDonald's, BK or the like.   They have 4 sauces on the table - hot sauce, Carolina Gold (mustard based), Stallings Secret (ketchup based) and a vinegar based. Personally, I love the vinegar sauce and the Stallings Secret sauce.   The building sits on the side of the road in a historic store made of rock (hence Rock Store), so it's pretty easy to spot. Seating inside is limited, and can be hard to find a spot during the busy lunch hour. There are 2 picnic tables outside when the weather's nice, and as a bonus during the spring/summer/fall months, the Providence Produce stand is directly adjacent.  Everyone has differing opinions about what good BBQ is, but Rock Store is the best BBQ around for me.",

I walked in the door and of course you can smell this amazing barbecue aroma . I ordered the pulled pork plate with a side of mac & cheese . Now I've had pulled pork before and on its own and it's usually this warm smoky  juicy and awesome tenderness thing going on .   Yesterday when I got home after a ride of maybe seven minutes to my house it was ice cold dry and flavorless. Needless to say my first impression was not great. Now I did get the spicy mustard sauce out of the bag put it on the cold pulled pork heated it up the microwave and Bam it just woke everything up it was great I really enjoyed the meal as I thought it should've been prepared or should've been presented when I pick it up.   I've been around long enough to know that sometimes first impressions aren't always correct no matter how much we research or anticipate I still believe in the three strike rule. Trust your instincts trust your gut whatever you want to call it people inherently use this to decide whether not they like something for me I believe integrity loyalty honesty is truly important.

    "text": "It's affordable!  And my parents love their pork BBQ sandwiches.  And there is a fantastic produce stand adjacent.  The young man that helped us was friendly enough.  That's the end of the good points for me.  Located on Old Monroe Rd, the rock store itself has been there for ages.  I dated a Union County boy for 6 years and passed this more times than I care to think about while it was convenience store.  My folks mentioned a couple of times how good the BBQ sandwiches were, and always on the search for excellent BBQ and ribs I thought I should make a visit to bring some takeout to the parentals to score inheritance points.    I wanted to try a variety of things so I got the 1/2 rack rib platter, which comes with 2 sides and a drink ($13), and a pork BBQ sandwich ($4).  I chose the mac and cheese and beans for sides, which come in small styrofoam cups.  The ribs were tender with plenty of meat but were boring - I make better ribs in my crockpot (then broiler) with Bulls Eye sauce.  The mac and cheese tasted like Stouffer's.  The beans seemed to be straight out of a can - my mom's baked beans (with BACON) are exponentially better.  And the pulled pork BBQ was tasteless - I guess you add the sauce to make it better, but I like BBQ that can stand on it's own - the bun had more flavor than the pork.  And the slaw served with it tasted weird.  Mom said it was mayo slaw, but bleh.  I put it on my sandwich, only to scrape it off.  The cup of mild sauce that we got was fine, but it is a very thin sauce that ran off of the sandwich.  If you like plain BBQ, this is the place for you.  If you want any kind of food with any kind of flavor, keep moving.",

Make sure you look at their hours  because they close earlier than most restaurants.  I suspect this is because they are so busy that they don't have to stay open late to make money.  If you love good southern BBQ, then you have to give this place a try.  They have a great selection of sauces that are all good.  You will just have to decide which is YOUR favorite!",

We mentioned that they were visiting and they threw in extra cornbread and even ended up giving us two T-shirts. I highly recommend the macaroni and cheese banana pudding and cucumber salad. The corn bread is to die for. Delicious food and inexpensive and you get real southern hospitality. This is definitely my favorite barbecue place in Charlotte.",

Great price for that as well.  Note that this is mainly a \"to-go\" outfit.  They have a few places to sit and eat, but almost everyone gets it to-go.

    "text": "I must say that one of the benefits to living in Matthews is that the very best BBQ place in the Charlotte area is just a few miles away in the Rock Store.  While the exterior is very unassuming, the throng of cars parked around the building should give you an indication as to what awaits inside.    The pork is pulled, not chopped so it holds the flavor better.  I prefer mine with coleslaw on top and their sweet sauce however they have mustard-based and even that inferior vinegar stuff if you so choose.    While you might be tempted to go for the pork sandwich special, the better deal is the pork plate, which comes with a bun and enough food for two sandwiches.  Still better yet is the family-size which has enough for 6 or 7 sandwiches.    Pork BBQ not your thing, don't stress.  They have chicken and beef available as well but their pork is unlike anything I've had anywhere.    I've also recently ordered a slab of ribs to take home all for my self - which was delish.  The meat fell off the bone!  For those that revere Lexington BBQ as the best in the state of North Carolina, I must respectfully disagree and say that The Rock Store is clearly the best by a country mile",

Hub had opened a cooler door which was right at the register (on our side, not behind the counter) to get a cup of coleslaw & the guy said, \"Don't touch that. We don't allow customers to get their own.\" Well then why is right beside the counter? This place needs help. It's in a great location & has a beautiful exterior. It could be a gold mine if the inside decor matched. And they hired nicer people.",

The BBQ Pork sandwich was a good portion with a nice smoky flavor and it came with a side and a drink for only $6.50. And when I say $6.50, it was EXACTLY $6.50, they don't bother to play with tax. They had 4 different types of sauce, Texas Pete, a homemade sweet/tangy BBQ, homemade Eastern Carolina Vinegar based sauce, and their very own Stallings Secret sauce. Overall great experience, I'd highly recommend giving it a try!",

I had my daughter with me and the owner was nice enough to help Me carry the order to my car.  Got it home and dove right in!  Meat on its own was flavorful and tender. They gave us sauces but honestly they weren't needed. My daughter loved the Mac 'n cheese. Green beans were yummy. Tons of food! Enough leftover for lunch the next day.

I was going to take it to go until I realized that, surprisingly, this tiny little building had five or six comfortable tables inside. The atmosphere is as wonderful on the inside as it is on the outside. Sauces in four flavors are great and slaw is available in two styles, vinegar or mayonnaise based. Prices are reasonable.

Ribs come with plenty (some say too much) sauce, but that's the secret stuff.    The pulled pork is great and the chicken is by far my wife's favorite.  Take some home and be sure to get a bottle of the rib sauce to take with you.  The corn bread is more like pound cake, and perhaps that's why I can't get enough of it.    Not many places to sit, so if you love their food and want to eat at the restaurant, then come early, or eat at their location in Mint Hill off of Hwy 51.  Don't forget the banana pudding for desert.  Only complaint is that you can't get it in a gallon container.  :-)",

They were out of brisket the first time, but the pork made up for it. I also really like places with numerous sauces to choose from. Both the tomato based and the carolina-style sauces are good.   Went back a second time to get the brisket and it was some of the best in the area. Our favorite has been Mac's Speedshop, but this is definitely up there. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that the brisket was chopped up, would love the option to have it sliced.   Will be back.....SOON.",

Not spicy, a little sweet with smoky  I also got a pulled pork sandwich, yes I did get a half a rack and a sandwich, what, big man gotta eat!  The sauces on the table where good I tried eat one. The mustard based one had a kick to it that I'm gonna venture and try again.  I asked about the rib sauce and they don't keep it on the table just for the ribs.  Only bad part was how the served the corn beard in aluminum foil for some reason that reminded me of school lunch back in the day. I ate it though!
