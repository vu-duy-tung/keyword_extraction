It took approx. 35-40 min to get our food (two in our party). The burrito filling consistency and texture was mush except for the tough chewy cubes of pork. There was a teaspoon portion of pureed avocado on one end. I would rank this burrito worst in town compared other restaurants in this category. The salsa lacked of flavor. Overall really disappointed. Will prob not return.",

You also normally are given chips and salsa when you arrive! This place comes with NONE of that! My date and I order chips and salsa because it felt wrong not to enjoy them at a Mexican place and what we received was a joke! Smallest little ramekin of salsa I have ever seen, I mean seriously couldn't believe how small it was. Now my burrito was tasty. I like that you can put queso on your burrito for a dollar but the fact that it doesn't come with a side is a deal breaker for me! If I remember correctly the sides were $3 each. The decor is interesting, the service line is an old truck front. Mix match chairs and a garage feel. The best thing about this place was the friendly service. They are very new and maybe they will make adjustments but I was overall quite disappointed with the new restaurant.",

Upon first arriving - and trying to decide where to sit - the owner approached us and asked if we were ok. We wanted to sit outside but all tables were full so he quickly pulled up two chairs for us and sent a waitress out way. The waitstaff was amazing! So so friendly!  We had the margs of course, the did not disappoint. We also got The Tipsy Sizzler for food. And oh. My. God. It was so good! So fresh. And so flavorful!   The vibe here is just perfect. It is a dive bar with an array of characters and I love that!  When we were leaving - walking across the parking lot - the owner ran out behind us to tell us goodbye. Seriously?! Killer service!   I left saying I can't wait to go back! I will definitely make this a go to spot!",

I couldn't understand the problem he is a bikers they play music we all like what they must have got a bad Vibe when they went in there he's hispanic looks White she's Black and Hispanic they both look white couldn't figure it out. Now several months later my bestie from Minnesota has come to visit it was late when she got here let's grab something to eat we went in they eyeballed us the server literally ignored us for about 10 minutes so we got up we left no one ever said a word to us and we went to Whiskey Warehouse had a marvelous time. I'm so disappointed I love the music that they had for their opening I actually sat down in front of my house and cuz she had the whole thing it was wonderful I was so hyped thought I had a place go to when Lupe's is closed I guess not!",

We were the only people in the place at dinner time except the few people at the bar. The atmosphere and music was pretty chill. I liked it. All the different tables/chairs were unique. The menu is small. I mean small. No variety. A taco was 2.50 but if you wanted meat in it, it was 1.50 more. The whole menu was like that. 6.50 for a burrito with no meat. So after adding chicken to it, ONE taco was 4 and a burrito 8. Also they don't come with sides!  No chips or anything. So I paid like 8 something for a chicken quesadilla and nothing else. I wanted black beans in it. Got charged for the black beans but they didn't put them in there. The food was bland. Got that from all people present at the table. Had been eying this place a while coming up and down monroe but I think that will be my last time.",

The decor is weird and cheaply done.   It's weird that they charge you for Chips and Salsa.....not to mention a small ass cup of maybe 4 scoops.  I thought it weird, also, that there are hardly ever any cars in the lot.....but now I know why.   It's just WEIRD.  From the moment we walked in...it felt uncomfortable.  There were 2 waitresses working the entire empty restaurant on a Saturday night.   Service was slow....orders were not placed correctly....food was sent back and remade.....yada yada.  The menu was EXTREMELY LIMITED...and a la carte.    No beans or rice come with your entree.   If You order a burrito....you get a burrito.....if you order a taco....you get a taco.  IF YOU ARE GONNA HAVE A LIMITED MENU.....the items on the menu better be dang good.   We had a taco and a burrito.   Both were somewhat flavorless and disappointing.    Perhaps the best part of the entire experience was the diet coke and watching the other diners trying to figure out the weird place too.  I hate to say it....but I dont think this joint is gonna make it.   There are too many great mexican/taco/tex-mex places that give this one a run for its money.    Nothing about it feels right.",

In a good way, of course. ;)   The interior is fun, with lots of kitschy decorations, including a velvet Elvis or two. I loved how every table and chair was different. We opted to sit at the big wagon table at the back, in front of the big windows that overlooked Monroe Road/Lupie's Cafe. It's still on wheels and rolls back and forth a little bit. Yay for interactive seating options!   The beer selection didn't live up to my admittedly high standards. I get the need to carry inexpensive PBR, Bud, etc. in a place like this but I would love to see even just one or two local sections. So many Charlotte breweries are canning now, why not add a Birdsong or NoDa option? Thankfully, the margaritas are awesome!!  The food was solid. We ordered a few stars including my special creation -- TNT fries with chili, queso and guac. Ultimate bar food and so good! The chips and salsa/queso/guac were all wonderful. The tacos were unimpressive compared to what you can get at other spots around town. Friends got burritos and they looked good. I loved all the fresh avocado!   Last but not least, we loved all the servers. Justin, in particular, was tons of fun!",

After going 4 times now, neither the food nor service has gotten much better. Have tried the margaritas, chicken nachos, quesadilla and tacos, and they are all just \"ok.\" The atmosphere is fun (free jukebox!), but the place could use a pool table or some additional games - I can't imagine the restaurant is full of folks eating very often.   Most recently, we walked down to check out their 1-year anniversary they had been advertising on FB for a while. The mood was festive and they had some live music outside. Unfortunately, one bartender had a sour attitude that really spoiled the event for us. She was snippy with all guests she interacted with.   Also, evidently to enjoy the music about 50 feet from the building you'd have to pay $25. This was really a joke since you could hear the music just as well from the back patio and decently nearly 1/2 mile back to the house.   If you want better nachos/food at similar prices, I'd recommend Sabor or Lupies, and for similar games and drink selection, Elizabeth Billiards.",

We got a shredded chicken burrito, a ground beef burrito, and a beef chimichanga. I got the shredded chicken burrito and had a tough time polishing it off because it was so large and well packed. We also split the chips and queso, because you can never have enough cheese.  Service was average, nothing out-of-this-world, but no complaints. Very cool decor going with a more divey motif. Glad to have a good local spot in the neighborhood and will definitely be returning soon.",

We shared the nachos, asked for steak since it's not listed as an option on the menu, but the server was very accommodating. For our lunches, my husband ordered an assortment of tacos, he enjoyed all of them, but especially the pork and steak. I ordered the salad with steak and avocado ranch. SO good! Honestly, I could have gotten the salad sans dressing and instead used the salsa, but the avocado ranch definitely enhances the flavor of the salad. The steak was cooked perfectly, was tender, and had a lot of flavor. We came back tonight (Wednesday 8-30-17) and brought my Mom. She absolutely loved her chimichanga and she can't wait to enjoy the leftovers tomorrow for lunch! This place is definitely a hidden gem with the coolest interior decorations! Love the Tipsy Burro!",

Atmosphere is cool, it's just your regular dive bar, service was good and friendly, but food is trash. Plus you have to pay for chips and salsa??? We paid like $5 for queso that was actually disgusting. Husband got the southwest burrito that another Yelper had recommended and it was pure sogginess. Everything is bland with zero seasoning... just go to Sabor if you want decent Tex-mex",

Major issues that would probably cause me to not come back: 1) You have to pay for your chips and salsa. When it did arrive the salsa was in a small plastic ramekin enough for 4-5 scoops. There were 4 of us eating so it went quick. 2) Paid $9.00 ea for a patron margarita. It came in a small clear plastic cup maybe 10oz. Add a bunch of ice and I was done with my drink in 4 sips. If you're going to be a dive bar, then have dive bar  prices. For $9.00 a piece I would enjoy a nice sized margarita glass.  Again maybe just wrong expectation. Folks were nice, food was average and food for 4 was $60+ for lunch. With so many great choices I will opt for something different. I'll come back for a cold beer.",

They also have a lot of vegetarian options which I find rare for a Tex-Mex restaurant.  Wednesday's they have Tipsy Trivia so there normally is a good crowd. The trivia is different than any other trivia in town that I've been to. She  always has a music section, pictures or puzzles on the back and of course your average 20-30 questions. If you you are a trivia fan come check it out 7:30 on Wednesdays.

They open at noon, so there was time for me to enjoy the sun and fresh air out in the large parking lot (gravel).  For the life of me, I cannot remember what was here before.  I usually think of Lupe's (across the street) first as being a long-term staple on this end of 7th street, but the Tipsy Burro deserves notoriety all its own.  The menu is simple tex-mex and you get a TON of atmosphere on top of it.  The pass through for the food is the front of an old truck - definitely sets the stage for all the memorabilia that line the walls.    Walk in, the staff greeted us and told us to sit wherever we would like.  All the tables and booths are unique along with the chairs.  Different dining experience every time!  The southwestern burrito (basically a breakfast burrito with a ton of other stuff in it) was actually pretty large and in charge.  I had trouble finishing it - the rest of the menu is simple enough... it actually reminds me of a Phat Burrito (oh those were the days).    Definitely need to think about this place more often since it's great for a casual weekend lunch/dinner.  I'm not sure how their weekday business is, but I would imagine a lot of the Elizabeth neighborhood could walk here and enjoy it.",

    "text": "This place is my jam. Tex-mex meets honky tonk with chill vibes and good drinks. The menu is pretty short and sweet but I've liked everything I've tried. It's definitely a step above typical bar food. I always get the nachos and pair it with one of their many many hot sauces (there's an entire shelf of bottled options adjacent to the bar). It's a huge dish so be ready to share with a friend.   Seating here is varied but plentiful. There's a large bar, some community tables, regular dining arrangement, plus outdoor tables around the back as well. Definitely a cute eclectic vibe going on inside that can suit a variety of occasions. A must try if you haven't been!",

    "text": "So, sorry for a two star review but I was truly disappointed with my experience at Tipsy.  First, Tipsy is not what I expected at all. I assumed, which I should not have, was that it was like Phat Burrito, however, it is so different. Tipsy is a full service restaurant with a bar, specials, etc. I happened to go on Trivia Night and the place was packed.  Drinks were strong, but the food left nothing to be desired for. However, I did love the chips and salsa. If you like Chili, avoid it. No flavor at all.  I am glad I checked it out, may be inclined to stop in for a Margarita, Chips & Salsa, but probably would pass on food again.",

The restaurant has old decor, like from a different era. It was eccentric and bright, kind of cool.  There were tables and high tops and bar seating.   You have to pay extra for chips and salsa, which I'm never a fan of. The chips came out hot and the salsa was ok. I ordered the Frito pie, which comes with chili. I got it on the side, which I'm glad of, because I did not like the flavor at all. I would suggest getting ground beef instead. The other food (tacos) were just ok. They came with beans when I asked for none, and just sort of underwhelming.   The prices were great, I just feel like it wasn't as good as I had hoped. Maybe next time. I would order the Frito pie again with beef and avocado!!",

I agree with Peter I pretty much ordered it just because I like saying chimichanga...  Honestly, the it was pretty standard, nothing special but not bad. I did add queso but on the side. I like my chimichanga when it keeps a bit of the crispy goodness with every bite.    The margarita was pretty tasty - if I come back I'd grab drinks only. I'm not a fan of paying for chips and salsa - mostly because I have zero self control when they are in front of me. Luckily, our waitress was nice enough to refill them for us, not sure if that's standard or not but it was a very nice gesture.   Overall, it's an A-OK for me.",

Full disclosure: they are terrible at honoring requests like \"no cheese\" or no lettuce.  I've eaten here three times and had three wrong orders to send back.  So I try to keep any changes as simple as possible.    If you order take-out make sure you double check everything before you leave.  They also forget to add chicken to chicken nachos.  A little disappointing they can't follow simple order tickets.  Seriously, take everything out of the bag and verify it because when you get home you'll be pissed you didn't.  But they have a full bar and it's casual and cheap.  And way too loud for this old man.  So I'm happy to let the cool kids have it.",

You know the type:  unmatched furniture, stuff hanging on the walls and a ceiling that's really cool when you're wasted, with that lingering smell of last night's tobacco and beer.  I've never visited past the lunch hour to know for myself; but, it seems like it to me.  Are they stepping up to become Charlotte's next Double Door Inn?  Damn, wouldn't that be nice.  So my impression is also supported by a limited menu, food served on an aluminum plate with an added layer of aluminum foil (just in case aliens are near), and good--but not great--grub.  I ordered a chimichanga mostly because I like the way it rolls of my tongue when I say it.  Adding the queso to the outside amped up the flavor and helped keep it moist.  It was filling, flavorful, and reasonably priced.  However, like almost everyone has Yelped, why are we paying for chips and salsa??  Dumb.  I say give 'em a whirl and make your own judgment.  I do hope they crank up the amps at night.  Then the menu makes more sense to me except the pay by the plate chips and salsa.",

    "text": "So this place barely got 3 stars, and only because food was decent. I went with two friends last night before a show at Ovens, so we were kind of on a restricted time frame. We sat ourselves, and the waitress took a few minutes to come say hello, which was more of a \"I'll be with you in a minute\" in passing. Eventually she took our drink orders. I was considering getting a beer after my initial water but she was not interested in speaking to us after we finally got our chips and queso. We then ordered and waited about 30-40 min for a quesadilla and 2 burritos. Problem: trivia night and only had one (visible) person making food. My quesadilla was pretty good, I got steak and avocado added in, but had to ask twice for sour cream (which was already on the menu so not sure why I didn't get any to begin with). Waitress did apologize for the wait, and ended up giving my friend a 3rd free beer before leaving, but whether or not she actually cared is debatable.   The scene was interesting. I get the theme- it feels like a random saloon in a desert decorated with random old stuff and bright colored lights.   Over all, if I am in this area again, and have more time to enjoy a restaurant without a time restriction, I may come back to give it a second chance. The trivia really helped my overall feelings towards this place because it gave us something to talk about other than how slow/limited our service was. Unfortunately not many options in the area, which is why we ended up here, but if you want to try a Tex-mex place, I'd just suggest somewhere else.",

The original name was going to be The Even Thirstier Beaver Plus Tacos, Fajitas and Nachos but signage ordinances in Charlotte prevent such large signs - and thusly, The Tipsy Burro was birthed - I kid- I kid!   The staff here is pretty much Rock and Roll. The waitresses are bad ass (in a good hot way) that could have come straight from a music video.  The decor is the same era as the Thirsty Beaver with a pretty freakin' amazing collection of retro beer lights above the bar (Billy Dee, Billy Dee). Lots of cool, kitschy details everywhere you look. The Cheryl Tiegs poster gave me a flashback to not only my childhood bedroom but the naughty poster section in Spencer's - you know the one. The piece de resistance is the truck cutout that serves as the window into the kitchen, definitely very boss. Or maybe it's the life size rabbit head - you decide.  The menu is straight forward - pick your dish - pick your protein - add whatever you feel like.  The Nachos with Chicken were decent. The Queso Dip was tasty. Probably the best thing on the menu is the steak sizzler. Plenty of food for two people. We were actually guided away from the tacos and to the Sizzler.   I appreciate a Pabst Tall Boy or a Dos Equiis now and then but still like to see some local stuff (happy to see Sierra Nevada but not really local), but I guess it wouldn't be as divey with craft beer.  I am a fan to be sure - but our bill for two adults and two kids was a bit high - just felt like there should have been a little more value. Looks like they do have food and drink specials!  Only one entrance to the parking lot, so keep your eyes peeled or you'll shoot past it in a heartbeat.",
