Favorite thing about this place is the farm fresh eggs. The yolk is really dark as good quality eggs are. Trust me you can taste the difference.  French toast and bacon were delicious. My husband said the grilled shrimp bacon pennine was amazing.  Not my top brunch place but good option if you live in the area.",

I have eaten @ 300 many times over the many years I have lived in Charlotte and can report that the food, service and experience is consistently really good.   300 East is a great place to have a nice meal with atmosphere but without a huge bill. I really like their simple black bean avocado on a toasted whole wheat tortilla (I add shrimp). There are definitely healthy choices and a menu with a variety of options depending on what you are in the mood for. Highly recommended.",

It didn't disappoint.   We had no real intentions of eating anything, but we knew we needed to scoff something down to help with the alcohol.  So we tried the crab cake appetizer and it was delish!  Very impressive...kudos to the chef!  That made us even more anxious to get more of the 300 East experience and order an entree. I got the special which was grilled chicken in a lemon shallot cream sauce with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was pretty good, though not sure if I'd order it again.  My friend loved our crab cake appetizer so much she ordered the crab cake entree, and loved it.    We were too stuffed to order dessert, but overall we were pleased with our visit. We will be back..",

Making the reservation then changing it twice to accomodate additional people was not a problem. We arrived and from the moment we walked in the door it was awesome. Our server was on point never letting anyones glass or cocktail go empty! Very speedy and anticipated things I would have not thought of asking for until my food had arrived.   The food... Let me begin by saying I had not been to 300 East in almost 14 years. The restaurant was chosen for sentimental reasons. Whatever the case may be, the food was just as spot on as it was when we went there in the past. I had the fish tacos but everything at the table looked just as delicious as the other. Moderately priced appetizers and entrees with 5 star quality!   I would be more than happy to recommend this place to anyone looking for something a little more upscale yet casual. I say again... it was an amazing experience.",

    "text": "Had a great time here today having lunch with a friend. Love the atmosphere, the service and the food is so delicious! As everyone else has said, the restaurant is in a restored home on the corner of East Blvd and Cleveland Avenue. At first, I was a little confused about where to park because although there is a lot in the back, the signs say \"park station customers only\" or something like that. Eventually I learned that you can park in the lot or park on the street. Upon entering, I had to wait a few minutes until someone greeted me but when they did they were very pleasant. It's True they won't seat you until your entire party is present but I can understand why. They take reservations and we were seated immediately upstairs. The only complaint I have is that it was noticeably warmer upstairs so it was a bit uncomfortable. The upstairs is like an open attic area so the heat rises. I guess it's hard to circulate the cool air upstairs. Our server was Gunter and he was hilarious! He was very friendly but not overbearing. He checked on us just enough to make sure we had everything we needed but didn't hover. The food was outstanding. They have a lot of unique dishes on their menu so I'm definitely coming back so I can try them all! We ordered the Sweet Potato Ravioli for our appetizer. Delish! It came with this sweet, yummy Alfredo sauce. My friend had the chicken tacos which he devoured so I guess they were good! I had the Harvest Salad which had butternut squash and roasted sweet potatoes, chickpeas over greens. I added shrimp for $7. Overall, it was an excellent experience and I'll be returning soon.",

When I tasted it, I thought they must use a very sharp cheese or something. My mother had the wheat Belgian waffle.

They really didn't have much on the menu for me, but the girls wanted to go so I went.  My meal made up of sides (bacon, hashbrowns) was tasty.  I also ordered a round of beignet for the table.  They arrived looking very burnt, but in fact where yummy .  It was in no way shape or form a beignet though.  More like a cake donut hole with a lovely lemon flavor.  The chicken and gravy biscuit is more like a pot pie. My girlfriend said it was good, but wasn't what she was expecting.  Two other dining companions got the french toast.....that was stone.cold.  COLD.  One ordered a side of chorizo..which is clearly offered on the menu as a standard side.  What she got was a bowl of crumbled chorizo.  That's just weird IMO.  It's like serving a person a bowl of ground beef.  We all expected it to be sliced chorizo.  Hands down the best entree was the breakfast pizza.  First they get props for serving a whole egg on top vs. the standard breakfast pizza that's got scrambled eggs all up and through it.  It works for someone like me who doesn't enjoy eggs.  The pizza was yummy.  I'll definitely order it if I ever find myself back at 300 East.  Service was the epitome of 'meh.  I probably won't go back on my own, but if others wanna go I'd be down....and i'd order the pizza!",

    "text": "300 East has great ambiance, especially once the sun goes down and the soft interior lighting generates a warm, intimate atmosphere. Ms. B. and I had our first experience here this past weekend, and we did enjoy it a lot. The charm of the place and the superior service stood out a little more than the food -- which wasn't bad by any stretch, just not quite of the caliber I was hoping for. The wine list isn't all that extensive but does feature several good dry red varieties, which is our preference. Ms. B. ordered the Farro Saute with grilled shrimp, which proved excellent. It was superior to my hanger steak (ordered medium rare) with onion marmalade, horseradish sauce, potato cake, and green beans. The steak itself was decent, cooked as desired, though a bit too smothered with the horseradish sauce, which I didn't find very appealing; it had more the flavor and consistency of mayonnaise than horseradish. The onion marmalade was very tangy, also a bit too much for my palate. The potato cake was actually the standout item -- quite delicious and worth a reprise. For dessert I had a nice portion of goat cheese souffle with chocolate crumbles and strawberries, which was tasty and rather surprisingly light. When I am back in Charlotte, I would like to visit 300 East again and try a few different menu items. I'm sure I would have enjoyed the steak more with better (or fewer) toppings. The atmosphere and the service, again, is so good that it overcomes any other shortcomings, and makes 300 East sufficiently a winner to bring me back.",

Our food was amazing and our server, Melanie, made it that much better. She was informative, knowledgable, SO sweet...she offered to take our picture. Most servers hate doing that (I worked in the industry for 15 years). We will absolutely be back and definitely be requesting Melanie as our server! She's the best!",

Granted I've only come for Sunday brunch, but this is my favorite spot. I am coming here every Sunday.  Literally, EVERY Sunday.  I took My Mama for mothers day and I've been hooked since.  I've come hoping it would be open on a Friday and Saturday for breakfast/brunch then finally got smart and looked at the times.  So why do I like it?  Being from NY, naturally I think I know everything about good food and have the ability to determine a good spot from a bad spot better than anyone else.  With that God given ability, 300 East is the has the best brunch in the CLT.  I've had just about everything on the breakfast menu now and its alllllll fantastic.  What else can I say??? Its a pretty nice spot, seems to be an old town house converted into a restaurant.  Prices are very decent and right on par with wafflehouse practically, but the food is far superior!    The only bad thing about this place is parking, or I'm just a fool and have no clue where I should park when dining here.  Regardless I give this place 4 thumbs up.",

The people that live on those streets think 300 East is very very nice. Well it is pretty nice. The food is solid, the service is great, and the atmosphere is very comfortable.  It must have been gay's night out, because there were tons of gay dudes there. Not that it bothered me at all, but moving out here last week from San Francisco, it was pretty interesting to see that in good ol' boy Charlotte.   I had the sweet potato ravioli with gorgonzola sauce & walnuts as an app, and it was pretty good. The sauce was lacking gorgonzola in my opinion, and a tad over-priced for potatoes and dough.  Next was the entree: Hangar steak medium rare (cooked perfectly) with horseradish sauce, mashed taters and carmelized onions & asparagus. The food was dissapointingly cold, but pretty damn good. I polished that fu#@ing plate.  Vanilla ice cream on a brownie with carmel & chocolate syrup was also very good. brownie turned to mush and was freakin' splendid.  All in all, great place. Maybe pricey for the casualness, but delicious none-the-less.",

The food here is very fresh and original.  The lunch menu is predominately salads and sandwiches, while the dinner menu has more entrees.  While the food is great, it can get cowded for lunch or dinner, and the service is not extremely fast.  There are aften people hanging out here after work for a quick glass of wine and maybe and an appetizer.  If you have an hour or so to spend, you wont regret going here to eat.  I highly reccomend the Fall Salad with port soaked cherries, goat cheese, and pancetta dressing.  ***UPDATE: they changed their menu so i can't vouch for some of the new stuff.  also, after the menu change you no longer get a side item with your sandwich- i like the food but that's totally lame.",

Honestly, you'll be pleased with anything on the brunch menu. For something different, I recommend the Cajun Grilled Shrimp, which is actually more grits than shrimp. You get a few large seasoned shrimp with a bowl of cheesy grits topped with runny eggs. Oh . . . a cute quirk about this place is their bathrooms. You have to look at the dogs very, very carefully to figure out which is the male room and the bitch room :).",

She also told me the soup of the day was cream of celery and cane out with red curried lentil soup. THEN...she took my food order (i was still reading the menu so i wasn't paying attention) and didn't bother to ask my daughter what she was eating! So, i ate my dinner without my 9 year old. I had to ask her to put my kids dinner in...ya know, the whole reason we came here, and then she brings the bill out with the kids meal on it. I'm not sure what the training process is here, but it just seems like too many small details are missed when this place is pretty expensive.

The food was definitely not worth waiting for but wasn't awful. The acoustics are terrible and we could barely hear ourselves talk. The tables are so close together that we couldn't help overhearing other conversations though. We won't be back. They used to have innovative creative cuisine that was flavorful and unique.

It's a pretty, charming spot but was chilly inside. I put my purse on top of the air vent by our table and ended up switching seats because I was cold. But, I guess I'd rather be cold than hot. Ordered the soup. It was good. Could have stood to be a few degrees hotter but the taste was delicious. I ordered a shrimp blt panini. Tasty if you like arugula but I'd say switch it out if you don't care for it. My husband ordered the chicken salad lunch plate. It was good. I think I tasted tarragon in it?

The vibe is dim-lit and very cozy homey feel.   They seem to have daily specials, and on Sundays they have $4.5 mimosa / bloody and half off bottles of wine! Our meal was very affordable. For 2 appetizers, two entrees, a bottle of wine and 1 dessert to share our meal came to roughly $80 including tip.   I started off with the french onion soup which is one of the better ones I've had. Nice carmelized deep onion flavor, rich rich cheese on the top broiled to a nice brown crust, delicious. My partner got the mushroom bisque special soup of the day, which was rich and flavorful. 5/5 on both of those.  For entree I received the half chicken over haricot verts, mashed potatoes and pan gravy. The gravy is one of the best home made gravies I've ever had! And the mashed potatoes were so creamy and delectable. The green beans cooked perfectly, good seasoning. The chicken was cooked very well, not dry at all on the inside but this lacked a little flavor. All I needed was probably a bit more gravy or seasoning/salt on the chicken, but overall amazing meal.  We also saved room to split their spiced butternut squash and vanilla cheesecake with seed brittle, butternut purree and gingercrumb which was amazing. Nice creamy texture, not too sweet and I loved the crunch texture from the brittle.   Our server was great as well. highly recommended restaurant!",

We ordered a few entrees and apps so we could share family style- because EVERYTHING looked soooo good. We loved all the food and the drinks were great as well! We had mimosas, ended up ordering a few bottles since they have this wonderful 1/2 price bottle special. We ordered beignets, which came with a plum sauce- great app to start with. We decided on the classic eggs Benedict, the bananas foster French toast (special of the day), and the breakfast pizza. It was all amazing and we licked our plates clean! I am so excited to have found a place that does exceptional brunch at a reasonable price AND so close to me in SouthEnd! Cannot wait to go back.",

It may be okay at other times, but I suspect they  get pretty packed during prime brunch hours. The service was really slow for some reason. I'm not sure if it was because we were upstairs or what, but we had to ask where our food was a couple of times.   Now, once the food came out, it was very good. Except for the beignets...they were just meh. They were also very small. I was expecting more. The price is decent....nothing outrageous. The mimosa was the best...mostly because it was 95% champagne. The atmosphere is very casual.",

I don't like my FT too thick or too thin, this one fits in the middle! Bon-appetite",

The restaurant has a nice cozy vibe to it and the service was good but the asian tuna burger was a bit of a let down.  The flavors were pretty good but it was really the bun that ruined it for me.  If they used a nice soft brioche bun as opposed to a kaiser roll that flaked apart like it was stale it would have been much better.  I definitely want to go back for dinner because the dinner menu has some great looking dishes that I could see being done well here.  The lunch menu was just very limited so I won't go back for lunch except maybe to try the burger.",

First of all, it's located inside a renovated old home, which is quite cool to begin with.  Right when you walk in you are somewhat taken back by how the house was renovated inside for this restaurant.  We have only sat upstairs, which was fun as the whole house is open and you can see downstairs.  Great people watching :)   The food was amazing.  Farm to table is a bonus.  Everything we have had thus far has been spot on and delicious.  Delicious deserts as well.  Great beer menu.  The only negative comment I can give is about the service.  It wasn't bad, per se, but it wasn't excellent.  A couple times we were wondering where our server went.  She would show up eventually.  I am not sure if this is because the place is kind of a maze, and kind of tight seating, so it's tough to get around. Or maybe they were short staffed, I am not sure.    Overall, despite less than perfect service experience, I still give this place 5 stars.  It's original, delicious, and a gem in the Charlotte restaurant scene.  We will be back and we will be recommending to many.",

The first time we walked in for brunch at noon on a Sunday and were immediately seated, amazingly enough. We must have been really luck because not only were we immediately seated, but we received a wonderful table for two near a window with fresh flowers on the table. I ordered their ham benedict with coffee and a yogurt granola, and it was delightful. Especially mixed with the atmosphere and our cute table, the entire experience was a joy.  On my second occasion, I went for brunch on the Sunday after Valentine's Day, and there was a thirty minute wait for seats, or we could take the open seats at the bar. We decided to take two open seats at the bar, and again, we were immediately seated. I ordered their special, which included a goat cheese-chevre omelette, ham, and potatoes. The meal was simply divine. This was some of the best food I've ever had thanks to their spot-on seasoning and toppings. I ordered a coffee and mimosa on the side. I had to wait until noon for the mimosa because of NC laws, but as soon as we hit noon, the mimosa was right out and the perfect side to my breakfast.   I will definitely be back to 300 East, and I certainly recommend this brunch place to anyone in the Charlotte area. It's a lovely staple for Dilworth, and I'm glad we have some a charming and delicious brunch place in the area.",

We also had the Carolina breakfast plate special and it was everything it was made out to be. Coffee and mimosas were also excellent.   Reservations are a must for brunch. We were promptly seated but the people who walked in with us at 11:15 on Sunday were told there was an hour wait.

The hanger steak had a lot of flavor and was cooked perfectly. I'd like to go back for brunch soon!",

Make a reservation and ask everyone to arrive on time - they won't seat you until your full party is there.  The interior is cozy (or, really tight - depending on how much personal space you want/need).    The menu is delicious and the specials are always tasty - you're not going to not enjoy your meal here.  Overall, I like the food, but find the restaurant a bit too stuffy for my taste.

What separates it from the rest? Well, there are a few factors:  1) Freshness of the Mozzarella 2) Fluffiness of the Baguette  3) Softness of the Onion 4) Flavorful taste w/o the overwhelming taste of salt.  Needless to say, I will be back very soon for more.",

Can get a bit loud depending on where you sit, so I would say this place is most conducive for parties of 1-4 people (maybe 6-8 if you sit upstairs and they put tables together.  For dinner, their French Onion Soup is great.  My dad ordered it last time they were in town and the flavor was REALLY good.  I'm also a fan of their chicken, which is so juicy and delicious!  Definitely enough to take home for leftovers.  I've also had the steak here before and it was certainly worth getting!  Dinner gets a solid four stars.  For brunch, my love for this place died of disappointment today.  Service was so incredibly slow and the waitress never came to check on us during the meal until it was time to clear the plates.  My Breakfast Pizza was clearly burned, which was disappointing as I looked at other well-made breakfast pizzas around me with lots of toppings and fluffy crust.  Brunch gets a solid two stars.  One star because the Mimosa was good and another star because I tasted the other dish on the table and it was pretty decent.  I would recommend this place for dinner and that's it.  I would pass on brunch so you don't run the risk of getting a sad-looking, overcooked breakfast pizza like I did.",

I like pets but I definitely like them away from my food.  *this was definitely NOT a service dog. This was a pet. I'm aware of laws that protect those with disabilities that require dogs. This wasn't one of them* it was a Sunday, the patio was closed the person waited with her dog and walked right in holding the dog. I've never seen a service dog that required holding, have you?",

The servers and staff have always been friendly to me and helpful. They do however, make you wait until your entire party is there to be seated. The lobby space is very small, so it makes waiting uncomfortable if you've come in more than one car. But once you are seated, it's beautiful, warm, welcoming. And the french onion soup is to die for. I'm so glad that I ordered it.   It comes out in a crock with cheese everywhere. It's salty, and comforting and amazing. Our server was very helpful too. My mom ordered one of the drink specials on a whim and he offered to comp it if she didn't like it.   So, in short, I will come back here time and time again for that soup. And I might branch off the menu too, the burgers are suppose to be good.",

    "text": "I think 300 East is one of those restaurants we take for granted here in Charlotte, but Charlotte is really lucky to have this established, quirky, neighborhood-y, and personality-filled place.  Probably the first unique feature of 300 East is its look.  At some point, this restaurant was a home and the dishes served here are eclectic american... really makes for a great Charlotte dining experience.  There is a small bar located downstairs and more dining located up a narrow staircase.  Limited patio seating is available as well, but the quirkiness starts as soon as you walk in.  The front entrance makes for a small host/hostess stand and a small bench for maybe two people to sit down (while waiting for a table).  I suggest you make reservations on a busy weekend evening, but I've been here on weekdays where it seems SUPER busy.  The waitstaff still try to accommodate, just be patient.  I can't even imagine trying to serve the patio area because you are using the front door and a ton of stairs to get there with food trays in hand.  Usually there are specials and the waiter/waitress will let you know about them.  In the front, there is some literature about sourcing local products and I'm sure 300 East has been doing this for a long, long time.  I know a lot of places now are jumping on the sustainability wagon, but 300 East has been at this game for a while.  Probably the key of making food really good is knowing where it comes from and establishing relationships with local farmers.  The very first thing I've tried from 300 East is their Matilda Wong (not for the average drinker).  They limit one per customer since there is a TON of different liquors in it and is quite potent.  Best Shared... but if you are brave enough, like myself... drink it all.... and wake up the next morning not knowing what happened the rest of the evening.  They have an assortment of other cocktails, local craft beers, and wine.  I know a lot of people come here for restaurant week, but I suggest going just on a regular weekday and experience the restaurant as it is (without the specials).  You'll definitely find a great place for lunch or dinner... and an even better dessert menu (and I'm not a dessert person!).",

The chicken saved the salad.  300 East is probably a 3.5/4 to others, but this was my first time here and I was HUNGRY. NOT the place for a heavy lunch. No brunch on Saturdays. However the menu lacked in entree options. If you're in the mood for salad OR a sandwich, this is your place for lunch.  Service was pretty good. I saw mimosas were $4.50 on special on Sundays. The price wasn't on the menu. So I asked the waitress how much they were. Her response: \"Full price\". While I was thinking, \"No sh*t Sherlock\" I politely asked what full price was. She didn't know, but eventually found out. All of the other drinks had prices on the menu. Service was great aside from that. She was nice and quickly responded to any request.   Overall, I didn't think my meal was worth what I paid, including the two mimosas.",

    "text": "Hubs and I came here for another friend's birthday. They have a parking lot in the back which is convenient and is located in Dilworth/Southend. It's very easy to find and feels just like you're dining in someone's house. It is very cozy and romantic feeling inside even though it's a casual dining spot. It was completely packed for a Thursday night, so I recommend making a reservation.   We were seated upstairs which was nice, but very tight. I couldn't take off my jacket and purse without hitting the people behind us. Our waitress was amazing and really fun. The drink menu had interesting mixed drinks and overpriced wine IMO. We picked up our friends' bottle of wine at $32, and that was one of the cheapest ones. For casual dining, that seems higher to me.  The menu options sound really good and appetizing, but I was rather disappointed in the actual meal. I ordered the gorgonzola stuffed filet wrapped in bacon which came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was absolutely amazing, but the mashed potatoes tasted like boxed potatoes and the green beans were so crunchy, they could have been raw. The other people in our party enjoyed their meals, but I wouldn't pay those prices for the quality you get again. Nice experience though!",

I called a few days in advance and was told to contact a GM via email.  I emailed and received no response.  Called again the next day only to be told the same thing and that they usually only handle gluten restrictions.  I never heard from the restaurant and during our dinner a few members of our group were stuck ordering salads and a side.  Service during dinner was great and our waiter did his best to accommodate, but customer service overall was very lackluster.",

Agh I'll go with dinner. My favorites, in no particular order: Baked French onion soup (best in Charlotte) Sweet Potato Ravioli (this is very rich, so I suggest sharing!) Grass Fed Burger Gnocchi (sage cream, prosciutto, & butternut squash, omg)  Tip: If you do go for brunch, get whatever is on special. I've never been disappointed. If you need a backup, the grits bowl is also delicious.",

We finished with dessert-pana cotte and choc brownie. Both were just the right amount.   The prices are very reasonable, and they have a nice variety of choices from fish to chicken to lamb.  However, what can kill any experience? Service. We waited over 30 mins to get the check from our server. She totally missed our cues that we were ready. After the second time asking for the check, she finally got it to us after about 15 more mins. It was very bizarre, as we were very pleased with her service prior to dessert. Maybe she was having an off night? I will definitely give them another try as the food was delicious!",

I sat for quite a while before I was greeted by a server. The food luckily, didn't take long to arrive. I ordered the French onion soup and a side salad. The salad was great. It had a great mix of vegetables pre-cut and ready to eat. Their balsamic dressing was think and tangy (very pleasant). The French onion soup had a great amount of cheese and onions, but was quite bland. It lacked that savory beef flavor that really sells a French onion soup. I finished my meal with their popular ice cream sandwich. The edges of my homemade cookie were slightly burnt. The cookie wasn't too hard or too soft, but the whole thing had a bitter taste, not sweet. The presentation was fine, but for this price, this was a major letdown. I'm honestly not sure if I'd go back.",

So all bottles of wine were half off - which was a great deal!  Not sure if that's why, but this place was packed for a Wednesday night! We had a 30min+ wait for two people. But the wait was worth it...  Like I said atmosphere was perfect! Food was delicious and the service was very good. I tried the Chicken Tortilla dinner and it was super filling and very good! And my friend tried the salmon which was also delicious and well done.  We also tried the Butterscotch Ice Cream Sandwich which was an amazing dessert! Tell them you want extra pineapple because the pineapple made the whole thing! Without the pineapple it was a little bland but the pineapple gave it a great flavor! They just don't give you a ton.",

We didn't have reservations for our party of 5, but they were able to get us seated in 5 minutes. We were promptly greeted by our energetic waitress who brought us waters right away which was great since we were a little warm from our walk in the heat. It was restaurant week, so they had an additional menu where you could choose a glass of wine, appetizer, entree and dessert all for $30. The portions were generous- they didn't seem to skimp on food if you ordered the Restaurant Week menu.  We loved the goat cheese dip appetizer!! Warm, tasty, lots of garlic cloves (YUM!) and warm bread. We chose both the flank steak and the burger for our entrees. The steak was perfectly cooked to our liking (medium), had a lovely sweet sauce on top, mashed potatoes, and tasty grilled vegetables. The burger was good! Nothing out of the ordinary but cooked to our liking (med-well) and the guacamole was a perfect addition.  We opted for the brownie and ice cream dessert. The brownie was warm and it had a nice presentation with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Perfect ending to a great meal! Our waitress was so attentive, always made sure our water classes were full, and checked to make sure we were happy with our food. Next time we visit Charlotte, this will be on our list for restaurants!",

Came around 6:30pm on a Sunday and there was ample seating inside and outside. Since it was a gorgeous day, we grabbed a seat outside.  On Sundays, wine bottles are 50% off, so we split a bottle of wine. Very good Syrah!  Since we were so hungry, we immediately put in an order for hummus. The hummus came out very quickly and was a very nice portion. Lots of pita and veggies! The hummus was great!  For our meal, we decided to split a Crab Cake appetizer and the Roasted NC Shrimp main meal. The Crab Cake appetizers were 2 nice size crab cakes with a corn salsa and aioli like sauce. They were probably the highlight of the meal! Full of crab meat!! The Roasted NC Shrimp came out next (they brought a second plate for me, since we split it), About 5 decent size shrimp, a few raviolis, and a ton of shrooms and asparagus. I absolutely loved the mushrooms they used! The goat cheese in the raviolis was also very nice. Wasnt a huge fan of the sauce though.....suuuuper lemony. Maybe a bit too much lemon for our taste. The dish was still very nice, nonetheless.   We don't normally order deserts but decided to get the Butterscotch Icecream Sandwich, since it was most recently featured on Diners, Driveins, and Dives. A-Mazing!!! The pinapples were so delish! I could have just eaten a bowl of the pineapples! The butterscotch sauce on the plate was so good that we kept just eating it with our fingers. The cookie was perfectly soft. Man, that desert may become the death of my weight loss plans!!  Excellent experience and can't wait to return!",

I got the pizza and it was so salty I couldn't finish it. My friend got the steak medium and it was still alive when it came to the table it was so rare. I like my steak rare but this was inedible. The goat cheese appetizer wasn't as good as the first time I had it. Maybe it was just an off night but I left disappointed.",

Took my lady Started with wine and a light beer. Then moved to a spicy pimento pizza pie which is great to split its about 13 inches (that's what he said) any way Bold flavors!! As for dessert we went with the peanut butter ice cream Sammie which had a jelly glaze and cream on the plate . Literally the best PB&J flavor ever .Thats what's up.  The only complaint I have is parking. Maybe I'm missing something but there is a huge adjacent lot that reads \"only for street car parking\" so I guess park on the street ?!   End of the day great spot for delicious food and what not",

We got the crab cakes, half chicken, and sesame salmon. The crab cakes were fine but I prefer more lump crab instead of bread crumbs. The corn salsa was a nice addition though. The chicken and salmon were both overcooked and the chicken lacked flavor. Service was super slow. We planned for an hour and a half dinner and 30 minute travel time for a 10 minute drive and we barely made it to the show on time. It's an old house turned into a restaurant which is maybe why people like it so much.",

It basically tasted like cold black eyed peas in raw onion/light tomato water. Just get fries. Service was good, but food was sort of slow for lunchtime (they were busy, so it wasn't unreasonably slow...just definitely not a quick bite). Three entrees, two teas and a water was about $40.

The menu is me based on local fresh ingredients, flavors and textures combined with the talent only a chef with incredible natural talent and love for food could create. I usually turn my nose up at fillet wrapped with bacon stuffed with cheese , in this case gorgonzola bc its usually there to cover sub par meat. This was the best steak in memory. You can taste the freshness, not artificially tenderized. Truly melted in my mouth. The vegetables and potatoes and everything cooked and flavored to perfection. I caught myself mmm'ing out loud for the first 10 bites! And just for the fact I didn't even glance at my phone the entire meal shows how much I was deeply enjoying it. Don't even get me started on dessert, homemade rose sorbet made with real rose and chocolate ganache. I hope the chef reads this and feels my appreciation and respect for the talent.",

I would highly recommend reservations because the couple in front of us did not have a reservation, and the wait time for them was 1.5 hours.   We were served by Ms Annick. Top notch service by her. We decided on hummus for our appetizer, which was very good. The hummus came with pita bread, carrots, and celery. I'm not too strong on hummus but my date really enjoyed it.   For the entree, my date chose the Chesapeake Bay crab cake and she substituted for some freshly made kale. She said it was outstanding on all levels.   I chose the grilled hanger steak with the vegetable of the day which was green beans, and mashed potatoes. It was over the top delectable. The steak had a white sauce that covered it, which gave it a distinct taste.   For dessert, we decided to share this strawberry pound cake-ish concoction with a scoop of ice cream. It also had a graham cracker-like crust. Overall, the dessert was underwhelming. We were hoping for more strawberries but it seemed like it was 1 strawberry sliced and diced 100 times.   Overall this place was quite the find. My date was pleased and that's what mattered to me. Highly recommended and we will be back.",

The brunch scene in particular is great for getting a group of friends together. My crew actually has a few individuals who are vegetarian or have physical dietary restrictions. While this typically poses a challenge for finding a good restaurant, this place offers a wonderful menu with something delicious for everyone! I've eaten their chicken, desserts, and recently, their french toast--all of which I've liked, and I'm sure there are more things I can try next time.  Simply put, it's a combination of good dishes paired with a cozy/quaint environment that has kept me coming back. If you plan to visit, I would suggest getting a reservation since this is a fairly common dining spot in the area. Plus Sunday tends to draw up a crowd of people eager to get their brunch-on.",

    "text": "Food- What a culinary experience! I thoroughly enjoyed my dining at this restaurant. I started out with hummus (that had capers on top...mmm!) and pita chips, which were exceptional. We also tried the goat cheese starter which is definitely my first recommendation. Warm and bubbly, with roasted garlic planted in and throughout--talk about some sort of perfection! It was served with bread. Nothing notable about the bread.  I shared my meal with my husband, so I was able to try two different entrees. I had the salmon which was marinated in nothing short of a perfect concoction. The coconut rice that it was paired with is, dare I say, genius. I also tried the sweet potato ravioli in gorgonzola cream sauce which is my preference and what I would come back to the restaurant for. The flavor and texture mastery is in the toasted pecans that are not only a garish but a surprise crunch once you're biting into the ravioli. SO good. Then for dessert, we had a seasonal melon tres leche cake; talk about thoughtful preparation. The cake alone was delicious, but add the crumbled white chocolate and cubed melon and the melon reduction...WOW! Incredible. MY biggest letdown was the brownie that I was served. I was hoping for an amazing brownie because they are known for their desserts, so I gave it a shot. Wrong choice. Undercooked (it was essentially batter in the form of a brownie) and definitely underwhelming.   Parking- there is a private lot behind the building  Ambiance- the dining area is so romantic and cozy. There is low lighting, warm colors, just a generally comfortable presence throughout the restaurant. We were sat in a cozy booth.   Price- we visited for Charlotte Restaurant Week which is a great deal in and of itself.   Service- great service! Waitress was attentive and had our orders correct.",

For 11.50 without the protein option it's a fair price. I added chicken and it's delicious!   They do recommend reservations because it's a small restaurant and has a good atmosphere.

We had a reservation for 6:30pm but came in late at 7pm - so our table was gone (no show). But no issue got right away another table for 2. I had the hot Piemont Cheese as a starter and than the Carolina shrimp on Gnocchi. All was good but no surprises, no craftiness but good, solid kitchen. Would I come again - yes, I think so.",

The food is decent but not incredible, and it's also not super vegetarian-friendly. For the price point, I expect to be thoroughly satisfied and that just hasn't happened here. The flavor isn't quite there - I think that's the biggest issue for me. Drinks are yummy and so is dessert. Everything else I don't find super unique or enthralling.",

When my partner and I arrived around 1:15pm on a Saturday, it was a full house with nearly all tables filled; and the decor was unique and felt rather homey. Once seated, it did take about 5 to 10 minutes for a server to approach our table. My partner ordered the Spanish pizza (chicken, serrano ham, gouda, manchego, and roasted pepper tomato sauce), and I ordered the Grilled Springer Mountain Farms Chicken sandwich (with apple chutney, smoked mozzarella, arugula on house ciabatta). Both entrees were... AMAZING! I definitely recommend 300 East for lunch, and we will certainly be back.",

    "text": "Romantic. Cute. Cozy. Delicious. Words to describe 300 East.   Food: I tried the Farro Saute with grilled shrimp - SUPER good. It was a relatively healthy dish but very flavorful and cooked to perfection. My bf had the Grilled Hanger Steak, which was also very flavorful. Fresh ingredients (you can tell as soon as you taste the food), well seasoned and prepared to perfection - that is how I'd describe the food. The wait for the food wasn't too bad either. They also have a good wine selection for all you wine lovers and connoisseurs.   Service: Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable. No complaints there. Also, a note on the prices - for the location and quality, this place is not overpriced.   Ambiance: ROMANTIC! This place is intimate, has low lighting in the evenings and definitely appropriate for date night. The booths and tables are nice inside, and has outdoor seating as well. This building is over 100 years old, but still looks very nice. That being said, in my own opinion.... this place is not appropriate to bring the kids - its not loud at all in here. This restaurant is appropriate for date nights as I said before and during the day for work lunches as well.   Overall, my experience was definitely enjoyable and I will be returning.",

My co worker and I were looking for somewhere that was nice but close to get an Uber so came up with 300 East. This was amazingly perfect! It is a restaurant that has been around for more than 30 years and is in an old house. We got there kind of early, around 5:30 so best the rush because seating was limited. We chose to sit inside because of the hot humid air but they had a nice patio with fans out. I went with the crab cake which was very good. And a side salad! It had a side of mashed potatoes and green beans which were all cooked very well! My co worker got the salmon and spinach she said it was the best she ever had! Pictures are below! If you are in the area for sure try 300 East it is worth it I promise!",

We had reservations for 11:00 am so we were one of the first to be seated but it filled up shortly after. The waitress did not know the specials however they were posted on the board when we entered so I knew what they were prior to her attempting to tell us. I really enjoyed the goat cheese appetizer, the bread was fresh and warm and the goat cheese very smooth for spreading. I would have liked more red peppers to have when spreading on my bread but it was really tasteful and smooth regardless. I tasted my husbands onion soup, it was good but onions aren't my thing, he really enjoyed it although he struggle with the thick melted cheese but I think that was more of a HIM issue. The soup was very tasty, the curry looped in the Indian infusion which I loved, it was light which was great since I wasn't super hungry. My husband really liked the crabcakes sandwich, it was very filling. We were a little disappointed in the Reuben casserole, it was dense and slightly under seasoned. Had it been a little loose and less cheese with perhaps a little more slat and pepper it would have hit the mark.   Overall a nice spot, trendy and a great location. Lastly, I would have preferred a designated male/female bathroom just bc the restroom I sent like a restroom with a urinal, my own personal feeling.",

The salad dressing was light but complementary to the flavors.  I was also very happy that, when I ordered shrimp on the salad, I got more than just 2 or 3.

Loved the ambience and character of this restaurant however you don't go just to sit and look around and that is where it falls extremely short in our opinion. My husband ordered the special fried chicken breast for $20 he got 2 breast that looked like small fish portions at Captian D's. he had to get drive trhough on the way home he was so hungry. I ordered the Hanger steak. When we got our orders the food was cold couldn't find out waiter so we just ate it anyway. Our mistake. For $20 an entree you should get a salad and at least some bread you get nothing but your small portions. We made reservation and asked for a cozy table for 2 we got a drafty table for 4 by the front windows. Took us 20 minutes to get our check back and leave maybe this is why the waits are so long if you don't have a reservation! With the economy the way it is we all want value for our money you are not getting value, or service at this restaurant we will take our business somewhere else.",

Tough night to score big, and Friday night to boot....   dang they did it again.  From Hanger steak to pickled shrimp. All was awesome.  That deserves a 5 star. The Passion fruit Tres Letchies desert was crazy good.",

    "text": "OK 5 stars, Why?  Coz, I just found my new guilty pleasure.  This was our(wife & I) second time to 300 East for Sunday brunch.  Like our first time we ordered our beloved Beignets -  what could go wrong with it, its a simple sweet, fried dough balls coated with powdered sugar with a side of some tasty peach compote.  just love it and this is a default option we choose.  Wife ordered the Eggs Benedict - again a simple looking dish, with two poached eggs on top of soft English muffins and super tasty hams, hollandaise on the top or on the side.  Simple, elegant and tasty breakfast/brunch plate.  Here comes the guilty pleasure part *drum roll* I forgot the name but its like a FULLY LOADED French toast, yes its a simple, old school French toast but damn did they make it the best tasting French toast ever (at least I ever had).  Literally this one is fully/over loaded.  Its basically  your regular French toast stuffed with mascarpone (loads of it), with caramelized peach (loads of it), blue berry, strawberry, choco syrup and couple other delicacy syrups like maple I think to make all the more alluring and regret yourself later for having it, oh yea atop is a delicious scoop of French vanilla ice cream and couple bacon strips on the side. this was a $14 bucks heaven, and is my new guilty pleasure.  Don't miss it!!",

The service was fast and friendly, but the food did not live up to the 4 star rating. We ordered the Spanish Pizza and Pork Entree (vanilla bourbon soaked with corn bread waffles) and were severely underwhelmed by both. The pizza was poorly executed. The crust was cooked but didn't taste like it (except around the edges), the \"jamon serrano\" was thick and hard and the sauce was from a can. The pork was perfectly cooked, but the vanilla bourbon marinade was overpowering.   The atmosphere is okay - not impressed.",

    "text": "The fella and I visited 300 East today for Sunday brunch after numerous trips here for brunch and dinner with no review, so I figured it was time!  I love the ambiance of the bungalow style house; it feels cozy and inviting, and since it's usually crowded, it can sometimes feel a little cramped, but that generally adds to the atmosphere for me.  If the weather would ever be nice when we're there, I'd love to sit on the quaint patio out front.  Today, I got the granola (Greek yogurt with blueberries, strawberries and granola), and the fella got the breakfast pizza.  Our waitress said it was the size of a large dinner plate, when in fact, it completely dwarfed the plate.  The chorizo gave it a little spice, and the texture was perfect.  It's difficult to mess up granola, but it was pretty darn good.  My only beef with 300 East is the service.  The times we went before they started using Open Table, our reservation was inevitably wrong every single time - they had us down for 3 people instead of 2, or they had our reservation 30 minutes earlier or later.  After using Open Table, the reservation process seems to have gotten better.  However, we made reservations today for 10:00 a.m. (when they open).  We got there and saw a family sitting outside waiting, and when we opened the unlocked door, the woman inside said they \"weren't quite ready yet.\"  Odd.  After a large crowd started to grow outside, she finally popped her head out around 10:12 to say they were finally open.  After that, our waitress was spotty at best, and I had to go searching for another waitress when I needed something.      I've been holding off on reviewing 300 East, hoping the service would eventually measure up to the atmosphere and food, but after about 5 trips, I figured it wasn't going to get any better.  Too bad.",

    "text": "Really I could give them 5 stars for atmosphere and food because I have been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.   I had to knock them down one star for my most recent visit, only because the service was a little chaotic.  Let me start by saying that I love 300 East.  It has a charming atmosphere, one that you would expect to see in Charleston.  They have a creative menu, different than any other restaurant in Charlotte and they are very reasonably priced.  I really have not had a bad thing here.  They are somewhat of a staple in the Dilworth area of Charlotte so the have the ability to attract people from everywhere!  My most recent visit was yesterday for brunch.  The specials sounded divine!!  They offered a PB&J stuffed French toast!!  I follow them on FB so I see all of the daily specials and they sound heavenly every single day!  The whole brunch menu is just fabulous and pretty much covers all of your cravings.  They have all the basics, the benedicts, French toast, salads, wraps, soups, appetizers and then some of their more creative concoctions.  My order was pretty basic--scrambled eggs, fruit, and bacon.  My friend ordered the French toast and literally licked her plate clean.  One thing I thought was interesting is the waitress asked us how we wanted our scrambled eggs:  Soft, medium or hard.  I can honestly say I have never been asked that before so I went with \"hard.\"  The eggs came out to my satisfaction so I guess that was the right answer!  The issue with this visit, as I mentioned earlier, was the service.  We sat there for about 10 minutes without being greeted, the drinks took FOREVER to arrive, we ordered an appetizer and it never came, I ordered hashbrowns for my side but I got a bagel, etc, etc etc.  I think it is so cool when servers can go from memory and not write anything down...but it quickly becomes uncool when their memory fails them and they botch the whole meal----ie, MY experience.  She was very apologetic and offered us a free mimosa or in this case orange juice with a splash of champagne but I really didn't want that and so it just sat there, wasted, unfortunately.    It isn't a big deal but it was a little annoying--no manager involvement, which I would have expected at a place like 300 East but again--no big deal.  They were super busy and so these things happen.  I still love them, no hard feelings but let's not let this happen again!!",

    "text": "I've been to 300 East now for both dinner and lunch and I can't choose a favorite. The location is splendid and conveniently located off of East Blvd, the old house is outfitted nicely to fit the targeted ambiance, and the food matches everything above.   Our last visit consisted of a few apps and entrees:   Baked French Onion - Small crock, croutons, textbook flavor, gratuitous provalone baked on top. Can't find a thing I don't love about it.   Sweet Potato Ravioli - Nice mix of savory, sweet, and creamy flavors. A little too heavy on the cream sauce, but the rav was al dente and sang on the forefront with holiday-esque spice.   Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - The dressings alone make this salad crave-worthy. Sesame, soy, ginger, hoisin, of which are perfectly balanced. The tuna was gorgeous and was even better with each bite.   Much like aforementioned by the infamous Jeff S, the Matilda Wong is not only a right of passage for first-time 300 East-goers, but for booze lovers everywhere. It's 32oz pitcher, quite literally, filled with three different kinds of booze. It tastes like liquid candy and goodness gracious I love it.   Parking is straight up atrocious. Forget about feeling comfortable leaving your car behind this old house. A half dozen signs screaming \"Your car will be tortured by a towing service if left here.\" Not the most comforting parking arrangement. Find a space on the street if you can.  Regardless, this place rules. Pricepoint is fair, food is great, booze is even better.",

For the appetizer I had the baked marinated Vermont toast cheese with roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, and a baguette which was to die for! For he main course I had the sweet potato ravioli which was equally as amazing! For desert I had the Warm Callebaut Brownie - honey chocolate sauce, salted caramel, vanilla ice cream which was my favorite part of our experience!

    "text": "We almost drove by it the first time around since it looks like someone's house. That's part of 300 East's charm; it feels like you're a house guest enjoying Sunday brunch or dinner with friends. There's a small outdoor patio space with a few tables out front. The entrance is a bit of a bottleneck since that's where the host stand is but also where people are coming in and out (both servers and patrons). It can easily get cramped with more than 4 people standing there waiting to be seated. Despite this, the host is very friendly and did his best managing the traffic.  I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner during my current visit home. We were lucky enough to sit outside for lunch the first time around. My friend and I split the Housemade Spicy Pimento Cheese appetizer. Lots of cheese enough to take home for seconds. The crackers were regular saltine ones. We both enjoyed our salads. I tried the Mediterranean Chef while she had the Fall Salad. For dessert, we opted for the Callebaut Chocolate Brownie. It was moist and decadent. Our server had recommended the Butterscotch Ice Cream Sandwich which is their bestseller and I regretted not trying it since it was different and popular.   Naturally I had to come back to try it...so I returned the next week with my brother for drinks, a \"light\" dinner, and dessert. It was definitely crowded for a weeknight but we were able to grab a booth inside on the second floor despite not having a reservation. There was a bit of a delay from when we were seated to when the server came to greet us but we weren't in any rush. We started with a round of drinks then split the Chesapeake Style Crab Cakes and a Spanish Pizza. The drinks also took a minute to arrive, which may have been a good thing to pace ourselves. The crab cakes came two pieces an order with a side of corn salsa and remoulade. The majority of the cake was moist crabmeat that was seasoned nicely. The pizza was also tasty...Gouda, Manchego, and Serrano Ham, oh my! Nice thickness in the crust and good ratio of chewiness too. We obviously had the Butterscotch Ice Cream Sandwich for dessert, which lived up to the hype. Man those chewy molasses cookies with the crunchy turbanado/raw sugar crystals on top did me in. Perfectly paired with the ice cream and the caramelized pineapple. I ordered a glass of the port wine while my brother took advantage of the 1/2 price Rose by the glass special and tried the one our server recommended went well with the dessert. Glad I went back for the dessert and enjoyed the entire dining experience all over again.",

    "text": "We ordered the Farro with grilled shrimp and the Grilled shrimp entree served with kale, polenta, and pimento cheese. The presentation was distinguished and upscale. The food was delivered reasonably quick. The service was excellent, the waiter from another table even stopped by to top off our waters and help her fellow server. As for the food itself the Farro with the shrimp is by far the superior meal, it was cooked with butternut squash and reduced with a balsamic vinaigrette that cut the bitterness of the sauteed kale and heightened the overall flavor of the entree. The Shrimp in both meals was well cooked and seasoned, however, in the shrimp entree, the polenta was very thin and very under seasoned. The polenta was served with prosciutto which aided in the salt department, but it also was served with pimento cheese, this made the mixture way too salty. There was a predicament between eating them all together or separately to avoid burning the palate, but at the expense of a middle of the road bland polenta. Overall experience was 4.5/5, I would return for the farro and would suggest this meal if uncertain of the entree choices!",

I try not to judge a place too much during restaurant week since this is an abnormally busy time and a condensed menu. For $35 you are able to get a glass of wine, app, entree and dessert. Most places don't offer wine so this is a bonus:) I order a pinot grigio and the pickled shrimp and grits app.  The shrimp taste just like vinegar. I could not eat them. I am not sure what taste I was expecting but that was not it. For my entree I ordered the half chicken with mash and green beans. The entree was nothing to brag about. It was descent to eat but nothing special. The dessert I ordered the bread pudding. I was expecting it to be hot but it was cold. Still good cold just not my expectation. I will go back to give them another try outside of restaurant week but I wont order the chicken. oh, I also ordered the soup of the day, chorizo and potato, trhought it would be chunky, but it was pasty. don't order that",

I would add a little feta cheese and it would be even more amazing! Also the salmon bagel with egg was super flavorful! And mimosas are perfect, not too much orange juice but enough to not have an overpowering champagne taste. The flavors of the food were rich and did not disappoint.  We (party of 2) sat at the bar because the wait (around 12:30pm) was 45 minutes to 1 hour and we were very hungry! The bartender was friendly and service was pretty quick.

When you come here for brunch, you cannot go wrong with the French toast with bacon. Thick slices of bread covered in deliciousness. They use real maple syrup and the bacon is on point.   If you're looking to try something different and amazingly rich, get the breakfast pizza. But keep in mind that this is a larger dish so have someone to share with. But this pizza is probably the most unique and bold brunch item I've seen around town.   This place is reasonably priced, maybe even cheap for the quality and amount of food you get. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for breakfast / lunch.",

The breakdown:  Wine- 4 varieties to choose from (Pinot noir, Grigio, Riesling and a Cab). They were very generous with the pour.   App- I got the shrimp and grits (smallest sized option), but was very good for a starter. It did come with a bed of greens on top, which were a little weird but tasted great once mixed in. Others at our table got baked goat cheese, which came with novas bread and the hummus platter. All looked and tasted great.   Entree- I got the salmon which had an awesome sesame marinade on top. The jasmine rice was basic, but the side of sauteed spinach brought everything together (very tasty when mixed together). Salmon was cooked perfect as well. Two others got the steak and potatoes which they said were awesome. Lastly, my friend ordered the half chicken which was HUGE! Overall, everyone enjoyed their meal.   Dessert- we all got a mix of the desserts (goat cheesecake, chocolate brownie and white chocolate pudding cake). All were delightful.   Our server was very attentive and overall we had a very enjoyable evening. We will be back soon!   I've also been here for lunch a few times too. The falafel and crab cake sandwich are on point! I've heard their brunch is a must!",

    "text": "Hopefully we had a unique experience. I ordered the marinated tuna steak special. It was so salty it was inedible so I sent it back. They had a stuffed fillet on the menu so I figured I could get a fillet without the stuffing. I'm always suspicious of a great piece of meat being stuffed and covered. I was informed I could only get it stuffed. Hmmm are they getting the meat off the Sysco truck already stuffed? So I ordered another type of steak medium rare which arrived well done. Again so salty I asked them to leave a pitcher of water on the table. The veggies were visibly caked with salt as well. The wine was 'corked'   For dessert I ordered a cobbler with a scone topping and a scoop of ice cream. They forgot the scone topping and ice cream.   I really hope it was just a bad night for them but I have no intention of giving them another go.",

I. Love. This. Place.",

Our requirements were not too expensive, not too fancy, not chain and if it had some character or charm that would be great. 300 East delivered on all accounts.  I ordered the lentil burrito which was really good. My wife loved her Filet. We all were amazed by the sweet potato stuffed ravioli for appetizer and if we would have known it was so \"to die for\" we likely would have ordered it for our meals.  Dinner for 4 with a bottle of wine and an appetizer was about $120...not too bad. We had a great time and would likely go again next time we're in Charlotte.",

I always end up back here when I'm thinking of a class act without the price.  You can hear folks talking to you, the ambiance is suburb.  My sister used to wait tables back in the 80's at the White Horse...so I have a bit of a history with this joint!  Yes, owners have changed, but Cathy is the present owner, and she does a stand up job.  Walking in the door is like coming home.  In a city that is constantly changing, it's nice to know some things that are perfect don't need to change. There's a question about is it good for groups, only in the upstairs loft area.",

    "text": "Sigh okay so I'm not sure how really to review this place... I was tempted to give it 2 stars but I think to myself was it really THAT bad. The answer is no, it's just so very underwhelming. Maybe it's because we went for restaurant week, but not a single thing were we overly impressed with. The best thing we had was the half chicken, at least in my opinion. On to dinner... we started with the goat cheese crostini appetizer and a salad. The salad was good but nothing out of the ordinary and same goes for the other appetizer. Oh we also got a glass of wine with the 3 courses and we both got the Cab which was not all that drinkable to me. It was pretty sweet for a cab and tasted a touch vinegary like it had been opened for awhile. For our main course we ordered the steak and the half chicken. The half chicken was good but didn't wow me and I did not like the steak at all. I literally gave my piece back. He thought the steak was fine but not good enough to make him want to come back. Desert was brownie and bread pudding. Both good but forgettable. That basically describes the whole evening forgettable. The only reason I will remember is because our server was weird. I can't quite put my finger on it but he was fairly attentive and handled things well so it wasn't bad service it just felt a bit like we were being served by a robot. Almost like his body was there working but his brain was elsewhere. All very hard to explain. Again it was good service just uncomfortably impersonal.",

We asked her to take the whole plate back and not do it in front of us; it wasn't  appetizing at all. She returned with the same plate with less items on it. I know mistakes happen, but this is not how it should be dealt with. We were charged full price with no apology. This is not how I would do business!",

    "text": "Atmosphere: We requested to sit in the front near a window since it was a fellow diner's birthday brunch. They kindly accommodated this request (made through a Yelp reservation). Unfortunately, the blinds didn't do a great job of blocking sunlight into a diner's eyes and the space was kind of chilly near the windows. I will say that the front window area feels more contemporary than perhaps the rest of the space, which feels like an old house. I like the front for that reason.  Food: We were there for brunch and the food was pretty underwhelming. The whole grain Belgian waffle was terribly bland. The bacon was delicious (ask for it extra-crispy!) and the grits dish looked good and my family member confirmed as much. The omelette was OK said the birthday boy - nothing terribly out of the ordinary.  Beverages: We did not partake since it was not yet noon on a Sunday, but I saw mimosas on the menu and would have enjoyed that. A fellow diner did rave about the drinks from a previous visit, so I would come back to try them.   Service: We were watched over well, although our server made me feel a bit awkward. Not really sure why. The food took a pretty long time to arrive, but we weren't upset by that.  Overall: With so many great brunch options in Charlotte, I don't think I would return here for brunch (especially with no booze until noon!). I would return to try 300 East for happy hour or dinner since I heard the drinks are good. Otherwise, this is just nothing terribly exciting for me when compared to other options.",

Ive been there twice now and have enjoyed it both times - once on a first date (great first date spot!) and once with my boyfriend's family. The quality of the food is excellent, and my favorite thing about the restaurant is that it uses local fruits, vegetables, and meats. I buy the meat I use at home from Windy Hill Farms in New London, NC; and was so happy to see that this is where the restaurant buys its meat, too!   The only couple of negatives is that in my opinion, it's just the tiniest bit overpriced; and that on Sunday the lunch menu for some reason is a condensed version of the everyday lunch menu. I guess this is because they have brunch on Sunday, but don't see why the standard lunch menu isn't offered in addition to brunch.",

    "text": "Just returned from a disappointing brunch at 300 West.  Visiting from out of town & were so looking forward to a wonderful experience.  We ordered the specials - smoked salmon club & their frittata.  Our meals took almost 45 minutes to arrive.  We were informed the reason for the holdup was due to a rush & the kitchen got slammed.  However, we noticed other tables arriving after us receiving their food.  Go figure!?  When our food finally arrived, the bread on the smoked salmon club was dried out.  It seemed to have been sitting for awhile.  The frittata had as much cheese as egg & the lardons were'nt lardons, but large sausage-like chunks.  So wanted to have a wonderful Sunday brunch, but not at 300 West",

I liked the atmosphere of a old house converted.  We had the baked goat cheese and it was awesome, the bread was fresh and the goat cheese with the garlic oil was great. I had the sweet potato ravoli. Now I'm not a huge sweet potato or Gorgonzola fan... But this was really good and the sauce was mild. The little creamy with sweet taste was perfect. My husband had a steak, the flavor was good but it was over cooked so that's why the 4 and not 5 star.  For dessert we had the brownie and was really good, you could tell they were fresh!  Look forward to trying their brunch",

Sat upstairs and ordered two sodas the black-eye pea falafel for an appetizer and chicken tortilla entree. They were more than happy to substitute the flour tortilla with corn to deal with gluten intolerances at the table. Walked out with full meal for two for under $35 with tip. Really dig this place. Highly recommend.   Took me minute to figure out which bathroom to go into. You'll know what I mean when you see it.",

    "text": "I arrived here for lunch, imagining that I would sit on  300 East's lovely patio.  I was greeted by a charming host, who, upon assessing the situation, told me that there was no availability outside.  However, he offered me a spot at the bar, which was perfectly fine.  Getting a little hot outside anyway. Once seated at the bar, Mike offered me a wine list.  I chose Chateau Saint Jean Chardonnay.  I had difficulty choosing food,  because there were so many good offerings.  Vegetarian and gluten free choices were available, and that gets high points with me. I selected the Mediterranean Chef Salad, which featured greens, chickpeas, tomatoes, olives, and artichoke hearts.  It also came with both feta and blue cheese.  I was given a choice of dressing, but stayed with the balsamic vinaigrette.  Before my meal arrived, Mike put a placemat in front of me.  What a nice touch! Mike offered bread and butter, but, struggling to keep my girlish figure after a milestone birthday, I declined.  The salad itself was amazing.  Every bite was like a grand finale of flavors.   After my meal, Mike chatted with me in such a sincere manner.  He seems genuinely interested in his customers.  His nice \"bar side manner\" was truly the icing on an already perfect cake. The food, the host and the bartender created the perfect setting for my lunch today.  300 East has the right formula.",

I was very impressed with the meal, especially the special which was a poached egg set inside a roasted tomato, topped with cornbread. The cornbread added an extra dimension that threw that normal poached egg over the top. The tomato and egg, as well as bacon, also came with a side of pimento mac and cheese that was out of this world!! My friend and I also shared the brioche French toast and cheese grits. The French toast tasted like a donut and threw me into a sugar coma that was well worth it. The service was excellent and I will be back soon!!",

    "text": "If you like sturdy Old Faithfuls, 300 East is the place for you. I've been dining here since 2002, and it never disappoints. It's a great place for lunch, which is usually when I end up at 300 East most often. Special memories are also a contributing factor for me, as I had my first date with my husband at 300.   I like how, if you get attached to a menu item, chances are good that it will be available for years to come (as long as it's not a special). They introduce new things, but they keep a healthy selection of favorites. My favorite is a side. Their potato salad is perfect, in my book. Flavorful (garlic-y) but not overly so, on the drier side, not tangy, super fresh, and they use red potatoes. It goes exceptionally well with their genius Avocado BLT. They do a great job on salads, and I enjoy their hummus too. Desserts are usually delicious.  They have a charming little patio. You can watch and listen to birds as you dine under the large tree in front of what was once a family home on East Boulevard. Inside, there are two floors. The first floor has a fireplace, and the cutest, coziest bar. Upstairs is open to below and very quaint.   I always experience good service. Staff is laid back, friendly, and effective.  The only things I don't love about 300 East is that the interior can get very loud, and just about all of the seats are very uncomfortable. The booths are made of old, very shallow benches whose backs are stick-straight. The space in each booth is super small and very cramped. The tables and chairs are more comfortable, but they're placed very close to each other - - cramped again. The restaurant is supposed to feel kind of shabby and casual, but I think it goes a little too far sometimes. Their tablecloths are always a bit worn and tired-looking. Overall, not a huge deal.  It pleases me to know that, throughout times of vast and frequent change, 300 East is still around, still serving fresh, comforting, delicious dishes.",

The staff was as friendly and nice as any and the ambiance low-key and relaxed at least on this night.   The options of edibles was vast and so varied that I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to try, so my date and I started with the housemade pimento cheese with crackers and veggies, which didn't come with enough veggies for my liking but I'll let that slide given the excellence of the cheese.  Next up was dinner - the options wildly varied in my opinion but all of it sounded(and smelled) amazing. I had the fusilli with hot sausage which was quite good I must say, but the sauce itself could use a little more flavor in it I think. My date chose the sweet potato ravioli covered with gorgonzola and toasted walnuts which was freaking awesome, never expected that - I wish I had gone that route myself kinda.  I can't wait to visit again to try quite a few of the other menu options, along with the Matilda Wong I've heard so much about.

Overall, good upscale casual dining, but a long ways from greatness.",

What set the night off in a bad direction right from the start was the service. When I made the reservation I mentioned it was for our anniversary. No mention when we got there (no big deal, but strike 1). Our waitress was clearly wishing she was somewhere else. Didn't tell us her name, welcome us, just started off asking what we wanted.  Definitely not well trained or just didn't care.  When our main course came she didn't stop by to take our salad plates but just moved things around and made it fit, even though we had finished. But then took 10 mins to finally clear them.  Strike 2.  Halfway through dinner, very large cockroach was cruising across the floor. Strike 3.  Once you see that while you're eating it just doesn't sit well from that point on.  The food, despite the horrible service was decent, but not great.   Might give it a try again, but if we get the same waitress I will request to change.",

I loved the quaint and homey feel of this restaurant. They have outdoor and indoor seating. The service was great and everything on their menu sounded delicious. I could tell they really cared about using fresh ingredients. The wait was a little longer than average about 20 mins , but it was okay and the waitress kept us updated! The food was great. I definitely would recommend this place and can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "300 East is a really cute, quaint little spot. The ambiance is nice for a business dinner, or a low-key date night. I ordered French onion soup as an appetizer and it was phenomenal. Following that, I was served the braised lamb & mushroom ragout that I ordered ... I'll assume that this dish is an acquired taste. I was dining with two \"what's the flavor profile on that\" type foodies and none of us could understand the objective of this dish. Ravioli filled potent goat cheese, topped with some sort of savory lamb meat sauce and lemon-mint-goat cheese butter. It sounded interesting on paper, but the flavors didn't marry well in my mouth. I sent it back and got a burger with bacon, cheddar, and gorgonzola. I'm not typically one to go ordering burgers at nice restaurants, but I have ZERO regrets. That burger was among the best I've ever tasted. I chose a potato cake as my side and it was also delicious. My friends both order crab cakes which were also delicious. As tasty as all those things were, though, they all paled in comparison to the desserts. One friend got the cheesecake, which was so moist, so light, and so fresh that I could taste the ricotta. Sooo good! And I was served a surprise birthday brownie, for which I have no words. Needless to say, it was delightful. Overall, we were all pleased with this place.",

I went with my boyfriend and the wait for 2 people at 11:30am was 45 min - 1 hour. That's understandable, but the hostess was completely disorganized and unhelpful. It seemed like she couldn't care less if we were seated or not. Luckily our server was more friendly, but the service was so slow!!! On top of that, my eggs Benedict were cold. At that point I didn't want to complain because I knew it would take forever to get it resolved. I ended up leaving finally at 1:45... longest most mediocre brunch I've had in Charlotte. Please do better on Sunday's and hire some nicer people!!!",

Reservations are recommended for brunch & weekend dinner. We came for brunch & got there when it opened since all reservations were full. There's upstairs dining & also a small outdoor patio. We felt like we had the best seat in the house because we were facing the front, where it's all windows over looking East. Reading the brunch menu, it was almost impossible for me to pick what I wanted-because I wanted to try everything! Luckily my husband let me eat a little bit of his grits bowl (basically a build your own deal w/4 topping limit) where you can't go wrong. I got the crab cakes Benedict. Oh man. The crab cakes were Maryland style (the only correct kind in my opinion), the potato cakes were like a hash brown casserole smushed together (my favorite) & the hollandaise was so rich but paired so well with the crab & potatoes. It was so freaking good. Staff were also attentive & friendly. Can't wait to try the dinner menu!",

Whoever I was transferred to (I'm assuming the bartender) literally said \"when we are busy at brunch, I don't feel like doing takeout orders so I'm not doing them right now.\" Clearly that's great customer service. Instead of saying something along the lines of being too busy to take any takeout orders, etc...that was his response. Not that it may have any impact but this short interaction is enough to leave this review immediately after getting of the phone and never recommend this place to anyone I know or come into contact with.   Update: (since I can't respond to the response on this for some reason) YES...that is exactly what was said, it was noisy, but came across extremely clear. There was no miscommunication, which is the reason why I hung up the phone after the rudeness. Thank you for responding, however, it may help if there was more sincerity. Either way, thanks!",

    "text": "Great food; poor service  I've been dying to try 300 East since I moved to Charlotte; however, after brunch, I am unsure if I will return soon.   My girlfriends and I wanted to hit a Sunday brunch in Dilworth yesterday, so we figured 300 East would be the perfect spot. Luckily there were still reservations available via OpenTable, so I snagged one of those.   Even after I checked-in for our reservation we wound up waiting a little while for a table to become available. This is one thing that irks me when dining out because I made a reservation for a reason. I understand a restaurant doesn't have control over how fast people eat or if they are just lounging.   We are seated upstairs, which is super cute. I didn't even know there was an upstairs! After we sat down our waiter came over in a huff and it seemed like she was ready to go home. She asked if we wanted anything besides water and we declined. She came back 15 minutes later with water, and just stood there- we took this as a cue that she wanted us to order. As we were going to say we needed more time, she started offering appetizers as suggestions, but we again declined and asked for a few minutes (a few minutes, doesn't mean 15 minutes, just a few). So, 15 minutes later, she comes back, we order. I got the breakfast pizza but asked to swap the chorizo out for arugula and she kept saying things like I'll have to check, why do that, I'm not sure if we can. Well, she never checked and that's just how my pizza came. Veg friends, that's a great option if you are having breakfast here.   35 minutes later our food came out. Two tables came and left in the time from when we were seated to when we were waiting for our food. The table next to us even ordered before us and didn't eat their's until we were halfway finished. I did hear the gentleman inquire about their food and their waiter mentioned that something was taking them a while to cook- as their food came out I glanced over and they ordered nothing over the top for brunch - eggs benny, a salad, breakfast pizza, waffles.   ANYWAY- back to my table - my friends both ordered the waffles and we very pleased with them. As we were eating, the waitress came back and asked if we wanted boxes - we were clearly still eating, and that's what we said.  That was awkward because we weren't finished and now I felt hurried to get out. The strangest thing about this, they had a handful of empty tables upstairs. I didn't feel as if there was a reason for us to finish our meal so quickly.   Needless to say, the service left a bad taste in my mouth, but that was washed away with every savory bite of my breakfast pizza. The food is worth the visit. I will come back for dinner and drinks, but maybe on a slow day.  **The review really is a 3.5, but Yelp only allows full stars*",

    "text": "Great Eclectic Menu in a restored Dilworth Home  Talked my wife into driving into Charlotte after Church in Davidson for Sunday Brunch. One place I have been wanting to try for Brunch is 300 East which needless to say, is located at 300 East Blvd in the Dilworth Neighborhood. Dilworth was Charlotte first Suburban Neighborhood and dates back to the 1890's.  They have done a beautiful job restoring and re purposing original structures in the area restoring many to private residences and others in professional offices.  300 East is one of those structures.  A word or warning and I know better. Irregardless of when you are going, make a reservation. They will not turn you away but it reduces your wait.  Did not occur to us to make a reservation before we left Davidson so when we checked in, were told it was going to be like 35 minutes.  We chose to wait and it did not take 35 minutes till we had a table but folks with reservations generally were seated with almost no wait. Another thing, they have a policy of not seating patrons till all of the party is present.  We had a nice table by the window. Our seats were probably the ministers and bishops seats in an old Church and made for a great seating.  Menu is constantly changing so it is always fresh and new and I must admit, very creative.  We started with water which is unusual for me but for some reason, I was very thirsty today. After that, my wife had a Bellini and I had a very nice rich and robust coffee.  This restaurant is known for it's Soup. Soup of the day was Lamb Noodle but my wife went with the Standard French Onion Soup  Rather than entree, she ordered a Fall Salad which was full of berries and nuts characteristic of the fall all on a bed of Arugula and other mixed greens with a Balsamic Dressing  The Frittata of the day was a lamb Frittata with Feta Cheese and other goodies. Not sure where the Citrus notes came from however.  My wife then did something she does not normally do and ordered a slice of the Carrot Cheesecake to take home.  The Brunch was a hit on all counts. French Onion Soup which is one of my wife's favorites was full and rich.  Salad was loaded with seasonal favorites and my Frittata was one of the best I have ever had although I must admit, I had never had one made with Lamb.  Definitely someplace we will visit again although making reservations first.  Service was outstanding and atmosphere was nice although a bit crowded and an above average noise level.",

I got the special Lemon Meringue French Toast which had a LOT going on, but it was good and enough to bring leftovers home. Friends got the Breakfast pizza which was great and sizeable, Breakfast burrito, also sizeable, and the Crabcake Benedict which was a little smaller and had two sunny side up eggs on it. They probably would let you sub a different style egg. Had the Pineapple Mimosa and the Peach Bellini...both good. All in all, we will be back to try more.

The goat cheese appetizer tasted like a stove (maybe something had burned in it recently??), and the ravioli (which is now only 4 medium sized pieces) was not cooked properly. It was either not cooked all the way, or it was cooked earlier in the day and reheated. The sauce was very thin and drippy, with little to no taste of gorgonzola. Service was terrible and rushed; not due to the server, but due to the fact that she was covering almost the entire upstairs herself! It's not like a crowd during restaurant week should surprise the managers- I don't know what was going on here.",

First, the service we got was SUUUUUUPER slow. We ordered a few salads and a BLT and it took upwards of 30-40 minutes for our food to come out.   The waiter also rarely came and checked on us, to refill drinks etc, though we saw him tend to other tables in our area of the restaurant frequently.   Once our food *finally* came, we were disappointed to say the least. The salads had MINIMAL toppings on them, it was sad to even call them salads. My friend that got the BLT said it tasted good, but I didn't try it so I can't speak on that. It didn't look to gourmet/tasty though. Looked like something you could quickly whip up at home.   We came to this restaurant starving and left still pretty hungry. We would have ordered more food, but we were afraid it would be another 45 min until we got anything else.   Can't say I'm going to come back!",

After one disappointing experience, I will typically visit a restaurant again just to make sure I didn't catch them on an \"off\" day.  Unfortunately, I was only in town for a weekend.    Atmosphere:  It's in a house that's been converted to a restaurant.  I loved that it had that homey feel to it while not feeling drab.  You can tell that the owner put a lot of thought into finding that right balance between comfort and not feeling too living room-ey.    Service:  We had a reservation, so we were seated right as we arrived.  Our waitress offered food suggestions for what she thought we'd like (more on that later).  She was prompt, friendly, and informative.  No complaints there.  Food: It was okay.  I've definitely had better.  I ordered a fried catfish dish.  Being in NC, I was expecting this to blow me away...or at least come a little close.  It was bland as all get out!  It came with chips and those were semi stale/soggy.  I ordered the dessert special for the day, the sourgum molasses cookie with butterscotch ice cream and bruleed pineapple as a garnish.  The way the waitress described it had my mouth watering.  The ice cream and cookie were a great combination.  There was just something \"off\" about the entire composition of the dish though.    I really wanted to like 300 East, but maybe next time.",

I booked a reservation for Sunday brunch because I really hate waiting around for a table and when we arrived at 300 East, even though we were early, the hostess brought us right to a table despite others who had arrived ahead of us without a reservation. The food was excellent. I really enjoyed my crabcake benedict. Lots of crabmeat! The cheese grits were excellent. The coffee was good. My wife really enjoyed her meal as well. and especially her peach fizz.  Bad... Service was slow. The food took a long while to appear and when it did, it was not very hot. Barely warm. But we *hate* sending food back and so we both dug in rather than complain. The wait for our check was a long one.. There was a big chip in my water glass on the lip. $2.75 for a refillable cup of coffee. Really.  The food was great but I can't really say that I would go back.",

    "text": "After we saw 300 East on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\", my wife and I decided to try it. We went to their Sunday brunch for eggs benedict and shrimp and grits. The place was chic and unique. Our server was friendly.   Unfortunately, our food took a while to come out and it was served cold.  Our waitress asked us if we wanted it warmed up or made fresh again. Not sure why but we waited for the fresh.   Our second order came out faster and served hot. The shrimp and grits was creamy with the perfect amount of seasoning. The eggs benedict was good. The muffin was burnt black on the edge though. For our trouble, our waitress did bring us some beignets with a peach and butter dip. Yes, those were good.  Overall I expected more but I enjoyed our visit.",

Maybe we ordered wrong for a Saturday lunch (note: no brunch menu offered on Saturdays), but my black bean and green chile chicken tortilla came divided up into individual sectors of beans, chicken, cheese, with a slice of avocado on top--it was a weird DIY burrito, essentially, and lacked any sort of spice or flavor.  My girlfriend's pimento sandwich was decent but nothing special.  The iced coffee was terrible (definitely yesterday's old coffee refrigerated overnight).    I also rarely notice something as simple as paint, but it was impossible not to here--we came on an incredibly sunny day, but they sat us upstairs and the tacky dark mauve color scheme just sucked all the light out of the air somehow.  The sun was shining and the windows are plenty big, and yet it felt like we were eating in grandma's basement decorated in the 70s.  A new, lighter paint job would make it so much more pleasant!  Extra star for very friendly service from the waitress upstairs--but I'd pass otherwise.",

    "text": "This was our pick of many we researched for brunch. It really helped that it's a Diners Drive Ins and Dives location. We drove up and were immediately pleased by how adorable it was then we were not sure of parking. The parking lot in the back had tow signs everywhere and had reserved signs for another business but we called and the restaurant said it was fine to park there. We walked in and it was packed but we put our name in and sat at the bar. We took advantage of their bloody Mary's and mimosas that were being offered. Really good! We also ordered a warm goat cheese dip to nibble on. It had roasted garlic and sundried tomatoes and was served with a baguette. It was delicious! Right as we wrapped up our drinks and appetizer our table was ready.  We moved upstairs to our table that was in a dim lit area that was extremely cozy. Our sever greeted the table and explained a few of the specials. They had a stuffed French toast with blueberry ice cream and a sparkler. We almost went for it but I really wanted to try their grit bowl. Stone ground grits with 3-4 (can't remember) options for toppings but you could add more for 75 cents each. I ordered mine with queso fresco, crumbled chorizo (not greasy), tomatoes, chives and chilies. In all honesty I ordered too many toppings. I wish there would have been more grits.  My husband ordered Belgium waffles with berries and vanilla maple syrup and locally sourced bacon.  He loved it. I had a few bites as well and it was fantastic! All in all it was a great meal!!!! I would highly suggest it!",

Then the host preceded to tell me they did not take reservations or call ahead seating. When I arrived at the resturant the first thing the host asked me was if I made a reservation! The rudeness of the front of house staff was outrageous! I would not recommend this place. If that's what the hosts are like, who knows how bad the rest of the place is.",

It is an old house that was converted to a restaurant - this causes the acoustics to be a bit loud.    There is a bar downstairs where you can eat if they are too crowded to seat you for a bit.  When I was here recently I thoroughly enjoyed their special drink the 'Matilda Wong'!  It comes in a larger glass - formulated from their special mix.  It is addictive!  Perfect compliment to brunch - especially on a sunny day if you are sitting outside.  The outside patio area is small but there is a nice fountain and you can look out over East blvd traffic.  Very nice on a sunny day!  The food is very good - I always get the brunch specials.  The chef is always full of surprises.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service is super friendly and quick.

    "text": "My first trip to 300 East was about 10 years ago, long before I used yelp. And I vaguely remember liking it, which is why, while visiting my folks in Charlotte, I decided to take them there for lunch. Money and time well-spent.   The food was exceptional. Start off with the fact that, for the small size of this restaurant, they had at least 20 wines by the glass. And one was an Albarino. I don't know many restaurants that have that wine by the glass at all.   Started with chips and guacamole. I have no idea what the seasoning was concocted with, but I was scraping the bowl. I usually don't behave this way in public.  My mother's chicken salad was so-so, but good. Dad had the Sonoma Salad. Produce was unbelievably fresh and ranch dressing was made fresh moments before it was brought to us. You can taste that kind of detail. But the real compliment I have for this establishment was my chicken, bean, and green chile tortilla. Perfect amount of rice and beans on the bottom, topped with lettuce, chicken, salsa fresca, and a dab of sour cream. Beautiful presentation. Good service.  This place has been around for over 25 years, and my old friend once told me that she liked everything on the menu. They have a reputation that is well-deserved.",

    "text": "This is a staple in Charlotte's \"American\" restaurant scene. Somehow I have never eaten here until recently. First visit was for brunch a few months ago. It was a good brunch. Portion was generous for the price. Best part was the Maltida Wong pitcher. Between the cocktail, the historic house and the pretty dishes, it was a glorious morning.  Fast forward to November, after much consideration, I decided to take my parents here for Mom's birthday dinner. The main appeal is the easy menu that fits everyone's palate. My parents, who don't go out much, enjoyed the ambience. Something is very nice about a cozy old home serving as restaurant.  We ordered the Bronzed Sesame Salmon ($16), Grilled Hanger Steak ($18) and Seared Ahi Tuna Salad ($14.25). We also started with the French Onion Soup ($6.25). Overall the food was good. Mom liked the salmon but it looked a little plain to me. Dad's steak was the best of the three dishes. My salad was good, but I think they could have given me more than 2 thin slices of tuna for that price. But for the quality of food and the price, I was happy with the dinner.  Best yet, they knew it was my mom's birthday and brought out a complimentary brownie sundae. It turned out to be the highlight of the dinner. We're not much of a sweet tooth, but the brownie was delicious and the vanilla ice cream was creamy & rich.   Just so you all know how satisfied I was with that night's dinner: it was Panthers Monday Night game against the Patriots that night, and I didn't feel as bum out after the dinner and sundae (and don't forget half price glass of wine)!",

We were early for our reservation by about 15 minutes, but we were quickly seated at a nice corner table upstairs near the railing.  My wife got the Signature St. Germain to drink, and I went off-menu and asked for an old fashioned - both were excellent, if a bit overpriced ($10.50 each).  The baked marinated goat cheese was fantastic, and the baguette they bring you to eat it with is huge for 2 people.  My wife got the hanger steak, and it was a little bit overcooked (she asked for medium rare, and there was hardly any pink in part of it), but it was so tender from being marinated that it was still awesome - I know because she let me have a bite. :)  I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  In short, it's a very charming setting, the service was fast and outstanding, the waiter was very knowledgeable.  We'd go back in a heartbeat - based on the reviews here, I think we'll go for brunch next time.",

I liked the food but didn't  love it.  Maybe  because what I ordered is food that most people can cook.   But I didn't expect jam and jelly in a little plastic package. We were seated upstairs in a nook which was quite cozy but all around us was chaos.  The place was packed.  The staff were very nice and friendly, but it was just really hectic and did I mention it was packed, I mean packed, not a bad thing to be busy at all but I felt like it took away from the experience as I felt part of the conversation in the party of 10 five inches from our table.   It was a baby shower.",

    "text": "We don't head down into Charlotte itself too often, but this Restaurant Week left us with a desire to explore outside out comfort zone in Lake Norman (plus the fact that we've hit every location in Lake Norman that participates in Restaurant Week.) 300 East's menu sounded pretty good, and the fact that wine was included with the meal made it a must. We made reservations via Open Table and then headed down last night to chow down.  300 East is a small little restaurant that is quite cozy. We arrived on time and were promptly greeted and seated. The dining area has some tight quarters so it was louder than I would have liked a nice restaurant to be. Our server was kind of \"meh\" in that he didn't really have much personality and seemed rushed, which is very possible with it being Restaurant Week and the place was packed to capacity.   I didn't glance at the main menu since we were there for Restaurant Week, but that particular menu was pretty solid. For wine I got the Pinot Grigio and the miss' had the Merlot. Both were pretty good, considering they were probably not the best in house since they were being included with the meal.   For an appetizer I went with the crab cakes, and they were pretty good. I got two decent sized cakes that were definitely more crab than filler, which is always a good thing. They weren't too heavy either and came with a tasty sauce, roasted corn (which was an excellent topping to go with the crab) and some lettuce. It was a good appetizer and a great way to start the meal. The miss' went with the hummus, and her portion was huge. They gave her a generous bowl of hummus that was pretty darn good, and it came with some carrot and celery sticks and a ton of hot, fresh pita chips. The pita and hummus combo was really good, and I almost liked the hummus more than the crab cake.   For dinner I went with the hanger steak. This bad boy was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and had a great overall flavor. I never had hanger steak before so I can't compare to previous meals, but it was slightly tough...not as tender as a ribeye would be. The steak was smothered in a horseradish sauce that wasn't bad at all, but very good. I was nervous about it since I'm not a huge fan of horseradish, but it was such a light note to the overall sauce that I enjoyed it. The steak was also topped with some onions, and that always makes a steak better! The steak came with mashed potatoes that were decent but nothing to write home about. BUT THE GREEN BEANS!!! I don't think I've ever ranted about a green veggie, and I doubt the next time will come too soon, but these damn green beans were freaking fantastic! They were cooked perfectly for me, and still had a firm snap to them. They were cooked in some kind of salt/butter/garlic sauce that was simply divine. The butteriness of the sauce definitely made it feel a bit sinful, but hey, I was eating veggies and loving it, so it's all good.   The miss' had the sweet potato ravioli, and talk about sinful, these things were like a cheesy, creamy paradise. The ravioli themselves had a perfect texture to them, and the potato filling was great. The sauce was the kicker, and it was a rich, creamy, heavy gorgonzola-based sauce. We both agreed that it was tastetacular, but at the same time it was too much. There was so much sauce it was almost like a soup, and it was so rich that she couldn't eat too much of it before feeling full. If there was less sauce for the ravioli to swim in it would probably be a much better dinner option.  For dessert I ordered the white chocolate brioche pudding, and this thing was great. It was a lot more custardy than other bread puddings I've had down here, so I think I was missing the texture of other bread puddings. Yet the flavors were spot on, and as I ate more of it and thought of it more like an actual pudding I enjoyed it more. The white chocolate flavor ran throughout, and the dessert was topped with these tiny espresso chips that brought a snap to the dish. The miss' went with the sweet potato cheesecake which wasn't overly rich, as far as cheesecakes go. The sweet potato flavor was great, and it was topped with these tasty crispy sweet potato crispy to offer some texture.   Despite a few minor issues, 300 East provided a solid dining experience. I wouldn't be against a return visit at all, but with it being out of the way for us I don't know when we would make it down again. One last note...be careful when going to the restroom. It's a sneaky riddle you must solve in order to know which door leads to the men's and which is for the women-folk.",

The place definitely fills up fast but with the help of opentable you can get a reservation and get a seat. There is a small bar that fills up but the bartenders are great.

Dim lighting, close together tables and warm colored walls. The waitstaff were good about filling up your water and also getting food to you in a timely manner.  I had the hummus, veggies & pita for my 1st course, followed by this phenomenal Winter Farro Salad, and finished off with some Rosemary-infused apple crisp. So amazing. The Farro Salad consisted of farro (a hearty, healthy grain) tossed with kale, butternut squash and mushrooms. There was just the right amount of oil and seasoning added to balance out the textures and flavors. Then the apple crisp- oh me oh my. The rosemary made all of the flavors in your average apple crisp pop. It was fantastic. Definitely recommend checking it out.",

We tend to visit on Wednesdays and Sundays, but since we live 2 blocks away, we are likely to drop in any time. As a vegetarian, I enjoy having plenty of options on the menu and we love to know much of the food is local.  As regulars, we are usually treated well by most of the staff, as with any place some are friendlier than others; the chef doesn't offer up a warm and fuzzy disposition and has barked at me once or twice. When we go for brunch, we sometimes request one of our regular menu items. It's odd that some days they will accomodate and other times they refuse.   All in all, we appreciate being close to a place with a nice ambience and great food, but perhaps a little more attention to recognition of regular customers goes a long way in a small community.",

I no longer live in Charlotte but I don't go back without eating at 300 East.  One of the first things you'll notice about 300 East is its charm.  The restaurant was converted out of an old house.  It may sound weird, but it works!  The space has two levels and is very authentic.  There is also an outdoor seating area that is perfect for summer evenings.  When you open the menu you'll find that there are some unique options to choose from.  They're all delicious.  My favorite is the usual.  That's what it's call: The Usual.  It's some of the best chicken salad I've ever had!  Of course they have a good selection of alcoholic beverages to choose from.  And like the neighborhood itself, the liberal, off-beat staff is happy to recommend something for you.  If you're the type of person who appreciates charm, authenticity, and good food, then go to 300 East!  You can thank me later.",

There's a great patio outside for those nice nights or cool Sunday morning brunches. They always seem to have a few specials on the chalkboard when you walk in, so make sure you check that out before sitting down, though the staff will tell you about them as well.  Usually go with \"The Usual\", which is a open faced tuna sandwich with cheese, asparagus and mushrooms...surprisingly good. It's under $10, which is nice, thought it doesn't come with any sides. OK by me, but just letting you know. They have great appetizers including the sweet potato ravioli and goat cheese. Pimento cheese is just ok. The few pizzas they offer have a nice variety too. My favorite meal I had there was the buttermilk fried chicken. If this was on the menu permanently, I'd probably visit more.  Great spot for a low-key date night and/or relaxing dinner.",

I was here once before during Restaurant Week, but it's so much nicer without the crowds. Their bar downstairs, especially, is much nicer when you are there by choice rather than waiting for a table. Although a heavy pour of Hendrick's can right a lot of wrongs.  We were seated upstairs both times, and I love the decor up there. It's not flashy or distracting, just a lot of small paintings that are much better than your usual mass-produced \"art\". Great neighborhood, building, booths, waitstaff, everything.  Everything except the food. I never quite know what to do about the food. The menu is muddled - Tacos, Filet Mignon, Burritos, Ravioli  - which no doubt gives great variety for the casual lunch crowd, but at dinner it robs the meal of cohesion. That might seem a strange complaint, but their menu is a strange experience. The food itself isn't bad (especially the local blackberry and peach cobbler) but it's such a hodgepodge that I have trouble enjoying it.",

    "text": "300 East is a lovely little spot with massive front windows, letting in copious amounts of light into this front-room dining room of an old house. Along the walls are tall wood-backed booths, and a small yet cozily dark bar is set in the middle toward the back. How perfect to sit on a sunny day for brunch!  My man had his heart set on the French Onion soup, based on his many past visits here when he lived in Charlotte. And it did not disappoint: a thick coverlet of bubbly brown-edged cheese guarded a perfectly flavorful broth and a layer of soaked bread and ribbons of satiny onions. We shared a couple of other dishes: the Fall Salad and the Avocado BLT. The Fall Salad arrives with a pancetta dressing: perfectly salty with a hint of light vinegar and pepper, for drizzling over nice fluffy dollops of goat cheese, port-soaked cherries, pine nuts, and nice spring mix. The BLT was standard issue but with fresh, simple ingredients: huge slices of avocado, crispy bacon, and toasted golden bread.  Oh, and mimosas....If you're in a group, do as an observed table did and order your bottle of Prosecco and a pitcher of orange juice to mix as you choose.   All in all, a good meal: fresh, simple, bright, and a few nice community touches like information about local dog rescues taped up in the entry. Speaking of dogs, let's just say the restroom door gender identifiers involve two wooden St. Bernards: the female is in profile, and so is the male. With additional equipment....Takes a minute to figure it out, and might be a great way to initiate certain conversations with your kids. Or not....  If I had the option, this would be a three-and-a-half star review (maybe dinner and slightly more intense and creative ingredients would up that to four). If you're looking for fresh, seasonal food in Charlotte and want a slightly upscale yet comfortable atmosphere with a varied and not-too-heavy menu, 300 East is your place to go! And return to, apparently....",

Can't remember what my wife had, but she liked it a lot. She does not eat meat and it was nice to be in a restaurant with lots of choices for her. The service was as exceptional as I remembered. And we still enjoy looking on East Blvd., one of the coolest streets in Charlottay! We'll be back there soon!",

What transpired was one of the greatest tragedies of our time.  I was not all that hungy, so I ordered a salad.  It was probably good, but I don't remember because my wife was accross the table with a thick juicy steak melting in her mouth.  She did not share because it was that good and I had apparently given her enough indication that I didn't want meat...poor choice.  To add injury to insult, behind my wife, at the table beyond, sat a couple of Gentlemen, one of whom was dressed like Elton John.  To this day, she recalls this as the best steak she has ever had.  It may or may not be True, but all these years later, The Steak, Elton John, and the quircky name/find of 300 East sticks out in the mind.  Enjoy!",

I have come to 300 East to celebrate birthdays, promotions, anniversaries, etc. It's in a quaint old Dilworth home so it feel like you are truly eating a home cooked gourmet meal. Be sure to make a reservation- if you dont, you might wait a while. The bar is full service so I've had appetizers and cocktails there while waiting for a table. The cocktails are unique and delicious. Appetizer- have to try the butternut squash ravioli (the sauce is so yummy they provide you a slice of fresh bread with it to soak up whatever sauce remains after you eat the ravioli). The baked goat cheese appetizer is also a must try. The goat cheese is baked with garlic and is spreadable on the bread they provide. Yum! Entrees- specials are always really good and different. Never the same. My favorite entrees are the crab cakes and the Gorgonzola filet. The crab cakes come with a delicious aioli and yummy chunky mashed potatoes. The filet is always a good choice and not overly expensive. Also comes with the mashed potatoes. Dessert- get the brownie sundae. Super chocolatey and served with homemade ice cream. The service is always impeccable. This place will always hold a special place in my heart for its charm!",

I got a cup of coffee and a mimosa, both of which were very good. (Mimosas, bellinis and bloody Marys are only $3.50!). To start we ordered the pimento cheese which was delicious and came with veggies and pita. My friend got the breakfast pizza and I got the grits bowl. The pizza was huge- we couldn't finish it but not for lack of trying. When you order the grits bowl they give you a list of things you can add to it and you get to pick 4. I went the Mexican route and got queso fresco, salsa, bacon and an egg... there were no leftovers for this dish :)",

I ordered the fried chickpea pita [they called it something else more interesting...but believe me, it was a pita]. It contained grilled avacado, Tahiti, pickled something, tomatoes and arugula. Oddly enough even with all of that...it was so very bland.  I had to add a ton of salt and pepper and it was still missing flavor. It seemed to need something to brighten it up such as an acid or another sauce such a tadziki perhaps. My spouse ordered a burger which again had no real flavors that grabbed your attn. It needed salt badly! The wine was good and our waitress was very attentive and pleasant..but lets be honest people...the food should be the star of any dining experience, everything else should play a supporting role.

It is made with rum, gin, cherry brandy and a few other things and is served in a small pitcher with fruit garnish and a straw.   They also limit you too 2, which you should be feeling this after 1 but it's worth ordering 2.  They are sooooo good.    Other than that 300 East is another gem in Charlotte. It's in a wonderful location and it's a fun place.  The decor still contains remnants of the house that it used to be.  They have unique booths which a tall person like myself would find difficult to sit in.  Food-wise, they have a very diverse menu consisting of sandwiches, salads, and various entrees.  One of my favorites is the Hangar steak and I'm not normally a steak eater.   They also have wonderful brunches and the desserts are to die for.  But if you don't go there to eat, at least go for the Matilda Wong!!!",

While not McDonald's-casual, it's a casual setting in an historic house, and the prices are very reasonable for its Dilworth address.  The menu is very contemporary.  They have traditional American items with a gourmet twist.  Their Ahi Tuna Burger is delicious (and for only about $10, it's a great deal), but I usually stick to soup and salad, as 300 East has a soup-and-salady feel to me.  The Soup of the Day (you can't go wrong no matter what it is) and Seared Ahi Tuna Salad (do you see a recurring theme here?) make a great, light combination.  And don't forget to add on their specialty Matilda Wong drink (you're only allowed two!).    Try to sit in a high-backed booth or outside on their nicely decorated terrace.  The booths provide an intimate dinner experience for you and a loved one or a small group of friends and the terrace allows you to enjoy the fresh air and relaxing atmosphere.  At least until some hoopty happens down East Blvd, spouting smoke and blaring music.",

They even offered gluten free crackers instead of the pita points with the Roasted Goat Cheese dish, which was amazing, by the way!   Had a delicious bacon-wrapped filet and finished with a  piece of gluten free cheesecake.   Meal was perfect in EVERY Way! Thank you, 300 East!",

I also tried the burger with bacon and pimento cheese and a jalapeno grit cake. Both were awesome too. Burger wasn't over cooked and the bacon was generous, could've used more pimento but was still good. The grit cake was crunch and soft in the center, all over delicious. Will come back when in visiting Charlotte again!",

A bottle of red was very nicely paired for us as a recommendation from Nick. And then we finished it off with the carrot cheesecake. The ambiance was pleasant as was the view of the cityscape through the front window.  We wanted a quiet evening to dine and visit and that's exactly what we got.  We were very pleased with our entire experience.   Thanks 300 East.",

They have half priced bottles of wine on Wednesdays and a super cute patio area so 300 East was at the top of our list.  I ordered the Shrimp BLT Panini with jalapeno grit cakes and it was delicious. I'd recommend this restaurant for anything from brunch, to a girl's night to date night and everything in between. The \"fine-dining\" menu combined with the casual yet eclectic Dilworth vibe make it one of my new favorite spots. I'll definitely be back -- I hear they have a killer brunch menu! :)",

The service was kind of slow hence the deduction of the star but it was super busy even on a Wednesday night so definitely make a reservation if you are coming here!  Came here a second time because my friends and I just had to try their brunch! I got the crabcakes Benedict and it was delicious. The crabcake was moist and the egg was perfectly cooked. It also came with a potato cake and it was amazing! I wish I had room to finish it. My one critique is I wish it came with roasted broccolini rather than asparagus but that is just a personal preference.",

Luckily, I was able to make a reservation for Sunday brunch on Open Table. a lot of places don't let you make a reservation for brunch, so this was already a plus in my mind. ** side note, we were running a few minutes late, so we called and hostesses said they only hold tables for 5 minutes past your reservation time. So don't be late! We sat on the entry floor in a little table in the corner. This is a cozy place that is very welcoming. We ordered beignets and coffee to start. I had a grit bowl and I think everyone else ordered some form of eggs benedict. Everything was delicious, coffee and water never dipped very low. Our waitress was attentive. No complaints here. It's obviously, a little pricey, but you can get a sense of cost by viewing on the menu online prior to your visit.",

It was absolutely delicious.  Once we were seated I ordered the crab cake.  It came with mashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day which was broccoli.

I loved the grits bowl and the tiramisu French toast was as decadent as it sounds. The atmosphere was lovely and we felt good staying at the table and enjoying the meal. I would love to come back here the next time I am in Charlotte for sure. I wish I lived closer!",

This is my go-to place for a date night or if I just want to spend a little extra money for good food and a nice atmosphere.  Part of 300 East's charm is that it is in an old house. There is a fireplace, seating is upstairs and downstairs and the decor is very homey. The overall atmosphere is just very homey  and intimate and I love coming here. I got the pork chop when I was here most recently and it was so good! I definitely recommend! The pork chop sat upon a squash puree. It was so delicious! The side salad it came with was interesting though. I couldn't figure out if I liked it or didn't like it. It was shredded lettuce with grilled banana peppers.  I also recommend their main salads here. When I come for lunch that is usually what I get. They also frequently have specials. For instance we came on a Sunday night and we got half price bottles of wine!  I highly recommend giving 300 East a try! It is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is unique to most Charlotte restaurants and the price is very reasonable!",

    "text": "Birthday dinner date night with Restaurant Week July 2018. Glad I finally made it to this gem in an old home on the main drag in Dilworth. East parking and good service, but it was sitting in this intimate booth in the corner that gave us a memorable private experience on an otherwise busy Friday night.   I like a chilled cucumber soup in the summer, so this version with two shrimp on the side of the cup was a great start to the meal. Hanger steak cooked medium rare was super filling and a glass of red wine with the meal made this a real deal. We also really liked the sweet potato ravioli.   Admittedly, I took a chance on the watermelon tres leches and it was an interesting version by the chef, it just wasn't the right combination of flavors for my taste. Still glad I ordered it, as it was entertaining to see and we were stuffed from the rest of the meal.   Three cheers to 300 East! Female-owned restaurant that stands the test of time in ever-evolving Charlotte.",

    "text": "Sadly, I am updating my 5 star review from 2/14/17 (which I will leave below as well). SEE THE P.S. FOR A HAPPY ENDING.  I am not sure what is going on at 300 East, perhaps a management change, turnover in chefs, new/untrained servers, but our experience last night was dismal. We made a reservation for our anniversary and expected to have another wonderful dinner date to celebrate. We were soooo disappointed.  We were seated in an okay spot, so that wasn't a problem. Our server showed up in a timely fashion to take our drink order, and gave us an adequate answer when we asked for a wine recommendation between the 2 we were debating. She brought the wine, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. She said she would bring a wine chiller, but never did. We ordered the baked marinated goat cheese, which was under done (not \"melty\" the way we had it before), while the accompanying baguette was burned rather than toasted. The jalapeno potato cake was cold (chilled?), so we asked if that was intentional. Our server brought a replacement that was marginally warmer. Who knew our white wine would be warmer than the appetizers? The jalapeno potato cake was clearly pre-made and seemed to be little more than mashed potato mixed with something granular (cornmeal?) and scallions - no jalapenos at all. I think they just pulled it out of the fridge, removed the plastic wrap and briefly ran it under the broiler or torched a la creme brulee. Gross. On to the main courses . . . My husband got the gorgonzola-stuffed filet mignon and asparagus. The filet was perfectly rare, just as ordered. The asparagus was cold to the touch. My roast chicken was flavorful, but on the dry side. The pan gravy was reminiscent of KFC gravy that I had once in my youth - overly salty. Our server brought a second side of supposedly hot asparagus just as we finished our food. Despite our memories of divine desserts, we decided to cut our losses and go elsewhere for dessert and let our server know that. She hoped we were \"at least happy with her\", alas that was not the case since we had such exemplary service previously. Perhaps we expected too much, but had we only expected an average meal, this experience would still have fallen short of the mark.   P.S. We went to QUEEN CITY CRAFT AND GOURMET for the brownie with salted caramel ice cream dusted with crushed pretzels, as well as a couple glasses of 20 year old port - it was the perfect dessert. Plus, we chatted with the server about our anniversary dinner and she informed us later that the owner wanted to comp our dessert as an anniversary gift. Now THAT was a pleasant surprise!  From 2/14/17 My husband I got to sneak away for a rare date night and this was just what we needed. Our waiter was terrific and had some great recommendations from the wine list. Half-price bottles of wine are a good way to go on Sunday. Had we wanted a fun cocktail or a craft beer, 300 East is good for those as well. We started with the goat cheese, sun dried tomato and garlic appetizer (served hot with toasted bread). It was simple, fresh, and very good (a must IMO). My husband had the duck, with a side of kale. He might as well have licked the plate as he liked it a lot (though would have preferred it without the cherries). I enjoyed the roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked green beans. House made desserts were worth every calorie. 300 East isn't fancy, with it's oilcloth covered tables, but if great food and an unfussy atmosphere are what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed. Yum!",

That said, the atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is an old house with Victorian charm. Our waiter was friendly and quickly shared details of the restaurant's history and the special of the day: half priced glasses of wines. The server recommended appetizers and entrees that were featured on Guy Fieri's DD&D. We took his advice and enjoyed the French onion soup. We also e joyed the filet mignon with back and Gorgonzola. The bacon was undercooked but the streak was cooked well. The mashed potatoes were not great, rather underwhelming. My husband enjoyed the lamb and mushroom ragout with raviolis and my MIL enjoyed salmon over the wheat berry and veggie combo but she asked to take more than half to go and it was thrown out instead which was annoying. She literally ate 1/3 of the meal. My husband told them we were celebrating on the Open Table reservation and it was never acknowledged which was a little odd. All-in-all it was a nice evening and the wine special is a great deal.",

Last time I had it, it was so good, so juicy and I remember the bun being so great. This burger was sub par, not at all close to what a $14.75 burger should be. Bread was stale, burger was dry, and tomato looked awful. I took it off the bun and ate the burger plain. My husband told the waitress I was so disappointed, she apologized and said \"yeah that tomato does not look good\". We assumed she'd comp it, but nope.   I will think twice before going back.",

    "text": "The building that houses 300 East is nice - it's essentially an old house, which means that it's not your more typical open floor plan, and more specifically you don't get the ever increasing volume that is seen when the concrete floors and lack of padding all over creates an echo chamber all around you. Also, you may see a few tables here and there as you walk in. There are plenty more - up the stairs, around the corner, all over the place really.  Depending on when you arrive, it may be packed, so you could decide to make a reservation. We didn't, but were still able to sit rather quickly, which was nice. Unfortunately it just meant that we had a place to sit, and it took a while for anyone to come over, but that's okay, as we had a seat by the window.  After taking our order, which involved some of the specials of the day, we had to wait a while longer to get our drinks, and then a while longer to get them refilled. Also not a huge deal, but it is always a bit of an annoyance.  Regardless, the food eventually came - first an appetizer, which really looked like a scoop of cheese out of a tub (tasty cheese, but just a scoop from a tub nonetheless) and a couple of sliced veggies. A bit later, our orders. The soup of the day, and my sandwich.  Oddly enough, it wasn't the sandwich I actually ordered. It looked decent enough, but it wasn't what I wanted. The server - not our server, but the delivery server - seemed shocked that it wasn't what I ordered, and offered to bring out what I actually wanted. Since I did indeed want the original order, I asked if she would be so kind.  Several minutes later - after my wife's soup was just about gone - my sandwich was delivered. Strangely, with the wrong side. Apparently the special side that I had ordered was no longer available (it was allegedly available 15 minutes or so before when I ordered in the first place, but not on either the wrong sandwich, or the correct, replacement one).  So I asked for a different side and started in, because at this time, not only was my wife done, but we had somewhere to be. As I was halfway through my slightly overdone pita, the side finally arrived, which was probably decent, because it gave me something to eat on while we waited for the bill.  As the bill arrived, it wasn't the correct one, but the server (now the original one again) corrected it, and also gave us a discount for the troubles. Always a nice thing, but not having the troubles in the first place is always a better option - for the place and for us.  We did make it out, and made our schedule - but it might be a while before we come back. The food was reasonable enough, but the experience wasn't the greatest.",

The beautiful big windows in the front make for a beautiful brunch.   I had the eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce is always the complex item on the otherwise simple dish. This was was fantastic. It could have used more but that would be a personal preference rather than a culinary necessity. The potatoes were also really good with the right amount of salt and crispness.   The bloody mary could use some more love since it was just straight forward but nothing was missing by any means.",

Everything ordered was plenty tasty and filling, if not the best I've had. The Mediterranean salad was a meal in itself and worth any vegetarian's interest. On a whole I enjoyed the  the vegetables by far. The Scarlett turnips in the special we very well done though the Zaatur marinated chicken breast was dryer than I prefer. The flavors of the rice, lemon, pinenuts, satsuma orange slices, & turnip were quite good, though the oranges burned and didn't far as well as the other ingredients. The main course arrived well before I had finished my salad which made it cold eating unfortunately. Having never eaten in Charlotte NC, I can say I did not go away hungry. Plenty of food and tasty enough to warrant a return trip if in the city at a later date. It wasn't perfect but it was more than pleasant.",

They used to have an \"Unusual\" but it looks like that one is no longer regularly available. The setting is quaint and charming in a renovated old house and you must check out the cute signs that mark the bathrooms. A cozy full bar with a generous wine list is downstairs and there is seating upstairs, downstairs and on the patio out front. Lunch, dinner and brunch are served and a kids menu is available as well.  I recently enjoyed the homemade pimento cheese dip as well as a crab cake sandwich. I tried the gazpacho, which was more of a tomato soup with chunks of veggies rather than the blended variety that I like better. On another visit I tried the goat cheese appetizer - delicious with sun dried tomatoes and roasted garlic - and the aforementioned Sonoma salad with chicken - love the Dijon mustard dressing and the inclusion of red potatoes. Desserts are also tasty including the peach cobbler with ice cream that I sampled. 300 East truly has an eclectic menu with several unique salads, pizzas and Mexican inspired options as well as a full sandwich and entree menu. Vegetarians will find plenty including black eyed pea falafel and farro saute. Definitely a fun and different place to dine in Charlotte.",

The ambiance is still casual and cozy and service is typically on point and friendly. A few items I've snacked on recently that I much appreciate:  The Fall Salad: 4/5: This is my go-to. Direct from the menu it's: Port Soaked Cherries, Goat Cheese and Toasted Pine Nuts over Mixed Greens with Pancetta Dressing. The dressing doesn't really do it for me but, frankly, there are so many other delicious items nestled in this salad it doesn't seem to matter. The port soaked cherries and goat cheese make a beautiful match. Get it with chicken.   Sweet Potato Ravioli: 5/5: If you seek the most delicious, creamy, dreamy, not-good-for-you plate, get the sweet potato ravioli. It's what fat dreams are made of. Hell, it's what my dreams are made of.   Baked Goat Cheese Appetizer: 4/5: Um, yum. Tons of baked goat cheese with sun dried tomatoes and plenty 'o garlic. It's worth it. Save the mints for later.   Fish tacos: 3.5/4: For a change of pace, I dig the fish tacos. They're fresh and tasty, but nothing that blows me away. They fill the void of a dinner that's a bit of a lighter fare.   If you're never been to 300 East, I implore you to visit. There are just tons of great tasting items in this sweet little restaurant.",

My wife had the Ahi Tuna Salad and I had the burger with Onion Marmalade and Horseradish Cream.  Very good.  They follow the rules so they couldn't cook it medium rare.  Can't wait for that law to go away because the flavors in this would be great if the flavor wasn't grilled out of the meat!    We had a Warm Chocolate Brownie and it too was great.  It was 100 degrees that day so we opted for inside.  This is the perfect place to have a dinner or brunch outside if the temp is right.  Tip : Wednesday is 1/2 Bottles of wine.  They have a great Sangiovese.",

    "text": "As a member of the Matilda Wong society, I felt compelled to review old faithful... 300 East.  I love the atmosphere.  Who can't be enamored with this old house in the heart of Dilworth?  I am not sure if she (the house) is considered a Grand Dame by historians and architects but it certainly is by me!    I love sitting downstairs in one of the booths to the right of the hostess stand for a long leisurely lunch on a Saturday, that may, or may not, include a glass of wine.  I love coming here in the Fall and sitting outside, hearing the fountain and looking at the sheep statue.  I love coming here in the Winter and sitting in the really small and cozy booth in the main dining room.  Really, I cannot think of a time when it isn't right to come here!  The hummus plate is a delicious way to start your meal.  If you are lucky the white bean and gouda soup will be the daily soup offering.. it is bowl-licking good.  All the specials I have ever tried are delicious...  But, I tend to gravitate toward a salad or, my favorite, the black bean tortilla (with lots of fresh avacado!).  My hubbie likes the usual-- a grinder-ish type sandwich, the tuna, or whichever pasta is on the menu.  There is a special drink here called the \"Matilda Wong\"  and it is very, very wong.  It used to come in a smallish fishbowl (think beta fish) but is now served in a small pitcher.  When I say it is \"wong\", I mean it is strong, it is good for sharing but, plan on having a responsible driver.  They cut you off after 2, as they should.  I think I have aged out of the ability to even share one...  Nice wine list, half-priced wine nights.  This is a fun girls-night, or date night, or parents-are-in-town place.    -- funny to see your guests' reactions to the bathrooms--",

This situation was rectified last week when we dropped in for a dinner with a friend.   I immediately liked the place. I love restaurants in old houses, and 300 East is cozy without being uncomfortable. The decor is charming, with lots of gourds, beans, and such worked in. By the way, your first visit to the bathroom will be amusing.  Service was friendly and attentive (and, incidentally, attractive). We started with the pimento cheese appetizer, which was delicious. For my entree, I ordered the chicken green chili tortilla--again, tasty. Our friend's fusilli with Italian sausage was the best thing at the table. Now I know what I'll order next time. Don't you love it when things are easy like that? Oh, and the prices were downright reasonable.  I think we'll be back to 300 East in the near future.

Okay, I say this with hesitation....don't want too many people knowing this but... bellinis, mimosas, and bloody maries are all $3.50 on Sundays -- I'm going out on a limb here and saying -- lowest price brunch cocktail in the city. YUM.  The place was clearly slammed so service was a little slower than one would like, however our waitress, who was clearly busy, was always friendly and attentive to details like refilling waters and clearing old champagne flutes from the bellinis we gleefully guzzled.  When our food eventually came I was hungry and definitely ready to chow down. We all got the same thing -- crab cake benedict. YUM.  Arriving upon our plates and smelling fantastic was a huge crab cake, a large potato-chive cake, and bright asparagus (so tender and skinny with perfect light seasoning of salt and pepper.)  As if this wasn't glorious enough it was topped with two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs, and drizzled with citrus hollandaise. The extra \"citrus\" in the hollandaise gave it such a bright fresh appeal, so it doesn't feel so heavy.   I wanted to focus on the food, but cannot finish this review without speaking briefly on how quaint and charming the little Dilworth gem is on East Blvd. It is in an old house, and the booths feel extremely cozy and I could see how it would be romantic for a date night in the evening. Just make sure you go early, as this place will fill up for brunch pretty quickly. Enjoy!",

    "text": "We went on 11/8/17, thinking we wouldn't need reservations on a Wednesday evening for a party of two.  We were incorrect, and that's our fault.  We were directed to the bar, where the very friendly and attentive bartender informed us that Wednesday's special is half-price bottles of wine, any bottle on the menu.  That made the wait bearable!  The bar space is very crowded, and we were fortunate to find two chairs at the bar for our wait, but I suppose that's the price to be paid for an upscale restaurant in a converted house.  Though it felt a little tight, it was warm, inviting, and I loved the character of the place.  We elected to skip appetizers and just order dinner.  Contrary to a recent article in the New York Post warning people away from daily specials, I decided to try the special Salmon Cakes, which came on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and a side of green beans.  I also ordered a side of the special Grit Casserole.  My meal was amazing.  The salmon was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  The bread crumb crust, pan fried, subtly accented rather than overpowered the seasonings and the rich taste of the fish.  The pairing with the potatoes and green beans was perfect, and the grit casserole was very good.  My wife ordered the Man Baby pizza.  It was okay, but I wouldn't suggest ordering pizza there.  If she wants to write a review, she can.  My meal was excellent, but she had different thoughts with regard to her pizza. She did love the brussels sprouts!  However, any doubt she had was removed with our dessert - something we usually skip, but we decided to indulge for a special occasion.  We ordered the Callebaut Chocolate Brownie - served with Honey Chocolate Sauce, Salted Caramel, and Vanilla Bean Gelato.  It was absolutely decadent, and transcendent.  She asked me if it would be bad form if she licked the plate clean.  She wasn't kidding - she would do it.  I understood the sentiment, but I suspect that wouldn't be the vibe the owners were shooting for in their restaurant.  Not many upscale places want to resemble a pie eating contest at the end of the meal.    All in all, we will definitely return.  300 East is a True gem in Dilworth, and I hope to be there for brunch sometime.  Either way, I can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu.  I really wanted to try the crab cake, and the wife was so tempted to try the asian tuna burger!",

The only reasons I can't give it a fifth star, such limited seating ( but also part of why we like it) and the noise level upstairs can be overwhelming on a busy night. Reservations are the way to go here for dinner.",

I made two visits recently, once for a dinner date with my wife, and a few weeks later for a business lunch.  For dinner, I enjoyed a delicious plate of Bronzed Sesame Salmon, with a side of browned rice and sauteed spinach. My wife absolutely loved her order of Grilled Hanger Steak, and both dishes were paired with a wonderful Pinot Noir from the restaurant's extensive wine list. The bar also has a terrific selection of local craft beers and cocktails.  When I went back a couple of weeks later for lunch, I enjoyed a fantastic Chesapeake Crabcake Sandwich, with a side of Corn Salsa. 300 East boasts a wonderful atmosphere for either a romantic dinner or a casual business lunch, and the service is as good as the food. Parking is conveniently located in a surface lot behind the building, but can get tight at lunchtime.   I was thoroughly impressed on two visits here, and expect I'll be coming back more than a few times in the months ahead.",

Dessert was the purple sweet potato ice cream and it was different. Rich, creamy, slightly sweet and did taste like sweet potato. And we had the cheesecake which was delicious. Set worth going here. Only issue today  as the pasta. Next time it'll be the fresh fruit.",

I got a little sass from the host at the beginning when we came 10 minutes late and one our friends couldn't make the reservation but other than that, my group of 3 had a an amazing time here!   It's a nice homey feel when you enter but still bustling on a Thursday night! We came for restaurant week/queen's feast and boy did it impress! The waitress was super friendly and funny   we started off with a glass of wine and put in our orders. I got the goat cheese and my other friend got the pita bread. Def recommend the goat cheese plate so delicious and I made sure I cleaned out the plate.   I got the steak  and that was soo good! The steak was cooked to medium and not the best steak I've ever had but pretty darn good. What I will say is that the overall platter with the mashed potatoes and green beans were cooked to perfection making the plate overall 5 stars worthy!   The only thing that I thought was even better was the salmon! My friend got it and I tried a little bit and I thought it was legit a flavor explosion! It was a perfect blend with the sides and I never even knew you could ask to cook your salmon a certain way like a steak. 100% recommend and that def stole the show. My other friend got the chicken and it was still very good and he seemed to enjoy it!   For dessert, I got the tres leches cake which had such careful craftsmanship in making the dessert I was so impressed with the presentation. The monitor was perfect and it wasn't too sweet and was a great way to end the meal! My other friends got the pumpkin cheesecake. Super yummy as well but def something to be shared since it was pretty heavy. Our waitress was so funny giving us a hard time about not finishing our desserts. Rest assured, I volunteered as tribute and made sure none was wasted hahaha   Anywho, perfect place with amazon food and amazing service!  5/5 experience and would recommend to anyone especially during queens feast!   Ps parking on the side was pretty easy",

I chose the salad option, the Hanger steak, and the dessert, the chocolate brownie with vanilla gelato, and all were delicious! However, the salad reminded me of something you might get a wedding or event at a banquet hall- your standard, couple of tomatoes with greens, dressing in a metal little cup on the side. The steak was great though, their horseradish sauce and onion marmalade did not disappoint and it was cooked perfectly! Their brownie was also one of the best I've had at a restaurant, which was a huge plus! My only big issue was the service and timing of everything.   They were definitely understaffed, especially for restaurant week, but we sat there after ordering drinks for a good 10 minutes and by the time our cocktails came they were already getting ready to give us our wine and salad (wine was included in the restaurant week menu). They seemed to try and take our plates away too quickly, while we were just finishing up and it felt very hurried along for the lack of attention we were given by our waiter. (In college I worked in banquets and fine dining at a country club before being a server at various nice restaurants around town, so these little things, like waiting time and the lack of interaction by servers are what I notice the most at places.)All in all, I would love to come back and try their regular menu to see what the experience would be like!",

It was served warm with bread on the side and it was so flavorful and delicious. As an entree I got a braised lamb ragout that was hearty and tasty. Not a bad meal!",

    "text": "I really cringe at writing this review since I had higher expectations for today's brunch. I saw a picture of the breakfast pizza in Charlotte Agenda's newest brunch article and was totally intrigued.  We got there around 11am and had an hour wait which is pretty good IMO. Probably after a little over an hour, we went to ask and they were able to sit us outside but I wish they would called our name earlier if that was available.   We ordered the beignets and pimento cheese as apps. The beignets were too dense for my taste (very cake like) but I liked the jam. The pimento was fantastic and had very good flavor. That was the good part.  I got the breakfast pizza, the gf got the eggs benedict and her nephew got the kids \"grass-fed\" hamburger. If you are going to put grass fed on a kids menu, I sort of expect to see a nicer hamburger come out. I cook grass fed beef all the time and just hoped to see better regardless of the designation or not. The first one was cold and tiny -- like half the bun. We had to ask for a new one and the next one was warmer but not much better looking. My gf liked her benedict but her breakfast potatoes were cold. Now, my pizza was edible as I was also pretty hungry but it was pretty lackluster. It just lacked flavor and was lukewarm with halfway melted cheese.  I read some of the older reviews before coming about the service and I thought our server was pretty decent besides clearing our table from our excess mimosa glasses. I just thought the food could've been a lot better and that's usually my criteria for returning. Based on other reviews, I'm definitely tempted to return and give it another shot at least for dinner but time will tell.",

The restaurant is in an old Victorian house that has been converted, the ambiance is really nice.   Recently I visited 300 East for Queens Feast, this was my first time visiting for dinner. The service was great - our waiter was very quick and conversational. We enjoyed the recommendations he gave and his upbeat personality.  The food was good, I ordered the half chicken with pan gravy. The meat was moist with a yummy skin. The side of green beans were cooked well with a bite to them in a butter sauce. I also really loved the baked goat cheese appetizer - bread was warm and fresh, the portion was large and shareable. For dessert I had the peach cheesecake, it wasn't nearly as peachy as I had hoped - but overall, a tasty cheesecake.   I'm not sure I would do dinner again without the restaurant deal, it wasn't anything mind-blowing, but it was good. An enjoyable night.",

On some level 300 East connects with our soul and we methodically return like loons heading back to northern waters in Spring.  Intimate.  Attentive.  Relaxed.  Cozy.  Predictable.  Unpretentious.  We find the food fresh and seasonal, prepared and presented well, and reasonably priced, which adds to its draw.  While not every visit is perfect, the errors are minor scoring from us a 5-star performance for 25 years.  Hell, most places have folded their tent by now.  For it's understated simplicity and culinary excellence, 300 East is at the top of my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter.  Enjoy!",

The have indoor and outdoor seating. My party sat inside. It was a nice level of noise. The food was good and I enjoyed everything I had. I started with the hummus appetizer and had the Mediterranean salad for my entree. My boyfriend ordered the Pimento cheese appetizer and that was very good!  This is a great casual spot if you are looking to have a low key dinner but don't want it to feel like eating at a sandwich shop. I will for sure be back. Also there is a parking lot behind the building. Very useful in that area of town where parking is sometimes complicated and hard to find.",

Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives filmed an episode here, which put it on my radar out in CA.    I had the Almond and Cornbread crusted Trout.  This was absolutely the best Trout I've ever had.  It was served with a sweet potato wheat berry hash- like dish.  All of it, delicious.  I hope they put it on the menu because it was a special tonight and I would want to eat that again.  My husband had the bacon wrapped Gorgonzola filet.  He couldn't believe how good it was and how well it was cooked.   We had to get dessert.  I went with the ice cream sandwich.  Molasses cookies with butterscotch ice cream.  I was full but I managed to finish the whole thing.  My husband had Callebaut Chocolate Brownie.  He did say it was a really good brownie.    The meal from start to finish was not disappointing at all.  Our server was great and friendly.  I have to go back!",

If the weather is nice they have patio seating outside that faces east blvd for all those who want to bring their dog. The service is always great here. On our most recent visit we had the grits bowl and the springer mountain chicken sandwich. The grits bowl could be a bit larger but I didn't leave hungry. If you are very hungry consider ordering an additional side with it or some of the beignets. The chicken sandwich was very good- I believe it had an apple chutney on it and it was delicious. The side of the day was a grits casserole and it was awesome- wish they would make this an option every brunch.  300 East is Definitely a must try for your next weekend brunch!",

I read the reviews and they seem pretty good, and we had a complete different experience. We got there and waited an hour to be seated. We finally got a table outside and were excited to have food since the reviews seemed great. Our server was nice but service was really slow. We ordered the beignets and the pimento cheese to start and that came out quick. The beignets were too hard for my taste. Normally they should be fluffy and soft, these were more dense and hard. The pimento cheese was I think my favorite part of the meal. My recommendation is that they change the saltine crackers to some crostini's or some toasted bread. After the appetizers,  we waited 40 minutes for our entree to come. I ordered the Benedicts with potatoes, my boyfriend ordered the breakfast pizza and my nephew had a kids burger. Honestly nothing was good. We came because Charlotte agenda posted a picture of the breakfast pizza that looked amazing and what we got was a complete different thing. It didn't look appealing at all. My potatoes and Benedicts were cold, but we had been waiting so long that honestly I just a little and was not hungry anymore. My nephews burger was ice cold and we had to send that back because it was unbearable. Honestly, won't be coming here anytime soon. Was pretty disappointed.",

I could see parking being a doozie here, so best if you could carpool with friends or Uber/Lyft here.   We tried them out during restaurant week.  They were super busy but we had reservations and were seated within 5-10 minutes of arriving. We were sat in one of the two booths that I could see downstairs, Intended for one person on each side. Quarters felt a little tight and a little claustrophobic at times near our table.   I loved that the clientele was eclectic, all ages and everyone was super friendly.    The bar /waiting area for those without a reservation seemed very small and seemed to overflow to the dining area.  Service was wonderful and I felt as though our food came out super fast, even though they were busy!  The Queens Feast came with a choice of wine, appetizer, entree and a dessert for $35.   For my appetizer: I had their signature hummus with pita wedges and veggies.  Loved that it came with a lemon wedge to add flavor to hummus to your liking.  Very good and I felt it was a large portion.    My entree: I had the Grilled Hanger Steak, cooked medium, which came with Onion Marmalade and horse reddish.  Asked for the onions and horseradish on the side, steak was served along with mashed potatoes and the best tasting green beans! I was so glad that I got my steak toppings on the side.  My steak had the best flavoring just be itself.  It was very juicy.  Again, serving size for the meal was plentiful and I took about half of it home.    Dessert: I ordered the Callebaut Brownie, which has  honey pretzel crumbs and salted caramel on top of the brownie served with the best vanilla gelato!  I would most definitely get the exact same food selections during my next visit!   I order the Spanish Pizza and their Famous Onion Soup to-go for the Beau.  He said it was probably one of the best onion soups that he'd ever had. He devoured the pizza and soup, loving every single bite of his dinner!",

My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week and were blown away by the goat cheese appetizer (along with the rest of our meal).   Knowing how much I enjoyed the food the first time, my boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday. The food was (again) outstanding. We got the goat cheese appetizer to start again... so delicious. For dinner, I normally don't order steak, but I decided to be adventurous and ordered the Grilled Gorgonzola-Stuffed Filet Mignon. It was one of the best meals I've ever had.. my boyfriend got the same thing and said it was the best steak he's ever had. And for dessert they brought out a complementary brownie because it was my birthday. What a wonderful birthday dinner.  I can't wait to come back!",

The place was super packed but we had a reservation so we we were able to walk right in (even though we were 6 minutes late). The restraunt was very warm and inviting.   We were seated upstairs in a cozy little corner over looking downstairs. Our waiter told us the baked marinated Vermont goat cheese was amazing so we started with that! OH MY GOODNESS......ONE OF THE BEST GOAT CHEESE APPETIZERS I'VE EVER HAD. I also tried the apple cidar mimosa. It was pretty tasty but know that there is no OJ in it. When I tasted it, I told my husband I think they forgot the OJ. He smiled and said no, its apple cidar and champagne lmbo! Oops, I knew that.  For brunch I chose the wafflewich. It was one of their specials for the day and sounded tasty. It was a ham and cheese sandwich cut into triangles with a waffle like print smothered in some sauce that will make you want to slap your mama and then topped with a fried egg with crispy kale on the side. Well, I think it was kale. None the less, the meal was amazing!  Can't wait to go back!",

I was 12 mins late for my reservation instead of 10 and I guess that was a big deal. My old time favorites here are the Ahi tuna salad, crab cakes Benedict with the potato cake of course ( only served for Sunday brunch) , BLT shrimp panini, the tuna burger and the sweet potato ravioli appetizer. I wish they had better bloody Mary's for Sunday brunch but they make up for it by having an amazing 1/2 bottles of vino on Sundays.",

    "text": "This is definitely one of my favorite date spots in Charlotte if you do not want to spend a million dollars and still get exceptional food in a romantic, but not stuffy atmosphere.   300 East is kind of hidden on East Boulevard in what used to be a house and has a quaint, romantic vibe. The tables are lit with candles and the booths are old wood and might not be the most comfortable but that makes the experience more unique. There are not a huge amount of tables in this restaurant because it literally is the size of a house but I've never had to wait long for a table. They do accept reservations, though, which I would suggest if you have a large party for a special occasion.   I have dined here on several dates and for one of my birthday dinners with girlfriends, which was really nice as well. The atmosphere is laid back as no one seems to be in a hurry and folks usually order a cocktail or a glass of wine with their meal. The service is friendly and prompt. Each server I have had has always been very helpful in suggesting wines or deserts. There is a patio on the front of the house, where i have only sat once, but it seems to be pretty full on the nights that I walk in. There are only 2 restrooms in the restaurant, so if you drink too much water or a few beers and need to use the facilities, chances are you will have to wait in line outside of these one person restrooms. Unfortunately, these are right by the small bar downstairs, so sometimes it is a little awkward to have to stand very close to tables and bar patrons while doing the Pee-Pee dance. BUT if you don't use the restrooms here, I suggest you take a peek in that direction anyway because there is something that seems a little out of place here.. The typical \"Women's and \"Men's\" signs are replaced by wood pieces in the shape of dogs. There is only one difference in between the two doggy signs. I will let you decide on what you think that may be...   OK, enough potty talk.. for the good stuff. The food! I will admit, I have only had 2 different entrees here because my favorite is hard to stray from. It is... drum roll please... the Applewood Smoked Bacon-Wrapped Gorgonzola-Stuffed Filet. BAM! Who's hungry now?! I absolutely adore it! It has to be their most popular menu item at dinner, if I had to guess. I have also ordered the Black Bean and Chile Chicken Tortila and that was also very delicious! A little smaller of a portion and extremely inexpensive. My favorite appetizer here was probably the Baked Goat Cheese with Sun Dried Tomatoes as I am a big fan of goat cheese.   The food is so affordable here also. Entrees range in price from about $10 - $22, with the filet I mentioned being the most expensive (but worth it!).   I highly recommend 300 East for a 1st date or a special occasion with close friends and family. Try other menu items if you must, but I don't think you will be unhappy with the Gorgonzola filet!",

Located in a house on East Blvd, parking can be a bit tight on busy weekend evenings, but if you go during the week there should not be a problem. It's very comfy-cozy on the inside with dim lights and interesting decor. Quite a few tables on two floors inside and a small space outside for nice Charlotte nights.   On my most recent visit I had the fall salad with chicken, which was  delicious. Goat cheese, port-cherries, and a pancetta dressing made those greens shine. Other menu options include southern cooking with some healthier options thrown in. And the service here tends to be good without being too overbearing. Definitely somewhere to stop by if only to try out the delicious pumpkin cheesecake in the fall. It is divine.",

    "text": "300 East is a very cute restaurant in a house tucked in Dilworth. The lady and I came here this past weekend (my first time!) for date night.  Appertizers: Baked French Onion Soup. Loved it. Lots of cheese and a good amount of onions and croutons. The lady kept stealing my spoon to get some more for herself!   Entrees: I ordered the Bistro Salad and the lady ordered the Filet Mignon with Gorgonzola Cheese. Hey, I'm confident in my masculinity and sometimes I just want a salad! Anyway, the salad was texturally interesting -- beets, pears, apricots, bacon -- the actual flavor was just alright. I enjoyed it, but don't think I will be making a repeat order. The filet was so-so, and cooked more of a medium than the medium rare we requested. Some whipped butter was awkwardly served on top. I know this isn't a steakhouse, but if you're going to serve steak there still needs to be some presentation!  We split one of the Matilda Wongs ($11) -- very tasty! Be forewarned, its a sneaky drink. It goes down easy like any fruit drink, but this beverage has at least 3 liquors blended in.   In short, I would have no problem coming again -- and updating my review -- but I think next time I might be sampling a few of their small plates (apps, soup, sandwiches, etc.) rather than entrees.   Tip: The place started getting rather loud towards peak dinner time, I'd recommend coming earlier.",

It tooke us over 2 and a half hours for dinner for 6 people (We had apps but no dessert). It was slow, our waitress was absent, and it took them forever to clear our plates.  Food: awful. Three of us got burgers and they were flavorless and over-cooked. My sister in law got the pork tenderloin and it came out cold. The crab cakes were eh. The salmon nothing special.  The few pluses: good local draft beers. Good coffee. That's it.  In a city with plenty of good restaurants, don't waste your time on 300 East",

Matilda Wong is a girl you don't want to ignore. French onion soup is cheesy yum. Shrimp with goat cheese ravioli was a bit lemony, so if you're into that, you'll love it. The butterscotch ice cream sandwich (made w molasses cookies) was just happiness. That's right, I went all out. Was by myself, ate at the bar and felt safe. Highly recommend this place if you're in town.",

    "text": "Did not love this place but I can see why people do. It is quaint and comfortable. We did not have a res and they got us in super quick anyway. I had the crab cakes benedict, one was crab cake the other was potato pancake. I could be mistaken but I don't think the menu made that distinction. On the plus side, I liked the potato cake better. The crab cake was very fishy, dry and lacked flavor or flair although full of crab to their credit. The coffee was excellent. My husband had the shrimp and grits, it was a wonderful choice. Generous and succulent. Not a deal breaker but no side plates for your coffee spoon, only could put it on the bare table and the waitress was gone for long periods, letting empty creamer trash to pile up on our very small table.",

    "text": "As I perused the menu at the bar of 300 East, I noticed who I assumed to be the chef sitting nearby doing paperwork. I saw an intriguing selection on the menu: Farro Saute which was a mixture of farro, wild mushrooms, butternut squash and kale. Not caring for mushrooms (yeah, I know.....) I turned to the woman and asked if she thought the chef would consider substituting something for the mushrooms. She understood my humor and asked how I liked roasted beets. I said absolutely! So she was very willing to please. The beets were a very nice substitution even though the entire dish was pink! Didn't mind a-tall.   In addition to the farro saute, I ordered a cup of her split pea soup (almost as good as mine) -  so good I enjoyed it all the way home and had it finished before I hit the driveway.  Either I'm really blind or TV at the bar dim and hard to see.   I definitely recommend 300 East. In fact, I have a group visiting this week.",

Originally the table for our reservation was up on the second floor, which looked nice a cozy but we had an octogenarian with us and those stairs were steep. They were quick to pull together a few tables on the lower level and reseat us, no problem!  I had a hangar steak with horseradish sauce which was tasty for sure, but the winner for the dish was the potato cakes. They had just enough spice to make them really interesting. There is a good local beer selection on tap, so don't think you will have to compromise on your drink. The portions were generous but not grotesque and the server was sweet and quirky. I look forward to going back and trying out more of their fare as well as the neat looking glassed in patio they have.",

I mentioned that the eggs were overcooked when our waiter finally stumbled back out to bring the check, and he gave me a dismissive sorry. Thanks, bro. I also find it ridiculous that they charge $2.75 for a glass of orange juice that is half filled with ice.  Cheap.",

Was not complicated, coke no ice, ginger ale, water and a diet coke. He repeats ginger ale no ice, two cokes and water. We correct him, he repeats it wrong again (write it down for God's sake).   Next, my wife orders the wedge salad .. As she likes iceberg salad. What comes out, is not a wedge salad .. She returns it. The rest of our order was two hamburgers medium, steak sandwich and the crab cake sandwich.  The hamburgers came out well done, the steak sandwich was far from tender and over cooked and the crab cake was horrible .. dried out and stale tasting.   Will not return.",

Probably the first time I liked a spicy mango salsa on top of my food. And I was pleasantly surprised at how well they cooked the coconut rice! Next time I would opt to skip the $3 special starter (pasta with mushrooms) only because it was nothing special and the entree was big enough to fill me up.  The salmon was basted with what tasted like a sweet teriyaki glaze. Also good, but tasted very homemade, and I would try other items on the menu before returning to this one.  The brownie is gooey on the inside and topped with ice cream. I also liked the blackberry apricot cobbler which really tasted like peaches and cherries? Maybe I'm hallucinating, but in any case, both desserts were good and plates were licked clean in record time.  Minus one star because....I was not a fan of the complimentary bread, and the hummus was just decent. The main thing that bothered me was the noise level; I blame it on the half off wine special and the plethora of women who filled this place up, but the venue is fairly small and two stories and I had to yell to talk and lean over the table to hear anyone. Extra half star for the server being willing to split the bill to the exact penny!  Tip: Accepts AMEX. Make reservations and sit al fresco!",

They retrofitted an old home with a cross between traditional and contemporary.  The personnel is friendly and inviting.  And that's where it stops.  EVERYONE was waiting for a long time to get their food.  Our party--a basic two-top--waited 30 minutes for our appetizer, which I declined once it was brought to the table.  After about 45 minutes of waiting, our dinner came.  I got the farro saute.  The ingredients were fresh enough, I guess.  But my Kale was undercooked, and the 6 shrimp that were included were way way overcooked.  I added the crab cake, which saved the dish.  But the base dish was $19, + $10 for the crab cake, + $3 for extra Kale.  That's a $31 dish that wasn't even cooked well and was way overpriced for the type of ingredients used.  Unfortunately, I will not be back.",

The sweet potato ravioli appetizer was amazing and I'm going to daydream about it often.  I had the half chicken and my husband the gorgonzola stuffed filet. Both entrees were great.  The dessert we had was a dark chocolate cake/peanut butter mousse heaven and was a special that night.  The service and atmosphere were also great - we can't wait to go back!",

Which can be difficult when you're on the verge of a food coma and you've got a deadline looming.  300 East is a charming restaurant. I tend to order the Baked Marinated Goat Cheese appetizer and the Fall Salad with Chicken.  The baked goat cheese is heaven and comes with warm french bread.  The Fall Salad is full of port-soaked cherries, goat cheese, and pine nuts. (Yes, I love goat cheese).  The service is warm and friendly and it can get really busy during the lunch rush which also means parking can get a bit tough.  If you can do lunch bit early - say 11:30ish - you're golden.   You can also have lunch on the front patio on particularly nice days and take in the charm of the Dilworth neighborhood.",

If it was butterscotch the molasses cookie overwhelmed the butterscotch flavor.  The carmelized pineapple is tasty & would've have loved to have more.  It was literally not enough for a bite for 1 person.  it was a peanut M&M sized portion so splitting it w/another person was a trick.",

We had the chips and guacamole for an appetizer, sesame salmon with steamed spinach over rice & crab cakes with mashed potatoes and French green beans as entrees, and bread pudding for desert. Everything was excellent! The price was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of food! I was very happy! And to top it all off, we had the best waiter! I can't remember his name, but he was friendly, attentive, and very quick - which is saying a lot considering he had the entire upstairs to himself! Well done 300 East... Well done!

Theta bartender was great, we told her what happened she bought us a round of bloodys and said they were short staffed as the patio was open that day due to the warm weather.

We started eating and 25 min later she showed up with the third entree, two of us had furnished eating, and he ended up eating alone.

Outside on the cozy patio under the trees with cool lighting, or sit inside in the house converted to restaurant. We decided to sit inside because I wanted to experience the ambiance of the restaurant.  We were seated upstairs at a 2 top table tucked away in a corner. The seating is limited inside so the place stays full but it doesn't feel crowded. It took our waitress a little time to get to us at first, but when she finally got to us she said she just finished washing a rum and coke off of her shirt. We gave her a second chance due to the drink spill and she was great for the rest of the visit. She even touched on one of my pet peeves by taking our entire order without writing anything down but she didn't miss a single thing.  I'm not sure if it was the Matilda Wong talking (small pitcher of mixed drink), but I had the best falafel of my life here. I had to leave off the tzatziki sauce because it contains dairy and the falafel was still so flavorful! The texture was great, not too dry and I have no idea what kind of seasoning they used but it was amazing. Add some lettuce, tomato, onion, and carrot salad to top it off. Perfection. Hubby had the streetcar veggie burger (minus pepperjack) and it was also very good.  Thank you 300 East, we will be back to see you soon!",

    "text": "Maybe it's because we went on Easter, but our brunch experience was less than stellar. The restaurant itself was pretty cute -- definitely homey and clean. Having reservations for 10am (when they open on Sundays), we walked in with a crowd of people and were seated right away at a table upstairs. We asked the waiter a couple of questions about the menu and he directed our attention to the special Easter brunch items. There was a bread basket available with scones and muffins. Since I wasn't going to eat the whole basket by myself ($9 worth of pastries), I asked if it was possible to switch out a scone for the bagel that was included with my scrambled eggs meal. He said no. So I ordered my meal anyway: scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and a bagel. The eggs were HORRIBLE. Not sure how a chef messes up scrambled eggs but the texture of these was way off. In fact, I could barely force myself to eat them. They tasted like they had been sitting in a big vat in the kitchen for hours and the chef simply scooped them onto my plate. Maybe they were worried that they wouldn't get the food out fast enough with an Easter rush so they pre-made everything? Or maybe they were made from eggs that come in a carton? I don't know, but I've never had scrambled eggs like that. The bacon was limp - close to being under-cooked. The potatoes were room temperature at best. My dad had ordered Eggs Benedict, which also came with potatoes, and he mentioned to the waiter that his weren't very warm, so the waiter brought out a new dish of potatoes and they were still cold! My husband ordered the special captain crunch french toast. He said it was good, but probably wouldn't order it again.   Overall, the food was a big disappointment. But even worse, on the way home, we all agreed that we hadn't felt very welcome in the restaurant. The staff wasn't very friendly and the servers weren't very accommodating. Wishing we had a better Easter brunch.",

The first time I ate here I had the gorgonzola-stuffed filet mignon, which was wrapped in bacon. Wow. It was delicious. The only problem is that no other entree there could ever compare. Still, the black bean and jerked chicken tortilla is really good (and half the price of the filet mignon).  I'd suggest trying 300 East for lunch. It's a cheaper way to check out the restaurant. I recommend the pimento cheese filet burger or crabcake salad.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what's more cozy here, the charming old house this place is set in or the French Onion soup.  Do you like French Onion? Well, make sure you get it when you come here. I order it every time. It's like a giant hug in a crock. I imagine this is what it would feel like to cuddle with that bear from the Snuggle commercial.  300 East is two levels and has a nice patio. Menu-wise, I've pretty much loved everything I've had here. App-wise you can't go wrong with the Sweet Potato Ravioli or the Baked Marinated Vermont Goat Cheese. And yes it deserves to be mentioned again, the French Onion. My goal is for this review to get French Onion trending on social media. I love the Sopressata pizza. A warning: it is spicy. And delicious. Grilled Gorgonzola-Stuffed Filet Mignon is great. If you order the crab cake, please note that is singular. My friend Ski was disappointed during our latest adventure here last night. Specials are always pretty good. I went with the corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's Day last night. It came with homemade soda bread, butter and cheese. Holy. It was all absolutely fantastic.   I have yet to order dessert here in the almost 11 years I've lived in Charlotte. Why? Well, I'm usually stuffed. I do know that Guy Fieri shot Diners, Drive Ins and Dives here last week and he had the Butterscotch Ice Cream Sandwich. If it's good enough for Guy, it's good enough for me. I am definitely getting it my next trip.   If you enjoy a great cocktail, you have to get the Matilda Wong. It's like a boozy punch type concoction that comes in a small pitcher. It's a must get if you feel like enjoying a drink.   300 East also does brunch on Sundays. I usually go with French Onion and Matilda Wongs, so don't ask me about the rest of that menu. I'm hoping to have enough will power one Sunday to be a grown up and order the Crabcake Benedict.  Service can be slow at times. I'm not really sure why. However, everyone who works here is super nice. Not sure what to order? Ask them.",

Table for one please...no make that table for two because Matilda Wong will be joining me for lunch. Feeling self-conscious about drinking a 32oz cocktail with a single straw? Don't worry, the person sitting next to you has one too!  Sat in a really cool rustic pew with a great view of the dining room with hanging origami. My waitress was excellent.  The seared Ahi Tuna on my Salad was coated in toasted sesame seeds and cooked perfectly, nestled in mixed greens. Complements of won ton skins, avocado and a rice cake made for a very pretty presentation. There were three dressings, sesame vinaigrette for the salad, sinus clearing wasabi and a Shoyu Reduction. Over all it was very light and refreshing dish.  Unfortunately, this was my third lunch on a Charlotte Yelp tour and I didn't have room for dessert. The desserts really do sound amazing. Some really creative ingredients! Next time you will be mine Butterscotch ice cream sandwich!!",

They offer seating downstairs, upstairs and on the patio. Most recently, I went for Sunday brunch. I made a reservation on Open Table and was able to be seated outside. We ordered some cocktails after the 12 deadline; $6 bloody's and mimosas. I went with the breakfast pizza, which is actually a full pizza with two fried eggs on top. It comes with ample cheese, tomatoes, chorizo and some green onions. It was good, but not my favorite. We also ordered the beignets ($6) to start. How can you go wrong with fried dough and sugar? It came with a delicious fruity honey topping as well. They were soft and melted in your mouth. My friends went with the quiche of the day, and a regular pizza from the menu. Service was good. Love the variety on the menu and hope to try some more brunch options soon!",

The hummus is pretty good but the best part of the dish was the warm crispy pita bread. I could seriously eat these as my meal. For dinner, I had the farro dish with grilled shrimp. I expected the  kale in the dish to be cooked as the rest of the dish was warm so that was a little surprising. My boyfriend had a pasta with calamari special dish that he enjoyed.

I've driven passed this restaurant countless times as it is right down the street from my dentist office, but never thought that this hidden gem would be right under my nose!

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. After seeing the full menu, we decided to order items that were not on the restaurant week menu. I ordered the tuna burger with mashed potatoes and my husband ordered the seared tuna salad. We ordered the caprese flatbread as an appetizer and everything tasted AMAZING!!! The food was good to perfection and came out in a timely manner! I would recommend you give it a try! The bathrooms are clean and well-kept, but it's odd that there's nothing on the door to let you know that it's a bathroom. Just a dog on the door...nothing else. But anywho, it's a cute restaurant with good food, what's not to love!!",

It was pretty delicious and decently priced $23. The meat was a little cool and under seasoned but It was nothing  worth sending back. The crab cake was very good.  Service was nice and I highly recommend the Tilia Malbec !",

On my first outing to this beautiful restaurant, I ordered their fish tacos and shared bread pudding with my date. This was my first fish taco experience, and, because of it, I'm now a fan. The bread pudding was amazing, having the perfect soft but not mushy texture and sweet but not saccharine flavor. It was so good that I ordered it again on my second visit.  When I returned, I ordered the special, trout, which may have been the best fish I've had. It was almond crusted and served with a sweet butter sauce. My date ordered an Asian fusion salad with strips of seared tuna; I helped myself to a few bites of her dish and loved the subtle combination of oils and dressings used, the lightness of the tuna, and the freshness of the greens.",

I had one of the specials - grilled duck breast on a bed of baby spinach and goat cheese with roasted plums, beets, toasted walnuts and raspberry vinaigrette on the side.  Wines are half price on the bottle on Sunday night, so we skipped our usual Casal Garcia Vinho Verde (300 East is one of the few Charlotte restaurants to serve this excellent summer wine) and splurged on a 2009 Kunde Zinfandel.  We split a strawberry cobbler with goat cheese ice cream for desert.  The ambiance is private, with pleasant art work hanging everywhere and the bears hanging at the bar,  There is an emphasis on local produce, meats and  cheeses, and the selection of beers also emphasizes local craft brewers.  All in all, and establishment we would like to see our neighborhood continue to support.",

However, every single time he came to our table he always tried to up sell us. \"Can I get you guys some guacamole while you decide what you would like?\" or \"i could bring you guys some hummus while you wait on your food\" are not bad in of themselves, but after hear those kind of things several times me and my date started to feel a bit guilty. We felt a weird pressure like we were bad customers because we wanted to keep the meal under 50 bucks. Remember though, he was really nice fella but the aggressiveness of the need to raise our bill so he can get a bigger tips was a bit off putting.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for one of our very first dates and since then have come back to 300 East often for special occassions. We request the same booth each time, and have yet to have a bad experience... until last night.   We had dinner at 300 East yesterday evening to celebrate my birthday. After being seated, we ordered drinks and my boyfriend let our waiter, Michael, know it was my birthday as he was looking at my ID. The point here is that he knew it was a special occassion.  Our appetizer came and was great, however when our meal came my gorgonzola filet was so undercooked that it was actually unappetizing. We waited for Michael to return, however after about ten minutes finally had to walk up to the bar to flag down a waiter to send him over. He did not apologize for the steak coming out raw, but did take it back to the kitchen. Another ten minutes later he returned with my meal. The steak, which was the original one served to me, was now a mangled piece of unedible meat. Tough to cut or chew, and needless to say less than enjoyable. After a bite or two, I had lost my appetitie.   When he came back to our table, he asked if I was still working on my meal or if I'd like a box. I said no, and before I could even get out that the meal was not up to par and quite frankly inedible, he had walked away with the dish, again with no apology.  Sadly, we were still charged the $23 for the meal which was the most frustrating part. It's one thing to be served a horrible meal, but another to feel as though the restaurant/waiter does nothing to make it right either by returning with a meal that is as ordered, or after a second attempt removing the item from the bill.. or really even just a simple apology and some sensitivity to the fact that we were here for a special occassion, of which he was fully aware.   Needless to say, the message was received from 300 East that they do not want our business, so we will no longer return to 300 East for our special occassions.",

    "text": "This is the food I want as my final meal when I'm sentenced to death or have hours to live on my deathbed... someone better bring me 300 EAST to ease my final moments!   I literally dream about eating here. When my boyfriend and I have dinner at 300, he taunts me for sitting across from him with my mouth open, eyes glazed in the middle of a food-gasm.  The prices are way too expensive, but they're totally worth it... This just means I'm only capable of visiting every few months because of the $$$.  The service is good. Most of the time our servers are attentive and friendly, but recently we ending up waiting for over an hour for our entrees... something to do with the ticket printer?  Now let's talk about the good stuff:  -Baked Marinated Goat Cheese: Holy moly this appetizer is amazing! Rich goat cheese with whole cloves of garlic and sun-dried tomatoes.  This dish totally melts in your mouth. I recommend substituting the crusty bread for soft pita. Mmmmm.  -Sweet Potato Ravioli: I DIE!! They only give you 4 pieces, but this stuff is so rich I'm not sure you could eat more than that. The Gorgonzola cream is what makes this dish, if the restaurant wasn't so classy I might pick up the plate and lick it clean.   -Fall Salad: BEST SALAD IN MY LIFE! Hands down. Greens are super fresh, port-wine soaked cherries are the bomb, yummy pine nuts, and goat cheese a plenty.  I substitute the pancetta dressing for balsamic.  PROS: heavenly food, fresh ingredients, diverse menu selection, vegetarian friendly  CONS: too expensive, limited parking, limited seating",

I love their focus on fresh, local produce. Everything just tastes very fresh and good.   I've brought several out-of-towners here - for the food as well as for the atmosphere of the restaurant. As noted by several other reviewers, 300 East is located inside of a converted house. I think it really gives a feel for the Dilworth neighborhood.  Service has always been really great here. Depending on the weekend, you might need to make reservations, but if you can get in before 11am for brunch, you'll generally be ok just walking in.",

I ordered 300 East's rendition of a kale salad as my main entree. When it showed up to the table, I was confused to see a handful of kale with dressing (on one side of the plate) and a handful of burnt kale (on the other side). It was incredibly small and I was surprised that the waitress had not warned me. The menu said that the 'burnt kale' was supposed to be kale chips, but trust me when I say that this was the farthest thing from a kale chip. I've eaten kale chips plenty of times and this would be better described as a salt block. To put it bluntly, inedible.   I asked for portobello mushrooms on top of my salad and got what appeared to be a 1/4 of a portobello. I jokingly asked my date if it was a salad for ants. Given the price point for this dish, I expected quite a bit more. I was left incredibly hungry after my meal and left 300 East for a second dinner elsewhere.   Two days later, I am still a bit bitter.",

Honestly the only reason why I wanted to come here was because I was curious about the Matilda Wong.. it was even better than I imagined.. seriously drop what you're doing & get. it. NOW  We started off with the Sweet Potato Ravioli with the Gorgonzola Cream sauce. Four pieces of delicious ravioli, but I didn't really care for the creamy sauce- it was a little too rich & salty for my taste. LOVED the ravioli itself though. It was topped with walnuts & served with some bread.   For entrees, BF got the Hanger Steak & I tried the Muffuletta Pizza without meat. BF liked the steak, but my pizza, while it looked good, was so damn salty! Must be because of the olive spread but jeez.. Nothing that another Matilda Wong couldn't remedy though :)  We split a dessert, but I don't remember what it was.. it had been a few months since we ate here. Guess that means it wasn't horrible, but also wasn't memorable :(  I would come here again & try a different entree.. perhaps the Farro Saute? I found the prices to be pretty reasonable: $12 for ravioli, $12 for the pizza, & I think around $20 for the steak, probably under $10 for the dessert .. & $11 for each mini pitcher of the Wong.. hell yeah",

The banisters have a plastic barrier so you can see down to the first floor.  Our waiter was very nice, informative, and dressed very classy.   We started with a the goat cheese. It was so very delicious. I had the crab cakes with mashed potatoes and the daily veggies of squash, zucchini, and onions. My friend had the bacon wrapped filet with the same sides.  Everything was so flavorful and wonderful! Even though I had only a tiny bit left I couldn't leave it behind. Even the leftovers the next day were just as good.   I will most definitely be returning soon. I can't wait to try more items on the menu!",

I came with a date for Charlotte Restaurant Week, and had the sweet potato gnocchi, the hummus, and the brioche bread pudding.  The gnocchi was good, but it was swimming in sauce, which made it unhealthy and a bit too salty.  Hummus was great, however, and the bread pudding was fantastic  It's in a more affluent part of town but it's completely casual and I've always enjoyed my trips here.",

The food is good, menu quite creative, Fit for Foodies. The drinks are creative also. My only complaint is that the martini or manhattan that I usually order \"up\" comes with ice shards floating in it, which waters down the drink.  Parking is easy and close.",

It wasn't until I moved to Charlotte last year that I unexpectedly re-discovered it until driving down East Blvd. a few months back.  My first visit I had the man baby pizza and a salad (can't remember the name) and remember leaving quite impressed.  This go around, for dinner. The server advised they were debuting the spring menu that night. The fried goat cheese appetizer came with a large toasted baguette and was splendid. The few sips of onion soup I had were very impressive as well. The guacamole was nothing special and the only plate I wouldn't order again. Just simply not flavorful enough.  For the entree, I got the gnocchi with bacon and leeks in a creamy thyme sauce. Holy moly. One of the best gnocchis I have ever had (and I studied Italian cooking in Italy). The bf ordered the bacon wrapped filet which came stuffed with Gorgonzola. Admittedly, I much preferred mine. The Gorgonzola was too rich against the filet, in my opinion, but he seemed to be happy.  After scrolling through other yelpers pictures, I can't wait to try this place for brunch. Nutella and Banana stuffed French Toast... Wowee! Definitely a must try of you're in the Dilworth area.",

My fiance and I came to check out this place for brunch and of course, were met with a long waiting time for a table.  Luckily after waiting about 10 minutes, we snagged two seats at the bar in perfect view of the Sunday football game.  There was really no question as to what I was going to order once I saw the breakfast pizza (think chorizo, lots of cheese, queso fresco, and eggs), and my fiance ordered a grits bowl with various toppings.  Food came out relatively quickly for how busy the restaurant was and I was so happy with how freakin huge (and delicious) my pizza was.  The chorizo was by far the star of the pizza, and there was enough food for 2 meals worth.  The grits bowl was also very solid, but a bit smaller in proportion.  Price was typical: $11-17 for brunch plates. Bartender/server was very friendly and helpful! The restaurant itself is unique in that it's in a house. Overall, cool place in Charlotte worth checking out, especially if you're as passionate about pizza as I am.",

I had the Tomato and Red Pepper soup with goat cheese and it was to die for...really flavorful and delicious. We also got the hummus appetizer which is made in house and I think that's something anyone would love. Really well done.   Entree I was between the fish tacos and hangar steak sandwich and went with the steak option on recommendation. Flavor was good but I didn't feel so great after eating it, which is the reason for the 4 star vs 5. It could have been because I eat red meat very infrequently but I'm not sure.   Our waitress did a great job, informative and friendly and also was attentive and I think the atmosphere is very cool. Want to go back and try the drink they are so famous for and check out some different options on the menu. Overall really pleased.",

The Spanish Flatbread was bland and the Usual sandwich was left under the broiler a little long which burnt the bread. Our other two entrees were equaling uninspiring.

My fiance made a reservation for my birthday and we were promptly seated. I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It's a cozy, old house turned restaurant and it's so warm and inviting. We had excellent service with a twist of Halloween humor. My fiance ordered the grits bowl. If you like grits, you'll LOVE the grits bowl. You get to add 4 toppings. I took a bite of his grits with chorizo, salsa, cheese, and a fried egg and it was a burst of good flavors all in one bite.  Another thing I love about 300 East is the freshness of the locally-sourced food. I feel good about eating here and I know I'm getting a high quality meal. I definitely recommend 300 East.",

I started with the french onion soup, and was it worth it. The soup came served in a small kettle bowl with cheese oozing over the edges, a good sign right?? Ha Ha! The broth was so flavorful with just the right amount of sauteed onions. For my entree I ordered the roasted chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day. The chicken was perfectly cooked with crisp skin and moist fall off the bone meat. The mashed potatoes and gravy were good, but the veggies, sauteed squash and zucchini were disappointing. No real flavor. Overall the atmosphere is nice with a unique menu that I think everyone could find something to enjoy. I definitely look forward to going back...I can imagine that soup will be great on a cool fall day!",

I ordered the Roasted Joyce Farms Half Chicken, Gravy, Mashed Potatoes, and Green beans. My wife had the Grilled Gorgonzola Stuffed Filet Mignon Bacon Wrapped, Mashed Potatoes, and Green Beans. The food was well cooked. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it took close to an hour to get our food and the other reason was an employee left open a door to outside that allowed the cool winter night air into the building. Also there is only one door and it was not easy to get out because of people waiting for tables. Otherwise I would coming to this restaurant. The ambience is suited for a cozy candlelit romantic setting. The ambiance was great for a romantic setting.",

The bar was pretty much open so we decided to sit here. We also grabbed a couple of Bloody Marys.. loved the kick, seems like a good hangover cure. The dessert came out quick, and it was pretty big. The ice cream itself wasn't overly sweet. The cookie, similar to a large, soft ginger snap, was delicious and covered with granulated sugar. I'd ease up on the sugar topping.. but it was very tasty all in all.   I definitely want to stop by for dinner, the crab cakes sound to die for. You can get 2 for about 11 bucks as an appetizer or add one on to your meal for $10..YUM. Cheers!",

Working in the high end restaurant scene ourselves, we try and be extremely understanding when it comes to service, but this was excessively underwhelming in that department.  Not only was the service extremely slow, it took over 10 minutes to be greeted, or get fresh coffee, our server was also dismissive and unpleasant. She also never checked back on our benedict's after they took over 30 minutes after we finished our beignets to come out.  On one Benedict the eggs were extremely underdone, and on the other they were poached hard.  We were so hungry after the wait, and didn't see our server for 15 minutes so we weren't able to point this out. Overall the beignets and cheesecake made up for the mishaps with the benedict's, as the were both incredible, but the experience was lacking overall due to the lack of service.",

Our reservations were for  12:30 and the place was packed, as in most tables were occupied on all levels, but there was no line. So I'd imagine a walk in may not have a long wait. There is parking in the back , disregard the signs as they are misleading. I asked the hostess and she ensured me it was fine parking in the back even though the signs states otherwise. I ordered the grit bowl with various toppings  and an order of French toast w/ bacon. Both were okay but nothing spectacular. Also the bacon was not cooked enough for my taste, so that was left on the plate. Overall it was just okay . I don't think This place will be at the top of my list to return to. A solid 3 stars with an extra star for having a parking lot and easy street parking.",

We'd heard about this place a lot since moving to Charlotte so we were excited to finally try it. The space is really cute in a house on East, with a downstairs and upstairs seating area. We got a comfortable booth upstairs. Our server was friendly and attentive, but not too much so. We both started with a glass of wine that came with the menu. It was good, not great, but for a free glass, better than expected. We started with the hummus and the goat cheese. Both were generous portions despite being a special menu. The hummus was good, and the pita bread was tasty as well. We enjoyed the goat cheese but it wasn't as rave-worthy as we've heard it is. It was a little plain in flavor, and almost tasted more like cream cheese than goat cheese. We both had the steak for our entree and it was great. They were both cooked just right and were very tender. The sauce on top was rich and added a nice flavor. The mashed potatoes were creamy and well seasoned, and the green beans were cooked nicely. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the brownie. I'll say the desserts really were the star of the meal, they were amazing. The bread pudding was so flavorful and indulgent, as was the super fudgey brownie. I loved the pretzels on the brownie, it added the perfect crunchy/saltyness to it. We really enjoyed ourselves here. It's simple, definitely a great place to come in if you want a good meal that feels home cooked. I'd say it's a solid 4-star dining experience.",

For the meal I ordered the Shrimp BLT with a jalapeno potato cake. For me, the sandwich was just okay. It was a bit greasy and I don't think with the other options that are available I'd order it again. But the jalapeno potato cake was really good. It was just the right amount of heat and flavor.

Our waitress Kate was phenomenal! She was so fun and helpful with the menu. (We had a ton of questions) We had the sweet potato ravioli as an appetizer ( we dug in before I could get a picture) My sister had the salmon and I had the hangar steak. So freaking good.  I think my only regret is not trying the onion soup (but it's 90 degrees outside soooo......) The prices were way better than I would've expected. We will definitely be back. The food, the atmosphere, the service and the prices makes this my new favorite restaurant!",

We got in and we're immediately seated and the waitress came to our table quickly.  We ordered a bottled of tasty wine.  I asked the friendly waitress what she recommended for appetizers, dinner, and dessert.  She strongly suggested the goat cheese with Nova bread.  UMMMM AAAAAMMMAAZINNNGGGG. We devoured it in 5 Minutes.  My husband got the st Patrick's day corned beef special and I went with the waitress' recommendation of the seared tuna salad.  I wasn't really sure what to get and I was indifferent about getting a salad for dinner.  Let me tell you.... it was delicious!  The corned beef special was good as well.  For dessert we got the brownie and it was really good.  We will definitely be back!",

It's only five minutes from downtown (\"uptown\") attractions like the Mint and Bechtler museums in the Dilworth section of Charlotte's historic South End. It is in a vintage home that has been converted into a small, charming ambiance. Patrons can dine outside, downstairs, or upstairs. What 300 East offers is an eclectic menu of new American cuisine. These somewhat unusual options are creatively prepared and simply delicious. We arrived Sunday evening about 530 pm and were seated upstairs. Shaine was our friendly and professional server. We learned that bottles of wine are 50% off on Sunday, so certainly took advantage of that with a bottle of Italian Pinot Grigio. We started with Crab Cake appetizer ($12.50) which was mostly crab with very little breading. Yummy. For entrees, we had a Cod special ($18) and NC Broiled Shrimp ($20). Both were delectable. Everything was quite fresh, nicely seasoned, and perfectly cooked.  Although we were rather full, we managed to share a scrumptious piece of cheesecake for a great ending to a delightful dining experience. We are just visiting Charlotte for a few days. If you are a local reading this, you are fortunate to have a gem like 300 East in your town. Go!",

However, the bar had seating available, so we picked that rather than wait 45 minutes for a table. The bar had full menu service, so that worked. The food was excellent, drinks good a good desert menu, service was friendly and responsive. I think this would be a great place for a date night meal. Overall, very enjoyable experience.",

We are new to Charlotte and a few months ago saw the restaurant on the TV show Diners Drive ins and Dives- I knew that it would be on our list of restaurants in the area to try first and it did not disappoint! In fact I always do pros & cons when I dine at a place for the first time and couldn't find any cons. We dined on Valentines Day dinner so there was a prefix menu @ $50 per person Our starters :Roasted Shrimp & Fritters. Entrees: Scallops & Ribeye.  Desserts: Donuts & Cake Everything that passed our lips was on point and we both agreed less than half way through the meal that we would be back by months end. We also ordered cocktails with our meal an I must say that the bar is on point we ordered Margaritas and I'm always impressed when establishments choose to make their own mixers instead of opting for the pre made syrupy mixers. Kudos to 300 East it was wonderful",

Unfortunately the location is also very trendy/popular and on this date there was a 1 hour wait. The bar was open seating, but it was full and this left the patio. The patio is normally not an issue, but in 94 degree direct sun it was not the most comfortable. The food service was not as timely as it could have been. The server needed more assistance than he had. The actual food was filling, but could have been better. The bacon should have been crisped and the breakfast potatoes featured burnt onions? This wasn't a horrible experience but due to the service and actual food I only awarded 2 stars.",

I live nearby and I love supporting neighborhood restaurants. The food was good--it wasn't great. The service was NOT good and this is the reason we haven't been back here in years. There are so many places in Charlotte where the food and service are both very good; so it doesn't give you a lot a reasons to choose 300 East. My husband ordered the crab cakes---they were fine. I ordered the grass fed burger. It was fine/good---not memorable. And that's my point. With so many really good choices in Charlotte, a restaurant needs to be memorable for us to come back. It'll probably be years before we come back here again---if we ever do?",

The meal took foreverrrrrr to come out, like over an hour, and by that point my kids were hungry and getting restless and started not having ideal behavior.  Everyone there had kids and no one cared or even looked at us.  It was Mother's Day.  To specify, my daughter was pouting and my son was crying and saying he was hungry.  The newborn was sleeping.  Someone who I presume was a manager came up to us and told us that he got a complaint about one of the kids being loud and could we quiet him down.  I asked why the food was taking so long and if we had food they would be eating and we had been there for 75 minutes.  He went to the back and brought all our food out, which was not warm.  I'd guess it was siting there at least 30 minutes.  He ruined my morning, the food was terrible, and I would not go back.  Upon telling this story to a few people at an event later that day, I was informed that one family had a similar experience and another family saw cockroaches on their bar area.",

I then took my food out to the car and as I was pulling out of the parking lot, the bartender who I picked my food up from stormed out to the parking lot holding my check, staring me down, and shaking her head in disgust. I rolled the window to ask what her problem was and she just stormed back inside continuing to shake her head. Other customers were outside witnessing this as well. Over a $5 tip on a $45 pick up order?!? I was so confused and embarrassed. Here's one more tip: never do that again.",

I made a reservation for Saturday on Yelp and we were seated promptly upon our arrival, being lead upstairs to the cute little dining space. At a private-ish table for two, we sat along the wall and were greeted by a very friendly server. I had a (non-alco) Peach Fizz, served to me in a wine glass, while my boyfriend had a red wine.   We started with the falafel app- super good with great flavors accompanying it. I was torn between the pork, the filet and the crab cake, yet somehow decided on the farro saute- our server suggested I add salmon to it, so I also added a crab cake side- available for $9 to add to any entree! I adore farro and vegetarian entrees so the salmon + crab combo was a perfect addition to this dish.  I really love the ambiance of 300 East- food was solid and the cozy atmosphere was even better. It would be great to come back for brunch or on a sunny day- I hear they put tables out front when it's warm!",

They won't seat you unless 95% of your party is there. This place has no more than a 3 person waiting area capacity so... hmm... It wasn't crowded and we got a cozy table upstairs. Server was nice, greeted us and went over the menu and beverage options. Didn't take us to figure out what we wanted but took the server a while to get back to us to take our order. That's where it kinda started sucking for me. I ordered their Signature Hummus appetizer which was completely OKAY, nothing signature/special about it. For my main meal I went with their Bronzed Sesame Salmon. The description is: coconut brown Basmati rice, sauteed spinach. The rice was overdone and dry and honestly there wasn't anything coconut about it. Salmon was again, completely OKAY. It was if they slathered teriyaki sauce and sprinkled sesame seeds over it like an Ah hah! moment. Sauteed spinach was, you guessed it, sauteed. The best part was getting the desert but that took FOREVER and we had to find our waiter to let him know were ready for it. By this time over an hour had passed. Everyone at the table was already itching and starving between the courses. I went with the White Chocolate Brioche Pudding. Everyone who had ordered it pretty agreed it was delicious. By the time we got the check and paid for our meals, we had been there for almost 2 hours. Pretty ridiculous considering it really wasn't all that crowded in the first place. I don't know, maybe we just picked a bad night because I really want to believe this place is as great as everyone has been telling me.",

Charlotte is really \"chain hell\" when it comes to restaurants to its nice to feel like you are walking into to someone's house for dinner. The second floor really is like sitting in someone's living room. Every time I have been, the place gets packed out and they keep coming back so make a reservation before hand.   P.S.

It's really cool that they have very revealing windows that really show off the inside of the establishment -  oh 300 East, how you teased me when I looked at you while driving past.  So Sunday finally came and we stopped by for brunch! One of us ordered the Breakfast Pizza, which was definitely more than one person could finish (well.... I could have finished it by myself...). Another person ordered the Brioche French Toast to satisfy her sweet tooth, which definitely did the job as well.  Personally, I can't ever say no to crabcakes, Hollandaise sauce, or anything \"Benedict-y,\" which was perfect because I ordered the Crabcake Benedict, which came with a side of asparagus and includes 1 crabcake and 1 small potato pancake. I really enjoyed it!",

    "text": "My friend and I decided on a weekend trip to Charlotte to eat, shop, and catch up. Charlotte is ~ half way between our two cities. We did our research and came up with some good places to eat. 300 East was on our list for Sunday brunch before we both headed home.   The Good: The bartender was fantastic! I don't remember his name but he was very friendly and provided impeccable service despite being VERY busy on a Sunday morning. There was also a female bartender who came in about 20 minutes after we had been seated and she was also super friendly and helpful. I had the Shakshuka special, my friend had the french toast, and we split some beignets. I can't speak for her but the shakshuka and beignets were both delicious. I'm used to having shakshuka with crusty bread - they served it here with a sort of fried bread which was a little odd but delicious nonetheless. I would give this place 5 stars based on the service at the bar and the food alone.   The Bad: This is where the three star rating comes in. We came in around 10:15 on a Sunday morning - right after they opened. The restaurant was pretty empty at this point - every seat at the bar was open. I walked in and the hostess looked me up and down in a not-so-friendly way. No smile. Just a look and a hello. I said there would be two of us and she said 'do you have reservations?' I said no and she (in a very snooty manner) said 'You can sit at the bar or you can sit outside. That's all I have to offer you. We also have heaters outside if you want to be comfortable'. I worked in restaurants for years - as a hostess and as a waitress. I get that if the restaurant is booked w/ reservations there's little you can do for people who walk in. It wasn't the issue that we couldn't sit at a table. We were perfectly content at the bar. However, her attitude was such a turn off. If we had more time and weren't somewhat in a hurry to get back on the road, we would have turned around and not eaten here. That would have been a shame because we would have missed such wonderful food. But, in all honesty, you need better people at the hostess station to welcome people. I will say that I didn't interact with the other two people who were seating patrons so maybe they were friendlier. But, goodness, the one hostess genuinely almost ruined what was otherwise a great experience.",

Had the baked goat cheese appetizer.  Very delicious, comes out sizzling!  Served with bread that was crusty and looked like it had butter baked into it.  I had the special which was a spinach salad with Opah, which is a white flaky fish.  It was so good and the vinaigrette it was served with had an Asian flavor.  All delicious.  My friend had a burger which he raved about.  It was a pretty good sized burger too.  1/2 prices bottles of wine, so got a Talia Malbec, which was very good.  Wine list was pretty substantial.  Service was perfect...not pushy or rushed.  Wish I got her name, but she had really, curly blonde hair.  Great experience, will be back for more!",

We considered a second order but our food came, and we were happy we had room for the delicious main course.   For brunch I got the huevos rancheros. Instead of having the tortilla on the bottom with the filling on top, it was served nacho style with slighted toasted tortilla triangles filled with seasoned ground beef, with guac, beans and veggies to dip.

Started with a local brew OMB (Olde Mecklenburg Brewery) \"Copper\" Amber Ale nice color and a light caramel taste with a slight nutty ending.  Also tried the OMB Capt. Jack is a very light Pilsner good to drink at the beach.  The menu has a good number of options which did not make fair on me, so I asked the bartender for her suggestions.    CrabCake Eggs Benedict with a citrus hollandaise on a potatoe pancake and asparagus on the side.  Everything tasted fresh and delivered on what a brunch dish represents.  I decided I wanted something sweet to come full circle the selections were all intriguing but Chocolate won...their brownie is the perfect size and served warm with vanilla ice cream.",

The decor is comforting and home-like which makes sense because the restaurant is located inside a former home.   Our appetizer was the spicy pimento cheese. The cheese itself was tasty, but I wish it was served with something with a little more \"oompf\" and uniqueness. Instead, it was served with a few premium white crackers and a few sticks of carrots and celery.   But I loved my entree. I ordered the roasted NC shrimp served over a bed of goat cheese ravioli and mushrooms. The lemon sauce was perfect. One of the most unique flavor combinations I've had in recent memory and I practically licked the plate.  My boyfriend got the gorgonzola stuffed filet and his mom got the crabcake. They both loved their choices.   Based on the reviews I've read, it seems like this restaurant's forte is its brunch. I'd love to come back and try it.",

Dinner is pretty good, but not as inventive and sometimes the meals are not cooked in a way which makes the food stand out. I had a steak overcooked once. Brunch on the other hand OH MY GOD. Amazing. One of the best places in Charlotte. It's hard to try new things as the 5 items I am used to are my absolute favorites. *** it's difficult to parse out sometimes because it is inherently easier to be delicious as a brunch place. But I'm telling you the brunch is amazing.  -The old house that the restaurant is housed in is cozy, but very nicely done.  -Service has always been great.",

    "text": "Great Queen's Feast Deal! Included the first glass if wine which about 95% of restaurants do not do for Queens Feast. I had the baked goat cheese app and it was incredible and the baguette it came with was huge, could have made a meal out of just that. My friend had the hummus which came with a generous helping if pita bread but beware it has capers on top so if you're not a fan ask them to skip it. She had the sweet potato ravioli, one of their signature dishes and it was amazing! I had the Sesame salmon which was cooked to absolute perfection and the coconut brown basmati rice was delightful as well. I ended up bringing half of that home along with having them box my entire desert, orange and black sesame cheesecake (yummm)! I just couldn't stop with the goat cheese appetizer, it's a must. I also had the signature cocktail, the Matilda Wong, which comes in a 32oz pitcher, on special on Weds for $7.50, it was tasty (sweet) and a great deal. My friend had a specialty peach cocktail from their drink menu and she said it was fabulous also. Our server Tommy was attentive and adorable! We sat upstairs and it was lovely. Great ambiance and easy to hear, perfect for a relaxing visit. The regular menu looks fantastic, I will definitely be back!",

The reason we go? 1/2 off wine on Wednesdays (Tuesday's is Nolen)  The wait staff is average, expectations are met completely, but not really exceeded.   The food is good, typical new American cuisine, but not amazing. I will say that i've never had a dish I didn't like...but that is balanced by saying that i've never had a dish that blew me away.  I think this would be a great place to take a date, looks expensive, and has great atmosphere but it won't put a dent in your wallet.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a recent Saturday evening dinner here and really enjoyed the meal and ambience.  Good vibe in here, casual in a decidedly upscale way.  Food-wise, we enjoyed grilled shrimp risotto cakes as an appetizer, and followed with the gorgonzola stuffed filet mignon for me (way tasty, very rich) and a seafood special of the day (salmon, bacon, hollandaise) for her - also way tasty, and very rich.  So... not a calorie counter's meal unless you're trying to see how high you can count.  No matter, the first standard we apply is \"could I have cooked this just as easily at home?\" and the answer was \"no way\".  Bombay martini, up, olive, very dry - solid work at the bar.  Wine.. ehh, this may be the weak spot.  Not to be too big of list, and so-so selections it seemed.  We did have a bottle that was pretty good and she had a glass that was not so much, but - and here's where I sound like an effete snob and I swear I don't even play one on tv - I have grown tired of drinking red wine served \"hot\" or warm room temperature and paying for it.  Get a chiller and handle up on it at Cellar temperature - or at least on some \"choice\" selections if intend to be even remotely serious about wine.  Will return.",

    "text": "We've eaten before here with friends for brunch and the food was fantastic. Expect a long line for brunch on weekends; it's totally worth it.   I am only giving 2 stars because we just ate here for dinner after trying it for brunch several months ago. The experience was like that of a completely different restaurant. Sadly, there's probably a reason why dinner reservations were so much easier to get and why there was so much seating left over. We had an extremely pushy waiter that literally asked us repeatedly if we wanted add-ons for drinks, apps, salad, entree, and thankfully not for dessert.  You would think that after we said straight up \"no, thanks\" after the first time he'd get the message. Then he would come back a few minutes later and ask the exact same thing again. He really pushed the expensive entrees and had nothing good to say about some of the lesser priced entrees. We tried one of the priciest specials at his recommendation (lobster + crap pot-pie), and it wasn't very good. We also had a burger which was decent. Overall, I felt like I was being sold to way too hard and I felt all he cared about was getting as fat a check as possible for biggest tip. I still tipped him the standard 15% but this really killed our experience.",

    "text": "I had wanted to go to 300 East for a few months now and after my meal there I was left underwhelmed.    Atmosphere - The restaurant is located in an old home that is dimly lit on the inside.  I give it props for atmosphere as this set my expectations high.  Food - The menu is kind of quirky, with lots of unusual combinations.  Like Erin said, not the place to go for a normal burger.  I was not looking to be challenged this night so I guess that is why I got pizza in a non-pizza establishment.  Anyway, we ordered the chicken & shrimp satay for an appetizer.  It came out on two wooded skewers connected together with the final piece of chicken on a chicken, shrimp, and chicken rotation.  This made separating the food difficult for sharing.  The chicken was okay but tasted like it was from frozen.  The accompanying blob of rice was dry and tasted as though it had sat for a while or was not completely cooked.  My main dish, the Pizza Classico, had a nice crust but was drowning in oil and grease.  This may have come from the cheese, fried capers, sauteed onions, or just the addition of olive oil to the pie.  Overall, too much grease.     Service - Service was okay.  The waiter was attentive but I think the food brought me down.  Overall - A nice place, decent service and so-so food makes for a miss.  Food is why I go to a restaurant, so even though the other factors were spot on I will be skipping 300 East in the future.",

And, compared to typical restaurant prices that I'm used to (in Atlanta), I was happy to see that the good food was priced well.  This is the kind of place that I'd bring my parents: nice, but not really pricey, and good atmosphere.  Most of the dishes are between $15-$20.  I had the filet, which was stuffed with gorgonzola.  Cooked slightly uneven, but overall, really good.  My boyfriend got the Moroccan-spiced pork tenderloin, which he  enjoyed.  He also got a cannolini soup that had pancetta in it that was really good.  Overall, a nice dinner.  I'd definitely come back.",

The mood always seems to be lively there. They also have this amazing drink called the Matilda Wong, or as most call it \"the Wong\". They only allow you two so that should tell you just how strong it is. There service usually seems to be dead on, and they always know there menu quite well. I usually end up getting my favorite the Sonoma Salad with Chicken. If you like wine, they always have a special on Wednesday night where its half off a bottle of wine. I also definitely recommend making reservations if your going on a Friday or Saturday evening as they tend to get busy.",

She handled us with care all evening, and was a very informative server. We started out with the marinated goat cheese and  roasted garlic appetizer. It was delicious and paired with a Sebastiani Cabernet---Bellisimo! We then ordered three dishes for the table. The Hanger Steak served on a Potato cake, the Black Bean and Lime Chicken Tortilla, and the Warm Farro Salad with Roasted Squash. The Hanger Steak was a good size portion cooked exactly as ordered and quite tasty-the potato cake was soggy..needed to be crisped up. The Black Bean And Chicken Tortilla was just \"okay\" --- could have easily made it at home with three ingredients. But The Warm Farro Salad with Roasted Butternut Squash and Baby Kale and Winter greens and Toasted Pumpkins Seeds was over the moon----so good we moaned while eating it! Alas the Espresso machine is broken..so regular coffee and a Prune Spice Cake with Homemade Buttermilk Ice Cream was our ending. The cake and ice cream were delicious. I would  be traveling back to that darling little house again...the Farro salad is calling my name!!",
