    "text": "I'll do a little Q&A with myself.  1) What's good about it? Location is right next to a good dive-ish bar.  A place for food in Uptown without having to hit Epicenter.  Lots of TVs to watch sports.  Wings for the most part have been good if you like the Hooters style wing.  2) What's not so good about it?  Customer service is attrocious.  End of story.  3) Care to elaborate?  Sure!  Overall it's just pretty clear that most of the staff there is not properly trained.  Even though my restaurant experience is limited I've been enough different places to see how well trained staff operate and most (not all) of the staff the 5 or so times I've been exhibited some behaviour that just made you want to scratch your head?  4) Can you give examples? Of course!  How unfair it would be for me not to give examples. - The waitresses at the bar have fallen under the category of either not attentive or unfriendly.  Most recent time waitress was very friendly but getting her attention was like trying to get an audience with the Pope.  I asked for a drink (just a soda), she forgot and then I had to track her down five minutes later. - Example of unfriendliness.  One time I go in to order wings.  About 12 minutes (I didn't have a stopwatch but I think I waited a reasonable amount of time) I inquired nicely about the status of my wings.  The main reason I asked was the waitress seemed rather flaky and I wanted to make sure she got my order in.  She goes on the defensive (as other waitresses have) just for asking this question and proceeds to explain how the wings take time.  If customer is politely asking Customer Service 101 suggests offering a simple \"They'll be up on a few minutes\". - The male manager when I've observed more or less stand in one place scoping out the bar rather than actually moving around and seeing if they actually help staff.  5)  If service is so bad, how come you kept going back? For the reasons mentioned in #1 and the fact that ultimately I did get my food and drink and nothing was wrong with it.  But my last experience was so bad I can't see myself going back anytime sooner.  6) I've noticed you're a guy.  How do I know you're not some angry pathetic loser who is just upset because the Hooters gals weren't given you the attention you were looking for?  Believe  that if it makes you happy but end of the day whether it's an attractive young lady or someone that looks like my grandpa I still want good service.  In fact I've never really cared for the overly phony flirty service that Hooters waitresses engage in.  I like that any waiter/waitress that strikes a nice balance between genuine nice person and \"Yes I work for tips\".  But this case there was maybe one person I encountered who could strike that balance.  7) So what would you suggest?  If you're looking to drink and watch sports you have plenty of other options in the area.  For wings if you look around Yelp you can also find a number of quality options.  And if you need to see some eye candy while you eat wings and drink beer there are plenty of internet sites you can enjoy in the comfort of your own home while eating wings and drinking much cheaper beer.  But avoid this place like you should avoid making fried pickles the lone vegetable in your diet.",

    "text": "typically enjoying the food at hooters and the service not being too terrible me and my friend decided to come here on a monday night to watch the playoff game. upon arriving the hostess who I'm going to assume is new was very confused as to what table to put us at. she handed us the menus at the front door and then we followed her, not a big deal, but I've never known a restaurant to have customers carry their things to a table. she takes us to a table but as we begin to sit down she tells us we can't sit there. why? no clue. finally we get to a table towards the back of the restaurant which is fine. once seated it took our server 12 minutes to get to our table to greet us so at this point we give her our drink and food order- 2 beers, 1 order of boneless wings, 1 order of wings,side of fries, and a water. 23 minutes later she brings the water and then tells me they are out of the beer i ordered so i told her to just bring me whatever ipa was on draft, still NO beer for my friend. 7 more minutes pass and then we both finally get our beer. at this point it has no been 30 minutes so one would expect our foo to be out soon. was it? no. an hour and 7 minutes later another waitress brings our food out, fries are mising, and our current server has not been back by at all so i wrote our next order of wings down on a napkin and gave it to the runner to just give to the server. 13 minutes later our server comes by to let us know she out our next order in, and we let her know we are still missing our fries and my friend would like another beer.  24 minutes later our second order of wings comes out but do our fries? nope. so i tell the runner yet again were missing our fries. 5 minutes later we finally have those.  server then comes back to tell us the beer is coming out as foam, after watching them trying to pour it the keg had just kicked, i would've told them but she never came back. while there was a game going on, the restaurant was only half full, & very understaffed. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years including being a corporate trainer and i have never in my life experienced something as bad at this. There was no teamwork between the staff, no communication between management and guests, no help from management to staff as well. if you're staff cannot handle the rush you are having then go on a False wait, pick up tables, help the bartender make drinks, something. not just stand at the kitchen window yelling hot food when you could be running it. while i do feel some type of sympathy for the staff because you could tell they were overwhelmed many things could have been done about it. this is not the first time I've had an issue at this store and until something changes i will not be back and i will let my friends know about what happened.",

    "text": "If you could look up \"Doing It Wrong\" in the dictionary there would be a picture of the Uptown Hooters next to it.  A group of 9 of us (8 guys and me) went for a friend's birthday because they had ordered the UFC fight. The fact that even with the fight the place was half empty on a Saturday night should have said something, but we set in and ordered up food anD beers. Since we were a large group we were given two waitresses but they didn't coordinate so items we ordered kept not being entered. After the initial round of food all we were ordering was beer but even with an average order to table time of over 20 minutes we were still missing some pints (this may be because one of the waitresses said she was too young to serve beer so she had to relay the orders to a bartender who then forgot them).  You would think that after paying around a grand to be able to show the fight they would actually do so, and you would be wrong. They forgot to put it on until we reminded them and a few times switched the channel to King of Queens. When it was on, it was so low you couldn't hear, which was odd since it was the only thing our entire section was watching. Apparently the manager was the only one who could change it back and if I were him, after hearing one of the waitresses whine out my name at the top of her lungs every 5 minutes, I wouldn't be on my A game either. I feel sorry for you, David.  My bar for the food was low since it's Hooters (the breasts and thighs they specialize in aren't on a chicken). But even though I was drinking water, not beer, all night I still got sick later that night. Bar: not met.  So, bad service, lack of beer, poor fight showing, and questionable food. Yeah, I won't be going back.",

I give two starts instead of one because there are some great waitresses there. I'm not sure if it's the cooks or the manager, but something is horribly wrong. Myself and 4 friends went here after a hornets game(probably getting in at 9:30pm). Expecting the place to be packed, only the right side of the restaurant seemed to be occupied with the left being empty. We ordered our food: two all you can eat wings with fries, buffalo shrimp, six piece wings and a turkey burger. After waiting 30 min for our food, our waitress tells us they are out of turkey patties. My friend and his girlfriend decided they had enough and left. It took another 5 min for our food to come out and the two all you can eat wings were slightly cold and did not have fries. It took another 5 min for one set of fries to come out and the second set never came. We ended up complaining to the manager who blamed \"everyone from the Hornets game coming here\" but we put our food order in waaaay before it got busy. It was Monday night football and a Laker/Hornets game. It should've been staffed better.",

A couple of things I would say about the new item is that it was not as filling as I would have like for the $9.99 price.  It was good but def. left me hungry for more.  The bread was a plus but just me longing for something else afterwards.  The bread was toasted perfectly and it was delicious but just not enough.  Overall I think the shrimp is a good addition to the menu and I'm glad to see Hooters is branching off from its normal wings and beer options.  Good job Hooters!",

The limit for 5 people is 35 as he states problem is we had 28 drinks and he still charged us for the shots we didn't ask and booted us. .

I can tell it was locally brewed as the voice of North Carolina's icon, James Taylor, started singing in my mind (The song \"You've got a friend\" in case you are wondering). Either that or I was completely drunk after drinking a pitcher of the beer with a friend and I started to think of James Taylor.  I highly recommend this place to get a few beers during one of those scorching hot North Carolina summer days.  Have fun y'all  :)",

Hooters happened to be around the corner from where I was staying so I decided to give it a shot. I could not have made a better decision. The establishment was in pristine condition. I love the setup including the 360 bar. But above all, the most impressive thing about the experience was our server, Dep. The place was busy so things were backed up at the bar and kitchen. She was constantly paying attention to us and getting things to us as soon as possible. She could not have been more friendly and patient while also being pulled in so many directions due to how busy the restaurant was. As usual the food delivered (always go Daytona) but Dep really made the experience worthy of a 5 star review.",

Also, their system sucks on who got what... could be the lack of experience from the server. We were so hungry. The server was nice but could have come by more often. I had salad and asked for dressing on the side. I sat there without dressing for 40 min until she finally stopped by again. I didn't get my dressing until everyone else got their food because of the lack of followup.  I don't know if it's just Charlotte but all the food service I had this weekend was horrible.

Tonight I ended up at this location with my youngest teenage daughter after our mother/daughter night at The Knight Theater.  Because I mealprep I had my meal already in the car before we made it to the stage show. In route to Hooters I tried to scarf it down but had a little left (I don't do fried food) so I carried my little container inside with me in my purse and asked for a corner booth so I could discretely eat my food while continuing to enjoy my daughter company while she indulge in her fried food frenzy. Our server Dep was extremely nice and attentive. She took my daughter order promptly and checked on us and even made small talk. The manager on staff on the other hand was so stalkerish. He kept walking pass our table trying to see what I had (I do understand worrying about someone maybe with a weapon or suspicious item, so I pulled my container out so he could see it and not mark me as a suspicious character). He immediately called Dep into a corner to stifle her about me having food as oppose to coming by and speaking to me as Dep wasn't aware I only had a spoonful left.  NOTE: There was two other people in the restaurant who were seated way away. I understand bringing in outside food which could influence others so my starrage isn't because \" i can't \" bring in food, it's more so because of the way the manager handled it, I would've appreciated it if he would've come over to speak to me instead of stifling an employee in front of the customer without even addressing that situation. Reminds me of the episode of Undercover Boss at Hooters.  Anywho I don't really like fried food but I will eat it if it look and smell good and I'm having a OFF day. Dep is a 5 star server.",

I had myself a cheeseburger-and it was better than I had expected! The Curley fries were good too! I was a little more adventurous with my beverage-I had the berry Long Island iced tea. I felt rather girlie as it was pinkish purple in color and I'm usually a beer girl, but it tasted great! Kelley the bartender was pleasant too.

I think Hooters in general is way overpriced, but this particular location is in a perfect spot in Uptown. The layout of the restaurant and bar has a good, open feel to it. The service is hit or miss, but that's not unusual for a lot of places in Uptown.  The one thing that really bothers me is how they have the smoking setup outside. Having smokers at the door really ruins the restaurant's curb appeal. Also, we were sitting well inside on my last visit, but the smell of smoke coming in the restaurant from just three smokers in front was overwhelming. Why can't they have smokers outside the back of the restaurant like Tilt (which is next door) does?",

A few other friends stopped at a bar so we decided to go to Hooters, which just happened to be right next to the bar. We were seated quickly and got our drinks. Even made a joke with our server about her name not being what her name tag said it was. We ordered our food and everything went downhill after we got it. One friend ordered 8 boneless wings. She received 6. I ordered the nachos and requested that the pico and jalapenos be on the side. Well, they were... but there was also pico and jalapenos on the nachos! I finally asked the hostess (didn't see our server for a while after our food came out) for an extra plate, even telling her that I didn't want certain things on my nachos but they had put them on anyway. As I was picking off unwanted food and putting it on the empty plate, our server finally comes by and asks if she can take the plate out of my way. I said no I'm putting all the stuff on it that I ordered not to be on my food. Her reply: oh you're good! Then, as we're eating, a few of the employees decide to have a water fight?? Right beside our table. As the bill came, my friend, who took a pic of her wings for proof, said yeah you charged me for 8 wings but I actually only received 6. The manager proceeds to change her bill to incorrectly reflect that she ordered a special that was only about 20 cents less. After again addressing this incorrect bill, the manager finally fixed it to the point that it was almost fair and accurate. Just an all around bad experience and we won't be stopping here again.",

    "text": "First of all let me just say that I will never go to Hooters in Uptown Charlotte, NC again. I typically go to the Concord, NC location, but due to my location that day I just dined here. It happend to be National Chicken Wing day and they had BOGO on wings so it worked out. Anyway, I ordered 10 Smoked Wings, 5 Jerk and 5 Texas BBQ and 10 boneless wings (which were less than tepid). Now the last 16 times I had Smoked Wings in Concord, the Smoked Wings are served in the dry rub (unless otherwise specified). Well I got my wings and the Texas BBQ ones had sauce on them. I didn't fuss because my dining partner didn't want me to make a big deal about it although I never ordered sauced wings. So I'm eating the wings only to feel something stringy in my mouth. I immediately stop chewing to extract what was a long black synthetic hair. For those who don't know, synthetic hair is NOT real ... Synthetic hair is the CHEAPEST kind of hair that you can use for weaves. Synthetic hair is also made to look like human hair constructed from thin manufactured hair fibers. Strangely enough there was no shortage of synthetic hair in this establishment. I advised my waitress of the issue in a most calm and collect manner and even showed her the hair as proof of the incident. She stated she would have some more made. I'm thinking now that despite the hair, at least I can get the dry rub. I then get the second order and to my surprise...the Texas BBQ wings are sauced AGAIN. At this point I'm completely over this place and just eat so I can leave. I get my check and I thought just maybe my Smoked wings would be comped for the free hair appetizer. Again to my surprise...they were not nor was I offered a complimentary dessert, apology from the manager, etc. I got nothing but a long black strand of imitation hair and a check. I paid my check without causing any trouble and went about my day. I presume this is just normal activity here and happens all the time. Being that I don't really have a palette for hair, I'll think I'll stay away from this Hooters going forward. However, to any out there who have strange addictions and love orally consuming hair....THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU!",

The problem occurred when we asked for a refund on the Apple Crown shots we ordered but received a regular Crown shot. There is now way to tell the difference in a shot until after taken. So we brought the issue up to our waitress which then required the manager, Chad, to get involved. Instead of doing the correct thing, and refund or make the drink order right, he argued that he was being lenient and allowing us to have the drink when we should have been cutoff. Their rule is a 7 drink limit per person. Upon doing the math of, 5 drinks total per pitcher, one drink total for and individual beer, and one drink total per shot we came up with a total of 28. The allowed total for a group of 5 would be 35 leaving 7 drinks in the bank. Moral of the story is that if they mess your order up, they are going to try and make it look like the customer is wrong. No one has time for that. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!! Don't worry I took pictures of the bill to prove the point.",

    "text": "Hooters is a difficult restaurant to describe without mentioning the state of the entire franchise. The concept of serving cold beer and tasty wings by young women has been successfully copied by several \"breastarant-type\" chains. Hooters was one of the first, if not THE first to use the formula. Rumor has it that the idea started by some guys sitting in a bar in Clearwater, Florida. Well anyways, you know that Hooters are marketed to guys that like sports, wings, beer and attractive women.  That being said, you would think that now more than ever, Hooters would have improved on their operation just to meet the competition. We live near West Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale. Either of these two locations used to (note: past tense) set the gold standard for service, food and real fun. Fifteen years ago, you could go to just about any Hooters in Florida and enjoy some great food and drinks while being entertained by some ridiculously attractive and engaging waitresses. You WANTED to go back! That atmosphere has sharply declined, and it's hard to say exactly why.  During my recent trip to Charlotte, we visited a Hooters location before a basketball game. At first, I thought the atmosphere problem might be just a South Florida issue because we were greeted very enthusiastically the moment we walked in by several Hooters girls. With over two hours to kill before tip-off, we sat at the bar. And that's where the \"wheels fell off the wagon.\" A gratuitous smile followed by a sharp demand for ID's. That's OK, I am over 50, and my husband is over 60. I was not insulted, but honey...use a hint of politeness when speaking to a paying customer. The next thing I noticed is that the menus could stand some wiping down. The food is greasy, I understand that, but some 409 can cure that issue. To condense the experience, our salad and wings came out within a reasonable amount of time and were good. However, my husband's fries were not hot at all. He never said a word, but one of the bartender's noticed that he was not eating them and inquired about that. He said that they were not too good....kind of cold. Service 101...when something does not meet the customer's expectation, make it right on the spot, or take it off the bill. Doing neither is just poor judgement or training.  I think that this Hooters location is ideal in the downtown area of Charlotte. I would assume that they get a load of business from nearby hotels to really worry about business falling off. I can't get upset with the managers or servers because I have seen this exact type of deterioration at other Hooters locations in Florida. Yelp does not provide \"half star\" rating increments or I would have split my rating straight down the middle to a 2 1/2-stars instead of just two.",

We also ordered food - nachos with ground beef and 3 plates of wings. The nachos came but were with chicken and only 2 plates of wings. After we complained the 3rd plate showed up and they comped us some of the food off the check. The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the wings are great. Service overall though is dire. This is the 3rd time in a row service has been poor and the last time too......",

    "text": "This restaurant is absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional. I understand it is \"Hooters\" but it is a place of business and I have some extremely concerning issues to discuss. To begin: We waited on our wings for over an hour. The restaurant was not crowded in the slightest.   We had been there for over an hour, and had not been offered a drink refill and had two pitchers, empty, sitting on the edge of the table. I got my wings 10 minutes before the rest of our party, there were 5 of us total, and the rest of our table didn't receive their food for an additional 10-15 minutes.   I have worked in the food service industry on and off for many years and I know wings take 9 minutes tops. Sure there were people in the restaurant but it was not busy and not that difficult to fry wings and make a chicken finger sandwich. One of the patrons ordered boneless, unlimited wings and not only did the waitress get the order wrong (he got bone in) he ordered the second order as soon as the first one was dropped off and didn't receive them because it took so long and we left.   I asked to speak to a manager and they did the absolute bare minimum to remedy the situation. 50% off the incorrect order, no drinks comped, I am fully disappointed in the service.    I am going to further address the staff and inform the restaurant, and those reading the review that the waitress proceeded to come up to the table after I spoke to the manager and tried to not only argue with me but accused me of attacking her. I truly did not speak to her besides telling her that we needed to see a manager because our service was unacceptable.   This was completely inappropriate behavior, and if I remembered her name I would email the restaurant directly as I was truly offended. As many can see I am extremely reasonable when it comes to service and my reviews are unbiased.   All in all: our order was incorrect and it took over an hour. I had no issue with the waitress until I asked to speak to the manager and she then became confrontational.   My advice, unless you are willing to spend an hour waiting on food, run out of drinks and have the staff get in your face I would highly suggest finding a different place to eat uptown.

    "text": "Tonight wasn't our best experience here. We got seated, the woman then asked us 5-10 mins later what to drink. We order an appetizer. When she comes back we ask for the check because we just came for the fried pickles. She asked if she had forgotten our entrees. Then we explained that's all we wanted. The order was 6 dollars and some change so my boyfriend gave her a 20. She apparently just gave us the change back for the whole 20. He hadn't counted the money back yet so we were confused as to why when we came out of the bathroom she was like \"you didn't pay for your food?\" We put 4 dollars down for her tip. She seemed so rude about it when it wasn't our fault. Also, should probably tell the waitresses to stop counting all their tips in the front, it's rude and extra.",

She forgot 2 peoples orders. Waitress kalie. She didn't even apologize or show any type of urgency to correct her mistakes. As soon as we were sat we ordered drinks and shots which we didn't receive for almost 25 minutes. Again she only brought half of what we ordered. I will never go back to this location again. She's showed no care in the world for the mistakes and the time she wasted. Not to mentions before e were sat we waited outside for 1 hour. So we spent a total of 3 hours here and I didn't receive my food till 2 hours in since she forgot to put. Will s can you please message me",

Sat at the bar to watch the bowl games also sat with an empty glass for a good twelve minutes before it was refilled. Ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which I haven't had in years. Took 23 minutes for the food to arrive, it looks like only the manager was in the kitchen, didn't see a single cook other than him. Still if that's the case make it aware to the guest who haven't eaten all day. After the food eventually came out my chicken had not been cooked all the way and extremely raw in the middle. I asked to see the manager( who cooked it) he looked as if he had no sorrow and could have cared less. Been to many hooters and used to work for one and never had been so displeased with my visit I know this is not how they typically run something needs to be addressed because this place is a train wreck!!!!",

We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer but it never arrived. The wings we ordered were OK but not spectacular. The service was also average to below average. All in all customer service seemed to be below standards.   Hooters needs to do a lot of work to return to where they were in the late 80s 90s and early 2000's.",

I get a short miller. No problem. About 20 minutes later my sandwich comes out barely warm and the fries are super old. I explained the problem, and she said that it's grilled, that's why it was not super hot. I said, no it's a fried sandwich, of which she said, oh - I guess I just have a lot on my mind.  I ask them to try again and for a refill on the miller, but a tall one this time.   I watch her pull bud light, but the best part she topped it off with miller as if that'll fix the problem.   25 minutes later a half hot sauce covered chicken sandwich with again horribly old and cold fries comes out.   Worst attempt at a Hooters ever.",

My server pretty much ignored me up to the end.  She officially got herself awarded the second worst Hooters girl I have ever had serve me since 1986. To this location's credit, the manager did come by my table.  I explained what happened to him, and he was nice about it.  Even more so, the regional manager contacted me after an online review about them.  He did try to set things right. However, on my return visit, I had a similar experience.  The girl was a bit more attentive than the first.  However, the manager was sitting in the back talking with the girls and not taking care of the place overall.  He never made his way around the store either.   On both visits, the food was sub par.  The fried pickles were fairly drenched in grease.  The wings also were not the greatest. I don't know why the two Hooters locations in Charlotte have gone downhill as much as they have, but I recommend avoiding them for now.",

How?! They charged me  $24 on both orders without using my discount code. ON TOP OF THAT THEY GAVE ME ALL FLATS ON BOTH ORDERS AND ONE DRUM!!!!! I never asked for flats.. My wings were wet and didn't have much flavor. When speaking to the manager, I was offered 10 free wings to make it better after ordering 40 WET all FLAT wings!!! the other 10 wings going to be wet as well..My family loves Hooters but this location needs to do better!",

Waitress replies \"I told you you had to order 10\" in a snippy voice. Woah. I clearly remember what I was told. I'm telling you, I only had 8. Act of Congress to get the check fixed. Waitress can't count. Basic math was too hard. Wrong change. Fixed it. Didn't have the correct change and asked if that was okay. L. O. L. What a freaking joke.

    "text": "Since apparently it's the only place uptown that has the Saturday night fights, we checked into Hooters for a few drinks and little UFC...   This was not my first trip to a Hooters, but my first time to this location, though really - what's the difference? Girls in unflattering outfits (yes, some pull it off, but a lot do not), sub par food, odd amounts of parents with their children, and enough liquor to quench your thirst.   We were seated near plenty of TVs, ordered our drinks and everything seemed fine. We were checked on just enough (every time our drinks hit 2/3 empty) and from what I could tell, it was going to be a decent few hours even though out of every corner of my eye I could see a child squirming around in their chair. Then, there was the shift change... new waitress, new division of tables, and adios decent service! I could catch glimpses of her bleached hair, but could never make eye contact so our drinks sat empty, and then we had to wait forever for the check, and then even longer for her to come back with my card... I would have been a little more understanding if they were slammed, but for a bar uptown on a Saturday night, they weren't even close.  If I ever find myself in this Hooters again, I'm going to sit at the bar.",

The manager was very accommodating to us and made sure the football game was on the tv's nearest us so we all had a great view.  We had a new Hooters newbies with us, and I think they left impressed.  This Hooters is impressively large for a downtown location.  Plenty of seating including an outdoor patio.",

If you see the yellow caution tripod at a table near you....yep another drunk tossed his chicken....that means their hazmat crew has just cleaned up a barfectomy.  They even used a bleach bottle to spray this area down after they kicked vomit boy out.  Can you imagine the aroma of the combo of wings and clorox? The service was slow.  The waitress got the drink order wrong.  But she did thank us for not vomiting and being good \"sports\" after watching the guy next to us hurl.  I say, do not go here. Find another place nearby...I'm sure the Champion's in the Marriott right across the street will have better food and a better atmosphere.",

The food is the absolute worst of any chain restaurant, bar none.  I would eat McDonald's before eating Hooter's.  I love, love, LOVE wings and sadly Hooter's can't even do a decent wing.  But the waitresses are always very friendly, what more could you want to gape (I mean gaze) at while nursing a healthy buzz and watching football?",

    "text": "All right.  If you're a straight lady going to Hooters then you're going for the wings.  Am I right?  Unless you're trying to prove something.  And I think I've been good about saying this - heck, I haven't had to say it yet because the QC has been a pleasant surprise for the most part - but every Hooters in Chicagoland has better wings than this Hooters.  Hell, the Hooters in Puerto Vallarta had better wings.  These were not as flavorful, the batter was not as... I don't know, flakey I suppose.  They were extremely mediocre.  Now I prefer to go to a small local joint over a chain most of the time, I prefer to try something new.  So dang it, if I want Hooters wings, they need to taste like Hooters wings!  Standardization, people!  Bah. Well, the server was sweet at least.  Sometimes when a couple walks into a Hooters, they get snubbed a bit because the waitresses are all leaning over the horny businessman tables trying to get tips. But Shaun (I think that was how it was spelled) was nice.",

I've been to this Hooters location 3 or 4 times and only once did I have a friendly waitress, who sat with me and chatted with me for a bit.  The other times, I was pretty much ignored by my waitress, who took my food order, brought out my food, and gave me my check, all without any chatting, conversation, or visiting my table to flirt.  I mean, I can go to any bar in town for that.  I go to Hooters because I want a cute girl in a skin tight outfit to pretend that she's into me.  That's part of the appeal.
