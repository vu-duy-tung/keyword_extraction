There were a million kids running around and the parents did nothing. I understand kids can be loud but this was awful. The table next to us tried to tell the kids to quiet down very politely but it did not work. It was so bad where I was yelling at my friend so she could hear me. Well, after the families left the manager came over to tell the table who complained that they would take care of their bill. Completely BS!!!! Not coming back here again. The waiter even said those kids were the worst thing that happened to him all day. Employees complained.",

The server was good however the food took a while to get to us.  I had a caesar salad which may have been the worst one I've ever had.  It appeared to be iceburg lettuce and the dressing was given to me in a plastic container on the side. I don't know why a restaurant with that price range would serve something like that.  My Angus Ribeye steak was very good but the onion rings tasted like they came frozen out of a bag.  The chocolate cake was very good though.  I will give it another try if I have a coupon.  With all the competition for the public's dollars, the restaurant has to hit a home run on all the dishes.",

During the meal the waiter never checked back and we were without water for most of the meal.  We noticed annoyed customers who also had that waiter.  Filet mignon tasted old and almost pork-like.

We sat for 15 minutes before anyone initially came up to our table. Upon ordering a burger, the description states, \"cheese option available.\"  When I asked him what cheese they have, he asked me \"well what do you want?\" I proceed to tell him, I don't want cheddar, what other options do you have? He replied with, \"well we have a ton of options, what do you want?\" As he is saying this, he proceeds to have a conceited smile on his face. Feeling very frustrated, I just replied back with provolone, as he is walking away. He turns around and yells out, do you want fries with that? It doesn't bother me that maybe he didn't know all the cheese options, it was the way he spoke and communicated it to me.  Later we got our food and he never came back at any time to check on us or if we needed anything else. We had to ask twice for water refills.  Meanwhile, it is 2pm on a Friday afternoon and there was only 1 other table seated in the restaurant. It was one of the worst experiences I have ever received anywhere and will never recommend this place to anyone I know. If I could give zero stars, I would.",

Two things that peaked my interest. 1 - Received an email that I could receive 30% off if I used my Ballantyne Corporate Perks card and 2- It's close to my office.  The dining room has a cabin feel and almost an intimate vibe with the fireplace going.  Their sanitation score was a 97...check! The bathrooms looked great. They were clean, smelled fresh and everything was stocked...check! Everything about this place was almost perfect until we received our food.  I ordered the firecracker shrimp wrap and my colleague ordered the chicken and pear salad. The girl who brought the food out asked which one had the Asian salad, which was neither one of us.  My coworker said no she had the chicken and pear...the waitress immediately corrected herself and said \"I meant the Chicken and Pear\". My friend said no that's not it because there is mushrooms on it. So she took it back and a few minutes later brought out the actual chicken and pear.  No problems there since the kitchen quickly corrected their mistake. My friend was not overly thrilled with her salad but she did eat it all.  Now onto my wrap.  It was so bad I didn't even eat half of it.  The fries were awesome...but the wrap was terrible.   2 Stars for environment and cleanliness.",

    "text": "My visit not as great today as my first visit. This time I knew to order my salad (salmon/spinach) WITHOUT onions.  So, I get my salad and it has those awful red onions diced so small that you cant easily pick them out. BLEH!! I detest raw onions - ESPECIALLY the red ones.   So when our server finally makes it back around to check on our table, I showed her the onions and reminded her that I had ordered without. She took it back so they could remake it...and I waited & waited & waited....   When she finally brought it back out, my dining companions had already finished their meals. Since we have already been gone for an hour, I asked her to go ahead & box it so I could take it back to the office to eat.  Waiting for it to be boxed took a long time too... WTH? I should have asked her to bring the container to the table so I could do it myself. Sigh.   When I finally got back to office & had a chance to eat, the mood was ruined for me. I did not enjoy my salad and certainly did not enjoy my overall dining experience.   For the $ I definitely expect better from them.",

My favorite is their Daisy Duke chicken sandwich because it has mayonnaise lol the chicken is very moist an flavorful. I've had a side salad w it an their Mac n cheese. I'm a southern girl I know my mac n cheese delish it passed my high standards, creamy n not a powder cheese it's real cheese yum. I just had din there last night an ordered the burger which they will substitute a turkey burger for you. However I wish I'd know it was just a frozen patty they put in the grill not good . Now they also have an amazing appetizer chips w guacamole/salsa/pimento cheese great to share before ur meal . I'll b back thee for sure they have a smothered chicken sandwich I've seems looks n smells amazing . Try it out an normally they have a special on wine last night was half off I believe.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for 6 at 6:00pm on a Saturday.  We got there extra early and to my surprise this place was mostly empty.  We got a nice corner booth for our group and Catherine was very friendly and attentive.  I was pleased there was a 4 course dinner for 2 for $50 (cuz I'm cheap) Fried pickles are really just perfect.  They're long slices so the salty is not overpowering (yes I have an issue with circular fried pickles).  The house salads came out wrong.  there were 4 brought out instead of 3, with the toppings and dressings wrong.  Instead of taking it back she gave me a salad with no dressing to sit there and wait for her to return.  Kind of weird procedure to leave inedible food in front of me, but second attempt was all 3 correct salads.  The meatloaf was fantastic!  Topped with onions and pimiento cheese, thick slices that were grilled so it had a nice char on it, served with lumpy potatoes (just that way I like it!).  I did not care for the southern style green beans, as they were surprisingly flavorless.  We were stuffed from everything else, so I took a cheesecake home.  It was tri-layered chocolate mousse, cheesecake and a cookie crust.  Overall, it was pretty good the next day. I really like a wood decor - it felt intimate enough in the booth that they sold the log cabin feel very well.  I saw a nice sized patio I'd be happy to check out at my next visit.  The entire menu looked wonderful!  Great prices too",

We sat down and the waiter came and got our drink orders and that was about the last time he brought us drinks and or refills. We had to ask the manager and 2 other members each time to get a simple refill. The waiter did not come by to ask if we needed anything. We ordered appetizers and the wings came out 30 minutes later. The wings were good but took way to long. After that out enters came 45 minutes later. We complained the the manager and his reply was we can cancel for you, no apologies or anything. I did not expect anything to be free but something should of bee on the managers part. Not a sorry or anything.     I would not return because of the manager. I don't expect his staff to be trained appropriately if he is the manager. The ownership should really re think who they have leading their staff.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to grab dinner and drinks on a Tuesday after work, and after seeing pictures of the patio on their Facebook page, we knew that's where we wanted to be!  At 6 p.m., the patio was maybe half full, and I appreciated the options of high top tables, low top tables, and comfy looking couches in front of the TVs and fireplace.  We chose a low top table, which was really comfortable.  Overall, I felt like I was hanging out on a friend's patio - it didn't feel \"restauranty.\"    Our waitress was really nice and helpful; she could've gotten to us just a smidgen faster, but we weren't in a hurry, so I didn't mind.    Tuesday are half off glasses of wine, so we had a couple of glasses.  For dinner, I ordered the raspberry fields salad - the chicken tasted fresh and warm, which was a nice juxtaposition to the cold salad greens and fruit.  My friend got the firecracker shrimp tacos, which she said were really good . I thought they looked pretty interesting since it was a hard shell taco wrapped in a soft shell taco, and the shrimp were HUGE.  It came with black beans and rice, and there wasn't much left, so I guess she did like it!  Overall, I think it's a great addition to Ballantyne, and I really hope it makes it since many others haven't.  It seems like a nice, casual, restaurant with a lower price point than Vine (which is right across the street), and I'm excited to go back.",

I got a burger and my wife got the blackened chicken pasta (her favorite). She said her pasta had no blackened flavor, and it did not look like the chicken was really seasoned like it has been in the past. She actually sent it back and got something else which I have never seen her do before. My burger was over cooked past well done. I ordered medium well because this place usually has them cooked medium or less and I don't really trust hamburger meat at most places cooked at this temperature. SO it was pretty dry and uninspired. The last 3 times we had 2 bad experiences and one mediocre so my wife said she will not go back. It is a shame to see some place that was once good go downhill like this. We need to find some more date night spots, please send recommendations.",

I was willing to let it go and give them the benefit of the doubt, until our waiter wanted to make a joke as we were paying the check. Our waiter made a joke about  the special olympics and handicapped people. My fiance has a handicapped brother and we did NOT find his joke funny AT ALL.

Excellent place with lots of room and a very nice outdoor, covered patio with a stone fireplace.  Menu is great, lots of choices to include children offerings.  The lunch menu is abbreviated, but there are adequate options.  I love their Fire Cracker Shrimp, on salad or as a entre.  It will truly light up your life, so if you are not into spicy, don't go there.  Lunch menu has lots of salads, sandwiches, soups, tacos, burgers and entrees.  More than enough and with a full bar you might go with a crisp white wine to go with them fire crackers.  Dinner has much more to offer with lots of chicken, steak, ribs and seafood options.  The darkish dining room can be pretty romantic.  Just an idea.  Service is good and prompt.  Kitchen keeps up with the flow and you can do reasonable substitutions.  Sun City residents get a discount and they offer some others, so ask.  A good choice for good food, service and drinks.",

    "text": "My last visit here this week caused me to lower my rating of the place.    This visit I ordered the salmon which came with a huge portion of salmon on a cedar plank and mixed veggies.   The veggies were great.  The edges of the salmon were great also but once I got into the center of the salmon, it was raw.  I didn't come here for sushi and actually lost my appetite once I saw the raw portion.  Not only was my salmon bad but my colleague ordered a medium well burger and it came out medium rare.  What made this experience worse is how the staff handled the situation.  Our server commented that she was sorry, she would take it away.  Obviously she didn't know what to do.  Eventually she brought over a manager who asked what was wrong.  When we told him about the problems, he didn't seem to care.  The real kicker was when he asked if I wanted to take the salmon home.  Really?  Sure, I could take it home and cook it but that was their job.    The last issue was we ordered an chip dip appetizer which on Wednesdays is $5 and we were charged $10 when the check arrived.  We were talking about it when our server overheard it and came back and said she updated the check.  Also, The manager eventually took the two bad orders off the check.  This incident may not stop me from returning.  As I said in my previous review, the meat loaf was great and I've heard the firecracker shrimp and fish tacos are good.  But I will stay away from the salmon in the future.   There are definitely inconsistency issues here and the staff doesn't seem to know how to handle the issues.",

It's literally 1 minute from my job and I never stopped in until now. I went in for lunch, but it was around 2pm so there wasn't much of a crowd. When I walked in there was nobody at the Hostess stand, I had to wait a few minutes for someone to show up. I didn't even see servers walking by to flag down. But when she arrived she was friendly, patient and helpful. I went with the Firecracker Shrimp Spinach Wrap & Green Beans as my side. Less than 10 minutes later my togo order was ready! The Wrap was so delicious! I was a little worried. I don't normally like fried foods in my wraps because they have a tendency to be soft fried or soggy. But not this wrap. Even with the sauce on the shrimp they were still crispy and the shrimp were tender. This is going to be one of my new lunchtime go-to's! Now the Green Beans i'll probably pass on next time. The seasoning just didn't go anything for me. You can tell they were cooked in meat or fat... but they forgot the salt and seasonings. They were just bland. I'll try something else next time.",

    "text": "I have to say what just happened to me in this resturant was appalling and embarrassing to say the least! I took my family there after church for Easter brunch since this has been my go to place every since they open a few years back. I go to order my normal kids menu item that I've been ordering for the past year and the server said no. He is a new server to me so I explained to him that I had gastric surgery last year and that the resturant has always accommodated me in the past. The server said to me that he would have to get with his manager. I said that's fine, I know most of them from coming in. Needless to say the co owner Robert come over and tells me that he will not allow me to order off the kids menu, that I have to order off the regular menu. He then said \"whoever has allowed this before needs to be fired\". I was upset and embarrassed but said to my family ok because I didn't want to cause a scene further. Then Robert proceeds to tell me that's \"it's people like you that's going to cause us to go out of business\" excuse me No it's people like you that should not be in business. I'm in business and I understand the whole food cost etc of his business. I also understand that people take advantage of ordering kids meals but when I tell you the reasoning behind me wanting to order it because I can not eat that much, that you dont offer a smaller plate or smaller portion options on your menu and wasn't trying to save money you should of accommodated me or anyone else in my position. It's just down right rude! To the other co owner, you should buy him out! Cut ties! To  managers, servers and everyone else that works there, I'm sorry you have to work for someone like that. I'm only one voice and will probably be overlooked but there is a lot of us out here that has had this surgery.  We are given a card to show that we have had this surgery as proof so when or if we do encounter people like Robert we can show them and I would of gladly shown you mine if given the chance.",

    "text": "Went here today. Giving it 5 because their Lodge Meatloaf is the greatest version of meat loaf I've ever eaten. Baked, then quickly grilled, topped with onions, mushrooms, and a wad of gooey pimento cheese, it was supremely decadent for being a giant slab of greasy meat. Served it with mashed potatoes, and I subbed out the green beans for the grilled baby bok choy, which is an absolute MUST.  Their wings were good. Nothing insane. Garlic parm wings were the best I tried. Their fried pickles were awesome. Full pickle spears, great idea! Beer selection was fine, nothing too fancy.   Decent price range. Menu had options for as low as $7-8, and for as high as $29-30, so there's a little something for everyone. That meat loaf though...get yourself an Uber ride home afterwards or you might fall asleep in the car on the way home.",

My usual two things I always order are the Firecracker Tacos or the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. The Tacos are by far my favorite and an absolute hit. They come with a hard and a soft shell. The sauce is sweet yet spicy-similar to Bonefish's Bang Bang Shrimp. Simply put they are great! The Buffalo Chicken sandwich is perfectly fried and very big portion. The mixed drinks from the bar have always been on point too.  The service has been hit or miss for me. Sometimes it has been over and beyond amazing, sometimes not so hot. Overall, a solid option I would recommend!",

She told us about the restaurant week specials and told us we could order from the menu or take advantage of the restaurant week special. The special came with appetizers for each of us, a main course meal for each and a dessert choice. Wifey had a kale salad to start, followed by Salmon and vegetables for her main course and key lime pie for dessert. I had firecracker shrimp to start, ribs with fries and Mac&Cheese and salted caramel cheesecake for dessert. They also had drink specials which we took advantage of. The food and service IMO were top notch and welcomed being these two are hard to find together anymore. We will go back.",

We had just the right amount of time to enjoy our appetizers before our main entrees were brought out.  Me and my dad both ordered filets medium and they were perfect!  The other steak was ordered medium well and came out more medium but was thoroughly enjoyed so no complaints there! Our server didn't seem to be in the best mood but did his job very well.  He always made sure our drinks were filled and offered to box up my brother's meal when I asked if I could have a box to do it myself. As for the food itself, the three of us split three different appetizers: the firecracker shrimp, crab cakes, and filet kabobs.  The firecracker shrimp were the best of the three and got rave reviews from both my companions.  We all got the surf and turf entree and were very satisfied with the filet, shrimp, potatoes, and asparagus.  As for the desserts, I tried both the key lime pie and tuxedo mousse cheesecake and thought they were both delicious!",

My husband and I have been there 3 times by ourselves, with friends and with my mother. Each experience was differnt but pretty good in my opinion. Every new place will have some humps along the way and the beer menu and some servers are things that need some fine tweeking. I have had the Jerk Chicken tacos and the Fish tacos both are STUFFED and any normal person could get full off of just one but they serve you two. The tacos have been my favorite dish so far having a hard shell taco wrapped in a flour tortilla and good side choices if you dont want the beans and rice that come with it. We have also had the Buffalo chicken dip which I have made myself at home but have gotten on 2 sperate visits because its that good.   Good food, decent prices for the area, but some work needed on the bar (beer choices and menu also training staff on what differnt type drinks available). Lots of this can just be ironed out after expierence. Glad to have a new place in the neighborhood!!  Oh and I almost forgot, when it gets warmer they have an Awesome outdoor area!",

The first time was lovely. We enjoyed a meal on the patio, enjoyed a few drinks, and had a super attentive waitress.  Tonight, however, was a disaster.  We got our drink relatively fast and Our wa took our order and then...poof.... she was gone.  Someone else delivered our food to the table. The salads we so overdressed they were almost inedible.  We all ran empty on drinks and my husband finally went to the bar to get refills on his own.  Only then did she ask him if he needed anything.  She brought those and disappears again. We were able to flag her down to get dessert for our daughter. It came out very quickly and the brownie (obviously microwaved to warm it up) was to hot it burned her mouth.  As we were finishing dessert we asked for the check.  She said ok, grabbed our unfinished dessert, and left us sitting there waiting again.  Desserts are a little expensive to be snatched before we can even finish them.  Only upon exiting did we discover she was covering a large party at the bar.  I guess our 55 dollar tab wasn't important enough to get quality service. So sad.  I really wanted to love Stone Mountain Grille.",

The fish tacos were wonderful, and the portion was huge...a crunchy shell inside a soft tortilla, and correct proportion of fish to veggies, guacamole was yummy but my favorite part was the spicy sauce they put on. My table also tried the chicken quesadilla, and it was also well received. I was hugely impressed with the variety on the kids menu and the amount of food was enough for my 1 & 3 year old to split...they had the cheeseburger (which was 2 sliders) and mac & cheese, and the meal also included a drink & ice cream, all for $5! We will xefinately be back, and most certainly will sit in Jordan's section again!",

The creole pasta...shrimp was fine but not sure what other meat was on there suppose to be lobster pretty sure it was crawfish or shredded weird meat and the pasta was way overcooked. Great drink spot bad food spot",

Our server was clearly new to the role but by no means sub par - she put a lot of effort into making sure we had everything we needed (we tipped her 25% because of her attitude).   All in all a great experience. The appetizer of baked Brie and wild berries sounded great, however we didn't order it. The chicken tacos were excellent with a mango salsa and the smothered chicken was very homey. No dessert for us.   This is a good place for groups and/or children - it has an average noise level and plenty of space.",

No surprised here for brunch as this is an American restaurant, so has your basic omelette and egg sandwich options. We had a few issues with the service in terms of having to ask another server for some items since ours was sometimes hard to get a hold of.  The food was fine as we aren't expecting something that pushes the tastebuds. The atmosphere was tailored to more for lunch or dinner as it reminds me of most american chain restaurants but with a mountain/western decor. It did feel like we were outside of Charlotte so that was a nice effect. I probably wouldn't come back for brunch since it wasn't anything special but I'd have to try it for dinner and check out the rest of the menu.",

The food was mediocre at best, steak was not cooked properly (ribeye) and the potatoes looked like a 3 year old prepared them. I am pretty sure they were supposed to be mashed, but they were not in the least. They were not even cooked properly. The waitress that served our table of 4 was not friendly and had an attitude when we asked about the gluten free menu. The Cesar salads had way too much anchovies in them, one person in our party barely ate any of his due to the pungent flavor. The table we sat at was in a corner by another large table and the back of our chairs kept getting hit by folks passing by or serving that table. It was a $100 total for all 4 of us, we could have spent less for a better meal and better service elsewhere.",

We love stouffers and eat it often, However would expect a nice restaurant to make their own Mac n cheese. This evening I ordered their green beans and they were clearly canned green beans. Not impressed. Also, their side salads could use improvement. Again, we order from this restaurant regularly because the main course/entree's are always good.

Our waiter Jeremy was excellent and even accommodated our immature requests to have him recite Matthew McConaughey movie quotes! He ran down the drink specials and I ordered the pineapple mango martini. After the first sip, it was clear that I could guzzle it, so I drank it up and ordered a dirty martini so I could be sure to sip at a slower place. I'm pretty picky about a dirty martini and this one was perfect. We ordered the brie plate which came with a ton of crackers as well as a large bunch of grapes, raspberries, apples and blackberries. The brie was warm and gooey and just the way I like it. I ordered the blackened grouper and mashed potatoes. Grouper is my favorite fish and to be honest, I'm not sure this was grouper. The mashed potatoes were yummy but I'm not sure I would order this fish again. It was too thin for my liking. Overall, the place was warm and cozy and ALL the staff were nice and accommodating.

It was at 6:30 and not terribly busy when we got in there. Our waiter David A was already getting a little stressed by the time he got to our table, he decided to take out drink orders and then come back for our Dinner order. Four adult orders and a childs order. We waited a tiny while for our drinks and then placed our dinner orders. We had appetizers and salads and our entree's placed.  The back waiters came out with two appetizers. We ordered a second set of drinks. and all of a sudden here was the back waiters with a kids meal and two entree's NO salads! We said..wait the salads have not come out yet! They said, This is the way it came up. We said.. wait...not what we wanted. They never answered and continued to bring out the two other entree's . Our waiter came back around and apologized to us. But did nothing else. About 10 minutes later the salads came out. We asked to speak to the manager but no one came. Now on to the food, I had ordered the specialty appetizer which was Fried Cauliflower, it was really crisply fried and tasty. We also, at our table, had the  Fried Bang Bang Shrimp, very good. The salads , though served AFTER the Entree were crisp and delicious, Not to be served while your entree is getting cold on the table. The dinners, were okay, There was two Fried Trout entrees, and one Mahi Mahi and one Hamburger. The Trout was a big portion but very dry and thin and needed a sauce of some sort. Two Tiny pieces of lemon dressed it. The Mahi Mahi was good but also lacked enough pico. My husband did like his burger but it was with out condiments that you usually get with your burger, which we did ask for ketchup but it did not come till he was almost done with his burger. Only one dessert came,  which was the Key Lime Pie, which was good and authentic. Our waiter, although very nice and friendly was very stressed and over wrought with his amount of tables. I felt sorry for him . I don't think I will be returning to Stone Mountain Grill, it just did not put forth enough effort for a fairly expensive dinner.  Sorry ...",

We ordered the fried pickles to start, and I thought they were great!  The crust on them was crunchy AND is stayed put (didn't slip off or crumble away covered in grease)... and I had a Grey Goose martini (it was perfect!)...  I ordered the cedar plank salmon, cooked medium, with asparagus and an extra side of mashed potatoes... everything was cooked very well... the asparagus was not over done, the salmon was tender, flaky, and delicious, and the mashed potatoes are dangerous!  They brought us a warm, gooey brownie sundae for my birthday.  We ate it with embarrassing speed!!  All in all, this place has a nice, cozy atmosphere which can be dressed up a little, but mostly good for jeans and family dinners... the food is good (not overly unique or fancy, but if you want a good meal at a decent price, this place makes for a nice change), the drinks are well made, and the service is excellent!  Give it a try if you're in the area!",

I liked that I could order take out and it was later in the evening so my salad was ready in 10 minutes.  I ordered the pear and chicken salad.  It was good.  Nothing fantastic but better than getting fast food somewhere else.  I would say it's a good choice if ur staying at the stay bridge sweets but it reminds you of any other chain restaurant you would see when traveling anywhere.",

    "text": "I always forget about this place but won't after dining there yesterday. We went for their Memorial Day BOGO Steak event. Altho they don't offer a bread basket I didn't mind bc they use that (possibly) wasted investment on the quality of food instead. Smart! The Pomegranate Martini special was an excellent pour and tasty mix ($5). To start, a side salad of dark, leafy romaine topped with raspberry dressing, shreaded cheeses, diced cucumber & potato sticks ($3).  It was nicely chilled and crispy. My friend & I both ordered the Chargrilled center-cut Angus Ribeye topped w. garlic butter, medium rare-plus and it was the best we've both had in a long time! The temp on this 12oz. steak came to the table exactly as ordered, was so tender we could use a butter knife and wasn't smothered with seasoning - which was refreshing as it is a petpeeve when chefs mask food with stuff. We split our sides of the smokey, roasted bok choy & smashed potatoes. Both were excellent! Each dinner was $21.99 each, minus the BOGO, we each had a ribeye steak dinner for $11. Drink, salad, steak & (2) sides, bc we shared them, for under $23. Can't beat that! Another friend had the Mahi dinner which was a great cut & seasoned and cooked to perfection! Bravo! Now for service .... Chris and teammates never left us asking/wanting for anything! A well-oiled machine, with eyes on all tables, working together. Upbeat, knowledgable and readily available, even for a couple of photo shots! A wonderful experience!  As I recall, the other 3xs I went here I was also very happy. Stone Mtn. Grill has our business, without question! As a matter of fact I plan to grab this special offer again, before it ends Memorial Day!",

We had an early reservation (5:15) so it wasn't too busy yet and since none of us had ever been to SMG I was a little worried - boy was I wrong!!!!!   This place is awesome!!!!!!   Our waiter was great, the food was beyond amazing & we couldn't beat the $30 QueensFeast price.    5 of the 6 of us had the wedge salad (zero complaints from anyone) then 4 of the group had prime rib while 2 of us had the surf and turf.   WOW!   All of us were amazed at the portion sizes (the prime rib was huge and so so good!!!) and the filet was so tender and cooked to perfection!!   Their bacon wrapped bbq shrimp were also huge and tasted so good!!   Then the desserts- wow!   The salted Carmel cheesecake was melt in your mouth delicious and the key lime pie was definitely home made and had just the right amount of lime \"pucker.\"   After gorging ourselves we also had some coffee and it was fabulous also!    None of us had ever been before but I can promise we will be back!!!!",

Once I had a lunch of a fish tacos and did not enjoy it- hardly any fish  in the taco. However  their dinners are especially good. I have  enjoyed the cedar planked salmon as well as steak dinners. The atmosphere was comfortable , the waitress was exceptionally attentive.   Since it was restaurant week we decided to order from that menu. For $35  one  can choose an appetizer , main course and a dessert  with a variety of  selections from each group .  My dining mate and I had the fish , the mahi-mahi as the main course. Our friends had the steak, and the surf and turf. For appetizers we ordered  the  tomato  stack,  2  orders of barbecued bacon wrapped  shrimp appetizers ,  and  a wedge salad . Dessert were the  salted caramel cheesecake and a key lime pie . Portions were  good , food came out hot and was plated nicely . Meat and fish cooked perfectly and tender. Everything was tasty and delicious . Menu prices reasonable.  Beer and wine menu too. We would certainly return again for another dinner.",

By the time we left, people were waiting in the lobby - a hopeful sign for a restaurant operating in a location where two have failed.   We ordered the crab cakes appetizer, and were surprised that we only got 3 smallish cakes for $12.  My wife had the Smothered Chicken, which was very good.  I had the meatloaf.  The flavor of the meatloaf was good, but the covering of pimento spread was odd and did not seem to add anything from my perspective.  The green beans that came with both dinners had good flavor, but were way overcooked.  The portion sizes were generous.  Service was just OK, but it was their busiest time.  Overall, it was OK-to-good.",

Once we got past what it's not and what it is (which took us a while to do), we enjoyed our dinners.  The service was decent, food was tasty and reasonably priced.  Definitely get the 20 percent coupon by signing up for their email club...not sure how long that promo is going on for, but worth the try.  This place isn't healthy...even the salad had fried potato strings on it...with cheese and bacon...but I'm sure there's a couple of dishes for those watching calories.  Like the other reviewers, it was loud (especially during game time) but the bar area looks like a lot of fun for that activity.  While the dining room had tons of families and kids, which is great for this area.  Net is that this is not a date night place...We would return with the right mindset, lunch and enjoy the patio and catching a game.  Agree with other reviewers...great to see another option like this in the hood and hope it thrives!",

Their Queen's Feast menu sounded fantastic, but the food quality was very banquet-like. My oysters rockefeller were fried dough balls with no discernable oyster, sitting on a bed of creamed spinach that tasted canned. My filet oscar, while cooked perfectly, was tough and not very flavorful. The sauce was more \"Bernie\" than \"Bearnaise.\" While our server was absolutely as nice as he could be, the kitchen was backed up and our meal took 2.5 hours. He got the checks all mixed up, too. Sadly, the meal was quite a disappointment, especially compared to the other wonderful QF restaurants we could have selected.",

    "text": "I was in Charlotte for business and to visit family.  We decided to try Stone Mountain since it had recently opened and is near my family home.  The atmosphere was fantastic.  We sat outside on the patio which is decorated like a cabin.  There are large TVs, a fireplace, and cozy couches.  We started with the spicy shrimp appetizer.  It was delicious.  They serve the same shrimp in their tacos- which I plan on trying the next time. My dining partner ordered the wings and loved them.   I ordered a flat bread pizza.  The pizza was not that great.  It was soggy and all of the toppings slid off of the pizza.  I am not one to complain.  Especially, since I was not sure if that was just how it was supposed to be and I ordered poorly.  I am giving this restaurant 4 stars because (I wish I could remember his name and position) a gentleman came to our table as we were nearing the end of our meal and had asked how my pizza was.  I was honest and nice as I explained.  He stated that they were new to making the \"hearth baked\" pizzas and the dough is made fresh daily and they were having trouble with the dough rising and cooking crisp.  He apologized and stated that they had eliminated pizza from the menu for the remainder of the evening since they were having trouble.  He removed the pizza from our bill and gave us free appetizer cards to use on our next visit.  As someone who eats out often, I appreciate this service.  I appreciate anyone that can admit a mistake and apologize.  I did not have to complain or bring it to his attention.  The restaurant noticed the mistake and took the initiative to still ensure our evening was pleasant.  I would absolutely go back to this restaurant.  The food that had been made correctly was amazing and they, clearly, have a great staff who take pride in food and service.",

We were more than impressed with the service - our waitress Amani was very sweet and did a great job serving. You also get a lot more \"extras\" than other comparable restaurants- They do a free birthday dessert, ice cream comes with all kids meals, etc. We came on a Wednesday which was also half priced wine and $5 appetizer specials. (You can tell we love a deal!) ;-) Our table was greeted by the chef and manager, Everyone was very friendly. Food was good quality - we had several dishes, salmon, Mai mahi, meatloaf and steak. The food was simply seasoned and came out fairly quickly. We had our 2 and 4 year old with us and the atmosphere is nice but also loud enough to mask any screaming/whining etc that usually comes with bringing the kiddos. Lastly there is a cute patio area with lots of TVs that is enclosed to be all weather- we didn't eat there but it looked like a fun place to sit and have drinks or watch a game. We were satisfied and would definitely come back!",

If you have a reservation, the bartenders prefer you to be served by your assigned wait staff so that the tips are fair, sounds weird but also a great concept, means the staff works well together.  They give you these fried asparagus at the bar that are delicious.  We also had chips and dips platter and firecracker shrimp.  So if you're on the sriracha craze, you'll love the firecracker shrimp.  the chips and dips, the guacamole was impressive, it had a lot of flavor to it, wish it was a larger portion, the salsa and pimento cheese was good but I would have been happy if it was just guac and chips.  Main meal, I had a ribeye, caesar salad and chocolate cake.  Meal was good, nothing that really stood out, but no complaints.  The attention from the servers were great and I thought they handled a large crowd on a relatively busy night very well.  Ambiance is nice, they also have an outdoor area but since it's record heat, staying inside was a better choice, but on a nice spring evening, I would opt to sit outside.",

Our waiter didn't return to check on us after appetizer came.  Mind you that the restaurant was pretty empty with plenty of staff but most just talking to eachother.  The second appetizer was just warm not hot.  Our entrees were no better also being warm and not hot.  We didn't send them back but only ate a few bites.  We ran out of drinks and never saw our waiter even after entrees came out.  I finally got tired of waiting and went to the hostess desk to ask for someone to refill our water and soda.  The manager was there and didn't even introduce himself!  Waiter came by and after explaining to him our issues I asked for the manager. To my surprise it was same man at hostess desk!  He was condescending when he said he regretted the food didn't meet my expectations, still never told us his name.  He said he would take care of the bill but mind you we still had no drinks!!  We will not be returning to this restaurant.  It's a shame but there are too many places to choose from to have bad food and service.",

We were seated immediately and noticed the place was nearly empty (at 4:30pm)...thought that a bit odd.  Yes there are fire-places but it was freezing inside. My husband's a tough guy and I think this is the first time he's ever complained about the temperature in a restaurant.  Our waitress had a nice smile and was friendly and attentive. However, the reason for the 2 stars is because this restaurant lacks polish. The music is too loud, the manager is insensitive to diners by almost yelling (because the music is so loud) to someone out of our line of sight, laughing and carrying on (very unprofessional); the chicken quesadillas were very good and my husband seemed to enjoy his burger but my blackened southern chicken sandwich was rubbery (yuck) and had way too much avocado. The fries were way over-salted and not nearly crispy enough (soggy fries).  I think this place has potential but needs quite a bit of fine-tuning.",

    "text": "Let me state up front that we decided to have dinner here on a Friday evening for one reason: A $20 off coupon. My opinion after this, our second meal here, mirrors those of my fellow Yelp Eliters: Ho-hum.  It's not that it doesn't have potential or its good points. It just can't seem be anything but average. My wife and I both ordered the Crab Encrusted Mahi with side salads. The side salads were topped with fresh bacon and were okay. The Mahi however was overcooked and the brocolli side was mushy, also overcooked.  My wife sent hers back and our superb waiter, JD, apologized and, 15 minutes later, a man that we think was the manager politely served up her a Planked Salmon as a replacement. He also apologized.  She ate it alone however as I had already finished mine before it got cold. We were offered nothing for our inconvenience.  Total bill after coupon was $50 including tip. If you're gonna charge $20 plus for most of your entrees, you better be able to \"bring it\", and I am not convinced this place will ever be able to do that.  In my opinion, what keeps them in business is their location in a vast Ballantyne corporate business park among several hotels.  Overall, service was friendly and, for the most part, attentive, the sanitation score was a 94 and they do have a lively bar and patio area but I think we're done here. There are just too many much better options in Charlotte to settle for average. Rating-wise it's closer to a 2.5 than a 2. I just can't justify rounding up to a 3.",

I had their Caesar with blackened salmon.  The salad was extremely fresh and tasty, with a perfect amount of dressing tossed in and the salmon was cooked just right.  The staff was great.  They were very welcoming and friendly, and the service was fabulous.  Drinks were consistently filled and service very quick and efficient.  The prices were very reasonable and certainly in line with a restaurant of its caliber.  There is parking immediately outside in a dedicated lot, and it was easy to access from the surrounding streets --though it can get congested during rush hour traffic.  I honestly didn't know this restaurant existed until I received the invite.  Its nestled off of Ballantyne Corporate Parkway and not easily visible from the main roads.  Overall a great experience and delicious food.  I look forward to going back again!",

Everyone we talked to was friendly and helpful, including the manager that showed us to our table. Firecracker Shrimp appetizer was fantastic. The brie was average but came with great crackers and fresh fruit. Meals were good all around. Recommend",

    "text": "By far one of the worst dining experiences of my life.   I set up a reservation on open table for a party of 4 on a saturday night at 8:30 pm. They close at 11pm. We came in and got sat at a table immediately. I noticed that there were 5 tables total including us. I saw several servers walk by us but not one greeted us. Finally, ten minutes later our server walked up and asked what we wanted to drink. We told him and also told him we wanted some fried pickles and the trio dip. It took another 10 mins for him to get our drinks and at this time we only ordered waters and a soda and one beer. He came back and brought everyone's drinks except for the soda. We told him our order. He came back with our soda.   Food runner came and brought our two appetizers but NO little plates. Really annoying and hard to share. No one came to check on us and we couldn't even ask anyone around for the plates. My husband ordered a beer when our server walked by. He didn't get that until the middle of dinner. We also asked for more chips with our trio dip. He never brought that out. Our food came and everyone got their food except for me. I was told they were out of macaroni which was a side item I asked for. Why wouldn't they tell me when they found out? Why bring everyone's food and then tell me. I asked for a menu to look at their side item. He didn't bring me a menu. Someone brought my food and then gave me a menu. I opted for the fruit salad. Server still never came around. My fruit salad came quickly but I got all the crunchy pieces and the portion ratio wasn't good. Two grapes but a ton of melon. We asked someone for more chips and they did bring it out. Server still never came around. People wanted to order more alcohol but wasn't able to. I still needed a refill on my soda and he told me TWICE that he would get me a refill and never did and keep in mind this was 10 mins apart. So it took over 20 mins for a soda refill!! We were done with our food and we needed boxes and no surprise he wasn't around. Finally, we saw a manager and asked for the check. He said ok. But instead of getting the check for us, he tells the server and the server doesn't get it for us til another 10 mins around.   This was like pulling teeth. We were there for over 2 hours which was absolutely ridiculous. They weren't even busy and we were one of a few tables. Horrible service. I will never ever come back here unless I wanted to waste my time.",

Had a reservation, sounds like we have a table in front of the fireplace--sounds good, but it's on the side in a corner-your sitting on the side of the fireplace--great seat if you want to look at brick. We request another table, then they sit us at a table to accommodate a group-like talking across a canyon. The noise level is high, even our waitress couldn't hear stating it was loud. We asked for bread, to which they state they don't have bread but could toast a burger roll? I'm not making this up.  I was looking forward to trying this place out, but think this will be my only visit. We both ordered the crab crusted Mahi.  I think it was previously frozen and not fresh.  The fish was tough and undercooked.  The waitress even agreed and apologized.  We ended up leaving and went someplace else. Definitely won't be back.",

The burgers are big and juicy and come with a side for about $13. That is the going rate even at nearby burger places not fast food. I liked the taste of the burger & switched the side to mashed potatoes. I did takeout once but it was a busy night so it took awhile. Instead I would recommend sitting in the bar and eating at the small bar tables. Lot parking is usually the way to go.",

In this day and age, it is hard to find a place that has limited staff turnover, great menu choice, and a fun ambiance.   They run seasonal specials that are must tries (and I still hope a few end up on the permanent menu).  Wednesday nights, they have half price wine, and offer their signature Firecracker Shrimp Appetizer for $5.    From Burgers to Tacos, Salmon to Steaks, and a few choice Pasta dishes, there is very little here not to like.    Finally, my wife has a few dietary issues around gluten and dairy.  This is THE ONLY place in the area that we have found that can consistently provide diverse options for her.",

Tasted bad since we did not think to check the smell before we took a bite. The Bri app was the highlight of the dinner.  29 dollar fillet was ordered medium it came over well done. I have never had a harder time cutting into a fillet. 27 \" outlaw\" ribeye was ordered medium rare and it came on the medium well side.   Oh I almost forgot about the quarter stick of un melted butter that was in the middle of my mashed potatoes nothing like spitting out a quarter stick of butter at a restaurant while you're trying to eat your anniversary dinner with your wife.  Manager was nice enough to remove the rotted fish that we didn't eat off of our bill. Waste of $110 stay away from this place because it's probably going to be closed real soon",

    "text": "First we had my son's graduation party here last Friday evening.  We reserved the outside patio for this private party.  The atmosphere, staff, and food were all superb!  Everyone enjoyed themselves.  However, the email received making the reservation was vague.  It was from Rob Curtin, General Manager.  It stated, \"The price of $25.99 per person includes a salad choice and an entree choice, plus all beverages, tax and gratuity. The price per person will hold for a minimum of 25 guests.\"  We read this to say that beverages, tax, and gratuity were included.  \"Plus\" in my opinion is a poor choice of words. We were charged for fountain drinks and coffee for all guests that ordered them.  Also, unfortunately, we had less than the required 25 guests. So of course we were charged for 25 dinners, even though we only received 21 meals.  The original receipt had various prices for the entrees.  Then, when we asked for another copy, all entrees were magically $25.99 each.  I definitely enjoy Stone Mountain Grill, however, I would recommend that you be careful and double check your bill prior to paying, especially for large parties.  Overall, magnificent food experience, I just wish negotiations were less ambiguous.",

The fried pickles we had for an appetizer were very good, but that's where the positive ends. The service was uncomfortable, we got there around 9 and they don't close until 11(according to their website) but I was made to feel like we had inconvenienced the whole staff. I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp Wrap which was mediocre and my boyfriend ordered medium well burger. His burger was burnt and hard as a hockey puck, he's never once sent food back but he really had no choice with a $10 burger. His replacement was decent, but obviously pre-made and frozen. On top of all of this, the sweet tea we both ordered was warm and tasted fermented(must have been at least a day and a half old). We both have worked in restaurants for a long time and our experience was bizarre and terrible.   There was never a manager in sight! And the hostesses (when, rarely at the stand) were playing with their hair(very unsanitary) or their phones the entire time! Just skip this place. Very disappointing!",

A couple of the employees passed by and never said that someone was coming and never went to get anyone either. Our food took forever to come out. We had 2 children and waited a long time. People who came after us ordered and were half way done with their food by the time our food came.   Given the history of the location, I dont expect this place to last.",

The food runner dropped some of my ribs on the floor and said he would be back to replace them, he never returned. Honestly that was fine, the ribs were not good. They were cold and the sauce was nothing special.  All in all a huge waste of money and time. We ended up having to eat again an hour later.",

If what I had today was representative the normal here Stone Mountain will follow in the footsteps of its predecessors.    The place itself is fine.  Not much different than Flat Rock.  Our service was also fine, no complaints in that department.  The menu seems great with a lot to choose from.  Burgers, wraps, sandwiches, plenty of entrees.  I ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup which was flat out nasty.  Not sure if this was premade or made in house but it was so overspiced it was metallic tasting.   They could not have tasted it prior to sending it out or else anyone with any slight culinary ability would have rejected it.  I also ordered the Sonoma Chicken Sandwich,  I have never been to Sonoma but the town of Sonoma definitely has a lawsuit on their hands for misrepresentation.  Bland, flavorless and completely lacking imagination.  It had the most awful guacamole on top and the chicken breast was supposed to be blackened which after tasting the over seasoned soup I was shocked that the sandwich was completely void of any blackened flavor.  The sandwich was served with ice cold fries which were quickly replaced by our server with the chefs apologies.    Sweetie had the California Veggie Wrap which was also described as lacking flavor.  She asked our server for some chipotle mayo to see if she could jazz up the blandness to no avail.  Someone else at my table ordered the same thing and wound up dipping the wrap in their bowl of overspiced soup just to try and add some flavor.  In order to make it in this area you have to have great food.  Stone Mountain, on this visit fell way short of my expectations and I will not be back for a second try.",

They didn't have a beer menu, but I was able to get an Angry Orchard cider. It was served with a chilled glass, but from a can. I'm weird about cider in a can, because I think it tastes like a can, so I think that should have been told to me from the beginning, but it was ok.   I ordered a burger with cheese and fries. It came out hot and was really good. Not the best burger ever, but still very tasty and I do recommend it.   They have a frequent diners club that you can sign up for and get 20% off your first bill minus alcohol. It was a great thing for first time diners like us.",

First of all, they did have delicious fried pickles, which were even better dipped in our requested honey mustard. However, the service, the food, and the one drink I ordered were all mediocre at best.  Our server was very sweet, but after she told my boyfriend they did not have a beer menu yet, and she couldn't even think of any of their beers off the top of her head, she did not make any effort to find out what kind of beer he liked and/or find out what beers they offered. I had ordered a Patron margarita, which tasted watered down and bland.  For our entrees, I ordered the Sonoma chicken sandwich, which tasted good, but wasn't anything I couldn't make at home. My side of broccoli was only warm, not hot. My boyfriend ordered the sunrise burger, which had a sunny-side-up egg. The egg had way too much of that undercooked clear, slimy consistency, which my boyfriend carefully scraped off, and his fries were undercooked and under-seasoned as well.  Our dessert was the brownie sundae, which was very dry on the outside, but luckily pretty moist on the inside. It could've been warmer to contrast the cold ice cream. But in their defense, I am picky about brownie sundaes.  On top of everything, they don't do anything special for birthdays. I understand some places don't, but I really think a seemingly upperclass restaurant like this should at least put a candle on our dessert.  Probably won't try this place again anytime soon, which is unfortunate because we could tell they put a lot of work and time into the interior decor.",

I pass this place all the time going to work and never thought about stopping in and likely won't again unless my company is footing the bill. I think a revamp of the menu would go a long way here.

I have tried the cedar plank salmon, which was so tasty I had it again during a second visit.  I had it with the loaded potatoes minus the bacon. And I've experienced the rich decadent chocolate cake - yum!    My experience with the salmon on my second visit however was not as pleasant, because though things started off good at the beginning, as I got closer to the center it was not fully cooked. I had the waiter return it where they finished cooking it.   Fast forward  to today's trip where I went and relaxed a bit while watching the football game(s). I decided to try the jerk chicken tacos, as I had seen plenty rave reviews about these tasty treats. And I am very grateful to say that the reviews did not disappoint!    At first I did not think that I would like the tacos in a hard shell as that's not my thing...these were a definite exception.  The meat, the spices, the mango salsa, & Mexican slaw, along with the sauce they topped it with and the soft and hard shells marry together exquisitely.  I would definitely come back and get the jerk chicken tacos again. I also want to try the shrimp tacos. I did get to taste the turkey burger, but I did not care for it.  Hope this helps!",

    "text": "Very nice interior - comfortable and clean + extremely friendly and enthusiastic staff. I wanted to give Stone Mountain Grill a four, but the food did not wow me. The prices are fair for what you get but my cheeseburger fell flat. The meat wasn't as juicy or as nicely seasoned as I like. Toppings were too large and clunky and as such the burger kept falling apart. The bun was nicely toasted and flavors were fine, but it just didn't blow me away. When I go out for a burger I like to be wowed and I often am. I believe with a bit of investigation and extra effort Stone Mountain is not far off from improving this situation. The fries were nearly perfect in taste, but there were too few of them...my plate looked sad and only half dressed. My companions appeared to enjoy their food and it looked tasty to me, esp. the onion rings. I was glad that I did not order the shrimp salad that my friend ordered because there were only a few shrimp. I really do believe that with a few simple tweaks Stone Mountain could take this 3 score up to a 4...they're not too far off the mark, but they're not quite there yet.",

I love their fish dishes and their shrimp appetizer. If you love wine, try visiting on Wednesdays for 1/2 off bottles or glasses of wine. Hump Day Fun Day!  Finally, their outdoor patio can become enclosed in cold months and includes a fireplace and TVs. Great location for a small gathering/party/event. And...if you're staying in Ballantyne on business or pleasure, you can walk or Uber to your hotel",

I've been to events where Stone Mountain has catered, but when I ordered the same stuff in the restaurant it's completely inconsistent. I really want this place to be successful as they're conveniently located, but the quality is lacking and consistency is the key to keeping regulars. This location has turned over so often - I just want a superstar restaurant to stay put for awhile. Management, heed the feedback - pull it together.... We WANT a regular place and you have great staff that could do it!!!",

We sat out in their patio & had the set menu for 2. $50 for four course  dinner with choices. Great value. Nice ambiance relaxing vibe, lots of tvs. Staff were great & many people in restaurant. It was perfect for dinner. It beat getting in car to drive somewhere. Not often do you get a great place right beside a hotel. I would definitely recommend for anyone needing dinner. Servings huge. Food good.",

The meatloaf was dry and flavorless, the mac and cheese was not fresh and the blackened chicken pasta was ok but the actual chicken was rubbery.  The bourbon glazed salmon was also ok but the asparagus were hard and twiggy - you just could not bite through them.  We didn't complain nor did we send the food back.  If they couldn't tell by the amount of food left on our plates that we didn't like it.. Oh well.  We couldn't pay the check and get out of there fast enough.  I may go back and give it another shot.. Maybe I'll try the burger.  I usually dismiss a location after two tries.",

Yum-Fuckin- O!! Their Filet Kabob were tender and perfectly cooked and came topped with crumbled blue cheese on top of arugula salad with onions, mushrooms, and peppers. So good.
