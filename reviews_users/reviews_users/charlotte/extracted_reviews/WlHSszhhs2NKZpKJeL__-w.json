My kids loved their kids meals - budge and chicken tenders - and my wife and I thought the burgers were great! This is better than five guys in my opinion...no it's not the best burger place ever, but for the area, it's very good! ORDER THE CHILI CHEESE FRIES AND THE MILKSHAKES! (Caps for emphasis) The staff was super friendly. It's new, but the place is super clean and decorated really well. We will come back!",

(You also get your choice of sides which includes french fries,  homemade chips, chili cheese fries,  or just cheese fries or for something different fried macaroni and cheese) I chose the fresh cut french fries which are made in house. Now I know you're thinking just another burger joint but in this case you'd be wrong this burger is delicious fresh not frozen made to order right in front of you. The staff is very friendly very helpful and just overall pretty amazing I have to say wayback burger is one of the best burgers I've eaten in a really long time. Do yourself a favor and get there as soon as you can!",

It cooked up pretty quick but the bun was cold and falling apart. Maybe if the bun was toasted it might hold together better. The meat had no flavor and the slaw and chili were falling out the sides of the burger which helped cause the bun to fall apart. Won't go back when there are better and cheaper burgers down the road at Showmars.",

Both times there was a bit of a wait, but it's made to order so I didn't mind waiting since it was so fresh when it came to my table.

    "text": "First of all, I'm not giving this place 3 stars because it was bad.  But burgers are a dime-a-dozen, so you really have to stand out to get an exceptional rating from me.  Wayback Burgers does good burgers, but it definitely does not qualify as exceptional.  We ordered 2 Carolina Burgers ($4.99 each), one order of housemade chips to split ($2.69) and 2 fountain drinks ($1.99 each).  Our total check with tax was $18.02, which is about what you would pay at Wendy's or any other generic burger place, except we would have gotten 2 orders of fries for that price anywhere else.  The burger was ho-hum.  I appreciate their throwback to the past, but they need to also be future forward and at least offer the option of a gluten-free bun.  I mean, GF buns have a long shelf life in the freezer and you can always up-charge for them, so I'm always at a loss when a burger joint doesn't offer them.  And it's the main reason I won't go back.  I will say that their chips were out-of-this-world.  Perfectly cooked -- every single one of them was crispy.  But I won't drive to all the way to Matthews for a chip.",

I liked the burger, but found it too oily (greasy) for my taste. I'm guessing the excess oil was due to the four slices of cheese. So, for me, I don't think I'll order this burger next time. I will update my review after trying a different burger. I also appreciated the presentation. The old newspaper was a cool touch.",

Hubby's Buffalo chicken sandwich was horrible. It wasn't like a chicken breast, more like \"chicken crackling\" and drowned in Buffalo sauce and some other white sauce. No need for a repeat visit.",

    "text": "I was excited about a new burger spot in Matthews but was disappointed in the flavor and prices of wayback burger . The customer service was great, so I gave 1star just for that . I really felt like none of our burgers had a distinct flavor  . Definitely not worth the $30 we paid for, the fries deep fried in oil that came along with the order had no flavor beyond the grease we had to sprinkle too much salt and add more than ketchup .   I ordered the \"Philly\" an all beef two patty burger with mushrooms and sauteed onions , where were the mushrooms , and they definitely came from a can or jar :( . My daughter got the jalapeno burger , hmmmmmmmmmm same burger as mine with a few slices of jar jalapenos , double sad face ! The buns were your basic store bought buns , the bottled water was like being at a Panthers game , Jeez I could've purchased an entire pack from the supermarket . I really was hoping to give an outstanding review but when you have 2 other individuals not enjoying their bland burger patties with limited toppings , what can you do .",

Family friendly and in a nice part of town (downtown Matthews). My only gripe is that prices are way too high for the \"quality\" of food - i.e. you're paying high prices for regular burgers, nothing special in terms of ingredients ( ex. coleslaw, cheese, bacon, the usual ). To have a burger and side and drink will probably cost you $12-$13 which is more than I'd like to pay at a fast food restaurant.",

They were running a special BOGO double bacon burger with the purchase of a side an drink.  First seems the young man on the register was new an in training.  He had ask another guy about it an he was like yeah we have that. Alright lol we order our burgers an drinks an fries he says 20.00 I said thats BOGO mmm here was the catch it was buy a burger an get one you just had to buy a drink an side.  Than it was 16.00 okay better price. But when we asked questions about the food since it was our first time the new employee didnt know which when I used to work in eateries they let us try food so we would know.  He asked the other employee an being he was busy cooking he could barely answer us really!! Finally a mgr is what she looked like came out an seemed to know much more than these other 2 or should I say friendly:) The burgers were good an juicy just as we ordered but it was just a burger I wont drive all the way to matthews just to go here again.  Fries are not fresh just frozen dumped in the fryer they were good  If your in that area an want a burger try it , there are alot of new places in matthews to try :)",

Instead of waiting any longer, I eat the burger. It was ok at best but nothing to brag about.  Fries were lukewarm at best and considering the 18 minutes I waited, they should've been piping hot! At these prices, they may want to really step their game up. Enhance customer engagement,  suggestive sell and most of thank your guest for patronage of your product. I could've gone elsewhere and not only received better service, but it wouldn't have been a disappointment. I'll return just to give you another chance to redeem yourselves but YOU BETTER BE ON YOUR A GAME!!",

    "text": "My family and I were looking for a different burger place other than the staples we have been going to.  Unfortunately we tried Way Back Burgers.  We were really let down after being excited after seeing the pictures online.  Food was way to pricey for what you get, and we do not mind paying for quality food.  No cheddar cheese is available, only American, Swiss or Pepper Jack, that is just gross.  The burgers were overly greasy, more than your standard greasy spoon.  The bun was extremely soft, like it had been microwaved for about 2 minutes.  We got the chili cheese fries, which were just terrible and caused major indigestion.  The milkshake may have been the worst part.  We got a Jr size for 2.99, and the cup was about the same size of the small clear water cups you get at most places (we compared and they were very close).  The strawberry flavoring tasted like syrup.     The good: service was ok, and the place was clean.  The bad: everything else.  The ugly: no \"way back\" vintage decor or ambience, unless you count the weird posters of kids and Pac-Man.  The music was awful.  I thought the staff had chosen the pop music playing (feat. Miley Cyrus!), but after every few songs, the \"DJ\" proudly announced you were listening to Way Back Radio and then ran an ad.  Not very vintage.  Please stay away.  I recommend almost any other burger place, including most fast food places.  In the Matthews area, Fuddruckers or Moo-Yah are much, much better and the same price or cheaper for way better food.",
