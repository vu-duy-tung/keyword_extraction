    "text": "Worst Carrabba's I've ever been to. The first time we went the filet was more like a cheap sirloin and very tough. We went back a second time and decided to stick to their pasta and chicken dishes which were good. However, there was a very sick waitress on the floor who was sneezing and wiping her nose while delivering orders. That decided it, we resolved to never go back lest we get Typhoid Mary as our waitress and that resolve lasted for almost a year until I got a huge craving for their lasagne. So we go for the third time yesterday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all. We were seated with menus right away. Another table was seated right after us. A few minutes later two more tables were seated one after the other. That's three tables seated after us. All three had some sort of interaction with a server and two had even gotten drinks while no one had even come up to us to tell us it would be a few minutes, can we get you a drink, whatever. Nothing. When a server approached the third table for a drink order and still nothing was said to us that was the final straw. This location will never get our business again. We left and went to the Metro Diner right behind Carrabba's and made the best of a disappointing situation.",

Hearty but light, the soup and salad option was filling and delicious. The hot, crusty bread accompanying our meal was a perfect complement. The sausage and lentil soup was a little spicy but not overwhelmingly so. My companion had the minestrone which I could see was thick with vegetables. Our salads were crisp and fresh and portioned appropriately for lunchtime. Or waitress was very courteous and efficient. She checked back with us several times to refill our beverages. She also packed our leftovers and bagged them to take with us.  As we left we both complimented the host and e cel lent dining experience we'd enjoyed.",

I haven't eaten at this Carrabba's in quite a long time, but I will be returning sooner than later.

I was promptly served and checked on frequently. The manager made a personal visit to my table and asked specifically about the feature my husband was having for dinner. We left the restaurant with pleasant thoughts. Two days later I realized I misplaced my Louis Vuitton bag, a gift I got for Christmas. After searching for a day straight, I called Carrabbas as a last resort and of course it was there. It's great to go to place that is friendly, has great food, and has friendly honest employees.",

Two orders of chicken fingers for the kids, spaghetti for the side, Mezzaluna ravioli for me, and Chicken Arugula with spaghetti for the husband.  It was all really good - my older son can't wait to go back.  Patrick was our waiter and he was AWESOME..........haven't had such good service in years.  Will definitely be back another day.

This was her first time ever going to Carrabba's and like we do when going out to eat, she let her food allergies be known immediately. Our server Katy took note of my daughter's allergies and informed her manager. He then came over to our table, sat down and explained how they prepared food in the kitchen. This made my daughter and myself very happy! To add to our level of satisfaction, the kitchen manger came to our table and explained that our food was going to be delayed a very short moment because one of the servers may have touched my daughter's chicken with a utensil that was used to handle seafood. He explained that he instructed the cook to make a fresh entree for my daughter because of this mishap. We were beyond happy with the level of customer service at this Carrabba's restaurant! The level of attentiveness from the staff was unlike any other restaurant I've ever been to! Thank you so much to our server Katy and the management at Carrabba's on East Independence Drive! We will definitely be returning!!",

No problem . The manager comped the order but asked to leave a $20 tip for the hostess because it was not her fault. No problem there either. Got home and opened the containers. Wow! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe the food I got. Had the chicken Marsala with spaghetti and meat sauce . First off, the Marsala chicken was dry and virtually no sauce . The spaghetti was just that, no sauce and no meat, terrible! Called and spoke with the manager, Nick said he would send a $60 gift card to me for the bad food and he transferred me to someone else who assured me they would send a gift card out for the food. I understand I got credited to begin with and was appreciative about the gesture, problem is, the $20 that was spent, wasn't worth the food I received. So far no gift card. This place has great food and customer service. Just don't order take out! Again, Terrible.",

CHICKEN BRYAN was my pre-vegetarian go-to dish, and I still lust over it when I see someone else eating it.  I've had it a ton of times, and it's always incredibly dry, but they make up for it with the tasty marinade, the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes, and the delicious lemon butter sauce.  Ask for extra sauce; you'll want it!  I am happy to see a recent menu addition of chicken bryan pizza.   The spice mix served with the complimentary bread is amazing, and I appreciate that they are always accomodating of my request for butter with the bread (instead of oil).",

    "text": "I usually LOVE Carrabas, but this location won't be seeing me again anytime soon.   They were out of crayons and had a cocktail menu that was only 3 drinks deep. Sound like a good combo to you?  No crayons? No drinks? Don't they know what a mom needs?! :) I asked for a drink list. They stared at me confused and pointed to the 3 drinks.   Our server was most likely new. We were at a round table, yet he leaned over the entire front of me and my full plate to fill my husband's tea, placing his armpit neatly over my face. He didn't bring bread or silver wear until we asked. But he was nice, which IS important.   It's been about a year since I've been to a Carrabas. Not only have the names of some entrees changed, but so have the portion sizes. Down with size, up with price. Nice. My husband always enjoys paying $16 for a handful of pasta and pasty sauce.   I got the Caesar salad. Limp, room temperature, gross. Not typical of what I'm use to from this chain . Also, the spices they put on the plate with olive oil for the bread was super salty.   My youngest was offered broccoli but they came back to say they were out. It happens. The kids pizza was bordering burnt - 0.5/4 slices were eaten.   We ALWAYS get calamari. This time it was fried too long. I think we got the bottom of the bag because the pieces were tiny and extremely greasy. Shiny greasy. Grease.   You know that awesome lemon butter and pepper sauce they serve with the calamari? It was unrecognizable. Like a small bowl of yellowish brownish oil. Kinda looked like Papa John's new garlic crud (not the nice creamy one from the 90's), but still tasted ok.  More grease.   Anyway, when I am spending money that took me more than a day to earn, I really want my money's worth. Didn't happen. Won't give them another chance. I worked hard for that bill!   As always the bread was good. My Coke was good.   The tiramisu was super good. 2 stars good. I really want another piece.",

It was grey and looked so bad!  My boyfriend and I took a little taste and it was just as bad as it looked.  We sent it back and later the manager came over, after we insisted on speaking with him, and he said the oil was old so he had the cooks replace it.  He never apologized and just asked if we wanted to try it again, at which point we said no and to just take it off our bill.  Then when our salads came out, we had ordered the dressing on the side and that took over 20 minutes!  And that was us repeatedly asking for the salad dressing!!!  Then our entrees came out, still no salad dressing, and plates on the table from other appetizers earlier.  We had a chicken dish that was a little pink, but were afraid to return it at this point, as the incompetence in this place was just over the top and we were afraid of what they might do with it!  Then my son had ordered a steak medium rare, and that came out rare, still cold on the inside, again we didn't send it back.  My dish was the chicken parmesan, at least that was cooked (probably in the old oil) but was so thin and tasted so salty it was practically inedible.  Our waitress was absolutely horrible, not once apologizing for anything and she should have not brought out half of what she did to us in the condition that the food was in.  I used to waitress and am so polite and usually tip 20%, but tonight, I couldn't even do 10%.  So disgusted by this place and the management and staff!  Stay away and go somewhere else!  This place probably needs to be closed down I would say as no one seems to care and I wish I had read the reviews before going as everyone else has expressed the same horrible experience.  Disgusting!!!",

Yuck. :(   2 stars because the server was nice and nobody got E. coli or wound up in the hospital.",

    "text": "This was a seriously awful experience. Our waitress was the only good thing, but even her charm could not prevent us from walking out. For one, the restrooms were in deplorable condition. Only one stall was working and even then it was disgusting. You were better off using the restroom outside in a bush. The wait was ridiculous, and not just our table. There were several other tables that were waiting just as long for their food.... or drinks... or silverware. We saw a few tables being greeted with a manager complaining about the wait. When we sat for two hours with still no food, we requested the manager as well as we wanted to know what was going on and how much longer we should expect to wait. Had the manager come over then to tell us this, we probably would have stayed, but since we had to request the manager three separate times spanning twenty minutes, we were not as kind. Our waitress ran to him and told him the urgency, when he looked behind him I waved and motioned him to our table immediately. He did not assume responsibility for the kitchen mistake nor did he give us any time frame for us to expect our food. He could not and would not answer any of our questions. This was not done in quiet either, we expressed our concerns and the tables around hushed down to listen. We immediately left. We have dined here many times before and his inability to accept responsibility and offer any kind of customer service has left us speechless and unhappy with the restaurant for the first time in years. There is plenty more to write about but this should cover enough for anyone reading this review to choose a different restaurant. (Our waitress was great and worked very hard so if you are reading and remember us, we got you)",

She used one rag to wipe a table, then wipe seats, and then continue wiping another table. Sanitary??  I think not.   Cooks were wearing beanies, ballcaps, or nothing at all.  I understand this is a chain restaurant, but it is supposed to be an above average chain. I have been in waffle houses that were run in a more clean and professional manner!",

    "text": "Not really into chain Italian but my husband for some reason has a soft spot for this place so we ended up here on a Friday night. Let's just say the smell can make you about face as it smells like a pile of rotten cheese (it's fresh cheese I guess). I was sooo turned off by the smell that it took me about 15 minutes to regroup and look over the menu. Once I looked over the menu I did find a scallop and shrimp pasta dish in which I ordered, my daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo and my hubby the Chicken Bryan with green beans as the side and we all had salad before our meal. As we awaited the arrival of our dishes we indulged in an order of cheese sticks which were good just a little too greasy for my blood but of course my teenager LOVED THEM and all the GREASE.. We also enjoyed the bread with the olive oil and herbs YUM.  Shortly thereafter our food arrived and after saying grace we all dug in. Everyone looked extremely happy except ME, my pasta was on the lines of Raviolli O's in a can the taste was bland and the presentation just as bland. Our server was very involved and concerned with the look on my face after I dug in and asked if I was okay and I shared my thoughts. He brought back the menu and told us that we can keep the meal and I can order something else. We declined on keeping the dish as we all thought it sucked but I quickly said I'll have the Chicken Bryan with green beans like my hubby was having.  Can I say ISH on here? Well if so that dish was the ISH .. You can taste the grill on the chicken and the goat cheese was a perfect topper and the sauteed beans were just perfect as a compliment.. Other than the smell and the fact that someone swiped our 2015 in the parking lot I would say the meals we had were great.",

They had a free order of meatballs to go this day so I had the meatballs the next day.  I didn't care for them that much - too much garlic & seasoning.

Carrabba's has been our go to for delicious chicken soup, so we were excited to go. However, it didn't take long for our excitement to fizzle and quite frankly burn OUT. At 5:30 pm, there was a pretty hefty wait. The hostess claimed the computer system was down so she couldn't confirm how long the wait was - but it turned into over an hour. Why, you ask??? Not because it was truly a big crowd - we watched as tables sat dirty. (We counted more than 12 empty at any given point in time). When we sat down there were more people waiting AND there was over 10 tables cleared and ready but the hostess wouldn't seat them. There were many moments that people were gathered by the expo area doing nothing while tables sat. They were just chatting & having a good ol' time. The manager came to our table after we expressed concern to our waiter and we were met with defense - \"quality of service is more important\" and I'll be honest, our waiter was very kind and very apologetic, our service was hardly wow-worthy. The food was mediocre at best and it was a huge let down. We can say for certain that we will choose ANY OTHER Carrabba's over this one if we choose to go to this brand again. We watched so many people get angry and frustrated and many of us talked about the poor operations as we waited for our turn to be sat. Get it together folks - too many choices exist today. Choice is in the power of the customer these days -- mediocre simply wont do.",

I had the Chicken Bryan - excellent.   To any servers/waiters/waitresses:  This is only my opinion, but the service I get is just as important, if not more, than the food I've ordered.  I expect to be checked on every ten minutes or so, or even just eye contact from your perch/wait station.  Personally, every time I have look up, or ask for something again when I've already asked for it - your 20% tip decreases by a point.  I always start at 20% - giving you the benefit of the doubt.  You are in the service industry - if you treat every patron/table with the same attitude and greeting you get at  Rik-Phil-A, I guarantee your tip margin will increase.  Not having to ask for something b/c you the server anticipated it - I add points to the tip, which is why Natalie got a +22% tip.",

I was beyond disappointed. I've tried pasta dudes with the entree before & for me. It's just not the same with out the accompanying mashed potatoes. Daughter ordered hers with pasta, I decided to try the chicken Bryan sandwich with a side of marinated cucumber & tomato salad.  Calamari was SPOT on as always, but there is never enough of that fantastic marinara! Entrees come, I taste her pasta. It's ok, wasn't fond of the pancetta in it (or what looked like a pea or maybe a caper? In it).  Now if you LOVE chicken Bryan- the sandwich doesn't even come close. It's a tasty sandwich, and very enjoyable. But doesn't have the same taste as the original fish. Very very THIN piece of chicken too! The cucumber tomato salad is a nice light side dish & not heavily coated with dressing.  Nice gentleman comes by to check on us (of course while I have food in my mouth, lol). I try to clear my mouth & swallow in order to say how disappointed I was that my original choice of fish wasn't available. He quickly remedied that as they finally had potatoes ready. And brought my my favorite chicken Bryan with mashed potatoes. I left very very happy & satisfied!  Craving fulfilled!   Our server was very patient & helpful as well. Thanks for everything!",

After 20 minutes another family of 3 walked in, they asked them if they wanted a table or booth, and then sat them immediately. When I asked what was going on, they said they didn't have anyone on the list. We were the only people sitting in the waiting area. What did they think we were there for?! They claimed they had had some problems with confusing pagers and just must've missed us.   So they say they're sorry and seat us at a small booth in the bar. The table was small and leaning. No asking what preference of table. As we sat there another 5 minutes with no one saying another word to us, we decided to leave. As we walked out, we said we decided to just leave, they simply said \"ok\".   I don't understand that kind of customer service in a restaurant like that. So incredibly disappointed.

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in the area! However I was slightly disappointed today. I went in with my daughter, her friend and my friend for a quick late lunch. It was busy but not overwhelming. We were seated right away when we walked in but it took over 10 minutes wait to even get our drink order.   When our server greeted us it was a very rushed greeting. Which I completely understand when you are running more than one table to be a bit hurried. However, when u work in the restaurant industry, customer service is a must! Having experience in the serving life, I never cheat a server out of their tip unless the service was un-salvageable. With that being said, I can attest she was efficient in serving us and having our food delivered promptly and still hot, as well we never had to ask for refills which is always great!   I order my fav appetizer, Calamari. I love Carraba's calamari but today I think they undercooked the seafood. It was chewy and \"juicy\". Not oily but like the calamari wasn't properly dried before coating it with the breading and frying it. I tried to pick at the more cooked calamari but soon gave up.   My lentil and sausage soup was delicious and spicy which uplifted my spirits from the calamari ordeal.   My entree was too very tasty and filling. I am a slow eater and I love to enjoy my food. Towards the end of our meal I was the only one left with a plate in front of her but soon felt rushed once again to pack what I was still eating and pay my bill.   Overall I enjoyed most of the meal but the customer service can step it up a bit. I don't care for too much interaction but I definitely don't like to feel rushed to eat a meal I'm trying to enjoy.",

The manager came out, apologized and made sure the replacement was done right. That's what I would expect, and with the right manager working it's what will happen. Last night we sat down and ordered, the food took about an hour and fifteen minutes to come out and was a mix of cold and burned. They burned meatballs people. Chicken was burned, pasta was cold on one plate and steaming on the next plate. We heard endless apologies from the server but never saw a manager. I'm to the point of almost asking which manager is working before I order a meal here.",

It's admitted that call-ahead service does not guaranteed you will have a place to sit at any specific time and as well, the manager of this location chided his staff for not knowing how to seat people whom used call-ahead seating. Outside from that on the most part, the restaurant staff seemed a bit disorganized as the manager was asked to be spoken to by several different families/tables during our visit, I kind of felt bad for the gentleman.",

Waited 40 for our soup and we find out they are out of soup. The people at the next table had to get styrofoam cups because they are out of glasses. This is NewYears Eve people!!! Poor management !!! Don't go here! Now they are out of bags",

I ordered the Chicken Marsala with Linguini and it came with a huge \"cup\" of Lentil soup with Sausage.  Everything was   yummy.  The service was wonderful and they have a very comfortable and service oriented approach to customer service.    Now if all that wasn't enough, I was sent home with a portion of fresh Lasagna, fresh bread  and dipping oil.  Now being a Sicilian girl from NY I could have looked for something to complain about in an Italian chain restaurant, but I simply couldn't find anything to whine about.  Thanks all!  Great job!!

It was always packed but we could do call ahead seating which was nice. However, lately the service has been bad, food okay, and not very crowded, which should have been a warning sign!  We had a bad experience about a month ago, but the manager was great, covered our meal and gave us a gift card so hopefully we would come back. We did, and it was pretty much the same. Hostess was rude, Waited forever to even get a waiter over to take our drink order, and waited forever for a side of pomidoro sauce. This is basically marinara but better, and given how many dishes have this- this should be on hand ready at all times by the kitchen staff. I don't blame our waiter entirely. They seemed understaffed and turnover high given that manager from the previous time left! Not sure we will be back- but hopefully they can get their act together!",

    "text": "Today, Sunday, June 17 was by far my worst restaurant experience in a long time. This restaurant used to be my go to Italian food. Arrived and was told a 25 to 35 minute wait- no problem had drinks at the bar. After we were seated we were informed by our stressed out waitress that approximately 1/3 of the menu items were no longer available for tonight because of kitchen issues. And that our wait time for entrees would be 35 to 45 minutes wait time. After two hours and 10 minutes our food arrived and was by far the worst Italian food I've had in quite a while. Cold pasta, burnt chicken over cooked steaks. Will not return and can no longer recommend this restaurant. Suggestions to management -Inform the gas at check-in and that there is issues and wait time for food would be greatly extended. By informing your gas of issues I guess us the option of leaving  On Monday, June 18, the new manager/owner, Nick Z called to apologize for the poor experience. He reassured me that they were working on restoring service and the food quality in the near future. Suggested that He will have things back to normal in six months and to  Ok 11 months later- May 26,2019 6:20pm Return to this same restaurant to try one more time. I did  receive a call from the manager at that time in June  apologizing and to give them another try in six months so they can fix issues. Well, this visit was worse - waited 10 minutes for a table which is very quick although the restaurant was 40% full. Our waiter was very nice and polite and took our order promptly. No one informed us that they lacked half the cooking staff and that it would be a hour to hour and 35 minutes before we would receive our food. Please management informed the hostess of any issues so that the customers will know and we can make a decision on whether not we want to stay or leave. Don't be afraid, tell us the truth.  We never received our food and we left. Our waiter was very polite and apologize several times as well as management on duty .  It is such a shame because Carrabba's used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area. Keep in mind that each restaurant is independently managed and the other locations are good.  Good luck to this location and to Carrabba's in rebuilding your reputation.",

This was my go to pasta every time I came here, I would eat the whole thing in one sitting because it was THAT good. This time it took four times of heating it up within 2 days and my husband tried eating it as well. And over half is still left.

At that point our daughter was hangry which is never good.  When her spaghetti and meatballs arrived a full hour after we were initially served, we figured our food was next.  It took another 15 minutes for it to arrive and by then we were over it.  I spoke to the manager who tired to explain away the kids meal coming way before the adults.  That made zero sense.  She did adjust the bill.  Overall, a terrible experience for Father's Day.  We won't be back.",

The waitress finally got the manager involved and got it out quickly and comped the bill (we didn't ask for that), so we decided to give it another try.   The second time was much of the same. It took the server 25 minutes to take our orders and another hour to get the meal. The restaurant was only half full, so it wasn't like it was busy.   As far as the food goes, it was hit and miss both times. One entree was so over cooked and burned that I am surprised it made it out of the kitchen. The other entree was fantastic though.  We won't be back. The food is overpriced for what it is, hit and miss, and takes forever to get to you.

Our server was polite and friendly. When we told him that we were in a bit of a hurry because we had movie tickets, he was prompt with the bill and the payment.  Our food came out in a timely manner. My wife got Veal Marsala and I ordered the swordfish steak. Both entrees were served hot and were delicious. The swordfish was cooked perfectly. We are on weight watchers so we both made a special request for steamed broccoli as our side (without the usual butter/oils, which adds 160 cal.) and were happy they were able to accommodate our request. Not all restaurants will do this.  We look forward to returning here.",

One of us is only a toddler. Now we are sitting at a table for 8. Now my son will be falling asleep or extremely cranky. They should have told us they would be seat nazis. Lots of empty tables around us. What is happening here?  As an update... When we left there were at least 8 empty tables behind us.

I had the Chicken Serrantino (the small order was about $13 dollars) and it was one piece of chicken with eggplant on top and cheese and delish sauce (tasted like the marsala sauce to my buds) - YUM!  I picked the mashed potato side - it was a large helping and I couldnt even finish it!  I have also had other chicken dishes here and all are wonderful.  The waitress provided dough for our 6-yr-old dinner companion to play with and eat while we were waiting.  Very nice!  They brought her food out first which was awesome.  The entire meal was so quick and efficient it is the perfect place for kids!  Love it!",

    "text": "A couple of days ago my mom and I were there to have a lunch. We were sat down at a booth close to the kitchen, and we were greeted by Paisely. She took our drink order and then Tyler delivered our drinks to us. He explained that Paisley was in the middle of shift change and that he would be our waiter. Okay that's cool. He was way better than Paisley anyway. While I was facing the kitchen area, mom was facing the dining area. 1) We both noticed Paisley was not on shift change. 2) She was constantly on her cell phone. 3) The patrons a few tables away from us apparently gave her a $7 tip, which I would love to be tipped $7.00. Paisley ran up to her co-worker and actually complained about it. How ungrateful! 4) She was very chatty Kathy with the co-worker she complained about the $7 tip to. Actually, she barely even worked after her \"shift change\". Mom and I don't eat at Carrabba's very often, but we've never experienced anything like that before. I hope the next time I come back in that Paisley won't be my waitress. As a manager myself, I wouldn't let my employees present themselves like that in front of patrons.",

Food was dry and over cooked explained that to the server and the management team and no one seemed to care. I got a to-go order for my wife at home and the order came out wrong. Also the server asked four different times how to split the bill after 15 mins of waiting I went to the manager and asked what the hold up was with no explanation. Then after they took my card it took a additional 15 mins to get my card back. We have never had such terrible experience at Carrabbas. We come there constantly for dinner family functions and special events. We travel from Monroe pass other establishments because normally the service food and atmosphere are top notch. Talking with servers and other employees it seems to happen a lot lately. I'm just concerned that if I return I will have a similar experience. Thank you for taking the time to read this email and I hope you have a great day.",

We got the 'full' size and had enough for a whole lunch the next day.  Server, Amad, was great and very attentive without being a hoverer. If I want someone to hover over me, I will call my great aunt Millie.   Made a good suggestion on the larger plate of fried zuchini, it was exactly right for us to share as an appetizer. The dipping sauce that comes with it is PERFECT! It would also be very good with a squeeze of lemon and used on calamari.   I was about ready to make it a 5 star...but being charged 2.50 for a glass of iced tea in the south just rubs me the wrong way. That one charge on our 68$ bill was what rankled me. Even 1.99 I can live with, 2.50 is excessive, IMO. It is plain tea for crying out loud.   Otherwise, it is great!",

    "text": "... and I'm being generous.  Since my last experience at Fontanella sucked, I decided to give this place another chance. I had to skip both breakfast and lunch so I went ridiculously early: 6:30  and the place was packed, there was one sit left at the bar which I grabbed.   I decided to keep it modest this time and ordered the signature pasta w/ soup. Totally unlike the salad option, the Sicilian sausage and lentil soup was very tasty - it probably didn't hurt that I hadn't eaten anything at all in the past 24 hrs.   The Penne Franco was a little gimmicky but overall it was pretty good, I'm a sucker for garlic. I order the  $11,50 plain version, I'm not a fan of throwing chicken on top of pastas or salads.  I had a cup of the house Montelpucciano, which was very average but reasonable @ $5.50  A solid three stars so far.   At this point I must have been woozy because I ordered a Tiramisu. Seven dollars and change for the worst imitation of Tiramisu I've ever had. As tasteless as day-glow colored supermarket cakes. To boot it costs 70% as much as the pasta and soup dinner itself.  Second experience at this restaurant confirms it's ok for the basics but don't be suckered into paying for a fine dining experience because you won't be getting your money's worth.",

    "text": "I really like this location. I've never had to wait very long no matter what time I've showed up. The staff is so friendly;  walking to our table we are greeted with \"how are you?\" \"Enjoy your meal\" I really appreciate that. The servers are usually enthusiastic, prompt, amd professional. I've never had a problem with the food. My favorite dish here is the Mezzaluna...so delicious.  The chicken parm with the garlic potatoes also always hits the spot. If there is room, I love to end my meal with the chocolate dream cake...never had anything so \"dreamy.\" And of course on the way out we are wished a good night from the staff we pass. I always have an enjoyable experience here.",

He is truly one of the best servers I have ever had at any restaurant. The food was nice and delicious, and although it was extremely busy we got everything in a timely manner, and never needed for a refill.",

    "text": "I've heard people speak highly of Carabba's so My family decided to check it out by having lunch at the Matthews NC location. It turned out to be an awful experience - so bad that we're not interested in discovering whether it was only this location that is so poorly run. We won't be visiting another Carabba's.   First thing that struck me was the dark and dim interior of the restaurant.  This lighting might be appropriate for the dinner service - though I would still find it too dark - but it was totally inappropriate for lunch.   Second issue was the table at which we were seated. Before we even sat down I could see that it hadn't been cleaned properly. The hostess was apologetic but unfortunately the tone had been set. The fly that buzzed our table throughout the meal complemented this tone perfectly. (The bad lighting might be intentional after all.)  Next up was the service - the attitude of the server could charitably be called indifferent. When she did bother to address us she was barely intelligible. She also got our order wrong.   Two other issues also contributed to our bad experience. The deep fryer was broken, or at least that's what we thought our server said - anyway, we couldn't get the fried calamari. Next, the soap dispenser in the ladies room was broken, and it looked like it had been broken for some time. I wonder how the female staff wash their hands before returning to work?  Last but certainly not least was the food. I find it amazing that anyone, no matter how unfamiliar they might be with properly prepared Italian food (or any food for that matter), could praise what is passed off as food at this restaurant. The salads were limp and had just been thrown on the plate, the pasta was way over cooked, the sausage tasted awful, and the lasagna looked and tasted like it had been made by a two year old. A not particularly gifted two year old. We were totally disgusted.   It may well be that this location is a bad apple in the Carabba's barrel. Certainly some of the issues we experienced could be attributed to incompetent and/or ignorant management. But we won't be finding out - this bad apple was enough to make us avoid Carabba's from now on.",

I usually steer clear of chain restaurants, but not everyone loves local food. Carabba's has good solid service, decent food, and decent wine. It's a tad salty for my taste, but it won't keep me from returning with our 'out of towners' who trust the brand and love the product!",

It was really busy for a Monday night surprisingly, and the wait time was like 40 minutes for a party of 2. Next time we want to come, we'll make a reservation.  The food is good though, and so is the waiter service. The hostess was rude the last time we came in. I would go back.",

    "text": "I used to just love this place but last night it was so lack luster food wise. I ordered the Linguine with Lump Crab in it and it was just boring. There was no salt and even though the spinach and tomatoes seemed fresh the mushrooms didn't at all. It seemed like there were fresh and canned items. Also, there was barely any seafood in my dish. I love linguine and vegetables but seriously it's a seafood dish and it should have a ton!  My partner had the Mezzaluna Ravioli with barely any sauce when he asked for more sauce it took the waiter forever. When he did bring it dinner was over. Bear stated that dinner was a meh at best and the manager came over and chatted with us but the conversation wasn't about how can we make your experience better, it was please try us next time. He did comp Bear's meal.  Carrabbas went from one of my top chains to go to why bother anymore. And I would like to retract my earlier 4 stars but I won't. I'd rather show any update to that experience. So that you may now how far they have fallen.",
