Not only is the food perfect, the vibe is awesome. I'm not sure how they do it, but Chipolte makes me feel glad to be alive. Maybe it's the unfinished wood, the music, or employees who actually seem happy.  I experienced a hiccup when I ordered over the phone, however. I was rushing to work and wanted to pick up some Chipotle. The food wasn't ready when I arrived 15 minutes later. They wanted to make it on the spot, but I didn't have time to wait. They made it up to me by providing a free bowl another day after I called to ask what happened.",

I am anxiously awaiting a Chipotle restaurant in  the Northern part of Charlotte.  They just have not made it up this far as yet.  So, when I am near downtown or in South Charlotte, I am always up to eat at Chipotle.  Umm Umm good! It's like Salsarita's only better!",

    "text": "I have been a Chipotle fan since the good ol' days when there were only two Chipotles and they were both in Denver. Amen. I smuggled their bulging burritos in my carry-on on long flights between DIA and Logan in between semesters... But I digress. And I'm dating myself. Alas, I am thankful that the chained-up version of Chipotle is strikingly similar to the original. Truly. And while it could have gone el-cheapo and sourced questionable ingredients from more questionable sources, their business model is founded on securing the freshest ingredients possible - and getting meats raised humanely without antibiotics and hormones. Word. That being said, I still order vegetarian, but this is the one fast-food place I will take my kiddos.   Chipotle is very kid friendly, perfect for a quick snack, or a big dinner. It is great as an eat-in meal or takeout in a large brown paper bag. If you are pressed for time, order online. This spot has five prime parking spots right by the front door for online or fax orders. This location is busy, but I never seem to stand in line for too long and my meal(s) are prepared super quick.   My personal favorite ... vegetarian burrito bowl made with brown cilantro lime rice, black beans and fajita veggies, mild salsa, medium corn salsa, and a little bit of spicy hot salsa, shredded cheese, lettuce, and, of course, guacamole. Delicious. It takes me two meals to finish it. Portions are huge! Bonus for me ... easy to order gluten-free for me and my girls. The boys and hubs can get a burrito as big as their heads and we all are happy campers. Well fed, happy campers.",

Line was 8 deep. It took 16 minutes to get up to the front. I was in a hurry so I was watching the time. The guy in front of me ordered a burrito. The server gave him a little more than a teaspoon of rice. Fair serving of beans. When he asked for chicken, she scraped and scraped an essentially empty pan and gave him an embarrassing amount. That was the tipping point and I walked out. Come on Chipotle. I need you.",

Situated next to Vitamin World is this new Chipotle. The resto is chock full of clean and shiny tables, smiley employees and swift service. The offerings are typical of other Chipotles - burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, fountain beverages, etc. Yes, they charge for guacamole like all the other Chipotles. But hey, they do say that their focus is on \"food with integrity,\" and that's pretty cool for a fast-ish food chain.   The side patio is nice to grab a seat and take in some fresh area while you mow down your burrito of choice. There aren't any sweet views from the patio, but hey, outside is outside in CLT.",

    "text": "I was SO excited about this location opening up so close to where I live, as I practically grew up on Chipotle (starting back in 2000 in San Diego). My first opportunity, I made an order online and picked-up on my way to class. However, I was a little let down.  First, my online order was not ready at the designated time, despite it not being busy. Someone just dropped the ball. Oh well, slightly annoying, but forgivable as there was no one else in line and I could oversee the construction of my bowl.  The fajita mix (peppers and onions) looked a little old and over-cooked. It happens sometimes and I figured that I just got there after a lull. No biggie.   When it came time to leave, there was confusion about how to use the system, as it was a pre-paid online order. It took about a minute to clear up, but was thinking that for a brand-new location the staff should be better trained. Still, I calmed myself and ran through my imaginative happy place where Chipotle guacamole runs in rivers and their salty-lemony chips grow on trees.  However, the the final let down arrived when I started eating the barbacoa bowl. The barbacoa was rather dry and clumped together--immune to even repeated stabbings and twistings with a fork. Nothing could de-tangle it. I had to eat it more like meat on a stick style, which was actually a  little bit of a turn off and made for a unsatisfied Chipotle experience.  Put together, I was let down. I was expecting more for a brand new location. Perhaps the staff needs more time to get into the groove of things and maybe Chipotle should step up their training program a bit too.  I'll be back again soon to see how things have progressed, but please don't let me down again! My heart (and stomach) just couldn't handle it.",

I am not sure if it was the organicness or some sort of organic placebo effect but I did not feel nasty full. The burrito also tasted much fresher than the other two burrito chains mentioned.

For me, its the steak that makes the difference taste-wise.  Their steak is very juicy and succulent, and has almost a smokey/grilled flavor it to it.     Their service is usually pretty good.  Although I feel the employees sometimes go too far out of their way to speak and/or joke with you - which I don't mind, but sometimes its excessive.  Otherwise the service is good and they are more than willing to accommodate whatever your specific burrito needs are.  There is usually ample parking and easy access from whichever entrance you choose (that's what she said ;-)).  The inside, though sometimes crowded, is usually clean enough to stay and eat, if you like.    Friends tell me the bowls and salads are good as well, but I am yet to try either.  I always run the burrito - steak, peppers and onions, plenty of cheese, sour cream and guac, with hot salsa -  NOW that's good eating folks!

    "text": "In an effort to start eating healthier, we opted to go to Chipotle today to satisfy our craving for a burrito.  First of all, they have an iPhone app you can order directly off of,  with their full menu -  toppings & chips & drink offerings. You can choose to pay on the app or pay inside the restaruant. Already I was a happy girl!  They gave us a 20 minute pickup time.  When we arrived, people started piling in.  Lucky enough, they have two spaces reserved for iPhone, online & fax orders. Another plus!  When my boyfriend went inside at 1:15 PM, they were finishing up our order, he paid & came right back out. Yes, another plus!  When we got home (about a 15 minute drive), our burritos were still hot inside the foil Yum! My chicken burrito with fajita mix and tomatillo green salsa was delicious. The chicken was seasoned just right & the fajita vegetables season was spicy. And the chips...crisp & flavorful, with the lime & salt. The guacamole was fresh & not mushy.   Other notes: Not a huge place, but they do have a nice patio area with ample seating. Boyfriend said the employees were nice & the inside was clean. The prices do seem a bit high.  The biggest plus of all: eating the burrito & half the bag of chips, I didn't feel fat & yucky!",

Line starts on the left instead of right and the inside still has the industrial feel.  The tables are laid out with high counter stools and a couple of regular height tables.  Patio area is pretty killer.  Good place to do some people watching.  Staff is super nice... You could kind of tell they are still training but no huge mistakes.  Everything is clean and makes for a solid, predictable experience every time.",

    "text": "I am on a roll here.  Two Chipotles in 2 weeks.  I am glad to see there's another faster type of food in this area of town.  There aren't may other options especially if you wanted something that is fairly healthy.  Getting into the parking lot can be a challenge. If you are coming from CPCC, you either have to make a left onto 3rd street and then turn right on Charlottetowne Ave or go up to Charlotttetown Ave and make a u-turn which can be challenging but unlike some other Chipotles, there is plenty of parking.  It shares its parking lot with a Vitamin World and a mattress store.   Inside the restaurant, they have bar tables but like any chipotle I've been in, I find their restaurants to be sterile with no real character.  But I guess most people come here for the food.  I am really starting to appreciate Chipotles food.  This time I opted for a burrito bowl with chicken, sans rice and added guac, and a couple different types of salsa.  Got it to go as I was in a hurry to get home.  Great flavors.  I really enjoy their hot salsa.  Service was good here.  People were friendly.  They do not have liquor yet but there is a sign saying liquor license is pending.  Overall a good experience...i just don't care for the sterile restaurant seating area. So that's why they get a 3.",

I don't know if I've ever strayed from my ultimate topping combo... pico de gallo (the chopped tomato mild sauce), a little hot sauce, corn, sour cream, and cheese.  Can you say PERFECT?!!  The guacamole also rocks, although it costs extra.  I also throw in the sauteed peppers/onions when I do the bowl.  You can't go wrong...chipotle heaven.  As far as service, always friendly considering how busy this place can get.  The line can literally be to the door during peak hours.  The price you pay for heaven I guess.  However, they always seem well staffed and the line moves faster than you would think possible.  And last, but certainly not least.  Patron margaritas?!  This must be a recent addition because I only noticed the sign today.  Nothing like a cold margarita (or beer) to go with my burrito...   Keep up the good work!!",

Nothing but great things to say about the staff at this joint, the always stellar burrito, burrito bowl, salad, and anything with copious amount of guac. Never a complaint to be found from this side when it comes to the menu.   I will, however, say that the access for this location is simply atrocious. Good luck gaining entrance into the pygmy-style parking lot they have going on here....ever. Unless you're coming from Elizabeth on Charlottetowne or from Dilworth/Myers Park on Kings, you're screwed. Only two entrances to be found. Take your pick, do a U-turn if need be, THEN commence enjoyment.",

Sometimes my bowl is overflowing and then days like today I received half a scoop of rice, half a scoop of chicken, I had to ask for more salsa and cheese. And on top of it the girl tried to give me a side of guac that was half full. I then asked her to fill up the side cup of guac and was given attitude. When my bowl is half filled do I get to pay half price? I think you guys need a better training program for your employees so that people are getting the same portion sizes all the time. I have also been in here many times when they are out of chips, or cheese, or guac, or veggies at the end of the night and don't replace anything in the last hour or so.",

You can easily walk, in less than 3 minutes, to Target, Best Buy, Trader Joe's, Vitamin Shoppe, and many more places.  The food at Chipotle is always great and the service is always top rate.  Although I will say that I went in to eat a few weeks ago and the manager was doing business paperwork on the tables in the dining room area.  Not a great place to conduct managerial duties of paperwork completion.   Especially when you are taking up valuable real estate in the dining room!!    So, they do no have queso here because it is processed.  It would be great to find a queso that is able to be manufactured without harsh stabilizing chemicals, but this certainly doesn't take away from the fantastic menu options currently available.    The outside patio area is great for dogs and people alike.  There are select tables with umbrellas, so arrive prior to busy hour to reserve your shaded table.     There is a mattress store beside of Chipotle, so if you eat too much then you can go \"test mattresses\" in a nicely cooled and comfortable mattress store!  Ha!!    Enjoy your experience!",

A couple days ago, some friends said they went to this location and that they were out of a lot of toppings. I was doubtful, but it made me crave it again, so I stopped in today. I ordered a bowl and wanted guac. In fact, I like guac because it helps balance out the heat in some of the other ingredients. However, I was told it would be FIFTEEN minutes before there'd be more guac. FIFTEEN. Like, toss me the avocados. I'll smash em up for you.",

The more I have visited Chipotle over the years the more I realize how lazy they have gotten with their one-item menu. There meat and salsa have become so bland you're almost better cooking your own at home with some marinade.  Many competitors have popped up over the years that are not Mexican food joints but direct \"burrito only\" type competitors and have given Chopotle a run for their money. While I don't see them going out of business any time soon, they sure need to get their act together. With the recent reveal of almost an entire GMO menu, I have one more reason besides flavor to never return.  Goodbye Chipotle, for good.",

Line for lunch and or dinner can be wrapped around the seating area and sometimes nearly out the door. Limited seating area but there's normally always a spot to sit. I'm not really big on the cleaning habits I've seen on several occasions tables left dirty and no one paying much attention to the matter. The bathroooms are acceptable but could use a deep cleaning. Staff is not too friendly but if I served burritos to half of uptown traffic everyday I probably would feel a little annoyed sometimes too! Overall you can't go wrong with a chipotle bowl or burrito. Great grab and go option or night out eating with the family. Casual dining experience for sure.",

I ordered a salad with chicken and fajitas, at first I was barely given a scoop of chicken and when I said something he just looked at me and scooped another half scoop.  The fajitas where at the very end and he did ask for them multiple times while I was in line but the girl he was speaking to just ignored him, then when she finally came over was just like \"um didn't think you were really out\" When I got to the register I wanted to use my birthday chips and guac, the cashier was like I don't know, and I said well I scan it here and she was just like sure. I asked did it go through she said I guess. I said before I hand you my card I want to be sure and she said \"it looks like it\". I pay and she pushes my bag to me. I leave just to get in my car and drive off to see she didn't put my guac in the bag. Went back in it was just sitting on the counter, as I walk up she just hands it to me and gives me a stale look. Won't be back at this location.",

The store was not busy at all And all personnel appeared to be annoyed by every guest in the restaurant.   For the record we arrived more than 2 hours before closing. We both order bowls, but the workers seemed To annoyed by our topping requests. Aren't we able to pick what toppings we want.   Neither of us were on our phones or engaging with one Another. We wanted to make sure that we were fully engaged with the staff.  I asked the cashier for chips, she replied \"we ain't got none\". Remember it's 2 hours before closing. I said o okay. Then she stares at me. I had to ask what was the total or she was going to stare at me forever.  She mumbles the total under her breath. At this point we grab our stuff and go. We were so dissatisfied with the service, i don't think we will return to this location.  I recommend to anyone if you want enjoy your food Options in peace do not eat here",

Wtf am I supposed to do with a dry ass salad and this isn't the first time this has happened which is why I now ask BEFORE the salad is made If there is any.   Also, the fajitas that was given to me was scraped and burnt when I should have been given fresh fajitas. I wasn't even given a full serving. I also wasn't given a full serving of the lettuce (which was the lettuce that typically goes on top & that lettuce had to be used because they had ran out), along with the stingy 1/3 of a scoop of guac I received.

Though it is not badly situated, they are not easy to spot, and the entrance is tucked in so that you see them from the parking lot and not from the road. Makes perfect sense if you're parking, but if you're passing on the road you can easily zip by without any idea that they are even there. I have to keep that in mind.  Regardless, it's a decent spot to pop into for a bite, especially for lunch, provided you get there at the right time. 11:30? Generally good. 11:35? Prepare to wait. Seriously. I walked in one day and literally walked right up to the register. By the time I was paying for my order - which took a minute longer than perhaps it should since I was behind a DoorDash/Uber Eats/whatever pickup - the line went all the way back to the door. Guess that maybe I'm the only one who can't figure out that they are there.  Regardless, it's a nice spot if you hit it right, and you can sit there and watch the folks who get there at the wrong time, or take your order to go and eat it later (or just order and let that DoorDash guy do the work.",

The fact that it has stuck around is a testament to it's commitment to high-quality, natural ingredients prepared in-house.  The location of this Chipotle is incredibly convenient. Since parking can be an issue, Chipolte has designated certain spots for carry-out orders, which I suspect makes up a large portion of their business.  My main issue with Chipotle is the price, which I believe is excessive, especially when it comes to guacamole. Guacamole should be included in the price of the item, not an additional added cost.  Chipotle can be quick and healthy, and in this world of McDonald's and Burger King that must be supported.",

Strangely enough I think there was font  as a team was impressive.  They had each other's back  and firmly took  the opinion that  nothing could be done about the service and wait time, and that my demands were irrational. I can appreciate that sort of corporate loyalty  and franchise  dishonesty . It's something you can train for.  \"if any customers complain about the wait time or food be sure to form ranks support each other.\"  I took a good friend out for what we thought was going to be a quick bite and catch up. She has kids, busy schedule, a demanding profession and the very least we expect is courteous respectful service. We both have agendas they keep us traveling and making appointments. Up until now Chipotle has always been a consistent restaurant choice for our busy lives.

She was very nice and apologized for the terrible customer service at the Kings drive location.   The kings drive location was so unprofessional, slow and of course very unreliable.

Its an embarrassment and inconvenience when your catering for important meeting and then the food ruins the vibe before the meeting even started. Kings drive Chipotle - bad business!

There is no more slow moving lines with uninterested employees talking and not paying attention.   This chipotle is now more fitting of what I expect based on experience with other locations. The only thing I think still needs work is keeping up with the demand. There are still times where things like veggies are unavailable because more have not been made until they are completely out. Fixing that and making more in anticipation of the rush would give them that final star from me.   But all around I am much more pleased than any of my past experiences with this location.",
