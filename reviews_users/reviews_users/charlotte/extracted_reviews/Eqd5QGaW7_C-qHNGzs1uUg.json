I like mine with kalamata olives and goat cheese added and they gladly accommodate. I am a beer nerd so a place's beer selection plays a huge roll on whether I go there or not. They have a good draft selection and always have several of my favorite beers on tap. The only reason I do not give them five stars is because they can have better rotational drafts and more porters and stouts in the winter months.",

I get the barbecue chicken pizza, and it's pretty good, although I wish they would lay off on all of the cheese--it feels like I'm just eating a heart attack. The Brixx Salad is pretty good, too. The lunch special, as another review mentioned, is a great deal if you go to lunch. Overall, pizza is good, service is good, prices are good, and location is exceptional. I'll definitely return when I'm in the mood for food at Blakeney.",

The staff are great, very down to earth and the kind of people you enjoy getting to know and shooting the shit with at the bar.   Mondays and Thursdays are beer special nights, so of course I would recommend this to those both inclined towards tasty brews and pinching pennies.   The pizzas and pastas are delish-- among my favorites pizzas, the prosciutto and pineapple Hawaiian is the best.   This particular location of Brixx is convenient for those living in South Charlotte and the Ballantyne area, as well as those in Weddington, Marvin, and Waxhaw.   The atmosphere is very chill-- dim lighting without being overly dramatic, and plenty of TVs posted up for everyone interested in watching the football or basketball game. Dress is is very casual. The evening crowd differs greatly in my experience than the day time crowd; the latter usually attracts families and children whereas the evening crowd is college age and up.   Brixx is awesome, especially this location! Check it out! Especially Monday evenings for the 2 buck pint night of delicious beer on tap!",

I went a few times and tried a few things, all of which are forgettable except for the creamy balsamic dressing (excellent) and the $1.95 domestic drafts every Monday night. Even with the special, it's hard to choose a beer that isn't boring - they go through their beer so slowly, you can tell that they don't clean their beer lines and the lineup rarely changes. I've tried the mexican pizza (B-), the mushroom wrap (C), and the buffalo chicken pizza (D-, and double negative for getting my order of no gorgonzola wrong not once but twice)  The portions are ok, the service is hit and miss, the patio seating outside is nice - basically, I'd spend my money at a million other places before wasting it here.",

They use a real light sauce and they don't bury it in cheese like most of the more commercial Hut-type stores.  This location is nice and clean and always looks presentable.

The lettuce was dried out and wilted and serving as a \"garnish\" - the app plate was sitting there and she came back to ask if we wanted our drinks to go (but we hadn't gotten our meals yet)?! Meals came and they were just OK. Nothing to write home about and definitely not worth a $48.00 check. We had a coupon for a free app (thankfully the wilted lettuce wasn't something we had to pay for) - so she took the app off but reminded us (in writing) at least 3x that the original bill was more (maybe so we'd tip appropriately?) - we did, we certainly don't blame her for all that was mediocre at Brixx, but we won't be back. Just easier to find other establishments with fresher stuff and more attentive service. Hope they stay busy on the weekends - it's clearly their bread and butter.",

Our waiter was actually quite good, it's everyone else we encountered that was the problem.    It's been two years since we've been here and I remember why. The restaurant is quite small and awkwardly situated. We arrived at 5:20 on a Sat and they were already running a wait. Watching the staff work, it's no mystery why. They appear to not have bus staff. The three teenage hostesses are also responsible for bussing. They have neither bus tubs or trays. They bus the tables by hand. Pick up two glasses, walk to the back, gather napkins, walk to the back, two plates, walk to the back...you get the idea. Then they search for a rag to clean the top, search for the cleaner...ugh!  Forget cleaning the floor.  Our already double seated waiter swept his own station, which was very messy from a recently departed kids party, while the hostesses chatted.  Watching these kids run the show was painful.   When our appetizer arrived, the runner just stared at our table waiting for us to move things around and make space. She brought no plates. Those came five mins later.  When the pizza arrived, the runner ( another person) set the food down but did not clear the appetizer dishes, even though it was clear we were finished. The hostesses stood by in clear site and picked up nothing. Finally our server (he was the only staff of the night I wouldn't fire), came for them.  I'm not sure who the manager of this place is, but the staff needs a lot of training!!  I'm guessing this place stays in business because of the location, because I can't think of another reason.",

The only thing where I feel they fall short is in the inconsistency of the quality of their pizza. Sometimes is really good and others is not. They seem to put the minimum amount of ingredients possible. There have been times when I can count the pepperoni slices in one hand or I will get a pizza without hardly any cheese on it.",

The pizza was clearly Made in a brick oven and was very satisfying. I am a NYer and can be a pizza snob, and this pizza definitely exceeded my expectations. There were a variety of options that didn't disappoint. Consider it gourmet pizza...not your typical NY slice.",

Not to mention the fact the we waited over 45 minutes for a pizza that we called in. Was told it would be ready for pick up within 10 minutes... we sat there and finally after asking again, they checked the warming drawer and there sat the pizza. The lady at the bar was super nice and apologetic but everything in the restaurant just seemed rushed and it seemed like no one had any communication with each other",

Don't get me wrong, this is the American version of pizza, something that would immediately cause a riot in Italy and cost your life in Napoli, but still I can brave it and be happy. We come here often as the waiters are nice, they have a place to eat outside and their desserts are good too.",

Blakeney Shopping Center,  particularly on weekend evenings,  is terribly crowded so, in general,  we avoid eating at any restaurants there though we live less than 2 miles away.  That being said, we went there for a mid week lunch last week and as expected the food was great. I had their Hawaiian pizza though I swapped the sauce to a red sauce....it was great. Our server, I can't remember his name, was kind and friendly.  Overall, everyone in our party was pleased.  Brixx's has good food and a large beer selection.  Though it won't be on a weekend we will be back.",

My salad was pretty good but my husband's cheese pizza had black crust but he refuses to send food back. The TV was showing a cop/detective type show and someone was being choked with a rope. There were young children present, so one of the many TV's playing it was changed but not the others. Overall, we were annoyed to wait on drink so long, the food so long(they did not have many occupied tables at this time), asked for more drinks that never arrived and so on. We won't spend money their again. It's obvious customer service and pride in ones job is not the mantra there. People pay to eat out because they don't just want a meal made for them but they also want an enjoyable wait staff.",

In addition to roomy booths and tables inside, there is great outdoor seating overlooking the fun park and fountains at Blakeney. The bar is fully stocked with a great beer selection that features local beers in the Carolinas. It's always fun to test a beer from Fort Mill or Asheville! Let's hear it for local support!  The menu is solid with great pizza, yummy sandwiches, and delicious salads. Personal favorites are the spicy shrimp pizza (with basil and cholula hot sauce) and Brixx salad, which has goat cheese and pine nuts--seriously my mouth is watering as i type. Also nice is any pizza can be made on gluten-free or wheat crust, and there are vegan cheese options for those who need it.  I also always appreciate the good service. Last trip we had a server named Colby who was dead on with her recommendations. She told us what pizzas were best with which sauces, and was great about us splitting a salad. She even pointed out we could order one pizza with two different halves without any additional fees.    Brixx is accommodating, delicious and fun!",

    "text": "I wasn't super impressed. The wait was an hour which turned in to more like 1.5 hrs because it started storming. Not their fault on the wait because they had to close the outdoor seating. The staff was at the end of their rope. I was sitting next to the hostess as she was muttering under her breath about people taking so long. Usually I would just brush that off but I found it really unprofessional since there was a 4-top, a 2-top and a booth waiting to be cleaning and the hostess was doing nothing to help. We got to our table and the waitress was ok. She did her part. We ordered the hummis appetizer, a margarita pizza and the 4x4 pizza. I forgot to take pictures because we were all starving. The hummus appetizer was good. Pitas were warn and dusted with a seasoning that tasted like a cross between a nacho chip and chilli. The hummus itself was different. Very think and not blended smooth. I'd eat it again but the pizza, that's a different story. The 4x4 was a salt lick and I don't normally mind salt but this was awful. The Salt over powered everything. The crust was good it had a nice chewy texture. The same goes for the margarita Pizza, crust was good. The taste of the margarita was ok. We're used to having it with a tomato sauce base so my wife was a little confused. She needs Pizza with sauce because it helps everything slide down. I'd order it again because I didn't think it was bad but the experience of the Holy place was kind of disappointing. This was an ok place if you have kids, but if you are trying to have a conversation then I would skip it. You are practically yelling for the server to hear you and having a conversation across the table without yelling is almost impossible. I really wanted this to be a good place. :-(",

    "text": "Excellent pizza here, with lots of gluten free options!!! We came here with a friend of ours who is on a very strict gluten free diet. He recommended several items on the menu that were gluten free, and all pizzas can be customized to have gluten free doughs (but as I learned today, that doesn't mean the ingredients are also gluten free so make sure you get what you prefer!)  I got a pizza with half spinach and artichoke (the special of the day, with spinach, artichoke, cheese, slices of tomatoes and grilled chicken) and half pimento cheese (jalapeno pimento cheese, roasted red peppers, bacon and fresh spinach). My boyfriend got the barbecue chicken pizza, and our friend got the spicy blt. All our pizzas were made with gluten free crust and we asked for them to be on the crispier side. All of them came out excellent.   Service was great, atmosphere was cool, cleanliness was on par.  The only down side I can think of is the extra $3 for gluten free dough. The pizzas were about $11 each plus the $3 for the dough, and we each ate all of ours. We were stuffed but not the sick-to-our-stomach stuffed. We could have easily taken half home but we knew we wouldn't remember to eat it.   Would definitely like to come back next time we're in town. So many of the other menu items looked appetizing!",

I was surprised at the amazing taste and the crunch in that pizza (The one with four Italian meats). Now I'm not saying it beats or even comes close to my New York pizza, but for pizza out in the these parts, it was an incredibly nice surprise.   Although I only go to Charlotte once or twice a month, which limits the amount of times I would visit the same restaurant more than once, this is one place I would not mind going to again... And it's a chain.   Also, I might add, Jeff, the waiter who served my friends and me, was one of the most accurate people in the restaurant business. I don't say that lightly. Never has a waiter or waitress's told me what to expect with such accuracy. What he said I would get was exactly what I got. That to me, means a lot. Kudos to Jeff! The manager was very nice, too.   Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, the artichoke dip is an appetizer you cannot go wrong with.",

This last one included:  I Never got the drink that I ordered, I didn't have silverware, our server disappeared and when I asked another server for my drink he nodded yes to my order but nothing came.  After 20 minutes I waved him down and he said in a SNARKY quip - I am not your server!  When our server finally appeared she too did not bring a drink - but the manager.  The 4 Tabs were so messed up we were worried we would miss the event.  The server had easy orders!  Manager offered nothing to us to compensate for an awful experience.  DO NOT GO HERE - this is the third and final straw for me",

    "text": "Been here a number of times with and without grandchildren.  Located in the large shopping center at the junction of Rea Road and Audrey Kell Road.  A franchise very popular in Charlotte it is consistently good.  They keep it clean and the staffs are pretty much always on point.  Although located in a busy shopping center, this location has a pleasant fenced off dining area outside.  Not too noisy and most importantly, if you have children with you they cannot get out if they wander.  Sometimes they do slip away, so with cars continually roaming the shopping center it is reassuring that they will be safe, even if your attention slips.  I especially like the menu choices.  There are lots of them and they are creative and interesting.  I like the shrimp with hot sauce and the wild mushroom with arugula.  And the crusts are thin and charred a bit by their super hot pizza oven.  One 10\" pizza is more than enough for a meal.    Good bar with an excellent selection of beers.  Many on tap.  Prices are reasonable for drinks and pizza.  There are some other menu items, but we usually stick to the pies.",

She loves their pizza, but pizza has been such a turn off since being pregnant since red sauce gives me all sorts of heartburn and acid reflux.  Brixx has a lot of options for pizza without red sauce, which I love!! I've tried the Quattro Formaggi (I sub fontina for the goat cheese since I don't like goat cheese), and the Margherita. Both do not have red sauce, and are wonderful.  I also really like the bruschetta. I lived in Naples, Italy for 7 years and feel that the bruschetta at Brixx is pretty similar, so 5 stars on that!  The girl I work with gets basic pepperoni pizza and Brixx Sticks. Both are good on a regular basis. We also get the lemonade (a small up-charge)-- my favorite is the Root Beer (even though it's not refillable).   Today, I felt that I should actually do a review because our waiter was so great! I think his name is Derek, I'm not sure, and I kind of have a bad memory right now. But, our service exceeded other visits today!",

The bartenders, I normally sit at the bar, even if my girlfriend accompanies me (I love that she likes to sit at bar as well sometimes) give great service and I never have to wait long for my food or a beer pour.  Brixx must be a great place to work, because the same two bartenders have worked there for the past 5 years or so.  Great beer selection and they always have a special or two to choose from.  I like thin pizza and crispy crust, which  they do both very well.      Still no wifi but I use their neighbors service and I am good!   Glad this place is close to my home!

I will say that the waitress did attempt to speak with her manager but nothing happened and nothing changed.  After watching this daytime manger poorly attempt to clean two tables I decided any efforts would be worthless.

I had the Americo, which features pepperoni and mushroom toppings.  The sauce was well balanced and the crust was nicely done, not too chewy.  The pepperoni was good but not great -- not too salty.  My daughter had the Margherita pizza which was not as good as the Americo.  The tomatoes were bland and had a tendency to make the crust soggy.  The basil seemed to lack the flavor punch I expect in a Margherita pizza.  The cheese was middle of the road, which surprised me as it was \"housemade\".  If it was the same as was used on the Americo, the lack of sauce exposed it more.  The waiter was excellent and he overcame the lower score I could have given on the basis of the Margherita alone.  Overall, it was an enjoyable dinner and I would return.",

My wife and I also split a Brixx salad, loaded with goat cheese. It's anyways fresh and tasty.   Our server was vigilant in keeping us a fresh soda refill. There appear to be quite a few of the same wait staff who have been here a while. One last plus, is that BOGO coupons are readily available. Although, not a Gotta Try, you just can't go wrong here.",

If you checked in on Yelp at that time it was only about 20 minutes. A lot of good business was lost. I think those girls need some help with their timing.",

We had the wild mushroom pizza, jerk chicken and vegetable pizzas, and the fire pita with hummus starter. The pita was pretty good I thought, the hummus forgettable.   The mushroom and jerk chicken pizza were both sans red sauce, and the mushrooms with arugula are always a nice pairing, but I wasn't a fan of the jerk chicken pizza. The veggie pizza was also just pretty average. The dough was  not bad, still a little left to chew on with the thin crust, but I think they overdid it on the cheese, and it wasn't great cheese at that. I was tempted to order the tiramisu simply because they said it was made fresh every day, and I am a fan of home-made tiramisu. Sadly, it scored a huge thumbs down, it had none of the fresh airy just-whipped today texture, it was heavy on the rum, disgustingly heavy on the sugar, and the four of us together could not muster up the wits to eat it all. It was a tiramisu gone wrong, a thick, unappealing glob of sickly sweet cream and to top of, a squirting of what I suspect was hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, and bad chocolate shavings on top. Oh the shame.  So to summarize, I am still on the quest to find decent pizza in Charlotte and I will not be back here to satisfy the craving.",

The guy said if there was a wait, it wouldn't be a long one. Famous last words. We waited 40 minutes for a table for 11. They had to pull 3 tables together, and the people at the 3rd table just. wouldn't. leave. I thought the food came out pretty quickly. I got the Brixx Stixx, which are parmesan bread sticks with 2 dipping sauces. I thought my 4.5 year old would like those. He DID like them, but the honey mustard sauce was incredibly spicy and I had to take that one away. I got the Tomato and Basil Pesto pizza, which is basil pesto, mozzarella, roasted garlic cloves, roma tomatoes and goat cheese. It was good but not great. The crust was really chewy and I prefer a thinner, crispier crust. I let my husband try it and he said it was too rich for him. He got the Margherita, and although he said it was OK, I didn't like it. Again, the weird crust, and then I like a more traditional Margherita with tomato sauce. This one comes without it. We thought our son would eat a piece of our pizza, but he didn't like it, so we ordered another order of the Brixx Stixx for him. I would be willing to try some pasta here, but just did not care for the pizza.",
