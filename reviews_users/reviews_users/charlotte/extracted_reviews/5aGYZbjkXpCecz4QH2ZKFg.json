The sesame chicken stood out to me and everybody and their mama was loading up on the butter shrimp. The lunch buffet is about $8 and that seems pretty fair.  There were no major negatives. It's a solid place. But it's by no means outstanding. Nothing made me think to myself that this was going to be in my regular rotation.",

But Dragon buffet is one I will always fall back on when Im hit with a sudden asian buffet craving.    I love their buttered shrimp, although you have have lady luck with you when they bring them out.  People pile them in their plates higher than the himalayas!  I mean, c'mon people, Im right behind you praying that Ill get alteast 2 pieces!  But they are that good.  Greed will take over when you taste them.  I also get the green beans, which they load with garlic (a good thing if you dont plan on a smooch-fest later), soy glazed mushrooms, a fake crab casserole, scallops with zucchini, etc.  Soups are yummy too and they even have a dumpling section (but its pork, so I didnt taste it).  Sometimes they have Singapore noodles, which has a good curry flavor other times its just lo-mein.  They even have sea bass and salmon on the buffet (not all the time, I guess its seasonal) They offer good options for vegetarians and pescatarians like myself.  I didnt bother looking at the other protein dishes but they're good and plenty.  Crab rangoons are too cream cheesy, but doesnt stop me from eating them.  A good deal for under $8.00 for lunch.",

The coconut chicken is awesome, butter shrimp is awesome.  My only knock is they don't switch up the menu at all and put different things out there.  I'm sure they are trying to save money and not have to buy tons of product to keep switching out....but still.  I'd like to see a few more dishes with shrimp or even something with scallops.  I will continue to eat here when I cannot afford Tin Tin.  This place deserves a solid 4 stars for a Chinese buffet....start varying the menu and I will give you a 5.",

Don't get me wrong; their selection of different Asian style meats were great, but I would have appreciated more choices of vegetables other that just buttered broccoli and limp cabbage.  My favorite food from the buffet was their their \"baked crabmeat\".  It was imitation crab, but still tasted great.  Good thing I'm generally a fan of cheap white fish.  Their service wasn't the best.  While we were being seated, our host got distracted by something and just forgot about us.  Our waitress got my friend's drink order wrong, too.  All this must have been due to the fact that the place was filled nearly to capacity.  At $6.95 for an adult weekday lunch buffet, I'll certainly give Dragon Buffet another shot.",

I see some of the other reviews complain about lack of selection here, but for my tastes, this is far and away the best. The dishes I like here are mostly chicken, and they have quite a few varied styles which are really tasty. You have to accept that its a BUFFET, so the classic dishes you might order in a fancy place are not all available, but what's there is excellent every visit. You cannot do better anywhere for a $10.00 buffet !!",

    "text": "I wanted Bill Spoons today, but didn't have cash and was too lazy to drive to an ATM. I'll see you next time Bill, next time. So, Chinese it was!   3.5 stars to no avail so 4 it is. Dragon Buffet isn't the greatest place, but its far from being the worst. It is though, my preferred Chinese restaurant in the Billy Graham area.   Typically, I too normally avoid Chinese buffets, less tin tin. Dragon Buffet though, is a restaurant in which I prefer the buffet. All of the dishes I've ordered off the menu here have been horrible. Orange chicken was atrocious. The sauce they use for their sweet and sour dishes taste nothing more than diluted strawberry jam. Hot and spicy beef was lacking the spicy and the flavor. So, I avoid the menu altogether and go straight to the buffet - even for my to go orders.   Their buffet offers a nice variety of items. Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, and the usuals etc. but I have my favorites:  #1 is the buttered shrimp. Can't go wrong with tempura fried shrimp!  #2 is the Indonesian or Malay chicken..I think. My memory fails me worse than I failed the series 7. I forget if it was malay or indonesian and I was just there an hour ago, lol.  #3 is the fried rice. Abnormally brown as heck, not the greatest tasting and greasier than fried chicken, but dang I can't get enough of it.  #4 (kudos if you caught this earlier, lol) is the fantasy chicken. I can only eat one or two pieces though. This chicken is made in a sweet, I think mayonnaise type sauce. Very strange, and unique. It isn't the greatest, but different.   And all else, I get a sampling of the potatoes, mushrooms, and cabbage. Sometimes I get the imitation crab bake that looks like a casserole. This too has some type of sour cream or mayonnaise sauce. It is unique but isn't for everyone though.   They have been recently offering pad thai at the buffet. But the pad thai is made with clear vermicelli noodles. That should be a crime. It looks strikingly similar to a Filipino dish called pancit. In fact, it taste more like pancit than pad thai too. Skip that.   Today I also saw a new item, the shrimp biscuit. Dough stuffed with some type of shrimp and mayonnaise concoction. Different again, but I didn't like this one.   I also asked for a cup of hot oil/chili today. It was interesting. Call me crazy, but it tasted like the chili on the outside those mexican mango chili lollipops. I dunno if that's a bad thing?   To go orders at the Buffet cost $3.95 a pound. If you splurge, you might end up with a $15 dollar to go box. If you only get what you want and don't fall victim to temptation and pack a sampling of everything thats out, you can make out pretty well.   edit - service is always good here.They are very friendly and the restaurant is very clean too.   All in all, Dragon Buffet isn't the best chinese place, but I've acquired a taste for it and can't seem to get enough.",

I should have realized my mistake when the trays were scarcely empty with just 2-3 pieces in them. I kept being told by servers that more food would be out in a couple minutes.  I decided to \"snack\" on what was left while waiting for the food to be replenished. My husband chose not to eat at all in his disappointment. Still no food was brought out. We ended up calling it a loss and paid the full adult buffet charge and left. About an hour after getting home; I started to feel really sick...stomach cramps and nauseated.  This soon turned into an \"all nighter\" of running back and forth to the bathroom being sick and feeling absolutely miserable for 2 days. After researching the North Carolina Public Health Inspections I can see why. Wish I would have reviewed that first.  Please learn from my mistake and misery and pass on this place who would rather take short cuts instead of considering others well being.",

So if you actually enjoy the buffet style (which boggles my mind), then you may actually think Dragon Buffet is worthy of a higher rating. But the combination of buffet & Chinese (also another non fav of mine) doesn't really bode well for this review.  The food actually does taste pretty good for buffet food, from orange chicken, to beef & broccoli, to all your favs, they have quite a bit on tap. They have the usual rice options, & I actually enjoyed the vegetarian egg rolls. But I wouldn't recommend the ice cream, it's just a little too dicey for me. So they do have plenty of options & I'm sure a Chinese buffet fan would love to peruse the options all lined up for the taking. And along with the set price & rapid quick seating & service, I can see why people keep this place quite packed.  I probably won't be heading back here anytime soon, but they do have plenty of Chinese food options for a good price. So bring your appetite along with an open mind (if you're like me).",

Both I would give an 8/10.  I'm not that great of a fan of the chicken in the chicken & broccoli, but again the broccoli is more legit. I'm definitely a fan of their teriyaki chicken, it seems as though it was grilled on an outdoor grill (some may not be a fan of it having those little partial burnt flakes, but I love grilled food). I usually love sesame chicken but I'm Really not a fan of theirs, to the extent it's about an 3 or 4/10. Also I'm a BIG sweet tea fan and theirs is horrible...

Usually with their perfectly steamed rice, bourbon chicken, great broccoli and usually some of the good ol General Tsao chicken. We fill up the box and we both eat for under 11 bucks. To sit is much more but still totally affordable.",

My perception is always mediocre food and potential for food safety issues, not to mention the idiots with no social skills mishandling the serving utensils and sticking their fingers in the food.   I have been hard pressed to find good Chinese food in the Charlotte area and this restaurant was recommended by a friend, who knows \"buffet\" is a bad concept in my world. So, it had to be good if they went out on the limb to get me to go there.   I visit this restaurant only for lunch. I can get in and out quickly even when its crowded, which is 99% of the time.  They pack them in because the price is right. About $9.50 for the buffet, ice tea and tip.   The food quality is a pleasant surprise. I do not think anything is off the mark and they are consistent. The food taste the same every time. They definitely use high quality ingredients and overall good food is the end result. They offer many choices of chicken, shrimp and beef. Excellent soup and items for vegetarians. Great depth and breadth in their offering.  I would recommend this restaurant because of the above average price/value relationship. Very good service and nice owners. Its still a bufffffffet though!  Parking can be difficult when they are slammed. Just pull in the Home Depot lot and walk across the street for the no hassel approach.",

Prior reviews seemed favorable so Dragon Buffet  was the choice.  Easy access off 485 & Tryon. We arrived around 3:30, no waiting and only a couple other families were eating.  My wife and I, along with our 5 boys ( 17, 16, 14, 10 , 7 ) were seated, ordered our drinks, and then went to the bufett.  They have a great selection, including Sushi.  The food was great, some buffets the food is dried out from sitting so long. the staff was very attentitive to the buffet, keeping it clean and stocked. Desert Bar and 4 selections of Ice Cream!  the restraunt itself was clean and attractive  The best part was of course feeding a family of 7 for $54  I do not know if prices change in the evening, but I can say Dragon Buffet will be a regular stop for us when we are in the area!",

Two words to describe this restaurant would be clean and fresh.      It is located it a small strip mall across the parking lot from Walmart. It has a small parking lot with convenient spots.     I was greeted by the manager upon arrival and  escorted to my seat. Comfortable decor and friendly staff. My server asked for my beverage order and it was at my table upon my arrival from the buffet.       Now the food was the experience. The selections were all not your standard buffet grub. You had your regular selection of soups, but the wonton were fresh and steamed.  There was also a selection of beef and vegetable Dim Sum and lightly fried pork dumplings. Some of the assorted foods were Black Pepper Beef, Indian Chicken (spicy curry sauce), boneless spare ribs and egg foo young. They also have assorted seafood dishes. Dessert selections were standard and there was scoopable ice cream.     Restaurant serves PepsiCo products and has a limited beer and wine selection.      Overall restaurant was excellent and a value. Lunch price was $7.99 per person with dinner pricing at $8.99. They also offer to go at $4.25 a pound.",

    "text": "Decent is a fair word to describe Dragon Buffet food. My husband and I wanted to try this for somewhere different to go. The food was typical Chinese buffet quality for the most part. Buffet was kept cleaner than some I've been at. They had a tray of heavily buttered broccoli that was ok. Mushrooms we're ok. Spring rolls were good. I liked the breaded shrimp but hubby did not. I did have to wait longer than usual for the low mein to be replenished and when it finally was, I was disappointed in the flavor. It appeared that some of the food had been sitting out a long time and needed replaced... had that dry and absorbed look. We most likely won't be back here. We both agree that we'd try another new place instead.",

The restaurant is busy during the lunch hour and parking is scarce as many times you have to cross over into the Wally World parking lot.  One item that stands out on this buffet is the hot and sour soup.  I could almost bathe in this as it is one of the best soups I've had.    One suggestion for the owners is to add more spicy selections.  One of my biggest complaints about all chinese restaurants is the lack of spice.  But this place is overall ok and I do come back here once in a while.",

This is not a place to go if you want sushi, because while they have it, it is not a center piece, but a after thought.    They have some of the better crab rangoons that I have had at any restaurant.  3 serving islands with hot food.  The popcorn butter shrimp is very good.  The Egg Drop soup is hit or miss, the days that it is on it is great, the days they are off, it is like yellow water.  I also recommend the pepper pork, Mongolian beef, and chicken and broccoli, as they are all good.    Of course my 4 year old son always wants to go because he gets the ice cream dessert.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch for two people our total was $22.93 with drinks. I absolutely love their crab Ragoon. Loved their vegetable fried rice. Sesame chicken wasn't the best but it definitely wasn't the worst, I've had a lot nastier so nothing really special there. Same for the Lo mein- not the best nor the worst. The buffet was kept clean and seemed organized.  They don't have a big selection for fruit or dessert so that was kinda disappointing for a sweet tooth like myself. **They did have ice cream so I wasn't to upset!**  They are very welcoming and felt right at home. Never a dirty dish if I went to the buffet and returned and always had our drinks refilled.   We aren't from around this area so if you have an IPhone and use the built in GPS you may end up back on the interstate. You can easily miss the turn which isn't the buffets  fault and didn't affect my rating whatsoever just putting that out there for travelers!  My biggest disappointment is it wasn't really cool inside, yeah it's a buffet and the steaming hot food makes it hotter inside but still, we sat a little ways away and it wasn't really cool either way.   I would definitely come back! Thanks for the good food.",

Dark, too small to be a good buffet and now I understand why a dinner buffet is only $8.99.  Food:  Good flavor but very limited options.  Only about 4 steam tables and a lot of standard things that you see on most buffets are missing.    Cleanliness:  Dirty silverware on the table that I had to complain about.  Had to get new silverware and ask the waiter for a cup of hot water to kill any germs on the silverware.  Service:  Never checked on during our meal and never offered a refill on our drinks.  Bottom line is that this is not the best buffet that I've gone to.  They need to move to a bigger and nicer location or close down and renovate this place from top to bottom.  The decor killed my appetite, had one plate and was done.",

Yes, they have a limited selection and the warming pans are small so sometimes they may be out of something for a few minutes. But that doesn't happen very often. I would much rather have that than the hog trough pans  used in the mega buffets with food that's been sitting around for hours on end that all taste the same ... like crap!  Fast turnover and quality food, that's what makes this a consistently good buffet.  Are there bigger Chinese buffets in Charlotte? Yes, of course. Are there BETTER buffets in Charlotte?

Listen up HATERS, it is $7.99 for lunch, get over yourself, it is down and dirty, nothing fancy........  Some notes:  1.  Sushi is below average and nasty.    2.  The black pepper pork is actually terrific, its a sweet pepper sauce, I have never had anything like it.  3.  The Vietnamese Rolls are interesting, kind of like a Mexican beef taqiuito, but with an Asian spill.   Really good.    4.  Crab meat and cheese casserole was pretty good, especially when you scoop it on the French buttered bread.  5.  The buttered fried shrimp were tasty.  That is all folks, have a RICE day!  :-)",

It's odd not to see a 30 foot wide mural of a pagoda on the wall or Chinese music playing loudly on the sound system. Not here. It feels like this place just took over the spot yesterday. Anyway, on to the food. It basically has 3 8-foot serving buffets for entrees and 1 more for desserts (possibly the smallest buffet I've ever seen). Quite odd were 2 small plates of sushi rolls sitting in the middle of the dessert table with no sushi station (or chef) to be seen. They looked like California rolls you'd walk into Harris-Teeter and buy (but not even that quality). 6pm dinner and the place was fairly empty (which is good because if this place got slammed, they would be out of food in 10 minutes). I did see an unusually high number of walk-in traffic filling up take out containers (which you'd think is a good sign). I will say the hot and sour soup was a highlight. Everything else was meh. I did not see General Tso's or Beef and Broccoli (common buffet staples). The egg roll was mush. The overall temperature of all our food was \"just a little warm\" (which seems to be a consistent comment on here). You're basically down to green beans and picking broccoli out of a chicken dish if you want a vegetable. The salmon was cut up into little 2\" x 2\" squares (weird, maybe they are just portioning it or the buffet can't hold normal salmon fillets like other buffets serve it). I could go on and on. I can just honestly say I've never walked out of a place knowing I won't be back.",

Customer service: Some of the waitresses have language barriers, but they do their best to accommodate you, even if that means bringing over the owner.  Food: Consistently hot, fresh and tasty.",
