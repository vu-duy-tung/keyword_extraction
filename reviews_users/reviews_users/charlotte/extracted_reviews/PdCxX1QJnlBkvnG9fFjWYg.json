My husband and I stopped in for a cappuccino and a dirty chai latte (a chai latte with two shots of espresso - highly recommended) and I couldn't leave without trying a cheddar biscuit because they looked so amazing! I had a cheddar biscuit sandwich and it melted in my mouth. Each bite tasted incredibly fresh and was filled with sharp cheddar flavor. I'd happily go back often if we lived in the area.",

Their food is absolutely delicious--I might be developing an addiction to their Black Friday sandwich (turkey, cranberry-apple chutney, and happiness) and their coffee is very good, too.  All of their staff are also super friendly and seem to be fairly knowledgeable about what they serve.   Definitely worth checking out if you are in the mood for some good coffee or lunch.  And don't forget to pick up a loaf of fresh-made bread, too.  Their Rosemary-Olive Oil is divine.",

    "text": "I was honestly shocked to see so many four and five star reviews, I must be more of a stickler for customer service than most. Service is always slow slow slow. Slow when the bakery is full, slow when the bakery is empty. I've been on several occasions and have never received an order in less than 20-25 minutes, even for just a biscuit with avocado. The staff appears stressed or ULTRA casual depending on the day, but there's never a sense of urgency whatsoever, that I've witnessed. Part of good customer service is providing your guest with what they need in a reasonable amount of time- never happened here.  However- every single thing I've ever ordered has been delicious. Pastries, cheddar biscuit, sandwiches. I will continue to visit Sunflour but only when I know I have an hour to spend, never when I am hangry, and always with the knowledge that I will be waiting on my food for a long time. Coffee is okay.  I think with some restructuring and better management they could turn things around. Get some professional help, guys. Underwhelming service and long ticket times are going to hurt your business, if they haven't already. There are other bakeries I choose to solicit over Sunflour because i know they'll hit all my marks.  food- five stars service- one star",

    "text": "I happened to see this place driving to midtown and am always attracted to family-owned and/or non-chain locations. I was extremely impressed with the website, the vegan options, and the fact that they donate their unsold goods to charity. Can't go wrong with that, so I was happy to patronize.  SBC is situated in a quiet and scenic part of Charlotte, neighbored by other trendy and fairly new restaurants in that area. We visited on Sunday morning, and I opted for the dark chocolate macaron and a chai latte. The macaron? Absolute perfection! It was creamy, pillowy, slightly crunchy, and the chocolate just melted in your mouth. The latte was good decent--what one expects from a chai latte.  I then had the fig, brie, and apple sandwich. I was really excited to try this as I've made a similar version at home that was good. With professionals making it, I knew it would be superb.  I wasn't thrilled.   Brie was a bit too mild and subtle to pair well with the sweetness of the fig jam. A sharper, more pungent cheese would be a better option so you're really getting the combination of sweet and savory. I was little shocked at the price tag too. In all we had the following: two sandwiches, a latte, an Izze, a macaron, and a muffin. Total? $29.99. That seems a bit much. Now give me a dozen macarons? I'll gladly pay that much, but it seemed a bit pricey for what we ordered. I could be wrong though. I'm not holding that against them.  My only other complaint is the preparation of the sandwiches. While I was waiting for my order, I noticed that the preparer was handling food with his bare hands. This was extremely off-putting, and I nearly said something but was discouraged. If there is one thing I don't like it's someone handling my food without gloves. Yes, I know, it probably happens all the time in restaurants I visit and never see it, but the difference was I DID see it. I tweeted my discontent on April 13 in the hopes that they might change this, but I haven't gotten a response. I'm not angry--I just think it's a better way to do business.   Will I go back? YOU BETCHA. The staff was brilliant--big smiles and happy faces, so I can definitely see this becoming my new Sunday morning spot to bring my friends to.",

They have THE best croissants that I have ever had in my life. They are both fluffy and crispy, due to their three-day fermentation process (hey, it works for beer, so why not pastry?) and 27 layers of buttery goodness. Just writing this reviews makes me wish it were breakfast so I could get one with egg, bacon, and cheese.  They also house my favorite cake/cupcake of all time (their caramel). The beauty is in how it is not over-sweetened and perfectly frosted. The moist density of the cake is amazing.  Rounding out the trifecta is the fleur de Sel cookie with its truly masterful combination of dark chocolate and sea salt. There are simply no words. Get it!  As a tip, you can call ahead and order to bypass the line during busy times.!",

The cashier thought one of the scones was gluten free & vegan, but couldn't confirm with 100% certainty (and there was no sign in front of that particular item like the others).  Please consider offering a gluten free muffin and a cupcake or two.  Then I will become a frequent customer!",

I am totally willing to give it another shot and I think next time I'll order the cinnamon bun or a lunch sandwich. I've had a breakfast sandwich before and the avocado sold me on it. There just wasn't much taste to this blueberry pastry although it sure looks pretty. The pastry was very flaky but I just needed some more flavor, like vanilla or cinnamon! The Americano with steamed milk was pretty good, and it is a great atmosphere for working or lunch dates/meetings. I observed quite a few business lunches and couples meeting for lunch!",

The issue I consistently have with this bakery is the lack of consistency and the amount of time it takes to order anything. The girls are always leaving the register to run and make coffee's or grab pastries so a line of 5-6 people will take around 10 minutes (just to order), if you order a sandwich it'll take around 10-15 minutes (altogether 25 minutes) you have to then walk all the way back to the register to get a spoon or napkins because sometimes they include one, but more often not. I'm always here on my 15 min lunch breaks and I never get a chance to actually eat because of how inefficient the process of ordering and receiving food is. I wish the owners would go to Sabor to see how they can move 10 people and orders in under 10 minutes. If I see a line of 6+ people I end up just leaving because it means I won't have the time to eat. The employees are friendly and wonderful but even though the location is extremely convenient and the food is good I am always trying to find more convenient options.",

    "text": "Apparently, it's been almost four years since my previous visit to Sunflour Baking Company.  According to my previous review, it had a coffeehouse-like atmosphere with living room furniture.  I can't quite remember what it looked like when I wrote that, but apparently they've changed since then.  There's the counter, dessert/pastry display case, and then several dining tables and chairs.    Our party of five went on a Sunday morning and it was very crowded.  Fortunately, by the time we ordered, a couple of two-seater tables had opened up that we could pull together (along with an additional chair).  They offer a good variety of breakfast (egg) sandwiches with a variety of breads (rosemary, multigrain, croissant, and biscuit) you can have them on.  Three of us ordered the rosemary, two had the croissant.  The croissants were HUGE, probably the equivalent of getting two Burger King Croissandwiches.  I tried the rosemary bread with egg, provolone, spinach, and roasted tomato.  The homemade bread was delicious, and reminiscent of Macaroni Grill's homemade rosemary bread.  The filling could have used some spices (or even salt and pepper); the eggs just tasted a little bland to me.   We noticed, though, that the owner or a good manager must not have been on duty.  During our entire visit, nobody was out wiping the tables.  Granted, it was crowded and every seat taken, but when we left, there were a few empty tables that just sat dirty.  To me, that's not a good first impression when you're walking in the door.  It's just not inviting.  Also, when you pay by credit card, you're asked (on their iPad) for a tip.  You're given several options (from a range of like 10-20%).  First of all, tipping BEFORE you even get your meal?  Tacky.   Second,  the only \"service\" we received was that someone brought our food out to us.  Nobody checked on us.  And they want you to take your trays and dishes to the garbage, dishwashing, and recycling bins yourself.  What exactly are we tipping for?  I had to wipe down our table.  I had to get up and get napkins for our table and sugar for our coffee.  I had to get up to refill my water glass.  I had to take our dirty dishes up and separate everything.  If anything, they should be tipping me.  I'm not a fan of tipping at \"fast food\" places in the first place, but when you don't even clean tables, check on us, or take away dirty dishes, just what are we tipping for?    So...the food is fresh and good, but the quality of service and cleanliness really need to be stepped up.",

It was a traditional Macchiato, that has a couple shots of expresso and one shot of milk (ends up being 1/2 a regular coffee cup full) buy it was only $2.75 and it did the job and tastes damn good too. I also had a dark caramel iced coffee which was kind of toffee flavored and it was great. But I liked their crossaints the best. I've heard they're  made in house, which I guess is a painstaking process, but the result is deliciously perfect and their sandwiches are just that good too. I didn't try it with with egg,  because I heard they were microwave eggs but it was good without. I'd recommend going there, pastries and coffee are real good; while sandwich selections are expansive and pastry menu is smaller compared to Amelie's. It's definitely a worthy competitor.",

    "text": "Let's take a trip down memory lane. When I was 14, I was psyched to be old enough to have a \"legal\" job so I could go to work for an epicurean shop that made chocolate truffles, sold gourmet food, catered events and had a little epicurean deli. It was undoubtedly one of the major influencing factors of my food snobbitude.  Well this little shop had the best sandwiches, including a tuna melt that defined tuna melts for the rest of my life. I like my tuna melt melted, which seems obvious, but is apparently much harder than it might seem. In fact I would say fewer than 25% of my tuna melts ordered from other establishments are actually melted. I also like my tuna salad w/o drowning in mayo or a lot of celery. Blech. I also prefer my tuna melts with cheddar and on a rye or sourdough with a nice tang.  In the days since aforementioned epicurean shop, I have found very very few acceptable tuna melts, yet ever hopeful, I keep searching. Eureka!! Today I hit paydirt and Sunflour has the most delicious tuna melt I've had, rivaling or surpassing my original tuna melt! It had a hint of lemon which really added to it, as well as dill and NO celery. Hallelujah!! I subbed in cheddar and put it on Sourdough of course.  I savored every bite.  Oh, but I guess most people don't come here for lunch (their options are admittedly limited to a few sandwiches).  They have a small case of sweet yummies including muffins, a cupcake or two du jour (one day it was key lime, today it was Coca Cola), cookies, bars, \"pop tarts\", buns (cinnamon, hazelnut orange, etc.) and scones. Now I have high standards for anything breakfasty.  I bake my scones lighter with buttermilk so they don't feel like a brick in my stomach after eating one. The Sunflour delivers. I would venture to say they are the best scones in Charlotte (besides mine and maybe those little butterscotch scones at Pewter Rose). Sometimes their cupcakes are great (devils food is best chocolate cupcake in town), but sometimes they're not as great and have crunchy frosting. Go for the smoother ganache frosting if you have a choice!  Did I mention they make gorgeous wedding cakes??   They support local suppliers and have plenty of tables and counter and banquette seating if you want to stick around, but it's not super cozy, so I don't see this place turning into Amelies.   If I no longer had student loans and a mortgage to pay off, this is the type of place I'd like to open.  I could see it now...",

I don't think there was a single dark corner there.  No, its bright and happy like the name. I leashed up the old hound dog and walked just over a mile to grab a couple of cheesy biscuits and a decaf iced Americano because they didn't have decaf coffee a-brewing.  They were tasty biscuits, I mean they were soft and cheesy so yeah.  I'll have to try some sweet stuff next time.  Everything *looked* pretty good in the glass. Things that would be nice... maybe a little outdoor seating, for us who wander with dogs?  I think you could fit a little wrought iron table or two out on the sidewalk.   Aaaand while I'm at it, some more expansive hours... like till 8 on weekdays.  Or at least have a couple of people around to sell pies and cupcakes until 8, even if you can't swing keeping the whole kitchen staff on till late.  Now in the summer I can go wherever whenever, but if I get back on teachin' hours I usually don't leave school until 5:30, so I'm sure some folks agree. So that's why we get 3.5, the food was better than OK but I don't know if I'm quite a \"fan\" yet.  We'll try to work it out.",

The cranberry chutney and brie just oozes out the side of the warm pressed sandwich (I painted a good picture, right?)  I love the tea and organic coffee here. This is a perfect spot for breakfast or lunch. Usually on the weekends or early morning during prime times there will be a line.  I haven't had any desserts yet, but they look amazing.

The outstanding: key lime tart. Simply delicious. The perfect combination of sweet and tart. Perfect custard and delicious buttery graham cracker crust. Almond torte: rich and almondy and great texture. Heavenly. Carmel cupcake: this is one of my favorite cupcakes. Not too sweet but a rich caramel flavor  Expresso bacon cupcake: they don't have this flavor a lot but get it when they do. Perfect combination of sweet and savory and fat. Sinful  Almond croissant: it's the size of a small child's head. Rich, buttery , flakey goodness  Butter roll: I use it as a bun for sandwich after toasting. Great with griuere cheese, pesto or avocado  Caramel cheesecake: divine. Creamy, rich, sweet but not overly so. Rich graham cracker crust. Yum!  Lemon bar: rich buttery shortcake with tart lemon curd. Amazing !  Earl grey cookie: it's delicious, buttery but not too sweet with a hint of earl grey  The good: tiramisu , raspberry cupcake , basil blueberry cheesecake , carrot cupcake, coconut macaroon   The okay:dirty mocha-- didn't have much mocha flavor  Nutella cupcake. I love Nutella but this was too sweet.   The not good: hazelnut orange bun. Not much hazelnut or orange flavor. Kinda stale  Matcha scone. Dry and no matcha flavor   They have half price on day old pastries.",

I decided to grab a dirty mocha and a bacon egg & cheese cheddar biscuit. The coffee was good! The mix of dark and white chocolates was perfect. The biscuit itself is super super tasty!

A place to grab coffee, breakfast, lunch, have a meeting, get some work done or pick up a delicious sweet treat. There is just something so soothing about sitting down and enjoying a little pot of tea. It's my out-of-the-yoga-studio zen moment. On the flip side, their cold brew is a huge rush of caffeine that will keep you going for hours. I drink a ton of coffee, but man that cold brew makes me bounce off the walls.  Need something to take to a party? Grab a loaf of Sunflour's Rosemary Olive Oil bread, a whole pie or some cupcakes.  I have a really hard time straying away from the cheddar biscuits here. They are great plain or as a breakfast sandwich. I'm also a big fan of the fig jam and brie sandwich. Although, I'm pretty sure I would eat a piece of cardboard if it had brie on it.   Service can be a little slow at times. I think that just goes with the laid back, casual atmosphere.

After discovering Sunflour, I realized I couldn't have gotten it more wrong. 9 our ten times, when you pick up your muffins, scones, and croissants,  they are still warm from the oven. That's how fresh they are. They have hit the nail on the head in every aspect. They aren't just fresh, they're delicious. Super sized cinnamon rolls smothered in cream cheese icing, vanilla sugar croissant dough rolls, chocolate chip scones, and that's just the beginning. They have authentic latte's and tons of cakes and deserts. This place place makes me forget all that is wrong with the world.",

I've been frequenting Sunflour since they opened. I am quite impressed with the changes they have made...padded seating, WiFi, enhanced display of products, and spotlighting local artists.",

(Both were pretty tasty, for what it's worth. My avocado melt could have used a little salt or seasoning.) The total was almost $20! For two sandwiches. No drinks. No sides.

My friend got the Brie and fig panini and wasn't happy with the ratio either-- they straight up dumped a whole jar of fig preserves on the bread.  Damn.  Other friend got the portobello melt panini which was pretty good, but could have had more flavor imo.  Overall really good lunch spot with decent sandwiches.",

Sunflour also serves Counter Culture coffee, which is a must try if you haven't tried it before. I got a cappuccino and it was perfect.    It was busy this afternoon, but despite the crowd everyone working was super friendly.

I ordered the egg, cheddar, and avocado sandwich on multigrain bread.  It was tasty, but the cooks left the wax paper on the cheddar cheese.  I brought it to a staff member's attention, and she said she would inform the kitchen staff. I also had a small cup of regular drip coffee.  It was good, but would have loved it if they'd had Stevia. My friend and I split a s'mores Pop Tart because we just couldn't resist!  It was absolutely delicious.  Would have been even better warm. Overall, I think it's a little overpriced and I wouldn't come here all the time but would certainly return.",

After I sat down, the line started to grow. I'd say this place is a pretty popular weekend morning spot. Anyway, sandwich came fairly quickly and really hit the spot. Croissant was huge and flaky (but a bit greasy), and the cheese was really tasty. Ham and eggs pretty standard. It was a filling sandwich.   I would give five starts, except that I didn't see a sausage option on the menu, and there was something sticky on my table. I will definitely be back for the chocolate croissant soon.

Their croissants are really large and it's amazing how many freakin' layers are in these things! You can immediately tell how much time and care the bakers put into these flaky pastries.

I've always been impressed with the friendly folks working here and their delicious lattes (chai latte - yum!) and pastries (Guinness Stout Cupcake - wow!), and sandwiches (anything made on a cheddar biscuit or croissant!). All of those things have remained impressive with the new team.  My minor gripe is the wait. I don't want to knock them too much since they're making everything fresh when you order, but it's not a place I can count on to get in & out of quickly. So if you've got a few extra minutes in your day, be sure to visit the new & improved Sunflour Bakery.",

It's quite cleverly called SunFLOUR, not Sunflower, which can be a little confusing considering its logo and decor are  accented with sunflowers.  Always jam packed in the mornings, this privately owned jewel offers delightful breakfast sandwiches on fresh breads as well as mouth watering baked goods highlighted by the flakiest, butteriest, most delectable and addictive apple turnover I have ever eaten. This is not your typical apple turnover. Get there early and, if you're lucky enough to get one before they've sold out, ask for it to be heated. Everything else is great too.  This place is a \"gotta try\". Easily five stars in my book!",

My husband had the seasonal Perfectly Peach sandwich with prosciutto and he also chose Rosemary bread. He said it was delicious. We finished with a giant cinnamon roll and a big and fresh oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. Both were worth the calories.   Because we arrived on a Saturday after 10:30a it was busy and all the tables in the small dining area were full. We almost left, but by the time the rest of or party arrived at nearly 11a, several tables became available.   Parking can also be an issue at Pecan shopping plaza where the restaurant is located. Lots of businesses and not enough parking.",

So I ventured here.   I love the vibe, the staff of super friendly ladies every time I have been in, and I love that they have vegan muffins! And delicious ones at that!! I mean perfection, \"are you sure this is vegan?\" type! They also have a very nice selection of breakfast sandwiches, though I cannot have any, my sisters have had them. They are large and filling, great flavor combos from traditional to creative. Lots of pastries to get your AM going and a good selection of coffee and organic teas! (Almond and soy milk available-again, yay!)   Sunflour is in a great location for a lot of businesses and hospital employees to run to, but also families from the neighborhoods surrounding it. So keep that in mind and be patient if they get busy! Bit of a hot spot in the prime AM and lunch hours. On the other hand, during slower hours, I've seen people getting some work done on laptops and slowly getting their day started.   As a vegan, lunch is not much of an option here for me, but I will keep them as a favorite for a good coffee and vegan pastry! Everyone give them a try. :)",

I gave this location 3 stars because my blackberry pastry was placed upside down or on its side in a very small paper bag, rather than in a flat box like the cinnamon roll I purchased with it, which was a disappointing oversight. Consequently the contents of the pastry fell out of the pastry shell and into the bag in transit and was a sticky, flaky mess - staff should be cautious of packaging delicate items properly. The pastry was crispy and lightweight so I will be coming back, but don't be afraid to stand up for your goods if ordering to go.",

That is fine for a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning, but if you want to grab a breakfast sandwich on your way to work keep driving!  If you just want a danish or a muffin you may be ok.  I won't make the mistake of stopping on my way to work again.  The guy in the kitchen literally looked like he was in slow motion, as did the barista.  There was absolutely no sense of urgency from either.  The one exception was the main cashier.  She was busting her tail and you could tell the slowness, and indifference, of the rest of the staff was irritating her and I appreciated that she cared.  When she handed me my breakfast sandwich she apologized and said it shouldn't  have taken as long as it did (15 min.+).  For the $13 price (sandwich, pelligrino water, and tip) I expected Sunflour to have better service.  I pass this location every morning on my way to work, but I'll keep driving and hit Starbucks instead.  I'll reserve Sunflour for those Saturdays and Sundays when I have all the time in the world.",

I ordered one of their cheddar biscuits and asked for it to be warmed up....a process that should have taken five minutes at best since they were quite slow. I waited over 30 minutes and ended up having to ask for a refund and just walk out. The girls working were completely clueless and could not explain what was taking so long and could barely be bothered to apologize. They were completely uninterested in solving the problem and instead just kept looking at me and shrugging when I asked what the hold up was. This place really seems to struggle with providing basic customer service. Only go here if you aren't hungry and have time to kill.",

You can buy chips if you desire. I didn't even eat half of my sandwich and my friend didn't either. Their pastries looked delicious, but we were so turned off by the sandwich that we didn't order anything else. I will never go back for lunch , but may try  a pastry in the future.

Whenever I'm looking for a convenient, sunny spot to meet up with a friend for good eats and decent coffee, this is my go to.   I have been here a few times and each time I am impressed and a bit surprised at how diverse their selection is. Sunflour has a range of soups, sandwiches, and biscuits for a lunch approach and of course, a mouth watering array of pastries, cookies, cakes, and scones. This stop at Sunflour I had a whole wheat raspberry muffin (vegan- they often have a few vegan/ gf options in house) and my best friend had a huge chocolate peanutbutter cookie.   The staff was willing to answer all of our questions and recommended coffee blends. The coffee, however, was just okay. Nothing to write home about. The two baked goods were exactly what we paid for and we were able to sit outside the cafe and enjoy.   Sunflour is clean, has accessible wifi, decent coffee, and good food. The store is a lovely place to bring a friend or hunker down in to get some work done. There seemed to be quite a few business meetings happening in there as well and that seems like a good idea too.   Definitely stop in and check it out if you're in the area!",

They have a single cup, or a 2-3 cup press to share.  The coffee is pretty darn good.  I've had their regular coffee and it's OK.  There are so few places that offer French Press, so big bonus for Sunflour.  Also, their Croissants and biscuits are excellent.  I had the Cheddar Sausage Biscuit which tasted good, but it probably would have been better warm.  Also, they have a lot of great choices at the bar where you make your coffee, like honey sweetener for your iced coffee.  Pretty cool!  The disappointing part was the rest of the food.  So the regular coffee as I mentioned is OK.  Their breakfast sandwiches come on a nice croissant, but if they are busy, you could wait a while for your sandwich to come.  they also use fake egg product, so you're not getting a real egg on the sandwich.  I also do not love their cupcakes.  They look beautiful, but they have always looked better than they tasted.  Overall, pretty good breakfast spot if you're looking to overload on carbs.  Parking can be a bit crazy, so I recommend going early to get a spot.",

I am a regular at the location on 7th Street and I usually order the Avocado Melt on rosemary bread.  It's the perfect blend of avocado, basil, goat cheese, and tomato on fresh delicious bread. As previously mentioned, I love their cupcakes. They are always fresh and they have really food icing.  The nice thing about Sunflour is that the service is typically quick. Most of the tables are pretty small, so they are good for one to four people. You can move the tables around to create space for a larger group is needed. This is a great place to grab quick, good grub, meet up with friends for coffee, read, or study. I will see you soon, Sunflour!",

There were some people in there just having coffee and also using their computers but it wasn't crowded which was great. We did go on a Friday so the crowd could be bigger on weekends. We sampled one of the cupcakes and a chocolate cookie. The cupcake was buttercream frosting which I am usually not a huge fan of but it was very delicious.

I've had scorched, I've had too thin - I have not had a cup that rivaled Julia's, Central, or even Smelly Cat. Sadface. Hopefully this will improve - at close to 2 bucks, you need to show your brew some TLC and appease us snobs.  Decor is airy, clean, modern, lovely, kind of vast for a bakery, and being able to peep into the back kitchen's an awesome touch. Sweetness.",

    "text": "I feel like all the cool Yelp kids have been raving about Sunflour lately so when I got a Saturday 1st meal to myself I decided to pop over and give them a try.   Now perhaps a five star rating is premature based on one scones worth of product testing but holy hosenfeffer, Batman! That blue cheese scone was one of the beat baked goods I've ever eaten: not overly dry, with delicious lumps of cheese still intact, savory but still light and served on an adorable mini baking sheet. I will certainly be back to try their other goodies (raspberry cream cheese crescent, I have my eyes on you).  The experience of visiting Sunflour was as pleasant as the pastry. The space is bright and open. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even have a counter along the window, one of my personal favs, which is great for watching the occasional passerby or just soaking in done early afternoon sun.  I think the ultimate compliment I can give Sunflour is that when I went to the 'Bucks next door afterward their pastry case looked downright unappetizing. Oh no, I know where I can get so much better.",

    "text": "Combining two of the hottest trends in in food right now- artisan baking and local sourcing of ingredients, it seems like Sunflour ought to hit the mark.  In my opinion, it sure does.  This sunny shop is just around the corner from my house, so I had a stop in the other morning for a little breakfast.  Light colored wood tabletops and counters contrast with large photos of fresh foods bursting with color.  You get the concept right away, even without having to read a word- I like that.  A chalkboard overhead and behind the counter tells of that days freshest offerings along with a little info on which of the ingredients are locally made and where the come from.  Breakfast options abound with decadent-looking croissants, plain or chocolate.  There were also a number of muffins and loaf slices.  I opted, though, for an egg sandwich on sliced house-made bread.  You could also opt for a biscuit, but the thought of sesame-semolina bread sounded more interesting to me.    I had to wait for them to make the sandwich, which I didn't mind since it meant I was getting a pre-shaped egg patty that worked its way thru the microwave at some earlier hour.  While I waited, I looked at the many pies and cakes that were making their way out of the kitchen and into the cooler.  I also noticed that they brew Counter Culture coffee and espresso.  Figuring that I'd give Starbucks a break, I had a mocha latte.  Wow was I impressed- their mocha sauce is made in house and it was perfect- not too sweet but not too bland.  No burnt flavor, as some have noticed in the 'Bucks.  Once that was made, my sandwich was also ready I went on my way.  Before leaving, I noticed they also serve a number of deli lunch sandwiches too.  Most sounded really good- banana and nutella?!  Yum.  Ham and gruyere with whole grain mustard?!  Double yum.   I understand they also do wedding cakes- hopefully the wife and I are beyond needing those, but the custom-ordered pies and line of breads coming soon sound like they are worth investigating.     Can't wait to go back- this is a most welcome addition to the neighborhood.",

I have searched high and low for a good pain au chocolat in this town and this place has the best one.  I also tried their sticky bun (amazing!) vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting (a little dense but enjoyable) and the best egg and cheese sandwich on whole grain that I've had. I think the prices are extremely reasonable and the staff friendly.  The lady up front said that they have the biggest selections of baked goods towards the end of the week and that it never hurts to call ahead to see what they have available if you're looking for something in particular.  I definitely recommend checking this place out.  And, chances are, you'll see me there (actually here... I'm at the Sunflour right now -- yes, free wi-fi).

I narrowed down my selections to either a peanut butter blondie (think blonde brownie but made with peanut butter) or the pumpkin whoopee pie.  The girls behind the counter recommended I go with the pumpkin and I was not disappointed.  It was absolutely delicious!  They have a decent sized seating area.  I grabbed a table and read for a bit while enjoying my treat.  There was just enough foot traffic that it wasn't too quiet but it wasn't too loud to distract from my book.  I will definitely be back next time I need to relax and enjoy a treat.  I even feel good about eating unhealthy pastries here since I'm supporting other local businesses (they use as many local ingredients as possible) as well.",

Oh, and a freaking good whoopie pie.   Some folks have commented saying the selection could be better, and yes, I agree, it could be. BUT...I'd much rather have a limited menu with well executed items (moist cupcakes with just enough frosting.  Cookies that are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Whoopie pies that are so rich they make you want to take a nap after) than a case full of stale pastry.   Love the clean light wood interior and the chalkboard menu.

    "text": "Love love LOVE Sunflour Baking Company.  Although everything I have had from there has been excellent, here are a few personal stand outs.  1- The Croissant -- Unbelievably flaky, the entire way through. Not flaky in the first few layers and then fatty-tasting dough like a lot of other croissants I've had in town. It is so light and crisp, you forget there is butter between each layer and get carried away to another place  (cue the classical French music)  2 - The Key Lime pie is the best I have ever had. It is so tart and yet so rich and luxurious that it becomes harmoniously in balance. The texture is also the silkiest I have ever experienced -- almost like there is marscarpone in the filling.  3 - The chocolate dipped coconut macaroons - heaven. The macaroon part is so chewy and gooey and delicious and sweet, while the not-quite-as-sweet chocolate part tames it down and bit and adds a nice roundness to finish out a meal with. These would be perfect for ending a dinner party with a cup of coffee or a little Sauternes.   I always talk about the food first in restaurant reviews because afterall, if the food is outstanding, that's really why we are returning there right? That being said I do love the clean lines and simple design of the bakery itself. It's not too frou-frou or fussy, leaving the treats themselves to be the highlight. Everyone there is always friendly and sweet (he he) and it is definitely, by far, the best all around bakery in Charlotte.",

    "text": "A trip to Amelie's after dinner resulted in spotting a line longer than Kim Kardashian and Britney Spears marriages combined. So what's a bunch of yelpers with a sweet tooth to do? Why pull up our yelp apps and look for alternatives of course. Thus we ended up at Sunflour Baking Company.  The space is light and airy, it really gives off a feeling of cleanliness and you can even see them baking up some concoctions through a window to the kitchen. Very modern, even though I prefer a more cozy setting when chomping down on various sweets and pastries. It just doesn't have that feeling where you want to get some coffee and dessert and hang around to chat you know?  I got a creme brulee while fellow yelper Leanne C. got a morning glory muffin. The creme brulee was rich and creamy, and I liked seeing the dark vanilla seeds sprinkled throughout. However this was more of a pudding consistency than that of a brulee, almost as if it hadn't fully set yet and it was just a bit too sweet for me after a while. I got to taste the morning glory muffin as well and it was excellent if a touch greasy.  The best part about Sunflour was that wasn't a line out the door like Amelie's. I felt like some of the non pastry options were a little expensive for what they were. For now three stars until I can return and make a more accurate assessment. Maybe their late night lineup isn't as good as during other hours?",

There are so many great things to say about it... the cupcakes are to die for (particularly the key lime, yum!) but after three visits, I'm noticing more and more \"flaws\" in the perfect bakery experience.  The Good: -Key Lime Cupcakes -Perfectly toasted sourdough bread on the sandwiches -Key Lime Cupcakes!!!!! -Some of the best egg salad I've ever had -CUPCAKES. -Friendly, amazing staff and patrons.  The Bad: -OLIVES in the pimiento cheese.  The bread was perfectly toasted.  The pimieno cheese WOULD have been perfect, but there were olives in it.  I HATE OLIVES.  If you are going to put something so non-traditional in a standard like pimiento cheese, PLEASE warn the customers.  Especially when many (like me!) have olive aversions.  The Ugly: -AMERICAN CHEESE, which is hardly CHEESE considering what it's made of (oil and god only knows what?) on the breakfast sandwich.  At a place like Sunflour, to put a slice of that disgusting product on a homemade croissant is just blasphemy.  I was so disappointed in my croissant breakfast sandwich.  First, it was american cheese, secondly, the farm fresh \"egg\" resembled... I don't even know what.  An egg mcmuffin egg is more realistic, and that's not a good sign.  Honestly, the $4.50 breakfast croissant was a huge disappointment, and hardly edible... the bread was a bit over cooked and dried out, the egg was a gross patty, and the cheese.  Oh, the cheese.  Give me real cheese.  Swiss. Cheddar.  SOMETHING. But not American.  I will be returning to my regular breakfast spots (bagels or breakfast burritos) and stick to Sunflour for lunch and cupcakes!",

With any good retailer this wouldn't have been a question.",

I had it as part of an egg sandwich,  which combined cheddar, spinach leaves, roasted tomato, and mounds of fresh avocado.  Absolutely terrific!",

I try to support local business and really wanted to like this place, but in the 6-7 times I have been there I have yet to feel like they haven't seen me as a burden on their day. I don't know what it is - it may be because I usually have my well mannered 2 year old daughter with me and they aren't overly kid friendly. They don't have highchairs and claim it is because of some restaurant code (I go to restaurants, I see high chairs...). I have had other friends with and without kids in the neighbor share similar experiences . I just heard they implemented a no stroller policy (not confirmed).   I don't want kids screaming and running around when I am eating either, but address it if and when it happens and don't have a smarmy sign up that says unattended kids will be given espresso.  Other than that:  Nice clean design, they added a couch and some comfy chairs recently, I think that helped.   Their sandwiches are lacking, but I really like their chocolate croissants and pop tart knockoffs - almost gave them 2 stars for the croissants, but can't get past the lack of customer service.   Coffee is not great, but they do sell the Cokes that Earthfare sells as Mexican Coke - I think it has real sugar as opposed to high fructose corn syrup - that is good, but I can get that at Earthfare.",

I got an egg and cheese on sourdough for myself, an egg on cheese on multi-grain for my boyfriend, a cup of coffee, and a ginger carrot cake cupcake for the road.  The coffee was just right - strong and rich.  (Nice to have an option besides Starbucks : )  The bread used for the sandwiches was excellent.  My one \"eh\" moment ?  The cheese on the egg sandwiches seemed to be American.  When all the other ingredients are such high quality, the cheese should match.    The cupcake an hour into the trip was AWESOME! I I couldn't get enough of the frosting, which strayed in the best of ways away from the standard carrot cake cream cheese.  This seemed to be a citrus butter creme.  The cake itself was light and moist.  I will definitely return here.  Great atmosphere.  If you're looking for a place to spend some time doing work, chatting with a friend, or just stopping in, try Sunflour. The decor is beautiful.  Very clean, elegant, calming.  And the food is tasty.  I look forward to trying their \"fig newtons\" and \"pop tarts\" in the future.",

It's a cute place with lots of natural light, and on my way to the bathroom, there was a window where you could see into the kitchen, which was a nice touch.   I ordered the mixed berry scone, and my bf ordered the egg, spinach, cheese, tomato on a cheese biscuit. The scone was great. It was still a little warm when I was eating it. I loved how crunchy it was on the outside and soft on the inside. I did notice it was a little greasy on my fingers, but I ate it quickly enough that it wasn't that much of an issue.   My boyfriend's biscuit sandwich was good. However, my bf doesn't eat bacon at all, so it came as a surprise to find bacon bits all throughout his biscuit. It would've been nice if it was described as a bacon cheddar biscuit, so for the few of you non-bacon eaters out there, there is bacon in this biscuit. For bacon-lovers, go to town.",

I have no self-control when it comes to fresh out the oven muffins or brownies so good the taste stays with you all day.   Perhaps one of my favorite new spots in Elizabeth, SBC boasts organic produce from around the area and makes muffins, sandwiches, poptarts, cupcakes and other delectables that are just a pure treat for the tongue. I'm not over-exaggerating at all.   I hit this place up every weekend for their breakfast sandwich which I get on a fresh cheddar biscuit. There are always people hanging out in here and everyone walks out that place with a huge smile on their dial. I've tried just about everything (brownies, cupcakes, poptarts, granola, muffins, ham and cheese croissants, cinnamon buns, the list goes on).   They're open Tuesday-Sunday and an absolute MUST STOP if you are living in or visiting the Elizabeth area. At first I tried to hide this place from others but apparently word go out.",

One thing I was really impressed with was the latte I had. I honestly didn't expect the it to be good. Whatever espresso they use was had great flavor!  They used a great blend of white chocolate with it.  So many places turn a latte in a syrup drink which I hate so props to these guys!

Upon entering the restaurant I noticed that the location wasn't large however there was a decent amount of seating for small groups.   The menu was somewhat overwhelming (or busy) for a first timer and I kind of felt pressured to quickly order or move out the way, so I ordered the Egg, Bacon, and Cheese Croissant Sandwich since it seems the Croissants had good reviews. I waited at one of the tables while my food was prepared and then my order was called for pick up. I had another appointment to go to, so I didn't eat inside.   As soon as I got in my car I couldn't resist biting into the sandwich and my oh my. The croissant was flaky, buttery, and oh so good. I could have just eaten the croissant by itself and been a happy camper. The croissant itself was huge and the egg and bacon was tasty as well. I don't know if I've had a better croissant. I will definitely go back to try out a few other menu options and of course the croissant. Did I say try the croissants?",

I paid $12.18 for two items. Not only that, the cupcakes are around $3.25 plus tax. Nevertheless the staff is nice, the place is clean, and the food is good. The coffee is very strong and bitter but its organic and they offer caramel and other things to sweeten your coffee for an additional charge. Only thing I would say is, make sure you have enough money for this place, as it is not for the broke. Lol",

The muffin was delicious - the perfect balance of crisp on top, moist throughout.   Their staff is very friendly. They seem to be running a well-streamlined operation. They have the iPad system, which is definitely the fastest in my experience.   I'm looking forward to being a regular here and trying out all of their delicious baked goods!",

    "text": "I chose Sunflour after searching yelp for vegan dessert options in Charlotte. I was meeting a friend for coffee and thought it would be a great place to have options that fit both of our diets.   I ended up ordering the vegan banana chocolate chip muffin and he opted for one of their butter breads gussied up with avocado, pimento cheese and tomato.  We both ordered their teas to drink. I had the tangerine ginger.   The vegan muffin was absolutely fabulous. So good in fact, that I thought to myself,  \"Is this really vegan?\" Even though all the signage said so and it was the only banana chocolate chip muffin that they served. If you order this be sure to have it warmed up. I did and I think it made all the difference. I'm also not a fan of the cold muffin anyway  so I could be a bit biased. The chocolate chips were perfectly gooey and the muffin was deliciously moist and pillowy. It had the perfect ratio of banana to chocolate just like a good banana bread. Which is something that I've missed first to due to my tree nut allergy an then to my vegan diet. But this glorious muffin made up for it all.    The tangerine Ginger tea was super refreshing. I'm a huge fan of ginger and thought it had the perfect amount of ginger in it. Love that they served it in its own mini glass pot with a glass of ice to pour it over.   Best of all was the service! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and able to speak to the availability of vegan options and provide spot on suggestions! This will definitely be a place I regularly visit. So glad to have found it! Thanks yelpers!!!",

This bright, inviting shop has a great variety of baked goods on offer, along with breakfast sandwiches and coffee and tea beverages. Food is ordered at the counter and you receive a number to place at your table so the server can find you when it's ready.  Their croissants are incredibly flaky and buttery and stand on their own or complement their hearty breakfast sandwich options. We enjoyed their egg, cheddar and ham sandwiches this way.  The blueberry croissant has a generous portion of fruit laid atop all of the flaky goodness. Scones are not overly sweet and have an excellent texture as well.  The coffee and chai tea lattes are top notch and go well with the food items.  This place looks like it stays busy, with a mix of diners and laptop users filling the tables. Parking could get a bit tight here with all of the traffic but it is worth the trouble to find a spot to visit this cafe. Highly recommended.",

They're one of the few (if not the only) bakeries to make their own croissants from scratch. (Amelie's sells Sysco croissants!?) Boy can you tell.

Now, I'd like to give them a better rating than A-OK. They're open fairly late, which is  alone worth major bonus points, and their baked goods are delicious. I especially recommend the magic bar. Furthermore, while they seem steadily busy, they don't get nearly as crowded as, say Amelie's does. So, why only 3 stars for Sunflour?  They stop brewing coffee at 6pm. That might seem like a petty reason to dock a star, but at least for me, coffee and dessert go hand-in-hand. Lattes are available, but who wants to drink a latte with a slice of cake? That's overkill. It seems to me that if I were open and selling dessert until 9 or 10 at night, I'd keep the coffee brewing!",

So one sunny morning (or, as some people like to call it, late afternoon) I took myself out for some breakfast.   I'm all for supporting local, and it paid off because my scone was delicious. I had to stop myself from ordering one of everything, but the giant muffins are definitely on my To-Eat list. The coffee was eh, ok, but considering it was like 4 pm I can let that one slide. It wasn't horrible, just wasn't a fresh pot. (I know, 4 pm. Some of us drink coffee then.)  If I could change anything, I would swap out some tables for a few more couches. The little couch section looked so homey, but sadly they were all taken.   This is just walking distance from my new digs, and I'll be bribing myself with treats after a walk in the future.",

    "text": "I came to this place as part of the Good Eats & Meets Foodie Crawl last night. Our stops were Kennedy's, Chateau D'ough (not open to the public) and Sunflour. When we first stepped in I wasn't impressed by the decor and the IKEA looking furniture/cabinets they had.  The first thing I noticed the nice selection of craft beer they had, so immediately things were looking up for me since it was around 10:30PM. Their wine, tea and coffee selections are really good too. Part of the Crawl included a behind the scenes tour of the bakery. IMPRESSIVE! Their large kitchen is fantastic and they had a string of treats for us to try.  First we had some sample of random chocolate little treats which were all delicious. The cheesecake brownies were out of this world. Then we got a nice spiel on their Croissants. I wasn't a big Croissant fan... until now. Apparently they are the ONLY bakery in the Charlotte area and one of the few in the entire Southeast to make their Croissants from scratch... which is a three day process. We had their dark-chocolate-filled Croissants and I was hooked.  Their standard coffee, which is all I had, was excellent. It was a nice medium roast, very smooth and silky.  I also love the fact that, whenever possible, they support local businesses and farms. I love that!  I've been to Nova and Amelie's and all those places... they're good. Sunflour, blows them right out of the water. I am a fan!",

Sandwiches come with nothing and saw nothing on menu that shows you can add chips etc .  My daughter did have a cupcake which was decent but not anything special . Left disappointed and still hungry .",

    "text": "Sunflour's sandwiches are flavorful and fresh, the tea selection is extensive and I always find their teas to be of great quality (Not to mention they give you your on French Press which you can allow to steep as long as you please!).   The coffee is decent ( although more options for add ins for customers, such as soy and different sugars would be great, considering the local/ organic propaganda all over the place). They also have some unique and delicious breads and pastries (We love the orange hazelnut croissant and the cupcakes are fantastic).   Despite all this, I go here very infrequently solely because every time I do, I am guaranteed a disgruntled and unhappy cashier and extremely slow service. I've worked in the food biz for longer than I'd like to admit, so I know that dealing with Uppity Elizabeth customers can be taxing, but that's no excuse for the negative attitudes consistently encountered in the employees. In my opinion a more helpful and friendly staff is the only thing standing between Sunflour and becoming a beloved staple of the Elizabeth community.  EDIT: After about 6 months, extensive additions to the menu and a new front of house crew, this place has earned my approval.",

Unfortunately, every time after that first time, they never seem to have it. Maybe it's that good. My wife is celiac, so she needs to eat gluten free. Every once in a while she'll cheat for something worth getting sick over. This key lime pie is worth it to her.  Today's visit, we struck out again. No key lime pie. My wife instead got me a tiramisu, that was very moist and full of flavor. A delicious dessert. She bought a panna cotta for herself which she said was not very good.  I guess we will start calling before making the drive to sunflour from now on. Because that key lime is firmly on our radar",

This place has that mom and pop feel for sure.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is I find it a bit pricey!  Today's selection was a egg salad sammy on toasted rosemary bread with lettuce and grilled tomato.  It was great but I'm not sure $6.75 great.  Some sammies cost as much as $9 or more.    Their coffee is good and they offer pour overs, french milled and traditional.  Today I had the peach blossom white tea with a smidge of honey!  Yum.  Of the 3 I have visited (all but the one in Ballantyne) this seems smaller than the Harrisburg location but bigger than the Dillworth location.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating.  Bathrooms are always tidy too.  Parking is hit and miss - it all depends on the timing.  We went today around 11 and found a spot right away but closer to noon ....well.... you take your chances.  LOL  Next time I plan to try a cupcake as they look divine.    It's the spot for casual convo; a lite business meet; out of office work location since they offer free WiFi or anything else where you want a casual comfy environment.    Thanks Sunflour...until next time.  :)",

As soon I walked in, I saw the display case of all the pastries/desserts and they were traying out a fresh new batch of 6 delightful cinnamon rolls. Made a sin-ful decision and absolutely could not resist getting the Cin. The roll was so soft and the cream cheese icing was outstanding. Easily one of the best Cin's I've ever had. Impatiently bit into it prior to snapping a picture, it was that good. There wasn't a whole lot of cinnamon taste to it, but it sure was dang delicious. The Apple turnover was all right, but it's all about the CIN.",

    "text": "Yes, yes, yes, yes, and YES! It has been a very long time since I've \"wow\"-ed while eating breakfast or lunch, but on two visits Sunflour managed it both times! Darling, charming store with a handful of locations throughout Charlotte, this Bakery & Cafe is one of those places you'll want to take your out-of-town friends when they think there's no 'soul' in Charlotte eateries!  This place is similar to Amelie's in it's uniqueness but with their own spin on things. Think of a traditional French Bakery but with a bit of Southern flair added in. The breakfast options range from croissants to muffins to hearty breakfast biscuit sandwiches. The classics like a Bacon Egg & Cheese can be ordered on Sourdough, Whole Grain, Rolls, or (my favorite) a CHEDDAR biscuit. Why emphasize cheddar? Because it's grand, that's why! Don't set up an appointment with your cardiologist the day you're going to visit here, this thing is heavy and full of all the good stuff like fat and calories; you'll want to take a nap afterwards.  If you do happen to start dozing off after your giant breakfast sandwich, their lineup of Pure Intentions & Counter Culture Coffee will get you rollin' on out of there. Everything from regular Coffee, to Lattes, Espresso, Cold Brew, even Hot Chocolate. I haven't had Tea here but the list is impressive with all kinds of offerings, something tells me they know what they're doing with the Tea as well.  That Southern BLT, tho... Boys & Girls, I'm not a huge advocate for BLT sandwiches, but if you add pimento cheese to something I'm probably going to come shuffling in! Fabulously fresh from the bread to the veggies. The pimento actually keeps the tomato from getting the toasted bread all soggy, which is probably something you didn't even know was a problem before, until you get to the last bite of this fantastic sandwich and realize, it was just as good as the first bite! The bacon is really thick too, which is always a plus.  Their seasonal menu is just that, a whole MENU, not just one or two add-ons. Check it out for all kinds of limited-time goodies. Right now they have a panini with prosciutto, roasted peaches, and a balsamic glaze that I have my eye on for next time.  This place has won my regular business anytime I'm in the Elizabeth neighborhood. Look up your closest Sunflour location and drive, bike, run, or crawl, pronto!",

The vegan banana chocolate chip muffin is also delicious. One thing i wasn't a huge fan of was the vegan cupcake. The cake itself was a little thick and heavy and not very moist. The frosting, however was delicious. I ate the top and threw the rest away.  I've also had the chickpea curry salad sandwich on rosemary bread, which was tasty. One thing I'd mention is that the sandwich is described as having grapes, sunflower seeds and other things in it, and that's all blended together to create a spread. So don't be surprised when you get a sandwich that appears to just be chickpeas and arugula like i was.",

I was eating on the way back to work and it felt & tasted like it was sitting out for 20 minutes even though I know it was freshly made.  I'm definitely going to give this place a try again and will update my review based on that! The staff was friendly and the place was really cute.",

I stumbled upon Sunflour Baking Company. I ordered ahead trying to be super ahead of the game and just have the items delivered, but ended up picking the wrong delivery date(a week too late) So I called and spoke to Janet; and honestly she went out of her way to get me my order today instead of next week and also refunded me the delivery fee i paid because i ended up just picking them up. The cake jars were a hit everyone loved them. The quality and flavor of the cake was outstanding.

    "text": "Love this little spot!  It's perfect for a weekend breakfast.  The giant cinnamon rolls are my favorite!  Mostly because I am a giant #manchild.    The breakfast sandwiches are also amazing.  Fresh proteins, avocado, etc.  You get your choice of wheat, sourdough, amazing croissants, or wicked cheddar biscuits.  I've tried a couple of the lunch sandwich options and many of the fresh pastries as well, and I have never been disappointed.  My family from Virginia is now hooked and requests that we pay this place a visit every time they are in town.  My daughter asks for her own cinnamon roll every weekend now too.  I have to bribe her to eat some \"real\" breakfast first.  This never goes over well.    Coffee options are available as well.  My go to is the French press.  Don't forget to join their loyalty program if you plan to return.  Parking and seating can be a bit of a challenge on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but the lot and the tables tend to turn quickly.  It's also a great spot to walk to if you live nearby.    Another reason I love this place is because the pastries (including the cinnamon rolls, of course) are great for meetings or office pick-me-ups.  I love walking into the office with a box of four giant cinnamon rolls and seeing my staff's faces light up.  Try it!  You'll be the hero of your office!  Just be warned, they do occasionally sell out.",

The cake was moist with a peanut butter filling and dark chocolate frosting--super sweet, but I like it like that.  I had a veggie sandwich, avocado, goat cheese, tomato on focaccia that was delicious, but could have used a little more sauce. Then I had a dirty mocha with soy milk that was delicious.  Loved my first visit and will be back again soon. (Wifi was okay, you have to get the password to make it work smoothly.) Great space to visit or have some quiet time and do work!",

There was no problem when I ordered but the message was never relayed. As I was watching and knowing I wouldn't get the larger cup with a dabble of extra milk. I approached the counter and asked them if it were mine and they said yes. I asked if I could get more milk and a larger cup she said we only make lattes in one size...alright I get get there's standards but you only have small and medium so I asked again can I please have a larger cup with milk because a triple shot is a lot to handle when you're drinking a small.  She then proceeds to grab the cup turn around and pour it into a larger mug (no extra milk) and hands it to me like I'm an idiot and don't realize it's the same frigin latte. I normally praise this place and eat here often but that was ridiculous.     Oh and I've ordered plenty of lattes there with extra milk and paid extra for it. It was dead in there this time and no excuse for this. I'm disappointed.",

    "text": "Preface: Sunflour has recently found itself under new ownership so I waited to write this review until I went back a few times.   Review: I am very conflicted with Sunflour right now. I loved this bakery for their sandwiches, the treats, the coffee, and definitely the laid back but adorable atmosphere. They have Counter Culture coffee, which I really enjoy, so the coffee is a great draw. Their treats still seems to look good - they have a great array of cupcakes (the Carrot Cake is fantastic but there are some I still need to try!), many types of muffins (the Morning Glory is holy), and other types of treats from whoopie pies, cake, pie, tarts, cinnamon buns, cheddar biscuits, croissants, scones, and basically anything else a great bakery should have.   They have great options for breakfast and lunch sandwiches; I am a fan of their 'TAB' (turkey, avocado, bacon). They also have this Rosemary Sourdough bread that is, for seriousness, off the chain. I always want to buy it to take home but I know for a fact I would eat it in one sitting with zero hesitation; so I refrain.   Clearly, I enjoy their food. However, the food is nothing if the service behind it is not up to par. I don't know what is happening, and I made sure I came twice over a decent amount of time under new ownership to let them work out their kinks, but the service has become extremely below average. The place always had a slower pace, and even though I'm an instant gratification person, I accepted it and enjoyed it for what it was because it was still reasonable.  The second to last time my boyfriend and I came, we ordered two sandwiches and one coffee, and we could tell the girl behind the counter was not focusing and I was already preparing for a slip up. Well, 10 minutes later, no coffee, she caught me looking and literally gasped \"oh no!\" She brought us two coffees and said \"I am so sorry I forgot.\" Meh. Strike one but thank you for the extra coffee. 15 minutes after that (so 25 minutes after ordering) we still had not gotten our sandwiches and noticed plenty of others had. Finally we mentioned it to a different person at the counter and they were legitimately surprised, realized they were never ordered (strike two), had our sandwiches instantly made and brought out to us. We were annoyed but just happy to have our food. To our surprise, the man at the counter told the manager who came out, spoke to us, apologized, explained the new ownership and employees, refunded us our meal and gave us additional coffees. I was very impressed with their acknowledgment and amends to the mistake. We ate our food and chalked it up to a bad day.   We came back again this afternoon, to a pretty empty bakery (maybe two or three other people), ordered two sandwiches and two coffees. We got our coffees quickly (a little burnt but not ruined), then our sandwiches came out. Mine was not as ordered (stroke three) so I asked them to please fix the sandwich. They apologized (the sandwich maker missed the line of what to leave out), and brought out a new one. It was again not as ordered (strike four), so I brought it back up, she apologized again, offered a free cookie, and brought it back out again as ordered.   Epilogue: All in all, the food is still good but this place has dwindled quite a bit in my book and clearly has a lot of kinks to work out with the communication from front to back of house. Four me, four strikes is enough to hesitate returning back here, which truly makes me very sad.",

    "text": "Oh my stars another delicious bakery! Thank goodness, because God forbid I have to travel a mile outside of Elizabeth to fetch a delicious treat.   I was really intrigued by Sunflour as soon as I read that they were opening. It's a (pun intended) sunny bakery filled with tasty treats, coffee, a smattering of tables and smiling faces. Right now they are focusing on their baked goods, but in time expect to see them crank out artisan breads and gourmet sandwiches, too.   On my first visit I went with a recommendation, one of their special baked goods of the day - a pumpkin whoppee pie. ZOMG. Two delicate, flavorful and delicious pumpkin cake-muffin-hybrid sandwiched with a generous layer of cream cheese frosting goodness. It was fabulous. I also enjoyed a decaf vanilla latte that was oh so frothy. Yum.  One of my favorite things about Sunflour, though, is that they focus on using local & regional ingredients. On their website, their menus and their chalkboards they tell the customers where their flour, eggs and coffee all come from. With these amazing baked goods, eager to please staff and charming nature, Sunflour may be one of my new faves in Elizabeth.",

We went because a friend of ours got a job there and we wanted to check it out and support him in his new state of employment.    Housed in a nondescript strip shopping center in the Elizabeth neighborhood, the interior was very pleasing, comfortable, and unpretentious.  There was just the right amount of hustle and bustle to make things seem busy and cheerful without being overpowering.  Nothing too cute or faux shabby chic about this place, just perfect baked goods and coffee.  Unless you regularly travel to Paris, this is the place you need to go for the best croissant you have ever taken into your mouth.  We had the ham and Gruyere, and a chocolate one for dessert.  I only have one word...wow.  Flaky, crispy, buttery and heavenly.  They are not to be missed.  Coffee was superb and the cappuccino was perfectly prepared, rich, dark espresso with a magnificent thick head of expertly frothed milk.    We took a slice of carrot cake to go and ate it later at home.  It didn't disappoint either.  very moist, not too sweet, and obviously made with stellar, fresh ingredients and lots of love for their customers.  I can't wait to go back and \"blow\" my diet out of the water next weekend.",

    "text": "I wanted to fall in love with Sunflour so badly.  I love local bakeries, I love places that use locally sourced ingredients, and I LOVE cupcakes.  This place, based on all the Yelp reviews, seemed like the perfect place for me.  I stopped by when I was in the neighborhood, and I was so disappointed!  I tried a caramel cupcake--vanilla cake with a caramel filling and caramel icing.  And it was one of the worst cupcakes I've ever had.  It is rare that I pay $3.25 cents for a cupcake and throw half of it away, but that is exactly what I did.  The icing had a good flavor, but there wasn't a lot of it.  The carmel ribbon inside the cupcake was so thin that I only tasted it in a bite or two (and I take small bites when savoring something so sweet), and it had seemed to drip down to the bottom, where the bottom of the cupcake was soggy.  The big problem, however, was the cake.  The cake was so dense--wasn't light or fluffy at all--that I could barely eat it.  It felt like I was eating a pound cake--not a cupcake.  The flavor was okay--not too strong on the vanilla.  I think I will go back and try something else and update my review accordingly, because I honestly don't believe that I ate at the same place that all of these folks raved about.  Maybe there was just an off batch or something.  I like the idea of Sunflour so much that I had to give it to stars, but the cupcake would be 1 in my book.",

Well addicted I may get ....to Sunflour not JS. I finally got to try this place out and was pleased with it! It's a very simple and clean store with lots of natural light coming through. Their menu and setup though? Holy baked goodness! They had just about everything a person with a sweet tooth could wish for--cakes, cookies, cupcakes, truffles, scones, pies, pop tarts, fig newtons and you get the picture. They had a pretty sweet coffee selection as well and their Americano knocked my socks off! It was smooth and bold as an Americano should be. I tried the Chocolate Creme Pie with the help of Miss Tonya P and the crust tasted like it had a stick of butter it in which is A-OK in my book. The creme was whipped deliciousness but the whipped cream wasn't as fresh as I expected, it tasted a bit stale.   But it's all good, I will definitely be back to Sunflour for more java and sweet treat and to support a local business. Banana and Nutella sandwich.....I'm looking at you, you will get in my belly!",

    "text": "My favorite bakery in Charlotte!  Sunflour truly has a piece of my heart I do not say this lightly. I luckily have the privilege of living only a mile away from here and is one of my usual weekend breakfast spots. This place takes simple and traditional baking to a whole new level. Not only are the pastries delicious, but this bakery has a very friendly staff and a sweetheart of an owner who has always done her best make my experience pleasant. My only complaint is that I wish they had longer hours (at least on weekends) to complete with some of the other local (and inferior) bakeries.",

The atmosphere is cozy and clean, the employees are helpful and seem HAPPY, and my personal favorite (other than the AMAZING pastries ---which, by the way, have always been the case here) THEY ARE NOW OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK!!!  I no longer have to come on a Monday (which for some reason was so often when I seemed to want pastry???) only to find it closed!!!  Also, I really love the customer contact and appreciation venues.  Those who used to come and stopped and you who have never come here....this is THE BEST BAKERY IN CHARLOTTE!!!  And I take my pastry very seriously because I don't spend those calories without careful consideration....",

The croissant were amazing - flaky, buttery, decadent and delicious.  I can honestly say it was the best croissant I've had in the U.S.  -  The staff.  Friendly and helpful. -  POS system.  I loved getting my receipts emailed to me (great for expense reports!)  The Average: o  The panini press sandwiches were decent, but after tasting the baked goods, why order a sandwich? o  The coffee.  The drip coffee was good, but not astounding.  The latte was also A-OK, but the foam was a bit limp and the coffee tasted a touch burned.  With that said, it was completely satisfying.  Overall a solid 4 stars and I look forward to visiting again!",

The owner was incredibly rude upon a simple inquiry on a 15+ minute delay on the food, getting aggressive and loud when a simple \"sorry let me check on that\" would have been enough. Her answer when questioning her attitude and asking not to raise her voice at us since we were calm? \"This is a cafe, not a restaurant\". Ive eaten here many times and the food if good, I just cant support Ms.Parrish and her rudeness. Single worst experience Ive had in this town.  UPDATE: In response to owner's response. I didn't deal with any server. I dealt with the manager who is writing the response. Checked on an order that took 15 minutes and she raised her voice at me. I never shouted, never insulted. She came to my table and raised her voice, questioning me why I thought it was ok to check on an order that had taken 15 minutes. I had never seen anything like this from somebody who owns a place. A simple rational response to my inquiry would have suffice, and she turned it into an argument and started yelling.",

However, we were greeted with smiles and gentle dispositions.  I love the sign that says, \"unattended children will be given espresso and a free puppy.\"  But, this did not stop the running and screaming of two chaps as their adoring grandparents looked on. We got the cheddar cheese biscuits.  Yummmmm-eee!  My husband claims to be a scone tasting expert and loves the dense texture of Nova's, so he tried a chocolate chip scone from Sunflour.  The consistency was more like a sweet biscuit from one of the fast food joints. I ordered a decaf coffee and was pleasantly surprised to get a latte.  I don't know if it was caffeinated or not, but it was so good that I wasn't complaining. This place had tables and chairs on the sidewalk so that we could escape the espresso filled, runner-screamer children.  I hope that their grandparents read this review and get a hint! Nice change of pace from our usual haunt.",

I don't drink coffee, and generally I don't drink tea, but this drink is amazing! They make it so creamy and delicious, it's worth getting even on a hot day.  The blueberry croissant (really more like an open tartlet), the cheddar biscuit with basically anything on it, the Avocado melt, and the Ham & Gruyere croissant are all delicious, and are \"must-haves\" in my humble opinion.  Don't plan on coming here at peak hours for Saturday/Sunday brunch, or you'll be standing in line a looooong time ---- insider tip is to check it out for a late mid-afternoon lunch, or go really early on a Saturday.

Atmosphere (sun shining through the windows, clean interior, chill environment).   Mini-points -They added Splenda (in 2012 I included this on my wish list!)  -love the window down the hall that shows \"baking in progress\" -love the tea (no tea bags here, just leaves!) Try the coconut oolong- it's my favorite.  -Carmel cupcake is a must try  And ONE big thing! They have become consistent with their hours of operation! There are new owners and they have been consistent with hours, friendly service and expanding the market...they may bring back wine and add in beer and they feature the work of local artists once a month.   This is a great place to work from, bring out of town friends to and indulge on a regular Tuesday.",

I'm an advocate of their orange hazelnut rolls (you heard me) and cinnamon rolls. Vegan friends can usually find a couple options. You can find their Sunflour's twist on a few classics, like fig newtons!   Their cupcakes are rich and decadent. You'll find a variety of things no matter your mood or time of day, from cheese biscuits to Rolo cupcakes to breakfast sandwiches.  As far as their drinks go, I haven't had anything that's wow-ed me yet. You don't go here for consistency when you're getting coffee - a vanilla latte will taste different depending on who made the drink. I'm okay with that variety, but others who tend to order one thing and have expectations might be irked by this.   I have a hard time finding outlets, so this isn't a place where I do work. Most tables are for 2 people, although there's some wiggle room to move tables together.   On your way to the bathrooms, you can check out what the bakers are up to in the back! Very cool to see them do their work. If I make eye contact with someone working, I'll get a smile in return.  Looking for a place that's open later? Look elsewhere - Sunflour closes at 7 PM most days, 4 PM on Sundays.",

    "text": "Finally made my way over to sunflour baking company!  My motivation was their cupakes but the fact that they are known for making everything from scratch and use only the finest, freshest ingredients was certainly an added incentive.  I tried the egg salad sandwich which was on homemade bread.  The bread was really what made this sandwich so tasty.  The egg salad itself was truthfully a little bland.  I wouldn't order it again.  My friend tried the bacon egg and cheese and was very pleased.    the cupcake I tried was ROLO.  It was a dark chocolate cupcake with a dark chocolate buttercream and a rolo melted in on the top.  It was VERY good, but super rich.  It was bitter and had a heavy cocoa flavor.  The caramel from the rolo cut the bitterness a little but this cupcake would never be accused of being too sweet.  The cake part was so moist it was almost wet.  It was phenomenal.  The icing was extremely creamy and almost melted off the cupcake.   I found out they use all dark chocolate/bittersweet chips for their baking to keep things a bit healthier.  I can certainly appreciate that and I think had I known that beforehand I would have known what to expect from the flavor.  It was unique in a lot of ways.  It was a dense and heavy cupcake but very good and I look forward to trying some of their other flavors!  4 stars.  I think they are a little overpriced and there aren't a ton of menu items.  I didn't think the crew behind the counter was very friendly either so I wasn't impressed from that point of view.  I probably wouldn't come back for a sandwich but I will be back for more cupcake exploring.",

They close at 7pm and we arrived 30min before the closing time, but they literally close. Doesn't mater if you are in there eating, they will ask you to leave and eat outside. I worked in two restaurants before and even though we closed at a certain time, we were never allowed to ask people that were already inside eating, to grab their stuff and finish eating outside. That's just so rude! It was raining outside and my friend and I had to stand there to finish eating. It just made my first visit a bad experience and I'm sure never going back there ever again.",

There is always just one person taking orders and one cooking. I have stopped here on my way to work and it takes about 15 mins to get your sandwich if you walk in with no wait.",

It's like a big Red Lobster Biscuit minus the garlic sauce on top, I wouldn't order this again unless I get it in a sandwich and splatter some sauce on there. I really enjoyed the macaroons from here, huge and fresh, especially the salted caramel. I'm a little disappointed to find their chai tea latte is made with the ready made Oregon Chai chai tea concentrate that's even available at Walmart.. You can literally make the exact same thing at home in 2 seconds for a fraction of the cost. I've also gotten a day old rolo cupcake for 50% off, so good even after a day. I'll come back here just for those rolo cupcakes and macaroons...maybe a croissant too.",

Coffee was delicious as well and it was nice a hot. I appreciate things like that - I hate adding cream to my coffee and all of a sudden my coffee is room temperature....know what I mean? I also couldn't resist and ended up getting a chocolate peanut butter cupcake..I inhaled that thing. Can't even describe how good it was.
