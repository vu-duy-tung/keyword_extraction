    "text": "My experience today for dinner was horrible. I've been coming here frequently for the past couple of months getting the tilapia fillet sandwich with hush puppies and fries. I was expecting to enjoy dinner with my family but nope! Waited in the lobby for a seat for about 5 minutes, just to be seated and wait another 20 minutes. Got the attention of someone who works there to see if we were going to be served or not, then the server decides to turn around and ask what we would like to drink. This took another 5 minutes just to make 1 sweet tea and 2 sprites. Im a server as well and I know how hard it is to keep up with multiple tables but when you are just walking around slowly with nothing in your hand, it gives off the impression that you dont care about your tables. We asked for silverware and did not get any until we had to ask the server again once our food came out. They were clearly understaffed but I did not expect to be this disappointed. The food was another issue. I asked for a salt and peppered sandwich but all i tasted was pepper. I wrote a nice little list of what was disappointing on the back of the ticket, so hopefully the server will take that into consideration. I will just stick to coming here during the day time. The service is usually great and the food is as well.",

I have been looking for a alternative to having to go to Captain D's. It is right in the area and have a great take out menu also. More than just fried seafood, I get the take out fish platter and they give generous portions, great food at a great price. Also have a broiled menu for ppl with diet plans and have a full menu of different types of foods. I am a fan. My son is Autistic and a picky eater he loved it and he was FULL! Anyone out their with a teenage boy knows what I mean! Great place!",

    "text": "This place has really improved over the last few years, and it's a staple with the folks at the neighboring offices.  I believe they brought in new management a few years ago and it's made a WORLD of difference in both service and quality of food.  Unfortunately I'm a fan of fried (yah, I know) popcorn shrimp and Alaskan whitefish, and they prepare both beautifully here, in traditional \"fish camp\" style.  They really shine at lunch time, where daily specials are around FIVE BUCKS and you get dinner-size portions!  They do have broiled options, but those aren't available as lunch specials (however they're still priced reasonably).  One thing I like about them is that they're flexible.  This means that you don't HAVE to get fries with your meal; you can opt for a baked potato if you prefer and they don't say anything or get confused as some places do.  Or you can get double fries/no hush puppies...whatever works for YOU, not them.  I think one of their star options is the \"family pack\" they offer.  This has got to be one of THE best deals in town, especially when trying to feed a family at dinner.  You get a TON of food for $27 & change (including tax!).   For under thirty dollars you get your choice of TWO seafood options (ie two lbs of baby shrimp and eight pieces of flounder), a very large box of hush puppies, and a very large box of fries or four baked potatoes.  You also get a TUB each of cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and cole slaw.  Plenty of food for a family of 2-4.  OH - you also get a half gallon of tea.  Service here is always speedy and friendly as well, and that has a lot to do w/the change in management I believe.  I worked in the neighboring office for many years & for a while a few years ago we actually boycotted them for quite some time BECAUSE of their service.  But now they're wonderful!  Orders are always correct and on time (especially important when time is of the essence), and the employees are always super friendly and accommodating, and seem genuinely interested in making sure your experience is the best it can be.  Harbor Inn - a great option for traditional seafood in the University City area.",

I did order some salt n pepper fried Alaskan Whitefish (asked to have it salt n pepper as it wasn't listed as an option like the other items). That wasn't a problem. Good service, the place was very clean compared to other \"fish camp style places\" and condiment squeeze bottles were not greasy or caked with dried tarter sauce. It was a good place and I would go back. The only regret is they don't have Lobster or shrimp scampi on the menu, but other than that a winner with excellent prices. Very reasonable.",

    "text": "Wow! Fresh seafood has been found in Charlotte NC! I am a Miami boy, so I know fresh, and this was fresh. The Inn was busy, it was right after Sunday church wen we arrived, but we were seated immediately. The server was very nice, and attentive to our needs, and was quick to refill our drinks without being asked. Always a plus.  The Sunday special is fried baby shrimp for $7, and my Daughter Alex ordered hers with a baked potato and cole slaw. She doesn't eat any seafood except shrimp, and they have to be tail free, so this fit her requirements. Alina ordered the everyday special, which was $10. The special includes flounder fillet, deviled crab and baby shrimp, a side and cole slaw. I ordered the salt & pepper catfish fillet, with fries and cole slaw. My girls don't eat cole slaw, so Daddy gets all 3. The dishes were served quickly, and we were blown away at how much food there was. Being Sunday, these were not lunch sized portions, you can only order those Tue-Sat. But even for a dinner portion, they were very generous.   Everything was very tasty, at least half of everything came home with us (except the cole slaw, which I finished). The people kept pouring in while we were there, and the staff managed to handle things without an issue. We didn't order dessert, but the cakes in the display case in front of the restaurant looked decadent. Maybe next time. Less than $40 for lunch for 3, with a ton of leftovers. Oh, and a Diet Coke in a to go cup. Well worth a return visit.",

Most all of the food was delicious.  I didn't care much for the coleslaw, it wasn't bad, just not very flavorful.  I recommend trying the salt and pepper seasoning on your fried seafood, delicious.    We will definitely go again, the next time we are in town.",

    "text": "Harbor Inn is a solid seafood restaurant.  It's one of the places that I occasionally visit since moving to the area.  Never had any issues with the staff as they are always very friendly and courteous.  The main reason to come here though is for the fried food.  The portions are very large, rarely am I able to actually finish the entire meal.  The price is very reasonable for what you get as well.  When going all out fried I usually go for the Fried Seafood Platter which gets you flounder fillet, jumbo shrimp, deviled crap, baby shrimp, a stuffed clam, and fried oysters for only around $13.  It also comes with hush puppies and a side.  So it's quite a bit of food.  Great tasting food at that.  Lately however, I've been trying out the broiled menu and while it's much better for you, it's just not as tasty as the fried stuff.  So if you're worried about your calories then you should probably stay away for now.  I limit my trips to Harbor Inn for those occasions where I can afford to eat all the fried stuff because no way will I sit back and inhale the pleasant fumes of fried seafood and not take part in the fun.  Good food, great price, great service. Recommended.",

Calorie counters should probably stay away from this place. You could have gained a pound or two just by being exposed to the aroma of my meal. My only let down was that there was no bar where solo diners can have a beer and watch tv while eating, so I took my meal back to the hotel. I will definitely go back and would recommend it to others.",

    "text": "We love this place, so it's difficult to be unbiased about my review. First, there's no illusion here, this is, as the red necks say, a fish camp, so don't be surprised when your flatware arrives in a plastic bag. The menu has its share of deeply fried fish fare and your side choices include the also fried, french fries and hush puppies. However, once you make your way past the fried with fried dishes, there is a great broiled section, that offers a variety of fish and shellfish broiled to perfection with some nice seasoning. Although your choice of non-fried sides is limited, you can find a moderately healthy meal here. I always get the broiled scallops and although one of the more expensive items on the menu, it is delicious, filling, and not \"break the bank\" expensive. But before you get too full, remember to leave room for the Crazy Cake! you cannot leave without picking up a slice, even if it is to take home. We are talking about a rainbow sprinkle topped cake made up of individual layers of chocolate, red velvet, carrot, and strawberry jam topped vanilla cake - that's right 4 layers, each with their complementary frostings holiding it together.   The kitsch of this place is everywhere, from the porthole shaped windows, to the nets and seashells hanging up on the dining floor. The waitstaff is always friendly, your glass is always full and the restaurant just has a sort of feel good quality about it that is difficult to explain.",

    "text": "Three and a half stars. If you like Southern fried seafood, broiled seafood, or steaks, this place will do in a pinch. We live about two miles away, so we get here a few times a year for fish and seafood.  We kicked off our meal with an order of fried pickles. Pinky's Westside Grill makes them a little better, but these were lightly breaded, fried to a golden, crispy brown, and served hot, with a creamy dill dressing: They're addictive fare for sure!   I'm partial to broiled fare, but my wife and kids like fried shrimp. Tonight, my wife and I had their broiled special, which is salmon strips, jumbo shrimp, hush puppies, sweet potato (you can choose fries or baked), and salad or slaw. The salad was nothing special, just iceberg, shredded carrots, cucumber chips, and a couple of grape tomatoes. The sweet potato was a little over-baked, but tasted fine. The hush pupples were tasty. The salmon was seasoned lightly and broiled in a little butter, I believe. The same can be said for the shrimp. They were very tasty.  One of my sons had lobster bisque, and the other one had fried shrimp. They were both stuffed when they left.  This is a little more upscale than the traditional Carolina fish camp. It isn't quite as compelling as the Mayflower near Concord Mills, and it's not quite the same as going to the coast, but if you're in the area and hungry for fish and seafood, it's definitely worth the visit. Prices are reasonable, service is adequate, and they're friendly and flexible.",

It was our first time there so we had no idea you had to pay up front so we sat their waiting for a check for a good 10 minutes because our server didn't even hand us a bill or tell us to have a good night. So we asked her if we paid at the table and she said \"no up front\". Again, didn't even tell us to have a good day or anything and clearly if we are asking where we pay we aren't sure what to do so she could have at least told us we needed a bill to give the front counter because when we walked up there the cashier was asking for our check. Just not friendly at all.",

Our waitress was awesome she was attentive and got all our orders in and out at the same time.

    "text": "If you are part of Charlotte's largest religious denomination then you need to be aware of Harbor Inn Seafood.  As Roman Catholics celebrate lent, meatless Fridays open up the opportunities for Friday fish fries.  I have been looking for a large portioned and aggressively priced provider of scrumptious fish.  I tried other places and service left much to be desired, but Harbor Inn was flawless.  I called in an order and they said ten minutes, I got there nine minutes later and I waited one minute and my food was ready.  This compares favorably to the hour and a half I spent elsewhere waiting ten minutes.  The flavor - perfect.  The food is greasy, but it is minimally greasy to accomplish that perfect flavor profile without making you feel weighted down.  The portions - massive.  I got the Friday special and for $7 I was stuffed to the gills.  A healthy portion of fish, an abundance of shrimp (I almost couldn't finish it all), along with about ten hush puppies.  The only thing I would want more of is the fish, I would gladly trade some shrimp and sides to get another filet in there.  The sauces - spot on.  The cocktail sauce is just the right amount of kick to make you take notice.  The tartar sauce is rich and mild and goes well with everything.  They give you butter for the puppies if you are so inclined.  I will be here every Friday until Lent ends, and then I will probably just keep coming back.  The largest negative is the divided highway, this far East W. T. Harris is a pain to turn around on.",

While the chicken tenders were your normal chicken tenders, the shrimp and the whiting were very good. I also had a baked potato and hush puppies which were both really good. Your meal comes with slaw which tasted pretty good but not the best. Will definitely be returning to try other things on the menu.",

As ever, you can go broiled or fried but if you are jonesing for real fish camp, you'll go fried. Their fish fry isn't too heavy or greasy, good portion. Polite, attentive service and VERY clean.  Unlike a lot of other fish camp joints, they do have a beer/wine license so you can enjoy a bottle of brew while you get your fish camp on. Also plenty of seating for big parties and no problem handling them.",

(half cooked)..... I'm so disappointed cause I worked in a place like this before and we can't close up until 30mins before closing and we still can't close but we can clean a little..... I spent $97.00 dollars... I'm not to happy about that... I do hope today after talking to them they will make me happy..... if not then we know to never go there again when it's close to closing.",

I didn't like the kind of fries that they serve, I love French fries especially the crinkle cut but there is one particular kind of FF's that I don't like and they just so happen to serve them. Another thing I didn't like was that the fish still had the skin on  it, not too much of a big deal cause I ate it but I prefer my fish without it. I do like the face that they give u the option of a regular baked potato or sweet potato.  My server was very nice but she was running around like she had a lot of tables and that place wasn't that busy considering it was lunch time. She forgot my straws for my drinks and my extra napkins until I was able to get her attention again. Other than that this place was look. Would I come back? Maybe but there are some other nice restaurants in the area.",

Starting back in the 60's I went with my folks, back when it was a cool place built out in the water, on a regular basis and for years. I was hooked on the jumbo shrimp until I eventually got hooked on the deliciousness of the filet of flounder and thanks to this place I still seek out a decent flounder wherever seafood is sold   I have lived on both coasts and have spent time at sea in the Navy plus 15 years by the ocean in New England and most recently as a resident of the Gulf Coast and I have has seafood and fish from most of the waters of the world. While Boston's Legal Seafood does fly in fresh fish daily not every place can FedEx their daily specials but Harbor Inn always seems to have fresh tasting fish on their menu day in and day out.  I have followed them now to 3 different locations and I still love the food, service and overall experience. Good service, nice portions, reasonable prices and fine deserts.

On DoorDash I ordered the pick 2 combination with Flounder & baby shrimp. Jumbo shrimp is an option on the actual menu, but for some reason I couldn't order it with DoorDash. So the next time I visited and ordered Flounder & Jumbo Shrimp. I always order my Fried Seafood extra crispy and with both order methods that's exactly what I received. The seafood was seasoned great and available quick. They put the side sauces of Tarter & Cocktail in larger 4 oz container instead of the small 2oz that you get at most places. This helps you reduce your cost from order extra sides of sauce! Harbour in is one of 2 places i'll be visiting regularly for my fried seafood needs.",

This isn't be type of salads I'm used to eating or being served. The restaurant should look into using romaine lettuce with ice berg lettuce or a spring salad mix and add shredded carrots to bring more color to the salad & make it more appealing. This salad is also served with a side of fruit with cottage cheese. This side item looks as if it should be served to school age children. It also appears to be straight out of the can, when serving fruit as a side it should come diced or sliced & not as halves. When ordering the shrimp salad you are given the option to have it boiled or fried... Boiled will be served cold...  Overall I'm not too thrilled about my 1st visit, I may come back for dinner but no time soon.",

They also had TVs so that we could watch the game while we ate. I ordered the combination of three items that included tilapia, flounder,& baby shrimp with fries as the side, & the helping was generous! The food was hot, fresh, & seasoned well! We will definitely come back!",

    "text": "Since we moved to Charlotte we have been looking for a great seafood place. We visited this location last night and were so impressed! Fantastic food and service! The broiled shrimp plater was delicious and actually came with a good portion of shrimp. Perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp. The fries were seriously the best I've ever had.  My husband got the ribs and broiled crab cluster combo, both were excellent! The crab clusters were broiled to perfection!  They also have great steak and followed cooking instructions (well done-NO pink, steak came out cooked well done but still delicious / not tough).   My husband and his grandpa like to give the server some good jokes and laughs and our waitress took it like and champ and gave it back as well. Seriously the most kind, friendly, and responsive service we have had in the Charlotte area!   To top it off, the atmosphere was very inviting and family friendly.   10/10!!",

We were seated quickly, our waitress was very attentive and nice.  Complementary hush puppies were brought to the table and I swear they must have been eaten in less than 5 mins.  Our food was out super fast.  The flounder and tilapia were very good and we loved their fries.  Nobody had any complaints and we now have a seafood restaurant to visit.",

    "text": "Wow! My meal tonight was near perfection. i ordered the Fried seafood platter. It came with baby shrimp, jumbo shrimp, flounder, stuffed clam, deviled crab, and oysters... hey I was hungry lol.   Jumbo shrimp: They were big and juicy. They were not fried too hard and had a light coating. Very delicious.  Baby shrimp: They were pretty tasty. Not stringy at all. Did not leave a greasy taste in my mouth.  Flounder: It was decent. I thought it was a bit dry. This was remedied with tartar sauce, but definitely not the favorite part of my meal.   Stuffed Clam: The stuffed clam tasted great. I don't know if many people would like it, but I was a big fan.   Deviled crab: Cooked very well. It was not greasy or overly \"crabby\" in taste.   Oysters: They were my favorite part of the meal. I love that distinct taste and texture from deep fried oysters.   Although the food was great, I enjoyed the service as well. Staff was attentive, kind, and efficient. I felt as if they appreciated my business.   I know Harbor Inn, like any place, has it's good days and bad days. Today was definitely a good day. Today's meal is the type of meal that can turn a stranger into a fan. Keep up the excellent work!",
