It's a shame that people really serve that and say it's a Peruvian dish. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone! You have to pay extra for everything. The only good thing about this place are the servers.",

Everything is clean & neat with a nice, warm decor.  The music was a bit loud for a small space, but not overwhelming.  The waitress was pleasant enough & brought our food quickly.  They have outdoor seating on the sidewalk...this is a strip mall place, but there are bushes & trees, so it's nice.  I had the rotisserie chicken salad w/fries $9.75 and my sweetie had the 1/2 chicken w/rice $11.75 so I think the pricing is high for what you get.   I probably wouldn't be back just because of the cost.",

I am not a salad person by any measure (see steak and sashimi), but I could eat salads from Pio Pio every day of the week.  On the con-side this is a chain, but it is a really good chain.  I can't say much more because I only ever get the take-out.  Be careful to check that you have all the sauces you want, the dressing makes or breaks the meal.  They are good about giving you sauce but sometimes they may not give you the sauces you wanted - the green sauce usually comes with the yuca fries - it is great on everything.  Stop reading this: GO TO PIO PIO!  Still reading?  I love avocados and this place gives you plenty on the salad.  I have to admit the salad has been so great I haven't ordered anything else.  My lack of exploration for a variety addict such as myself should be a huge indicator how good this place is.",

You can easily split between 4 people and it lets you try a few of the different sides as well. It comes with a whole chicken and several sides (which you can choose from). I always get the salad which has a good portion of avocado and has a really yummy dressing along with shaved carrots and cabbage! The tostones and plantains are also really good. Their sangria is tastey, however I had a hard time drinking it with all the diced apples and ice floating around in the glass. Maybe I'm just an amateur.

Sweet Plantains are same good everywhere I have eaten them!  The Yucca was good too!  Purple Corn Juice was one of the Beverages and Blackberry Juice was the fuschia colored one!

    "text": "I have been going to Pio Pio since the week I moved to Charlotte, three years ago, and I have never been disappointed by their wonderfully tender and juicy chicken. Hailing from Miami, I was unbelievably excited when someone told me about this Peruvian restaurant that served fried yuca, tostones, plantains, and arepas. I immediately went to check it out and thank goodness I did!   Their rotisserie chicken is ALWAYS tender and juicy and cooked just right and the skin is perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of crunch. Then there is their sauces..mmmm. Right away they serve these two sauces (one green, one white) and I have no clue what they are but you want to drench everything you get with them. The white one is delicious on their salads, which added bonus: comes with some sliced avocado on top for a nice little touch.   The restaurant is fairly small and can pack up pretty quickly. Also, once something must have happened because the entire place was filled with smoke and now I have a friend who will only eat outside. However, the service is always a little above average but frankly, it normally wouldn't hurt to add an extra person. I love coming to Pio Pio for a quick but delicious meal. I love it so much, I even went to the one in New York last time I was up there!",

I think it's a really great concept, and some of things here are pretty good.  Their chicken is fairly good, but I've had cheaper and better chicken before.  Their plantains are also delicious; lightly sweet and flavorful.  The best of the sides is definitely the rice and beans.  However, the yucca is just ok; it's like a thicker potato in texture, and kind of stringy.  The arepas are bland and quite disappointing.    Their lunch specials range from around $9-14, which I think is a little pricey for chicken and sides.  At dinner time, you can get a whole chicken, or you can also get a meal with sides.  The chicken alone is $10, or you can get a chicken combo for $25-35.  They also have other dinners available for $12-16 on average.  Their carry-out service is pretty quick as well.  All in all, I think A-Ok describes how I feel about this place.",

The chicken was perfectly roasted and I loved the spicy green sauce on the side. I could definitely do without the tostones--for some reason I thought it could be like a chicken taco/sandwich but it didn't really hold it's shape or taste like anything. The plantains and yucca were your typical fried fare and a nice accompaniment.  I found the chicken to be just the right size but go ahead and order more chicken if you'd like. You could always have it for lunch the next day.",

Having no concept of what Peruvian food was we were a little reluctant at first but agreed to branch out! (SPOILER ALERT::: SO WORTH IT)   Since there were four of us eating we decided to order the Matador Combo (a dinner option for 4 people).  It came with a whole rotisserie chicken (2 dark meat pieces and 2 white meat pieces), salad with amazing tangy dressing, rice and beans that you can mix together, frankfurters and fries, tostones and ripe plantains. The food came out in family style and the portions were very large. Surprisingly we had left overs and we were all stuffed! I recommend the combos because of the variety of food you get to try.   The restaurant was smaller inside that I was anticipating but had a cozy feel. We ate at about 1pm, so not right during the Sunday lunch rush, and there was only 1 table available. The service was great though! We never had an empty drink and we were always asked if there was anything that we needed. I hate that we live so far away from this location, if we lived closer we would be eating there often!",

The chicken was great and the plantains were delicious.  We will definitely be going back.",

Unfortunately the first couple of things I ordered off the menu were so good that I've never tried anything else there:  the delicious, tomatoey squid appetizer, and then the Campestre combo, which is enough delicious roast chicken, salad, and fried things for two or more people to be happily stuffed.  The frozen fruit smoothies and sangria are tasty too.  I don't know how \"authentic\" this place is but they make wonderful comfort food and you can be sure it will always be good.",

Unfortunately, I would have to give the service a C-, at best.  Initially seated near the door, I asked for a table change to avoid the cold draft.  The server responded with a rude, \"No!\".  Thankfully, another server accomodated the request.  No one asked if we needed refills on our drinks (we did).  When we were finally given our bill, we gave the server the coupon (which we told them we had upon being seated).  We waited and waited for the revised bill reflecting the discount.  The server finally returned to the table and said that if we weren't going to order anything else he would have to charge us for sitting at the table because the table was needed for other customers. (And no, he wasn't joking.) Excuse me???  We're waiting to pay YOU and you are going to charge us for \"table time\"?  They seemed to be certainly overwhelmed by the crowd---but, on a Friday evening what were they expecting?  All said, because the food was good, and the reviews have been consistently favorable, I am going to give this place a second chance.  I just will make sure to avoid them during peak times (no Friday or Saturday evening or lunch time!).",

A quarter chicken meal will run you $9~ and when you include a drink and tip, you are way over $10 for a pretty simple meal.    The serving sizes are not large but the flavor is amazing and it's hard to beat.  I think this place has the best rotisserie chicken in Charlotte.  The location can be somewhat tricky to find.  Pio Pio is in the southeast corner of East and Scott.  It's in that shopping plaza and it's in the corner.  The last time I was there, Pio Pio did not have a real sign outside yet.",

I ordered an interesting beer, cant recall it name and half a chicken, my girlie ordered some outstanding soup and a 1/4...we could not believe how good it was.  we both destroyed our meals and then ordered a whole chicken to go FOR $9...all of that was south of $40 and I got another beer, of course.  they used fresh free range chicken from a farm in south carolina which should be important to everyone bc of how disgusting the commercial chicken industry can be.  they roast it in a european brock oven that PERFECTLY AND I MEAN PERFECTLY cooks it, they give you a couple oil based scratch made sauces one is savory and one is spicy made with habeneros...they give you some great fried yuca and ripe plantains phenomenal beans and some rice...all in all this place is one of the best values and meals in the city.  i plan to eat here several times a amonth moving forward and am really looking forward to it b/c i had been a bit down on chicken in general unless i made it and i cant make it like this.  go there, chill out, have a few beers and enjoy charlottes best roasted yard bird!!",

My one major complaint is the price...$10 for lunch is just too pricey, the same type of food in East Charlotte would be a lot less! They charged me 75 cents for white meat, which I thought was ridiculous. What is sad is that every time I go in there it is empty! Probably because o the high prices. They should take 1 to 2 dollars off each entree to be more competitive and I think their business would increase, because they have a great product.",

Our standard were set high and Pio Pio came short. The customer service was below average and our waiter she seemed more interested in closing.   Now let's dig in the important stuff, FOOD!  Overall, the food lacked the authentic South American flavors. The arepas were prepared just right. The chicharrone was cooked perfectly and trimmed very well.   My wife ordered the grill steak that were paired with beans, plantains and rice. The ripe plantains were over cooked and the beans had no flavor. I ordered arroz chaufa which disappointed me due to the lack ingredients and creativity. It was literally just rice, steak and eggs. It contain no peas, carrots or  sprouts. The plantains again were over cooked.   The tres leches was a bit dry but good. Nothing mind blowing or over the top. The food was okay maybe it was late at night.",

She also ordered the soup (maybe chicken) and it was green and horribly tasting. I had the breaded chicken, however I had ordered the beef. It was over fried. The plantains were not bad (hard to screw those up). It was way overpriced as we spend close to $40.00   A week later I went to order the rotisserie chicken. The chicken was good and the French fries while not perfect where plentiful. I had heard that it was better than Viva Chicken. Not a chance at all. Not only is it better at Viva Chicken but the variety of sides as well as the 4 different sauces to choose from makes it a winner.  Head to El Paisa for real Colombian and to Viva Chicken for chicken. You will not be dissapointed",

Having lived in South Florida for over 20 years before moving to North Carolina, I miss the great Latin food you can get in Miami and many other nooks and cranny's in that area. Charlotte has its own treasure trove of ethnic restaurants, you just have to know where to find them and boy is Pio Pio a find.   They're most known for their rotisserie chicken, but their steak and chicharones are even better, in my opinion. But, the real killer app at Pio Pio is their sauce. Sauces, I should say. The white sauce is a garlic sauce that is so full of flavor I could eat it on just about anything and it works great as salad dressing. The green sauce is spicy and is awesome combined with the white sauce. It tastes like a tomatillo sauce with a serious kick. To steal Emeril's line, these sauces would taste good on a car bumper.  If you're not sure what to try, get the Montanero platter. For just under 15 bucks you get rice, beans, ripe plantains, steak, egg, pork, skin (i.e. chicharones, and really good ones at that), sausage, avocado & corn cake. The corn cake (areppa) is very bland, but that's not unusual. Everything else is delicious and it's definitely enough for two. I've split it with my mom before and still had leftovers to take home. I also highly recommend the tostones (crispy fried plantains).  I travel about a half hour to get to Pio Pio and every time it's worth the drive. Hands down the best Latin restaurant I've tried in Charlotte.",

Incredible and you can get the super hot chimichurri red that is extremely hot for those that can take it.  Outstanding!",

Ordered the Red snapper which was over cooked and dried.    A side salad came before dinner that featured salad right out of a bag with standard ranch dressing.    The sides and garnishes like the yuca and plantain chips were also over cooked.  The only flavor came from the sauce.    Best way to describe this meal is like ordering fish at a Mexican restaurant.  Don't do it unless you know the cook.    While the staff was pleasant and friendly,  they came to the table only once after I was served.    Unimpressed and will not return.",

The chimichurri sauce will kick your butt though - dont eat that. The green sauce is also pretty hot - the white sauce is super yummy - get extra of that and use it on the salad - thats my jam!  I skip the rice and the beans usually - and never feel guilty about eating the yummy chicken, salad and plantains. :)",

While rotisserie chicken is good no matter how it's prepared, there wasn't a distinct \"Peruvian\" flavor. Maybe I'm ignorant (don't answer that please), but  it just tasted like any other roasted chicken with herbs and spices. Good nonetheless.   Sweet plaintains; well they're plantians no matter how you slice em. Fried yucca was just that, yummy in my tummy fried yucca. Rice and beans were solid but what Pio Pio does best are the dipping sauces.   I don't know how to describe them but I'm guessing one is a vinegar based garlic cream sauce and the second I can't even put my finger on. To be honest, I don't really care, it was good that's all I know. It's like going to a foreign country or eating foreign food. If it looks like grasshopper, crunches like grasshopper, well it just might be grasshopper! Don't ask, don't tell, just eat it if it's yummy!",

Instead of ordering the things that received the best reviews, like the meat platters and heavier South American dishes, my wife and I opted for the ceviches since the weather was very warm.  Our mistake was not understanding that Columbian ceviche comes swimming in an approximation of thousand island dressing and not simply in the usual citrus juice and herbs.  So it was just too goopy to be good.  We also had the shrimp in garlic with tostones which were great so, perhaps we try again and order smarter.",

Their speciality is Peruvian and Columbian cuisine which means lots of rotisserie chicken, beans, and plantains. Everything involving these elements is delicious. Granted, the other dishes are probably delicious as well, but you want to go for the bird.   The only reason I don't give Pio Pio 5 stars is that when I went, my friend and I both ordered 1/4 chickens. She got all white meat, and I got all dark meat and a smaller portion than her. We were able to equalize things a bit, but if I had been dining by myself, I would have been disappointed.",

    "text": "First, I'd like to thank yelp, because without this site I never would have known this restaurant existed. And I'm glad I took the time to experience it.   Went for lunch with a friend, he had the #6(?) salad, 1/4 chicken, and soup and I had the #16, arroz con pollo with fried yucca instead of french fries. Lots of lunch combos to choose from, mostly revolving around a 1/4 of chicken, chicken breast, pork chops, and possibly fish.. but the combinations seemed endless.  I have to say I was really surprised by the portion of rice, I couldn't finish it. The menu states it is a mix of vegetables and chicken and that it was, a very colourful and tasty blend of peas, corn, carrots, sausage, chicken, (i think that's about right) in rice with a few pieces of yucca. Lots of flavour and perfect consistency. (the yucca was, well, fried yucca. nothing spectacular) My friend's soup was delicious, though we both thought the section of corn still on the cob was a little odd to be served in the bowl, and some of the chicken pieces were a little large. The rotisserie chicken was moist and flavourful.  I'm not sure what the two sauces were on the table, my friend insisted the white one was what was also on his salad, but I was all about the green one. Kind of a green chili cream/mayo sauce? Whatever the ingredients, it had a nice little kick to it.  The staff was very helpful, and even though the space is small wasn't very crowded for lunch (maybe 1/3 full) There was a bit of a lag between us finishing  our meal and having the plates cleared/receiving the check, maybe because we weren't dressed in suits they assumed we weren't on a lunch break, but it was overall a minor infraction towards the whole meal.   Maybe not the \"best chicken in town\" like their sign says, but a very good meal and nice portions for a low price (each lunch was under $10). Definitely one to keep in mind when in that area of town.",

Pio's is golden, fall-off-the-bone tender, and though it's not particularly well-seasoned, the two sauce accompaniments give the chicken (and anything else you wish you smother said sauce with) an extra oomph.  The green sauce is muy spicy, and the white sauce is like a smoky ranch dressing.  Both are delish.    For sides: I love the saffron rice, and the ripe plantains here are so tasty and sweet I usually save them for dessert.   For appz: empanadas (beef or chicken patties), calamari, or if you're feeling extra carniverous try the sample platter - a heaping platter of fried and grilled meats, sausage, potatoes, and chicharrones...your arteries will probably hate you after eating this.

Add in a plate full of yuca and beans, maybe a beef empanada to start, and a cold beer.  Heaven.  Pio Pio nails it.  The food here is delicious, the service quick and friendly, and the location perfectly close to my house.  I can't say how excited I am to find good roasted chicken in my neighborhood.

I have been here many times with no major issues.... until I tried to use a Groupon voucher.  The server absolutely refused to accept the voucher without it being printed out.  He insisted that the rules on the voucher stated that it had to be printed out.  This was not the case nor does it make any sense.  I was not about to waste the money that I had spent on the voucher so a couple of weeks later I called in an order for takeout that I planned to use the Groupon for. I had no desire to dine in there again.  This time I had it printed out. Upon arrival the same server berated me, telling me that he was a part owner and that if I didn't want to follow the rules that I shouldn't come back.  I slid the printout across the bar as asked him to show me where it stated that I needed to have the certificate printed.  He, of course, could find no mention of this and insisted that this was not a certificate from the same company that I had tried to use the prior time that I had been there.  Yeah, because I'm going to buy more vouchers to a restaurant that treats its customers this poorly.  He was simply dead wrong but refused to admit it.    The rudeness was unacceptable.  Yeah they have good food.  But there are plenty of other places with tasty cuisine in the area that lack the Douche Factor.",

HIDDEN JEM in Charlotte, I am anxiously awaiting their new location in Ballantyne.  Their chicken and corn soup is a broth based chicken soup with chunks of chicken breast, corn and potatoes, SUPER YUMMY.  Their amazing homemade spicy sauce and salad dress are both amazing.  You must try this restaurant! You will definitely not be dissapointed! DELICIOUS!",

The only reason why I give it 3 stars is because the chicken ( their main dish) wasn't as yummy as I expected it, well seasoned around but a little dry. The rest of the food we ordered was really good and well portioned, their Sangria is pretty good, I would go back definitely, I recommend it give it a try if you are in the area. Oh btw their are different owners from the Pio Pio in Ballantine, the waiter made sure to clarify. :)",

I get the 1/4 chicken dinner -- once with tostones and once with plantains. AWESOME. The chicken is perfectly cooked and the tostones and plantains are nice and sweet. Then there is the savory beans. Never have enough room for the rice. Haha. I'm sure other stuff here must be good too -- but can't resist the chicken!",

    "text": "If you've not had Central or South American food before, please head to Pio Pio and introduce yourself to it. Specializing in Peruvian and Colombian cuisine, they serve some tasty food. Plenty of roasted meats, beans, corn (but not how you're used to having it), plantains, and interesting sauces. And random French fries where you'd least expect it.  But go for the chicken - roasted meats are a staple in this region (and the star of the show at meals), and Pio Pio makes an incredible roast chicken.  The services was great, too. Friendly and attentive. It's a very small location, though, with few tables. My personal opinion is that the price-per-plate is a dollar or two high for what you get (portions and experience), but that's just me.  All in all, it's a great little place to check out and a new option for us when we're on this side of town.",

Sometimes, even if you are living in the land of golden fried chicken, you're just jonesing for a nice, juicy, decently seasoned pollo rostizado with all of the fixins.

It was enough for two dinners plus two lunches the next day. Have to order from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodiecall.com&s=3b4ec092753de9fca1b849804b3f7b32b47e78da9718343e27f857d44f2d8a99\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodiecall.com</a> (they have a phone number too...).

The jaela had pieces of octopus that were uncooked. In fact, half of the pieces of seafood I got in the platter were uncooked or chewy in texture but not in a good way.

I ordered an arepa as an appetizer and I loved it! My friend thought it was plain, but I like plain food so I was happy. But the highlight was the roasted chicken I ordered. It was juiciest chicken I've had a restaurant. I got plantains on the side and they were just perfect. We also shared a sangria, I forgot the name of it, but it was delicious and wonderfully sweet.

They totally forgot about it. So it took another 20mins to get ones attention to remind them of the water.   I truly forgot what I order. When I see on the menu, I will recognize it.

I've subbed the rice out for vegetables for a $.75 fee, and it was worth it for a lighter option. The quality is about middle of the road, and always tastes delicious. They have a creamy sauce or spicy with all the food so you can tone it down or bring up the heat on your own. A great option for a quick, flavorful, healthy dinner (or unhealthy if you'd like).",

Years ago I remember if you went on a Friday or Saturday night you had to wait for a table.  We went last Friday at around 7:00pm and there were several tables open.   The last few times we were there we noticed the quality and portions had gone significantly down hill.  It's probably been a few years since we were back but decided to give it another chance with a Groupon. Safe to say we will stick with Viva Chicken here on out.   I don't know where Pio Pio is getting their chickens from these days but they are more like Cornish Hens with very little meat on them. The black beans came in a tiny bowl with mostly broth and maybe 2 spoons of actual beans.  The rice was good. They used to have several different kinds of sauces- not anymore.  It's just ok but given that viva chicken is 10x better why would I go back to subpar Pio Pio- disappointing because at one time this place was great.",

I like the fact that the food here is consistent. Servers are always polite, but you may get one where their English is a bit choppy. Be patient. The food is worth it. You must try their homemade Sangria. Delicious!  Overall it is a great establishment that serves up authentic cuisine that is delicious.  TIP: Check Groupon first before you ask for the check. Sometimes they have a special listed on Groupon.",

I ordered the number 4 lunch combo: rotisserie chicken w/ yucca fries, yellow rice, beans and large side of plantains. The plantains are EVERYTHING!!!!! And the potion size is massive!!!  The yucca fries will change your life--no joke. The Rotisserie chicken is perfection!!! Seasoned just right! Of course we couldn't finish everything--To-go Boxes please!!! Too much to finish   The restaurant is a good size, well staffed. Clean. There's a bar. I wonder if they get much business in the evening. Seems like most people come during the afternoon. There is lots of parking available which is always an added plus!",

I ordered a side salad too and I'm glad because I needed something raw to go with my meal. The chicken was good, the plantains sweet and the rice was just there. When you go, try to sit away from the windows because the glare is very strong. Our waiter wasn't very helpful, it was our first time there and the menu doesn't give much of a clue as to what you'll get. Check pictures on yelp first so you're prepared when you're getting rushed to order. I noticed they had sangria just now, who knows maybe it would've been good? Eh, next time I want rotisserie I will go to Viva Chicken in Huntersville. It's hard not to compare and I like Viva's sauces better.",

First came the salad with avocado and a tangy homemade dressing. It was refreshing and flavorful! Then came the main course...and it did not disappoint. The generously sized chicken was moist and succulent. The yucca, beans and rice were all delicious, especially when accompanied by their creamy dipping sauces (the green one is quite spicy). My favorite way to finish a Peruvian meal is with sweet plantains, and Pio Pio's were perfect. Nicely caramelized on the outside and soft on the inside. We left very satisfied with plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. I highly recommend stopping by!",

The restaurant had a few other tables full when we arrived, a mix of couples, families, people dropping by for take out, and a Bring Me That delivery employee waiting for a delivery order. I ordered the 1/4 chicken white meat meal with rice, beans, and plantains. My husband got the 1/4 dark with yucca. Everything was great! The chicken was super flavorful, even bites without skin tasted like the marinade/seasonings they use. The rice, as many other reviewers have mentioned, is delicious - the saffron flavor is definitely noticeable, but not overpowering (I love saffron, so I was not surprised that the rice was one of my favorite parts of the meal -  a close second to the chicken.) The plantains and yucca sides were both great, too. We live nearby, so I'm sure we'll be dining in and picking up to go orders regularly.",

Please support this local business.  I hope to still be a customer of this place  for as long as I still have teeth to eat with!   PS - The 2 sauces are very delicious and are sold in larger containers for something like $3-$5 dollars.  If anyone has found a recipe for either sauce or have reverse engineered it please let me know!",

We ordered 1/2 chicken with plantains, rice and beans. Chicken was cooked to perfection each time. My favorite is definitely the plantains.  Will have to stop by for dinner the next time.",

The portions of food are also huge! You will be stuffed. I got the Montanero off the specialties area of the menu. Steak, rice, beans, plantains, avocado, arepa, crunchy pork skin, and an egg! Can you even image eating the entire plate?! I do every time, it's that delicious! Pio Pio has become an addiction for me, and I absolutely love it. Keep in mind the restaurant is small, so there is never an overwhelming atmosphere especially if you're looking for an intimate evening! The servers even alternate (if you're comfortable) with speaking spanish/english. I really think that's what adds the extra touch of Latin vibe.",

After placing an order it is typically ready within 10-20 minutes of the call.   The food is absolutely amazing and the price point is unbeatable. My usual order is a whole rotisserie chicken, large rice and large beans. This order comes with two white sauce and two green sauce. I prefer the white sauce over the green sauce as the green sauce is very spicy.   They have a small patio for outside dining and when I have eaten at the restaurant the service has always been great!   Highly recommend! Authentic and delicious!",

The space is kind of small but we have never had an issue having our party, big or small, accommodated in a timely manner.  Sometimes there is a slight \"language barrier\" with some of the servers. It can be tough to understand some of the servers when asking questions, but they are always polite and quick with service.  One of our favorite items to order is the appetizer platter with a side of tostones and guacamole. My husband and I will often make a meal out of it! Tostones, arepa, frankfurters, pork belly, sauteed potatoes and more paired with the chimichurri sauce is fantastic!  Other great options for a family are the combos. The pricing is very affordable and you get to try a ton of sides. We love the rice and beans as well as the Yuca.  Coupon or not, this place is a must try!",

Customer service has always been okay, I didn't expect much given I was picking up food anyway.  My husband and I decided to eat in last week and our meal was the usual- decent food that made a quick weekday dinner, loud but peppy music, decent service! I signed the receipt and remember I signed it off as an even $30 (including tip). While reviewing my a/c statement yesterday I noticed I was charged 31.52. This made no sense to me and I was quite honestly surprised. Wanting to let them  know (of human error, ignorance or foul play) I called the restaurant and asked to speak with the manager. I was told he wasn't available. I told the woman on the phone (who was really sweet and appreciative of my call) what had happened and left a message for the Manager to call me back. It's been over 24 hours and I haven't received a call yet.  Long story short- I feel cheated. A dollar fifty doesn't matter, it's about honesty and integrity. Signed receipts being manipulated (erroneously or on purpose) is appalling and I'm sure illegal.  Gave them 2 stars- for the hundreds of meals I've eaten here and because I don't think everyone deserves to be blamed for what is (hopefully) one person's error.",

It's not very often that I'm in Dilworth, but a friend of mine told me to give this place a try for some of the best rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted. And this place did not disappoint at all!   We stopped in on Sunday afternoon, we were greeted when we walked in and led to our seat. The first thing I noticed was that the interior was very small, with wooden tables and chairs. But they do have a small outside seating area which I'm sure is very nice for the summer time. But don't let the small interior fool you, this place gets packed!   Anyway, after being led to our seat and given our menu, I already knew what I wanted to try...Dinner combo #1 which comes with a quarter chicken, rice and beans, and plantains.   When the drinks were brought out, we also were presented with two sauces one white and one green, I'm not sure what they were called but they were very delicious. The green sauce had a nice kick to it, and with the chicken and plantains...it is a perfect compliment.   Oh My Goodness....that chicken was heavenly! I mean, seriously it was fall off the bone good!   It was all the things perfectly cooked rotisserie chicken should be, moist, tender, hot and seasoned perfectly! The rice and beans were delicious as well, I mixed my beans in the rice and together with the chicken and sauces each bite got better and better.   I only wish I had followed my boyfriend's suggestion and ordered a half chicken, like he did because it was soooo good I wanted more.   Awesome place! Delicious food! Definitely look forward to another trip!",

This is a small place but the space is used to the max, smaller 2-seat tables along the walls of the restaurant and larger 4-seater tables in the middle.  The decor on the walls is simple.  On the left wall, there is a \"wall of fame\" with all the articles featuring the restaurant.  The menu is easy to read and lists all the Peruvian specialties.  One good test of a Peruvian place is the rotisserie chicken so I went with that.  It came with rice and beans and your choice of another side.  I went with plantains.    The chicken was decent and moist but I didn't catch much flavor from the skin except for it was a bit greasy.  The plaintains were not carmelized like I usually like them but they were decent.  Nothing exceptional.  The beans were amazing and probably the best beans I've ever had at a latin restaurant.  The spicy dipping sauce is killer!    Decent place.  If I come back, I will probably try something else on the menu.    I'd give this 3 1/2 stars.",

    "text": "Oh, why did it take so long for us to try Pio Pio?  We've already been back!  Maybe the reason is because I am not a huge fan of chicken.  But their chicken is in a class all of its own - it's moist, tender, and delicious!    We have tried two appetizers so far - the guacamole and tostones (thinly sliced fried plantains), and the chicken and beef patties.  You get a hefty serving of guacamole and six large tostones.  This appetizer was filling and delicious.  The meat patties are filled with ground beef or shredded chicken, rice, and potatoes.  They are small, but spicy and delicious - especially with the sauces!    For our entrees, I have tried the #1 - 1/4 white meat chicken and #12 tilapia.  Like I said before, the chicken is very good.  The sides are also tasty and go well with the chicken.  The buttery rice was my favorite.  (I do wish, however, that the yuca were sliced smaller and were a little crispier.)  Topped with a tomato salsa, their tilapia is crispy and really good with the white sauce.   My hubby has tried the chicken as well, and also #21 skirt steak. I'm usually NOT a fan of steak, but this was very thinly sliced, tender, and juicy.  The chimichurri sauce was a great complement to the steak.  I cannot neglect to mention the sauces.  You get two sauces with your meal - a spicy green sauce and a lemony white sauce.  I loved both of them, and used them with the tostones and chicken.  While we usually didn't need dessert, we had to try their tres leche cake at least once.  They gave us a slice large enough for sharing, and we thought it was quite good.  Service is fast, friendly, and efficient.  I appreciated how quickly they cleared off tables when people left so the restaurant appeared clean and welcoming.    Pio Pio is a definite keeper for us!",

    "text": "Even though I grew up in South Florida, where we had a number of South American establishments, I don't believe I've had Columbian or Peruvian before but was sure happy to try it out. I had a BOGO coupon from my Citipass book (they offer two coupons for Pio Pio in there-score!) and decided to check out this cozy establishment.   First thing I noticed-- when walking it, the space was small, dimly lit, intimate---saucy!   Second thing I noticed--the appearance of the food! The table next to us got their food right as we were sitting down and I think I made it awkward moment b/c I just kept starting at this chicken all lustfully and stuff. I guess it could be considered creepy the way I was eyeing their food but whatev. My staring was a compliment.  Third thing I noticed-the menu and prices. I like that the menu wasn't dish overload with too many things that sound delicious. I hate when that happens because I usually pick something random in the end since I feel pressured to order. The prices were way more reasonable then I thought they would be. Many dinners for under ten bones that come with rice and plantains. Sign me up,  Four thing I noticed--the taste of the food. I got the quarter chicken with rice, beans and plantains.The chicken was all that and a bag of chips! It was moist, flavorful and juicy. They also brought out a white garlic sauce that looked similar to tsaziki sauce along with a green jalapeno sauce that had my eyes watering. Both were equally fantastic on the chicken and on top of the rice. The rice wasn't anything to write home about taste wise but the plantains were as good as I expected---I miss having plantains that taste like they should! South Florida would be proud of you Pio Pio!  Fifth thing I noticed---lighting fast and friendly service. Sometimes places take forever once you hand them a coupon and our waiter had it back within two minutes.  Sixth thing I noticed-how fun saying Pio Pio over and over again is!  Seventh thing I noticed-how long this review was--oopsie  All in all, a terrific place and wallet friendly. I will be back in the future!",

The corn cake with \"sausage\" (actually seemed to be deep fried pork belly) was inedible.   Next up were our entrees. We both went with the chicken, served with rice and beans. I choose the plantains and Ted went with the yucca for our sides. The chicken was ok but as others have noted, seemed like it was microwaved -- literally SMOKING hot and pretty tough/dry. The rice and beans, also smoking hot, were probably the best thing on the plate. My plantains were good but cold. Ted's yucca were also cold and slightly stale.   They only offer 2 sauces -- a white sauce (it's ranch, right?) and a green sauce. The green sauce is good but again, I had a hard time not comparing it to Viva Chicken's sauces which just run circles around poor Pio Pio.",

    "text": "Despite lackluster service at this location, Pio Pio serves up some of the best rotisserie chicken in the Charlotte area. After todays lunch, I have now tried both Charlotte Pio Pio locatons and have found both to provide consistently tender and juicy rotisserie chicken and superb sides like moist yellow rice, perfectly prepared plantain and pinto beans. The side salads are particularly unique and refreshing, topped with sliced avocado, freshly cut lettuce and carrots and topped with their wonderful tangy house dressing.   Dinner prices are reasonable however lunch prices are somewhat high. Both locations  also typically have the same acceptable sanitation score in the mid-90s. The Ballantyne location offers a much more appealing atmosphere and more attentive service. That one is a Gotta Try, this one not so much.",

I was shocked at the reasonable prices on the menu. We ordered the half chicken, beans and saffron rice, along with fried ripe plantains.  The chicken was unbelievably moist as well as stupendously delicious. The saffron rice was delicious also as were the beans. It's been more than 30 years since I've had plantains, and I was delighted that they were as wonderful as I remembered.   The service was very pleasant, but a bit slow. I'm not sure if it was possibly a language \"thing\" or not. Anyway, they were exceptionally courteous as well as extremely Beautiful.  At first glance, the restaurant appeared to be very clean. Upon further inspection into the ladies room, I discovered just how clean the restaurant really is. They definitely deserve their \"A\" rating.   As we were leaving the restaurant, dinner was delivered to another table. They were having the red snapper, and it looks so amazing that we decided that will be what we order on our next visit. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Tried Pio Pio for the first time on Sunday night with my husband as we had a Groupon ($9 for $20) and figured it was worth the try! Oh was it worth it! The place was pretty packed so that was a good sign.   Most meals are $10-$13 and since we're savvy savers, we decided to go with the full chicken (most meals only include 1/4 chicken) to split, which was only $10. We also ordered a side of the saffron rice and plantains ($16.50 total). The chicken was served with 2 sauces- a green sauce that tasted like spicy basil and a white sauce that has a hint of horseradish. Both were excellent with the chicken and the rice. Oh and did I mention the rice? The side ($3.50) came with 2 giant helpings! We had so much food on our table. It was a Peruvian Thanksgiving!   However, the plantains were the real winner of the night. They were cooked to perfection. Soft on the inside and crispy on the out. Mix a little green sauce on top of them and you have the perfect combination of sweet and spicy!  I knocked off a star from my review because the service was really odd. We had above 3 different servers the entire time. We weren't sure if all servers helped each other out or what. Kinda strange. We also ordered a side salad because Yelp said we should, however it never came. The one server remembered towards the end of our meal, but we were too full to accept it. I would return and opt for splitting a large salad and full chicken next time.",

We often purchase the Groupon or Livingsocial deal to save $$, but the prices quite reasonable already (who doesn't enjoy saving money?).  Averaging about $10-13 for an entree, the portion sizes are quite adequate and worth the money.  I fell in love with Pio Pio at the Ballantyne location and was thrilled to learn they had a location a little closer in town.  I brought my husband here last year and it was his first time eating Peruvian/Colombian food and he's been hooked ever since.  We usually dine here Sundays after church or during the week for lunch and will say that this location is smaller than the Ballantyne location.  The food is quite flavorful and the sauces add a nice touch and the servers are quite attentive and accommodating, which makes a great dining experience overall.",

What we had was Lomo by name, but not taste. DISAPPOINTING. What's more, there was a vinegar after taste. If you're a Lomo lover, skip this dish!  The rotisserie chicken was tender and tasty. Nevertheless, it's similar to Costco rotisserie not a traditional Peruvian rotisserie with the expected spices. I do question if they just buy Costco rotisserie chickens and resell them.  The rice was moist, but the added food coloring strange. The beans needed work, spice, something... less of a just dropped this out of a can taste.   Finally, it's extremely tacky to see handwritten signs for up charges on sauces for a sit down restaurant.  DC has a plethora of authentic Peruvian spots. I can only assume Charlotte might not.",

It is a little bit hidden back in a strip mall which sounds bad but it's a nice strip mall...I mean c'mon it's Dilworth after all.  After you find it, parking is a breeze.  We almost exclusively go for the rotisserie chicken and saffron rice.  You absolutely can't go wrong with those.  From there we tend to mix it up each time and maybe do some soup or fried yuca or something like that.  Portions are pretty big...we almost always have a to go box.  And come to think of it I don't believe we have ever had dessert there.  But I'm sure if we did we would like it as well.  We can usually get out of there for $25-$30 for 2 people which is pretty good for us.  **update** we just ate at Pio Pio tonight and finally had dessert.  Got the tres leches and it was delish!  Another reason to like this place.  We give it 4.5 machu picchu's out of 5",

It really is hard not to call this place a \"hidden gem\" since i've never even seen it and i've been in the shopping center it is located several times and driven by thousands of times. Tracked it down by selecting a random Entertainment Book coupon and heading there for lunch. Fun game.  So apparently chicken is their thing...after looking up Pio Pio online, it said it was the \"short weak cry of a young bird\" which is actually kind of sad. Anyway, there were several enticing lunch options assuming you like chicken. i went with a salad topped with rotisserie chicken and avocado. You can substitute other sides for the french fries. i went with the veggies which were good. One of the sauces they bring was really good with a great spice. Very good.   Almost forgot about the juice. i tried the mango juice and it was delicious. i believe they said it was just mango with ice and water. You could drink it with a straw, but it was thicker than just juice.   As i mentioned, there is a coupon for buy one, get one free up to $10 off in the 2012 Entertainment Book.",

    "text": "Living in Huntersville we don't venture down into Charlotte all too often, with plenty of good eats close to home. But word on the street was that Pio Pio was the place to pack in the poultry, and when a Groupon-esque deal came my way I just had to take advantage and see what the cluck everyone was talking about.  Pio Pio is hidden within a strip mall area, and not exactly the most likely place to find good eats. Don't let the location fool you...they are serving up fantastic food in that place! I like rotisserie chicken, be it from home, from Harris Teeter...heck, I'll even praise Boston Market! Yet the chicken at Pio Pio beats them all. We each got a 1/4 chicken combo and it was some of the best chicken I've ever had out. The chicken is succulent, moist, juicy, tender...basically cooked to perfection. The skin was an excellent, sinful indulgence that was too good to pass up. A combination of cooking technique and spices made this meal as good as it was. Here's a hint: let your server know if you prefer light or dark. Our server didn't ask and ended up placing a plate of dark meat in front of me and white meat in front of the miss'. Neither of us complained since that is what we would have ordered regardless, but I found it odd that they give different types of meat to customers without asking for preferences.   Not only is the chicken great but the sides were pretty banging too. Ever since moving to the area I've been relatively disappointed with the rice and beans at most of the Mexican restaurants. I was shocked to find that best I've had wasn't at a typical Mexican joint but at Pio Pio. The rice is cooked PERFECTLY, with the right flavor and, more importantly (to me), the right texture. The beans are not refried mush, but actual beans in a gravy. A helpful hint is to pour those bad boys right into the rice, and you have yourself one heck of a side dish.   The combo meal came with the chicken, rice, beans, and a choice of side. I chose to go with the yucca since I've never had it before, and I was glad I took the adventurous road. They fry the yucca like a french fry, but it's a thick brick instead of a little shoestring. The taste and texture is similar to a fry, but there's more substance to it, making it more filling. The miss' went with the plantains and they were down right tastetacular. Hot, sweet, carmelized plantains don't get much better than this. While I did enjoy the yucca, I would say the plantains are the way to go.  The chicken portion is slightly skimpy, but they fill you up with heaping helpings of sides. If you are a  connoisseur  of the poultry arts I highly recommend checking this place out. Great food and definitely worth the price!",

    "text": "Short review: eat here. The beans and rice alone are worth writing home about!  Longer review:  Be prepared for juicy rotisserie chicken, fried plantains, amazing beans and rice, addicting garlicky and jalapeno sauces, yucca fries, and more fried plantains!!!  Shared the satisfying and left-over producing Latin Combo with the girlfriend containing:  Salad: sizable salad with avocado and a darn good dressing that was rather unique!  Beans and Rice: Ooooooof, these were fantastic. Nothing at all like the beans and rice you may be accustomed to at Mexican restaurants (this is Peruvian food after all!). Seasoned stewed black beans with flavorful yellow rice that were obviously made in-house with pride. I could be happy with a meal of just these. Best beans and rice I've had in recent memory!   Chicken: No messing around here. You get a whole darn chicken rotisserieed to juicy perfection with just enough Peruvian spice to hold your attention and coming back for more.  Sauces: This really shifted the chicken from 'yummy' to 'hot dang'. Near the beginning of the meal two mystery sauces appear on the table. The white one is a creamy garlic sauce. I am gonna write to Crest to request this as a new flavor of toothpaste because I was challenged to find something in the meal that wasn't enhanced by it. The orangish sauce is jalapeno-based and I used a bit more sparingly, but was just fantastic (although perhaps not toothpaste-worthy).  Fried Plantains: Let these cool down a bit before eating; they absorb heat well enough to buffer spacecraft from re-entry into the atmosphere. Upon their cool-down, the fried, soft, sweetness of these plantains offered a nice contrast to the rest of the spicy and saucy meal. Although probably not intended to be, I was satisfied with these as a dessert.  Yucca Fires: whereas not bad at all, wasn't anything super-special in my opinion. Seemed rather close to steak-cut fries to me. Go for the tostones instead!  Tostones: we ordered these on the side, and were grateful for that. Akin to those fried banana chips you find in trail mix, tostones are mashed and fried plantains to a crispy-yet-chewy chip-like consistency. Great by themselves, awesome dipped in one of the aforementioned sauces, and fantastic when use as a shovel for beans, rice, chicken, and sauce. You will not be disappointed!",

No problem. We waited outside for 15 minutes. I went inside to check if our order was ready. Not yet. Fine. Another 5 minutes goes by. I go back in. Not ready yet. Then another 5 minutes (that's 25 minutes) goes by and I go in to check on the order. Nope. Not ready. So one of the waitresses said she'll bring it out to us when it's ready. Ten minutes later, I about lost all of my patience. So I tell my boyfriend to go inside. He finally comes out with the food and says they did not even apologize for the delay. As we were leaving, one of the waitresses brings out our yuca because they almost forgot to pack it in our bag. So I made sure to check the bag in case they got our order wrong or missed anything else. There were no utensils....so I had to go back inside to ask for some. Again, they weren't apologetic for being forgetful and slow. We drove 5 minutes to our destination to finally enjoy this food. But unfortunately everything was cold. So why did it take them 35 minutes to cook our food, for it to be cold?! I'm only giving this place 2 stars because we enjoyed the yuca. And that was the only thing fresh and hot.",

We were waiting to be sat at a small booth they were cleaning up for us when the hostess came over and told us very rudely that we there we needed to sit a a different table. Apparently, they wanted to save the booth for a larger party. I understand, but wouldn't it be better to ask us politely if we would sit at a different table instead? That set the tone for our meal. The service was slow and the employees are not engaging. Too many great restaurants in the area to accept the lack of customer service..... I won't be back.",

I am still going through the menu and wanting to try all of their offerings and sides.  If you are a fan of plantains, definitely give this place a visit since some of their combinations come with fried plantains.

Both times I've eaten there I've had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with either the sauteed yucca or the plantains, and I was stuffed and smiling.  Their salads are really nice too, they're topped with avocado slices and have a nice citrus dressing.   The service was a little harried when I was in for lunch, but it was relaxed and mellow when we were there for dinner, so just depends on when you go.  The prices are reasonable, not super cheap, but for what you get it's a good deal.  Needless to say, I'll be back again and soon, great meal and a great place for paleo types too.",

The yuca was far from fresh and it was not soft and it even had a little of a bitter taste to it, which usually means that  it is not fresh. Rice and beans were ok but nothing outstanding.  I think someone that has never tried any kind of Latin American food might like it since they don't have anything to compare it against with.

    "text": "Forget Viva Chicken! That place is like the McDonalds of burgers. Sure, it'll satisfy the craving in a jiffy but you're always left wanting a little something more. That's where Pio Pio comes in.   The specialty here is Peruvian chicken. It's a rotisserie style whole chicken marinated in spices and cooked to perfection. Sure they have other menu items and I've tried quite a few dishes but I always come back to the chicken. I prefer dark meat because it's more moist and flavorful than white meat but here, It doesn't even matter. The marinade seeps into every crevice of the chicken, making the meat extremely tender and delicious throughout.   Don't sleep on the sides now! Their saffron rice is cooked to perfection every time as well. I consider myself an expert on rice since I've been eating multiple variations of rice for breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks and even desserts. Trust me when I tell you the rice here is perfect! Fluffy grains colored by saffron strands, seasoned just a tad to elevate the natural rice flavors. I could eat a bowl of just the rice and be content. And the beans? Oh the beans! I'm not sure if they're pinto because it's larger in size than the pinto beans I've seen - whatever type of bean It is, It is outrageously good. Simmered in a stock with chunks of onions and bell peppers cooked down until It melts into the beans. Perfect balance of salty savory goodness. Lastly, the ripe plantains. I'm not big on overly sweet foods but the sweet plantains always serves as a great dessert at the end of the meal. I'm never left wanting after leaving here. Always 100% full!   I took a star off for the slow service. They were all very nice but were a little slow. The servers don't appear to be assigned tables but they all work the entire restaurant. That leaves room for a lot of miscommunication. It took forever and two different requests for the bill. Our drinks were never refilled and no one came to check on us, I kept having to wave down someone for one thing or another. If doing takeout, I'd give them a full 5 stars!",

She proceeded to dismiss me and walk right by it, not even stepping on the bug. Maybe his happens all the time....  So Pio Pio is a chain but it sure feels like a small business. The small strip mall setting combine with a random mix of decorations makes you feel like this was someone's recipes passed down from mother to son.   When you walk in the smell hits you and you immediately get hungry. The music is loud so the conversations are also loud. The TV in the corner had the news on both times I was there. This is not a first date type of dinner.   Chicken is their specialty and by the smell I'm sure it's awesome. I stuck with the grilled steak that was topped with sauteed onions; oh so good. The sauces on the table are a nice compliment to the tostones you can get for a side. Other sides like the yucca and a classic French fry are also good. The rice and beans are basic but so special with the layers of flavors.   They have a busy take out business which is appealing since the seating is somewhat limited and the loud atmosphere isn't for everyone.",

    "text": "I think I've figured out the problem with latin restaurants in Charlotte....they have no identity. I originally came here thinking it was a Peruvian restaurant, but it was difficult determining their specialty once sitting in the restaurant.    Immediately I noticed the Colombian music playing in the background which are little details that you become aware of with dining out as often as I do. Assuming they were Peruvian we both ordered Chicha Morada (a common Peruvian drink made of purple corn) but unfortunately they didn't serve it. We also noticed they didn't serve us \"Cancha\" which is a commonly served snack consisting of fried corn kernels.   At this point I've realized we were not in a Peruvian restaurant, but decided to go ahead and try it anyway. We ordered the traditional Lomo Saltado which was horrendous! Absolutely no similarities to an AUTHENTIC Peruvian Lomo Saltado.   We also ordered the Pork Chops w/ white rice, red beans and plantains which was mediocre at best. The pork chops were thin and dry, lacking any real flavor. Now to the inexperienced patron they would have no idea if they're eating Colombian food, Peruvian food, Dominican food, Cuban food of Nicaraguan food, but there's a big difference.   You can't have a restaurant that serves Colombian, Peruvian, Ecuadorian and Dominican food!! Stick to one specialty and do it correctly!",

    "text": "Let's just start by saying Pio Pio has fulfilled one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves!!! They now charge for extra sauce!!! .25 cents for each additional cup of sauce.   This is not my first time here but I have been cheating on them with another Peruvian chicken restaurant. Tonight I decided to grab a dinner for my family cause I trust the quality and taste of their food and I knew one of the combos would satisfy my whole family. Plus they are open til 10pm which allows me to go after work at 9pm.   From order to pick up I would say 15 minutes elapsed. I was a little annoyed when I arrived and saw the posted extra sauce charge. How am I suppose to know how much sauce I need?? My family loves condiments ... how many extras will I need for everyone. I decided on an extra 2 of each sauce. Adding another dollar to my bill.   Overall I was satisfied with what I ordered. The food was tasty and the portions were good.   I'm not sure if this is going to go back to my regular Peruvian Chicken spot of choice but here are a few pros and cons for this establishment.   PRO: *open til 10pm *large portions *simple menu  CONS: *extra sauce charge *doesn't work well with larger groups",

So one thing you need to know before you go any further with this review. They have the best plantains in all of Charlotte that I am currently aware of right now.   The place is inmate and cozy with one small television. I have been multiple times and it has been awhile since I been back though . I can say they have consistently good tasting food.   If you don't like flavorful food turn around and stop reading this now and choose another place. The food has intense flavors and it taste like it was cooked in someone kitchen like a street food feel but in a restaurant .   The rice is so good I could eat that with every meal from now on. I have tried a couple things but I recommend the chicken ! 1/4  is a good size but if you are really hungry go for the 1/2 size !   Get out of your comfort zone and eat some good Peruvian food. You will not be disappointed.",

The service was great and the food was great also. I had the 1/2 chicken dinner. It came with rice and beans and tostones. I also had a natural fruit drink that was fantastic I think it was fruit punch or something but it was great also. Trust me  Different day: this time I went there and ordered a chicken wrap with fries. The service was very slow this time and the server didn't come back to check on us unless she was called. I had to all up to the servers counter to place an additional order for something else I wanted. Now for the chicken wrap, it was different from what I was expecting their wrap came with rice in it and instead of lettuce and tomato like I'm used to. It wasn't bad just different. If I would've know this up front I wouldn't have ordered it cause I wanted the traditional wrap. Just a FYI so attached a pic.",

We order the Latin combo to enjoy a family size meal with multiple sides.   Don't overlook the chicken soup, which they serve year round and is delicious with corn, potatoes and yucca.   The various Latin sides are prepared well and everything is extremely consistent. The house sauces they serve is good for the chicken, dipping fried yucca and plantains in as well as for salad dressing.  Warning:  the green sauce is VERY hot. Take a tiny finger taste before deciding how much to use. The white sauce is mild and delicious!  Dining in?  Try the red sangria!",

For a small meal for two you're paying north of 45 bucks for a small amount of food. You're getting 85% rice too by the way.   2-beans are very watery, I had to drain them my self. Why is it so watery? It's like they literally dumped them from a can, warmed them up and gave them to their customers  3-customer service is mediocre at best. They are not helpful to new customers or people not familiar with Peruvian food.   The foods tasty, but I don't think it's worth another go. Good to try, but not as a reoccurring customer.  *food might be 15 bucks but you're still getting mostly just rice, even for an entree. I jumped it to 40 because you need to order an overpriced appetizer (like the paltry serving of tostones for example) so it's somewhat filling  *Beans might or might not be fresh, but they are still watery and soupy.",

Which are wonderful Peruvian inspired places right here in the great city of Charlotte! If you come here with the desire of comparing one place to another then you are doing it wrong. You should come here with an open attitude and a great appetite.   We visited on a Wednesday evening and we were able to walk in and sit wherever we wanted. There were probably about 6 tables already taken. We were greeted by a very energetic man who had a great attitude the entirety of our visit. We were serviced by three different people, all of which were extremely courteous and helpful.   I ordered the breaded steak and my girlfriend ordered the arroz con pollo with vegetables. Both were cooked wonderfully. Looking at the steak I was worried it would be dry but it was definitely cooked by an expert and was delicious.   To wrap things up I have nothing but positive things to say. The atmosphere is great. The workers were all nice and seemed to work together great. The food was awesome and we will definitely be coming back! Not to mention while we were there we saw foodie call come in at least twice!",

My white meat, upcharge, chicken was smoking like it left the microwave and the arm/leg of the wing was so dry it was crisp. Look for the pictures.   What saves the day? The salad with the white sauce and the steak.  The salad is the most basic yet its refreshing for these summer days.   The skirt steak is marinated well, comes with the right condiments and has a nice flavor. I didn't find monfongo which I wanted yet was quite nervous to eat it outside the Caribbean hoping it tasted like everything I recalled yet this location doesn't carry it. The website boasts a monfongo with shrimp so I will return for that and to try their tostadas.",

This is a Charlotte gem. The place was packed on Saturday night, but we were able to be seated after a pretty quick wait.  My boyfriend and I were deciding between a few choices and sides, but then he spotted the Latin American combo: a full rotisserie chicken, yuca, plantains, salad, and rice & beans for $27. That is a steal. We had no idea about portion size so also got an arepa with sausage. The sausage was a link on the side, not in the arepa, and it was amazing. Kind of chorizo-esque with a good kick. The salad had a big portion of avocado and a delicious dressing. The CHICKEN, my goodness, the chicken. Amazing. We ate ourselves silly and still had a big box of leftovers to take home. Oh, and the sangria is pretty delish, too.  See you soon, Pio Pio!",

The staff is very friendly. I had the \"Montanero\", which is the name that they gave their \"Bandeja Paisa\". Everything was great with the exception of the steak. And my only complaint about the steak is that it wasnt churrasco (skirt steak), which is the cut im used to having. My girlfriend had the Lomo Saltado. Everything about the dish tasted great but it definitely was not your traditional Lomo Saltado. This is a very good spot for anybody who grew up around Latin culture and eating Latin food. I was feeling a bit homesick and this place took me right back to Miami with the music, food, and beverage selection. Unfortunately they don't offer Malta Hatuey or Jupina on their drink menu but then again those ARE Cuban drinks and their menu is Colmbian/Peruvian for the most part. PIO PIO is about 25 minutes away from my house but I will be driving back soon.",

As a long time fan of the food I have a love/hate relationship of this place because food is great but service is not very friendly or welcoming....reminds me of an old ex- boyfriend that treats you bad but you can't help but to wanna go back haha. The food alone gets 4-5 stars. The rotisserie chicken is great, food is seasoned just right, and I love their rice. I almost alway order the Montanero platter...yum! BUT the service gets 2 stars.... the servers always look unhappy and miserable, like they don't want you there. Kinda ruins the experience!  I'm waiting for the day another similar place opens so I can cut my ties for good. Until now, I will continue this abusive relationship because the food is that good lol.",

The overall atmosphere is quaint if not intimate; a bit on the smallish size....could use some better lighting.  Nothing to complain about regarding the service; the staff are very much friendly, engaged and enjoyable.  As for the food, all I can say is WOW!!  Enjoyed some of the rotisserie chicken with red beans & rice, and some of their fried yucca....absolutely amazing!!  They provide a couple of sauces, one of which is a thin jalapeno sauce that is da bomb!  I def plan to return here and try some more!!",

I did enjoy the Yuca and the salad that comes with the combos. Service, however, was HORRIBLY SLOW. We went at 8pm on a Friday night. A large group of people stood huddled by the door waiting to put our names on a list and wondering why the hostess wasn't seating people at the two empty tables available. After sitting, it took about ten minutes before someone stopped by to get our drink orders.",

    "text": "PIO PIO! Fun to say.   Ok I'll get this straight from the start: If you go here and you are vegetarian, don't expect a smorgasbord of options. Expect exactly 0 options, unless you modify something. They have 1 thing on the menu you can easily order (the #2) and you have to change out the chicken soup for salad. Or you can order all sides, but they are each about $4 so it adds up quick for a few veggies.   That said: My salad was delicious and thoughtful, with a nice home made creamy dressing and everything chopped and lovely, not a cheap iceburg lettuce salad a lot of places throw your way. (side note: it was stuffed into a small bowl overflowing, which is fine, but that always gives me anxiety because you have to be careful not to look like a pig spilling salad out of a tiny bowl onto your table, and I'm a pig who spills things all the time so this is a touch-n-go mix for me, give me a big plate!).   The plantains were DELICIOUS. Holy bejesus. Fried to a light crisp and so fresh and sweet! I actually had MORE plantains than I could eat. I didn't think that was possible.   Beyond that they served me a fresh avocado half, and some tasty rice. The rice was a bit plain but they had a spicy buttery sauce that I mixed in and it jacked it up nicely. It was a very healthy lunch and well prepared.   A bit pricy for lunch, since I forked up $11 after tip, but ok on occasion to do that.",

It came with a whole chicken so both the white and dark meat, plantains, rice and beans, and a salad. Overall I thought it was a good bang for the buck. We also had a couple glasses of Sangria it really wasn't that bad, I guess they also have a pretty good drink specials since it was a buy one get one deal (might be on certain days a Wednesday in this case) we both enjoyed the drink as well.

    "text": "If you show up at Pio Pio expecting anything resembling Viva Chicken then I'm going to kindly ask that, before you reach the front door, you should turn right around and head back to your car (and then drive to your nearest Viva Chicken).  Pio Pio is situated in the shopping center containing Fresh Market off of East Blvd. It has a shared parking lot so there is plenty of parking spaces to choose from. I had some time to kill before an event on a weeknight so I decided to finally give Pio Pio a try after so many rave recommendations.  I walked right in around 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday and it was not crowded at all. Granted this place is very small so, at peak times, I can imagine that it gets very tight in there. I was seated (party of one, thankyouverymuch) and the waiter came by to take my drink order. I happen to love various juices provided at Latin restaurants so I ordered the mango juice which comes with an option to add water or milk. I added water and it was sweet but not overbearingly so. I placed my order for their #2 dinner special which is chicken soup, plantains, half of an avocado and rice.  My food was brought out and I immediately dove into the soup. I'm trying to keep those nasty flu and cold viruses away so soup was what I was craving. It was very flavorful and filled with chunks of potatoes, small piece of corn on the cob, chicken, cilantro and a few other things. Very hearty and delicious soup! The rice was perfectly cooked and the plantains were so delicious that I'm considering calling up and ordering a side of only those.  Pio Pio is more of a Latin American restaurant covering dishes from various countries in South America. It's not one or the other. Pio Pio has a style and flavor all its own. I recommend you stopping by and giving them a try for yourself!",

The staff was very friendly and quick with the food. They also had good deals on drinks when we went on a weekend for an early dinner.  It wasn't too busy when we went around 7pm bu there were a lot of people picking up to go order. We also received a coupon with our receipt for our next visit.",

    "text": "Warning: DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM HERE  Pio Pio is decent Colombian food. I have always had a fine experience dining in. Awful customer service, most of the people that work here are miserable. The food is much more expensive than other Colombian restaurants in town, but they cater to a Dilworth crowd, so I can't blame them.   But we have ordered take out from here about six times. And they get my order wrong every single time. They leave something out consistently. They owe me at least $50 in food, if not more. Today I ordered through Postmates and they left out 2 itemsbut at least Postmates refunded me. When I order straight through them, they barely offer to fix the issue other than to ask me to come back. Never again.   Quick update: Went to tell them about my issues and they basically told me they know they have issues with getting orders straight but they have no way of confirming that I am telling the truth. Took 40 mins to get everything sorted out but it was such a trying experience, I will never be back.  For Colombian good, do yourself a favor and go to Mi Tierra and for Peruvian, just go to Viva Chicken. Pio Pio is not worth the hassle or experience.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner after a training in Fort Mills after reading some positive reviews on Yelp. This location is located in a strip mall that offers tons of parking and is a small Peruvian restaurant. The workers seem to be Peruvian themselves and we were quickly seated and handed our menus. We order the Montanero which is a platter of rice, beans, steak, crispy pork belly, sausage, egg, and avocado. Needless to say, the platter was huge and offered a tasting of a little bit of everything. In addition we ordered a whole deep fried red snapper that was crispy, and meaty, and not at all greasy. Served along side two sauces, one white garlic sauce and one spicy green sauce, everything was hot, cooked well and delicious. I was in love with the fresh green sauce that added a nice zip to all of the heavy components on the table. The service was attentive and they came to check on us many times. We came here around 7pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. It seems like more people stop here to pick up dishes like rotisserie chicken rather than come here for a sit down meal. Prices are pretty fair but I can't say that this restaurant was any different than other Spanish restaurants I've been to in the past.",

They have 2 dipping sauces, a garlic white sauce and green jalapeno sauce. At first the jalapeno sauce seemed mild but trust me it creeps up on you then BAM! The heat comes! Both were very tasty. Rice and beans were underwhelming, but I came for the chicken and that didn't dissapoint. Very juicy and flavorful. I'm a white meat kinda guy, and their's was very moist. As you all know there is an art to making the white meat moist on a chicken. Bravo Pio Pio!",

I mixed the rice with beans and the AWESOME two side sauces (they had a kick to it) and it was a perfect meal.  I'm not a big fan of yucca but you had the choice of yucca, tostones, plantains and I just chose yucca because I never had it before. It tasted like thick bread with a lots of fibers.   It was a heavy lunch and I don't think I will come back for lunch. Yes to dinner, No to lunch. I felt so lethargic during work.",

I thus have high standards for Peruvian and went into this Pio Pio with high expectations.  Nonetheless it was good enough for me to give it 3 stars, My friends who did not have a point of reference for this food liked it much more than i did and gave it 4 stars.  The arepa was made of white corn,  I found it to be a little tasteless aside from the cheese. The roasted chicken was good and I got it with fried yuca. What really turned me off was their Lomo Saltado. In the many places that I've had this dish before, the fries are sauteed in with the meat, but here they were served on the side. I find the quirkiness of the fries in the in the meat to be what makes the dish so alluring and unique, so taking that away took a lot for me. Overall, the place wasn't bad.

It was in fact delicious however I was also not 100% blown away (probably because I have had Peruvian food before). I got the arroz con pollo (rice with chicken) and my boyfriend got 1/4 chicken with rice and beans. We also had the ripe plantains which were amazing. They give you a lot of food and we were stuffed afterwards! Now to the negatives...having gone to Viva Chicken before Pio Pio is more expensive with not toooooo much of a difference, so I can't justify spending more on something that tastes just as good with the same amount of food. Plus Viva Chicken gives you UNLIMITED FREE sauce! I did not like having to pay .25 extra for every sauce. It's not a big deal, but if you like sauce like me then it is a game changer to pay more for the food as well as pay more for additional sauces. Since this is down the block from my house I am sure I'll go back, but in the mean I'm probably sticking with Viva..sorry Pio!",

I've had the dish we ordered before at this little hole in the wall where no one spoke English and it was a much larger plate for a much cheaper price. How depressing, also I find the cost of a 1/4 rotisserie chicken plate kind of prohibitive. How is a plate of chicken and rice almost $10!? I can go buy a whole chicken and some rice and have enough food for a couple days!  For those days you are too tired to cook and want a quick comforting meal I can see going here, they're open late and they're friendly. Rotisserie chicken and rice is not hard to make though so I don't know about going here all the time but it's A-OK for those lazy days.",

    "text": "Pio Pio was recommended by a friend a few months ago. A group of us went to dinner there and shut the place down. They have affordable wine and sangria, and it is not loud at all, so it's the perfect place for a casual dinner with friends.  And the food is amazing. If you've never been you definitely need to get the chicken on your first trip. The rice and beans are so good (some restaurants just mail those traditional sides in) and they are seasoned well with saffron (rice) and whatever is in the beans I just want to drink up. The ripe plantains and tostones are excellent as well. And the chicken is deliciously roasted and the skin is nice and crispy. The side sauces they bring To the table with your meal are the perfect accompniant: ones has a slow burn spiciness and the other is mild for those who don't like spicy (as a tip, they make great dipping sauces for your plantains and tostones).  On my most recent visit we went for lunch, so unfortunately no wine or sangria was involved. I ordered the salad for a bit lighter option, with a side of tostones (obvi). The salad was fresh and delicious and I basically hit the avocado jackpot (I think there was a whole sliced avocado on my salad). My salad was made complete with a generous helping of shredded chicken on top. The tostones were crispy and satisfying.  I would not go her all the time because I would probably order chicken in some variety, but when I have a craving for well made chicken and rice, this is my spot.",

We loved how moist  and tender the chicken was, yet it really lacked a lot of seasoning. We both are no big fans of sodium, yet this chicken could use a little more pizzazz. The sauces helped with this flavor issue, but sauces should enhance and not make the flavor IMO. Well the prices were decent and the flavored teas were tasty. We will definitely come back, but not somewhere we will be jonesing for. :)",

We(the bf and I) stumbled across it while walking from freedom park we were originally going to try big daddy's but decided to keep on walking a little to see what else was in the area. I'm SO glad we stopped when we did.  We decided to sit outside and ordered a whole chicken ( not knowing how huge the portion was going to be) for 9 bucks! A whole chicken= $9 i mean c'mon that's a freakin steal. Not to mention this is the best rotisserie chicken in Charlotte! It was perfect! Juicy just enough spices nothing overpowering. These ppl are True artists! We also ordered a side of rice and beans( yum just like mami used to make) maduros( sweet plantains) and a chicken empanada. My bf ordered the mango juice which was outta this world! It's making my mouth water just thinking about the feast we had. Oh and I had the inka cola:) I really hope this place gets good business and stays open. The service was fabulous! They were so attentive but not overbearing. What can I say this place was PERFECT! I have to tell everyone I know to stop in to make sure this place stays open so you do the same:)  P.S. I almost forgot about the garlic sauce....OMG if you don't try anything just ask for some sauce. YUM!!!",

My meal selection was the Filet of Tilapia with rice & beans and Yuca...YUMMY!  The fish was crisply baked (not blackened) and full of flavor.  The rice & beans were tasty and the Yuca was great as well.  I didn't each much all day so that my tummy would be ready to receive some good food and it was not disappointed.  The restaurant was not crowded on this weeknight and service was excellent.  Although I didn't time it, the food seemed to come out in 10 minutes or less - I am not sure how they did that but I like their style.  This is a nice (authentic Peruvian, Columbian, Spanish & Latin American) restaurant in the back of the Plaza with Outback and Black Lion.  They have a kids' menu with traditional fare such as chicken fingers, chicken leg, frankfurter which means I can go back for a nother visit really soon, with the kids.",

    "text": "I actually love Pio Pio's food, but I will never patronize them again after tonight. Tried to place a pickup order, which had a few hiccups in itself. When we went to pick up, we got a very weird cold vibe, with the employees we dealt with not making eye contact or saying more than 2 words to us. After waiting a little too long to get our order that was already sitting on the counter, the guy opens each box and verbally confirms what we ordered. Getting home, one entire half of our order was actually just a big salad that we did not order...he definitely saw this. We called back and said we are coming back to get our chicken, will it be ready when we get there? Yes of course. Arrive back at Pio Pio and, just kidding, they are out of chicken (yeah right). Obviously angry at this point and asking for a refund, they said they didn't run the card so there's no need, when we earlier watched them run it and signed for it. We asked for some kind of proof of this, and they could provide none. Whether the charge shows up or not, we believe that they saw that the order was wrong, didn't feel like re-making anything at closing time, and sent us home knowing that. Why they told us to come back to the restaurant only to turn us away 5 minutes later I don't know.   It was nice know you, Pio Pio, but I'll just drive farther to get this kind of food from someplace that is run by people who give a crap from now on.",

We got arepas for appetizers and they weren't really authentic like the areaps joint in NYC. It tasted fine but not really arepas.  I got 1/4 rotisserie chicken and hubby got the grilled chicken breast. The meat was really tender and flavorful. The spicy green chillie sauce and the garlic sauce given on the side were amazing! I agree with Albert though...they are a bit on the pricier end for the amount food you get. If you want more sauce you have to pay extra which is really annoying.  The service was polite and quick. Hubby loved the food so much, he keeps wanting to go back again soon :o)",

I went to Pio Pio in order to experience the rotisserie chicken and when I asked for white meat I was told by the waiter they were out and if I wanted white meat I should've arrived earlier. Being that it was only 6:30 and the waiter was EXTREMELY rude to me I asked to speak with the manager. To my horror he said he WAS the manager. I expressed my disappointment with the shortage of white meat at a restaurant known for, hello-CHICKEN and also his tone when speaking to customers. He was aggressive and downright rude. He shrugged his shoulders and gave the most insincere apology I've ever heard. I will NEVER go back to this establishment. To be spoken to by a manager like that was completely unacceptable!!! And besides- the food wasn't THAT good. My advice, if you prefer white meat arrive as soon as the doors open OR just go to VIVA CHICKEN instead.",

The chicken fell off the bone and was tender - but it really tasted as good as the ones at Harris Teeter available at a much lower price. The rice and beans were good but I didn't think anything that special. The salad did have four small slices of avocado which was nice -and was served with that really good (white) sauce intended for the chicken as well.  I'm not sure my chicken was quite worth over $10, so I probably would opt for something else for lunch.",

Their rice is saffron rice, not your usually plain white or garlic white rice. Chicken is lightly seasoned than average but still has that Peruvian kick.

Normally, I'm afraid to try a different dish at any restaurant because I always end up liking what other people ordered or what I ordered previously more. Luckily, this place never fails me! EVERYTHING MUST BE GOOD! Every dish is unique and original because they make all of their spices and sauces in-house, The portions are huge and I think most of their dishes come with rice and plantain. This is by far the BEST rotisserie chicken I have ever had! The plantain is also amazing. There are 2 kinds, the ripe, sweet plantain and the fried, green plantain. It depends on your preference, but both are delicious!   The restaurant's interior has a very cultural, homey vibe. The walls are decorated with beautiful paintings, in combination with warm lighting. It is a family-owned restaurant and you definitely get that cozy feel. Definitely try this place out if you're in the area!",

I mean no taste at all - the dipping sauce - tomato based - didn't really help at all! At this point I was somewhat regretting my decision to dine here but the entree saved the day despite a few flubs - we ordered the montanero which is sort of a sampler dish - pork belly cooked perfectly, skirt steak over cooked (flub #1) since we asked for medium rare, chorizo sausage delicious  rice fresh avocado  plantains cooked perfectly and sweet beans I think pinto very flavorful arepa like a roll bland and a fried egg (flub #2) we like a soft yellow and cooked white it was all cooked thru but in their defense we didn't specify how we wanted the egg   - my hubby had two beers and I had the house cab- not the best dining experience but not the worst we would prob go back to try a few other things but definitely skip the calamari or coconut  for sure",

We also wanted to order something green to go with the protein and we ordered (take out order) the \"mixed vegetables.\" Was quite surprised to open the container to see what I can only describe as school cafeteria mixed veggies with the standard cut green beans, corn, peas, and cubed carrots. With chicken this good, how could Pio Pio do this and go cheap on this side dish. I hope they make the decision to put half the effort in the mixed veggies as they do their chicken. Try saute mixed vegetables with fresh broccoli, zucchini, carrots, etc.  There is a new Fresh Market that just opened up beside them and thus no excuses to serve that bland canned stuff. I will go back cuz that chicken is just that good.",

There have been a couple other rotisserie joints that have opened up but I must say I keep going back to this one time and time again. Here's a couple items that I enjoy:  The chicken is obviously on point, they know what they are doing here. The chicken empanadas are pretty darn good, crispy on the outside but have a great flavor on the inside and aren't greasy at all. The tostones and plantains are pretty decent, but the yucca is a bit stringy sometimes and can disappoint. The salad is spot on, nice avocado and the white sauce compliments it well. The green sauce is one of my favorites but is really inconsistent, some days it's tolerable hot and some days it's going to burn your face off but I enjoy that.   Nonetheless, for a inexpensive, good quality meal Pio Pio nails it for me every single time.",

    "text": "I didn't actually do the rotisserie chicken here, even though that's their specialty. My friend doesn't like bones! So we had a few other dishes and shared a lot. The service was attentive, prompt, and friendly. The atmosphere is basic. On to the food reviews: * Green and white table sauces: The green has a nice kick to it. The white is somewhat tangier. You could mix them together or enjoy them each separately. They're darn good, but I wouldn't say you would drink them by the ounce (i.e. they seemed to be slightly overhyped based on what I was told by my friend). * Arepa: 3.5 stars. Pretty standard, average stuff. No seared flavor, it is merely a vessel. * Tostones: 3.5 stars. Same as above. They lose heat quickly and end up a bit hard. * Sweet plantains: 5 stars. They have a delicious sugary burnt crisp to the edge, unlike most places where they end up mushy. Definitely order this as one of your sides. * Rice: 4 stars. It's rice. It's nice rice. * Pork skin: 4+ stars. Nothing outstanding, but it's done right. Maybe a little on the smallish side. Pork skins are always at least 4 stars when done right. * Chicken soup: 4.5 stars. You may want to add salt, but be sure not to overwhelm the subtle spices that lend the broth an extraordinary flavor. I did find it slightly bland, but I'm not deducting any stars for a restaurant that chooses to let you salt to taste instead of deciding how much sodium you need. * Side salad: *shrug* It's a salad. It's got decent size to it, but it is what it is.  Good stuff, and a change from the usual. If you're afraid to try new cuisines, you can get enough familiar foods here to test the waters before diving in. Give it a shot.",

Although it was really crowded and the food took a little bit to come out it was worth the wait.

All of it was good but I wasn't blown away like people suggested I would be.  Honestly I found the chicken a little greasy, the sauces overly spicy where it was more of an accomplishment to eat rather than an enjoyable accomplice to the meal (and I regularly eat spicy food) and the beans to be not worth my time.  The plantains were delicious and the ther servers were very attentive. One nice thing that they did was they did not have enough plantains for both of our plates. So, they gave me my portion and put two on my friend's plate so they could get the meals out. They then brought a side plate with the rest of the plantains when they were finished. It was a well thought out move on the part of the staff.  My friend had the chicken soup and said it was very very good especially when she spooned some broth into the rice and mashed in some avacado.  This place is certainly worth checking out, and a place I'll likely return to, but did not like enough to be a regular.",

We give him a heads up that they ran out of food, but he proceeds anyway to put in a to-go order. We were shocked by this revelation and my friend walked back in to confront the host for lying to us. Of course, at the same moment, two police officers walk in to pick up their orders. The conversation got heated, but the police officers told us to just go write a review and essentially intimidated us into leaving by telling us we were a \"disturbance.\" We left soon after because honestly I don't have enough funds for bail money. I have nothing but respect for the police, but the points of this post are 1) avoid Pio Pio Rotisserie Chicken Charlotte at all costs and 2) know that when someone tells you being black in America can make you sometimes feel like a second-class citizen with no rights or voice, believe them.",

I loved the rice and beans and the plantains. The meat was tasty but a little on the greasy side for my taste.

I haven't tried that yet but I did try the Jalea special, a wonderful seafood platter including both calamari and tilapia in a lime/tomato sauce with corn and onions that is simply delicious. I also sampled the mango juice, an arepa with cheese and a beef patty. The beef patty was a real standout. Two sauces, a garlic sauce and a green sauce are served with every meal - both really add a lot of flavor and probably go great with the chicken. I definitely plan on coming back to Pio Pio soon to try the chicken and other Peruvian / Colombian specialties offered.",

Was it bad? No it was not really bad but was it good, No not that either. It was a strip mall shop that has chicken exactly like the Rotisserie Chicken from Harris Teeter only more expensive. We ordered the Whole chicken...but it was just he four pieces...two small breasts with part of a wing attached and two thighs..No idea where the legs went ---or why they were not included in the WHOLE chicken. Then I ordered the ChimiChurri Sauce...4 dollars. Wilkepedia describes Chimichurri as :Chimichurri is made from finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, and white or red vinegar. Additional flavorings such as cilantro, paprika, cumin, thyme, lemon, and bay leaf. What we received was a small dish of chopped onion in water...no green anything. Very disappointed. The fried Tostones were very thin and crisp..I liked them but not enough to make me go back to Pio Pio...I will just get a chicken at Costco or Harry Teets if I am craving Rotisserie Chicken again...Sorry Pio Pio..you did not make my list!",

If I lived in the neighborhood and wanted an easy, inexpensive dinner, I'd be a frequent patron.  Tips:  Corn pancakes with cheese (arepa) are worth trying, but I don't know if I'd order again.  Given the price, we ordered 2, but 1 would have been more than enough.  I would skip the mixed vegetables - they looked like the frozen kind you get to make soup.  Plantains were extraodinary - almost desert-like.  My husband had the tostones, which were good, but not as good as the plantains.  Rice was very good; sometimes rice is a generic afterthought, but I really liked theirs.  I liked the Sangria, but if you're an anti-pulp person like me, you may not appreciate the tiny pieces of crunchy fruit (apple?) floating in it.  Last, beware of the hot green sauce!  A small taste will carry you through the rest of the meal.  Ambiance:  dark interior with a small bar and TVs on the wall.  Small outdoor seating area facing the parking lot.

I hate to knock a restaurant for mediocre service, but as soon as we sat down, it took fifteen minutes to get drinks, and another table received their food despite arriving after us. This was on a Tuesday night, they were only moderately busy, and they do not require reservations. No excuses, the staff was friendly, but the service was very slow. The papaya juice was nauseating. Maybe it was my palate, but the milk with it tasted rancid. Drinks and service aside, the food is above average. I ordered the 1/4 chicken dinner with beans and plantains. The saffron rice complements the chicken well, and the beans are flavorful and filling, albeit a little too salty. The chicken is excellent, tender and juicy, but not as large of a portion as I had hoped. The redeeming factor is their plantains, sweet and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could eat a bucket of these, they were seriously that good! And the dipping sauces are great too, but for some reason they were brought with the drinks, thirty minutes before our food was brought. Weird. It's hard to find restaurants like this in Charlotte, certainly unique, and overall pretty tasty. Just don't waste two hours of your time eating there, do what the locals do and order it to go.",

    "text": "The restaurant was as large as a matchbox.  There was a large party waiting for sitting, which means they completely blocked the doorway and were talking over the unfortunate patrons eating dinner right under them.  My husband and made our way through the crowd and sat at the \"bar\" to wait on our family's take out order.  When I say  bar....the only two stools situated by the register.  With that being said, what this restaurant lacks in size it more than makes up for in taste.  We ordered a couple of whole chickens (VERY MOIST!) , yellow rice, beans, fried yucca, sweet plantains, and tostodas.  We loved  the garlic and chili sauces! I had visited a PIO PIO serval years ago in Queens, NY and thought it was ok.  But this foodie experience was awesome!!",
