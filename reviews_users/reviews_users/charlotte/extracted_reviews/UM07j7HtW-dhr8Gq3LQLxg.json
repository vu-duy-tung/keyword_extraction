If you wrap a to go order of wet green beans in paper, and then place them in a paper bag with other food, that paper bag will drain all over the vehicle that they are traveling in, only to explode out of the bottom of the bag when reaching the destination.  Which then of course becomes a fun night of cleaning up a nasty mess of food.",

The okay-tea was sweet and the food got there fast The bad-silverskin not taken off the ribs, pork chop was way overdone and dry The awful-baked beans had a weird aftertaste, kinda like garlic powder maybe; and the cole slaw was the consistency of mashed potatoes. I ordered the combo of ribs and pork chop. My wife got the pulled pork small sandwich. First thing I noticed when I got the ribs was the silverskin. It is tough and should always be removed. I asked the waitress about this and she had no idea but said that was the way they cook the ribs. I pulled it off and the rest was just okay. My wife did like the fact that they had Frank's Red Hot sauce and bbq sauce at the table and says her sandwich was okay as well. Even though this place is on the way home from work I do not think we will be going back.",

The rib meat is extremely tender. I will say that the baked beans or nothing special. The barbeque sandwhich was good too. I'll definitely be back.",

The waitress was very apologetic about the delay.  A man, who I assume was the manager, came over to apologize for the wait and informed us he was taking 25% off the bill.   The delay is the only reason 521 did not receive 5 stars.  Hopefully on my next visit I can upgrade them to a 5.",

My wife thinks the hush puppies are the best around.  Crispy and moist to go with the flavor.    After trying the fort mill area bbq, 521 is hands down the best.  I prefer the smoking pig in rock hill or Mac's in Charlotte, but both locations of 521 are right up there.

    "text": "We have been to 521 Barbeque several times both the fort Mill (Tega Cay) and the Indian Land location this was by far the worst experience I have had at one of their restaurants. When we arrived it was a party of five adults and one three-year-old we were told the inside was full of want to sit outside it would be faster service so we elected to sit outside. We are seated at a picnic table and it was at least 10 minutes before anyone came to even take our drink orders.     It went downhill from there we had at least three different waitresses I still can't tell you who our real waitress was they finally came back and took our food orders and brought the drinks and dropped a basket of hush puppies no napkins no utensils no nothing just the hush puppy in a basket on the table.          It was just about an hour from the time we seated until we got our first servings of food and they said they would be coming right out with the three-year-olds Mac and cheese. It was another 10 minutes with two trips from the manager saying they were coming right out before she got her mac & cheese it got to the point where she turned to her grandmother and started crying because everyone else had their food but not her.      We had to ask for utensils we had asked for napkins two of the people ordered ribs they weren't given any extra napkins no wipes like you normally get when you order ribs. I had to get up and walk inside the building to get napkins so that they could clean their hands.    Everyone's barbecue was cold it wasn't even lukewarm. I talked to the manager briefly because I was so upset I was afraid what I would say, she did discount our bill but that's not the point the service was absolutely horrendous and the food was mediocre at best because it was cold.     Like I said at the beginning we have been to their barbecue for many years but it will take a lot of convincing  to get me to go back again at least to the Fort Mill location.",

    "text": "This is a new location near us and it's nice to have local food by local folks. The inside is well done. Nice decorations and new.  I could do without the big dirty BBQ pit out front spilling out smoke as you walk in. I also don't know who is in thinks is a quality BBQ joint using KINGSFORD wood and charcoal? Really? Are you serious? You are using store wood and stuff? That's not how you do BBQ.  I want to eat BBQ not smell like it. Plus the idea that my lunch is being transported from the parking lot to the kitchen....NO!  The inside is arrange really funny. There is this dedicated BAR area which seems to be the focus inside and then the side where the people who come to eat BBQ sit. What is the focus BBQ or BAR. Pick on and try to do it well and stop doing both. It's the BOTH that gets people into trouble. Do one thing GREAT and do it all the time. Stop trying to be everything. The menu reflect this mess as well.   So the sign says BBQ but the inside says BAR. It's kind of confusing.  The menu is a mess. There is BBQ but then you have all this other stuff and I guess that's the BAR side or the GRILL side of things.  BBQ joints should be a half page of perfection in big print. Make BBQ and make it well but stop all the other stuff no one wants and if it comes in a freezer bag in a truck you are doing BBQ wrong!  I had the LARGE BBQ Sam'ich and my son had the Pork Chop Sam'ich.  So while we were waiting other people came in and were served drinks and then served meals while we waited. There was about a 15 min. wait for the food. My BBQ showed up and the bun was cold. Very cold. Never heated up cold. Been sitting out on the counter cold. The meat was a bit warmer but I am guessing not the right temp at all. Loads of meat but the bun being cold was not good. The server seemed confused when I told her and offered to heat it up? My question was \"Do you warm the buns\" and she said she didn't know.  The Pork Chop Sam'ich didn't taste like anything at all. It was boring. Tasted like I would have made them at home. I don't go out to eat to eat stuff I can make at home. Make is spectacular or stop making it. Not enough meat on the bun and just boring taste overall.   The 2 sauces are a bit boring too. The Tangy Sauce has way too much going on and the Vinegar based sauce is just a mess of flavors and such. I will commend them on just doing 2 sauces. Most bad BBQ places will have 3 or 4 sauces to try to cover up for them not knowing anything about BBQ. Would have loved a Mustard/Tomatoe Sauce but...meh.  The ice maker/drink station is right in the middle of the seated area and is noisy. It's distracting.   The service was OK but clearly this place is another BBQ joint being run by a few people who entered BBQ contest, won, and then someone told them to open a joint and this is the result.   It's just not working.   They have no idea how to run a restaurant and hope the big smoker thing and a decorated interior is going to make for a good place to eat, when in fact it's not. The price was not bad but $23 for lunch for 2 people and nothing crazy it is a bit much for 2 people. Don't feel like it was anything special.  Overall this was a huge disappointment. I won't be going there again.",

    "text": "Update: Ate here a few weeks ago and it was awesome!  I've eaten here four times, and 3 of those visits were great. Tonight, however, my experience was less than desirable. My dinner date and I chose to eat outside. First off, our waitress rarely came out and checked on us. She even told us she always forgets about her tables on the patio. Next, upon being seated at the patio we noticed there was an empty picnic table full of dirty dishes. When we left about an hour later, that table still hadn't been cleaned off. It was kind of gross to have to look at. Additionally, and perhaps the worst thing, was the food. I ordered the wing tray and my wings were dry as the Sahara, almost like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp. I've ordered them several times before, and they had always been good up until today. One of my hush puppies was so hard I literally thought I'd break a tooth on it. Overall, tonight's food was just unsatisfying. I feel like I wasted my money. I really hope they get it together, because usually this place is great, but tonight everything was disappointing.",

Mike the owner came out to chat with us about the food...very nice guy clearly interested in our feedback. The hush puppies were great. The chopped pork was very good with a nice texture and flavor. The ribs were excellent - tender and moist with a nice crust from the slightly sweet caramelized sauce. Red slaw and white slaw each had distinct flavors. Fries were serviceable. My table mates said the beans were ok but really just beans. They offered a vinegar sauce and a sweet/mildly spicy sauce. The two combined was a nice heat/tang combo. Will definitely be back next time we are in the area.",

She brought our drinks out right away. We each ordered a combo plate. I had the BBQ chicken and ribs and hubby had the sausage and grilled pork chop. It came with beans, hush pups, fries and your choice of red or white slaw or potato salad. So, hindsight, too much food! LoL The fries were beautiful crinkle cut and cooked to perfection! The beans were great but a tad but sweet for me so I added some Frank's Red Hit and that did the trick! Hush pups were amazing too! I usually do not eat them! I loved the white slaw! Yumm! My ribs were cooked as if They were for a judge on GrillMasters!  Amazing! Had a nice smokey flavor, sweet and spicy sauce and just the right \"pull\" off the bones. I normally do not like chicken breast but the grilled breast was out of this world! Of course I had to try hubby's fare as well. His grilled pork chop had the best flavor! I put sauce on it - mixed the house sauce (saw that in another review) and it was wonderful! The sausage was DELISH as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the red slaw. My hubby liked it a lot. Just not my cup o tea. Christina kept our drinks filled and gave us a to go cup when we left. She was very pleasant and attentive! Thank you Christina! This is one of the BEST BBQ joints we've ever been to - I'm pretty sure it's my new fav. I only wish we lived a little closer! Keep up the fabulous work!!!",

We waited 35 minutes after our order was taken to get our food. We were only two adults and two small children. It was a rainy Thursday night and the place was not packed. When our food was finally delivered, the portions were extremely skimpy. My barbecue sandwich was on the cold side but after having waited 35 minutes I wasn't about to send it back.  We ordered one regular size barbecue sandwich that came with fries, one kids meal corn dog that came with fries, one kids barbecue plate that came with one side and one Philly cheesesteak. The only drinks were iced tea and lemonade. I was very surprised when the bill came. They added a $2 up charge to replace the french fries on the kids barbecue plate with mac & cheese and apparently the cheesesteak sandwich didn't come with anything because they charged an additional $3 for a few fries.  That seems really petty!The quality and quantity of food seems to have gone steadily downhill here.  The 35 minute wait was not worth the five minutes it took us to eat.",

Their sides are really good as well - the green beans are THE BEST I've had anywhere. Super amazing. What I really love is when you dine in, you are soon greeted by warm hush puppies - awesome. The staff is always super sweet and courteous. Very good people. The ambiance has a local pub feel. Cozy but not as cozy as a Jim & Nick's.   What would I change? Not much. I would love to see them have mashed potatoes and gravy with biscuits, but that's just a selfish ask. The beef brisket is pretty much the only thing I've tasted that I don't really like. Fort Mill BBQ wears the crown on that one (but that's the only thing that would make me go there - and it's kinda expensive there).  Overall really great value - great food, great service, great price. I've committed to myself to eat their special listed on the tables - the meal for two...but on my birthday...just for me ;).",

Based on my experience from other places that smoke their meats, I expected the ribs to be moist, tender, and lean.  That was not my experience and it was disappointing especially since it had lots of good Yelp reviews.  The fries a crinkled cut which is my favorite but these were so salty I could not enjoy them even after removing a lot of the salt.  I tried the cole slaw and it was the most disgusting thing I've tasted in a long time.  It ruined my taste buds and upset my stomach so I refrigerated the remaining ribs.  I returned to 521 BBQ Grill for more sauce.  I re-heated the ribs in the oven and added more sauce, they were better the next day.  The sauce was good, so I will probably return to purchase a bottle but nothing else.",

I didn't even need salt, so that was a pleasant surprise!  The BBQ itself had a great flavor. They offered a tomato based (sweet) and a vinegar based (spicy) sauce, conveniently placed on the tables. I prefer both, so I mixed them together and they go very well, if that's your thing, too.  I even added a little Frank's that they also had out there because some like it hot and whatevs.  The beer was good and cold, the service was great (Haley and another awesome lady whose name I didn't catch were the only ones there and they still took time to interact with customers without keeping people waiting) and the restroom was clean.

The only thing is we got the ribs and they were supposed to be baby back ribs and they were more like spare ribs.  They were still very good.  But not a baby back cut.  Sauce was excellent.  Beef brisket was excellent.  Hush puppies collards Mac and cheese very good.  Red slaw way to hot and spicy.  Not red enough.  Beans were rather mediocre.  All in all we will go back.  I'd have ribs again.  Mac and cheese, collards puppies and BBQ.",

I mix the 2 sauces for a sweet & spicy taste.  It's really good with the pulled pork or to dip the fries in.  The kids menu is pretty pricey & it don't include their drink. The drink is an additional $2 charge. This is way I gave it only 4 Stars.  All in all, I strongly recommend this place.",

We also got jalepeno poppers for an appetizer,  those were good. When we got our food I thought they may have gotten my order mixed up as the brisket looked like chopped pork. It was moist but no flavor at all. I was expecting more since they advertised all over that they smoke their meats for a long time. I added some of their sauces. The BBQ sauce was sweet and the vinegar based one was spicy but not flavorful. My greens were good, those had a little kick but I added salt. I didnt finish the standard crinkle cut fries. My boyfriends cheese fries were topped with a gross, canned cheese. The mac and cheese was ok but definitely didnt seem homemade. It tasted just like a Stouffers frozen mac n cheese. I expected more from theirs place and was very disappointed to spend $50 for our meals. Not worth it.",

Something has changed in the past year.  The food has gone down hill very fast.  There has been a lot of turnover in the servers as well.  That should tell you something.  Last week, my family went and I ordered the ribs.  They were different than they usually are. The meat was twisted and falling off and they were SMOTHERED in barbque sauce.  I even thought maybe they were trying to hide something.  Later that night, I got the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had.  I even had to go to the ER.  The doctor ran tests and diagnosed me with food poisoning.    Do yourself a favor and do not eat at this place.  As I was going through the reviews I saw another person mentioned their son getting sick from the coleslaw.  I will never eat at any of the 521's again.",

When they finally acknowledge me, I explained I was there to pickup takeout I ordered on Yelp. They say we're not on Yelp. I say, yes, you are, their reply, you don't know what you're talking about.   I then prove to them they are on Yelp, and that they have takeout ordering on Yelp. 10 minutes later, after thinking I work for Grubhub, and was there to pickup an order for delivery, when I kept telling them I was there to pickup my own takeout order, and showed them it was placed, and I was charged for, they finally understood, and said we don't take yelp orders.   So 25 minutes to figure out they didn't have my order, and can't change the channel on their TV like a normal person. Pass.",

First original opened and owner(Mike) managed that location. 2nd location is this one. Managed by his son. How do I know this. Met him at a cigar shop in Rock Hill. He mentioned to stop by so here I am..  Went today against my diet restriction.. I'm happy I did but I'll pay for it later. I ordered the ribs tray. 6 baby back ribs with white coleslaw, hush puppies, baked beans and Mac n cheese.. as much as I want to love the white coleslaw, it's not for me. Even tho it has a more creamy consistency, it just too peppery.. I couldn't finish it. Now the good part.. their ribs was juicy, fall of the bones, meaty and the sauce was just perfect. Sauce has a sweet yet gave you a little spicy kick. Just a little. I enjoyed it.. the hushpuppies. Oh yummy. I started putting leftover rib sauce on it. Even better. Mac n cheese was good. Not excellent but goes well with the BBQ.  Our waiter was sweet. Almost walked out with their cup in hand and not even paid yet.. too busy talking. She didn't make a scene or fuss at us... A beautiful lady with great personality!   Oh I gave the cup back and PAID.   Check out their weekly specials.. look cool. I'll be back..",

I sat at the bar and took the advice to try the center cut ribs.   Let me tell you, I LOVE ribs, and these ribs are way up there on my best rib list. Easily some of the most tender, juice, and meaty. The only issue they didn't have the smoke flavor I was looking for. The BBQ sauce was tangy and had a little heat, but I found it was a little too much vinegar. I also wish they put the ribs on the grill to give them a nice char. The hush puppies are large, and moist, but a little too much onion flavor for my liking. Still a very good hush puppy.   The service is by far the shining star, everyone was so amazingly friendly. Service was quick, and I love they provided a rib bowl for the bones, must say that is a first at a restaurant kind of nice touch. They also had wet wipes and provided them with out being asked for them.   Great place to eat, the ribs are worth it!",

The ribs were meaty and not overcooked. The ribs had some chew, as in you had to pull some of the meat off the bone as compared to a sloppy mess. The downfall to them was the fact that they weren't warm, and the sauce they slathered it with was high on the sugar content.

I ordered the combo plate with ribs brisket and fries with slaw. The ribs were fantastic as always, the sides weren't fabulous but passable, the brisket was watery with very little smoke which was a little disappointing. The pricing was decent and the others in my group seemed to enjoy their meal. Not a bad experience overall though I'll probably skip the brisket next time.",

What was slightly off putting was the older gentleman who greeted and seated me upon arrival who proceeded to add table numbers during my meal.  Not a huge deal, but having someone kneeling down about 9 inches from you food doing something with the table without saying a word--was just weird.  I had the brisket sandwich and fried okra, both of which were tasty and would be reordered.  I encourage anyone to try the Brisket with the eastern Carolina sauce provided at the table.  Drink tea or another drink that isn't from the fountain dispenser--as there is a very noticeable plastic taste.  My final comment would be to allow ample time at lunch as my plate took a little more than 30 minutes to reach the table after ordering.  Overall, I'll be back.",

Igor a small plate because I wasn't very hungry and it was the perfect amount. I had the pulled pork with baked beans. They had different kinds of BBQ sauce on the table, so it was nice to have choices. The baked beans had a little BBQ Smokey taste and the pulled pork was very tender.

Salad had brown pieces and the chicken was cold! Obviously they precook it and warm it in the microwave or on the grill. Cut one peice off the chicken and bit into a cold rubbery tendon. Absolutely disgusting! Told the waitress I couldnt eat it bc it was cold and chewy. Do NOT go eat here! Absolutely trash chicken for a place that claims it serves bbq. Also I paid 9 bucks for a half eaten side salad and small serving of collard greens. Most disappointing 9 bucks I've ever spent!",

Now, This location is about 3 miles away. Not saying I wouldn't visit anyway. To be completely honest, I'm not sure I've tried anything but their pulled pork. It's just too good for me to crave anything else. The meat is tender, it's not dry or greasy, and whatever they rub it with or douse it in when they cook, it doesn't have too strong of a flavor so you can sauce it up your way. The sweet sauce is a perfect ketchup based sauce. Drizzled lightly or swamping your protein, it's like having dessert for dinner.  The hushpuppies are another very stand alone topic. You can tell they are fresh just by the strange shape. Somewhat like a chicken finger but a little shorter and a lot meatier. They are light, fluffy and a whole lot of delicious. Typically, I try to steer away from anything fried in oil, with the exception of fries, but it's so hard not to crave a fresh basket of hushpuppies with BBQ.  Always a great place for a quick meal.",

Their popularity flourished due to their excellent food and service. They moved down and across the street to a much larger place that even had outdoor seating. The variety on their menu is second to none... it's not JUST barbecue! My favorite is the barbecue babyback ribs plate with 3 sides. I love the fried okra, hush puppies and collard greens the best. I sometimes get my order to go, then sit at the bar for a glass of wine (or two!). I now go to the on in Tega Cay, closer to where I live. The staff is great, the place is always busy and the food can't be beat! Keep it coming, 521!!!!!",

They don't short you in the amount of food they give you either and for a pretty good price! I think it's smart (if you don't eat a lot) to get the two meat plate or tray [depending on the number of sides you want] and it will end up being two meals. That's what I did, as you see pictured, I doubled up on the chopped pork. The second half was taken to work for lunch the next day.  Though I didn't care for the green beans, the overall plate was tasty! The QuietDogs, as a complimentary muncher, were a nice fried treat! QuietDogs, you ask? Yeah ... HushPuppies! You're welcome. :)  Check for the Daily Specials too! Wednesday was $3 craft beer night. Nice! They offer a different special everyday, well except for Monday - they are CLOSED!  They ain't wingin' it here: I do have to say they have the BEST (non breaded) wings I have ever eaten in the Charlotte area! I ate one off a friends plate.. WOW! I should've ordered the wings.

I had the fried okra and a separate order of fries and both were adequate. The beef brisket was not good at all. It was basically \"gray\" and looked more boiled than smoked. I enjoy good barbecue and this was not good barbecue.  Now since my order was to go, the fact that  it was in a styrofoam clam shell container may have created a \"steaming\" effect on the  brisket, but I wouldn't expect that to result in no smoked flavor? On top of that my order contained only 3 sclices of brisket and a large piece of fat!  Not a good experience overall. I may try them again in the future but not any time soon. Disappointing...",

Most of the time the service is great but there have been occasions where I felt like I wasn't valued as a customer or felt rushed during my meal.  The take out experience is always accurate.",

Our server was nice and the service good .We've read and heard good things about this place and have been wanting to try it.  We both had the pulled pork platter. It was a little disappointing, perhaps because we expected too much. The large sized serving of meat only had a mild BBQ flavor. However, we all liked the sauces which blended well with the meat.  Our sides were the white cole slaw, red cole slaw and fried okra The cole slaw was served in a container so small that I think it would be more appropriate for a condiment rater then a side item. The slaw was gray and tasted old/bad. Despite this, my son ate the whole side (3 bites) and later got sick. We wonder if there was a connection. The red slaw was very different, with a nice not-to vinegary taste. (I'd give this place 4 stars if it weren't for the small, gray cole slaw). I enjoyed the okra as it was hot and not greasy. The hush puppies were wonderful, probably the best we've ever had and we could make of just there. They were hot, not greasy, not dry and actually had a nice corn flavor.",

Love the ribs, wings, smoked sausage, BBQ Burger(available on Mondays), and Brisket(available on Thursdays). The owners and staff are always friendly and make an effort to get to know you.  Give 521 Tega Cay a shot and you'll be a regular before you know it!  Enjoy.",

    "text": "All I can say is \"Wow!  Ribs are SUPPOSED to have meat on them!\"  Let me explain that.  I have tried ribs at other BBQ joints before, and every time I did I wound up getting one bite, maybe two, and leaving the rest rather disappointed.  So when I saw the combo at 521 I thought, \"What the heck.  Let's try ONE MORE TIME and see if this place is any different.\"  The ribs looked like THICK pork chops!  I made a meal off two of the ribs alone!  They were so tasty, and by the time I was finished with just HALF of them, I had to take the rest of the combo plate home with me!  We've never gone into this place where the staff wasn't just the most courteous and friendly people you could meet, and I'm digging the vinegar-based sauce; a good \"Eastern Carolina\" sauce is always a plus for me.  And my very picky son could eat the hush puppies all by themselves, though he does like a little BBQ thrown in for good measure!  Can't go wrong with this place!",

The problem is you can get  better choices elsewhere for a lot less money. :(",

Nice outside seating, busy servers, and a good menu, where adults can thankfully order off the kid's menu. Ordered kid - sized rib plate, which consisted of 4 meaty,  well sauced and nicely charred ribs, smoked over hardwood pellets over a gas flame for 12 hours. They were tasty, although I really felt like there was not enough smokiness for my taste. Best hush puppies I have had out of the 3 bbq joints in NC we have visited thus far. Crispy on the outside without any trace of grease, and a perfect balance of moist and flaky inside. The beans were underwhelming,  tasted saucy, as my daughter assesed \"they would be good on a hot dog.\" They had a unique red coleslaw, which our waitress explained was made with a ketchup vinegar base, which wasn't bad, but not anything I would go out of the way to have again. But oh, those hush puppies...they just might!",
