Next, our waiter, Tyler, was awesome. He took great care of us, ensuring that our every need was met.  His patience was really appreciated as there were so many fantastic options on the menu that we had trouble deciding.  Adrienne, the manager, stopped by to make sure that everything was going well and helped us to decide.  The food, and we ordered a lot of it, was amazing.  There's everything to love here.  We will definitely be coming back!",

Measly boring couple of salad leaves and not much else. Worse, the chicken breast I did get was puny, like a young child's portion tiny. My colleague's ordered the same thing but got obviously more chicken, like almost double (still, like a 10 year old's portion). Also the lunch menu is limited unless you like carbs a lot (pasta, pizza, sandwiches). Barely a few salads with no listed protein (had to ask for chicken).  Service was not great either. Waiter acted like my work colleague was out of line asking for bread at lunch. Won't be coming back. Cool decor though.",

    "text": "First time visit.    We made reservations and arrived 10 mins ahead.  We were escorted to a crowded small area of two top tables.  We requested a booth but we're told none were available....yet 3 were open and set.  We asked if specific tables were reserved at this establishment and the answer was of course no.  Reluctantly, we sat at the table just feet away from the kitchen.  Some 45 mins nearing the end of our meal we noticed that the third of of the 3rd of the open booths was being sat.  We again asked about this and the waiter could not or would not respond.  The only difference we could see.....we are an interracial couple...the booths were all occupied by white couples.  Now to the food.  Great tasting.  That said, being sat near the kitchen does have it advantages or disadvantages if you are someone that might be bothered by unsanitary behavior by the prepping and serving staff.  Not once but 3 times the lead food runner put his clearly unclean hands on the food he was about to serve.  The last time he had dropped his writing pen on the floor only to pick it up then reach over and pick up a bun and place on the plate and then he promptly served it to an unaware guest.  Make your own call on this one.",

The bread came with a olive spread that started us out on a great high note. We had Fried Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer. I know many don't like Brussels Sprouts but we do and these had a super tasty balsamic vinegar dressing on it. Hubby had 1/2 chicken, I had the pappardelle bolognese, both dishes were some of the finest we've ever had. We finished with the Chocolate Ganache cake. Our bellies were very  satisfied as we waddled out of there.",

I was attending a show last night so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to try it. There were 4 of us and we decided to order several items to share for the table. First we had the whipped ricotta and crispy bread. It was delicious. Next, we had the calamari. Not only was it soggy, but there were lots of broken pieces and some random pieces of fried vegetables. Very small amount of calamari and it had no flavor. Next came the pizza which was good. Finally, we had a pasta dish made with ribbon noodles in some sort of a \"brownish\" sauce. This was the biggest disappointment! The pasta was soggy and over cooked and for 20 something dollars, it was barely an appetizer sized potion. At that point, we decided to get dessert elsewhere. With all the restaurant choices, this place really needs to \"step it up\"",

I called to see if there was an error since $42 (pats plus scallops) was more than the seafood entrees that include scallops as well as other seafood.

    "text": "This review is for Friends and Family Brunch Weekend 1/28/18.  I had the opportunity to try out their newly developed brunch menu. After brunch we provided feedback for quality of food and service. I would go back to try the carbonara and would love to try the craft cocktails.  The brunch menu is lengthy. It was hard to decide. For my brunch visit, I had the following dishes:  Avocado Toast-Avocado Toast Avocado Mousse, Ciabatta, Fried Prosciutto, Calabrian Aioli- ciabatta, sturdy enough to hold the mousse. avocado mousse, smooth as a mousse should be but I'd prefer a bit more texture in this case. I'm the first to preach about the importance of lime juice or lemon juice to cut the fat of an avocado but in this case, there was a bit too much. fried prosciutto was crispy, a welcomed contrast to the smooth texture of the mousse and aioli. calabrian  ( pepper) aioli- mild, more mayonnaise flavor. My wish was for my spice in the aioli.   Banana Bread French Toast Whipped Sorghum Butter, Compressed Strawberries, Candied Pecans-I wanted more flavor. I will compare the taste to a banana muffin. I longed for crispy edges that I love  from a perfectly cooked piece of French toast.   House Selections of Salumi & Cheeses, House Giardiniera, Fig Jam, Breads- the cheese selection varies by chef's choice. The jam was delicious!  Whipped Ricotta  Sourdough, Lavender Honey, Pistachio-one of my faves. An impressive balance of flavor. The lavender wasn't as present as I would've liked.  *Hash16 Braised Oxtail, Caramelized Onions, Bell Peppers, Taleggio Fonduta, Rosemary Potatoes, Sunny Up Eggs-another fave. I shared this dish with one of my tablemates. The kitchen staff kindly separated the dish into two bowls for us. More oxtail, less potatoes. The egg was cooked nicely.  Chocolate Cake 9 Smoked Sea Salt Ganache, Fernet Cherry-I love chocolate! On a different day, I may have eaten more of this dessert but today, it was too rich for me. The cherry served as a garnish and didn't add anything to the dish. This is a shareable dessert.",

For size reference, it's the size of a quarter and as thick an almond. The female manager seemed less than concerned and said, \"Oh, we'll take the burger off your bill.\" Of course you will because I would not have paid for it. Fortunately, I was eating the burger and not one of my children who could have DIED if it had became logged in their throat. A health inspection needs to be done to see what is going on in their meat grinding process. It is NOT up to code.",

When we got to the restaurant neither of these items were on the menu-we were told by the waiter that \"sorry we really need to update the menu online\".  The chicken parmesan dish has been replaced by another chicken dish-which unfortunately we decided to give a try.  It was TERRIBLE.  The chicken was so dry none of us on the table could finish it-it had absolutely NO flavor either.  This dinner was a birthday dinner for two of the 4 in the party-what a disappointment!  WE will never be back.   This is the first time I have posted a review on YELP-but I was so disappointed by our experience I do not want others to have the Birthday dinner fail we did.",

As of 8:00 am on Friday morning, I never received a confirmation call. I followed up myself the previous Thursday night and the hostess was of no help. I called on my own again Friday morning at 7:30. The hostess said she could make my reservation for me (weird how the rules just changed) but I needed to push my time back.

The soup special was delicious and we were excited for what was to follow. We revived a salty bread with olive tapenade and then got our carbonara pizza that was beyond salty. Don't get me wrong I love salt but this was so overly salty and oily we had to wipe off the cheese and take off all the ingredients. As for the lamb pasta which we thought would change our perspective of the salty food, we were dead wrong. It tasted like Prego sauce and the lamb was not to be found. I was so disappointed and decided to not write a bad review until I got so sick that night and the following day. My boyfriend has had the worst gas and I the worst stomach pains. We woke up with a bloated face and fingers from the sodium. Maybe we had a bad batch but for the one special date night we had in Charlotte this was such a let down.",

They do NOT offer valet parking but there is a parking deck across the street and they validate parking. The drinks are as described and not bad, the interior decor is nice as well... The food was disappointing to say the least... pretty sure I'll be sick tomorrow from the mussels. I had the squid ink pasta with mussels, scallops and what seemed like bacon chunks? It was horrible, some mussels were undercooked and some were extremely dry and overcooked (not sure how that happens). My wife ordered the ravioli which was described as cheesy and fruity (saving you from the long False explanation we recieved) hers tasted fishy, almost like it was cooked alongside a lobster and scallops.  If we ever come back I may try the pizza, but save yourself the loss of money and head straight upstairs to Merchant and Trade, they have food that looks way better and the views are amazing. The drinks are way better also upstairs.",

All great tasting and portions are actually just right. Good light music in the background makes this a great place for conversations and cool dining experience.

The have an entrance through the hotel and they also have their own entrance(which they weren't using at this time due to it being a really cold night). Upon entering, the ambiance and decor is really good. The place looks great so kudos in that area.   They were fairly busy when we went, but were able to be seated quickly which was nice. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave a few recommendations. We ordered a Bellini, Pork Shank and the Ox Tail pasta. Unfortunately, both of these dishes were pretty flavorless. Not only were they bland, but the portion sizes were tiny. I do not typically mind smaller portion sizes as long as those bites are really well done, but that just was not the case here. The total was around $80, which is also fine for a fine dining establishment, but this felt like a complete waste of money. Maybe it was just an off night, but currently I could only suggest visiting here for the ambiance and maybe to grab a few drinks.",

I hate to say it, the food is not that good! I ordered the BRAISED OXTAIL LUMACONI, while I love oxtail, this dish was a big miss. For starters, the entire dish was cold, yes cold, the oaxtail itself was at normal temperature, the pasta was either cold or slightly warm, super strange. The portions are small, and I get it when you have higher-end restaurants providing high quality items, that is not the entire complaint here. My wine which was the red zin, which was also cold... as if it was refrigerated. We made mention of all of this to the manager when he came and asked how we were doing, and he was very apologetic and offered to pay for our meal the next time we returned.

    "text": "Came in from out of town on a rainy Sunday night and felt at home immediately.  The staff was warm, attentive and made great recommendations.  I had the whipped ricotta appetizer which is this wonderful salty sweet concoction that is great on the crusty bread or straight.  For my main I had the Braised Lamb Sugo Rigati.  It was good but I found myself wanting more lamb flavor throughout the dish.  I noshed on the delightful focaccia and olive tapenade so I didn't have room for desert but will save room for next time as they all looked wonderful.  I will be back!",

Our server was very knowledgeable & attentive. We had the Whipped Ricotta as an appetizer. It was flavorful &  light without being filling. I had the Bistecca which is the 21 day aged ribeye. It was well seasoned & very tender.  The ambience was very upscale & modern. However, a little too noisy to be deemed romantic. I would definitely characterize this as a special occasion restaurant or one to take friends!",

We didn't sit outside, but if you're going, id recommend sitting outside and getting just drinks and appetizers.",

    "text": "Visiting Charlotte from NYC and decided to check  out Angeline's with my sister. We had dinner reservations at 8:45 last night (Saturday) and once we entered we were greeted politely by the hostess however our table wasn't ready so we went to grab a drink at the bar.   Bar  After waiting 5 mins to be acknowledged by the bartender (the bar was full but not overly busy, just people waiting for their reserved tables) I asked the bartender about their cocktails and what he would recommend, he had NO opinion and said the menu was new. I was slightly taken back that the bartender had no opinion nor suggestion on any bar drinks on their menu. I am paying New York and LA prices for a drink and you aren't selling it to me. ($16 for a drink) Luckily I ordered something based on my preference of alcohol and it ended up being great. The experience at the bar was very disappointing, hopefully they will staff another bartender on Friday and Saturday nights as the two there seemed to be very overwhelmed, which reflected their ability to provide great customer service.   We were sat around 9:15 -- The restaurant was barely 2/3 of the way full and waited 30mins to be seated after our reservation time.   Dinner Our dinner was good, the food came out very quickly we ordered the Bolognese and the Chop Salad. I would suggest both! My sister wasn't overly impressed by dinner but I thought it was good. The service at the table was great, he was very friendly however the waiter didn't greet our table for 4 minutes, which in this situation is a very long time. We ordered Bar drinks right away and received  them a few minutes before our food arrived, again the bar was struggling to get drinks out.   More than likely I will never visit Angeline's again, the customer service is lacking and the food isn't making up for it. This restaurant has a lot of potential however they need to work out the kinks..",

I decided on the oxtail pasta, because why not? Y'all I was so excited for this pasta! Oxtails + carbs is a guaranteed winner. Right?! Nope. I'm really sensitive to salt and this meal was so bland. NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER. My taste buds were so confused.  If I come back to this place, it will be for drinks only.",

We have birthdays within 4 days of each other so we always try a new restaurant to celebrate both our birthdays, this year - we chose Angeline's because neither of us had ever been. I honestly can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We got a drink at the bar while we were waiting on our table to be cleaned and the bartender was so nice and tentative. When our table was ready, very quickly might I add, we were escorted by the kindest hostess I've ever dealt with, and she handed me a rose and a handwritten happy birthday card. When I handed the card to my fiance, she realized it was also his birthday and then came back with another hand written card for him. The service was outstanding. We ordered the calamari appetizer and both ordered chicken Parmesan for dinner. (Boring, I know) But quite honestly, it was the best chicken Parmesan I've ever had. And my fiance is Italian! We were truly impressed. We then ordered the chocolate cake dessert to share, but the wait staff brought out TWO desserts (one strawberry cheesecake and also the chocolate cake we ordered) with happy birthday written on them and a candle in each. It was truly a wonderful experience!",

A group of four, highly motivated, young guys looking for drinks and things.... and we were seated at a table of our choice within 5 minutes.  The outside patio area is fantastic.  They added a wood grain detail to the poured concrete retaining wall that blocks the city bustle from the dining experience.  Music plays from green outdoor speakers which kind of look like giant ant bait traps, but the sound quality and selection are perfect.  We were able to talk and enjoy the music without yelling over it.    The food was so tasty.  I had a salad and some pasta, and both were a tad on the small side, but highly flavorful.  I asked the hostess about my salad not having blue cheese crumbles on it as advertised, and she quickly made it right. I wasn't looking for a redo or a refund, but she made sure I left happy.  The pasta was SOOO GOOOD!!! I could have eaten three of the dishes full of  the al dente tagliatelle!!   Oh, how can I forget the drink?!  I had what was in essence a margarita, but a variation that was even better.  I believe it was called Cold Storage, YUM!!    The service was prompt and continuous.  Floors and tables were kept very clean, and the decorations were extremely tasteful and modern.  It was a great experience and I will certainly be back!!  Oh, the hostess gave me a flower when I was leaving because she said I made her night.  How sweet?!",

    "text": "Rarely do I book a table at a restaurant without checking the Yelp reviews, but this time, I'm happy I didn't. I dined at Angeline's on the night of my 21st birthday about a week ago. I can only attribute the low star ratings to growing pains, as the restaurant is fairly new. I can attest that they have worked out the kinks.  First off, I booked a reservation for 2 on OpenTable and noted that I was celebrating a birthday. We arrived and were greeted by the hosts, who were very sweet. When we sat down, there was a handwritten note on the table that said thank you for choosing us on our special day. Nice, but not enough to warrant a 5-star review. What really made our night was our server, Taylor. The service was flawless - she was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. I was downright impressed, as I used to wait tables, and I know she's got this down to a science. Let me also note that the restaurant is gorgeous inside and the ambiance is lovely, not too quiet nor loud.  Now that I've bored you with the details, let's discuss food. WOW. Just wow. We started with calamari and risotto. Both blew me away. The calamari was fresh, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. The fried lemon served in the dish was a bold move that was executed well. The risotto was some of the best I've ever had, albeit untraditional. My boyfriend and I were having trouble deciding between two pasta dishes, so our server suggested we get half-portions of both for the same price as one full dish. We were sold and each got half-portions (if you're thinking \"why didn't you each get one of the dishes?\" it's because we don't like to share.) Moving on, the pasta was great, and obviously freshly made. We shared a bottle of Italian Moscato; a bit pricey but worth every penny.   I would absolutely recommend a dinner at Angeline's, despite the low reviews from earlier. My experience was nothing but positive. Lovely atmosphere, drink selection, and menu. Absolutely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Came in after 10pm on a Friday night. My SO and I had just checked in to the Kimpton hotel and wanted to grab a bite to eat without going too far from the hotel. The hotel staff members directed us where to enter. When we walked in, it wasn't clear to us where we were supposed to go. It looked like a nice enough restaurant where you wait to be seated, so we decided to stand near the other entrance.  After standing there, confused for a few minutes, a friendly face finally greeted us. We told the hostess we heard from the hotel that they close at 11 and asked if they still have full service. She informed us that they only serve pizza between 10pm-11pm. We were fine with that then we asked to sit at the bar.  The restaurant staff quickly cleaned off and prepared our section. The three bartenders (2 males and 1 female) took very good care of us. They were very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. My SO asked for a drink with whiskey, something similar to an old fashioned. The bartender suggested a boulevardier ($11+), composed of whiskey, vermouth, and campari. My SO decided to try that. I ordered the rossini ($11), which is prosecco with strawberry. The SO really enjoyed his cocktail, so much so that he tried to order it again at another bar. My rossini was refreshing as expected.  I ordered the carbonara pizza ($16) and the SO the confit potato ($16). Both pizzas came out as described. However, both were too salty for my liking. I love pizza and usually don't mind the saltiness of it, but this was almost overwhelming. Even the egg on my pizza was too salty! It was late and I was hungry after traveling, so I slowly but surely worked my way to finishing my personal pizza. The salt level didn't seem to bother my SO. He actually enjoyed his pizza.   The place is new, just opened on November 1st. It's clean and beautifully and carefully decorated. I am curious enough to come back and try other items on their menu. I do not think I will be ordering any of their pizzas again.",

    "text": "THE RESTAURANT: New age Italian style restaurant attached to the Kimpton Tyron Park Hotel (don't be like me and wander outside for 10 minutes). The restaurant has dark, pleasant ambiance with an open kitchen concept and a full stacked bar. Layout is friendly for groups up to 6 with a larger room in the back. Adequate selection of wine but slightly limited for orders by glass. Menu is relatively. The staff could be a little more attentive in terms of checking up on tables (7:30 on a Monday was @ ~60% capacity).   THE FOOD: Wine was delicious, bread was delicious. Ordered the Porchetta which came in a pool of Polenta and oil. First and second bites were delicious, but from there on our it became nauseatingly heavy and oily. The pasta looked great though so would probably try that next time.  THE STAFF/SERVICE Interactions with the staff can be quite different, table next to mine was high energy, engaging, and in depth with explanations of the menu, bar, and restaurant where mine was a bit more hands off (I did eat by myself).  Though my waitress never asked how the meal was, offered to switch out my entree after I brought up the heaviness of the meal. After declining twice, she comped the entree with no hesitation. Finishing off the glass of Malbec now, which is doing a surprisingly good job of balancing out the pork belly.",

The menu was very small which would be ok if the offered dishes would have been fresh and delicious. But that was not the case. The catch of the day was totally bland. The side, wild brokkoli, was cold and hard. Also the seafood pasta was tasteless and overcooked. The seafood in the pasta were two scallops and some clams, that's it. The food was totally overpriced, the plates were small and carelessly done.  We didn't complain because the young waiter did a good job and we didn't want him to feel uncomfortable. The service people who brought the check disappeared abruptly without asking if everything was ok. Sorry, but this was one of the worst restaurant experiences since we have been living here.",

My husband and I decided to go to a bunch of our favorite spots and a new one for dinner. Angeline's was that spot. It was perfectly lit (lighting makes it or breaks it for me), warm and welcoming and a nice manageable size.  Our waiter was on it and timed things just right. I have to say, I didn't really explore the menu since I saw cacio e pepe pasta right away. I looked no further! That's what I wanted. The waiter did put a disclaimer out to let me know that all it was was pasta without any meat or vegetables. I already knew that because of what I had ordered but apparently others who have ordered didn't know what they were getting. My guy got bolognese. Everything was really great. It's a good date spot but there was a larger family next to me and a large group of friends was also there.  Tip: If you are here around Christmas time you can walk around the corner and go to the Christmas market too.",

First, we were seated next to the door - most certainly the most unromantic table available as the bar was busy and there were many people standing around us. Then the server talked down to us, saying, 'Let's go over the words you don't know.' WHAT?  The food was less than mediocre. My husband's dish was something you could get anywhere. My pappardelle bolognese was way overseasoned with nutmeg or cinnamon. It was the only flavor I could taste. We went 10 minutes with empty wine glasses. I think this is in opposition to one of the ten commandments, no?  The check was dropped without asking if we wanted dessert and it was my birthday! This is where I lost it on the server a little bit.  And, lastly, I am not saying that this is a food-borne illness thing, but after about 4 hours of eating that terrible bolognese, it all came back up. I got so sick for about 12 hours. And it wasn't the alcohol as I only had 1.5 glasses of wine.  Never again, Angeline's!  And PS - What a terrible place for a hostess stand. It needs to be moved!",

The atmosphere is warm and they really paid attention to all of the details on the design.   Wine list is great, containing wines from all over the world and at all price points. Had a delicious Barbera, as well as some great cocktails!   Food was excellent, my favorites were the fried calamari, braised oxtail lumaconi and the brussel sprouts. The homemade pasta and sauce was incredible. Very rich dish so perfect for sharing! Ended the meal with the zeppoli, which are little Italian doughnuts. They were phenomenal and I especially loved the buttermilk ice cream they were served with. We also tried the carbonara pizza and the Queen's Chop Salad.   Casey was an excellent server. Took great care of us and was very friendly. The manager came over a couple of times as well and we enjoyed chatting with her.   Can't wait to go back for dinner again as well as try their brunch!",

The bartender was confused and said they could not make it without egg whites. ...... she eventually realized how absurd that sounded and then she served it in a tiny glass to get back at me..........what??!!! Really??!! I can't stop laughing......How are all these people at the bar so overweight?????? The appetizer portions are microscopic!!!!  We had one cocktail, one beer, one TINY chopped salad and the mussels. Bill was $45. What?!!!!??? I'm going to stop at Wendy's on my way home.

We did have the kale lasagna dish (forgetting the name here) but it was fabulous! the chef even had it split for us to make things easier. Drinks were also great..

We had:  - Polpette: pork and lamb meatballs that we were basically fighting for who will get the last piece.  They were that good.   - Whipped Ricotta: a classic. There's lavender honey that gives the ricotta a subtle sweetness. You may find yourself taking your last bread and scraping as much off the plate as possible. Haha - Tettrazini: this was a hit. Take one bite and you can instantly taste how fresh the pasta is (and I'm all about some homemade pasta). With the shredded chicken, peas and mushrooms, this dish satisfied all my taste buds.  - Ribeye: my boyfriend got the ribeye, which isn't your plain steak and potatoes dish. It's massive! It's so big that it has it's own plate (which he was very happy about).  - Geechie Boy Polenta: this was a nice little side dish that had no chance. I found my boyfriend basically scraping every corner to make sure it was all gone. But eat it while its warm; polenta isn't that great once it gets cold.  Last but not least, the service was amazing! Dylan was our server who gave great descriptions of each dish (he's the one who sold me on the Tettrazini - thank you!) and had great conversation with us.",

The waiter caught an off the cuff remark that we would just share the glass of wine and went out of his way to bring us a second empty glass so we could split it.  It seemed everyone on the patio got the Whipped Ricotta, which lived up to expectations. If it's your first time visiting Angeline's (and you eat dairy), it's a must have. Again the waiter was fantastic and brought us extra bread when he realized we were trying to put the remaining half of the ricotta on our last piece.  We ordered the Pappardelle and Eggplant Parmesan. The Pappardelle was fantastic (possibly one of the best Italian dishes I have had without needing to leave the country). The Eggplant Parmesan was also amazing and certainly left me wanting more. Highly recommend this place!",

I really liked the focaccia with olive tapenade and the ricotta cheese!   We got a few pizzas to share and I enjoyed the truffle and our modified margherita (with mushrooms and chili peppers). It was a good amount of spice. The crust was more on the thin and crispy side, less on the bubbly and fluffy side.   Lastly, I recommend the chocolate cake for dessert!",

First, the hostess is great - she set a tone that we had high expectations ... big personality and laughs before we even started the dining journey. The actual menu was exciting - again, high hopes. I'd say the charcuterie and ricotta apps were our favorites. The meals - EH. Not good. I ordered the eggplant parm and it tasted like a \"loaf\" of baked breading. Where was the eggplant? Seriously - the eggplant and mozzarella were incognito. I couldn't finish. Others got the pasta dishes that looked tasty but were just OK. The seafood was a bit over cooked and the service was also just OK. For the pricing, I was truly hoping for more. I'd say stick with the other Italian places that will knock your socks off.....

    "text": "Oh, Angeline's.. Where to begin about my experience here!  Let's start with my first check-in. I came here and did a walkthrough of the restaurant about a month and a half ago. Debating whether or not to host my private birthday dinner here with friends. I checked out several places as I do every year and narrow it down. However this year surprisingly I decided to have a dinner at all. Though the place was beautiful I wanted to do something a little different this year... I wanted to enjoy a nice dinner SOLO! Get dressed up, hair done, makeup done and just enjoy a night out!  Making Plans I had three restaurants in mind and the night of my birthday I still couldn't decide, so I hit up my friend Nikki - Yelp Charlotte Director for help lmbo! She made a VERY great point, she said, \"I would suggest calling first to see who's available with the Belk event happening.\" She's so WISE! LOL! So I called my first place and they weren't available, then Angeline's and a nice young lady answered the phone. I asked her if they were accepting reservations or had availability for dinner that evening. I provided her my time and she said OH YES! You'll be fine! I'll put you down, will you be dining with someone... Me: Nope just me! My parents are saying they will join me because they don't want me to eat alone on my birthday so you can put possible two lol.   Arriving I parked about a block away on the street and walked to the restaurant. I noticed that Merchant and Trade had a little line. I've heard so much about the place I stopped to ask the door guy a few questions about it. Then decided in my head that I would go have a drink there after dinner. I walked into Angeline's and Jennifer greeted me, I said I was here for my 9:30 pm reservation. She said oh YES you're the Birthday Girl... Happy Birthday! I was smiling from EAR TO EAR as I thanked her. She even remembered and asked if my parents would be joining me, which I said no because I wanted to have dinner solo. She walked me to my table then raved over my handbag. We somehow started chatting as girls do than exchange Instagram handles. LOL! She really made me feel welcomed and then handed me a birthday card! What restaurant do you know gives their guest BIRTHDAY CARDS! So sweet!  Server My server came out and introduced himself, provided me with a drink menu and said he would return with some bread for me to start with. I ordered a glass of Prosecco and started with the Calamari. Yes, Champagne all night, ESPECIALLY on your birthday! He did not rush me at all, he even came over and engaged in casual conversation with me. We laughed as I shared my age, he couldn't believe it. As I was halfway through with my calamari he asked if I wanted anything else. I was debating because I didn't want anything too heavy because it was so late, and I didn't want to carry a bag upstairs to Merchant and Trade if I didn't finish it. I told him I was debating on the Queen City Salad but didn't know for sure. 10 minutes later the salad came out! I was like what! He said, Happy Birthday Lovely. How SWEET!  Food The food was so good, like REALLY good. I really enjoyed the bread and the oil spread they provided with it. I'm not sure of the correct name but it was really good. I also like the calamari, I like when calamari is served with the tinticles and rings. The Queen City salad was also delicious, tossed in the house dressing. So good!  Closing As I finished the delicious salad and was ready to pay for my meal, he brought out the check and said, I bought your glass of champagne for your birthday! Loved it! Totally unexpected but much appreciated. Celebrate every blessing big or small! I truly and thoroughly enjoyed myself and my experience at Angeline's.",

Angeline's is pretty upscale, lovely decor, but for lunch I expect to be in and out in a hour, but this place was a little slow with getting the food out, and that shouldn't happen during lunch hours.    The pappardelle was great, and was fresh pasta but I really wish it had more sauce, which was a little disappointing.  My friend had the burger which he said was fresh but not seasoned well.  I also had a side of the polenta with mushrooms......not very flavorful but not too bad.  The portion size was perfect and the service ranged from very attentive initially to having to flag down someone......again this is not what I expect during lunch.  I'll consider returning for takeout I guess.",

Our waiter was excellent and checked on us often.  The focaccia bread and olive tapenade starter was tasty. We ordered a margherita pizza as our appetizer / kids meal. Not the best pizza ever, but good. The crust is thin, which worked in our favor by not being too filling.  We both ordered the pappardelle bolognese and we LOVED it. Nice size portion and the pasta was perfectly done.  We shared the pineapple cake with lemon sorbet. Perfect palette-cleansing finisher.  We really enjoyed our dinner and will be back to try brunch!",

Located inside the new Kimpton Tryon Park Hotel (you can enter from the street or inside through the hotel), the interior is beautifully done with the shining star being the bar. Solid cocktail, beer and wine list (variety of price points per bottle which is nice depending on your budget/ what you are looking for). The whipped ricotta served with toasted sourdough is a great appetizer as well as the Queen's Chop Salad and Ribbolita soup (think beans, kale and olive oil). I have not tried the pizza, but I have seen it come out a few times and it looks delicious. The split roasted half chicken entree was great and a very generous portion. I have had the tiramisu for dessert a few times now and it is always consistent and tasty. We tried the chocolate cake last night and it was very tasty.   Great date spot for dinner, then head up to the Kimpton's rooftop bar, Merchant and Trade, for cocktails and music!",

We've had several different things and have loved them all, so just try anything that captures your attention.  The open kitchen is interesting to see and you don't hear a lot of noise from it, which is a nice benefit...enjoy the show, but it doesn't take over the dining room.  Their ventilation system is working well!  I hope they keep that in check.  This restaurant is in the Kimpton Tryon Park and Merchant and Trade is also here.  This can be a great progressive evening out without leaving the building!  I definitely will be back and recommend it to you!",

From the food to the service to the atmosphere, we were blown away by the impact of the dinner of our attendees. We had the beautiful table right at the entrance with 12 women - each month we focus on a different topic.   Our topic focused on meaningful connections through social media, how to make negative experiences online turn into good ones, what it means to make a social IMPACT through social influence, and what specific time management/self-care tricks can keep you in the present. We were able to hear each other perfectly in our private dining experience and the food was absolutely delicious.",

We asked what the waiter recommended and we then ordered several items to share based on those recommendations; the items were brought out at different times. The first item we were delivered was the calamari which I'd give a 2 - it lacked flavor and all you really tasted was the fried taste. Then came the melon and prosciutto which I'd give a 2 - for over $10 there was nothing to this dish, literally just 5 slices of prosciutto and a few chunks of melon. Next up were the Brussel sprouts which I'd give a 2 - these had 0 flavor and really it was just the shavings of Brussels sprouts rather than the actual sprouts themselves. We had a mashed potato pizza with sausage which I'd give a 2 - kind of a weird combo and certainly not worth $16.  Then we had the mussels which I'd give a 4- they were huge, full of labor, and awesome to share. Only downside is they were served without bread, and after we finished the mussels there was tons of broth in the bowl we wanted to try so we asked for a couple slices of bread which they later charged us $4 for. We also had the oxtail pasta which I'd give a 4 - it was flavorful and delicious, but there was not nearly enough meat to justify the $26 price tag.  Overall the ambiance was great, service was fine, food was really subpar. For a meal over $100 I would expect much more, especially when we ordered what the waiter recommended as the best items on the menu.",

The drinks are nothing memorable, but what was memorable was the attitude of the bar tenders. I understand you're a brand new restaurant in the new hotel in town, but, remember the town is Charlotte NC, not NYC. We sampled two of the pizzas also, again disappointing, the potato pizza lacked any real flavor, and both pizzas just left a bitter aftertaste in our mouths from the charred bits of crap stuck to the bottom of the crusts. I think next time, just stick to waiting in line to go upstairs.",

They had they're prefixed new years menu which had some good options. The appetizers were good but the main course we both ordered the ribeye medium rare and when we got it the dish was cold and both ribeyes were pretty rare which I don't mind but I would like what I ordered for a restaurant this nice. The veggies on the plate were also cold which made the dish all together disappointing. The flavor was good and I'm sure if I asked they would have made us a new dish but seemed like too much trouble. The dessert dishes were decent, the chocolate cake was okay just a little too bitter and the mousse I ordered was pretty good. The cocktails were really good also. I would give them another try with the regular menu to compare but maybe wait a while before I go back since they are fairly new.",

I travel to Charlotte quite often and while it's a pleasant city, the dining scene leaves a lot to be desired. Angeline's is hands down going to fill that void. The room is beautiful, the food is on point and the cocktail program was put together by someone who is in touch with the trends of larger/more advanced drinking cities. I went on opening night and it was packed. There were small clues that it was their first night but the overall experience was spot on. Shout out to Ron for the great service. Whole fish, sausage pizza and frito misto are all highly recommended.",

I made a reservation a week ahead of time and when we were seated no one was in the restaurant so I asked for a booth and they said they were all taken. I then watched two of the booths sit empty while we ate our meal which took several hours. The service was slow for so few people to be in there as well. The portions left a lot to be desired for such a high price. The food was fair, I could have made better carbonara at home (and have).

    "text": "I dined here on a Tuesday night and couldn't believe how crowded it was!!! Luckily, after waiting for about 5 minutes, I was able to snag a seat at the bar.  I started off with a glass of red wine (2015 Nero d'avila, Calea) and the whipped ricotta appetizer, which consisted of grilled sourdough bread surrounding a beautifully plated mixture of ricotta, lavender honey and pistachio.  I thought it was delicious (subtle hints of honey), but I would have liked for the bread to have been warm and a bit more of it so that the bread:ricotta cheese ratio was better balanced.  Something was missing though between the rich, creamy ricotta and the bland bread.  I was surprisingly full after this, but as always, had room for dessert! I decided on the classic Italian dish, tiramisu.  One of the bartenders seemed to forget about my order, so after about 10 minutes I had to kindly remind him.  The tiramisu was layered high and was topped with an espresso whip with edible gold.  It was just okay. It was the americanized version of tiramisu and was lacking a strong flavor.  For the whipped ricotta, glass of wine and dessert, my bill was about $35.  That is on the high side considering that I did not order a main meal.",

So if you have any questions, they know the answer. The waiters/waitresses also give good recommendations also. When the food comes out, I kid you not, it looks like something out of a magazine. They care about food presentation, which should be number one at any restaurant. I've had this place on my radar ever since they opened (For My Wedding) and I am glad I went.

Oh, The wine selection... many Italian wines but layout of the menu is difficult to select as price points are all mixed in. We asked for help selecting wine, our waitress said she wasn't sure so another server came over and offered a glass to try that he was sure we would love. It was terrible.. the waitress then said they had a wine steward who would help us. 5 minutes later she came back and said quote \"he doesn't have time for you right now\"... in amazement we asked what that meant, she said \"he's really busy and said just order something California that you're used to.\"  Upon picking my jaw up off the floor we said we would be glad to wait for him. We did and he was nice enough but clearly not well educated in listening to patrons requests. We found a fine bottle after talking with him and basically picking it out ourselves and it was ok in the end but never should have taken 30 minutes to get to that point.  The Waitress was pretty much useless, couldn't hear her, she rarely checked on us and seemed to care less about what she was doing. With so many other places that that have good service and similar food, they need to get it together. They have just opened recently so will maybe chalk all of this up to timing but I'm not spending my next night out there....",
