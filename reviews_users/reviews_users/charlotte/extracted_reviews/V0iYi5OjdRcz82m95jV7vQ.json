Also purchased the almond croissant and warmed up just a bit was equally delicious! I love this place ... It is a small shop in a short strip mall and so glad I found it!",

We even use them for making gift baskets for office occasions, etc.  A recent discovery is their brioche which we buy at least every other week - it's the source of our sunday french toast breakfast!  If you haven't visited them, you are missing out.  I also don't mind the location - I'd rather they spend their money on their friendly staff and their delicious creations - that's what I'm buying - not a fancy storefront.  Keep doing great things!",

Careful with  the pastries as some are not too fresh (e.g,, the Napoleon my husband had was old) and they are on the expensive side.  Their coffee was not fresh so I recommend requesting espresso based drinks to ensure freshness.  Not a good place to hang out or work as space is very limited and there is no WiFi.  Overall a good place to try out but not even close to Amelie's.",

Everything is fresh without preservatives so I don't recommend stocking up.  It's a place to consume that day...or shop frequently.  The quiches (traditional Lorraine and Spinach) were creamy and rich without being super greasy.  The appe tart was fantastic.  The macaroon were my lure.....mmmmmmmm.  Small with a big flavor...you don't need more.  It's easy to see why the French eat well and stay slim...the small macaroon satisfies the craving for sweet deliciousness that an entire bag of prepackaged cookies (like Oreos) can't.  The special coffee frother wasn't working, but the coffee snob in our group had a cup of their regular and loved it.  Didn't want to go get special coffee somewhere else as he had originally begged to do.  And the helpful clerk said they were working on having the frother work so perhaps when you go you can get the cafe au lait.    The pastry chef did come out and check on the display so he's a real French chef, not a machine.  It's going to cost more than mass produced goods, and it's not going to last as long...but your taste buds will appreciate it SSOOOOOOO much more.  Allons - y",

I also tried a vanilla macaroon, which was also harder than normal and tasted like it was left in the refrigerator too long. Unfortunately I left and went straight to Amelie's for my sugar fix.

I think I was the first person in at 7:10 a.m., which meant the Kouign Amanns were still warm. Mmmmm.  Renaissance was a little tricky to find since it's in an unassuming strip mall on South Blvd (in the same building as Monsoon Thai near Mac's), and the place is tiny. There is a small table with two chairs, but they look more like decoration than a place to sit and eat, so I got two Kouign Amanns and a cheese danish to go.   I got them home and gave the fella the danish and gave the Kouign Amann to my belly! I'd never had one before, but it was dense... chewy, caramelized sugar dough around the perimeter and fluffy, buttery dough in the middle. The fella said the danish was solid, but we split the second Kouign Amann, and he said that was definitely the winner.  It was only $12 for all three pastries, which I thought was pretty reasonable. There was a MASSIVE almond croissant in the cabinet that I'm already dreaming about for my second trip.",

    "text": "The best Almond Croissant in Charlotte, hands down, and the brewed coffee is excellent too!  Usually the simple things like brewed coffee and food quality are overlooked in favor of flashy advertising and hype. With an unassuming storefront and attention to all the savory details, Renaissance Patisserie is just the opposite. Even advice from the barista(?) on how to properly store leftovers for best flavor.  While I do love the ambiance of the 'other' French themed hangout in Charlotte, Renaissance Patisserie has really nailed the taste, texture and consistency of the main event.",

    "text": "I'm beyond thrilled. I've never been more excited to write a review.   My husband, knowing that I love all things French, recently surprised me with a trip to Renaissance Patisserie. It's really close to where I work, so I blame the fact that it's in an unassuming shopping strip that I've missed this place.   I was convinced that I would have to go to France or at least to New York to have authentically scrumptious French pastries again. I'm a self-proclaimed Francophile who's traveled to France several times and studied abroad there; it's when my love for French pastries and bread blossomed. I then lived in New York City, which also had a few good options due to the number of French people living there.  The almond croissant is my favorite thing, and the one here is phenomenal! It was just as good as the ones I've had in Paris and the one from my beloved patisserie in New York. So flavorful, so flakey, so perfect.   The interior is quaint and cute, with its bumblebee color scheme. The service was excellent and I loved that the woman working had a French accent (it's the little things, right?). The only complaint is the lack of tables and seating. It's more of a grab and go type of setup.   With more seating and space, I would come here over Amelie's any day. But, at the same time, I like that it's small. It feels more like a patisserie that you're stopping into for a croissant, opera cake or a baguette on your way to work or back home, just as the French do.   Merci beaucoup pour l'ouverture d'une vraie patisserie a Charlotte! J'ai hate de revenir!",

Usually it's not an issue and we leave the plate or design with them. There is usually a decorating fee but nothing crazy. They wanted to charge $45 PER DOG. Are you kidding me!?! On top of the $61 cake. So disappointed. Normally we would pay a $30-50 decorating fee for a very elaborate design. We walked out, child crying. We have to find a new cake place now. Very sad the original closed down. Would not recommend unless you want to pay over $200+ for a birthday cake.",

My wife and I split a slice of cake.  The cake itself was rather disappointing.  It was crumbly and a bit on the dry side.  When you put your fork in, the top half of the cake slide would fall apart from the bottom half.  The flavor was decent, but nothing great.  I had much preferred the pastries I had form the South Blvd. location (which, still looked tasty here!)  I also got an iced coffee which was pretty weak.  When I first got it, I thought they had made a mistake and given my unsweet tea.    Service seems to be having some growing pains.

The almond filling was moist and sweet, with a flaky pastry surrounding. And while not fluffy dough, it was very buttery. I cannot wait to return and try more desserts!

I had initially been drawn to the macaroons but wound up with two different quiche slices and a couple small deserts. I wouldn't mind going back & indulging myself when I have the funds available.

    "text": "Renaissance Patisserie came to the French Festival yesterday at Nevins Park. Since I have never been to their actual bakery in Charlotte, I can only provide my review of what they brought to the park from the bakery.  We waited on line at least 30 minutes so our expectations were set high already and we love fresh baked good from a patisserie, having stopped at authentic patisseries on our travels to France, Switzerland and Quebec. Just as we got to the booth to place our order, they announced that they ran out of crepes, the one item everyone in our group had decided on having. So we had to order our second choice. Quiche Lorraine and Feta-Spinach quiche served with a small salad. We also wanted the chocolate croissants, which they also ran out of as we got to the counter, so we settled for an almond croissant and a Nutella swirl pastry. We also picked up a two-pack of a rum-baba pastry called a Canelle. The quiche was served refrigerated without bothering to advised us that it would be cold and was tasteless, so we don't even know if it would have been edible if served hot. The salad consisted solely of a leafy lettuce and was very bland. The croissants were barely edible but we ate them because we were hungry and had to toss the quiche and salad after a few bites. The Canelles were very hard and tasteless and also had to be tossed after one bite. Over $50.00 out the window for this exasperating experience.  If their products really are any good, why on earth would they try to bring them to a park if they cannot duplicate the experience? While I am certain they made a lot of money yesterday, I doubt that they gained any new customers being exposed to their baked goods for the first time. In my experience in the business world for more than 45 years, the value of gaining new customers generally far exceeds any profits they may have made from yesterday!  WE WILL NEVER VISIT RENAISSANCE PATISSERIE AGAIN!",

I'll make it simple, stop in next time!   Rene was kind enough to explain everything, and I mean everything to us, after we told him it was our first time. How nice to say yes to that question! Everything looked so yummy, from the nice sized macarons, to the tiramisu, the meringue, I could go on. We selected the chocolate brownie cake and a chocolate croissant.   The croissant was lovely. Flaky, light with some chocolate in the middle. I would've liked for more chocolate, but I'm a bit greedy, so for someone who doesn't have such a raging sweet tooth- I'm sure it would be perfect.  And now for the piece de resistance...the chocolate brownie cake. I did my best to ignore the cries from the box all evening. I wanted to savor it the next day, but that didn't happen. Covered with my favorite ganache and a raspberry, underneath was a heap of mousse and a chocolate brownie on the bottom. Now let me explain, I don't very much care for mousse. But after one bite, I didn't care. It was magnificent. There were also chocolate chips dispersed throughout. Not too much, just a few. And it made the cake even better.  My daughter, who loves cakes with mousse, said it was even better than where she usually likes, which is the bakery at the Ritz Carlton. This place is worth five stars.",

    "text": "Let me write this review now that I have tried all the items purchased from RP.  We visited Williams-Sonoma and decided on lunch afterward.  We strolled the plaza and found this charming French cafe - Renaissance Patisserie.  We were warmly greeted and offered menus to order at the counter.  After a few moments we decided; I ordered the Pain Bagnat with a side of ratatouille and my partner chose the Salade Raclette.  We sat and waited for our food to arrive.  My WS bag was very tall so I placed it under the table, making a mental to not forget it.  After a short wait, our food was delivered to our table.  It was nicely plated and smelled great.  First, we both dug into the ratatouille.  It was all things ratatouille should be;  warm, tender, sweet and savory.  We ended up sharing this little delight.  My sandwich was quite well done.  No single element overpowered.  Each complimented the other to create a harmony of flavors.  The delightful garnish of a balsamic reduction on my plate proved to enhance the sandwich.  My partner's salad was equally nice.  At first glance, the dressing was slight but so flavorful.  The food had filled us up and the place was getting busy so we decided to pay and go since we had more shopping to do.  Late last night I suddenly realized I had left my WS bag under the table!!  Good grief!  I hoped whoever found it was honest and wouldn't make off with my treasured items.   I called RP this morning and gratefully they still had my bag with its contents.  I went down and while there decided to try their bottled French Onion soup.  I also ordered two croissants, all to go.  This afternoon I warmed up the soup.  This may be the best French Onion soup I have had.  It is $10 for a quart-sized jar which is spot on for what you get.  It is not salty which is great because once you add your crouton and swiss cheese it balances out.  The croissants were crisp on the outside and layered with a magical fluffiness.  We will definitely return to this lovely cafe to try some of the other delicious looking menu items.  Oh, btw, one of the employees informed me today that the Owner/Chef once worked for Ms. Oprah Winfrey.  Well then, there you have it!  :)",

The croissant was hard and flavorless, and the lady behind the counter had no means of warming it up at least. I looked to the coffee prep area and saw no milk/cream. I turned back to inquire, and she flatly replied that she was filling them right now. Behind her I saw 4 carafes, so I thanked her and sat down.   10 minutes later, those canisters were still empty.

Nicely baked, flaky, and plenty buttery. The almond filling was fragrant and nicely balanced throughout the entire croissant. They had brewed coffee that complimented the croissant well. I would definitely recommend Renaissance's almond croissant.",

I walked in and has the cutest, most eclectic French thing that you can imagine complete with the bistro tables and striped overhangs. There was such a good variety of pastries to choose from, pastries that I've never seen before but that looks so appetizing that I couldn't help but try one of each of what I was interested in. All the flavors of macarons were delicious: I tried the bubblegum, champagne, lavender lemon, and chamomile tea. While they aren't the best macarons that I've ever had, the variety in flavors had me swooning!  I also tried the latte, which was pretty good. Overall, I would say that it is a very good French bakery, but it's not the best that I've been to. However, that being said, I do not believe that you would be let down by coming here. It is fantastic, and is a excellent location in the specialty shops definitely a great little place to sit down, relax, and enjoy time by yourself or with friends.",

Sunflower in Ballantyne ties them for coffee and pastries (Sunflower has a vanilla swirl pastry that is tops).  Charlotte is fortunate to have two such great places for a great coffee and pastry to match. Chose your favorite or be a fickle lover of excellent pastries and switch back and forth.",

I ordered a bacon and brie croissant with caramelized onions.  I could eat this everyday, it was so good!  Went down a little too fast.

I'm always a fan of high quality french bakeries and this place does a good job of competing for the top spot in Charlotte.  Prices are a little high for the quantity but I don't mind paying a little extra for quality once in a while.  The ambiance inside is okay but not amazing, and its pretty small inside but i was there on a Sunday so it didn't look too overcrowded looked like some people were there studying and reading while enjoying a cappuccino.

I decided to indulge my sweet tooth this past Sunday and head over to Renaissance instead of getting breakfast at the hotel. I had a strawberry tart and a double espresso. The tart was heavenly: the almond base had a good structure and flavor, the custard was creamy and not overly sweet, and the strawberries were juicy and sweet with just a little glaze on top. The espresso was what you'd expect from Lavazza beans: robust and with a good crema.  The service was also warm, friendly, and professional. Case in point: I also ordered a piece of cake to take away, and the server accidentally gave me the wrong piece because of a misunderstanding. When I realized the mistake (I walked back to the hotel, discovered the error, and came back), they exchanged the slice with no fuss at all.  The outside seating area with bright yellow umbrellas overlooking the gardens of the mall's courtyard was very inviting. I would definitely recommend visiting if you are in the area.",

It is a Francophile's dream in terms of decor and pastry selections. I got a chocolate eclair and a caramel latte. They have great espresso drinks and several milks to choose from. The chocolate eclair was AMAZING! I mean, absolutely delicious and high quality. The flavor is complex and not just your typical display case offering.

It is the service that is lacking. I came in here on a Monday afternoon around 3:30.  There were 2 people in front of me and 2 behind me.  There was only one person working in the front, the rest were at the back baking.  I waited probably 20 minutes to order my croissant and a danish.  One guy actually just left without ordering anything.  I would have given them a five if service was faster but waiting that long just to put some pastries in a bag and pay for them is ridiculous. Hopefully they will hire more help!!",

My wife, who has spent time in Paris, said they were just like what you get in Paris.  I am something of a foodie and the pastry was spot on.  In fact about a half-hour after I had finished it the wonderful flavor was still gently on my palate.  What a great finish to a meal.  I plan to go back and try some other Items.    It is a bit hard to find.  I you go past Bricktops restaurant and turn right it is a few steps and on the left.",

    "text": "The closest this southern boy has ever been to Paris is the one in Florida... at EPCOT. I did have three years of French in high school however,  so I knew that \"patisserie\" meant \"bakery\" (sorta) which means fresh croissants, macaroons and lots of other sweet, buttery and flaky treats. So on a sunny Saturday morning, my wife and I ventured to the Southend area of uptown Charlotte to try this place for ourselves. According to my fellow Yelpers, it appeared to be a slam dunk.  We were greeted by the actual chef, who allegedly worked for Oprah... not so sure about that but he did have a French accent  and the chocolate croissants were supreme. They ran about $4 each. We also purchased a small chocolate birthday cake with buttercream icing. It was moist and delicious.  The store itself is tiny. There is room for a couple of two-seater tables but little else. They're also tables outside. The cafe-like atmosphere is very appealing and, most importantly, the display case, although small, has all of expected French pastries.  In Charlotte, when you mention French bakeries, the first one that pops into your head is usually Amelie's, which unfortunately has franchised itself all over Charlotte, and it has lost some of its appeal. With Renaissance, it's all about the pastries. We enjoyed it and look forward to its move to South Park.",

It's tucked away in a small high end shopping plaza and not visible from the parking lot. Upon entering, the girl behind the counter was super friendly and asked me if I liked bananas, then recommended the banana macaron. She also helped me narrow down what else to choose based on my palate, etc. Since I like chocolate she said the opera cake was popular, and I was like sure. This place is pricey but not too bad, considering the cake was really beautiful with the different layers and a gold foil accent. Taste-wise, I actually preferred the macaron - I couldn't really taste the banana but the cookie was delicate and chewy and the filling was super light and creamy. Definitely would come back for more macarons.",

    "text": "Great selection of classic pastries. I went in specifically to try the almond croissant - it's my favorite and whenever I get to go to Europe to see family or friends I would live on these. The one I had today was very unexpected. Taste - excellent and captures the essence of delicious almonds and marzipan. Texture - very surprising; it was like a large madeleines (French butter cake) / pound cake wrapped inside a thin layer of croissant. I love croissant because of the buttery, flaky and fluffy lightness of the dough, and for an almond croissant I especially appreciate a classic texture with a good amount of marzipan inside, and less of an almond butter cake that's wrapped inside a croissant like the one I tried today. Very dense. My husband loved his apple tart and he grew up with buttery apple tarts, so definitely recommend that if you love apple sweets! I enjoyed the berry tart - the berries were fresh and plump - the texture of the tart was surprising as well - it was more like a cookie tart. We would LOVE to see a few more gluten free options in the future. Wonder if they can do a fruit tart with almond flour? I look forward to returning and trying the classic croissant next. They also have chocolate and Nutella croissants. Definitely go support this local shop - in my opinion this beats Amelie in authenticity.",

    "text": "Cute!! This new little bakery hidden in a shopping center on South Boulevard is positively dripping with charm and French-iness. I wish the shopping center weren't so plain so this place stood out more.  I wish there were just a few more options. Everything in the case looked delicious, but there were several labels for products that were not there. And I get it, it's a bakery, and it's new, so you can't just continually stock products that might go bad before they sell, but still, a nice full case of pastries would help with visual appeal. They also had a refrigerated case with pasta sauce, sandwiches, and quiche. The girl behind the counter was delightful, helping us out with our orders and even offering a different pastry when my friend's daughter didn't like her \"pink cookie.\" (Apparently not every 3-year-old is a fan of rose macarons.) The rest of us didn't have that problem and gobbled up our treats, which were delicious. They also sell locally-roasted coffee, even though I've forgotten the name of the roastery. Sorry!  One downside was seating. The four of us plus a baby pretty much filled up the space. I was hoping for big, lounge-y chairs and tables. The chairs were adorable, but not very homey. This would definitely be a grab-and-go stop. If I could give half a star, this would be 3.5. I hope to see improvements in the future and I will definitely be back to check them out!",

I like that this bakery offers long hours from morning until 6 pm during the week and is open on Sundays, making it easy to grad something for a party or event. The window advertising cooking classes which I imagine would be amazing! I follow on social media so I'm often drooling over the latest pastry and wanting to stop in. My absolute favorite is the pain au raisins, a round wheel of pastry dough speckled with raisins that get juicy upon baking, it reminds me of the pastries I enjoyed in Paris where I learned to prefer the pain au raisins to traditional croissants. I also enjoy their large slices of quiche, for about $5 you can grab a very filling piece to take home and make a meal of. I love quiche and a small salad for dinner. Today I tried the seasonal pumpkin croissant, I'm assuming it was twice baked and I didn't love it, I haven't been impressed by any of the twice-baked pastries but it might just not be my preference over all.",

I also got an apple tart and again it was sooo good!! Above all it wasn't too sweet and it was just so real tasting. The ingredients I think must be really well chosen. I also got some meringues. These I wasn't so impressed with. They were hard as rocks the entire way through. I realize they are supposed to be crispy but these about broke our teeth. While that was a minor disappointment the croissants and tarts will more than make up for some bad meringues!! I can't wait to go back and try more things, especially some quiche and more croissants of course!!",
