    "text": "On the eve of Valentine's Day you should not pass this place up. I try to be stingy with my 5 stars so they're meaningful. Every time I'm been here since they've been open I am simply delighted. First there is a their selection for all the moods of my palette. Sometimes I want something sweet but not as heavy as chocolate, they have key lime pie. Maybe you'd rather have a macaron or three. Of course there any variety of chocolate confections: cupcakes, cake, mousses or signature chocolates all perfect to share after a dinner out on the town or after a stroll thru uptown. When I have company my favorite thing is to dip in & get two hot chocolates.  The food is what brings me there but it's the atmosphere & the prices that keep me coming back. For being inside the Ritz Carlton I feel that I have spent less money here than at Amelie's. Once you have your desserts in hand, if you came looking for quiet conversation, I'll give you a hint later. There are certainly the little tables but if it's a blustry evening avoid them as people can't seem to work the revolving door that is to keep the wind from blowing onto you. You could take your desserts down to the hotel bar if you want liveliness or are pairing your treat with a cabernet or port.   Hot Chocolates in hand take the stairs down to the bar, go thru the bar and hang a right. The loveseats along the wall by the elevator are the place to get to know someone.",

The pricing isn't too bad either, about $2.75 for a small gelato, and I don't normally like sweets so this was more than enough for me, not to say I didn't devour every drop of it.  The decor is beautiful, a trendy and hip place to have a drink and munch on a little bit of sweetness.",

The chocolate vanilla mousse seemed chocolatey & not sure where the vanilla was.  It was ok but it was not light & fluffy or a thick & creamy concoction as you might expect mousse to be.  It was chocolatey.  The Carmel Banana tart I was really excited as a carmel person vs. a chocolate person.  I could not find the carmel or the banana.  In both cases, the salesperson indicated the 0.5 mile I needed to walk back to the office before eating it would be ok unrefrigerated & it was a cooler day for CLT.  So I don't know if the temperature had anything to do w/it.  Dulce gelato was very tasty & I would return for it.",

I was disappointed though in the coldness of the service I received... the individuals working weren't \"rude\" per se, but they certainly were not friendly by any means... and if I'm going to pay $7 for a tiny opera cake, I expect at least a smile.  Having read the other reviews, it sounds like it is possible to receive great service here... however, it needs to be consistent in order for this place to be worth the money they are charging for their desserts...  Regardless, the cupcakes were great so I'd possibly give this place one more try since it is so convenient to my office... but I do not see myself going out of my way to visit...",

It has all the hallmarks to be an exciting addition to the Uptown snack area.  The deserts are fabulous - expertly made.  The staff is friendly.  The location is spot on (inside the Ritz, across from the Epicenter and many of the office towers Uptown).  Why two stars then?  All of the well done bits go to waste if there is no one to serve you the delights!  I work Uptown and like many folks get a hankering for something sweet in the late afternoon, this would be a go-to place.  But the last several times I walked over, there was no one around to serve me or take my money!    Understand the value of someone buying a couple caramels or truffles is not nearly as high as a room at the Ritz or even a glass of wine at the bar... but it's disappointing customer experience to see all these beautiful treats behind glass and the no way to get to them.  Unfortunately, they lost me (and anyone I drag along for a treat) as a customer because of this pretty significant gap.",

For a sit down meal or tea/coffee/desserts, I would feel uncomfortable not dressing up. I decided to sit down just to finish the desserts and coffee since I ordered more than I should have and noticed many people were walking in (loud and obnoxious) and just strolling around in their general area. That sort of disrupted my mood to enjoy the rest of my dessert so I quickly finished and left.  The service was fine as I had ordered at the counter and paid there.",

    "text": "I went to Bar Cocoa last night with my family ( there were 5 of us including my 10yr old daughter). We were excited because we are a sweet crazed family! I was looking forward to some gelato even though it was a bit cold outside but sadly, out of the 5 flavors offered, none were to my liking. My favorite flavors are anything with chocolate or caramel but neither were offered.   My family immediately gravitated toward the cake display so I joined them. Two people purchased chocolate cupcakes, one a red velvet cupcake, another the pumpkin cheesecake and I got the coconut cake. The service at Bar Cocoa was great! The gentleman was friendly, smiling and very pleasant. At the bar they only offered coffee and hot chocolate. We were encouraged to grab a seat at the Ritz Carlton lounge area where we would be offered a wider selection of drinks.  Our desserts were all just average tasting. No one, including myself, was wowed by anything. I usually love most coconut flavored anything but this cake was filled with big chunks of coconut flakes. I couldn't detect any actual cake in there at all. It was unpleasantly chewy. I don't recommend it.  The lounge in the Ritz was dimly lit with a beautiful stone fireplace toward the back where there is a second bar serving cocktails. The lounge area was fairly empty. There was one table occupied with a couple. My family and I sat down and were noticed by the female server as we walked in but she didn't approach our table. I found that odd but I waited. About 5 minutes later she went to the table with the couple and asked them if they wanted more drinks. She took their order, left, and promptly returned with their drinks. Then she left again without coming over to us. Another 5 minutes goes by and a second couple enters the lounge area with their desserts from Bar Cocoa. As as they're seated she approaches their table and asks if they want anything. Then she leaves again without even looking our way. At that point we were almost done and didn't want to stay any longer with such rude and dismissive service.   I am not sure why she chose to ignore our table but I was extremely disappointed. I expected better from such an establishment. With mediocre desserts and horrible service I definitely won't be going back or bringing anymore guests with me when looking for a place to satisfy our sweet tooth. I give the two stars for the gentleman that served us our desserts.",

There was an incredible line, they were out of hot chocolate and many of their dessert offerings. To enjoy your treats you have to just sit in the hotel lobby.  Maybe I should have done more research but I expected to find something a little higher end and certainly more well-run since its associated with Ritz Carlton.",

There are so many different things you can have. From cupcakes to cannolis, to bon bons and tarts.  After bombarding the guy behind the counter with about 54 questions (kudos to his patience with me) I decided on their signature dessert, Bar cocoa. When the guy described it as a gourmet kit kat, I was in! I LOVE kit kat.  It was 7:00, but it was a very good size and it was clearly a gourmet and labor intensive dessert. OMG AMAZING! I was so happy with my choice! It was so decadent with a great crunch from the praline. OH and it was hazelnut chocolate, my favorite! A friend of mine got the chocolate cupcake which was amazing as well. The cake was very moist and chocolatey while the icing was perfect!  I'll be back when I'm in Charlotte.",

There are cases filled with macaroons, cupcakes and other confections and everything looks beautifully well done.  The atmosphere is very nice with a lot of comfortable seating and low lighting.

For a place you'd think is overpriced because it's in the daunting Ritz-Carlton, it's actually way cheaper than other places that sell similar sweets (namely, Amelies) in the area. 2$ macarons, 2.50$ cupcakes, 6$ beers, and a chill seating area with a fancy vibe,  it literally can't get any better. The night we went, they had a jazz band playing. In the middle of our sitting, however, they started to put out little signs saying that tables were reserved for those spending 20$+.  I don't know how often that happens. Maybe just on Saturdays, maybe just on live jazz show days?   Whatever the pattern, I hope I'll go enough to figure it out!",

I had couple of delicious French macarons (coconut, pistachio, and coffee) and one really pretty but really, really, really dry and oily red velvet cupcake...I know it sounds contradictory but it almost tasted like old cake that someone tried to revive by soaking it in melted butter and lard. The worst part was the service was awful. The guy behind the counter had the personality of the Grim Reaper. No smiles, treated customers like a 12 year old would treat chores (a lot of sighing and eye rolling).  Because the French macarons were so good I decided to stop by a month or two later while I was at a meeting uptown just to give Bar Cocoa a chance to redeem itself. Bad mistake! The macarons were so hard and dry I thought I was going to chip a tooth. Why some were dry, some were so soft they were almost mushy and tasted undercooked. The same guy was still there, with the same horrible service. No smile and not an ounce of personality. I mean c'mon now, you don't have to love your job but you have to make the best of it.  Coming from the Ritz, I would have expected them to be more picky when it came to choice of staff. The staff in the hotel itself is wonderful but the staff at Bar Cocoa needs improvement.

I'm not an orange flavor lover but that cupcake was out of this world. It was the featured cupcake of the day. The cake part was moist and very mild in flavor. It was filled with sweet cream cheese and topped with the awesomest souped-up orange scented cream cheese frosting. I can't begin to explain how much I enjoyed this cupcake. Wow! The 2 macaroons were enjoyed by my 8 year old. She said they were awesome. Nuff said!   Ugh!  I need to come back here SOON!",

They serve Nespresso style espresso drinks which means it most likely comes out of the little pods... if you're looking for a Great espresso stop I probably wouldn't recommend here since it's going to be an automated process.  I am impressed at what the nespresso machines can do but I still prefer the traditional method and fresh espresso other coffee shops have to offer.  In summary, I would be coming here for the bakery items, the macaroons, and the gelato with coffee being an after thought. Will return for those items.",

    "text": "Decided to head uptown for a bit of dessert and landed at Bar Cocoa. We had initially only intended to stop for Gelato but were instantly attracted to all the gorgeous truffles and confections and ended up totally gorging ourselves on sweets.  Tried the Pistachio Gelato, the texture was heavenly and accompanied by a crisp crunch of fresh nuts. We also sampled a variety of truffles (Lemon Bar, Tahitian Caramel, German Chocolate Cake, and Caramel Macchiatio). Each was artistically crafted and resembled a brightly colored gem. We also shared a slice of Coconut Cake. Everything had it's own unique and enticing flavor and I am not embarrassed to say we ate it all!   The barista was patient and helpful and made sure we fully enjoyed each of our selections. Absolutely decadent!",

When I told the Dude working here (he asked how we liked our Desserts) I told him and he made some suggestions and brought over two that he thought we would like!  The Girl working here was very helpful getting the Most Photogenic of each item we chose (I told her I would photograph these and she had some good ideas)!  What was really Good or Better than good :   All of These Desserts are BEAUTIFUL!!!  Macaroons were exceptional!  Better than \"Amelie's\" More comparable to \"Think Chocolate\" in Ballantyne!  Red Velvet, Orange Sickle and Pistachio were the best of the five we tasted!  Cream Cheese Icing on Top of a Carrot Cake Cupcake!  My Bride and I enjoyed this Icing which is VERY Rare since I prefer a Butter Cream Icing and only a Rare Cream Cheese Icing... Usually only one of us likes the same... I this particular situation we BOTH thought it was EXCEPTIONAL! ! !  The Cake had a very Fine Flavor, Like a Sweet Carrot Bread, much less sweet than Cake which was Nice for us since we already had so much Dessert!  Peanut-butter and Jelly Creation, this was the Yellow most Unusual and Unique Looking of what they had!    What needs work :  The Dessert Named after the place \"Bar Cocoa\" was very poor, as if someone took fine ingredients and some how made them look Marvelous and taste CHEAP!  This was so poor we only took a few (small) bites and left the rest! 1 yelp star  Same story with the Very Beautiful Tart (Chocolate and Banana) tasted very Artificial and CHEAP! less than one yelp star  Gelato had very little flavor 2 yelp stars at the most!  We were here last Saturday Night 4-27 for my the Dessert Part of a Birthday Celebration for my Bride!  We did not taste any of the Chocolates and would go back to see what they were like IF we lived here!",

The woman helping was friendly and informative about some allergies we had to worry about when making our selection. We chose a cupcake and chocolates and the total was under $10.

There is a nice view of uptown from the patio and comfortable seating to people watch.   I was hoping for a milkshake that day, but they only offer them certain times of the year.  I had a cup of gelato which was tasty...creamy and flavorful.  The staff was friendly.  Everything in the case was beautiful and looked so delicious and delightful!!",

I first enjoyed a piece of candy (upwards of 2.50) - salted caramel dark chocolate.  It was the perfect portion and was scrumptious.  Later (in the wee hours of the morning), I enjoyed eating the chocolate cupcake that definitely hit the spot.  However, Bar Cocoa get 4 stars because I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine with my chocolate cupcake but was unable to find a seat in the bar areas to the left of the baked goods.  The time was around 10:00PM.  This isn't a problem for a business but it was a problem for me.",

I like to top my ice cream with the cookie dough macaron which looks just like Cookie Monster - very adorable! It is open until 10 on weekdays and has a cool vibe to it so it's a great spot to hang out post dinner or happy hour! I haven't tried their other desserts but I'm sure they're just as yummy! I recommended this place to my cousin this past weekend when he was in town with a group of volunteers. He said the place was a hit - high recommend!",

Whenever I have guests in Charlotte I always make sure to include this chic little spot on our itinerary.  Bar Cocoa offers dark, milk, or white hot chocolate which, in my opinion, is revolutionary! My man ordered white and I ordered milk and they were both totally divine. The place is connected to a lounge that was playing awesome jazz music which really added to the ambience.   Bar Cocoa has the most beautiful, creatively-flavored, air-brushed truffles that were incredibly sumptuous. Enjoying decadent chocolate with your partner, watching glamorous people walk the Charlotte streets, listening to the sexy sounds of jazz floating your way...I cannot think of a more romantic place than Bar Cocoa!",

Today there was someone I'd never seen before so I was hoping she would be pleasant. Boy was I wrong! I asked for two desserts, which I was going to give to my friends for each one of their birthdays. She put them in the same box and turned the box vertical in the bag so that both desserts smashed on top of each other. Then she kept the bag behind the counter. When I went to pay, she simply stared at the screen for a full 3 minutes. The screen was apparently frozen so I had to ask \"is the machine working?\" to which she replied \"nope\". Once the machine was finally working, she ran my card and walked away. I had to reach over the counter and around to retrieve my bag which is now a $14 smushed mess. Disappointed. Won't be back.",

The little coffee and cakes shop has a variety of coffees,  cakes, gelato, etc.   The prices are a lot more reasonable than I expected, knowing that it is connected to the Ritz Hotel.   I ordered a pistachio gelato  and an apple macaron. The small gelato was really  big, even for the small size,  If I had known i would probably have asked for two flavors. The gelato was good  but not amazing, I got tired of it half way thorough, which is a problem I don't typically have with Gelato.   My macaron was not great either, it was kind of crumbly, my companion had the raspberry one and that was great, I think the apple cream was not as good as the raspberry jelly.  My favorite part was being able to hang out in the fancy Ritz Carlton hotel while eating ice cream.",

They had not many options, but there's something for everyone. They had cookies, gelato, cupcakes, mini cakes and truffles! The presentation was beautiful and everything seemed fresh and it sparkled! It was beautiful. I got a Mississipi Mud Pie, it was moist and delicious. Not to mention it's in the Ritz hotel, you can stay and eat on there as well!",

There were many options and the employees were really helpful. We went low key and both left with cookies, snickerdoodle and peanut butter at $1.50 each. They were perfectly chewy!   This is a really cute date night spot!",

Though we did not get any desserts they all looked amazing.   We were in the area in a cold day and googled the best hot chocolate near us and this place came up. My husband and brother both got the hot chocolate but I got a small cappuccino instead. The hot chocolate (because of course I still had to try it) had a very smooth and creamy texture. They loved it! It also had like a cinnamon flavor in it. It wasn't your basic hot chocolate, it was definitely elevated. The cappuccino was pretty standard.   Once ordered there's a little hall that takes you down to a seating area. There a restaurant there but also some couches in front of a fireplace. It was super nice!",

My absolute fav are the cookies, which are baked in house and vary daily and yes they are addictive.  The gelato sometimes seem to have freezer burn so I usually don't order that.  Occasionally I get a cupcake but pass me the white chocolate macadamia cookies because they are amazing and my fav and usually available on Fridays.",

It is very easy to miss, since it's tucked into the corner entrance, and you can easily sneak by without even realizing that they are there.  On one side you have the truffles and drinks, on the other, an excellent display of macarons and other sweets, and though small, it's a great way to grab a small bite to take with you as you wander elsewhere.",

It is a dangerous place for me because I walk through these doors every night I am in town. I end up getting a dessert on my way up to my room way too many times.  It's a good thing I am only in Charlotte for a week. I have tried their signature dessert, the Bar Cocoa, and it was delectible!!! I loved the little crunch at the bottom and the smooth, rich, creamy mousse in the middle with a little glaze of raspberry on top. I have also had their key lime bar and it is sooooo good with a cup of espresso. It is not too tangy and has like a shortbread kind of shell. I love key lime but some are too tart for me. This was perfect! I want to try one of their cupcakes next. The chocolate, red velvet and carrot cake looks too good and moist! At $2.50 each cupcake I might have to give in and take all three. Splurge a little!",
