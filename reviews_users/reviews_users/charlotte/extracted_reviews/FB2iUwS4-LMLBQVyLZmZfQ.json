When I walked in the place it smelled like dirty mop water. The seats were sticky from split drinks. We ordered a pitcher of Margarita and it was like mix and ice only. Later that night they were having some club event and before we got dinner came by to collect $15 from everyone at the table. Complete BS since nobody even had their meals yet. No body told us there was a cover before and if there is tell people before your seated. Since we refused to pay our service got worse and even though we should have walked out my friend and I went to hunt for our check and the manager had the nerve to ask our dates to pay the cover again. We paid our bill and left that S. Hole for the last time.",

Forget the multitude of restaurants and roadside cartas within the great country of Mexico I have been fortunate enough to come across on my journeys south of the border. The greatest thing about Zapatas Mexican Cantina \"The Employees\" the food is good for what it is, dumbied down Mexican food for the average Joe. It wasn't too long ago there was no other choice but to put up with the dumby downed mexican restaurants in Charlotte but over the past ten years or so there has been an influx of great authentic Mexican restaurants and Taquerrias springing up all over Charlotte mainly on South Blvd and Central.  If you are not as adventurous as The Epicurean Cowboy. Than perhaps this is as good as it gets for you. Again not a bad place and made even better by the great staff. Escpecially Olevera our favorite. BTW the special salsa upon request is perhaps the best in Charlotte. As a matter of fact I will go on record and declare it is by far the best I have experienced in North Carolina.",

This was probably the most enjoyable part of our experience. The menu is extensive but the food was just blah. There were also ingredients in my burrito that weren't listed in the description. It was supposed to include mushrooms, onions, and chicken. There were thick slices of carrots and zucchini. Wouldn't have minded if the food was cooked correctly. Chips were stale, cheese dip was lukewarm at best. The server disappeared so long that we almost walked out before ordering but I was starving so we stayed. Then when it was time to go, the server was again no where to be found. Also caught management and servers arguing. I am fluent in spanish, so there was no disguise to what was really going on. Will definitely never go back here again. We would have been better staying home and eating a frozen pizza.",

The salsas to start were watery and the mild tasted solely of black pepper. That was just weird. The chips were plentiful but very bland. They needed salt in a bad way and I rarely need to add salt to anything.   We were barely seated less then a minute when the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  Seriously. I had just opened my menu. Also, no specials on Saturday? That was weird.   I ordered the chimichanga and asked for queso on the side because I like my chimichanga crunchy. When it came out, there was some other red sauce on it. Dang. Defeated the purpose of a crispy shell but at that point I was ready to eat anything besides the chips and bad salsa.   I really wanted this place to be awesome so it could go in the rotation of \"Places we can walk to for Lunch\".  It deserves 1 1/2 stars but I'll be generous and give them a 2. Save your money and put it towards gas to drive to a decent Mexican place.",

It is always our go-to when we have out of town guest visiting.  The loss of a star is because while the food is always good, the quality of service can vary.

The freshly warm corn chips and salsa (very fresh cilantro) were destroyed by the Mrs. and me within a few minutes and they promptly brought out another fresh batch.  Service was polite and very accommodating with some minor special requests for our entree order.  All was right with our little faux Mexican world.    Then the entree came.  Tempura Fish Taco, Chicken Burrito and a Beef Chimichanga.  Nothing really wrong with any of them, just not that good.  Quite underwhelmed after the positive beginning to the dining experience.  The shredded chicken in the burrito was too soggy inside and the fish taco was just lacking in sauce and overall zip that great fish tacos bring.  Again, nothing really wrong, just all a little boring and run of the mill.    FYI: My wife ordered the tempura fish tacos as well and requested they grill non breaded fish (she's Gluten Free).  They were happy to accommodate but after dinner she got a pretty bad gluten reaction so there was still gluten in the tacos somewhere...such is the plight of a GF person trying to dine out :(",

I sat outside and our waiter was quick.The guacamole & queso were tasty followed by their enchiladas. I will be returning for sure!",

Well, the service was substandard (waitress didn't really interact with us or come to check on us at all during the meal) to start. But the food? So plain and flavorless. I could have made the taco salad myself...it was iceberg lettuce with ground beef that looked like it had a packet of seasoning thrown in, just like I make at home. The tacos I got were just okay, but didn't wow me. We were bummed because we had been eating at all wonderful restaurants during our time in Charlotte for 4 days, but then we had to end on this note before driving back to the airport. Normally I'm not as critical about restaurants as most other people, but this one was really not great in our book. Will definitely not go back.",

The waiter took our drink orders and appetizer orders and chips were delivered just as quickly.  There is a lot of unique items on the menu and it took us a little bit to decide.  The appetizers arrived fairly quickly.  We had the guacamole, which was great, and the philly egg rolls which my husband loved.  He said he could order those as a meal.  Shortly afterwards our meals arrived.  My son and I had the Aloha tacos and my husband ordered the street tacos.  Everything was great, no complaints.

The second time we went my wife tried the tortilla soup. We fished out about a pound of tortilla strips from the soup. The taste was strait out of a can but the chicken chunks were lean. Everything we law we had was underwhelming.   The worst part of the evening was the service. The young gal service is had zero personality, rarely stopped by to fill our water or drink glasses and the only time she smiled was when the check came. My wife insisted on zero tip but I gave her a little for bringing the food to us.   The reason I bring this up is that our first encounter there was positive. The server was kind, funny, attentive and I gave her a $50 tip!  The second time will be our last.  The woman manager (I assume she is) was out observing everything and if you can't tell that a server is substandard, then I'll take my business elsewhere.   Makes all the difference.   I'm a firm believer that customer service makes up for crappy food it makes good food taste bad.   But if you insist on going, the chili relleno is solid, carne asada burrito was delicious, shredded beef was nasty and stay away from the chicken tortilla soup. I'm no food critic but I travel the continent weekly and eat at every recommended dive and fine dining establishments. I also grew up in Los Angeles so I know what good ethnic food tastes like.   You won't find it here",

Brightly painted walls and interior decorations made it feel like an Americanized version of a Mexican villa.  Nice digs, it was kitschy homey.    Located over by the burger joint in Ballantyne that shan't be named (bleh), I headed here for an after work meal that was going to require cheese dip.  And cheese dip was had ($4.50).  Creamy and very good, served with substantial chips that held up to the dipping, but I was quickly filling up on.  The table salsa was cilantro-heavy with a kick, so I passed on that.    My entree order was a General Combo, which is a pick 2 combo that I chose a chimichanga and a taco for, both beef.  The combo comes with rice and beans ($11).  The beef was over-seasoned - the first thought was too salty, but it wasn't just salt.  And not over-seasoned meaning spicy - just too much stuff that overwhelmed everything.  I poured what was left of my queso on everything and ate what I could.  The rice was typical mexican joint rice, as was the beans, though the beans had a little more flavor than most places, almost a little smoky - but in general the same rice/bean taste as Azteca, Monterrey, etc.   The service was exceptional (it says Hector on my receipt).  He was friendly and attentive, my drink never went empty and he checked on me without aggravating.  Overall a good experience, but nothing extraordinary.",

I've been here many times and for the first time tried a menu option outside of my normal comfort zone.....Pollo con Mole - chicken breast braised in a sweet spicy peanutbutter based sauce with a hint of cinammon.  Really interesting flavors.  I think I'll add it to the rotation.  Other guests in our party that night had fajitas which looked and smelled delicious.

    "text": "Living in South Carolina means Mexican food does not come by very often. I think the last time I had food like this was in February, so I've been pretty hard pressed for non-Moe's food.  With that in mind, Zapata's has plenty of non-burrito options, but for the fare of enchiladas, tacos, and a pretty extensive specialities menu, I thought it was kind of expensive. I got the enchiladas de mole, and even though the rice and beans were pretty standard, it was just what I wanted for my fix. I liked the mole sauce and the salsas for the table, but I noticed that our food looked like it had been waiting for a little bit when it came out. One of my friends ordered the Street Tacos, and she contests that they are among the best she's ever had.   I think the aura of the place and the service is what makes Zapata's stand out from the neighborhood Mexican fixture of long combination menus. The place is huge on the inside, and the high ceilings had good decorations and a lot of conversation buzzing around. My favorite item was a line of rusty horse sculptures bursting out of the wall.  It's definitely worth checking out for a birthday as well: lots of surprises and fun that only an energetic and attentive wait-staff can bring.",

    "text": "Went there 2 weeks ago with my daughter and a friend, disappointed with the bad service, food was ok but as someone who knows Mexican food and eats out frequently, it did not really taste as such.  For the amount of food the price was too high.  If I saw the waiter 3 times from the time I was sat down, that was too many. The restaurant is very nicely decorated even though the booth seat was too hard and stiff so it was hard to be comfortable. My friend mentioned the men's restroom stall was filthy.  Only to bring the check was he quick.  But the biggest surprise was when I saw the bill and noticed he had assigned himself an 18% tip of the bill!!  I was not going to make a scene and simply paid the bill but in all my years of eating out I had never seen that in a party of 3- it is usually understood to be applied for larger parties.   Now I see why he did not even try to provide good service, he had already assigned himself a nice tip.  I was planning to not leave a tip- but it seemed he and Zapatas felt they decide what they deserve.  There are many other places with better service and food not to far from there. Tried once- never again.",

Couple sitting at table next to us did not get a gratuity charge (we asked). Was told that some patrons don't tip...but why not be consistent and fair? We were not happy as we were a party of a 2 not 6 or more.  Food was bland, service slow, chips and fajitas cold. Asked why my fajitas did not come out sizzling but was ignored. The underneath of tables need to be cleaned as there smashed chips and trash.  Disappointed and won't return.",

We got there right around 1 and were a little scared that there wasn't much of a crowd inside, but decided to push on. We were quickly greeted and seated.  The inside is nice and cozy with a outdoor/indoor southwest/Mexican theme. As soon as we were seated a server brought us a huge bowl of salsa chips and two glasses of water.   We figured out that the water was to help with the spice in the salsa, unfortunately that's the only thing good about the salsa it was tomato paste based so it tasted a little like spicy pizza sauce to me.  We also ordered a thing of cheese dip. Smokey, spicy, large (it felt like that bowl was bottomless)  and delicious. For lunch my wife ordered the nachos, large portion of chips  topped with chicken, beans, peppers, sour cream, and guacamole.  She liked them but f.y.i. they use shredded chicken,& shredded cheese vs fajita chicken & cheese dip.  I ordered the fish tacos.  (3 flour tortillas with thin sliced fried fish with a chipotle cream sauce served with rice and beans) These puppies were awesome. They were pretty spicy but soooooo very good.  All in all it was GREAT food GREAT service  only thing i could find any fault on was the salsa. I'm looking forward to going back.",

But this is real comida Mexicana, amigos. The prices are extremely fair (don't go to Cantina 1511), the food is fresh and you can tell that the refried beans are homemade.

Victor makes my favorite margarita of all time.

Finally we talk to him just to tell him we waited long and our food was cold. We had already paid so we weren't looking for free food like the manager Carlos suggested. He then said we were lying about the cold food because he cooked it himself. And walked away waving bye to us. I have seriously never seen such rude behavior.

I had a Bombay chimichanga and it was vegan without the cheese sauce on top.  Very good. Would recommend the other food that my party had that was not vegan. Everyone really liked it.

The guacamole made table side is also delightful. Their margaritas are good, I have tried several. I like the free chips and salsa too. As for service--I think they have some good servers and some okay servers. It depends on how busy they are. Every one has been polite when we dine inside. The patio is nice in warm weather too.",

So awesome that you should stop reading this and just go to Three Amigos and eat an empanada.   Zapatas is not delicious. At all. We went for a friend's birthday party. They were closing at 11 and we were the last to get there so they told our friend we had to order at 10:30 if we wanted to eat. So, without seeing a menu, we just ordered a standard chimichanga via our friend over the phone. When we got there, our food was on the table. Here is how I knew it was going to be not so good - the refried beans had melted CHEDDAR cheese on it. Not the normal, name-I-don't-know white cheese but shredded cheddar you get from Harris Teeter. It was not tasty at all. The rice was bland. The chimichanga was dry. I honestly have nothing good to say other than I hope you read my post and avoid this place.",

I saw a phone at the stand and I called from my cell phone hoping that would trigger someone to come up front...Nope. I finally went to the bar and spoke with the bartender. He sat us right away but it took forever for someone to come greet us!   I ordered a fajita burrito with steak. When I received it, I saw it had chicken in it. Took forever for the server to come back so we can tell her the issue. I got my burrito with steak but it was very sloppy looking from them rushing. My husband got the chicken fajitas and it was sooooooooooooo greasy and oily. I've never seen fajitas like that.   Very disappointing. Looking at the other reviews I'm surprised that they are rated either very good or very low. There are so many other good mexican restaurants in the ballantyne area and I just can't believe the service here was that bad.",

Food is good and the atmosphere is a perfect rendition of Mexican restaurants, with party areas, decorations, tables and chairs and even beverage blown glasses.  The wait staff are really good.  They explain what is what and will accurately deliver on exceptions, like adding onions, or with or without sauces and substitutions.  And the kitchen can turn out meals rather quickly.  We have been here with grandchildren and there is a Latino sweetness toward children.  The wait staff will laugh with them and somewhat entertain them in a warm, loving way.    Portions are great.  If you get a platter you get excellent re-fried beans and rice that you might not be able to finish.  The main course are equally ample.  Drinks come in those before mentioned blown glass and the margaritas in stemmed glasses with cactus stems (simulated in glass, of course).  And the bar is very large with some seating in that area.  Both lunch and dinner are the same.  We have had good repeat visits so upgrade Zapata's to four stars.",

Great made-to-order guac - yes, they will gladly hold the salt, and add more cilantro!  Ritas are always terrific...sometimes too much so!  Drinks and nachos at the bar is a good choice too.  My measure of a great MX spot it their chili rellenos and Zapata's is consistently great!  During our dozens of visits we have eaten our way around the menu of freshly-made selections from typical \"border-MX\" to some of their less common fish, shrimp, and meat dishes; all are consistently done authentically.  Service is consistently \"appropriately\" attentive under the watchful eye of Niko, and they handle large groups well.  Outdoor al fresco is fun on their porch, especially with kiddo's.  There is a large grassy area and fountain where they can play, and even a large Magnolia tree for climbing.  No - I don't own stock and can be a harsh critic (see my other reviews) so their reputation with my family and I is well earned.  Enjoy!",

This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in CLT thus far. I love the chips & salsa! The chips are nice and thin. Warm with just enough salt. The guacamole is really good as well.  My bf and I shared the a chicken, steak, & shrimp fajita dinner. Single serving is a Perfect size for two! I was afraid we would need to order more but we were fine.   I will be back when I need a good Mexican fix.",

Instead of inserting it so the chip could be read or.... swiping it...this member of MENSA decided to enter the numbers manually. Unfortunately for me this throws up an immense flag to my bank. They immediately declined the charge and flagged my account as suspected fraud! Thank you to my bank for watching my back.....KMA to the idiot who doesn't know how to run a charge card!",

    "text": "We ordered to go and yeah, we weren't very happy. Maybe there is something to be said about \"what you are used to\", because I have seen some good ratings given to this place, but it just didnt work for me.   I ordered the Sante Fe Chimichanga. For $12.50, I was surprised to get home and figure out in only included one. Other places I have been to, there are usually 2. I mean, they did give me a HUGE container of rice, but I mean...... I didnt really order this entree for the rice. The chimichanga itself was soggy, which was weird because I had the sauce in a container on the side. My experience with a chimichanga is that it is basically a fried burrito, but this thing was thick and soggy. I'm not even sure it was a flour tortilla because of how thick it was. And if it's deep fried, how does it get soggy? Like I said, maybe I am just used to something different (better) because other people have said that they enjoy the chimichangas here........ oh well.   Personally, I didn't enjoy it at all. I ate most of it, I mean it was almost $13 for ONE. I will say that the poblano queso was pretty tasty on its own, but I didnt like the main dish.  The others got their food and said it was \"meh....\", nothing special...... I mean, its hard to mess up a quesadilla, right? The fajitas were ok I was told, but may be better if eaten there. They said the chips were decent but the salsa was bland.   I dont know if I will be back. They are right near my apartment, so maybe... on a night where nothing else sounds good. But they are not near the top of the list. My search for a good chimichanga in Charlotte will continue.",

To be given this sad excuse of a meal that was extremely overpriced was very disappointing. My veggie fajitas looked like a frozen bag of birds eye veggies dumped on a hot skillet. My aunt fish taco was a fush stick with alot of breading. My mothers boneless \"wings\" was freaking chicken tenders drenched in sauce. The waiter whom was pleasant at first even asked if I enjoyed the meal once noticing we all pretty much left full plates. However didn't mentioned for anything to be done about.  Even the cocktails Im sure didnt have alcohol added. Or shall I say was so watered down. But nothing shocked us as bad as a 18% added gratuity which def was not deserved. We could have fought it but I was still so hungry that I was becoming hangry. Basically if you want food that Taco Bell taste better than and at fine dining prices go here!",

Great value for the lunch combinations which are $8.00 and we always make two meals out of them. Salsa good though I've had better. Sometimes the salsa is thin. They serve a Mexican slaw with the lunch as an added bonus and it is quite good. Ask for it on the side because if it is placed on the hot plate, it is not cold and the dressing leaks on to your food. The refried beans are the best I have had in Charlotte and I suspect they have lard or some other fat in them. Not a problem for me because they are delicious. It is not unusual for someone to stop by the table to check on you. Wish they would run buy one get one lunch special once in a while, we would go more often with coupons.",

And it wasn't even frozen. It was just a cold, watery drink. The taco salad was flavorless. They didn't season the ground beef. They didn't drain the grease. They didn't drain the water from the lettuce. The \"roasted corn\" was just regular corn from a can. My daughter found a very long black hair in her food. No one at our table has black hair. The waitress denied that it was hers, even though she has long black hair. She didn't write down our order and got my husband's order wrong.

There is plenty of parking nearby. The back of the restaurant looks like the front. It's a decent size place with great decor that makes it feel authentic. Sever didn't make any recommendations and spoke very softly despite us asking if she could repeat that and we can't hear you. He tome pitch and volume remained the same. They placed us in an area where larger parties are placed. They have daily specials on the menu. The food was okay. I got the enchiladas suiza. It lacked flavor and spice that I'm use to. The sangria was good I recommend that. The rosarita is  a weak drink so skip it if possible.  At the end of the night people fanned out and our waitress disappeared. My friend asked a gentleman working nearby for a to go bag and you would of thought he spit in his Cheerios. The look on his face was priceless. He appeared so disgusted and needless to say didn't return with a bag. The waitress eventually returned and we got what we needed. The gentleman continued to work his area and didn't look our way. I wouldn't say this is great food or service. Let's keep exploring and see what else charlotte has to offer.",

We ordered our drinks and I decided to wash my hand before I do a deep dive on those chips :)   The bathroom was pretty clean which is how it should be right? Specially for a restaurant. Anyways I came back and we had couple of different types of salsa which was perfect.   The place got packed pretty quickly however our order came fairly quickly which was pretty good on their part. Our food came out good and tasty. Towards the end, manager even came to check on us to make sure we had good experience and I like that.   Overall I had a good experience and the only reason this place didn't get 5 star was the smiling factor on service. On a side note, they could really use beautiful English speaking Latino host. Everywhere else here they have pretty ladies as host and here I think manager was acting as a host.",

They do have some nice choices for lunch specials, which are very reasonably priced.   I am a fan of the Fronterra Burrito which includes rice, black beans, chicken & cheese that is served with a side salad.  Chips & salsa are tasty and plentiful, so remember not to fill up before your entree arrives!",

    "text": "I am still learning my way around Ballantyne.  Just discovered some restaurants across the way, I didn't know we had a Mexican restaurant over there!    SERVICE:  Not so great... My waiter acted like he was paranoid, or on crack. I'd be just about to ask him for something and he'd disappear. He basically zoomed by and didn't ask if I needed anything (when I did).  Also, came behind me, grabbed my glass for a refill like a ghost.  Also, kept the change from a $20- like he just assumed AND he overcharged me $1.05 for my fresh guacamole.    ATMOSPHERE:  Very festive, Mexican cantina looking decor.  Large restaurant you could get lost in.   I was flying solo for lunch around 1pm... The place was a ghost town. No one was at the front to greet me so another guest and I had to hunt someone down.      CLEANLINESS:  I didn't see the bathroom.  That's usually my barometer on how clean the kitchen is. FYI: If the bathroom is dirty, I'm walking out.  The hostess sat me near the kitchen. The restaurant itself was clean, but the floors were really dirty in the kitchen, which was in clear view from my seat.  There was a lemon under a table at the entrance of the kitchen that looked like it had been there since construction, but I give them a pass... just because everything else looked clean.   FOOD: They have a regular and then a gourmet menu, which looks interesting- pineapple and mango stuff... but I like my traditional favorites and it's hard for me to step out.     The menu was missing the typical a la carte items you normally see in Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the Burrito Deluxe because I like the regular old beef burrito with red sauce on top like most Mexican restaurants serve, but I also like a little lettuce, guacamole, and tomatoes, so I normally order a side guacamole salad.  I didn't see guacamole salad on the menu, so the burrito deluxe looked like it would be sort of like that.  I was disappointed that the food wasn't what I expected... I don't like beans and rice in my burrito. There was hardly any beef and basically no red sauce.  Boooo!    The salsa was on the hot side and chunkier than I typically like, but seemed fresh and had a good flavor.  It has chunks of onion and jalapeno. The chips were warm and crispy.  I asked for mild salsa, which looked different from the original salsa they bring.  It was finer and not chunky.  It was luke warm and not the greatest flavor.   They were advertising Guacamole Fresca, so I ordered that. I asked how much and the waitress across the room said $4.95.  A waitress came by and made it fresh before my food came out.  She mashed up avocado (which still had the sticker on it; not a big deal, but come on now!) into a bowl of premixed, fresh ingredients (onion, tomato, cilantro, and I assume salt).  They charged me $6 for it, BTW.  It was the best part of my meal and enough for 2-4 people, so I had it packed up to go.   The busboy walked by as I was putting away the leftover guacomole and was kind enough to ask me if I'd like some chips to-go since my server didn't have the courtesy to ask... and he was off smoking crack somewhere.  LOL.    PRICES: It was a pretty expensive lunch because I ordered the fresh guacamole, but that was the highlight of the lunch.  In general, though, the prices are comparable to any other Mexican restaurant in the area.    FINAL CONCLUSION: All in all, I'd give it another try.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day.  The food showed signs of better things on the menu.",

On another note, this also gives Zapata's points for being kid-friendly... kids eat free on Sundays!  Chips and queso here are really good. And the decor is nice and colorful and not way too tacky (like a lot of \"cantinas\").  Zapata's does have a vegetarian section of their menu, positive points for that... but only 6 options. I definitely gobbled up most of my \"Champinon\" burrito, but it was a little salty and not as fresh as I'd prefer.   I'd most likely go here during work again, but not on my own.",

    "text": "Ouch!  Usually this would be at LEAST a 4-star review from me.  When I worked in Cornelius I used to go to Zapatas a few times a week for what we liked to call \"Mexican Therapy\" lunches.  I was so excited when my (new) boss asked if we wanted to do a late lunch at Zapatas this past week in Ballantyne.  We were seated fast, asked for waters and a chance to look over the menu, given chips and salsa, delivered waters, and were left there for 25 minutes.  One of the women at my table physically got up and got us napkins.  Then about 10-15 minutes later she walked over and asked them to take our order.  It was crazy.  All three of the waiters were sitting in the back (within eye-shot), but just didn't come over to our table.  So we got our food pretty fast and then were brought one check.  We put our cards out-they just sat there.  When one of the guys came over to fill up our waters we asked him to please take the check even though he wasn't our waiter.  Poor thing had no idea what we were asking him to do.  Finally we wrapped everything up and got out of there within 1.5 hours.  I still give this place a 3 stars because I honestly believe that maybe they were just having an off day.  Even my boss, who goes there at least 2 times a week said that this was strange for them.  The food is great--I always get disappointed when Mexican Restaurants don't serve tamales, but it's cheap and usually pretty fast service.  Wish I could've shared better news here!",

Zapatas has completely gone downhill and has now reached the classification of all the other # 14 Mexican type restaurants.  This is not sustainable in this area.  There wasn't a wait tonight, Saturday which you used to have to wait at least 15 minutes especially is Ballantyne.  This tells me that other people have noticed the issues also.  the chips to start were much thicker and overcooked than they should be, the salsa was completely lacking in flavor and the entire \"chips and salsa\" experience kind of sucked.    I ordered the pork carnita tacos.  They now serve the tacos in this metal stand up thingy which is cool, in theory so the tacos don't tip over and dump out all of the stuff inside.  The problem is that the stand up thing is metal and they heat the plate up and besides the plate being piping hot when they serve it the metal stand up thing is like 400 degrees so you can't get to your taco until it cools off about 20 minutes after they set the plate down.  the tacos themselves also were lacking in flavor and were so greasy that I had to let them drip free of that orange color pizza type grease before I could eat them.  Beans and rice were, well, beans and rice. All in all it wasn't a good meal. I would prefer to have them raise their prices and beef up their quality to the level that they had years ago.  Right now it's pretty similar to going to every other Mexican joint and we already have plenty of those.",

Similar to what others have said, there was a little bit of a wait at the hostess stand because there was no one there. Once seated, it took a little while for someone to take my order.  You can just a Mexican restaurant by the chips and salsa. I should have known that food wouldn't be good because the chips and salsa weren't good.  The chips were very bland and the salsa was just hot and soupy. I ordered a combination with one taco, one enchilada, tice and beans.  It was pretty expensive, at least IMO, $11.25.  The taco was pretty good. The enchilada and rice were flavorless.  I didn't try the beans, they were very runny though.  The person that cleared the table, asked if I wanted dessert. The waiter then came and asked if I wanted dessert, then finally came back and asked if I wanted my check. All and all the food wasn't good and I left they're paying almost $20 for a taco, enchilada and a sweet tea. I don't see a reason to go back.",

The staff are also nice and friendly. The place is also beautifully decorated.  The problem occurs with service. Like I said, the staff are nice but they can usually be slow and not come around to your table very often. This is being based off multiple visits, about 10 visits. Sometimes service is great! But 70% of the time food can be slow to come out on non busy times, drinks can take a while to be refilled, and there's been a couple times where processing the check takes a long time.  So they need to work on service. But based off how many times I've said I visited, foods good. When they bring out your chips, ask for some queso dip, it's AWESOME.",

    "text": "This was our first time going, despite having lived right around the corner for a couple years. Was surprised to see how big it was inside. Always thought it was more of a hole in the wall, but it's quite expansive inside. Nice enough decor.  Our server (Chuy) was great, but the bar was slow making our drinks. It wasn't busy, so I was perplexed. I had a beer, practically impossible to screw up, and my partner had the Mojito Mexicano. I hate mojitos, but as a bartender, I knew it was a good drink. Was on the stronger side, too. Which is NEVER a problem!  DO order the guacamole fresca. Our server made it table side, and it was exactly the way I like my guacamole, fresh and creamy. YUM! I'll be back for this reason alone.   We both ordered the Baja Fish Tacos. They didn't look that delicious, but they were pretty damned tasty. Lots of tilapia inside. Usually I have no problem downing a order of three, but had to pack one up. The beans and rice served with it were yummy as well. Everything was piping hot, which is a pet peeve of mine. Points for that.   All in all, I'm excited to return and try some of their other dishes.",

    "text": "Before I get started, I'll admit right out of the gate that Zapata's deserves a 2 1/2 star rating.  But since that isn't available I'll round down.  My review has a lot to do with my past experience and how far I believe they've fallen off.  I lived in Ballantyne for about five years, but moved closer to center city about six years ago.  While I lived in south Charlotte, this was one of my favorite places to frequent.  Huge plates, tons of fresh veggies, everything cooked great.  Well, after visiting this past weekend - boy things have really fallen off.  To be completely fair it is relatively on a par with most other Mexican restaurants.  But I don't pay $18 for a plate at any other Mexican place, and if I did I would want it to be better than Zapata's turned out.  I opted for the steak, shrimp and veggies (okay, I admit that isn't a typical meal at a Mexican restaurant).  Steak was waaay overcooked, as were the shrimp.  The veggies were good, just not as many as I had come to expect.  All in all the meal was just \"eh\".  A big point of frustration for my fiance came when she ordered drinks for our group: two girls and two guys.  When the drinks were brought to us, there were two large glasses (given to the guys) and two small glasses(given to girls).  The bar had ran out of clean dishes and - instead of washing a couple of cups - just made two sizes and charged her regular price for all.  In fairness they did make it right, but who wants to have to go complain about something like that.  All in all, Zapata's is not a terrible restaurant, but for the price I can eat a lot better.  I doubt I'll be back.",

Or who have 5 kids to feed with the purchase of 1 entree on Tuedays (or whatever day that is).  But for those True Meh He Cano cuisine lovers out there, skip Zapata's and come to East Charlotte to party with the authentic places. If you don't want to drive that far, head to Stonecrest and enjoy some Cantina 1511. But don't waste anytime here - you'll leave saying \"Eh... it was alright\" and to be honest, life's too short to eat OK Mexican food.",

We recently placed an order for two \"to go\" and one of the orders was missing. My husband waited for at least a half hour for the other meal.  No, he was not offered a complimentary beverage while waiting. Clearly something has gone amiss here, and they have \"cheapened down\" their ingredients big time. Whtat a disappointment!Stramgely, we were talking the day before to two neighbors who referred to Friday's and \"Zapata's\" night. When we mentioned \"going to Zapata's again Friday\"? she answered \"NO, the food has lost it's quality and the service is lacking. We're finding a new Friday night spot. I told her we'd noticed the food becoming greasy/subpar and hoped it was just a temporary chef, so we went back. I could not eat the meal and drank a Boost instead. My husband  wasn't pleased either. We don't plan to return. . Now if someone could suggest a really good Mexican restaurant in Ballantytne/Pineville, we'd be most appreciative.",
