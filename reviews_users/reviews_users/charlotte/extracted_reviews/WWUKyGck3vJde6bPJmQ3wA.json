Pork ramen  noodles were chewy with a great bite to them broth was neutral and clean taste pork was inedible dried out pathetic. Should have opted for spicy miso and anything other than this pork nonsense. Bathroom clean and parking was free but I'm still staying with Futo Buta in Charlotte until someone takes the crown.",

    "text": "First and foremost, the atmosphere is trendy and hip! I particularly liked the lighting, the sexy bar, and the concrete flooring!   This is another sushi/ramen place; this genre of restaurants seems to be all the rage now! I am neither a sushi fan or a ramen fan, but still wanted to check out Yume. Plus, my friend, Kathleen, suggested that we meet there. I do whatever Kathleen tells me to do!   For me, the menu was a bit limiting.  We were there for lunch, and I was curious to know if they had a more varied dinner menu, but never found out. There was only one thing on the lunch menu that appealed to me and that was the vegan ramen bowl. The bowl came out very quickly after we placed our orders. The service was really good here!  Our bouncy server was efficient and friendly.   There were a lot of different kinds of mushrooms in my bowl. I like mushrooms, but the broth was just a bit too earthy for my taste. I ate every drop of it, so it wasn't objectionable. It just wasn't what I would be anxious to get again.  I would definitely consider taking a sushi loving friend to this restaurant, or someone who likes ramen noodles in a pork belly kind of broth.   One other thing:  as always, I ordered iced tea with my meal.  One sip of this tea had me about ready to gag. The server told me that they did not brew their own tea, but that it came from a syrup. Just yuck.  Yuck. Yuck.  This is the frickin' south and as such, all restaurants should be sensitive to the iced tea drinking NEEDS of their customers!  Come on YUME, brew your own tea, for heaven's sake!  I will come and show you just how easy it is.  Good tea would have made my earthy ramen broth go down just a lot easier!  / This is a trendy restaurant in a trendy part of town. Glad I went.",

She seemed annoyed when I asked to be seated elsewhere, although she did let us sit at a different table. After this small seating episode, we were greeted by Susan, fabulous and personable table attendant. I am not a big \"foodie\" so I was delightfully surprised to see grilled avacado on the appetizer menu. My son, ordered Miso Soup as an appetizer - twice! Both were excellent in flavor and timing. The meals arrived soon after the appetizers. I had the Vegan Ramen and my son ordered the Curry Ramen. Each soup dish was abundantly flavorful, filling and simply good. Altogether an enjoyable experience and I will return.",

    "text": "We came in on a Monday after work because not very many place are open after 9:30-10pm for Asian food. Yelp says they are open until 11 so we figured this would be perfect. We have been wanting to come here anyway.  There was only 2 other couples there who left pretty much when we walked in.  We sat at the bar. Another gal came in and asked if kitchen was open. The bartender said they close kitchen around 10 but bar stays open.  I would personally close it too if no customers. Reason I put this in review is I would hate someone to go here and they decided to shut it down even tho yelp says open to 11.  Bartender was VERY friendly and a nice guy. Of course there was talk between staff about their day and cleaning up blah blah blah that didn't make for the best experience but we were in this business before in the past. I ordered Gyoza and my man got miso soup to start. Came out quick. Decent but not DAMN that was good. I got the coconut curry Ramen and he got the Japanese curry. He LOVED his and it was super spicy. Me.... it was good just not sure I was in the mood. I will def be back because I want the full experience. We didn't have any drinks, it was later and dead. It drives my boyfriend nuts when he can hear the servers talking personally (complaining). We love good food, we love spending money on food and experiences. I saw other reviews of the live crabs so again....we will be back",

The bar was fully stocked and we could see someone cleaning the bar, but no staff member was a \"bartender\".   Seafood Ramen is only available during dinner hours. Sashimi is overpriced. (For example, $4 or $5 for ONE slice of salmon??) Ramen broth had very little flavor and the noodles were a little undercooked.   Whenever we visit ramen shops, we don't have to upgrade our ramen in order to get the tender pork, but here, you do. At every other ramen shop we've visited, tender pork belly was included. On our visit to Yume, the pork included was not tender at all and the (tender) pork belly was an add-on. The pork belly was also not sliced properly, chunky and reminiscent of carnitas :) The  marinated egg, a traditional standout ramen ingredient, was lackluster and inconsistent between two bowls. One egg was hard-boiled, ice cold and wrong. The other egg was nearly raw, very runny and, again, wrong and neither was marinated to the (yellow) center nor sliced in half as I'm accustomed to having. On the other hand, I guess you can't slice a runny egg. The water was quite tasty. Service was \"okay\".   I wanted to visit this place for the longest and was brought here to celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed and will not visit again.",

The one I had included the sauce poured into my rice and I don't like soupy rice. However, it was delicious when I heat it up in the microwave the next day. The flavor of the juice was absorbed into the rice. My hubby loved the spicy miso ramen. He said it was better than the spicy miso ramen at Whole Foods in Waverly off of Providence/485. The glass sodas were a nice touch to the place. Will probably just come here for date night.   Eclectic crowd, great staff, would definitely promote to my friends about this place.",

The meat is not really tender and the egg is not quite there yet...the combination is not really bring out a tasty bowl of ramen...

Try at least one of those. They also have some top quality fish from Japan that is available on occasion.   The restaurant is open, bright and airy. There is a 10-12 seat bar plus an equally sized sushi-bar along with about 20 tables. There is a good selection of wine and beer and saki of course. Our bartender, Chris was very knowledgeable, friendly and steered us to some good plates.  Try the gyoza's, they are clearly home made and very tasty.",

So I finally made it back. The wait wasn't long, I'd say about 10 minutes but that was okay since we were still waiting on the rest of our party to arrive. The gentlemen in the suite was really polite and friendly. He checked up on us a couple of times while we were waiting. The place is small but not too small. Can't go wrong with pork belly so I had to get the Kakuni Bao. The pork just melted in my mouth. I think it had a mayo base that didn't go right in my opinion. My son had the tempura shrimp and veggie. He's not a veggie person so he was a little disappointed that there was only 2 shrimps. I ate his veggies which was light and crispy. We also tried the takoyaki. The squid flakes on top gave it a move fishy taste. It moving from the heat always gets people. I would have liked more or a bigger piece of octopus in it. I love ramen so I had to get that. I got the spicy miso ramen. It had a great pork broth. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The egg was a little too done for me. I like the yolk to be really runny. The pork was thick but I like mines thinly sliced. My son ordered the salmon teriyaki which was put in the same time as all of our order but somehow forgotten so he didn't get his meal until we all were done eating. And to top it off, it was such a small piece of salmon so that left him still hungry. This place is pricy than other places but that's probably because it's towards uptown.",

Came with 3 very tiny tempura shrimp, 3 mussels that claimed they were mussels. Zero meat in them whatsoever. Harris Teeter sells mussels for less then $10 for a bag and they are meaty. And 3 less then dime size clams. I'll pass from here on out. I wish I had taken a pic. I don't eat pork so seems like most great reviews are about the pork dishes.",

    "text": "Our favorite place for sushi and ramen.   The spicy miso ramen is delicious and better than any other ramen in the city. To those who prefer that other ramen place (FB), bye *wave*. So sad to see you go. Not really. Lots of ramen choices for everyone, including vegan. The seafood is another hit with us.  They have a plethora of appetizers that they do a spectacular job with it. Our faves: takoyaki, hamachi n chips, mackerel, poke, gyoza, pork belly buns and more. Did I mention hamachi n chips? These are BOMB. If you like ceviche, you may enjoy these.   Their sushi is amazing, they have an option for you to aburi your nigiri (flame torched) and this really adds another dimension of flavor to your sushi. You have to try it if you are a nigiri lover. We recommend trying the tuna and salmon aburi, especially the belly cuts. YUM. :P   The place is nice and spacious and looks beautiful. As a bonus, you get great views of hipsters riding by on their scooters.",

It was okay, but not super enjoyable because it definitely had very low alcohol content, I suggest getting the beer or a soft drink that you would enjoy more.   For appetizer got the tempura veggies, comes with about 6 pieces, simple crispy. Friend got the fried oyster, said it didn't taste like too much but the texture was amazing.  Main course, recommend getting the ramen, much better than the pork donburi I got.  Dessert was good. Simple mochi ice cream piece.",

    "text": "Sadly, Yume is not very yum-my. I'm sure I'm not the first person to make this joke, but I was pretty underwhelmed by my lunch here.   Since we couldn't get the website to work at all (menu just doesn't load on phone, iPad, desktop, or any other technology), we basically had to rely on Yelp photos and then just go there. The restaurant is cute enough, but we were given two very different menus and were unsure how to proceed. My wife's menu had three additional pages that mine didn't. I'm assuming I accidentally got a dinner menu, but I'm not sure.   We started with the Sakura sushi, which I thought was going to be this beautiful flower thing I had seen online somewhere. It was instead very average and tasted maybe one step above grocery store sushi. My cocktail (some rum concoction) was okay. Glass was given to me half full, or maybe I'll say half empty if I'm feeling pessimistic. Then the ramen came. I had the tonkotsu spicy miso. It wasn't spicy at all. Broth definitely lacked flavor. I had to add chili flakes. The pork was greasy and underwhelming. The noodles were a lot thicker than I've had in most ramen. I finished it, but I wasn't thrilled by any means.   Our waitress was nice when she was around, but she abandoned us for large stretches of our meal.   There was a little kid next to me who also ordered ramen. She leaned over to her dad and said, \"I like Futo Buta better.\" Me too, young foodie. Me too.",

Yume's previous location had about 6-7 tables, so to transition so smoothly to the large location they are at now was awesome to see! We ordered the custom sashimi platter (let the chef know how much you want to spend and then they'll give you what fits in that price range), all of the ramen, and multiple appetizers. Everything was super fresh, including the freshly fried tempura, and delicious!",

Staff was not friendly and server never brought the two appetizers ordered. Hostess area was a mess. TVs in restaurant playing soccer game - a turn off.  On a good tip: sushi rolls were huge and curry pork dish was pretty tasty. Everyone felt the dinner was slow and just blah!  Too many better places to eat in CLT.

We were immediately seated and our server Chris was very nice and polite. We had the octopus hush puppies which was new to me but very delicious. I ordered the seafood ramen which was oh so good. It was definitely fulfilling and honesty I couldn't even finish all of it. My wife enjoyed the black garlic ramen and she finished the entire thing (I don't know where she puts it).

Fish flies in fresh every week from japan and you can TASTE the difference. We ordered nigiri and there was no fish smell whatsoever. Fish was like a soft buttery cloud with a refreshing finish. Wow. Also enjoyed the fatty tuna maki roll, didn't realize there was a little wasabi in them which wasn't mentioned on the menu. Tuna tower had some heat to it also but was very good. Box sushi with tuna and eel was also great. Told my waitress we had a birthday and ordered the green tea cheesecake and she put a candle in it to celebrate. Also recommend spicy miso ramen!Plan to come back and try the wagyu!",

    "text": "So I've dreaded writing this review and it really hurts me to write this but I was expecting so much from this experience. Now I know it was the opening week and I always go in to opening weeks knowing there will be hiccups and that they are perfecting their craft with a live audience but there were a lot of flaws in our visit and a major one was the food.  I've been very excited for the opening of Yume. Following them on social media really hyped me up. I absolutely love San Francisco ramen and to hear that the owners/chefs ran a restaurant in that area and were bringing their talent to the Queen City warmed my heart.   I was sad that they had to push back their opening one day but I knew I would make it in during opening week.   Upon arriving the lobby was packed and the restaurant seemed packed. It was peak dinner time so that was to be expected. My family decided to go and try and with people five people I expected a wait. We were quoted 30/35 minutes and that was kool especially for what we thought was going to be delish ramen. The kids needed to go to the restroom and upon traveling to it I noticed a lot of empty tables. Now I didn't think anything of it because they may not have had the waitstaff to accommodate seating all those tables so I turned a blind eye. When we returned to the lobby there was a small tiff between the wait staff and the hostess about being able to seat the tables. Again opening week turn a blind eye. They are figuring things out.   Once we were seated we were welcomed by our amazing server Li. She was phenomenal. She took great care of us and was very open to our feedback unlike some others (to be discussed later). My sister and I ordered the Fermented Black Garlic Tonkotsu and my nephew and mother ordered the Salt Tonkotsu. We also placed an order togo for my father of the Salt Tonkotsu minus the corn.   The live crabs at the sushi bar kept the kids  very occupied while we waited about 15 minutes for our Ramen to arrive. The Ramen seemed to arrive quicker to the tables than the sushi. Even when we inquired about how long it would take for our food Li informed us that we should be fine because we didn't order any sushi.   Now to the taste.... oh wait there wasn't any. So the broth had absolutely no flavor to it. It had color and looked like any other Tonkotsu Ramen I've had in the past but one big thing was missing was flavor. It tasted like enhanced water, kinda like the La Croix of Ramen broth. We let Li know and she notified the kitchen but to no avail we were told that it basically was just us and our tastebuds. She related that the Fermented Black Garlic was just an enhancement to the Ramen but it didn't enhance. We also told her that our Pork Chashu was very fatty. So fatty to the point that we were taking the small amount of tender lean meat we could find from the fat and putting it to the side. She told us that she was informed that that's the way it's suppose to be. Now I've have a fair amount of ramen in my life and the Pork Chashu has never been that poor of a cut with that much fat nor the broth that flavorless!   So with very crushed dreams we paid our bill and left. I'm not really sure if I'm willing to come back. I read that they will have 14 Ramen options in the future and that does peak my interest but if the broth is the same broth from this visit I'll pass. Plus they didn't even have narutomaki which is my 4 year old niece's favorite.   I gave Yume 2 stars: one for the service and one for the decor. If it was left to the ramen they would get no stars.

Totally forgot to write my review until today! My friend sent me the picture of the raw chicken that was served in her ramen back in March. I thought that I should let all the lovely yelp reviewers see. So basically in March of 2019; we went to dinner and never went back. My friend was served RAW CHICKEN in her ramen (you must see the picture or it just didn't happen jk). I told our server Chris, but he assured us that the chicken was not raw but broiled \"FOR HOURS\". Good thing I become a vegetarian four years ago (save the animals plzzz). After Chris obviously doesn't know what a cooked chicken looks like, we got hold of the manager. She brought out a new chicken but it looked like trash. My friends meal was not discounted or compensated. End story: Yume is trash, just wait in futo buta's line (WORTH IT). I hope Yume closes and a real restaurant will go in its place.",

I found it after a quick Google search, and the other reviews compelled us to give it a go. And boy, am I glad we did! It was a bit difficult to find parking, but we're not from Charlotte and we're probably just Big DumbsTM.  But still, after finding parking and walking up to the building, we were pleasantly surprised to see a rainbow flag sticker on the window. As members of the LGBTQ+ community, we found it nice that they had it on their window.   Anyway, on to the actual visit.  We were seated promptly, and the dining area had a very calm, warm atmosphere. Their menu was easy to understand, and our server was eager to answer any questions we may have had.  My fiance got the tonkatsu ramen, and I the fermented black garlic ramen. We shared a specialty roll as well (can't recall which one- oops) The ramen was amazing! Honestly, the best both I've had. The flavors were all present and mended perfectly. The meat was tender and had very little fat, and the soy sauce egg was cooked to perfection! The bowl size wasn't overwhelmingly large, but had more than enough to have you walking away full. The sushi roll was beautiful and tasted wonderful.  All in all, we will definitely be back. It's a bit pricey compared to a ramen shop we frequent in Greenville, but it won't break the bank. The service was a 10, the food was a 10, everything about it was a solid 10!",

Pace of service was amazing! Sushi chefs were friendly and knowledgeable as well.  These guys are more than willing to do what's needed to meet allergen needs such as GF and dairy free.  Our appetizers were  Edamame tossed with miso  And  Tuna tower made GF   Entree  Fermented black garlic Ramen.  Absolutely delicious! Although I will admit it was tough to eat a whole egg with chop sticks. ;-)   Will definitely be going back to YUME for another visit.   Thanks guys.",

    "text": "They are back! I was a long time visitor when Yume was in Matthews, and wondered when the relocation would finish... here we are in 2018!  The flavors are still there, well seasoned food, done with finesse. Still working out some slight kinks it seems like in the first week with more tables to serve, but no loss of the tastes I remember.  Our table ordered four appetizers (wasabi octopus, chicken skewers, grilled mackerel, and soy sauce salmon) and we all got the garlic ramen. I prefer a stronger garlic flavor, others may not, but the base ramen broth and the soft boiled marinated egg were memorable. From the appetizer selection, I'd skip the chicken skewers, maybe go more seafood based and then just crush a bowl of ramen.  One suggestion... figure out how to make the garbage can not be part of the parking lot! Still 5 stars for the food. It's unfortunate to have to smell the summer garbage going in, but probably worse after having a nice meal.  Go enjoy yourself and splurge a bit. Looking forward to when they have a \"full\" menu after the opening week!",

    "text": "This place just opened up yesterday and by far offers one of the more authentic Japanese sushi restaurants to hit the Charlotte scene.  The elegant decor is soothing yet modern and the vibe is a mix of upbeat yet classy without the need to dine here in a coat and tie or your best Sunday dress.   The sushi chefs put on a show with their knife skills when they make sushi in front of you (we were seated at the bar)  We ordered the the daily special whole Aji (horse mackerel) as it's something you don't normally see, head and all but maaaaaan was it delish!  I've also never had the Kazukono (herring roe) before and was quite surprised at the awesome texture, it was salty and sweet and firm and the mouth feel was like a thousand micro grapes popping against your palate.   The omakase today was superb, so always ask about that and what fish just arrived fresh from Japan. YES!  Some of their fish are flown in from Japan!  The omakase is served with FRESHLY GRATED WASABI, not the usual powdered wasabi you see everywhere.   My wife had the tonkotsu ramen, and just as we remembered the wonderful flavors of ramen from their Original location, their ramen continues to be on point.  The noodles were cooked right, flavors strong but not overpowering and the ramen came out piping hot.   It's still kind of a soft opening but the selection is already impressive with items not normally found in any regular Japanese restaurant.   Ya gotta come in and try it.   I'll let the pictures do the talking now!",

I ordered the vegetable ramen and literally spit up half of it while sitting at my seat. My friend said the seafood ramen was decent, better than Futo Buta.  I will not ever go back. Would give it a 0 stars if I could. After posting this review, the owner contacted me and has tried to disprove my comment of regurgitating my meal. I have no reason to lie or make that up except to share my True experience here. I found it rude that she only took offense and did not ever apologize for the poor experience I had.",

I think Futo Buta has the better vibe and location, while Yume has more options and seating.",

Well they took very good care of us . We got edamame with miso and a tuna tower and they both were amazing and safe for me to eat ! The sushi chef also took special care without me asking he brought me gluten free soy sauce! For our meal we had ramen i was able to substitute rice noodles and when i didn't like the first bowl they offered to make me a different one with no problem . It was also very good . This place is hands down the best for sushi, ramen and fantastic genuine service ! I felt like Chris did in fact want me to have a safe and tasty meal.",

It was date night and also my suggestion since we both love ramen. We got there, and they had valet which is dope. The hostess took us to the back table nearest the restrooms. Cool. No problem. Except for the GNATS. The gnats, as in a squad of them, were hovering around the soy sauce kettle. I went back up to the hostess and requested a different seat. I feel like she was already aware of the gnats and just didnt care about the sanitation). We were then seated in front of the windows but not so far because a gnat floated to our table:-/. Anyway, I ordered the spicy vegan ramen and he had a rice bowl. The \"ramen\" is not ramen  they use rice noodles. Not even to be a noodle snob (but it is what it is), you can taste the difference. Rice noodles are flat, stringy, and dont absorb flavor. Eww. His rice wasnt sticky rice so he didnt finish his bowl. I sent the rice noodles back and had sushi. Ive had better :-(",

Compared to Futo Buto (just around the corner), this place hits the smell and flavor profile of any random ramen shop in the Tokyo/Chiba area; as far as tasting like Tonkotsu in Fukuoka, this place doesn't come anywhere near (but neither does Futo). Overall, the shio and black garlic tonkotsu ramen were bland and lacking in flavor. The spicy miso was very good. Additionally, they were pricy as pork belly does not come standard and is charged as an extra; bringing the total price of each bowl to 20~ USD. Although Futo Buto is \"less\" authentic, I would choose it over Yume.",

Let's start with the ramen... I've eaten ramen all over the world including in Japan many times, and this is hands down the best ramen around. The reason so....simply the broth. They take the time to boil the bones for many hours and the result is a creamy, rich, and delicious flavor. They understand this is the most important aspect of a ramen dish, unlike Futo Buta, who miss this critical step. While the ingredients at Futo Buta are fresh and delicious, the broth is too thin and salty which is a major misstep. Double the hours the bones are boiled and you'll have the perfect ramen, but until then, my go to for ramen is Yume. The fermented black garlic tonkotsu is a showstopper!!!  Now for the sushi...it's amazing! They get their fish directly from Japan and have Japanese sushi chefs who have many years of training in proper preparation. The fish is very fresh and melts in your mouth. The pieces are good size and the chu-toro is out of this world delicious with marbling after marbling. The only downside is the atmosphere and this can improve by upgrading the music selection to modern lounge music and dimming the lights. I am confident the logistics will improve in time. Do yourself a favor and eat here now!",

    "text": "I was in town for work and a coworker and I gave Yume a try after searching for a sushi restaurant. We called ahead asking if they could accommodate a party of two if we were to arrive in about 30 minutes and they said yes. When we arrived we waited around 5 minutes before being seated.  The service was slow. It took awhile for our server to take our order and then all of the tables around us received their order before we did. We had ordered a few sushi rolls and I had ordered miso soup and I think at least 30 minutes went by - if not longer - before the soup came out. I ended up asking a hostess to check in on our order after she walked by our table. We had to ask to have our water refilled and it was just....slow. The excuse was that the kitchen was backed up with the ramen orders but the sushi chefs were right in front of us and not working on ramen.  When the food came, the sushi was good though the soy sauce provided was extremely salty. I realize we could have asked for a low sodium version but at that point we were just hungry. The ramen looked good and like a huge amount (pretty much everyone was taking some home around us) so maybe that's the thing to try there.",

I did like I saw on the YouTube vids and split it in half, followed by adding on some of the onions and seaweed to it. It was great.  The traditional Sushi rolls were great! They truly melted in our mouths.   They funniest part of the experience was : since I rarely carry cash, I had to go atm hunting because the city dedicated to knock out the Internet in the general area.  We did take out and everything was great once we finally got to it later at the house. We can only imagine how great it is if we could have stayed to dine in.",

    "text": "Met a friend here for a final dinner before she moves next week & we weren't impressed. This was both of our first times and we knew it was pricey but it's definitely not worth it at all.  It's a nice size restaurant with nice decor but they have cream chairs that you can see the soy sauce & other food spills on. They have a little happy hour menu from 4p to 6:30p and we ordered the pork belly bao and seaweed & squid salad off of it; both were $5. They were really good, I could come back just for the salad since it's so close to my house. The bao had like a little mayo based sauce on it that was unnecessary because you really couldn't taste it plus the pork had a lot of flavor on its own. For entree we decided to go with the Seafood Ramen to split, Kaze sushi roll, and a few pieces of nigiri. The ramen was like lukewarm and just okay to say the least, not memorable even after a couple hours. The sushi roll was good but nothing special especially for $15.  We also ordered a bottle of sake, we went with the Junmai Ginjo which was under the sparkling section but when it came out it tasted pretty flat but after speaking with our server she let us switch it out for a different one. This time we got the Mio and it was much better. Our server Susan was great-very helpful and made sure we were all go. Overall the food isn't worth the price but the service was good.",

    "text": "Visited their new location in southend for lunch today. Great looking spot. Very modern, good sized bar. Everything's a bit more expensive now with appetizer portions being a bit smaller. Chicken karaage is still delicious. There was no dipping sauce with it. Sushi was decent and sashimi lunch was good. Did not get the rice that it was supposed to come with, but each of us also got ramen so it was enough. One complaint about the ramen was that the soup was warm, and not hot. The toppings are premade, and kept in the fridge prior, I understand that. But they should make an effort to heat up the toppings separately before adding the broth, or the temperature of the soup will cool. The broth was flavorful and noodles cooked perfectly. Eggs and pork were still somewhat cold in the warm broth. If this can be improved this would be one of the best ramen places in charlotte.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came during Queen Feast Restaurant Week. They were offering such an incredible 4-course meal for $35 per person. It really gave us a look into all things they offer at Yume. Since we have never been there, we though this would give us the best in site to what they offer.  We called ahead and made a reservation because we were worried they would be busy. When we arrived we realized they didn't have much parking in the parking lot available but they did have complimentary valet and plenty of street parking. It wasn't too busy, but the parking fills up fast so we went ahead and valeted.   When we sat down, our waitress was very prompt and attentive. It took us a little bit to figure out all we wanted and she was so patient with us. We ended up ordering the first two courses before we decided on our main course and dessert. You first choose a Beverage from the following options: Calpico Non-Carbonated Soft Drink, Calpico Soda, Oolong Tea & Japanese Coffee. We ordered the Oolong Tea which to our surprise came cold and in a can. It had no sugar in it so it wasn't my favorite. I drank it anyway though!  The first two courses were Appetizers from the Kitchen and the Sushi Bar. The options included items like: gyozas, Karaage, Tempura Vegetables, YUME Tuna Tower, YUME Hamachi Crudo, and more. For our Kitchen App, we picked the pork gyozas and Karaage (Chicken Nuggets). The gyozas were delicious, but I wish they had a special sauce to serve with the Karaage. the sauce that was on the side tasted a little like a mayo. Maybe ask for the Katsu Sauce if you order. For the Sushi Bar App, we had the Tuna Tartare and the Tuna Tower. I 100% recommend the Tuna Tower. It is a fried rice cake topped with avocado and spicy tuna. DELICIOUS!  Then it was time for the entree, we both decided to get different items. My Boyfriend got the Tonkotsu \"Pork Broth\" Ramen with Soy. The Ramen had Pork Broth with Pork Chashu, Woodear Mushrooms, Bean Sprouts, Sweet corn, Sesame Seeds, Seaweed, and a boiled egg. The broth tasted a little thick for me, but it was taste. I got the Sauce Chicken Katsu Don. I highly suggest for people who aren't super into asian cuisine. It is fried chicken over rice with sweet corn and a pickled veggie.  For dessert, they have the option between 4 different ice creams: green tea, red bean, black sesame, and ginger. We got the green tea and black sesame. I LOVED BOTH! I would suggest the green tea to people who aren't into super sweet desserts. The Black Sesame Ice Cream was so surprisingly good. It kind of tasted like a coffee ice cream, but not as strong.  It was truly a great choice for restaurant week and I cannot wait to return. Next time I will go back and get the sushi.",

However, I just think that right now, they're overcharging for the quality of food that they're putting out. Not saying it's bad food - because it's not. At all. I just think you can probably find better for a bit cheaper elsewhere.  Pretty much everybody at our table had ramen on their minds, but I wanted to start out with an appetizer - Takoyaki. They did it well - a tiny bit underseasoned, but overall a good execution of a fun dish!  I ordered the coconut curry, as did somebody else in my group, and it arrived quickly (as did everybody else's dish). Unfortunately, it just wasn't up to par with other coconut curries in the area. It was, again, underseasoned and the coconut didn't shine through at all, neither in mouthfeel or flavor. I think I've been ruined by Kung Fu Noodle up in Huntersville. Just wish it was closer! We had excellent service and the rest of the menu looked great, it's just not the cheapest option in the area and the quality didn't really justify the price for me. I'll check it out for other things on the menu, but this won't be my first pick unfortunately!",

I had the cucumber refresher too but the ube sawa is the one , sweet and different, simple presentation and gorgeous purple colors , I don't eat sushi  but my brother say that is very good, very fresh.  Want to avoid the crowds, come around 5 pm , around 6 is kinda crowded!",

    "text": "Finally checked out the new ramen spot in the Gold District.  It had been on my radar for a while, it's just hard to find a time to hit it up and avoid the crowds.  Located at the corner of Summit and Mint St, YUME is a cozy spot.  Though I was just watching people tackle the 4 way stop, flashing red light, that's out there and there were definitely a lot of cringe worthy moments.  I definitely need to not face the street next time I come here.  There's. Small parking lot behind the building that filled up pretty quickly for lunch, however the actual dining room was not really full. I don't know what the parking situation is like on weekends, but I have a guess.  Across the way is Max and Lola's... which is a cool spot, but there's limited parking as well.  I ordered the tonkatzu with spicy miso and it was a solid lunch pleaser.  Also tried the octopus hush puppies and they were amazballs!  Pun intended.  Staff and servers are super friendly here and will take the time out to explain the menu if you have questions.  The kitchen runners also make you feel welcome and make sure you are happy with your dining experience.  The dining room is clean and modern... white with some interesting light fixtures.  There are TVs in the dining room so there's opportunities to watch sports here.  Unfortunately the tv I was facing was on CNN. With the upcoming midterm election, and the four way intersection, I was a nervous wreck after lunch (jk).  The dining room has huge garage doors that would make for an awesome atmosphere when the weather is great.",

Service was slow even with an almost empty restaurant, and while we were there the server we had lost another table's credit card. Wow.   Drinks took a while to be delivered. I had the lemon ginger old fashioned. It was actually quite good. I enjoyed the spin on a classic. Most of their drinks are classic drinks with an Asian twist, which is cool.   We ordered the Kage and Hi sushi rolls and the fermented black garlic ramen to share. The sushi rolls were fine, but nothing to write home about. There are so many good sushi places in town it makes it hard to compete. The ramen was pretty good. I wanted a bit more flavor and seasoning in the broth.   We can walk here from my house, but I may be going elsewhere for sushi and ramen.",

    "text": "Futo's got my heart. I hate to say it but honestly this place is overpriced and it's just aight.   I like my eggs.... poached and my meat.... tender.   The one thing YUME ramen got on Futo ramen is the broth. It's a lot more flavorful. It reminds me of a spot we went to in NYC. The fermented garlic is a flavor I wish Futo would get up on cause it was hittin it. Could have used a tad more salt but it was really good. But that's all I can say for YUME.  The only eggs I like are over medium or poached. I like poached in Ramen cause it adds a little creaminess to the broth. Perhaps the soft-boiled egg is more traditional ramen; and if it is, it's just not my style.  The meat was kinda chewy. I added pork belly and it was extremely fatty. Like no meat at all. I gave it to my husband.  The noodles were underdone IMO.   The only accoutrements I liked was the corn and bean sprouts.  I was feenin' for some ramen, so I was disappointed with this place in that aspect and others.  Let me back track.... I ordered a Lemon Ginger drink. I tasted no lemon or ginger. Really all I tasted was alcohol. It was STRONG-ARMING my tastebuds. But for $14, please believe I drank that sucker down!  The sushi was meh. I should have known too. The only place I should get my sushi is from my beloved Fujo. Godzilla roll has been my sushi since jump. So I don't even know why I bother with other places. I guess I should have known it was going to be plain based on the price ($6). Oh well.  Lesson of the day: Stick to Futo. The texture of noodles have fallen off a bit and the broth could be updated but for the most part I know what I'm getting for the price.",

The sake was excellent and the wait staff is knowledgeable on the type of fish they had at the time. The Ramen was underwhelming, they made a big deal about it but I didn't find it to be that great. But it had a lot of great pork belly in it which I appreciated because most places only put a couple of small pieces. If I was back in Charlotte I'd probably go there again",

We went for an early dinner on Saturday and parking is kind of a pain. They have a small lot, but it was full. They do complementary valet which we ended up doing after we couldn't find a spot.   We were seated right away. We decided to split a sushi roll and went with the Sakura. It was very very good. We were fighting over the last pieces. My friend and I both got the Thai Coconut Curry Ramen and my husband got the Tonkotsu Ramen. I really liked the ramen. The broth was very flavorful. I tried a bite of my husband's which was also good.   The only downside is that our food was pretty slow to come out. It wasn't that big of a deal and the restaurant was fairly crowded.   I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!",

The venue is clean and crisp with plenty of windows on one side and a beautiful sushi bar on the other.    We started our meal with a bottle of sake -- they have a nice selection of options at a variety of price points.  My husband and I both ordered bowls of ramen.  They were flavorful and so very tasty.   The ramen choices were mostly with pork - there was a seafood and a vegetarian option, but all of the other choices (including the one with chicken broth) included pork.  I would love the option to switch out the pork for beef or chicken.    Overall, we had a great meal with terrific service.  Check it out - you won't be disappointed.",

I would advise everyone to make sure the bartender is in. I made the mistake of ordering an old fashion. The bartender was NOT in and I was given something that resembled a half shot with ice.

We got there early, around 5:30, and they were super accommodating to the fact that we needed space for a stroller and also wanted to be \"out of the way\" of others, and it was not a problem for them! They gave us a perfect spot and didn't even seem the least bit upset by our requests (first seating and then a hot cup of water to warm a bottle) which, to me, goes a long way!   We went for sushi this time, and will need to come back to try the ramen. We started with edamame, which has sesame seeds in addition to the salt, and it was a nice touch! Then we ordered a spicy tuna, spicy salmon and a speciality roll with salmon and eel. Everything was delicious- the fish was fresh, the fillings were crisp, and the size of each roll was great. I know it's nothing exciting, but my go-to at every sushi spot is a spicy tuna and I use that as my comparison and I loved how this one was all tuna, just a little cucumber, and the spicy sauce (which was spicy) was mixed in. It wasn't my favorite in Charlotte, but it was darn good!   We will have to come back to try the ramen, but it was a great meal and a wonderful spot for a sushi date night.",

    "text": "Places change. What a shame. I used to really like coming here. I wish I had written a review back then. Then we could juxtapose \"then\" me with \"now\" me. They used to have a very generous chirashi bowl, and lovely fresh amazing fish. Truly.  Now I'll be completely honest- they still do have good quality food. Gotta give credit where credit is due. But because of this, it's as if someone decided that validates halving the portions. The quality is outstanding. I had a chirashi bowl tonight that had beautiful fish. But it was less than half the size of the previous.   I enjoyed all of it- don't get me wrong. I patiently waited as the drinks always took longer than 10 minutes to get to our table. Each time. (Beer- you know- pour it, bring it). And I waited patiently because the drinks were indeed good. I waited for my chirashi bowl. A long time. I figured because it is special. My wife got her meal 15 minutes before mine came. She also waited patiently. Because it looked good, truly, and we were looking forward to the experience of eating TOGETHER.  And when it came (we noticed it had been sitting in the counter for 5 minutes) it came in a breakfast bowl. It was a cute little breakfast bowl, with a nice fancy pattern. But I would eat cornflakes out of this tiny thing. And not many of them.  Then as we were paying the bill, we noticed they had a special on the menu \"mini chirashi bowl\" and saw that the whole thing might have been a misunderstanding. Phew. How funny. How cute!  So we mentioned it, and the manager came and explained clearly that we got the True full chirashi bowl, and that the mini is smaller. About half the size (It must come in a teacup, I imagine?) The manager also went on to explain how we got 10 different varieties of fish ( I counted 6) and 15 pieces (I counted 12 tasty, but SUPER small pieces). The manager went on to say that she knew it is very different from previous, but this was the \"direction they want to go\" with things from now on. She made this point multiple times. It was like she was saying \"this is what we do now\". \"This is how it is\".  So I get it- I sound like \"that guy\". And this review is a waste of my time. Read it- laugh at what a redneck I must be and move on. Whatever. But honestly, check my other reviews. They are usually 5 star, and they are always honest. At the price point we paid, (28 dollars for the \"breakfast\" chirashi bowl) we got, honestly, excellent quality food (truly, I have to say), but VERY little of it, and pretty ordinary to terrible service. And, unfortunately, this is now the third time this has been the case (since the changeover in personnel possibly). We are pretty patient for places we like, and so we have been here too. But you know. We are patient, but not stupid.  We are locals but unfortunately won't be back. There are too many wonderful options here in Charlotte/Wilmore/South End within a mile radius. Sorry. I'm sure their previous chef and staff left for a reason.",

The ramen was good. I got the spicy seafood. It was huge and filling. The broth was savory. The toppings were great and they were very generous with it.   Service-1 star. We got sat right away. We noticed several others getting sat after us. No one came to greet us. We waited over 10 minutes!! The people that got sat after us already had their drinks and ordered and we still didn't even get greeted. Finally, someone from our table went to the hostess stand to tell the hostess. She tells the manager/possibly owner and he immediately gets us drinks. He tells us she will be right with us. She finally does a few minutes later. At this time it was approx 13 minutes! She greets us and seemed very spacey. We ordered our food and drinks. We get our appetizers in a timely matter as well as our food. But she never came back! We literally had to flag her down to get drinks because our drinks were completely empty. So empty we were sucking on ice. She never checked up on us. She literally took our order and gave us one refill of drinks because we asked and gave us our check. She was soooo slow. She didn't even seem that busy.   I wouldn't mind coming here again if we didn't have her as a server. We were there forever when we didn't need to be.",

    "text": "This place lacks, well, basically everything. However, most importantly, consistency. Trust me, a bummer as I am within walking distance. Nothing about this place is worth paying full price - however, they run a pretty good happy hour special (both early and late.)  The vibe is off, mostly because it's generally empty. The appeal is lacking.   The food is good. Decent, however as mentioned above the consistency is off. From ingredients, to sizing and to portion.   I've found this place palpable with the combination of walking distance and happy hour until my last experience. As usual, my dining partner and I walked over a little after six. As we sat down we noticed the menu had changed. We inquired with the server regarding Happy Hour (the only reason as mentioned worth going.) The server said no, it is over, it's \"almost\" 6:30. I re-inquired, as it was not 6:30 yet. The server confirmed that we would not receive happy hour.   As I left I called YUME to confirm as to whether or not they still participate in their Happy Hour in which the host confirmed they did until 6:30 P.M. The server blatantly LIED. Chose to create his own rules. The server mentioned they were the only asian place open (Monday.) We happily went to O-KU  I asked for a manager, and the host sounded confused as to how and why I would ask. My guess, with the lack of professionalism, they don't have a proper manager. I was told the manager was in a meeting and would call back - a week later, no call.   There is a reason this place is poorly rated. Stick with anywhere else.",

We thought Yume was going to satisfy our desire for sushi and ramen that night and that we were going to have a new and good go to place for Asian cuisine.   Unfortunately, we left quite underwhelmed. With the priciness of the menu we were expecting something more. The service was prompt and friendly and had a very chill and relaxed atmosphere. We had no wait time and it was not super busy, which should have been our first red flag for a restaurant in South End on a Friday night.  Now I am not saying that the food was bad at all because it really wasn't! We ordered the Kage sushi rolls, which had shrimp tempura and Spicy salmon and a pork Ramen bowl. It was not terrible but if I am paying $14 for roll of sushi and $14 for a ramen bowl I would expect something a little more flavorful and a little more exciting. It was just \"Eh.\" With so many restaurants in Charlotte I don't think I would waste my time or spend the money to come here again. I think this restaurant has potential and maybe with a change in menu or lowering of their prices this place could be something good, but for now I will stick with other restaurants.",

They offered one beverage with the meal and I got the sake carafe, which was 10 whole ounces of hot sake! I'm not the biggest sake fan and came with an empty stomach so I could only get through maybe a third of it, but it was still a good deal.   For my sushi appetizer, I got yellowtail cerviche which was phenomenal! It was so light and the yellowtail was extremely fresh.   For my kitchen appetizer, I had to go with the pork gyoza, which was pretty standard but very good!   For my main course, I of course went with the pork tonkatsu ramen with black garlic broth. The broth was so smooth and delicious, the egg was slightly sweet and jammy in the center, the noodles were thick and seemed to be homemade. The pork was decent, not the best quality but still very good!   For dessert, I got green tea mochi wrapped ice cream. The mochi was delicious and definitely outshined the ice cream.   All in all this meal was fantastic and I was very glad that I was able to try it all for $35 during restaurant week! Definitely give Yume a shot, even if it's not restaurant week!",

Since it was the 4th of July weekend, the restaurant wasn't too busy, so despite arriving near dinner rush hour at 6:30 pm, we slid right in with no wait.  We were quite hungry, so we ordered several apps, sushi, ramen, and even dessert!   Well, am glad to report everything was back on point to how I perceived this restaurant on my very first visit...Excellent! We enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered...from Miso Soup, Edamame and Shrimp Tempura, to Nigiri and Yume Special Maki Rolls, and above all, the Thai Coconut Curry Ramen. I highly recommend this dish...it's SO Good!! Unlike last time, the presentation was lovely...very Instagram-friendly...and yes, I WILL be posting! :) Also, LOVED their Matcha Green Ice Cream!  The place looked clean and polished, better music selection, no sports TV (personal pet peeve)...and the service was spot on. Our foods were prepared quite quickly, though fully hot and fresh...and our waiter was quite attentive and smooth all throughout. I also got to meet the Owner (Thanks, Rosena!), who was very nice and gracious, in addressing my gripes from our last visit.  I really love their menu, and hope to try one of their Katsu dishes, but I keep getting swayed by their Ramen specialties. Maybe next time?   Anyway, so glad to see that Yume is back on its game!",

Maybe have more fish and ingredients rather than more rice. I think they are better known for their ramen, so I would check that out.   This is a weird requested, but the white chairs are really uncomfortable. If you have the possibility to request the red chairs those our more comfortable. Like I said weird, but if you want to be in a comfy seat the red chairs are better.   If you are in the area check it out.",

It was not spicy at all. When it was served to me I noticed a fishy smell and it tasted fishy.   The service and general vibe of the place was not good. The hostess took forever to seat us when there were plenty of tables open and when we did get sat we were put in a corner table that was freezing cold and dark and dingy. The walls had noticeable scrapes that need to be taken care of if they want to be a nice looking restaurant. Our drinks came out about 10 minutes after we ordered them.",

The parking lot had a valet which was helpful because it seems like the area is still developing some parking areas.   It was half price sake night, so the 3 of us split a bottle of sake. It was plenty for 3 people and delicious. I was really happy to see that they offered sushi wrapped in cucumber instead of rice. It was crunchy and full of really good fatty tuna. Our waitress was extremely quick and we didn't have to wait long for our meals.   Overall it was a fun experience. I would stop in here to try more of their special rolls.",

    "text": "We've been to Yume twice, and both were great experiences, but the second time was for Queen's Feast, so I got to sample more of what they have to offer. This time we had pork gyoza as an appetizer, which was some of the best gyoza I've had in the area. Perfectly steamed and then pan fried, with a fantastic soy based sauce to go along with it. I opted for the tuna and avocado tartare for my second app. This was probably the best part of the meal. The tuna was super fresh and high quality, and the spicy sauce it was served with helped cut through the fatty avocado. So. Freaking. Good. Unfortunately, the only thing that disappoints is the main event. I'm a fiend for Tonkotsu, and Yume's just misses the mark. It's 80% there, but it's lacking the depth of flavor that other Tonkotsu brings to the table. I'm spoiled by Futo Buta in this regard.  One more small note, and this may have just been for Charlotte Restaurant week, but the deserts on offer were different flavors of mochi wrapped ice cream. I'm pretty sure this was the same stuff that you can buy in a box at the store. Our waitress mentioned that they had just gotten \"another box\" of the red bean flavor. Come on Yume, don't phone this stuff in on a $35 meal.  All in all though, a super pleasurable experience. I know a lot of friends who consider this their favorite ramen joint in Charlotte, so definitely check this one out.",

I wanted to note that tonight (6/23/19) there was a group of 6-8 people who were *extremely* belligerent and thus the restaurant was smart in denying them additional beverages (note that at least one of the ladies kept SCREAMING that they drove allllll the way from Concord to go there, and I later overheard that they were so drunk they'd need to take an Uber home). I was truly mortified for the staff, who have always been so kind to us, but they handled the incident with grace and all were relieved when the party went home.  Yume has some of the best sushi I've had in my whole life... tonight I had a special that included fatty tuna and salmon belly nigiri and my husband got two \"surprise\" rolls. He also got scallop nigiri, which was soooo creamy; the sushi chef later told us the scallop came from Japan! I've also had the black garlic ramen and pork katsu curry here -- everything is so delicious. We love their cocktails and various appetizers - get the pork belly bao for sure!! Thank you, Yume, for keepin' it classy and continuing to serve amazing food.",

We did their Omakase, the giant orange clam appetizer, gyozas, the hamachi crudo appetizer and also several pieces of their otoro, chutoro and bluefina tuna nigiri. Everything was so fresh and delicious, awesome quality fish that's become quite rare to find in Charlotte lately.   We will definitely be returning soon, if not regularly.",

The broth doesn't have nearly the depth of flavor as it should.  They charge extra for the traditional pork belly that's supposed to come with ramen. Instead they give you a more lean cut and cheat you out of your money.  The noodles are too thick for my liking but that's just a preference. I definitely won't be back here for the ramen and definitely do NOT recommend this location. There are other places that taken ramen flavor more seriously.",

There was an issue ordering our entrees (we were told that the printer got backed up) and it took forever to get our ramen. The person beside us who was seated after us had received his food, finished his meal and was getting his check before our food was even delivered. By the time our food finally came out, we were ready to leave. We were the only people in the restaurant when we arrived, and it was not that busy to be making all of these mistakes with food orders.

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night with a craving for Sushi & Ramen! This place did NOT disappoint. There was a wait for tables but no wait for the bar, first come first serve.  Our bartender/waiter for that night was DiSean. Since it was our first time there, he gave us a little history about the restaurant which I really appreciated and enjoyed. It was opened up by a husband/wife duo, Tony & Rosena. Originally they were located in Matthews but then relocated to South End. We learned the hard way that most sushi/Japanese restaurants are closed on Monday and Tuesday (how dare they!) in Charlotte since typically those are their slow nights. But not Yume! They decided to stay open every day, super hard workers. He mentioned that \"yume\" meant \"dream\" in Japanese because this was the owners' dream to open up this restaurant.   The restaurant is very clean and welcoming. And the food is awesome! Even the bartender's apron was schnazzy (he had slots for different spoons, tools, etc on his apron that made it super efficient for him to make drinks!). Unfortunately, I was sick and taking medication so I couldn't enjoy his concoctions. I did however opt for a hot water which he offered honey or lemon or lime. Nice additions, honey it is!   The sushi was super fresh, it definitely hit the spot. Consider, craving fulfilled! The tonkatsu ramen was perfection (pork was the best I've had in ramen), I had even told DiSean it might be better than the ramen I've had in NYC!  If I ever get a chance to go back to Charlotte to visit, I'm definitely coming back to this spot again!",

I imagine someone decided to get in on the trendy sushi/ramen train; flavor be damned. Both of us were distracted by huge TVs over our heads the entire time.   We ordered the tuna tower which looked great in other Yelper's photos. It's a fried rice cake with avocado and tuna on top. The major issue is it's sitting in a puddle of soy sauce that the rice soaks up. You have to eat it fast but it's impossible with chopsticks. We also tried the salmon which was overcooked, the ramen which was not flavorful with a hard boiled egg and a sakura sushi roll. The only saving grace was our waitress who was very nice. The food wasn't bad or offensive, we've just had better. $70 not well spent, I'm sorry to say.",

    "text": "Summary: Food = 4 stars, service = 5 stars, prices = 3 stars.  As stated above, service was great - very friendly and very attentive. We went for the Charlotte Restaurant Week (CRW), but after looking over the menu, realized that it wasn't that great of a deal, and you could actually get more off the regular menu for about the same price instead of the limited selection they offered. It was our first time there though, so one of us ordered off the CRW menu and the other ordered off their normal menu. I also ordered a Lychee-tini, and from the CRW menu the Japanese Hot Sake Carafe, both of which were very good. For appetizers, we got the Agedashi Tofu (from the CRW menu), and from the regular menu, the octopus hush puppies and a seaweed salad. The Agedashi Tofu was extremely bland and we didn't even finish it, so big disappointment there. The seaweed salad was very good. The octopus hush puppies were...interesting...but not something I would necessarily order again. For the next course on the CRW menu we got the YUME Crudo with jalapeno & ponzu which was good; four different fish, so nice variety and jalapenos added to it without being too spicy. For our main course, we got the Tonkotsu \"Pork Broth\" Ramen in Shoyu (soy) style from the CRW menu, and the Thai Coconut Curry Ramen from the regular menu. Both were...just ok. The noodles are definitely authentic, but the egg was overdone (and sort of brown) in both of them, and the broth itself was meh. The coconut curry broth was much heavier on the curry side than the coconut side, so not the \"thai style\" flavor combo we were expecting. We also ordered a roll off the regular menu (\"Naomi\") which was AWESOME, but a bit pricey at $15 IMO. Last but not least, the CRW menu offers a single mochi for dessert, and we got the Red Bean one. It was served cold on a plate and was quite good. Just for the record though, if you order the mochi from their regular menu, you get three. So all in all, it was pretty good, but food was hit or miss. It could be because of restaurant week (not all restaurants are able to keep pace during such high demand) so I would be willing to try it again. But I think I'll skip the ramen and stick with sushi in the future.",

    "text": "So my hubby and I went to Yume on my recommendation. It is located near another restaurant that I frequent and since I absolutely adore me some ramen, I had to check it out. They offer complimentary valet which I didn't really understand. I know that the parking situation around that area is far and few between but it was a small lot and since we told her we were dinning at Yume she allowed us to park our own car (there was an empty spot right in front of us). We entered the front door and was greeted by a hostess. The tall hostess was nice and welcoming but the young lady that sits behind the counter barely gave us a hello. Side note**on our way out, she was eating a container of food at the counter. Now I have worked in restaurants and I know this is a big no no. I thought it was really unprofessional. The place looked really clean. We arrived around 6:20 and our server was Chris. He was nice through our entire dinner experience. He made suggestions and even gave us a to go water in a kiddie cup. The appetizer of octopus hush puppies weren't something I would order again. It contained just a small piece of octopus and the rest of this mushy filling. My hubby ordered the seafood ramen spicy. He enjoyed it and said it was really filling. I got the Fermented black garlic ramen. That had a lot of flavor and the broth was awesome. I would come back just for that.",

The salmon and tuna were both very fresh, some of the best I've found in the area. Good lunch special. Wanted to get delivery but the prices are higher on door dash so I chose to pick it up myself. Not sure why the prices differ? But anyways I will def be back when in the area.",

The staff was friendly enough, but not super attentive. They were more interested in having conversations amongst themselves than focusing on the customers. They would answer questions when asked, but not really forthcoming of conversation or help.   The atmosphere is nice. It's a lot smaller than I anticipated. The decor is nice. The sake was good. They have a large variety of drinks to choose from.   I am anxious to try the food, because some of it looked pretty delicious. I will update after I have tried it.",

    "text": "My husband and I tried YUME on the last day of Restaurant Week.  This is a great way to try this restaurant, since their Restaurant Week menu is such a great value, with lots of options to try.  And while we really enjoyed the food, there were a few things that make us not want to return.  We started with the gyoza and Takoyaki (octopus balls).  The gyoza was definitely the better of the two, and it's one of the best I've tried, being thin and crispy, with a delicious filling.  The takoyaki were tasty, but the filling was mostly doughy, with just a couple of bits of octopus.  Next, we had the tuna tower and hamachi crudo.  The tuna tower was absolutely delicious, and my favorite dish of the night.  I loved the rice cake and tangy sauce, and the tuna and avocado were fantastic.  My husband loved his hamachi crudo as well.  For our entrees, I had the Matsu specialty roll, and my husband had the spicy seafood ramen.  The Matsu had tempura shrimp, partially cooked salmon (?), avocado, and lemon slices.  The flavor was good, and this roll was similar to my favorite from Co, but just a tad less flavorful.  My husband said his seafood ramen was a winner, with the perfect amount of spice.  It was more flavorful than Futo Buta's ramen!  For dessert, we both had their green tea ice cream.  It was rich and creamy, and so good!  Our server was very attentive and helpful.  And the Prosecco cocktail special was delicious, with Prosecco, Pome, and lemon.   So, what didn't we like?  The music was absolutely dreadful.  It really ruined our meal.  They were playing this ridiculous pop (think Celine Dion).  Ugh.  Tables were really close together, too.  And their parking lot is very small, with a valet after 5pm.  I HATE valet parking, and there aren't any nearby parking garages, either.   If they'd fix the music, we'd brave the parking situation, but otherwise, I'm not sure we will.",

The server keep apologizing and it is not his fault, overheard our server asked the sushi chef why it takes so long and the sushi chef snapped at him.  There were a total of 3 tables, 1 already finished eating, 1 lady at the bar, and us.  Can't imagine it takes over 30 mins to make one specialty roll.  Also don't see how \"lunch special\" is special.  It is the same price as you would pay for the specialty roll, only extra you get is either miso soup or salad that come with the lunch special.",

Not sure if this was just a fluke but I was a little disappointed. I didn't have a problem with anything else (the soft boiled egg and pork was wonderful, both flavor and texture) and the service was great, but not sure if I'd be as eager to return.",

    "text": "This is a hard review to write....I really, really, really want to like this restaurant. After all I've been waiting nearly a year to try! When I found out about this restaurant they were getting ready to close their Matthews location and move and I have been patiently waiting for their re-opening. Unfortunately, you only get one chance to make a first impression and my first impression is great as far as food goes, but disappointing with everything else.   First, food - we got an order of gyoza and the spicy miso tonkotsu ramen. Gyoza was pan-fried and pretty good. The ramen was great! Creamy broth and a good helping of toppings. I was a little disappointed that there was an upcharge for extra or extra-extra spicy ramen, since the ramen was maaayyyyybe a 2 out of 10 on my spicy scale, but otherwise two thumbs up for the food!  Now the hard part....the service. I will preface this by saying I recognize and appreciate that the wait and kitchen staff was truly working their tails off. That being said are definitely some improvements that could have been made. While waiting to be seated we went to the bar for drinks, only to be told alcoholic drinks were not yet being served. After being seated, it took 10+ minutes to be acknowledged, during which time we perused the menu and chose appetizers and dinner options -- only to be told by our waiter that they were serving a limited menu. This was a bit disappointing as there were only a few available ramen and appetizer options out of the extensive menu. Could have been easily avoided by separately printing their limited \"grand opening\" menu. We ordered the gyoza and ramen and asked the waiter for a recommendation on sushi rolls, but he took our order rather hurriedly and promised he'd be back to take our sushi order. He never did. Then, we waited. And waited, and waited. It took about 45 minutes for our 6-count gyoza to come out. No extra dishes came with it, so we resorted to passing the gyoza dish back and forth between the two of us. 10 or so minutes after the gyoza came out our waiter finally came back to check on us to ask if we were waiting on anything else. Um.....yes.....our dinners? When our ramens finally came, they were served with braised pork belly rather than chashu as was advertised on the menu. I overheard the waiter tell a different table they were out of chashu. Fine, but would have been nice to be given a heads up when we ordered. We had to flag down several people several times to fill our empty water glasses. I get that the waiters were crazy busy. But hostesses/employees who are not seating customers or doing little more than standing around and who catch my eye and notice my empty water glass should at least offer to fill it. All in all, we spent about 90 minutes in the restaurant for 6 pieces of gyoza and 2 bowls of ramen. I don't think our experience was unique. Looking around, it looked like at any given time only 30-40% of the restaurant was eating -- the rest was waiting for their food to arrive. It seems like the problem was overseating. They were more concerned about seating as many people as possible with little thought as to whether the kitchen could keep up with the volume. Since the bar was not serving alcohol, they sat people at the bar and every bar stool was occupied. Our table for 2 was originally 2 tables meant to seat 4, but they pulled the 2 tables apart, leaving only a couple inches of space between us and the table next to us. It was a confusion for the severs too, who kept trying to deliver our neighbor's dishes to us since apparently we both had the same table number (because, again, it was meant to be 2 tables seating 4, but they pulled the tables apart so they could seat 2 parties of 2). The overall experience was cramped and frustrating. Hopefully in the future they will consider their customer's overall experience and wait/turnover time, not just seating as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  Will I be back? You bet! Will it be soon? Probably not. I had high hopes for this restaurant and still do. Hoping they work out their kinks and I can update this review with a stellar rating.",

We were so impressed by the incredible customer service we received, and loved our food!

I can get 2 cups at the local grocery store for about $1.00 and the flavor will be better than what I paid for here.  The restaurant is pricey and the food is not good at all. If anything, go there just to smile and be seen. Don't go there expecting a decent meal.",

    "text": "Worst service. Somewhat of a rough start from the beginning and then it just went down hill from there. We sat at the bar, the bartender had a great personality but questionable service. He didn't replenish our drinks, we wanted to get a couple of bottles of sake and some beers and i guess he \"forgot\"  We ordered appetizers, they were ok...but cold. We didn't say anything so waited for our entree. Both of our ramens were super cold and bland. Mine actually tasted like i was drinking dishwater, it was that bad. While i did make a slightly custom ramen with extra toppings, My ramen was all messed up had 2 bites of it and returned it. Toppings were missing (and know you're getting  charged for the extra toppings) the bartender knew that we didn't like our food and didn't ask us if we wanted anything else or try to resolve this problem. We didn't say anything as we sat there for 15 min without any drinks and the bottle of sake we ordered. Ended up just getting our bill, and realized we were still getting charged for that $17 bowl of ramen we returned and was told \"since you got so many extras we have to charge you for it\" they couldn't and wouldn't take it off my bill...i told him we didn't even get the extras were getting charged for and they still wouldn't take it off. We asked the bartender to get the manager and it was clear that he didn't want to be professional or be a man to resolve this issue. It was like pulling teeth to get the manager out. Finally he came out (Jonathan) and it just went downhill from there. Jonathan i hope you're reading this. Man, you have a lot of learning to do. Never talk to a customer the way you did to us. He said \"well we have to charge you for the mushrooms since he did bring it out after the fact\" the mushrooms were disgusting and cold. If that was the fact then charge us for the $2 mushrooms and take the ramen off, it was disgusting. And he looked at me and said  \"No.  you have to pay for the whole $17 bowl\".  We went there for the first time because of Ashley (the bartender) she was amazing and she made sure our experience and food was as well. So we were very excited to return for a second time, but thank you Jonathan for making it the worst experience and we will NEVER come back!",

The funny thing is that I was actually looking for a different ramen spot I had visited on a previous trip to Charlotte and ended up here by mistake. Well I certainly got lucky as this place is great. Gabby my server was also super helpful and friendly. Check this place out ASAP!",

    "text": "This restaurant is high in cost and low in quality. The salmon sushi I had tasted like it was going bad and the seafood ramen was just terrible. The broth may as well have been ocean water. It tasted disgustingly salty and briney. And I usually love briney tasting things like oysters. The karage chicken was okay but it tasted more like normal fried chicken than japanese karage. The fermented black garlic tonkotsu ramen was decent but, at $16 a bowl, not even close to good enough to justify the price.   Over all, my experience here was very poor. Better versions of almost everything here can be found at different restaurants in town for a less money. I will not be returning.  Edit: I want to say though, they had a very fine service and wait staff. Very friendly and attentive.",

The inside is nice. Not crazy about the decor but that hardly matters when the food is so good. Their ramen is top notch, no complaints about the food at all. I almost didn't want to post this because I don't want this place jammed packed . But I have to say it's probably my favorite place to eat in Charlotte right now.",

The hostesses and servers were wonderful and able to answer all of our questions.  While I've only had their sushi, and a few appetizers, I can say it was one of the best quality sushi that I have had in Charlotte.   We enjoyed the Avocado Bomb and Spring Rolls from their specialty menu as appetizers. We hope that they add these to the regular menu.  We will absolutely be back - very much enjoyed the atmosphere and food.",

It was so weird to have such delicious bites of vegetables, noodles, etc. then when it got to the actual meat of the dish it was so lackluster. The flavor of the meat was not at all complimentary of the flavor of the noodles, broth, etc. It tasted very western (for lack of a better term). I picture every other part of the ramen was artistically crafted by Japanese people who understand the nuance of great ramen, then the pork was thrown in at the end by a 57 year old WASP from Iowa named Annette Anderson. I ended up just picking the pork out and leaving it aside.",

Now, I would have understood this had there been a long wait. There were SEVERAL empty tables available, to the host's surprise my friends showed up within 5 minutes and *shocker* we were sat immediately.   The server came over and we told him it was our first time, he said he would go through the menu with us.  This really meant he was going to speed read through the menu- he was going so fast we had no idea what he was saying and it was impossible to keep up. I felt like I was cramming for a test!   We ordered the grilled avocado as an appetizer- which was AMAZING. I ordered the chicken katsu for my meal. This wasn't anything great, just a few breaded pieces of chicken in a fake curry like base with some rice. Definitely not worth $$. I had also asked for this dish to be \"spicy\" which it was not.   I was even more shocked with I received the bill- 1 appetizer, 1 drink, and 1 main entree came out to be almost $40.00!!  Even more shocking, there was a $1.00 upcharge for asking that the dish be \"spicy\". Are you kidding me?  This is the first time I have ever been charged for asking a dish to be spicy... and it wasn't even spicy.  Also, if there's ever and upcharge the server should ALWAYS inform the customer that it would be an upcharge.  That's just basic customer service.   I had previously heard good things about this place and unfortunately they're not True.  Save your money and go eat somewhere that's actually worth the time.",
