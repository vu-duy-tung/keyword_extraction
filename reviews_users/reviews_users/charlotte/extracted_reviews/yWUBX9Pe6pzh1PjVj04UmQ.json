We usually go here on a Wednesday night when it's bring your own mug night up to 40 oz..  $3 gets you Bud Light, Miller Light, etc.  $5 gets you better bear like Blue Moon and such  $7 is the good stuff.  Their fried pickels are the best I've had so far and the Mama Ricotta burger is my favorite.  The only down side is parking sucks!  It's all street parking with a couple small lots that let you park there after 6pm.  The place is a little small and is always packed.  They have an outside patio that's nice.  Makes you feel bad when all the runners go by and you are chompin on a hamburger.",

The tater tots are freshly fried and crispy, but I'm not a fan of the sauce that comes with them.  The milkshakes are also pretty good.  Parking is kind of a pain in the ass.  If you can't find a spot in the tiny lot, you park on the street... like WAY far down the street.  I would hate to live in this neighborhood with the amount of cars parked there all the time.  However, the food is too delicious for the parking sitch to affect my rating.  Also, pretty much no matter what time you go, you will wait.  It is ALWAYS crowded.  It's also incredibly loud inside, but nice and mellow on the patio.  Be warned, it is a LOT of food.  I have a rather large appetite and I always leave uncomfortably full and go into a food coma shortly thereafter.",

My first trip I was trying to keep it healthy and I built my own salad with a perfectly cooked Buffalo burger on top.  This was a first for me and I highly recomend it for anyone out their who knows they should order a burger(you are at a freakin burger bar) but you just cannot afford the carbs.  My second trip I gave in and ordered the Mama Ricotta's burger cooked medium on wheat(highly touted by my roommate).  This burger comes with fresh mottzerella, tomato, and housemade pesto   and is quite possibly the best burger I have ever had.  I also had the special side of the day which was their Mac-n-cheese with a spoonful of chilli on top.  I was only able to eat three bites of the side but I knew it was something I could enjoy later.  If you want the best and greasiest buger you have ever had, it can be found here!",

    "text": "ok, well I have actually tried this place.  The service was a disaster, but I'll give them a break because I assume they are just getting into the swing of things.  My beer came with my meal at least half an hour after ordering, and my salad was not what I had ordered.  They didn't offer to remake it, but later when I asked him to remake it, it was done rather quickly.  Overall though I was intrigued by the place, and will def. go back to try the burgers, but I think I'll wait a couple weeks so they can work out the kinks.  The salad I had was cheap, but beware they can be quite salty.  I think burgers are def. the way to go here (duh).  The onion strings had good flavor but had to be eaten with a fork because they were so small and crushed.  UPDATE-  I got a takeout burger so that I could try their food without having to deal with the bad service-  Can you believe that the service almost ruined my takeout experience??  They told me the food would be ready in 6 minutes.  I show up 15 minutes later and the food is not ready.  I waited a few more minutes and asked about the food and was basically told to piss off.  30 mins later I had a burger and thirst for blood.  No one apologized.  What assholes (did I mention I recognized a few of them as degenerates from high school?).  Oh, and this was 3:30 on a Monday when there were only a handful of customers (and the burger wasn't anything special).",

However the food is great.  I have been a few times and each time I have tried different burgers.  The most recent visit I had the turkey burger, with tater tots.  My lunch partner had sweet potato fries and a black bean burger.  The burgers have gotten a little smaller...or you get more bun!  Hard to figure out.  But the flavors are amazing!   The sweet potato fries and the tater tots both came with their own dipping sauces.  Both would be great without the sauce...and I could snack on them for days! My next visit....and I will go back....will be after hours or on a weekend lunch to see just how great the burgers are with \"chilled\" 12 ounce beverages!!!  So...Big Daddy...ooops... Bad Daddy...thanks for keeping the menu items and great flavors even though I still have challenges with the name!  I cannot wait to get back there again...and will definitely have a better park and walk strategy in case the lot is full!",

While they do have some interesting options on the menu, it is simple to create your own burger to get exactly what you want (can choose the meat, bun, toppings). They have all of your options laid out in front of you with prices listed.  My favorite is just a burger with jalapenos, jalapeno bacon, ketchup, lettuce on Texas toast (dipped in the Big Daddy Sauce).  Everyone at my table usually has a different side item and they have all been good: tater tots, fries, sweet potato fries, and onion straws.  My girlfriend loves the Cantina 1511 black bean burger (it's ironic since we really didn't like our visit to Cantina 1511).  We had nearly an hour wait around lunch time. To counter the poor service previously mentioned in another review, the hostess was friendly and thanked us for waiting and the server did fine. With all the various toppings and alterations to burgers that we've made, they have always gotten the orders right.   My only complaint would be that some of the tables can put you in pretty tight quarters sitting back to back with other customers.  We'll be back.",

The grease is the reason I don't give this place a five-star review.  The amount of grease on the fried pickles was border-line disgusting - a literal pool of oil is found in the basket it's served in.  Every burger I've ever ordered from here seems to completely saturate the bottom half of the burger bun.  I usually grab a bunch of paper towels (which are found on the table) and towel my food down before I start eating to avoid a giant oily mess.  Wednesday night is a great night to come in -- they have a special where you bring in your own glass (of any size) and they will fill it for a flat rate.  12oz glass?  $3.  60oz glass? $3.

My only complaint is that the place isn't bigger!  As packed as the place stays, it can feel a little claustrophobic in there. Try to get a table at the back or sit outside.  [EDIT]  Just went again last night and had the Western Burger.  It's a buffalo patty with BBQ sauce, delicious onion straws, and cheese.

I went back a second time for lunch and got the Sam-I-Am sandwich which was very, very unique.  I would recommend it as it is a flavor you probably won't experience elsewhere.  I thought \"pesto, egg, on a burger?\" just like you would, but it was really good.  The egg was runny, so if you don't like your egg cooked that way you may want to avoid this or ask for your egg cooked a bit longer.    They have a great atmosphere and it's conveniently located.

I've eaten many a mushroom in my day, but never one that big, meaty, and delicious (and deep frying, of course, is a surefire way to take any vegetable to the next level).  Fries were crispy and delicious, and the service was pretty great, too.  Tends to fill up pretty quickly at lunchtime (as most restaurants on East tend to do), and the parking is minimal, so if you go at 11:30, it's the perfect time.  I wish I could come here more.

This burger was perfectly cooked, had a ton of toppings including 6 total slices of bacon and was a little like writing a bear! Along side it was a bowl of fried tater tots with homemade bacon mayo. I cannot stress enough how many not-up-to-par burger places are out there acting like they have something going on. They are wrong. I am right. Every visit has been a delight. Yes, sometimes with the crowd it can be a little of a wait, but it's worth every minute. My wife was thrilled with her mushroom burger and my kid loved her regular sized bacon cheese burger.

Had the \"Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids\" it was huge and very good. Their desert menu has about 3 items. But after their burger, you honestly should not have space for anything else.  I read a review that said they were expensive. I would say if you are accustomed to eating Whoppers, McDoubles, Jr Bacon Cheeseburgers, and Big Macs that range from $1.50-4.99.... Then to you it will be expensive. But for the quality and size they put on your plate, I would say that they are priced fare.",

The bacon was so thick & taste amazing on its own I almost wanted to just pick it off & eat it by itself. The fries were handcut & the sauce they provide to dip them in reminds me of chickfila sauce which is not a bad thing as chickfila sauce is awesome! Hands down best burger I have ever eaten.",

The first stop was the Best Burger in Charlotte: Bad Daddy's Burger Bar. Now do I think it's the best... not totally. It does have good burgers but I wouldn't say it is the best. They have very interesting combinations of burgers that I wouldn't ever think of putting on a burger but it ended up being good. Their onion rings are HUGE! Definitely something that can be shared. I also love the fact that they offer tater tots. For some reason anytime I see a restaurant serves tater tots, it makes me so excited. They also have a full service bar. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere. It is very casual but the decor is pretty creative. They have cartoon pictures of their burgers so you can see how they build them and what exactly they put on the burgers. The only thing I would watch out for it the way the burger is cooked, when I ordered I got my burger Medium an it was undercooked. So If you like yours a little pink ask for medium well so you know it wont come out as pink as a medium did.",

The prices are reasonable & the service was pretty good although the waitress didn't come back to the table to refill my drink. It was pretty crowded & without some sort of waiting area...you had the option of going outside or stand around the front entrance.     Another issue is the terrible parking! The parking area is so small and too cramped. With the amount of money the business is making...they should invest in a bigger spot with ample parking...just saying .",

The food wasnt great but not once did our waiter check on us and about another 30 mins later I had to ask a random waitress for our bill because our waiter didn't care to take care of us.

Once inside we found out that there was a wait, but she mentioned that there was availability at the bar. We immediately decided to sit at the bar and we were waited on right away. All of the burgers looked great and we both had no complaints over our food whatsoever. Very tasty and loved the fries as well.

    "text": "This family oriented eating spot boasts an industrial feel but includes TVs and a patio to cater to all clientele. Dora here. I think Ernie just got all excited about the diamond plate wainscoting. Reminded him of a fire truck. :) Seriously, folks, Bad Daddy's attracted all ages, and is in a walkable, bikable neighborhood. Be warned though. Parking is tight, and by Saturday at noon, people were lined up outside, waiting to get in.  We started with the Fried Pickles appetizer. These dill pickles were very good; sliced lengthways, fried very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The only thing that would have made these better would be a little less salt. Dora here. Anybody else getting tired of seeing fried pickles on here? Note to Ernie: next time go with a different appetizer!   I chose the Classic Southern Burger, a basic burger topped with chili, American cheese, relish, mustard and slaw and served on a Brioche bun. Basically a Carolina burger except swap the onions with relish. This burger was huge, sloppy and had to be eaten with a fork. The flavors were outstanding and the chili actually had beans. Tater tots were crispy and had an excellent taste. Dora here. There was nothing basic about that burger.  My wife had the Frenchie which is a turkey burger with brie, applewood bacon, grilled apples and garlic mayo served on a Brioche bun. Dora here. I was torn on this one because I really was leaning toward the Mama Ricotta's Burger, just to try it. Doesn't that sound intriguing? Anyway, the Frenchie with the grilled apples won. The bun was soft and fresh, as if they baked it on site, and the cheese literally oozed from the sandwich. Good thing the tables sport a roll of paper towels because you'll need 'em. But, let me tell you, the jalapeno honey mustard and bad daddy sauces on the side were ah-mazing! They jazzed this yummy turkey burger to awesome, but too much of a good thing might leave your tongue on fire.  And get a grip! Check out the size of this burger!  I would rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.  Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

For a restaurant that only has a few large tables the hostesses sit 2 tops at a large 6 top table twice although there are 3 families waiting for 6 tops.  I am a big fan of this place but thr manager is not managing the wait and seat I very well at all.  Food was excellent as usual but the hostess stand needs some major training.

    "text": "COMA: a state of mental or physical sluggishness  As I reflect on my experience at Bad Daddy's Burger Bar today for lunch, one word keeps coming to mind - \"COMA\".  Maybe because I am still feeling somewhat mentally and physically sluggish still some 5 hours later.  But that's probably because the burger I ordered - The Cantina, was simply magnificent, leaving me totally satisfied and full.   As I stated, I ordered the Cantina Burger, my date ordered the Mama Ricatta's Burger.  Both were filled with juicy deliciousness.  I would like to point out a few things specific to my order: I added bacon, guacamole, grilled onions, BBQ sauce, and garlic mayo to my burger.  Also, instead of the veggie burger patty, I changed it to a beef patty - medium rare.  Upon placing my order, i wasn't worried about how it all would come together taste-wise, you probably could out dirt and grass on one of their burgers and it would be great.   I was a little worried how it would all physically stay intact and in some resemblance of a burger. Half-way through my burger I marveled at how it all manged to remained together throughout the massacre that took place this afternoon.   Upon receiving my burger, all I could do was simply stare at it for a few moments, and give my stomach a chance to wrap its lining around what it was going to have to digest in the next few moments.  Upon taking a few pics for all my yelp-peeps, I placed the sandwich together and dug right in.  As for the actual taste of the burger, as I stated it was juicy, not overcooked or dry.  The beef patty tasted close to something you would get at a cookout in the backyard.  A generous helping of cheese, veggies and condiments accompanied the burger as well.  I like that they don't put the burger together for you, so you can take off, or put on anything you want (that's what she said, lol).  Upon getting about half-through my burger, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the bun held up with all the extras I had on it.  I ordered fries with my burger which were awesome and everything you could want hand-cut fries to be.  My date ordered the tater tots which she loved.  They were savory indeed, and both tasted even better when dipped in the signature Bad Daddy's sauce.  Burger = Awesome. Fries = Amazing.  Service = Spectacular.  Feeling Afterwards = Coma.",

I was also a bit put off that they use canned jalapeno ..I feel like peppers are pretty cheap and the canned ones were just mushy, unsightly and not spicy enough. My fries tasted good but weren't crispy at all so I would get something else next time.    Our server though friendly enough didn't bring out our meal, any extra's we needed, or even the correct side (they brought out the wrong side for my boyfriend). He just wasn't all that present.   Overall the food and service were just ok. Sure id go back but it wasn't as fabulous as I last remembered unfortunately so it won't be a top choice for me.",

I'm not big on beef so I appreciate the options for turkey, chicken, and veggie. My favorite burger here is the Mama Ricotta's with a turkey patty. Their sweet potato fries are among the best I've ever had.  On the downside, there's not a lot of parking at this location. During peak times, you could be circling around for a few laps.",

But, overwhelmed with the dozens of options for condiments, toppings, etc., I found myself wishing there more crazy concoctions on the menu. When it comes to things like burgers and pizza, I play it pretty safe when it comes to choosing toppings.   Still, even the boring burger (with bacon, lettuce, onion, mayo, ketchup) I concocted myself was pretty good. The most memorable part of the meal though were the tater tops I chose as my side. They were really crispy and perfect.   When I went there for dinner, there was a big NFL game on TV. All eyes were locked on the TV screens. So if you're looking for a more elegant dinner, well, a place called BIg Daddy's is probably not the right pick.",

We always choose to sit outside on the patio. It is covered, heated, and equipped with ceiling fans, perfect for any weather conditions! This place is always busy no matter what time of day we stop by, but the wait is never unbearable. And they utilize the No Wait app which texts you when your table is ready. You can even \"get in line' on your way to the restaurant.  I prefer to build my own burger and even tried it with the fried egg on top. While it sounds a little out there, it was AHH-MAZING! Totally recommend the banana pudding! I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm not a fan of the french fries. They always seem to be a bit on the soggy, underdone side. I would opt for the tater tots next time around.",

I eat gluten free as much as I can and eat a vegetarian diet! But let me give you all a sigh of relief for that inevitable \"Where do you want to eat?\" , \" I dunno you decide, you're the one with the restrictions\" battle: Bad Daddy's!!   Bad Daddy's has it all! Vegetarian options, healthy build your own salad options with a huge selection to load on top, GF buns, even GF beer options (you can ask for GF friendly menu!), and regular burgers for meat eaters.   They have a great black bean burger--The Cantina burger (grilled)--which is what I always order. It is flavorful and fresh--never tastes frozen-- thank goodness!! Nothing more frustrating than going to pay for a black bean burger that you could have pulled out of your freezer, am I right? This is layered with lots of goodness including cheeses, chiles, chipotle and my wonderful obsession: avocado. Between the side it comes with and the side salad that I always build to go with my meal, I leave stuffed and not feeling a lack of any nutrients.   The staff has always been on top of it every time we have come in. They are friendly, quick to care for you and they keep up with the restaurant no mater how busy it is. Each time we have dined here we have had managers come out to ensure the meal was satisfactory. Each time it has been!   Be warned on weekends you will wait but there are two ways to do it: place yourself on the waitlist ahead of arriving via NoWait (via your Yelp app!) or get there and wait double the time without doing it. You'll get glares from those who didn't place their name ahead of time, but it's cool, you still played fair! So go on and sit down on that awesome patio and enjoy your beer and meal that can please the whole group. ;)",

The gentleman behind the bar saw that or son was getting antsy waiting on food, so he offered us some soft serve vanilla ice cream. It was good, but not as good as their burger or chicken sandwich. Absolutely enjoyed our to go order when we made it home. The portions were big and the prices are very reasonable. Will definitely be back.",

I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon during peak lunch time (1:30 p.m.) and it was jam packed. The parking lot was and is a tiny lot that requires a spatial logistics degree to fully understand how to get in and get out without dinging anyone's car.  This is all to say how thankful I was that I was picking up my order to instead of sitting down. I had placed my order for the 'cue the chicken salad. Yes, I chose a salad from a burger place. The wait for pick-up was not long and I was pleasantly surprised at the very generous portion size. Although I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised since it did run me $11. The salad was very filling and packed with flavor. I really liked how the chicken was pulled, shredded chicken instead of the very non-realistic chicken cubes that can be found in salads at most restaurants.    I was also surprised at the friendly, courteous service at the take-out counter. Normally, wait staff can rush you and in out or just flat-out ignore you when picking up. Glad to say that was not the case on a busy Saturday.",

So after my last experience at BDBB and some offline chats with the owner I decided to give them another chance......and this place rocks the tater tots, so.............off we went.  Being a Wednesday night around 10pm it was slow and we sat at the bar.....again.  We ordered our drinks and a little side of the TTs.  Next to us was a gentleman that had a plastic tupperware (or what looked like it) jug half full with beer..............hmmm....so we inquired and realized Wednesday was mug night....bring in any mug and get it filled for $4!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wow........working with numbers and realizing how big of a mug you could bring in...............Now this place understands what a recession is all about...............a good deal!  The food arrived and everything was tasty.  No issues this time.................but....and you knew there had to be a but...........the waiter stand that is where I saw the horror last time is right beside the mens bathroom, so when I went in I literally had to raise my right arm to misse the mutliple pitchers of Tea and water that were stacked on that surface...........I know the space is small....and I'm not trying to bust anyone's b*lls, but personally I'd move that station somewhere else if possible, though it may not be due to the current configuration.  So 3 stars are good for now...I'll come back again soon and if they continue to deliver, I'll continue to up the stars.....heck I'd do it just for the tater tots!  *wink*.",

I usually order pick up at the Ballantyne location, but I called this location on accident to order one time. A girl answered the phone and when I told her I wanted to place a to go order I was put on hold. When another server answered she barely gave me time to say my order and rushed me through the order, not friendly at all. At the end of the order she stated it was the East Blvd location and before I could respond (realizing I had the wrong location), she hung up. So I called back to be polite and cancel my order and the girl on the phone was very rude and snapped back at me \"that's why I told you it was the east Blvd location\". It took everything in me not to be rude back but instead I hung up. I have been serving for over two and a half years and I have never spoken to a customer that way. Very disappointing and rude.   Tips of service need to be brushed up on.  Poor customer service",

Seriously, go try it right now. It's amazing.   Only con was the parking. I went on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30 so that might be a super busy time, but it took a while to find a place to park.

I had mine topped with slaw, jalapenos, grilled onions and some of their mayo.. it was amazing! A bit of a mess to eat but I didn't mind at all. I had the fries as my side and also had some of my mother in laws potato chips and I think I liked the fries better, so good!

Second time we were there i tried the Mama Ricotta's burger - well it was only better than Sam I Am.  The fresh mozzarella with the juicy burger and a thick cut of tomato slice just was a perfect combination of all things nice.  Sides of tater tots and cloeslaw - just to die for.  but this time my wife choose Sam I Am (of course my strong influence made her choose lol) .

Pro: - You will see God when you eat those fried pickles - Service is great. Attentive but not in your face  - Beer is cold and bubbly - Burger is huge - Lot of options and you can even create your own if you don't see one you like.  - Family friendly - Seating both inside and outside - They support local breweries. A lot of the beers on tap were from Charlotte breweries - Delicious  Con: - Biggest one and why it's 3 stars instead of 4: Maybe it was the burger being \"Medium\" but my stomach really did not agree with me later in the day - It's greasy (could be a pro depending on how you look at it) and I'm willing to say with 90% certainty unhealthy for you - Homemade potato chips aren't anything to write home about  I'd go back again, but I think I'll ask for my burger to be cooked a little more well-done.",

Go early and avoid the rush, unless you drive a SmartCar.  The service was really good.  This was our second time at BD and the service has been great both times, attentive without being overbearing.  Our waiter obviously knew the menu and answered all our questions.    The food was definitely hit or miss. As one would expect, the burger was the star of the show.  Fresh ground from a blend of chuck, hanger steak, and brisket, it tasted fresh, clean, flavorful and had just the right amount of fat.  Both of ours were cooked perfectly. The bun was good and they have a nice array of toppings.  I had the southern burger with slaw and chili.  The chili was nice and fresh with a nice, almost too much, spiciness.  The sides disappointed.  Fries were very hot but limp.  This is always a problem with fresh cut, cooked once, fries.  We asked that ours be refried to crisp them up but they just brought us another order.  If you want great, piping hot, crisp fries, go somewhere else that knows how to do the blanch and then crisp, two fry method. Tater tots were tasty but cool to the touch upon arriving at our table. The lettuce was a little limp, but the pickle was really good and I liked the Bad Daddy sauce but it was a little too spicy for the wife.  No room for dessert but I have heard good things.  Its a good place to go to hang out and have a burger but for me, more of a spur-of-the-moment place than an actual destination.",

    "text": "There are a few things you should know before reading this review: 1. My family is fanatical about milkshakes. 2. My brother lives in Charlotte. And 3. Because of the aforementioned, during a recent family visit, he took us to Bad Daddy's for lunch.  So the most important thing to take away from this review? The milkshake was excellent. I had Cookies and Cream (or \"Oreo,\" if you prefer) and even without whipped cream and a cherry, it knocked my socks off.  They also offer \"adult\" milkshakes, all of which sounded wonderful. Being a family affair on a Saturday afternoon I did not partake, and so I cannot fully attest to their awesomeness, but how can you really go wrong with alcohol AND a milkshake??   My boyfriend and I split the Cantina Burger (black bean burger with green chiles, avocado and cheese) and the Western Burger (bison burger, Monterey Jack, fried onions and BBQ), and both were excellent. Likewise, we split the sweet potato fries and the fried onions - again, both excellent. Furthermore, my family split an appetizer of fried pickles (yum), and I stole some of my Dad's Truffle Parmesan fries (super yum).    AND! You can make your own burger or your own salad. There were so many delicious options on the menu that I didn't do this, although I love to \"build my own\" so it was hard to pass up.   It was expensive - my Dad didn't have an entree, only two of us had a soda and we split a few of the milkshakes, and the bill was still $100 plus for 6 people. Ok, so now that I'm doing the math that's +/-$16 per person, so it's not outrageous. Oh, and the wait staff were excellent. Accommodating, pleasant, efficient.  It was a late lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was not overly crowded - a little loud inside, but we ate outside and it was very pleasant. Ultimately, I would love to go back next time we're in the area.",

Two 5 ounce ground beef & bacon patties with lettuce, tomato, buttermilk fried bacon, horseradish mayo and English cheddar cheese. Everything about this burger is over the top... double cheese, double bacon, and double beef. Burgers that are trying to be intimidating have a reputation for being merely average. However, the Bad Ass Burger lives up to its name and packs a load of flavor. Juicy beef, crispy + flavorful bacon, creamy cheese, and flavorful sauce make this burger a treat for the taste buds. Despite being a monster burger it was reasonable to handle and I did not feel \"too full\" after finishing it. Bad Daddy's might just have the best burgers in Charlotte.",

But the thing that gets me is that no matter what, my bun always comes out soggy, as in no matter what I order the bun is very damp by the time I start eating it.  And my other big peeve is that why do you continue to ask my how I want my burger cooked if it is always going to come out pretty much well done and nowhere near the medium rare I ordered.  But the service is always good, and the tots are always good.  I do like these new (to me) parmesan truffle fries I had recently, because I am a big fan of very thin french fries, but they could have been a bit crispier.  Prices are pretty reasonable and they always seem to have drink specials and a sandwich of the day, so that's cool.",

    "text": "You have to be strategic about when you go or not mind waiting in a parking lot for at least an hour - but it's worth it. There is limited parking and it is a small location, which is the case for most restaurants on this street. There is indoor and covered/enclosed outdoor seating. Despite the small space, you don't feel cramped once you're seated. If you're going with a group of 6 or more, try to get a table outside. If you enjoy drinks, check out their weekly features before you head out (like Mug Night on Wednesdays - bring your own mug up to 40 oz and get beers for $4-$6). You can build your own burger or order one of their custom creations. As an added treat, they have both regular and adult (spiked) milkshakes.  Food: they have many different types of patties and buns to choose from, I especially enjoy the bacon beef patty. I was disappointed in the buttermilk battered bacon - too much breading for a regular bacon slice. Still, their tots are delicious, their burgers are very tasty, and their milkshakes are just the right way to top it off. The grasshopper milkshake was a bit disappointing but the Snickers milkshake is very tasty.   Like most burger places, there are plenty of tvs to keep you up to date on news and sports. There is a bar but it's a tight fit against the tables. If you need extra parking, check the lot to the left of the shop, there is a road/parking area that cuts around the neighboring business and you can sometimes score a spot there without having to drive further away.",

    "text": "Burger #190: In Good Company  Thank god I was surrounded by health care professionals when I ate that burger. With a 99% chance of a heart attack, they would have had only a few minutes to prep me for an organ donation after my cardiac death. Lucky for me, that burger didn't kill me and I was able to conquer it.   When out with clients, I typically try not to do anything too \"Eli\" like. But when the menu said \"Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids\" and promised six strips of bacon with bacon salt and baconnaise, I couldn't help myself. Since I was already going to hell for ordering that meaty death on a plate, I upped the ante by adding a fried egg to the gluttonous pile.   Behold; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yWUBX9Pe6pzh1PjVj04UmQ?select=g17yyWNzeNH8tx3llO2xZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yWUB...</a>  It was everything I had hoped for; meaty, rich, baconny, juicy, packed with flavor, and overly sinful. The six strips of bacon all melded together into a rich decadent topping that was only enhanced by the runny egg yolk. The mild jack cheese did its part by adding a smooth texture and another fatty element to the mix. The bun was perfect; unobtrusive and sturdy enough to withstand the burger's might. The only thing keeping the burger from perfection was that it came a tad overcooked, other than that it was great.   The coup de gras (pun intended) were the tater tots. They were some of the best I've ever had. Crisp, salty, and delicious. They were just what I needed to help wash down the insanity that was my burger.",

As soon as I read the USA Today Zagat article last week stating that Bad Daddy's was selected as one of the Top 25 burger joints in America I hit the place for lunch to see what all the fuss was about.  1. Service is very attentive but not overbearing... other places should learn from this chain.  2. While the place was packed the noise was tolerable...that can be an issue for many places.  3. After hearing that I was a Big Daddy virgin they gave me a free banana-pudding dessert... great stuff but I was already way full from a great lunch.  4. Last, BUT NOT LEAST, the burger, bun, condiments were very delicious. Being lazy I just ordered the day's special which included some beer cheese and other cool stuff... sloppy but way delicious. The sweet tater fries were just OK if not a tad limp... but the seasoning on them is tasty.  Oops... forgot... parking sucks at this location... plan on parking NEAR the restaurant not next to it...",

And you don't even need to take my word for it--a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur I met in California, upon hearing that I was from Charlotte, instantly inquired about Bid Daddy's Burgers. Talk about a national reputation!  The place a bit small, so be prepared for a possible wait and as others have mentioned, it can be noisy in there. As a tip, just sit at the bar if it is available.   I had to get the bad ass burger, based not only on name but also on the inclusion of buttermilk fried bacon. Yes, you heard me right. What is buttermilk fried bacon? Breaded bacon fried to crispy perfection. It is better than it sounds.  My girlfriend got a plain old burger and she wasn't that impressed. Indeed, it lacked much flavor in general. So, the take home here is to go wild and get some of the crazy stuff that while logically shouldn't be in a burger, makes it simply delicious.  They lost a star because 1) could get their specialty fries with the burger (really?!) and 2) my big ass burger came out missing one of its two pattys. How can you mess that up?",

It was so big I had to take 2 of the pieces of bacon off the burger just to eat it. They should just served the bacon as an appetizer. The tater tots were good as always. Overall we had a great experience. It was made even better when the newest Charlotte Hornet, Frank \"the tank\" Kaminsky, was seated right next to us.

We shared a chocolate milkshake, their milkshakes are a MUST!!!  Some people ask about where can you get rare hamburgers, they take a temp when you order.  Big Daddy's gets a three tot rating.  They have french fries cooked in duck fat on Thursday, Friday & Saturday, I have never had them, but I hear it's a treat.  It seems like all my visits are never on the weekend.

Their waiters are chipper and help you through the menu. I got the one and only veggie burger as is and it was delicious. It came with some chipotle sauce that was one of the best I've ever had. I made my own side salad which was forgettable, but the sweet potato fries were the best I've had in Charlotte so far. Perfect crispiness. The veggie burger itself was hearty and flavorful. Next time we'll definitely stick around for the boozy milkshakes. Can't wait to go back!",

On this occasion, my husband and I split the mushroom burger. For our side, we got a small portion of the asian salad. The burger was fantastic! The truffle aioli on it was killer and made the burger. The dressing on the salad was equally as tasty. My sister in law got tater tots as her side and they were really good!  Good service and great burgers. Excellent combo.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is quaint but very comfortable and inviting. That alone would make me come by again in the future on a lunch break. The parking is very minimal though, so be prepared to have to park down the street if you don't snag a one of the few lot-spots.   We got home made potato chips with the French onion dip to start. The dip was very delicious but the potato chips were a little thinner cut than I'd like and extremely crispy, which some people may enjoy. Our lunches were the Texican Chicken Salad, the Chicken Club with home made fries (best side imo), and the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich with the house slaw. All of our meals were good, though the house slaw was our least favorite side.   I would definitely recommend trying Daddy's Burger Bar. The service is friendly and fast, the food is good, and the ambiance is quite ideal.",

    "text": "I wouldn't even know where to begin! I came to Bad Daddy's in a Tuesday afternoon, where it wasn't too busy. This was the second time at this location, probably the sixth time to a Bad Daddy's overall, but the first time I've left a review! Each and every time, I've had an excellent meal and excellent service; however, this experience was so good, I had to mention it!  I came with my boyfriend. I got the BD's All American Burger with fries, and he got the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with cole slaw. My burger was delicious, cooked just as I asked, and the fries were fantastic! I didn't like them as much as the chips, but definitely still a wonderful choice. Our waitress also gave me a cup of spicy garlic ketchup after I inquired about it, as well as a cup of Bad Daddy's sauce. Both of these were OUTSTANDING! I will most definitely be putting Bad Daddy's sauce on my burger next time! My boyfriend loved his burger! He's not a fan of sweet cole slaw, but it still wasn't bad. I would definitely recommend getting the chips, because those are to die for!   For dessert, we decided to split the Chunky Elvis Shake. I was fairly trepidatious at first (as the $5.50 price tag seemed a little high for a milkshake), but when she brought it out, I saw why! This milkshake was gigantic, and she was even kind enough to bring out the extra bit that wouldn't fit in the glass! This shake has peanut butter, banana, Ghirardelli chocolate sauce, and walnuts. I love peanut butter, but I get pretty picky when banana and nuts are involved (some places overdo the banana flavor), but this milkshake was outstanding! I am so glad we split one, because I would never be able to drink a whole one.   Kerri was our waitress, and she was WONDERFUL! Super sweet, incredibly empathetic, she was overall an amazing server. I would come back 100% for just her, if the food was subpar; but luckily, the food was amazing! She asked all the right questions, was quick and effective with our food, and checked in multiple times! She made great recommendations, and walked us through all of the answers to our questions. When I asked her about the option to add peanut butter in the \"build your own burger\" section, she told us a great story about orders that included peanut butter in the past! She was very unique, had a great sense of humor!  All in all, the picture I attached that's on the wall sums up my experience very well!",

A two 5oz ground beef & bacon patties with lettuce, tomato, buttermilk fried bacon, horseradish mayo, and an artisanal white cheddar cheese. Omg. I literally almost pass out. It was sooo good and juicy. Couple other times I ordered just the cheeseburger. Than recently I ordered the Frenchie, which is a turkey burger w.brie and apples.

    "text": "I really wish I could give this place 5 stars.  The food was absolutely outstanding.  However, our service definitely needed a whole lot of work.  My partner and I wandered in here around 8:00 on a Sunday, which I suppose is not a prime time for burger eating, but I had tried to visit twice before when I was too impatient to fight for parking and wait.  Luckily, we had no wait and got right into the place.    We decided to skip appetizers because we figure we would have more food than we could possible ever want to eat.  I ordered the PB&J shake - OMG, this was probably one of the best shakes I have ever eaten.  I could almost swear they put crack in it, or some other equally-addicting drug.  My partner ordered the Bad Ass Burger, which has so much junk on it I won't list it here.  However, the big thing to note is that it had buttermilk-fried bacon on it, and lots of bacon stuffed in the burger itself.  I guess that saying that everything is better fried must be True, because that bacon was SOOOOOO awesome.  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, which I could swear had nearly a pound of bacon on it (half of which had tasty jalapeno bacon).  Both burgers were absolutely delicious, and their sides were pretty good as well (even though neither of us ate too much of them).  We finished our burgers, but my stomach hated me for it.  Despite the good food, our service was awful.  I am not a picky service person, and I don't expect the server to come by and attend to my every need.  However, we waited almost 45 minutes for our food, during which time our waitress pretty much ignored us entirely.  We saw her once after our food got delivered, but she did not stop by again.  We waited almost 20 minutes after we finished eating before we finally went up to the counter to ask for our check.  I looked around to see if she had left, but she was in the back working on prep work.  Really, she couldn't come out and at least bring us our check?  Very, very aggravating.  I have no doubt that I will try it again at a different time on a different night.  Truly, their food is really tasty, reasonably priced, and quite plentiful.  Hopefully the bad service was just a one-off.",

    "text": "So after having a not so stellar experience our first time visiting this establishment three years ago, we finally decided to give Bad Daddy's another try. This was after literally all of our friends telling us how fantastic the place can be. So we headed to BD last night around 7pm. The tables were all full but we only had to wait five minutes. Parking is a bit of a mess, so keep that in mind when heading in to eat. The lot is very small, but there is street parking and a lot across the street that you can park in after 6pm.   We decided to forgo appetizers for a cookies and cream spiked milkshake, which was unbelievably good (apparently they make the ice cream in-house). If you are of age, I definitely recommend partaking in one of those beauties. I ordered the Frenchie, which is a turkey burger with brie, apple slices and bacon. I added avocado and passed on the garlic mayo. And be sure to get the sweet potato fries with the chipotle ranch. Best in town.   You may want to pass on dessert - I'd recommend a spiked milk shake instead. We found the banana pudding to be too sweet (which is a big deal for me to say as I have a crazy sweet tooth) and the brownie sundae was not good at all - I ate the homemade ice cream but the brownie was hard as a rock and tasted like something that came out of a wrapper.   Did I mention the spiked milkshake? I didn't? Well definitely get one of those; it's a party in your mouth. Yummers.",

I told the hostess who just laughed at me, and then I told the waitress. She did tell the manager and he came to my table.  When I pointed the customer out his comment was, \"she looks like a respectable person.\" Then he offered me a milkshake and I am allergic to milk. Then he offered an appetizer.  He never offered me medical help. I went to the ER and I have a fracture. Now the area is swollen, black and blue. The manager never came back to see if I was still hurting.",

My burger with bacon was smaller than I expected. But in these days of over-sized expensive portions it was probably just right.  With a side of sweet potato fries I was definitely full and for two people (without alcohol) our tab was roughly twenty bucks.    I don't find their tall tables and bar chairs very comfortable, which is the majority of their seating.  However they do have booths if you're willing to wait.  The bar area itself is limited.  But all-in-all it's a cool space and I'll be back on a weekend to see what's happening.    Update: Been several times and the burgers are consistently good.  They have a new cocktail menu.  The music selection is somewhat random, top forty one day and edgy alternative the next.  But I think they're working out the kinks and are quickly becoming a neighborhood icon.  The downside is that now it's always crowded and quickly turning into a see and be seen atmosphere.  If you're looking for a relaxing burger this isn't really it anymore...",

    "text": "Bad Daddy's Burger Bar has become a Dilworth mainstay and operates two other locations in Ballantyne and in Birkdale. Prior to becoming Bad Daddy's (formerly Big Daddy's) this location was one of the cursed spots on East Boulevard that just could not seem to make it. Now the restaurant fills up early, with lines forming and families, couples and singles alike flock for the signature burgers and salads.  Our first time actually dining in (we've ordered takeout several times) we enjoyed a fine meal and decent service. The noise level is higher than I'd like, however, so maybe takeout - or the patio in cooler weather - is more my speed. The Daddy's nachos were enjoyed by all - a hefty portion with chili, black beans, guacamole, queso, sour cream and more. I enjoyed the Asian salad and a bite of the Sam I Am burger - beef burger topped with American cheese, a fried egg, rosemary ham and pesto sauce. There are several alternatives for non-burger fans, which is nice: several chopped salads including a Greek and the Asian Salad (below) ; you can also build your own salad or your own burger and chicken, tuna, black bean and turkey burger versions are available, so everyone should be happy! There are a multitude of toppings and cheeses that can be added to both burgers and salads - a fun option.  The milkshake was a bit thin for my taste but I really wanted to try the Nutella version, which wasn't available the night we dined in. Although not my favorite burger joint around, Bad Daddy's is a fun option to eat with the \"in\" crowd - and it's family friendly to boot.",

    "text": "What a great-tasting, relaxing lunch we had.  Because they're so busy on warm, sunny days, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table outside, but it was worth it.    The restaurant is definitely one of the best burger choices in town.  Big Daddy's has a variety of burgers to choose from, but if you don't find any that appeal to your taste buds, you can create your own.  I went with the Frenchie.  No, not the American Idol chick.  It's so-named because of the Brie cheese it contains, along with turkey burger, bacon, apples, and garlic mayo.  You could say it's almost healthy.  But who cares?  It tasted delicious!!  The only thing I'd recommend is asking for the mayo on the side.  The sandwich was so moist/wet that it kept falling apart.     Big Daddy's also has a buttload of sides you can choose from, so you don't have to stick with fries (although they are good, too!).  I opted for the upgrade to a small salad.  For $2 extra, it was worth it.  I got to pick all the toppings I wanted and it tasted oh-so-good on a hot day.  Every bite was full of flavors that I love...because I got to pick all the toppings!  And there are a LOT of them to choose from.  As a side note, we tried the Duck Fries appetizer once and, yes, we had to ask what they were.  They're apparently regular French fries that have been fried in duck fat.  They only serve these on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, though.  I didn't notice much of a difference in taste, you get a very small amount, and it's probably not very healthy for you.  So, for all those reasons and the fact that they're $6 an order, I'd say skip the duck fries and try a different appetizer.",

Dare I say they may be better than the sweet potato fries at Penguin Drive In?  We were here on a pretty busy night, but we got seated pretty quickly--which was nice. It seems to be a great place for groups/families, and there are some great choices for kids. I may go back here to actually try some of their red meat choices.",

    "text": "Okay I gave them two stars because I have had a nice experience there once before Hence my return. However on this particular occasion I left hungry and dissatisfied. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SERVICE. Our server was excellent however we were seated right away even though the restaurant was relatively busy. Then our server came over and we ordered right away two crispy black bean burgers with tater tots and two kids meals. No modification, just ordered everything as the menu had it. No I understand the restaurant is busy so we had no problem waiting for our food. However I do have a problem when we wait for 35 minutes and the food comes out over cooked and cold. Again not the servers fault. They leave the top bun off the burger so I proceed to put it on and cut it in half. As I put the bun on I notice a long black hair. Mind you I have long black hair but it had sauce on it and it was straight as my hair is curly. Again I give the situation the benefit of the doubt and shrug it off as maybe it is my hair and bite into the half without the hair. Only to find out the my burger is barely room temperature and get this another hair. At this point I notify the manager and they took off my meal accordingly. However I feel like the severity of the situation was being shrugged off. My sons chicken tenders were clearly burnt just by looking at them and my daughters \"cheese\" burger was lacking the \"cheese\" aspect. To make sure it wasn't just my cantina burger that was barely room temperature my husband reassured me that his too was cold. All I'm saying is if I have to wait 35 minutes for two FRIED veggie burgers and a FRIED chicken tender and a tiny cheese-less slider it should at least come out hot and hairless.",

If that's the case, this place should be called Bad Daddy's Burger & Tater Tot Bar.  At this point, I'm starting to become a regular at this place.  Their burgers are consistently good and you will NOT leave hungry.  The tater tots on the side are a great accompaniment to a burger.  Golden brown and full of deliciousness.  I highly doubt they make their own tots in house, but at least they cook them perfectly.  I've also had their salads, and that side of spicy ranch dressing certainly has a kick to it.  But aside from the food, there are two reasons why this place stands out to me.  First, if you're trying to eat healthy, you can get a salad on the side instead of tots/fries.  Second, they have make-your-own options for both Salads and Burgers.  Not only can you get what you want, but if you want to eat healthy, you can make your own food choices while your friend stuffs their face.  Service is OK.  Everyone is really friendly, but it can sometimes be a while if you're trying to flag down your waiter/waitress.  Go early if you don't want a long wait!",

The have a great choices of burgers all are very flavorful, and I would come back here everyday if I could.  So a sticking point for me on a 5 star review for a burger place is that the place MUST cook the burger the way you want it, med rare, med, med well .....  These do exactly that! If I ask for a med burger and it come out well I'm not going to give a good review.  These burgers have creativity in them and they are all worth a try.  Oh yea, they are also pet friendly.",

    "text": "Wow!  Simply wow!  It was my first time here and a bacon cheeseburger was calling my name.  A \"Bacon cheeseburger on steroids\" to be specific.  My waitress hears my order and that it was my first visit and turns to a fellow waiter who says \"add a fried egg, tots on the side and sub Texas toast for the bun.\"  I skipped the egg (not what I had a taste for), but took his advice.  A stellar burger... one of the top 10 in my life, kind of burger.  WOW!  --------  Well.. I had to come back and remove a star.  My wife and I went back tonight and had a less than stellar experience.  We ordered a chips and queso appetizer and the chips came out soggy and limp, dripping with oil.  We sent it back and skipped the appetizer.  My burger and tots was tasty, but my wife's burger was so salty that I wish that I hadn't tasted it (seriously... it crunched from all of the salt).  Her fries were limp and soggy like the chips, just an oily mess.  Despite the waiter's apology for the appetizer and the manager dropping by, the appetizer was still on the check when the bill came (they took it off without argument).  Maybe it's time to take a break from this place for a while.  ---------  EDIT:  We've been back 3-4 times since and the service is back to their normal standards.  The kitchen must have been having a rough night.  I'm putting star #5 back.",

I don't want to get into specifics because despite the cooks major errors and bad timing, the floor staff gets 5 stars for excellent customer service and based on their excellent behaviors this moves this original 1 star review to 3 stars, (((the cook))) deserves the 1 not the waitress nor the hostess or even the manager. The lesson? Customer service when effectively executed wins over all bad sichs every-time and these people know how to handle these situations, granted my case was unusual but this was a stellar staff and believe it or not I will be returning to review when they least expect it! My advice? Only order their hamburgers, the non hamburger menu can get messy for an untrained kitchen staff...",

Tried the southern burger with chili, relish, american cheese, and chipotle mayo - quite interesting and definately turned my normally iron-clad stomach.  my wife had the black bean burger and said it was awesome.

    "text": "We stopped in to Bad Daddy's for dinner the other night while driving through Charlotte to get a quick bite to eat. There was a wait for tables so we sat at the bar. The bar tender, Brett was really friendly and helpful. He gave us an explanation of the menu and shared what some of his favorites are. The menu can definitely be intimidating since there are so many options, but boy, what fun!    You can select one of their 'pre-defined' burgers, or  build any burger that you want.  You have the choice of beef, chicken, turkey,buffalo,  black bean or even ahi tuna for your burger, and many topping, condiment and cheese selections.The salads work the same way, you choose your lettuce and then choose the vegetables, cheese, proteins, toppings and dressing that you would like. The DH and I decided to split a salad and a burger. We added the jalapeno bacon at Brett's recommendation to our burger and boy was that bacon good! It added a nice spice and flavor without being too hot. The burger was cooked perfectly, it was pink, juicy and delicious!  We got the tots for a side and they were served with a nice tasy dipping sauce. I was commenting to my DH that the balsamic vinaigrette was too sweet and Brett heard me and immediately turned around and asked if I'd like some straight balsamic vinegar to tone it done. That was just what it needed and I was really impressed with that level of service.   Even though this is a chain, they seem to work hard to make you feel like it's your neighborhood burger joint. I'm very excited that we have one in Raleigh now and can't wait to try it out!",

I was in Charlotte a few weeks back to visit friends, this was our first stop.  And, we went back.   The burgers were great and I had two.  The Mama Ricotta's and the Frenchie.  Both were incredible.  The Frenchie was a turkey burger and was mouth wateringly delicious.  The apples, turkey and brie, bacon and delicious house mayo was incredible.   This was not for the health conscious, despite being turkey, but for the taste conscious, it was fantastic.  The sides were as good as the main course.  From the tator tots to the sweet potato fries, it was all wonderful.  The pimmento mac and cheese...i could go on for hours!  Beyond the food, the drinks and desserts were wonderful.  I have to advocate LOUDLY for the Peanut Butter milk shake.  Peanut butter, being one of my favorites, was an incredible treat.  This super thick shake was delicious. One of my companions ordered an adult shake, spiked with various liquors which she claims out did mine; a matter of perception I suppose.  Either way...there was nothing bad about this place.  There is indoor and outdoor seating, the wait staff was fantastic...this place is the real deal.    I would not return to Charlotte without taking a lovely drive through Dilworth to Big Daddy's!",

    "text": "This burger bar, a place I usually want to come visit when I visit Charlotte, offers up a pretty tasty burger, though not the best I've ever had. The reason I like it so much isn't because the actual burgers are that amazing, but because of the huge variety of stuff you can get on top of said burgers. It's amazing, and most turn out more deliciously than you can imagine. My favorite is the Frenchie, which is brie, apples, bacon, and garlic aioli on a turkey burger - which I almost always switch out for beef. There aren't many places you can get brie and apples on a burger, and I'm pretty obsessed with it. There are a billion other choices like that, or you can construct your own weird burger (the last time we went, a friend got grilled pineapple, queso, and bacon on a turkey burger... and she loved it).   The sides are also tasty, but not really the main draw for me. Everyone seems to like the sweet potato fries here, which I actually think are really bland without the sauce, and I like a good sweet potato fry that stands up without sauce. These don't. The regular fries are good, similar to Five Guys, as are the tater tots, which are pretty standard, but nice and crispy, which I appreciate. Ask for some sauces (chipotle ranch? yes.) to improve your potato-based experience.  OK, now for a few cons -- it's always so crowded, and loud inside. Expect to wait in the parking lot for a parking space, and inside for a table unless you're incredibly lucky or come at like 11 am on a Tuesday. Because it's always so busy, the wait staff can be hit and miss too. Most of my experiences have been pretty good, once you actually sit down.  With regards to the actual meat, I feel they could improve in this area. They obviously don't grind their own sirloin, which is pretty surprising AND disappointing for a so-called burger bar. Because of this, you can't get a burger cooked less than medium. No favorite burger of mine is ever going to be more than medium-rare, so this is very sad for me. I do have to say that the beef burger was remarkably juicy for being cooked medium and not being fresh-ground.   In conclusion, if you're a burger purist seeking out the best burger on the planet, this place isn't going to have it. But if you're a burger adventurist and want to put all kinds of weird stuff on your burger, then you'll love it here. Worth a try for anyone.",

Our server was nice enough and very attentive, but when that is the best part of the experience, it's not good. My girlfriend and I both order various forms of their Bacon Cheeseburger. I ordered mine to be cooked medium and it came out well done. My girlfriend ordered her burger medium well and it came out medium rare. I decided to just go ahead and eat my burger, while she decided to send it back and have it cooked longer.   The amount of grease that was dripping off both our burgers was too much for us. We both ended up eating almost half of our burgers out  of pure hunger more than anything else. I was really shocked at the quality of burger from a \"burger bar\". The fries were decent.   The restaurant itself has a pretty cool look to it, but it is very loud, almost like you are in a school cafeteria. I'm not quite sure where all the hype comes from for this place? It comes off as a desperate attempt to be the cool local burger joint that everyone thinks is cool to say they go there.   There are numerous places, not only on East blvd, but in the greater Charlotte area that I would recommend to get a burger.   Maybe it was just a one time bad experience, but like my rating says... \"eek! me thinks not.\"",

My boyfriend had the ahi tuna burger with asian slaw, which was also stunningly good.

One time I was stealing bacon from my Dad's burger. The waiter caught me and brought me bacon of my own. The food is 4 stars. My favorite is the kid sliders and my Dad likes the Frenchie.  The sweet potato fries are awesome.  The ambience is 4 stars. They even let me bring my dog on the patio.",

I tried four times thinking it was just a couple bad experiences, but each time it was more of the same... burgers were basically salt-licks.  Their saving grace initially was the tater tots and onion straws, but those too are over salted.  Save yourself the high blood pressure and make your own burger at home.  At least then you can control your salt intake.",

    "text": "Mmmmmmm......burgers.....  I was back in my new-old-new hometown this week for some business meetings. I am really impressed with how Charlotte has developed over the past five years. It is no Atlanta or Boston but it has its own unique charm. One of my favorite hoods is Dilworth.   One of my co-workers said he was craving a burger so of course I yelped it. Parking was a bit of a chore but we found a spot near by. Big Daddy's BB was still busy around 9:00PM so we opted to sit outside. It was nice but a bit chilly so it would have been nice to have the heaters blowing.   We ordered a round of beers and looked over the menu. The menu could have been organized better. It was a hard to read in low light and the appetizers selection was kinda lame. We went with nacho apps that were on special which was a suggestion of our server. They were some pretty lame nachos. Upgrading the apps should be a priority since most of them looked lame. But hey, you don't come to a burger bar for finger food. On to the main course, I went for the chicken club burger. It was a little sloppy but was delicious. I really enjoyed my tater tots but the big daddy's sauce was bland and didn't stand out for me.   Big Daddy's is a great place to grab a burger and beer and just people watch in Dilworth.",

I ordered the buffalo western burger (but added lettuce and tomato), it comes open faced and the lack of bbq sauce was noted. The burger was well done with no flavor in the actual meat, with little sauce causing it to be overly dry. I asked for a side of ranch and tried ketchup without luck of improving the over cooked meat. The parmesan fries with aioli were delicious as a side though!",

We've been to this location several times PY (Pre Yelp) and we've become accustomed to this particular locations food and service quality, but it doesn't hold at other locations in CLT unfortunately.     The parking here though is awful and during the week,  \"fuh-get-aboutit,\"  unless you arrive at 1130a.  But being the weekend it was a bit better but not by much and we lucked out with an open spot.  There's ample seating inside and out albeit can be a bit tight inside.  We were promptly sat and didn't take long for the drinks, placing the app order, and the lunch selections.  Choices this time were fried pickles,  all American burger with onion rings,  bison burger,  and all American with tots.  It was shark eyes all around.   Those who've read my post know that is my saying to describe the frenzy or rather enjoyment due to the quality of the food,  i.e., when sharks feed they have a protective film that extends to cover their eyes to protect against the food particles/blood etc. from damaging their eyes,  so you get the idea :).  Yep, so the fam had shark eyes all around  ;)!  They really enjoyed the food.  Total came to 62.00 including tip for 3 people and an app, so it's a bit pricey imo, but this particular location serves good quality food with good service and has done so consistently so its worth it.",

My husband and I stopped in to Bad Daddy's for dinner one night and it will definitely stay on our burger rotation. This place is no frills. Don't come here for a boujee burger. Come here for a bad*** burger. The staff were friendly and our server was incredibly helpful in deciding what we wanted. I came for a burger but the make your own salad option was so tempting (I know, a salad, but seriously stick with me here). I built a salad with buttermilk fried chicken on top (told you) and my husband built a burger with housemade American and bacon. Everything was massive and delicious. My server was even kind enough to put my salad in a larger bowl so it wouldn't spill over the sides (apparently that happens when you add toppings). The chicken was hot and fresh and so crispy. There was also a nice spice to it either in the batter or from marinating. I also really enjoyed the chipotle ranch dressing. The burger was juicy and the bun was perfect. Besides the awesome food and service they have a decent drink selection. I can never find decent wine at casual places but I had a great glass of red here. Next time I'll make my husband order the salad so I can steal from his plate, and I'll get the burger.",

The last 4 or 5 times we've been there, either for dine-in or take out, they have not gotten a single order correct. Yes, in all fairness we tend to make modifications to the menu due to food allergies, but the lack of attention to detail is boggling; both on behalf of the servers and the cooks. Even when you write your order on the salad/burger 'cheat sheets'. This carelessness is also reflected in how they fail to clean the place - it's frankly just gross. Walk passed the kitchen sometime on your way to the bathroom and peek in - food all over the floor, servers standing around running their fingers through their hair, yuck. The dining room isn't much better; table edges sticky with food that wasn't cleaned up, the creases of the booths similarly full of funk. Bartenders barely interact with bar patrons and spend more time socializing with server staff than their customers. They can't seem to keep staff either, and while over the first few years of patronage we got to know many of the servers and managers, we haven't seen a familiar face in the last year. Also even if you call in a take-out order, expect 30 to 45 minute wait times, and badly incorrect orders. Completely unacceptable.  We stopped going to this location, as the location in Ballantyne/South Charlotte is worlds more clean, and they get the orders correct!  EDIT: Please see the unbelievable response from their corporate office below... Can they not escalate these matters themselves to the local GM? They actually want ME to waste MY time escalating this FOR THEM?  Hmmmm, I wonder if the problem is more systemic than local....",

    "text": "I was initially drawn to this restaurant because of its American style menu and burger choices (I love a good burger). Upon arriving we were immediately greeted and asked if we had a table preference. We didn't so we sat at a night near the bar. The restaurant is very crowded in that seating is very close and you are in an intimate space with the person beside you. The server Christina came and took our drink orders and asked if we wanted an appetizer. She didn't go over the specials or mention the happy hour. When we asked her about items on the menu she didn't know how they were prepared or what they contained. And honestly really didn't seem to care that she didn't know some of the menu items. She referred to items on the menu as \"oh yea that looks good\" and pointed to the selection.  I ordered the Lovely-Rita which was the absolute worst Margarita I've had in my life. It tasted like watered down Orange juice lime and some weird after taste. I ordered a Moscow Mule afterwards which I didn't really cafe for either but stuck with it because I like ginger beer. The only reason I gave 3 starts is because the burger saved the experience. Also I order it medium and it came well done, it was \"juicy\" and had great flavor. I order the smokehouse with sweet potatoes fries. I would come back for a burger, but it will be to go.",

They cook my burger to a perfect medium and its never dried out. I especially like the side salad option and that you get to pick your own ingredients. It certainly is NOT one of those premade iceberg salad mixes like you get at some places. You get to choose between 4 greens (I get spinach) and then can add 7 additional ingredients. It has been too long since I have been by Bad Daddy's and I expect to be back real soon!",

    "text": "I've been here several times but have failed to write about it!!  I graced BD's with my presence yet again this past Friday and I was certainly NOT disappointed!!  They are pretty consistent with everything so it is hard to go wrong.  They pretty much have something for everyone and obviously their burgers are fresh, flavorful and unique!  I have even tried the black bean burger and that was fantastic!  It had a crispy surfaces so you don't feel like you are eating a mush burger which can tend to be the case in other places.  I love the make-your-own burger option.  I also love the make-your-own salad option.  They have fresh ingredients and plenty of options to make your salad satisfying!  The fried pickles are pretty good but I would rather if they were cut into round pieces but beggers can't be choosers!  The ranch dressing they serve alongside the pickles is heavenly.  I LOOOOVE the sweet potatoe fries.  They are always crispy and the perfect cut.  Yummy!  The milkshakes are good, thick, tasty, cold...you know...what they SHOULD be.  The snickers milkshake is sorta like a chocolate milkshake with a few small peanuts floating around.  They either need to add more snickers or carmel or something to make it more distinct in my opinion.    The atmosphere is what it should be...loud, packed, large screen TV's, a hustle in the air and I have never been there without having to wait for at least a few minutes.  This is a good, reliable, neighborhood bar/restaurant.  ***Considering the type of restaurant I shouldn't expect a stellar wine list but they have a VERY limited wine selection and they are too expensive for the brands they are serving.",

But today's experience was cut short and has left me feeling pretty gross. The first table we sat at had ants all around! We literally killed at least 6 ants, before we even ordered our food. And we were inside by the way, not on the patio... So we requested to move to a different table. They apologized and offered us a free appetizer which was nice. But once I got halfway done with my salad, we saw roach on the wall!! At that point my appetite vanished immediately. We didn't tell them about the roach, just asked for a box, paid our bill and peeled outta there. It hurts me to say that I will not be returning to this location. :(",

I make sure to make a visit to Bad Daddys at least once a month. The tater tots are out of this world, not to mention that the sauce that compliments them only makes them even better!   Although the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, my favorite burger, never fails me. Great flavors that are packed within only one burger and a great atmosphere within the establishment itself. Although be warned the place can become pretty busy during peak hours, which can easily be avoided by download the nowait app and getting yourself in the wait line before you get there.  Like I said this a restaurant I've come to rely on over the years for great food and great service and I hope I'll be able to continue to rely on it in the years ahead.",

The rather poorly named Big Daddy's is located in the Dilworth neighborhood next to a lot of trendy restaurants. I expected Big Daddy's to be some douchey burger place with a lot of obnoxious people and loud music and too many TVs. It is a big of a sports bar but it was a nice place with great service. I'm always glad when I'm proved wrong about these things.  The place is busy. According to my friend there is always a wait. There is a large outdoor covered patio. The interior is big and industrial with a large bar area. There are a lot of TVs but the place wasn't super loud or annoying. The place is really clean and very nice.  I ordered the Frenchie which was a turkey burger with brie and grilled apples. It was delicious. I thought it was one of the best burgers I've had in a while. I also got the sweet potato fries which were really crispy and delicious.  The only problem was that my friends were freezing. There were fans on and open windows and it was really cold inside. I was fine but my two lady friends were very cold even though they had sweaters. Maybe it was just a weird weather day but might be something to consider.  I am glad that we tried this place. I would absolutely go back if given the chance.",

My food was hot and delicious.  The staff was friendly and the manager checked on us.  I always appreciate it when management checks on you even if it is busy.    I had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back.   There are several other burgers I want to try.",

My burger was good, sweet potato fries were warm, not hot, but this tends to happen at a lot  of places. Bartender was really friendly and welcoming. He made suggestions and was helpful! I also treated myself to a spiked milkshake (so if I did have a heart attack, I would already be in heaven) soooo goood! I'm not sure what more I would need to make it a 5, maybe because I was comparing to an upscale burger chain Zin Burger (on the west coast )  Ballantyne location",

    "text": "We've been going to Big Daddy's since it first opened and it used to be our \"regular\" spot up until about 4-5 months ago.  The food has just gotten too inconsistent.  I agree, when you go and the food is cooked to order it is fantastic.  One of the best burgers around.  But of the last three times I have been, two of those times my burger was way overdone, almost charred on the outside.  When I'm in the mood for a burger, I want it to be cooked exactly like I ordered.  We also used to love Big Daddy's for its salads.  They were fresh, with great flavor and presentation.  In my opinion, the salads in general have gone downhill.  The lettuce and some of the vegetables are watery, there's not a lot of flavor at all and it just looks and tastes bland.  Not to mention that their balsamic dressing in particular continually changes from week to the next.  It was sooo much better in its original form.  Every time they try to change it it gets less and less flavorful.  So it's the inconsistency from one visit to the next that gives them only three stars.  Still a great atmosphere and sometimes our meal is fantastic, but too many times I walk out thinking that it just wasn't that great and not wanting to go back for a while.  So this unfortunately isn't our \"go to\" spot like it used to be, but I'm hopeful that the place will turn back around into what they were when they first opened.",

My favorite burger is the \"Sam I Am\" burger which has ham, pesto, and a fried egg on top.  Don't' forget to order tots with your burger.  They have a beer flight which offers four 3oz tastes of beer, great for when you can't decide.  They also have daily drink specials which are a decent deal.",

Most likely this isn't a place you'd go looking for a truly gourmet burger but more or less a greasy burger with a large variety of toppings and flavors.  I was glad to have the option to create my own burger when I couldn't quite find just the right mix on the menu.    Saturday lunch is quite crowded with families/kids but the wait wasn't terrible.  The sweet potato fries were a thin cut, nice texture.  The tater tots were well cooked but perhaps the oil could be a little cleaner.    My husband got the Bahn Mi pork burger.  It was a little greasy but the flavors were good.  I created a turkey burger.  It was a little charred for my preference.    The beer selection/variety was good with local brews from NC as well as other states including imports such as Chimay.  I noticed they have shake specials but didn't have the room for dessert.  There is a bar area and outdoor seating.  I can do without a television at every venue in town while I'm trying to eat!",

The burgers are big and I never think I'm going to finish them, but they're so good I always do. I love all the different fry side options, especially the crispy, seasoned tater tots. It took me forever to try the Mama Ricotta's burger because it sounded kind of weird, but after I ordered it once, it was the only thing I got. It is AWESOME! The shakes (adult and virgin) are also really good - nice, thick, and not overly sweet.  The only drawbacks I've ever encountered were slow, forgetful service once when we had a party of about a dozen (understandably), and I thought that the turkey burger was overly greasy and not very good.",

Skip the fried pickles, they are too greasy and too salty.  They use pickles cut long ways and they get too soft when cooked.  I prefer fried pickles from The Penguin.  The wait on the weekends is always too long for a burger, usually at least an hour, and they don't have any place to sit inside while you wait.  Despite the wait I still look forward to going to Big Daddy's for a burger.  They just opened a new store in Ballantyne, I'm hoping to try it out soon.",

The interiors are fine, nothing crazy but here's my biggest issue inside...the bar height.  Or maybe it's the stools.  Either way, sit at the bar and you'll know what I mean.  The stools are too short and you feel like the counter is more than nipple high!  Weird and makes for awkward posturing during your meal.  My second issue is outside.....one word....parking.  There basically is none.  Going during lunch is like a quest similar to the game Zelda.  Most times you'll find yourself parking down the street a good bit and walking back.  Not a HUGE deal and seriously it's sort of an indicator that they must be doing something right because people don't seem to mind and keep the place pretty packed as far as I can tell.  I love the Asian Chicken Salad and of course the burgers (pretty much any) are fantastic.  Bottom line, don't let the parking issue get in the way and give Bad Daddy's (previously Big Daddy's) a shot!",

You'll definitely need a large appetite & big mouth to tackle these burgers, but you won't be able to put them down. They do have other menu items other than the burger, but why would you try anything else?  This is another one of those options places, so if you have trouble making decisions (much like me) then be prepared to be blown away at your choices. They have conidments, toppings, premium toppings, bun selection, meat selection, cheese choice, wow...But it all equals up to a great burger with what you want on it, no rigid menu choices for me.  If headed for lunch, prepare for extra time, not only to find a parking spot & table, but also to finish your burger. But Big Daddy's is well worth the added time that your boss might not appreciate you using during lunch.",

After reading the menu, I was practically salivating all over the place!  They have an amazing menu and you can substitute veggie, black bean, buffalo burgers instead of the regular beef and I finally settled on the Cantina 1511 Burger--a black bean burger topped with green chiles, avocado, Monterrey and Cheddar Cheese with a Chipotle Ranch. You can also substitute a salad as your side for only $2 more and you can create a side salad--how awesome is that? I got a side salad with baby spinach, red peppers, feta, strawberries, jalapenos and walnuts with Balsamic vinaigrette.   I was raving about this to a co-worker and she mentioned they have \"adult\" shakes with alcohol.....say what? Sold. I will definitely be going back here--but will be working out earlier so I can indulge again.",

We were able to patronize the establishment as long as we dined on the patio (with me on the outside of the fence, is the rule.).  It was a wicked hot day and I'm a black dog!  I was grateful for the shade and many fans provided by management.  Everyone was soooo very nice to me.  The waitress offered to bring me water, but my owner already had a bowl and water bottle, along with some special treats to keep me from fraternizing with the other patrons.  My owner ordered the special of the day with tater tots.  She tells me they are the BEST tater tots in the country and she should know....she travels quite a bit. (Or at least she did until she adopted me!!)  The mac & cheese hamburger special was spectacular.  I know because she shared it with me.  Apparently I'm lactose intolerant so I did get any of the cheesy bits.  However, she gave me half of the delicious hamburger and the ALL of the rosemary ham it came with.  I couldn't have the tots since I'm only 6 months old...[not sure why that is relevant, but I trust her judgment.]  We will definitely come back for lunch.  Out of respect for the other guests, we'll likely not come during dinner since little kids LOVE me and would be distracted from eating their meals!  Thank you Big Daddy for being so welcoming!",

Bad Daddy's can meet all these requirements and more!  I've been here at least once a month for the last year and I've never been disappointed.  Bad Daddy's has a great staff, and an amazing menu.  You can get really creative with your burgers here.  And don't forget to check out what you can do with salads, too!  Almost anything you want is here.  They also do some very interesting things for their specials, so always be sure to ask about those.   We've had a fontina burger, a pulled pork burger (a hamburger with delicious pulled bbq pork on top), and a few others with interesting additions such as pimento cheese and jalepeno bacon.  Bad Daddy's is also popular for their milkshakes.  They have several interesting and yummy flavors (chunky elvis!) and can also make them more \"spirited\" if that's what you're looking for.  This is a locally owned business, and the owner has several popular restaurants in town.  You just cannot go wrong here, everything they do is done with care and attention.  Don't forget to try the tots.  They're just about perfect and come with a kickin' sauce!",

The burgers were rather tasty, but my fresh cut fries were so cold, and inedible; very disappointing! I wanted to order a Vodka on the rocks, but they only had Absolut Vodka left out of several choices at 8:00pm on a Saturday night! I guess what do you expect from a burger joint. Also, they allow dogs on the patio, I love dogs, but I don't want to be around them when I am eating my food. I could of just went inside, but I didn't realize dogs were allowed until, I was already into my meal, and until I noticed the dog bowls on the patio! I will probably go back here, but only for lunch or carry out! I was kind of expecting burgers and cocktails, and just got Five Guys, but at least Five Guys have hot fries!!",

    "text": "I am officially 5 lbs heavier than I was 2 hours before dinner here.   APPS: We started with the Bacon Cheesebuger Mac n Cheese. Seriously - this is THE BEST mac n cheese I've ever had. Perfectly cheesy, creamy, and chock full of burger patties and crispy bacon pieces.   The fried pickles were interesting, and served with a side of ranch. Don't think I would get these next time since it was 85% fat and oil, and 15% pickle. No points deducted because everything on the menu that is any good has a comparable nutrition value.  BURGERS: Sam I Am - AMAZING. Added mushrooms and avocado and it was perfect. So perfect I didn't even dip into the spicy sauce it came with. I chose the tater tots as my side, meh... TOO SALTY. Other options include salads.  DESSERTS: Desserts were pretty unimpressive. I settled with the banana pudding for lack of better options (instead of the brownie with fudge and ice cream, apple cobbler, or milkshakes). $5 gets you a heaping portion of whipped cream, a couple chopped bananas, and a generous drizzle of caramel. Not bad, but far too rich and not banana-y or pudding-y enough.  The wait was about 20 minutes at 8:15pm which I find odd in Charlotte, but the waitress was friendly and the food came out pretty quick. There are cool milkshake options you can order with alcohol, beer samples, and about 10 different types of bottled beer (yum, they have Rogue!). There's alfresco seating, but the patio was full so we sat by a huge flat screen TV, perfect for all you sports fans. The waitress also split our extremely complex bill in many complex ways without any complaints. Plus, the owner came out to make sure everything was good! Extra points for that.  The only downfall is that I need to detox for 5 days now :(",

Omar pounded down a big milkshake before we even had supper and we all shared some fried pickles. Bad Daddy's fried pickles are tasty but they aren't my favorite in Charlotte. They slice them long ways which makes them a bit more difficult to eat since aren't \"bite-size.\" Slicing them into chips is a better method in my opinion.  Omar had the nachos because he gets nachos everywhere, even at a burger joint. I shared the Texican Chicken Salad with Juji. It was delicious and felt less naughty than a burger. But their burgers are amazing, I've had way too many of them. I'm partial to the black bean burger, but don't be fooled into thinking that's a healthier option than beef. Great burger choices are the Cantina (black bean), the Frenchie (turkey burger), and the Carolina (beef). Some girls got lettuce wrapped burgers and loved them, and one guy got the Big Ass Burger. That one is ridiculous. Fried Bacon?? It was like 8\" tall.   Bad Daddy's has a good selection of beers local, domestic and import. I had an OMB Copper because it's hard for me to choose anything else when that one is staring at me.  Recommended!",

I had for the first time, jalepeno bacon here!!!  OMG, it was awesome.  I love jalepenos.  I love bacon.  the combination rocks!  I did a small side salad for a side.  It's fun, you get to build it from your greens to toppings to dressing!  I know they have great drink specials on certain nights.  This is a super casual spot with a small patio.  Both times I have been I was with a group, and we all had a great time!  Not a date spot, but casual eats for sure!",

    "text": "Solid burgers, solid service, good beer selection, amazing sweet potato fries, and great location are just a few of the factors that keep me coming back to Bad Daddy's time and time again.   I'm not a vegetarian, but I often order their black bean burger because it is \"slap me in the face\" good! I've also had several of their salads, and really like the Gigante Tuna salad -who knew gigante beans paired so well with seared tuna?  I've never been disappointed with Bad Daddy's, my only complaint is that the place is pretty small and the main dining area is quite narrow. The cramped space makes me a bit claustrophobic, so I usually try to sit on the patio so that I don't feel as cramped.   The service is attentive, but I've had a few instances where I've asked to have things such as my salad dressing on the side or to have a lettuce wrap on my burger instead of a bun and the order has come out incorrect -none of that is a big deal, but lesson learned -I always confirm that the server remembers my modifications.  Bad Daddy's is our go-to burger spot, because it never disappoints!",

I ordered the portabella mushroom burger, which was battered and fried. I was totally impressed with how delicious and unique this sandwich was! However, I'm looking at the online menu and don't see it listed, please say it ain't so...  The sweet potato fries were super yummy, I ate every last one of them!   I wasn't the biggest fan of the atmosphere here, but that's because sports bars aren't my thing and that's totally what this place is.   Will definitely come back, probably just on a weekday when Big Daddy's isn't so loud and busy.",

It wasn't jump off a building good, but it was good.  So apparently they purposefully don't put the burger centered on the bun, so I had to touch it to push it on.  Messy fingers. Large burger so I would suggest getting it cut.  The bread was really good.  I ordered the tater tots and they were the best I've ever had! Like Word!  They were so crispy, I didn't even use ketchup.  They were great all my themselves!  Was too full to try a milkshake but will next time.  10/17/18",

Fortunately there are no shortages of keto friendly options at Bad Daddy's whether it's a lettuce wrap or a burger in a bowl. This also includes lots of great topping options for keeping that fat to protein ratio whether that's a generous portion of avocado or the various bacon options. You can even top off your keto creation with the piece de resistance, a fried egg.  Never once have they done me wrong, always prompt and polite service even if I get a sideways glance or two about not wanting a side   KCKO, Charlotte!",

Their  ba \"con\" queso is kinda off for us. It tasted somewhat like burnt cheese and bacon; tooo much salt/seasoning on their chips!!! Too much salt on their tater tots too!!!! We didnt even finish eating our sides because of it.   We ordered their Pittsbuger and their buffalo burger. We are not that impressed at all. We would rather eat at Bang Bang burgers! The patties were too dry and not seasoned at all! Their food isn't that amazing.   We left without being satisfied at all. After a while, our stomachs doesn't feel good. We have not eaten anything else different from our usual except for the burgers. My husband and I have not been feeling great since.  Diagnosed with stomach bugs and now have to take antibiotics!",

My first visit to this location was good as expected - the layout is a little weird/cramped but it's probably because space in this neighborhood is at a premium ( you put things where you have to put them) . The bathrooms are a little too close to the drink prep stations and you feel like you're going to crash into the waitstaff.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is a giant, delicious bird beast! An amazing sandwich! Order it without hesitation!  I had the Mama Ricotta today - fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomato and pepperoncini, cooked perfect medium (paired with a Triple C 3C IPA).  Two of my favorite things about Bad Daddy's - 1) they nail the temperature on my burger every time I order (and they're juicy to boot) 2) the adult Milkshakes - Cookie and Cream with Bailey's in it - yum - completely, wonderfully, delightfully excessive and decadent, but a must do - even if you have to share... okay so I thought of a third, 3) the tots - holy cow the tots - fresh, crispy, delicious - don't know if they air fry, oven bake, partially deep fry - I don't care because they are pretty close to the perfect tot.",

Next I had the patty melt with sweet potatoe fries. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and it was very flavorful. Always a plus with ordering sweet potato fries is that it comes with a special sauce( I hate when it doesn't). They had one that was so good! Wanted to dip  everything in it. I would defiantly come here again, but skip the bar unless you want to hear and see all the ins and outs of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best burger spots in charlotte. I've been to several of their locations and th hey are always consistent. Never have had a disappointing night at bad daddy's. Make sure to come here ready to eat because you will want to eat everything on the plate. It's always a toss up between the bacon burger on steroids and Emilio's chicken. Bothe arr absolutely fantastic. The chicken is juicy and tender and the burgers are mouthwatering and cooked to perfection. Not to mention three different types of bacon on a single burger... you can't beat that. The sides are always delicious. Usually go with tots which are always fresh and hot. If you and the boys are starving and looking to demolish some burgers swing through bad daddy's. There will be no dissapointment.",

I got on Yelp and saw this BD's was nearby and my daughter begged to go. So we went in and told the girl at the bar we were in a hurry and how long for takeout. She told us it would be about 20mins. I said ok and told her we were in a hurry to see a show. The girl gave us drinks and said it will be out as soon as possible. An HOUR later our food was done!! No joke I looked at my watch when she put in the order and I looked at it again when we grabbed the food. I actually was about to say forget it! we are just going to leave when she finally brought the food out. We didn't even get to eat bc we literally had 10mins before the show was to start. We didn't order anything complicated just 2 very simple cheeseburgers and fries. I know they were busy but really?!? Even a guy who was picking up a food delivery order was fuming because he also was waiting longer than usual for his food and he was losing money for having to wait. Either get a new cook or another cook or something but keep this up and they will really be hurting.",

    "text": "You should never review a restaurant you've only been to once.  That said I went to Big Daddy's soon after they opened in 2007.  I wasn't that impressed at the time.  The service was terrible, they were out of most of their offerings, and I felt it was overpriced.  These things are expected when a new restaurant opens.  It takes some time to work out the kinks.  I had the regular burger.  It was unremarkable.  I went back last weekend figuring that they would have worked out the kinks in their system.  Plus, being a big fan of burgers, I wanted to give them another go.  I had the buffalo burger.  It was good, better than I expected, but again, uninspired.  There was little flavor to the meat and the burger was a bit soggy for my taste.  This surprised me since I cook using buffalo rather than beef fairly often.  And give that the place is owned by the same folks who own Mama Ricotta's, Cantina 1511, and some other fantastic restaurants, I would expect more.  Most of the flavor came from the toppings.  It had the usual lettuce, tomato, onions,  as well as fried onions, and chipotle mayo.  The chipotle mayo was ok.  I like mine with a little more kick.  The fries were average.  I wouldn't go as far as to say they were memorable.  For $11 I can get a better burger.  In fact, I can get a better burger for $3 at Five Guys.  It's a totally different dining experience, but you get the point.  The burgers are over priced.  The service was fantastic this trip.  Even though the place was full of 30 somethings and their kids, I didn't feel like I was ignored.  The drink special was great too.  You can't really beat $2 PBR tall boys.    Overall, I give three stars.  The service was great.  The drink special was awesome.  Those are really all that Big Daddy's has going for it.  Unless you like food that is overly safe but passes itself off as unusual and gourmet.",

My husband had an actual beef burger which he enjoyed but had to eat with a fork because it was so messy (he didn't seem to care!).  The manager came by to be sure everything was fine, which I appreciated.  Our waiter tended to our needs and drink refills without bothering us too much so we could talk.  It was loud in there, but there was a party of about.  Overall, we will definitely go back. Sweet potato fries are FANTASTIC, and I would love to try their Build-your-own salads.

In 8 or so visits in the past few months Big Daddy's has consistently been able to serve up the best burgers I've had in Charlotte. Plus, they have really good fries, excellent sweet potato fries and the ne plus ultra of potato based burger sidekicks tater tots. I'm not certain why tater tots seem to go so perfectly with burgers, whether they actually taste good or it's more of a diabolicaly insidious after effect of school cafeteria tater-tot brainwashing, but the pairing of the tots and the beef puck works. If you dig root beer try the stuff they have on tap.",

My co-worker and I began killing them with what we could find and then we gave one of the note pads with a dead fly on it to the waiter and they looked disgusted - HELLO this shouldn't ever be something a customer should worry about!?! After we would kill a few they just kept coming back. The table top was also very dirty and sticky. It then took 30+ min to get food and at that point I was so grossed out I couldn't eat my meal. Would not eat there until they cleaned the place up and fixed the bug problem.",

If you are able to order you are greeted by the awful smell of dish towels that must have been marinating in water that was last changed during desert storm, the first one. Finally, when you pay you will be treated like they are doing you the biggest favor by fulfilling your order.  The food is good but the experience is so bad I doubt I will go back.  Burger places are a dime a dozen.    Four stars on the food and one star on the service.",

    "text": "I desperately wanted to try the buttermilk battered deep fried bacon but alas I'm a wimp.   I was shocked to see the menu didn't provide sourcing information on the beef or at least where it comes from but then the management had a wait staff training then testing immediately next to our table where they questioned the wait staff about this and there was a written test. Color me baffled because no one talks about this and no one waiting on me referenced any of this info so why test these kids on it? My soror said, it's in case people ask - which was her guess and a way to make fun of my Madisonian ways because in MADTOWN the menu provides this info.   Anywhoo...as for the quality of the meat. Nothing to write home about. It wasn't flavorfully impressive. It was cooked to the right temperature without drying the meat so that was great.   The batter on her fried pickles made me wish I really go the bacon and made me think they'd season everything else since it was nice. The tator tots are not my fav but they had some season. The dipping sauce is mayo based so I can't touch it. All in all, there was a wait as we came at 7:30pm after my interview I wanted beef as in a burger and she took us here. She had the big burger with the buttermilk bacon before and said it was salty so I didn't try it. I had the pulled pork special of the day burger.   The pork was nice on its own. Served with Mont. Jack. added jalapeno bacon and it wasn't spicy at all so don't be scared of it. Got the spiked margarita lemonade offer and pass it along - maybe cuz I'm not a drinker but I appreciate daily specials. They offer meat changes (turkey, tofu, chicken, idk); veggie options to swap and pesto on the menu along with several cheeses but got rid of the three cheese infusion.   Server was sweet. The patio didn't have heat lamps as previously held so we waited inside and the place barely has room to wait for anything other than a menu and a walk out.",

I keep a running tab of burgers ive had in my life in my head for future reference. This fine establishment is now firmly placed at the top of said list.  You know how you always see a picture of a burger on tv or on a menu, and then the meal you actually get is just a depressing disappointment? Well that is NOT the case here. The burger I was given was perfectly picturesque and more importantly, absolutely delicious. Only good things here.  The waitress was also a delight. We talked about our mutual live for tater tots, which are also provided here. With some kind of strange sauce. I'm not a fan of spice, but it, too, was wonderful.   If I had one complaint, it would be the amount of condiments on the burger. It um...overflowed? Shall we say? At least they give you paper towels. Of course this is only a negative if you care about such things. Personally, I prefer too much sauce to too little.  I will be coming here again. :)",

She never once came to me and informed me that there were no beers in the restaurant. When the server returned, I was informed they were out of my requested beer.  I looked in the cooler, which is visible from the bar a d asked the waitress why couldn't I have one of those?  She responded that the cooler was broken.

The staff never checked on me after my meal was served, reappearing only to give me the check.   Wait time for food was too long -- about 45 minutes to get my burger, despite it not being a particularly busy night. The burger itself was well cooked and juicy, but the staff essentially disregarded all my order details. Specifically, I asked for no tomato and received tomato, and I asked for the egg on my burger to be cooked over easy, which they fried completely through. Had the Parmesan Truffle fries as an appetizer, which were pretty lazily prepared.   Most wait staff seemed very pleasant and available but unfortunately this was not my experience.",

    "text": "So, this was my second time visiting a Bad Daddy's restaurant. I first visited the location near Concord Mills when it was first opened and did not enjoy my burger. It was under seasoned, I was brought out a salad in a very small white box that cost $7.99 which only had lettuce and a few shredded carrots, and my beer was warm. The best thing I enjoyed that evening were the tater tots.  Fast forward, I always give restaurants a second chance, if I did not enjoy on my first visit. This Bad Daddy's was even worse. Service was slow, the waitress was scatter brained and told us so herself, fried pickles were super greasy, my burger was overly salted and cold, my bacon was not cooked all the way, and customer service sucked. I told the waitress that my burger was cold and she argued with me and told me that she just watched the cook take it off the grill. The outside of it was slightly warm but the inside was very cold. Maybe it was cooked earlier and they didn't heat it back up enough. Either way, yuck.  I usually order a beer, but I was so unimpressed, I didn't.  Homemade Ranch, BBQ sauce, Fries (after being remade bc they were cold the first time), and the onion straws were delicious.  I will not be back at another Bad Daddy's. I do much better at home myself on my grill, and it's wayyyyy cheaper.",

I know this review will seperate itself from the masses. *shoulder shrug* What did I miss?   Why 3 stars , well they were just average as far as flavor.  I'm sure the burger patty and the toppings /buns are good quality , I like that they have a gluten free option and the food did come out fast .   I got the fried mozzarella burger , supposedly had garlic mayo , and the star of the burger a fried mozzarella patty on top . MEH ... I just couldn't taste a distinguishing layer of flavors . I'm a fan of my burger meat being seasoned, but I understand many just like a slab of red meat on their buns with all the dressings you can think of, not me.  My daughter got the western burger, she said she wouldn't get it again, and I got the kiddie dog for the little one. The tater tots were, tots , the side of spicy mayo to dip them in were cool, but no one bothered to finish their tots. Were oily and bland.   The hostess stand was great, our server ........... dot dot dot dot. He really didn't seem like he wanted to be there. There was some humor in his menu description, and he checked up on us , but maybe my 18% tip wasn't enough to not have the writing pen to sign my receipt thrown at the table? The only reason we ventured into this spot was because it was near the park. Not going to be one of my let's go to Big Daddys Burger Bar anytime soon. There was no YUM factor for anyone in our group.",

    "text": "I really was hoping to give this place a 5 star review but my overall experience was less than desirable.   I was on my way home with my 8 year old daughter and 2 year old niece from the museum. And they were \"starving\" as my daughter expressed. Since i read good reviews about the place and figured it would be great, we decided to have lunch here.   We walked in and waited a few minutes for a table, which while waiting a party just got up and left. That should have been my queue to leave, but i didn't. The hosted went to sit us and told a waiter, which turned out to be my waiter- Thomas, about the couple that walked out and neither of them seemed bothered about it.   We sat, he was attentive and introduced himself and asked for drinks immediately. He brought them quickly and asked if we were interested in appetizers. I ordered the buffalo chicken wings as per my daughters request and i asked Thomas to suggest his most popular appetizer since i was new in the area and it was my first time (moved here a week ago from Miami) and he suggested the fried pickles.   The appetizers came out with a runner which was fine, my daughter enjoyed the wings and the pickles to me were really just not good. They were soggy, and you can taste the oil on them. Now from the time our appetizers got to the table, to the time Thomas game back to actually take our order- 45 minutes had passed. (I know for a fact because i snapped the pickle pic before even tasting them)  He came to take our order after i asked a busser to please call him over. He looks like \"oh shit\" when i saw the message being relayed, but gave him the benefit of the doubt. He apologized and took our order.   My daughter ordered a plain cheeseburger. My niece the kids tenders with fries and i ordered the buffalo chicken. Now, from the time we placed the order til we received our food was about another 40 minutes.   It was so bad the tables around asked us what was going on with our food. Now remember during this whole time i was with a 8 year old which thankfully was watching Netflix on her phone but this 2 year old was starting to become very restless.   It was so bad the waiter came over to explain that our whole meal would be comped and we wouldn't have to pay for anything.   When we finally received our food, my tots were over fried. Very dark and greasy. I asked for the babies salt to be unsalted and that didn't happen. My fried buffalo chicken was supposed to have ranch and that didn't make it. My water was never refilled, i shared with the baby, and finally i decided to leave and left him a $15 tip just because of the broken crayons and mess on the table.   Thomas tried to turn the situation around and i appreciate our meal being comped but i wasn't persuaded. I was a server so i know you can forget about a table when being double sat, but the quality of the food just finished off my bad experience. A manager never made it to my table to apologize. Our meal was comped but the food didn't come out hot. Or even properly so i feel like treatment should have been made better to try to make sure i came back again.   I would not return. I would not recommend. I've learned about so many delicious places in my new hometown and to me just isn't worth risking.",

The service is great, the restaurant looks clean and orderly, and I've never had a problem with the food. When I came to this restaurant, I expected the same standard, but was highly disappointed. When I entered the restaurant, it was cluttered and looked messy and unorganized. We then ordered our usual of a Daddy's Dragonberry cocktail and black bean burger. The cocktail was not in the usual mason jar and didn't have any blueberries which is supposed to be presented in the drink. We the ordered our burger and when it came out, had no toppings at all. They gave us a bare black bean burger with cheese on the top. The burger is supposed to come with avocado, tomato, onion, pickles, and lettuce. We brought it to their attention and then brought the toppings to the table for us to build ourselves. If I wanted to make my own food, I would have just stayed home and done that. To top it all off, the server was not attentive at all and rarely checked on us at all. When we told her about the issue, she was not apologetic at all and did not return to the table. And overall terrible experience. Do not come here.",

So many choices on a burger made it really fun for our family. The buttermilk bacon was so yummy. A definite visit every time we visit for sure. Go Niners !",

They have build your own burger or salad cards at the table where you can select various toppings and even create a custom name. Our server was really on top of it despite being hungover, which he told us more than a couple times.   I had a build your own salad with bacon, blue cheese, lots of veggies, and a turkey burger patter. My turkey burger came out pink inside--this would be fine for beef but is dangerous when it's poultry. They fixed the mistake and the salad was pretty yummy and suuuuuuper filling. I just had water, but they do have a pretty good beer list if you have a hankerin'. I'll note they don't have coffee, so get your caffeine fix ahead of time if you're coming earlier in the day.   Only other complaint was the big, messy table covered in employee's stuff and snacks right next to the restroom. It's just my personal opinion that these shouldn't be left out for customers to see or should at the very least be less clutter-y. Not sure that Bad Daddy's would be my first choice next time, but it's not a bad option either.",

The waitress came over to take our order pretty quickly, but we didn't see her again until the end of the meal when we had to find her to get our bill. Nobody came to ask if our food was good or if we needed anything after it was delivered to us by another waiter. We ordered a beer and had to ask another waiter to deliver it because our waitress never came back. I had the Swiss burger. I asked for it to be medium, but it came well done. It was still pretty good but not exactly what I wanted. I never got a refill on my soda because our waitress never came back. The bathroom was disgusting. I had to lift the toilet seat for my 4 year old son to go potty and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week! The toilet seat was also broken. Not sure why they can't afford a new toilet seat and make sure the bathroom is clean! I will never go back to this location. I had eaten at the one in Ballantyne and was happy with the experience, but this one ruined it for us.",

Was told it would be about 20-25 minute wait. I thought it was reasonable for the timing and my order so I went outside and sat in my car for about 25 minutes.   I came back and asked if my food was finished and was told it was coming right up and would be about 5 more minutes. I was fine with that because timing isn't always exact. 25 more minutes of standing inside I FINALLY received my order. It took almost 1 hour! Triple the estimated time! Wish I could have canceled my order. At that point i was just happy to have my food because I was starving.   Wait, it gets better....When I got home, I opened my meal to find a cold burger with cheese only on it. NO TOPPINGS. What in the world??? I am so disappointed in the service at this restaurant. I was excited to have a nice burger for dinner but instead was very, very underwhelmed with the quality of food and service I received.  In addition, there were also delivery service drivers waiting inside for their customers food for over 30 minutes having to cancel on the people who ordered them. What a shame. Won't be going back there.   Here's a picture of my sad, sad burger.",

They have breakfast from 9-11 and we got there at 10 with plenty of people in the dining room. I ordered banana pancakes and my brother got biscuits with gravy.  My pancakes were bananay, in a good way.  I could taste and see the banana's.  My brother also really enjoyed his biscuits.  It was a huge serving that included an egg on top.  He said it was a bit spicy, but delicious.  He almost finished his entire plate.  I loved it and the next time I'm back in Charlotee I'll have to come back and have a burger!",

In fact, our server was so slammed when we were sat that the host even came by to get us started. Service here was phenomenal. I was genuinely impressed. I had the almond milkshake to start. It was better than I had hoped. Thick and flavorful. For being a busy night, I was happy the shake came out so fast. Since spending the day hoping from place to place sampling local restaurants, we were starting to get full. We shared the bad ass burger and tots. This burger has bacon ground in with the beef as well as fried bacon on top. Although indulgent....wow was it good. The tots were perfectly cooked and crispy. I would have eaten more of them, but someone had a heavy hand in the salt. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I want to come back here. Perfect service, amazing food. The only downfall was the added salt. A bacon burger doesn't need added salt and the tots were crunchy with extra salt. Maybe its a southern thing....",

Also as many others pointed out the restaurant layout is horrible, tables way closer to each other and a very loud and obnoxious setting if you are seated anywhere near out of control children.  Our waitress was a-ok but in my book all of this is forgiven is the food delivers which sadly in my it did not.  I ordered a burger offered as an outside the menu item with a jalapeno bagel instead of the bun (big mistake what was I thinking in retrospect) and it was supposed to come with salsa.  The pattie itself was undercooked even though the waitress had prompted me not to order medium rare bc the quality of the beef they have no is not the same as it used too (I mean thanks for the tip lady but if I'm the mgr and hear that wow), anyway so I ordered medium, but got a pretty pink one anyway which any other day I'd actually would have enjoyed; however to me it seemed that this one was still frozen in the mid.  Again I hope this was an isolated incident, the rest of my party actually had enjoyed their food so I will be back for a 2nd try, this group has after all proven to be very successful here in Charlotte.",

They play fast and loose with the term \"burger\" here, with a bacon-encrusted chicken sandwich, portabella melt & pork burger all falling under the moniker of the usually ground beef based sammy. Prices usually between $8-11; includes a side (indulge your inner Napoleon Dynamite & do the tots).  Build your own burger or go with the Frenchie (Turkey burger, brie, apple, bacon), Sam I Am (pesto, ham, fried egg) or any other over-the-top sounding selection on the menu. Jalapeno bacon? Bacon mayo? Yes please x2!!! The milkshakes are terrific, but a little on the pricey side, IMO. Pretty good tap beer selection. Fun atmosphere. Usually pretty crowded, even with outdoor seating. Ocassional celebrity sightings (I've seen Fred Couples & Jay Bilas here on separate occasions). A really fun place, with some of the most unhealthy burgers you could ask for.

When we got our food everything tasted spot on and was totally delicious! One of the best burgers that I've ever had with a great homemade fresh taste. I also love is that they use hormone free beef to make their patties; this really puts my mind at ease when eating red meat and so few places have an emphasis on such high quality ingredients.

    "text": "I've eaten here a couple times and while the food is always decent it just never is a very comfortable experience. They carry a good selection of specialty burgers and the beer specials will usually run around 3-4$. With the raging trend of burger bars/restaurants over the past few years this one is probably mid range at best. One of the things that always bugs me about this particular location is that parking is just about non-existent. They have a small lot and most patrons have to resort and walk it a couple blocks to get in during their rush hours. Once you are inside, the actual space they have is pretty cramped. It feels like you are always elbow to elbow with whoever is sitting next to you even if they aren't at your table or booth. That makes it hard on the servers to dance around and fill everyone's orders, although, they do manage well. The last thing that I'd say that \"grinds my gears\" about this spot is the noise level. With it drawing in a lot of the local families in the area it seems like there is usually more noise than most sit down places deserve. The concrete floors and large glass windows kinda of box all that noise in and you have to raise your voice to have a conversation with people at you table. I guess I'd recommend this place for take out if you are in the area and really wanted a burger but for a nice sit-down lunch or dinner it's just not comfortable.",

I also enjoy the Mama Ricotta's burger (huge cut of mozz cheese and thick tomato on top of the burger).  The Sam I Am burger is also fantastic.    I am not a fan of the sweet potato fries here, but many in my group tend to like them.  The \"make your own salad\" always seems to win with the ladies, and it is about as customizable as you could possibly make it.  The place can get very crowded during rush hour, so we almost always try to be very early or very late so we don't have to wait as long.    The place is also pretty kid friendly, as the atmosphere is always loud and noisy anyways.  It is a bit cramped though, so don't bring all your baby gear with you!",

I recommend the \"Frenchie\", a turkey burger with melted brie cheese, sliced and grilled granny smith apples, and applewood smoked bacon. The unique flavor combinations are a big plus here, as well as the laid back atmosphere. It's a bit pricey, but the food is consistent. The service is a bit slow and inattentive, but friendly nonetheless. As long as you have a little extra time to spare, this place is great, 4 stars.   P.S, there is usually a wait time, so for large groups definitely call ahead, or plan to eat during slower business hours.",

You can literally put anything on your burger that you want, so every time I go I create the perfect burger. Anything from avocado to a fried egg, and any kind of sauce you can think of. Every night they have a different beer special, and usually a different burger special, but I always create my own, like I said, it's perfect. Though, if they ever have the Kobe beef burger special, it's a must. And to top it all off, you can get chips, fries, sweet potato fries, and my favorite, tater tots. It is hard to give this place enough praise, I just can't imagine going anywhere else to get a burger.",

Super creamy and cheesy with just a few other ingredients to compliment the flavors. I have been dying to sit outside, unfortunately every time I get there the patio is full and I'm usually way to hungry to sit around and wait. The most recent time around I ordered the portabella burger with pimento cheese. MMMMMM. I want to go back and maybe try some of the desserts and maybe finally get my chance to sit on the patio!",

    "text": "Went for lunch on a Sunday and other than the fact that you can't order a Bloody Mary before noon, everything was great.   The Banh Mi burger was amazing and I already know I'll find myself craving this tasty burger soon. The Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids was a heart attack on a plate, yes, but so, so good! The sweet potato fries rock!   The best part is that we had excellent service on top of a great meal. Our waitress was nice and attentive. When we explained to her that we recently moved to North Carolina, hints why we didn't know that you can't order a cocktail to accompany your early lunch on the Lord's day, she welcomed us and told the manager who promptly came to our table to greet us. The manager sent us a complimentary banana pudding which was incredible (order the banana pudding!!!) and sealed the deal...we'll be back!! After 12:00 pm of course.   UPDATE: Not going to remove a star, but the second visit was not quite as nice. We went to Big Daddy's on Friday night with out of town guests and the food was very good, but this time the service was not so good. Our waitress was actually very nice, but the very same manager who so kindly welcomed us and gave us free banana pudding last time was quite rude.   I received a coupon by email after signing up for Big Daddy's \"email club\" or whatever it is, which was the recommendation of said manager at the last visit. When I asked if it is possible to use the coupon by showing the email on my phone, the manager came over and gave me a full lecture about how I need to print the coupon and rudely implied that I would try to use the coupon again to screw him out of a $4 appetizer. Seriously?? I am not 16 and claiming its my birthday to get a free dessert! I simply asked if it was possible to be \"green\" and use the electronic version of the coupon. It would have been much easier to just say no. I can do without the lecture. So that was an awkward end to what was supposed to be a nice evening with our guests.   Moral of the story: great food, angry manager, so please print your coupon and hope they recycle.",

The bar was not 100% stocked yet and the kitchen was VERY SLOW with our order... but we were willing to cut them some slack since they had only been open a couple of days.  However, our server and his manager definitely took care of us and made the extra effort to really make us happy.  To compensate for their shortcomings, they gave us a complimentary appetizer and a free round of beers.   The meat eaters in our house love the burgers and those of us who do not eat red meat have great options with their homemade Black Bean burger, Turkey burgers, and Chicken breast sandwiches.   They also have some great \"build your  own salad\" options. They have great pimento cheese, french onion dip, and homemade ketchup.  In terms of phyiscal layout, I personally prefer the Ballantyne location over the East Blvd location - its more open and there is more space to spread out and feel comfortable.  (The East Blvd location has too many tables packed in too close together and you feel like you're on top of neighboring patrons.) While they are still working out the kinks at Ballantye, they get an \"A\" for effort.  We will definitely be going back and recommending it to our friends as well!",

Place can be a little loud but it's ok. Not really too kid friendly. But all in all I give 4 stars. They would have received 5 stars if their waitstaff showed more customer service skills. All  3 times I have visited the hostess didn't greet us as we walked in or out of restaurant. The waitstaff didn't bother to check on us much. On this last visit my glass of water sat empty for most of my meal. Not only do we pay for our food we also pay our servers to give us good customer service. My boyfriend and I always leave a good tip even for bad service. Everyone has their bad days.",

    "text": "I love Bad Daddy's. I've been five or six times, and I've enjoyed it each time. I'm pretty basic when it comes to burgers - I usually get the Build Your Own Burger on Texas Toast, a medium patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mustard. I've always gotten the tater tots as a side and I've never been disappointed.  The last time my sister and I went, we each did a small Build Your Own Salad as an appetizer. In the past, we've tried the wings and the homemade potato chips as appetizers and weren't really impressed. The salads were yummy and we'll do that again. We also tried the milkshakes for dessert and loved them - I got the Oreo and she got the Chocolate and Peanut Butter one.  All in all, I highly recommend Bad Daddy's and it's one of my favorite places in Charlotte. The parking is terrible though so that's why I took off a star. We usually try to go for an early or late dinner to beat the craziness and that usually works. I'm looking forward to going to Bad Daddy's again soon!",

There was so much lettuce surrounding the burger I was able to eat it like any other burger!  I subbed my fries for salad (+$2) and you get to add 7 toppings like bacon and avocado...or in my case DOUBLE AVOCADO!  They definitely can cater to anyone so if you haven't been, go!  #keto #paleo",

We coupled this with the tater tots and another great choice.   We chased this down with some local brews and we were stuffed which is a bummer because they were sporting a Peach Cobbler Milk Shake which, while tempting, we just had no room left!   Definitely recommend and we'll return!",

    "text": "Despite living so close to the original Bad Daddy's this was my first visit to this location.  What usually scares me off is the parking situation.  But this time I got here at 11:30 and figured parking shouldn't be that bad.  Wrong.  Apparently the only time when parking is decent here is when they are closed.    But it wasn't that busy inside.  The bar was empty and all of the bar tables were available except one.  I started at the bar.  Seating at the bar is akward.  The bar itself is too high and it would make eating difficult.   So I moved to one of the bar tables.    It's been a while since my last visit to a Bad Daddy's so I realized they had changed their menu again.  My server was very helpful in explaining the menu and their special burger for the day.,  But I decided to be somewhat healthy and get a salad, Stella's Greek salad which is one of my favorite salads.    I also had a beer.  Bad Daddy's has a great selection of Charlotte and NC beers on tap.  The big 4 in Charlotte were represented (OMB, NoDa, Triple C, Birdsong) as well as one from Lonerider, Highlands and possibly a few others.    The salad was wonderful as always with chopped lettuce, kalamata olives, cukes, radishes and a light vinagrette.  The chicken was just a tad bit dry.  Still, Bad Daddy's is always consistently good.  The staff gets 5 stars on all of my visits.  The cons at this location are the bar height, the lack of seating space and the lack of parking.  If you can get by those, you'll enjoy yourself here.",

I lived in Charlotte for a bit and this was a frequent stop for me. I came here at least once a week. The very first time I had a burger with an egg on it was here at Bad Daddy's. The burgers here are easily going to be one of the best burgers you'll ever have. I know that's how it is for me.   Not craving a burger? No problem- you can build your own sandwich. I built my own chicken sandwich which was succulent and juicy. You can see from the pic I posted in this review that the bacon just looks crispy and delicious.   The service here is on point. The wait staff are extremely attentive and granted you will not be disappointed at all.   It's a perfect location, just the only thing that's a hit is the parking, but I usually park across the street next to Caribou.    If you are craving one of the best burgers you'll ever put in your mouth you MUST check out Bad Daddy's!",

If you want giant portions, decadent menu options, and leaving the restaurant feeling like you need to unzip your pants...Bad Daddy's is your place. Parking is a little hectic, but that's because it's always busy. I went to the original location in Charlotte on New Year's Day with a giant hangover and a need for grease. We got an order of the Truffle Parmesan fries to split for an appetizer, which were out of this world! I love Truffle Oil, and Bad Daddy's does not sprinkle it on these bad boys.  The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and joked around with us. He offered up some awesome selections, which I'm working on trying each time I visit. I tried the  Pittsburgher*. The menu description goes as followed \"Topped with housemade American cheese, spicy garlic ketchup, leaf lettuce, tomato, onion and topped with shoestring fries\". A side of tater tots came with it, and I was sold. The burger was on the bland side, but with all the fixings it didn't ruin my experience. My friend got the \"Sam I Am\" Burger, which has pesto and a friend egg on it. I'll be honest, I have to get that next time...it was out of this world! The staff is great, the menu is awesome, and you won't leave hungry!",

Nachos and fried pickles were the lucky chosen ones and we chose well!  The nachos were huge! This is not your mama's nachos - heaping scoops of sour cream and guacamole, ground beef chili, black beans, onions, queso sauce and tomatoes all added up to me being very, very happy. I did have to add alot of Texas Pete since there weren't any jalapenos, so next time I'm going to ask for them!  The fried pickles were good but not great - they're strips not chips, and they were just a little too thin for our tastes. As my girlfriend said, \"I need more pickle\" but the batter was one of the best we've tried!  I got a specialty drink off the menu - some Blue Devil concoction and it tasted like a gobstopper. Needless to say, it was awesome and a full glass worth of fun for $8!  We agreed we're going back soon for the burgers (the Frenchie looks awesome!) and fries to see if they live up to the hype!",

I know that Charlotte is being overrun with gourmet burger bars and the only thing outnumbering these are churches and condos with no buyers, but Big Daddy's was one of the first to bring this town outside-the-box burgers.  My favorites?  Sam I Am (grass-fed beef burger with fried egg, pesto and rosemary ham), The Frenchie (turkey burger, brie, apples, applewood smoked bacon and garlic mayo) and the Cantina 1511 (black bean burger, green chilies, cheddar, monterey jack, avocado and chipotle ranch).  The tater tots are crispy (albeit greasy, but it's a burger joint, for crissakes!), the sweet potato fries delicious and at one point they served fries that were fried in duck fat--the nectar of the gods--on the weekends.    The Bad:  you need a Doppler radar to forecast when you might be able to find a seat here.  I guess that the crowd proves that the food is really, really good, though.    The Ugly:  how you feel after you eat a burger and tater tots.",

If you're a burger fan, you should go here.  The burgers here are consistently the best in Charlotte from my experience, and I have tried a lot of the \"Charlotte's best burger\" restaurants.  If you have a negative experience here, I urge you to try again.  If you know of a better burger place (please don't say Liberty), please let me know.  It's always busy here, so expect to wait around for 30-40 minutes.  Thanks.",

    "text": "I've been to Big Daddy's Burger Bar 3x now.  The 1st time it was so loud & we were scrunched at the bar.  The burger menu I found to be too extensive to make a reasonable decision.  Had a regular cheeseburger.  It was a generous portion & definitely enough for not only me but one of my sisters to share.  Added a plain chocolate shake.  Watched it being made & it was standard vanilla ice cream, Hershey's chocolate syrup & milk.  It was thick but other then that nothing I couldn't make at home.  It was not as impressive as the wow factor others seem to tout as a reason to go.    Next visit I had the Black Bean Burger w/Tater Tots.  The Tater Tots had just the right amount of crisp & crunch.  Love that oil taste when you bite into them.   The Cantina 1511 Burger was a mess to eat.  Could taste & see the avocado dripping out w/each bite.  Where was the chipolte ranch?  Did not seem to be present on this burger.  The taste was all about the black bean patty & bun sticking to the top of my mouth that caused me to continually hydrate.  Next I tried the Buffalo Burger w/onion strings on top.  Again generous portion but where was the flavor?  Expected that the bbq sauce & onion strings that there were be big flavor.  Not to be found.  Big Daddy's is a friend fav so will continue to try & build a burger that has that bite that I'm searching for.",

Most burgers give you a piece or two, not Bad Daddy's.  It was loaded with 2 kinds of bacon and plenty of it.  I loved the jalepeno bacon by the way.  The burger was moist and cooked to perfections.  I had the onion straws and they were a great change from the traditional french fries.  I can't wait to go back again.  Luck for me it's here in Charlotte and I travel here often for business.

    "text": "I finally had the opportunity to actually sit and enjoy the food at Big Daddy's and I can't wait to go back. Until this point, I have been forced to survive on take-out Big Daddy's brought home by my hubs. Of course, he always brings home at least one of my favorites - sweet potato fries, fried pickles, or a milkshake, but the food tastes even better right from the kitchen.   My good friend and I decided to have a girls' lunch with three of our little people. We waited a few minutes for a table outside (the inside seemed a little too loud for chit chat and it was a gorgeous day!) and were instantly greeted by a super nice server. Although I have eaten food from Big Daddy's I had never held that large menu in my hand and was initially overwhelmed a bit - food, drink, food, drink? Ahhh! There was a little too much information to process so I settled on a glass of water and an order of fried pickles for the table. Almost before I could take a look back at the menu, the pickles appeared as if by magic. It truly seemed like a mere 2 minutes passed before our server took our order and the pickles and five plates appeared at our crowded table.   The pickles were the perfect way to start our meal but I have to admit that my friend and I faltered miserably when the time came to order our food. Pathetically, we both ordered the same salad - the Texicana - because it really sounded amazing. Chopped greens, black beans, corn, shredded tortilla chips, and chicken... doesn't that sound like a great Saturday afternoon meal? Our girls were more adventurous - one split the salad with me and ordered a side of fries (I like her style), another child ordered the chicken fingers - they looked and tasted great, and the third child ordered sliders. The sliders came out a little bit over done but I'm sure it is hard to cook those little burgers for the kiddos.   If you are looking for a family friendly restaurant, pay attention: The kids meals were served with a huge side of fruit - I would bring my children back to this restaurant simply because I was so impressed with the side of fruit - there must have been six different types of fruits arranged on a decent sized plate. A healthy mom's dream... The side of fruit totally offset the plate of fried pickles that started off the meal - I am sure of it.   We ordered a milkshake to take home to dad - my turn to be the one bringing home the take-out ... I ordered him the chocolate caramel milkshake - it was a special that day and it was delicious. I have had a very hard time finding a decent milkshake since moving to Charlotte and this is the best I have found so far. I am looking forward to enjoying the patio again - and hopefully being a little more adventurous with the menu!",

    "text": "I should have gone in with zero expectations but alas, I did not. I have read so many fabulous reviews of Big Daddy's and decided to check it out for myself before the Panthers game yesterday.   I was surprised that we easily found a parking place in the back of the restaurant and was practically shocked when we were seated right away! The restaurant itself is pretty tiny and the tables are alarmingly close together. The beer selection is strong but pretty pricey for a burger joint and their house brew isn't anything special at over 3 bucks so I would pay the extra to get something you know you are really going to like. I ordered the Cantina 1511 black bean burger  with onion straws and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with tater tots.   Our food came out really quickly and I was pleasantly surprised by the huge portion sizes. My burger came with avocado, green chilies, cheese, and chipotle ranch. The burger was good. That's it. It wasn't fabulous and I was not blown away. My boyfriend's burger came with six pieces of bacon, cheese, and baconnaise and literally screamed bacon but it really was not that fantastic either. However, we really enjoyed our sides. The onion straws were very crispy and came with a great chipotle sauce and the tater tots came with Big Daddy sauce which was amazing!  I literally could not control myself from finishing off my onion straws and diving into my boyfriend's tater tots!  Big Daddy's is a really unique burger joint with a great selection of side dishes but as for the burger, my favorite Charlotte burger joints are in no danger of being replaced.",

    "text": "This is my favorite burger in Charlotte.  I never realized before moving to the South that most places around here cook your burger almost well done whether your like it or not.  I appreciate that Big Daddy's asks me and I always say medium which means it comes out juicy and delicious.  I can't comment on all the things on the menu cause I always get the same thing, burger cooked medium with white cheddar, avocado, and mayo.  It's heavenly.  The burger is just juicy enough and the toppings are great.  Tater Tots are a must but the sweet potato fries are good too.  My husband has ordered the Bacon extravaganza burger (that's not the real name) and said it was almost too much bacon, so maybe steer clear and get something else if you don't LOVE LOVE LOVE bacon.  There's a great beer selection and the patio is a nice place to sit on a sunny day.  Sometimes it gets a bit crowded but the food is good so I'll wait!",

Next, I have never been to a restaurant that allows you to custom create your side salad that comes with your meal, what a deal and quite delicious! Third. the burger... MY GOODNESS!!!! I had the Mama's Ricotta Burger and it was fantastic. I was a little confused by the name, because it has mozzarella cheese not ricotta cheese, but it did not disappoint. The mozzarella went perfectly with the pesto and the burger was made exactly to order (medium). Some friends tried the Frenchie and they raved about it, so I am sure that is good too. We loved our waitress, a nice combo of friendly, accommodating of large groups, but also not too pushy or overbearing. All in all I say Bad Daddy's is a success. Definitely check it out!",

The bartender was friendly and took my order.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids with the house made potato chips as my side.  I also ordered some onion straws as fried onions are one of my weaknesses.  The onions straws came out pretty quickly.  They had a nice spicy bite to them.  They had a chipotle ranch dipping sauce, but really didn't need it.    My burger came out when i was about half way through the onion straws.  It was enormous and looked delicious.  It was almost too big to get my mouth around, but I managed.  It was very juicy with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion along with the two types of bacon, cheese and baconaise.  The house made chips were OK, but I'd probably opt for a different side next time.  Over all a very good burger and good service.  I'm definitely putting Big Daddy's on my list of places to go back to again.",

    "text": "My roommate had heard of Big Daddy's a while back but had never gotten around to trying it, so when the place we planned to patronize for lunch was closed for Labor Day we ended up heading over to give them a try (once we figured out which way we were supposed to be going). When we pulled up the place looked packed. The lot was full, as was the street parking for a few blocks. No problem, it was a nice day and even though we counted on a fairly sizable wait that was fine. Well, it would have been fine if we had actually had a sizable wait, but we were seated in less than 20 minutes. Nice start, BDs.  I stuck to water, but I did take a glance at the beer menu. I must say it was not too shabby, but then again, any beer menu with Shiner Bock on tap can't possibly be shabby not can it?  Like many other \"gourmet\" type burger places, Big Daddy's has a variety of loaded, combination-style offerings, but they are remarkably flexible about letting you switch their creations around. Don't want meat? Get a black bean burger under all those fancy toppings. Feeling a touch rugged? Try switching to buffalo. Just kicking it mild? Chicken sandwich for you. You can choose your bun, your cheese, your toppings and your meat, not to mention the side that goes with it. Some substitutes/add ons are gratis, some will cost you some change, but let it not be said that you can't get what you want.  I ended up with the Cantina 1511 Burger, a black bean burger topped with cheddar, monterey jack, avocado, green chilis and chipotle ranch, but I swapped the patty to beef and nixed the avocado. To go with I chose the sweet potato fries, which came with whole grain honey mustard. Everything was phenomenal, especially the fries, though I feel like the chipotle ranch sauce could have used a little more kick (although to be honest, I think that of just about everything).  My companion did it up Italian style with the Mama Ricotta's burger, which sports a beef burger, mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes and olive oil, on a wheat roll. He got the housemade chips with pimento cheese. The burger was tasty, however, one section was a bit too pink for either of our liking (we ordered both burgers Medium). The chips were crunchy, flavorful and top notch.  I will definitely be returning here next time I get a yearning for a creative burger. Or maybe even just a good beer and some fries.",

Salads are good too if you're not into burgers and I like that you can make your own sandwich if you don't like their choices.

    "text": "Love me some Bad Daddy's!   The homemade chips are one of the items that keeps me coming back and looking forward to having a lunch meeting at either location.   The burgers/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!  The wings fit well on the \"expected\" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef.   The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.  The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar/dairy laden enjoyment.   Outdoor seating is phenomenal and you really can't go wrong on a spring day on East Blvd while being outside. The hightop communal tables at East Blvd cause a bit of a backup/walking issues. Beware if you are trying to get out while its busy.   Service is always friendly and fast. These guys are doing a great job with their entire chain of restaurants across the Queen City. Hats off, ladies and gents.   Great Charlotte staple.

Upon entering, we saw the servers working feverishly delivering food to the patio tables. The steps are somewhat slippery and stacked. We were praying they did not slip and bust their heads. Anyway, there was a 15 min wait which was not bad. Per our server's recommendation, we ordered the fried pickles. They were cut long versus traditional chips and came with chipotle ranch dressing. We really liked that they were lightly breaded, but prefer half the sodium.  For burgers, we enjoyed the turkey and Carolina burgers.  I liked the homemade slaw and the chili with beans was lukewarm at best. Still pretty tasty.  Sweet potato fries were yummy.  Maybe next time we will try the spike milkshakes or dessert.   Service was decent and we will keep this place on our dining rotation, but keep in mind the tight parking.",

    "text": "My husband and I been to Big Daddy's for burgers, but we really love them for their breakfast, which is more low key.  They are one of the few restaurants serving breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday, and they are always packed when we go.    Their coffee is good and strong, and there are enough options on the menu to please everyone.  We have tried the breakfast wrap, sausage biscuits, pancakes, and skillets, but the wrap remains our favorite.  They have a new chef as of early 2011 and the wrap is even better now -- the black bean cake is crispier, the sausage is now crumbled, and the salsa is tastier.  Try the grits as a side with added cheese - it's absolutely yummy!    Their service is also really good - attentive and pretty quick.  I love the outdoor patio when the weather is warm, too.  Big Daddy's is a great value and I highly recommend you give them a try for breakfast.",

Yep, you got that right, a metal bolt in her nachos.  The manager said it came off the fryer.  The manager comped our meal, which was the right thing to do, but whoa.  On the other end, I had the basic burger with cheddar, bland and boring.  I love a good burger and this just wasn't it.  Yes, a basic burger I did not expect to be wowed, but I was hopeful for a good.  It was boring, had little taste, and with all the burger places around, I need to be wowed.  Five Guys this is not.  The nachos, aside from the added metallic objects included, were bland as well.  Nachos are to have flavor and it just wasn't there.  Skip this one, there are other places to go.",

Both were cooked perfectly and the place has the bun to burger ratio down perfectly.   Some places give you a thin bun that soaks through; others a massive role that won't fit in your mouth.  Bad Daddy's was perfect.    Both burgers were juicy, but not excessively so (that's the worst - hot grease) and both had a great, salty and smokey taste.  Caution: the Bad Ass Burger comes with fried bacon.   It's delicious but eating the burger with the full helping they provide will overwhelm the taste of the actual burger.   Plus, it's A LOT of food.      My appetizer salad came quickly, followed soon thereafter by the burgers.   The servers were all very nice and informed.  The meal was paced nicely.   We sat outside.  Frankly, inside seemed loud.  Great beer selection.     It was a terrific find and sits in a lovely part of Charlotte.",

Ordered a Badass Burger, Bacon burger on steroids and the parmesan fries.  The fries were extremely salty, I had a few bites and only because I was starving from not eating all day. I don't know if it's usually like that or just a fluke, but I will never order those again.  I ate the bacon cheeseburger, it was very good even with the overdose of bacon. When I read the descriptions I had to try it. My date had the Badass burger and she was in heaven. This fact means that I will have to come back. The burger is huge, but not something that most people won't be able to finish.   Personally, it wouldn't be on my list of places to return to, but if my date wants to come back I will. It has a popular reputation around town, and I'm glad to have tried it at least once.",

    "text": "Ordered from here via Postmates last night and was very disappointed. I ordered the Truffle Fries which were good. Pretty standard that you can get from most places you order them from. I also ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Bacon on top of bacon slathered with more bacon, how could you go wrong? I was very specific in my order that I didn't want any lettuce, tomato, or onions and that I would like my pickles on the side and NO SOGGY BUN. I thought it was genius when my Postmates arrived and said the restaurant recommended putting my bun in a separate container so it wouldn't get soggy. Why has no other restaurant thought of this? Why didn't I think of this? I was excited to dig in until I opened the container with my burger and found there to be no bacon. NONE! Not one slice. So I thought well maybe it is under the cheese. NOPE. Not one slice out of the 6 pieces that were supposed to be present. I would've been happier had they forgot the beef and only gave me a bacon sandwich. Seriously! I was super sad and frustrated. All I had was a burger that I could've gotten from any burger place with some cheese on top and a side of mayo with bacon in it. I don't even like mayo that much but it was all I had to get the taste of bacon on my burger. To top it off I'm pretty sure my burger was medium rare rather than medium and the taste was ehhh.   Sadly my side order of fruit was the best thing I got. Very fresh and satisfying. Wish I had more of it to wipe my bacon blues away.   Long story short at a place with burger bar in the title, and even more so from a burger with bacon in the title I expect the burgers to be top notch, made how you order them and with everything that's supposed to come on it unless you specify otherwise.",

After ordering, it took them 45 minutes to get the food at the table. (Queso, 4 sliders and 2 Burgers) The sliders (2 of them already cold when we tried them) were not good at all (after the first bite, nobody eat more of the chicken one... so salty), and queso with chips to share. SO SALTYYYY AGAIN! We had less than half...  I couldn't see my waiter so I told another waitress that the chicken sliders where not good, and she said \"Fine\" (I drunk 1'5 glasses of water to get my mouth free of the saltiness and try to have a better bite) I wanted to invite my 2 friends for dinner in a nice place, but I guess I wasn't lucky tonight.  To finish, like my waiter had disappear AGAIN, I asked another waitress to put all under my card; her answer was \"I'm not your waitress\"...  and the only good and the right thing in the whole night, they discounted the appetizers... the rest is History... Never again!  If you don't have enough staff to Serve, don't open a restaurant!!!",

It looked small but once he began to dig in, the veggies were piled high under the fresh greens and not iceberg greens. The only thing that disappoints me is the onion straws which has a batter that is extremely salty to me. That's why I still have them 5 stars. They traded my onion straws for fresh tator tots and I went to town.",

We were seated in the tented and heated area outside when it was about 20 degrees outside and we still had to keep winter coats on the entire time. Our service wasn't amazing, it was crowded but our waiter was on the slow side. The food was good but wasn't amazing either. They make a good burger but there are places in Charlotte that make better. They do have some unique burgers though. Not my favorite place but I'd go back.",

We also felt rushed to leave while everyone else appeared to be having a wonderful time enjoying themselves and not being rushed at all. IDK it was something about us I guess. We're a pretty laid back family so I wouldn't know what it was that rubbed them the wrong way. We weren't rude about the burger, we weren't upset at all just wanted a well done burger so there was no disgruntled on our part. Would I go back? I mean maybe there's a very slight chance who knows. I did like the fact that they had 2 teenagers working as hosts. Always nice to see teenagers learning the importance of hard work.",

The first time we came here we both ordered the cantina burger with fries (I substituted a fried black bean patty in).  The patty had good consistency but lacked seasoning. Luckily, the second time around the patty was crispy and seasoned. The burgers come with fresh toppings and a side. I would go with the tater tots, the fries I got the first time around weren't very special.   I also signed up for the email subscription ( I got a free app out of it) and forgot to use it till the last minute. I had also forgotten to print it out for redemption but the manager oked it luckily. We grabbed the backyard bbq nachos since it was large and unique. They had really good toppings minus the \"queso\", it felt more like processed cheese than actual queso. Trust me, I eat a lot of cheese.   We will be back to try out some more burgers.",

Busy for lunch so we snagged some seats at the bar. Liz (I think. Have to get better at this) was very attentive throughout the meal.   We started with nachos...because we are addicted to nachos. They were good, nothing really special. Great guac. After that massive appetizer I felt like I needed some lettuce so I got the Texicorn Salad. PSA: Not actually healthy at all-- fried chicken and mayo based dressing.  I am not kidding when I say I made 3 meals out of that salad throughout the weekend though. Huge! Tasted really fresh and I loved the dressing. Would get again. Boyfriend got the burger that was on special and he really enjoyed it. Huge as well. I stole a couple of his fries and they were very good.  I definitely want to go back and try a sandwich-- as well as enjoy the patio!",

The parking lot was packed and we knew we'd made a good choice but no clue we'd literally just hit the jackpot on Burger Bars in Charlotte! This is my kind of place....tons of burger options with your choice of fries or tots. Oh yes, sign me up every time.   We started with an order of the buffalo wings. Shut up. They came out pipping hot....literally right out the pan. We got both ranch and blue cheese (what!?) and enjoyed every bite! They aren't too spicy but have a great amount of flavor. I'd recommend them and absolutely order them again.   For burgers, Derrick tried the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids and I opted for the Cantina. Soooo me being jealous that his burger came with 6 pieces of bacon (Mmmm....bacon) I added jalapeno bacon and jalapenos to mine. These really are some of the best burgers in town. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth with each bite. Not joking...they are that good.   Guys, seriously. This is how a burger should be....stacked up with toppings so big you can barely get your mouth open enough for a good bite! Yums. Add to that tots and fries and you might as well just consider the rest of your day a bust....because you will need a nice long nap!",

I've literally seen my food come out and sit on the counter behind the bar for 10 plus minutes before anyone even checks to see who's order it is. If you ask the bartender (especially the guy at lunch with the beard and the Union Jack boxers (because I can see his underwear) to check for you he says he's really busy and he will do it soon. :) I already paid!

    "text": "We have eaten at BDBB 3 or 4 times over the past six months.  It's a little bit of a drive for us, but if we lived closer we would go much more often.    We usually start with the deep fried pickles.  If ordering for just 1 or 2 people be careful to not fill up on these before your burgers arrive as the portion deceiving.  A note on these, the pickles are sliced longwise, they are not \"chips\" or spears.  The breading is nice (instead of a batter) so you don't end up with hot pickle juice buying your mouth!  If I am trying to be healthy I will go for the Turkey Burger and Brie (I call it that - I just cant order the \"Frenchie\" :-)   But most times we throw caution to the wind and get the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids.  Bacon, Bacon and more Bacon...  If I had a complaint about Bad Daddy's it would be the same that I have with nearly every burger joint.  It doesn't matter what temp you order your burger, it will usually be medium well to well done.  We never have room for dessert so I can't tell you anything about it.  Avoid \"peak times\" as there isn't a comfortable place to sit or stand if you have to wait.  I guess prices are subjective.  We were fine with paying $11.50 for a good size burger with Bacon and a side.",

I like everything about Bad Daddy's except for the burgers, which was to be the star of our lunch.    I'm sitting here writing this review wishing I had just ordered a spiked milkshake.  It's over 100 degrees outside and that's definitely what I should have done.  I ordered the Bad Ass Burger with Chips.  The burger was absolutely dripping in a thick oily grease.  I ended up having to put it on paper towels and tried to dry it out.  I ended up having to just stop trying and I split a burger with my bride... that one was single burger (patted down from grease) with avocado and bacon.  It was better but still lacking.    Here's the part that really stunk... we each ordered a burger and two diet cokes and the total was $30+$6 tip.  For $36, I could have had a better burger & coke.  I will go back but will need to try some different things.",

After drooling over the menu, I decided on the bacon cheeseburger on steroids minus the house made bacon mayo (mayonnaise freaks me out for some reason).    The only way I can describe my first bite is bacon heaven.  Jalepeno bacon, applewood smoked bacon, and bacon salt on the burger all combined into the perfect bite of burger.  The burger with fries came to $12 which is a steal in my opinion.    My only complaint (which isn't even a serious complaint and I'm not taking off a star for it) is that when I left, I felt like I was covered in grease, but it could be all the bacon grease seeping out of my pores.  It's not going to stop me from going back, though!!",

My 3 year old grandson has a severe nut allergy and my daughter who is a great advocate for her son and his allergies asked 3 different times about the oil and the orders we placed and the waiter assured us there weren't any nuts in any of them and he was correct about that. My grandson was sitting next to his mother who had ordered a tuna burger with cole slaw again it does not contain nuts but  half way through her meal she noticed an actual whole nut on her plate. We proceeded to call the manager over and I explained to him on a scale from 1 to 10 my grandsons nut allergy is a 10 if he had that nut on his plate and ate it it could have been fatal to him. The manager said he was sorry and it must have come from someone's salad plate and offered us a new Tuna burger which we declined. The manager was nice but it was quite obvious he did not grasp the seriousness of this mistake. He did not appear to be overly concerned. He did  not offer us any further compensation in any way and most disturbing he never came back to the table again to make sure the rest of the meal was uneventful or to assure us he will speak with his staff to make sure they understood the greatness of this mistake to ensure it never happened again to another customer. I can only assume the manager never followed through because he does not understand the severity of the mistake. It seems ridiculous that in this era he is running a family restaurant which has many children as customers and he may not be knowledgeable to the fact there is an epidemic of food allergies especially Nuts. There is more to running a good business than smiling and being courteous. If you decide to still eat here and have food allergies be very careful. I am hoping by writing this review the manager may now understand the seriousness of this error and educate himself and his staff on the importance of being very diligent when preparing customers meals.",

The menu itself has a variety of burgers to choose from including the southerner burger which has coleslaw and chili (my current favorite), and the Mama Ricotta's burger which is a True tribute to the restaurant that it was named after. That said, my True favorite (the burger with Guinness beer battered onion rings) was taken off of the menu. *sniff, sniff* You are missed dear burger!   The menu does have an assortment of chopped salads for all those meatless types, and there is a pretty decent beer selection too to wash everything down. Although, I have yet to find a beer that goes well with salad.

Positives:  Diverse and delicious burger choices; unique flavors you can't find at other places.  Good salads.  Great tots.  Great shakes.  Great patio for outdoor dining.  Casual place to have a great burger with friends.  Wait staff and bartenders work hard.  The positives far outweigh the negatives.",

    "text": "I can't say enough about Big Daddy's--definitely one of my top two or three Burger joints in Charlotte. Before getting to the food, it's worth mentioning that BD's is a great place to come for a beer. Lots of selection, lots on tap, and for great prices. They even had a deal a while back in which you could fill any glass (bring your own) for like $5, which was amazing. Sadly, I think they did away with that. Great outdoor seating lets you drink (or eat, or both) outside, and there's always a lively scene out there and indoors, especially on Thursdays and the weekends. I actually saw a whole lot of people there for brunch on saturday when I was driving by--never been that early but apparently it's good.   As for the food, it's awesome. Tons of different and original burgers, each prepared perfectly. My favorite is the western, which comes with sauteed onions, bbq sauce (amazing) and cheddar cheese. My girlfriend got a chicken thing with guacamole and hot sauce, and it was delicious. The fries and the other sides--pasta salad, slaw--were really good compliments too.   Definitely go back as much as I can. Pretty cheap and definitely an easy, quick experience if you need it to be. Check it out!",

    "text": "So Big Daddy's isn't really as disappointing as I initally made it sound. It was never bad in the first place, it just didn't live up to my overly meticulous expectations. The caveat about this place though is you have to find something that works for you; hence the endless amount of customization they offer....but at a premium of course. I'm still going to disagree with their credo; not everything on the menu is very very tasty. Not all items are worth a second chance.   The Buffalo Chicken sandwich. It was chicken, I'll give them that. As far as the hot buffalo sauce though, it was either just sprinkled or just plain non-existent. All you could taste was the overwhelming blue cheese.  The sides are still just sides. I can't say they're better than other chips, fries, tots, onion straws or mac N cheese I've had anywhere else. Tasty nonetheless.  And now the star of the show. My favorite burger, the Sam I Am. Oh how I do love thee. I didn't think I'd like ham on my burger, but dang it fits the formula perfectly. Now the pesto I can do without. I was never a big fan of pesto in the first place, but I wanted to give it an audition with the burger. Now that I have, I'm still not a big fan of pesto.  Management makes it a point to ensure customers are satisfied and I still appreciate that. I like the uniqueness they bring to the table, and the inventive burgers - although I might not like them all. You can't deny the fact that they strive to please and strive for perfection. With what seems like infinite ingredient combinations, I'm sure we can all find our piece de resistance eventually.",

    "text": "Went to Big Daddy's for a burger and some Trivia on Thursday night.  Great choice!  The location is great, right on East Blvd, and there is some parking lot space if it isn't too packed.  They have a great patio area and the inside is cozy sized.  On Thursday evening they had a few $2 beer specials which was nice.  I had the Frenchie burger, which is a Turkey burger with Brie and apples.  It was phenomenal.  I was hesitant to go with a Turkey burger since there were so many good looking beef options, but my server assured me I would not be disappointed.  I think the Brie really made it with it's buttery rich goodness.  The sweet potato fries were great as well.  Service was pretty good, I would have liked more water refills but other than that very attentive.  We stayed for Trivia, which was supposed to be at 9p but had technical difficulties that resulted in a later start.  Unlike the Ed's Tavern trivia I attended, this game was the real deal.  Cell phone cheaters were threatened with removal from the premises.  The trivia proctor, Kat, was very clear with her questions and the rules.  She had a wagering point system that added some spice to the game - felt like gambling!    Unfortunately we ended up at the bottom of the pack, but I could definitely see myself coming back for more trivia action and an awesome burger!",

    "text": "With so many reviews out on this place, I'm not sure what more I could add.  Yes, they make some tasty burgers and yes, there is a big variety to choose from- including a few chicken and veggie options.  I just can't gush over Big Daddy's because, even given all of the above, this place lacks any kind of star quality.  A little context here- this place occasionally makes the lunch rotation with my co-workers and I.  We hit it up when the consensus of the crew is that we're all OK with a \"less than healthy\" option and we don't mind a crowd.  If you've been here for lunch, you know parking is a nightmare.  The 2 tiny parking lots adjacent to the actual building are far too small to accommodate.  Everyone ends up parking street-side, and I mean WAY down the street.  If I were real-estate shopping I'd avoid this street for the Big Daddy's parkers alone.  I know these are the constraints we work within inside this particular neighborhood, but I often choose against the place for the sole reason I don't want my car dinged by some poor parallel parker or side-swiped by some boat of an SUV.  My other concern is the general attitude of the wait staff I have encountered here.  If there were a stereotype of server here it would be this: 20-something college girl looking more for where the party is that night than whether I got the right order.  I hate to overly-generalize but I've just seen it too much here, and it has been consistent.  Yes, service is generally snappy, but a little too snappy, only to later find the waitress taking her time talking to the table of college guys at the other end of the restaurant.  It's perhaps just a general lack of professionalism here- which is a departure from the owner's typical MO for servers at his other restaurants.  That said, the food here is generally good.  As for sides, you can pick your poison- tater tots, onion, or potatoes- either sweet or regular, either as chips or fries.  In my opinion, the chips deserve a look- they are house-made.  The onions are heavily battered and a little too stringy for my taste.  I also find the sweet potatoes rather tasteless.    Never had the milkshakes, but they look good.  There's also a pretty big beer selection here.  Note that this place tends to get busy when the weather is nice- the covered outdoor patio is like a siren call to the traffic on East Blvd.    Overall, quality burgers with options a-plenty, just a general attitude and poor parking situation that makes me say, \"Meh.  Take it or leave it.\"",
