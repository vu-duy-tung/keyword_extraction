That's not bad, I mean there IS the option of 1 or 2 stars BUT there is also the option of 4 - 5!  The quality of meat is good (Boars Head) as is the quantity on the sandwiches.  The breads range from good to \"used to be good but now it's stale\" and there is no excuse for selling a sandwich on stale bread!  The Club is close to my section of cubeville so, I generally make it there once a month or so but, if it were just a wee bit more consistent and a wee bit cheaper, I would definitely up the frequency of visits.",

The truth ended up as a large hunk of bread with some mushy breaded chicken, the smallest amount of some sort of sprinkle cheese, and perhaps some marinara. (I couldn't really tell, but the bread was a little reddish). McDonald's would have been more flavorful.",

The menu is big but not overboard, and there's always something that suits my mood.  Decently good value for what you get.

So by the time you get to the cashier and pass by the large variety of chips, your sandwich will be ready. The wait was around 15 minutes but I think it was worth it.

Actually the service was great, we were up in the area for the Carolina Fest - Labor day celebration - which was a part of the DNC week in Charlotte.  They didn't jack their prices up at all, and even though it was standing room only it took no longer than getting a sandwich at any other sandwich shop.  In fact it was still probably quicker than Penn Station.  If you are in the area (right off the green) and have a hankering for a quick bite you should try it.  I'll be back and I'm sure I'll have to up my rating to four stars.",

However, charging extra for every vegetable brought my sandwich to $10.50.  No meat just vegtables.  That was not ideal for a salad with bread.  Long wait and my friend who is not a vegetarian got the Italian sandwich with extra vegtables and his broke $11.00.  We did not order chips and drinks.  Not my ideal place.  There are other sandwich shops that we can get better vegtables sandwiches for $3 - $4 less.  It's nothing special for a vegaterian, just an average sandwich shop.  If you like lots of vegtables, I would go someplace else.    However, my friend said the Italian meat was very good.  He would also give it an average rating though.

I would only give it 3 stars, even though the Eggplant & Mozzarella Focaccia was the best ever. A few reasons:  * Lines get very long during lunch time, so if you are in a hurry to grab something before the meeting, forget it. The orders are taken pretty quickly, however, they are fulfilled painfully slowly! If they only hired another person to prepare the orders, they would not be losing so many customers who are in a hurry (and I tell ya, being one of them sucks!) * There are 50 different varieties of potato chips on display. None of them are \"baked\" variety.  * Very much empty space. I understand that the ownership wants to fill it with customers waiting for their orders, but still. A few more tables would be nice.  Overall, good experience. You can buy your food there and eat in the park. By the way, they are putting the Ice Skating Rink there right now! Yay.",

I got the impression that it was a deli with fresh ingredients, airy bread - overall quality food.  We ordered the chicken cordon bleu and the chicken grill sandwiches. Chip selection was awesome with a range for every taste. The sandwiches were, in a word, forgettable.  My breaded chicken cutlet was popped in the microwave before it was put on my sandwich, making the breading mushy and not appetizing whatsoever. Pair that with semi-stale bread and the sandwich was a lost cause. I only ate half of it before throwing the rest away. With the sandwich, chips, and tea coming to 10 bucks and some change, you can say I was a little disappointed.  Lesson learned that you can get a much fresher, more appetizing sandwich somewhere like Panera, for less money.",

    "text": "Was that a gunshot??? NO that was the sound of the bag lady at the Sandwich Club!!!  YES they have a great variety of sandwiches and CHIPS of all things.....My coworkers and I were here today for lunch.  I have been here many times despite the frosty service.  I love the reubens and the veggie burgers.  If you start going regularly get the card, where if you buy five you get one free.    The veggie burger is very good, you can get it on a pita instead of a big bun to make is a little healthier.  Delish!!!  One reflection on today's fruit:  I was laughing when my coworker threw her $2.95 fruit cup out saying that the cantelope tastes like dirt.  How could she be so finicky and silly?  But then I tried mine, yes she was right.  Blah.  I have to say the fruit is not always dirt-esque...I have had it before and it has been 'fine'.  Just beware.....on this day it was a total waste of money.  So what on earth is up with the bag lady?  I have only been able to get her to smile once, it was a fleeting experience.  But the most remarkable experience about the Sandwich Club is to watch her bag the sandwiches.  When the sandwich comes out of the kitchen, she rings you up and bags your sandwich (snapping the bag open with one hand with a GIANT SNAP).  It is quite the experience, and the food is reasonable, but be prepared to wait in line for a bit if you get there at peak times.  :-D",

I initially had a number of bad experiences with stale bread (unacceptable in a sandwich joint) and wrote this place off but some coworkers encouraged me to give their Veggie Burgers a try.  I will admit, their veggie burgers WERE pretty good.  I say \"were\" because, as I learned today when I went for lunch, they have discontinued their veggie burgers.  I thought about just leaving after finding that out but decided to stick it out and try something else, which ended up being the Eggplant Mozzarella Sandwich.  Big mistake.  The eggplant was severely undercooked and still had that rubbery texture that only uncooked eggplant can have.  In other words, it was inedible.  I also bought a lemon bar (which was overpriced to being with at $2.25) that featured a crust that tasted like raw dough.  Shame on me for giving this places so many chances, but after essentially throwing $10 in the garbage today, I'll never be back.    And while the terrible food is bad enough, I haven't even brought up the dismal customer service.  The two front of the house workers that are usually there will barely communicate with you--and you can forget a smile.  It is off-putting but something I could forgive if the food were good.  But it is not.  I hate to help send a business down the river, but, in all honestly, the sooner this place is out of business and a decent place opens up in its stead, the better.",

This is sadly the last location standing, as the locations in the Odell Building and 121 West Trade have both closed over the years and created a longer walk from my office in Hearst Tower.  The sandwiches themselves are the redeeming quality of this place, which I suppose is good seeing that it's a sandwich shop.  As expected with Boar's Head ingredients, the food quality is amazing (particularly their roast beef) and their breads in particular are delicious.  Along with closing their 121 West Trade location earlier this year, the business recently pared down the menu, and while I haven't had all of the sandwiches still on the menu, I've yet to try one that wasn't super tasty and the weekly special is usually good as well.  Fairly large variety of side items, from an array of chips to more healthy options.  Try to go later in the afternoon as the line during peak hours can seem endless, but they usually manage to get you through fairly quickly and with a minimum of fuss.  No one who works here will ever be accused of providing friendly customer service (if the older gentleman is behind the counter, you'll be lucky if he bothers to acknowledge you when you pay), but their goal is to get your order and get you out quickly with a tasty sandwich, and that's exactly what they do.",

The Sandwich Club usually has a long, moving line during peak lunch hours.  I like to go on an off hour to skip the line and have that much more time to enjoy my sandwich.  With 33 different sandwiches to choose from, you can't really go wrong at this place.  Pretty simple set up.  Come in, place your sandwich order, move on down the line, pick up chips (if you want them), pay and wait for your name to be called out.  There are a couple of places to sit and enjoy your lunch, or take your sandwich out to the Green and enjoy it outside (hopefully with good weather).",

I just went with the #1 Parkside and had no regrets. It was delicious! They also use Boar's Head meats which are top choice. Now I get to go back and decide if I want to work my way to some of the other tasty looking choices or stick with the goodness I had. Regardless, I'll be back.

    "text": "I keep trying to like this place, I really do. But it fails more times than not.   Today they had a special and I wanted pickles instead of cucumber, but they wanted to charge me extra for pickles. :(  I asked for extra mayo because they are SO light handed with their condiments. It is not even on half the bread. :(  The pickles were only on one half of my sandwich, of course not the side with the mayo.   Sadly, I did not notice until I was leaving that they had a rating of a 90. If I had seen that before, I would have just gone elsewhere to begin with.   Some of the people working there seem almost annoyed that customers are there. The man who either owns or manages it is pretty nice, but he is not rule, he is the exception.   Now that more and more places are opening, including Panera, where you can get exactly what they have for the same or lower price and have a better end experience, I would say Sandwich Club is a place to go if you have to...and if you do not mind a poor cleanliness rating. A 90 is pretty bad, IMO!",

    "text": "So many choices of good ingredients like sprouts, avocado and many more. All kinds of breads, wraps and other choices. The menu has over 40 different pre selected choices and you can also make your own sandwich. I usually take a look at the special sandwich of the week - which you can find posted just outside the entrance and by the counter where you order.   Even when there is a longer line, I find that the wait time is relatively quick. Typically I will pull out my phone and check a few emails while I wait, though I usually don't get very far.   Finally, this place has one of the best stamp card deals in uptown. If you work in the city and eat out frequently then you should take advantage of this. Get five stamps and get $5 off your next order. While it isn't completely free, most places are 10 stamps before the reward.",

Enter The Sandwich Club.   Long lines at lunch point to something great, and TSC is that something. I could gush over the flavor of almost all of their turkey sandwiches -- quality meat and cheese, creative combinations, and always served with a smile. Good specials, too! And they have a frequent customer card that earns you $5 off your purchase after you buy 5 sammies, so you feel like you're working towards a goal when you eat here 5 days in a row. Also, they heat up their sandwiches on request, so no worries about listeria for this preggo!  Another thing: you've never seen so many varieties of kettle-cooked potato chips in your life as you will find at TSC. So far, I haven't found a dud among the mix.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying the sandwich was super delicious. I ordered through YelpEat24 and had their #17, The Gobbler (it's like a thanksgiving meal on a sandwich - I added Havarti and had it on Sourdough). I walked from our local office to the restaurant, which was inconveniently located inside of another building, passed a security guard, off of Trade St. When I arrived, they said they had not received my order, and made me pay in cash. I had to work with YelpEat24 to get my money back, which they refunded in whole. When Yelp contacted the sandwich shop, they said I ordered it from the other location - WHAT? How would that even happen when I'm new to the area, ordered online, and followed the ON FOOT directions to your shop. 1000 nopes. When I arrived in the store, the cashier was not very friendly and was too busy flirting with the guy in front of me to assist me immediately (probably why she didn't \"receive my online order\", she barely listened to me). The sandwich itself was good and I received my order after only 2 minutes - SPEEDY (unless this WAS my order from online). The flavors were delicious, only thing was they could've spread the sandwiches ingredients out over the whole sandwich rather than throwing a scoop of stuffing in the middle and praying to the sandwich gods to spread it for them. I would give them a lower rating for my crappy experience, but the turkey was super fresh - so I cannot. 3 stars they get from me, could easily be 5 or 1 - I guess it depends on the day.",

I greatly appreciate that you can order from an on-line app ( I can't leave my desk for long) and you can pay when you get there.  I've eaten almost all the sandwiches they have, some more than once. I love that the chicken cutlet is...a cutlet, not a dried out, too big breast portion.  The deli meat is top notch, fresh and tasty, just sometimes the amount is a little lacking.  The chicken salad is good, not a mash of vege's and hardly any chicken, they could ease up on the mayo just a touch. The reward card is great, 5 stamps and $5 off your sandwich.  Awesome!! They just stopped serving soup, I guess because the weather is warming up but the soup was quite tasty. All in all, the food is good and the price for a sandwich is fair. My only complaint is they offer sprouts but haven't had them anytime I've added them to a sandwich...and I paid for non-existent sprouts.  Oh well.",

When you get to the counter,  they will know your order by the name when you gave when they took your order on the line. You pay for your sandwich and wait for it at the counter area.    The wait for the sandwich is usually no longer than 5 minutes after you pay.  The sandwich options are really good but you can also make your own.  The prices are about 7-8$ per sandwich without drinks or chips,  but they also have a card you can use to keep track of your orders.  After the 5th sandwich purchase you get 5$ off the next sandwich.  The staff is really nice and there is some seating area inside and plenty outside in the courtyard area.",

    "text": "The Sandwich Club is a great go to spot for lunch uptown.  Although the line can be deceiving it moves pretty quickly. They offer a variety of pre-made sandwiches and of course you can create own. As my previously review said I am huge Boar's Head fan, so still love that!   I typically create my own turkey sandwich and every time my sandwich is made correctly and they are huge! Overall a great spot for a grab and go lunch, and definitely deserves a star increase from 2013.",

I ordered it as a I was intrigued at the description \"drizzled with pepper honey\" (not the run of the mill mayo or mustard).  There was no wait and my sandwich was ready in no time.  The ingredients were fresh and the 8 grain bread was hearty and tasty.  The quality of the sandwich was worth the $7.  I would definitely get the same sandwich again.",

    "text": "This review will be a very mixed opinion - I've been here for lunch a number of times, and I always had good sandwiches and walked away very content with whatever I had ordered. That changed with my last visit when I continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte with a stop in at Sandwich Club. I had high expectations based on all my previous experiences - I left extremely disappointed.  The sandwich was bad from the first bite - it was cold in the center. Like right out of the fridge did they even toss it on the griddle cold. The corned beef lacked flavor, The cheese wasn't melted, the kraut was sweet instead of tart, and the one good thing was that the bread was at least average rye. The bread had seemingly been tossed in a toaster, which helped make sense for why the sandwiched was lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside. It was an all-around unpleasant experience, and the other person with me couldn't even make herself finish the sandwich.  If you go to Sandwich Club and order a majority of what's on the menu you'll leave quite happy. Just avoid the reuben - for whatever reason it's nothing like the rest of their sandwiches.",

    "text": "I came here with my co-workers today around 11:50am. The line was out the door, but there was a lady taking orders in advance so the line went pretty fast. The menu is huge and consists of maybe 30 different sandwiches (surprise). Most of them include meat, but because I'm currently being a 'vegetarian' I decided to build my own.  I got the oat hoagie bread with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, avacado, sprouts and spicy cilantro ranch. The hoagie was huge and the amount of cheese on my sandwich was unreal. I had to remove half of it. I literally had 10 pieces of cheese on it- it was insane! My other co-workers got the special of the day and another BYO. Everyone's toppings were loaded and they seemed to really enjoy their sandwiches.   They also had a HUGE variety of chips to pick from. The options were endless! My coworkers and I were going crazy looking at the different flavors (who knew they made a moscow flavored chip!). They also have a refrigerated section that includes pies, hummus, fruit and other desserts.  Our total for 4 sandwiches and chips came to $39. Not bad for lunch...  I will definitely be back!",

Unfortunately, we will no longer be eating from this place. I had an issue with a sandwich tray that had spouts on it after I asked them not to put spouts on the sandwich. When I went back to the store to make them aware of this and see if I can get another sandwich made the older lady begin to tell me I was lying! Yes, she told me in front of other customers that I did not know what I was talking about and that she made the sandwich as requested. After I took a deep breath, I politely said \"can you please just make another sandwich I will pay for it\". Money was not the issue I was using my company credit card. The issue was it was wrong. In the end I got no apology and ended up paying for another sandwich. After my colleagues found out about how I was treated we decided we will no longer be using them for any functions ever again! Worst customer service ever!",

The sandwiches are all hand crafted as you order them, the line moves quickly, the food proportions are perfect for lunch and the price is reasonable!  The staff is quick and efficient to keep the line moving during the lunch rush. I experienced the garden medley and the healthy choice, both were really great and kept me satisfied all day.",

The line was to the door, but the wait was not bad.  They take your order right away at the front, then you shuffle down the line with mounds of potato chips bags staring you in the face.  They beg to be eaten and you give in and snag a handful.  They have a bunch of different sandwiches, none of which sound boring.  Its a good spot.   Take the food and go eat outside.",
