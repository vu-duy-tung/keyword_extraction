    "text": "Hot damn, this was the best bagel sandwich I've ever had.   So I used to work at Bruegger's as a teen, and those are some good bagels: boiled up then baked for a crunchy outside and a nice chewy center. (I know it's a regional debate, but this is how bagels should be.)  I've eaten every kind of sandwich there is; my favorite is roast beef with jalapeno cream cheese loaded up with veggies, on a warm Everything bagel.   I digress. My point is, I now have a new favorite: I got the Hangover (Ham, Egg & Smoked Cheddar) on an Everything bagel. Wow. I wanted everything on the menu (check it out, it's huge) but I had to pick one.  So they steam the bagels after the sandwich is all put together. Or maybe before? Who knows. What I do know is that it makes the bagel slightly soft. Now, I wouldn't think I would be into that, but as it turns out I LOVE IT. A regular bagel, even when freshly baked, has a stiffness to it that when you bite into it, causes all the fillings to smoosh and shoot out the other side (which means you have to eat it like a taco and keep taking bites from different ends). This is not the case with a steamed bagel sandwich! The bagel is just soft enough to give so that everything stays in place resulting in a PERFECT PROPORTION OF BAGEL TO FILLING. Genius.  So I don't live in Charlotte, sh*t!! Wanna franchise in Austin!? For now, I'll have to make a point to stop by every single time I visit. (By marrying my boyfriend I've guaranteed this can occur at least once a year. Yup, that was in the PRO column when I decided to marry him. Granted he did ask me only a few hours after we ate at Owen's. In fact, he later told me, when we were in line, he asked the Magic 8 Ball on the counter if he should pop the question. The answer: \"Without a doubt.\" Thanks, Owen's Magic 8 Ball :-)  My point? Go there. Get your bagel on.   Oh, the staff is friendly, it's reasonably priced (if not cheap!!) and the  place is super  cute. Bring a Sharpie so you can leave your mark!",

    "text": "Most importantly the bagels are great. Shared the Mamas Lox and the Booty Bagel and enjoyed both. The only reason I am giving this place three instead of four stars is because the weekend morning crowd is clearly huge. Please push those tables in the waiting area to the side or remove them until post rush. It would not be difficult, and it would really help with maneuvering space as you are waiting. And mics would help to hear over the (great!) music. Again. Food is great. And that's really the most important part. But space during busy times would help the overall experience.",

Ive seen this place a thousand times but didn't actually know how big it is inside or how busy they get.   The menu has about 10,000 choices so it was really hard to make a decision. Went with one of the specials, which was a cubano bagel. My only complaint is that the pulled pork on my bagel was really dry. I would just get something else next time!",

    "text": "Yesterday before work I ran by Owens to get a bagel. They are one of the few bagel places I know of that carry vegan cream cheese so when I get a craving its nice to have them down the block from where I work.   Unfortunately yesterday there was a mix up and they put veggie cream cheese (real cream cheese with veggie bits mixed in) on my bagel instead. I didn't notice until I got to work and opened up my bagel. Luckily a co-worker brought some cereal and I traded her my bagel. But still, bummer, plain cereal was far from the toasted bagel I wanted.  So today I went back before work because I was still craving that bagel. It was the same man at the register from yesterday and I politely asked to make sure it was vegan and not veggie. He recognized me and apologized and took care of the cost for my bagel today. As I waited I watched him go over and tell the cook to make sure the correct spread was on my bagel. Everyone was very friendly and eager to correct the mistake from yesterday.   I wasn't expecting all they did. I work in the hospitality industry and I understand mix ups happen. I wasn't upset with them by any means and they still did everything they could to rectify the situation.",

Luckily, Owen's is pretty festive with plenty of things to look and read. I ordered the Grubby Bubby on an Everything Bagel and added jalapeno CC (per yelper's suggestion) while the boyfriend got the Mayberry Captain Midnight. I paid about $13 altogether. It took a little to come out since it was crowded, but I appreciate the fact that they call out the orders exactly how they are placed to avoid mix-ups. The Grubby Bubby came out huge compared to the MCM, the bialy bagel is pretty slim. The chicken salad on the MCM had good flavor but the chicken was overcooked and dry. The Grubby Bubby came out amazing as expected. The added jalapeno cream cheese is so worth it.   I will be back to try out more bagel sandwiches but I'll be placing my order via phone for easy pick up. Cheers!",

What is NOT gossip are how good their steamed bagel sandwiches are here.  Located in an unassuming end of a shopping center right off of South Blvd, you can easily miss this place if you are zooming down the road.  Once you find parking (usually in the back) you can go in, get your bearings.  They share space in the Pavilion in South End, so once you navigate to their side of the Pavillion, grab a menu (that's rather large and in charge) and calmly wait in line.  They have a bunch of stuff to look at while you are in line.  Their menu offerings - I call it artwork, but I am thinking the artwork is contributed by the tireless and hardworking staff at Owens.  The Hangover Helper has worked miracles for me, but really everything on their menu is amazing.  They have something for everyone too - breakfast person, non-meat eating person, bacon person, it's a smorgasbord of deliciousness when you come here.  Definitely a great GEM in the South End Community.... Owens is changing the world \"one bagel at a time\" like their motto suggests.",

They also have a BYO option so if you don't find anything you like you can always do that. Plus, if you check-in you get a free soda.   There is usually a line here, especially on the weekends, but they are pretty fast and the bagel is worth it.",

Today, not only did they get the order wrong but they used rotten eggs. The smell of my breakfast sandwich was so overwhelming that when I unwrapped it my friend asked what that smell was. Again, this on top of the fact that the order was completely wrong (see pictures). When I returned to get my money back, the manager just laughed, giggled and said have a nice day. And they didn't even fully refund my bagel! If you are desperately craving a bagel, save yourself the time, frustration and money and just go to Einstein's. At least their management will acknowledge when they've done something wrong.",

I'm usually in this area whenever I go to the dentist or get my hair done and failed to realize how close it was to both of those places for me!! Owen's is tucked away in the same strip as the Polished nail salon - right across the street from Atherton. All this time and I never paid attention!  I got to Owen's around 9:45 on a Saturday morning and was expecting to be met with a long line but thankfully it was not the case. I placed my order for a standard bacon & egg (no cheese please!) on an everything, a plain bagel (not toasted, only sliced), and coffee. For those three items, my total came to $9.36 which I found slightly ridiculous but whatevs. For the price, I didn't like the fact that there's only two coffee choices - decaf or regular. No flavored coffees to choose from but there's a slew of flavored creamers and half and half cups and sugars.  Once you place your order, you move over to the side to wait until your number is called out. Even though there was a good amount of people working behind the counter and not too busy, myself and others still had to wait a bit for our orders to be called. As I waited, I saw that they started to get busier and the line to place an order was getting longer. Once my number was called, I was very hungry and eager to jump right into my sandwich. I could feel the heat from the sandwich through the bag. And that sucker was HOT! like fresh out of the steamer hot. The bagel was nice and chewy but the everything bagel flavor was very underwhelming.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their signature sandwich creations just so I can really get a taste of an authentic Owen's bagel sandwich experience.",

    "text": "With great bagel sandwich names and wonderful combinations, Owen's Bagels is a solid locale to grab breakfast and/or lunch. The menu can be a bit overwhelming, so they have it narrowed down by the type of meat involved (which is helpful for folks who only eat certain meats). And if you go on the weekend, be prepared for a line and a bit of a wait due to the popularity of this trendy little joint.   I've tried the following:  1. The Muenster Mash on a whole wheat bagel - Hummus, Muenster, Green Peppers, Onion, Lettuce, and Tomato. Seriously good. My favorite bagel at Owen's. No need for meat when you have all this delicious veggieness on one homemade bagel. And at only $4.00, this is a steal.  2. Sir Purr's Purrfect Bagel on whole wheat - Turkey, Veggie Cream Cheese, Smoked Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato. I never thought I'd say this, but there was WAY too much cheese on this thing. Not sure if the maker of the sandwich was just heavy-handed with the veggie cream cheese or what, but I had to scrape a bunch of it off before I could even eat the sandwich. After that it was very good. A bit more expensive at $5.65.  3. Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Maple Nut Cream Cheese - I do not recommend this option. The bagel barely had any raisins in it and wasn't really very cinnamon-y, either. And the maple nut cream cheese was disgusting. Go for one of the sandwiches and you'll be much happier with your experience.  Be sure to bring your appetite as the bagel sammies are quite large. And take some time to read all the funny little quips written on the walls - or write some for yourself - either way you'll be entertained. Owens is located in South End across from the Atherton Mills Market. So swing in for a bagel sammie and then run across the street for some healthy fruits and veggies. A win-win all around!",

If you have some time and want a great bagel sandwich with a laid back atmosphere then you don't want to miss stopping by here. The walls are covered with graffiti (don't be afraid to add your own) and the music is an ecclectic mix. There is even a play area for smaller children with toys and books.  The sandwiches are made on real NY bagels and are steamed. I prefer mine toasted and they can do that too. I've had a few of their cleverly named sandwiches and you can even invent your own for them if you'd like. The breakfast sandwiches are great and filling. They even off free trade coffee along with a great mix of teas. During the winter months they offer a new soup each day which is delicious and satisfying. I love this place.",

The coffee was average, so I figure the bagel was going to be awesome! My first bite into the bagel was nice but a bite of everything together made me wanting more, a lot more. The sprouts were a bit on the old side and turkey didnt make me think Boars Head. I searched out some hot sauce (packets) and that helped a little. I wish they had a few bottles of Red Hot or something instead of the tiny packets.   I hope my third visit will be the charm!",

    "text": "Bagel lovers looking for a little something old and a little something new wrapped in an original one of a kind shop need to make Owen's a must-try.    The basic concept here is bagel sammies which have been steamed into submission.  Is it a little messy?  HELLZ YEAH.  But is it tasty?  Ridiculously so.  When the same-ole' won't cut it for my rise and shine, Owen's can awaken my taste buds.  For you purists, if you just want your round dough with just a schemer of something tasty, or if you like your bagel plain or just toasted, they can do that too.  You just have to ask at the time you order and you just have to know that your combo won't have a cool name posted on the hanging menus.  So kids, once and for all, YES they have a toaster and YES they will toast any sandwich or plain bagel.  Huzzah for customization!  Veggie friends, there are many options here.  Vegan friends, there's love for you too: who knew sprouts, avocado, tomato and hummus could get steamed and turned into such a tasty treat?!  Or how about banana, peanut butter, and local honey (assuming you're OK with honey)?  Gooey fun says me.  I also have to give major props to the locally roasted coffee served here.  Larry's Beans makes small batches and they make some pretty wicked flavors and blends.  The Ethiopian blend was nice but the Southern Pecan was so good it really did need any sweetener.  I walked out with a serious case of the jitters, but it was worth it.  Can't decide which to pick?  In my couple trips here the servers called out the \"Grubby Bubby\" at a ration of about 5:1.  Egg, Muenster, Smoked Cheddar, Avocado and Tomato on a Bialy.  Try picking that up at your local chain bagel shop.  Rock on Owen's crew.",

It's right across the hall inside the Pavilion.  Once you're inside, there are a variety of bagels, cream cheeses and sandwich options to choose from and, really, you can't go wrong, although I wish they cooked their eggs to order. If you can't decide, you can always get the \"lottery\" bagel. It's $6.50 for a bagel sandwich of the staff member's choice with chips and a fountain drink. I've never had a bad one yet!  A few insider tips... First off, get your bagel steamed instead of toasted. I know, it's crazy, but it's AMAZING. Second, at Owen's a bagel with everything on it isn't called an ET or an everything bagel, but a \"combo\" bagel.  One combo, steamed, with butter, please!",

    "text": "Years ago, my friend Jen raved about the steamed bagel sandwiches that she'd eaten while attending school in Ohio.  She couldn't contain her excitement about Bagel & Deli coming to Charlotte, and right down the road from her house no less!  I'll admit that I was somewhat dubious about the idea of something tasty coming from Ohio, and the idea of steaming a bagel just seemed strange and inappropriate, like eating chili on spaghetti noodles.  Steamed bread?  I cringed at the thought of the microwave sandwiches I ate in elementary school.  Boy, was I wrong.  Steamed bagels ARE good.  I like them, I like them, Sam I Am.    If you're heading to Owens for the first time, prepare yourself for being overwhelmed by the menu options.  You're going to go all deer-in-the-headlights and stuff.  Not only is the printed menu extensive, but there are construction paper signs hanging on a line displaying some of their more creatively titled menu items; hung there to distract you and cause you to inexplicably stare for minutes on end.   There is a seemingly endless list of fantastic sandwiches for you to choose from, or you can create and name your very own bagel sandwich creation.    I've only had one sub-par experience here but it was during a weird time of day when I'd imagine the third stringers were in the game.  I think that the vast majority of people are like me and enjoy eating at Owens after a long night out with friends, but this is a great place for breakfast or lunch any old day.",

The bagels, the cream cheese, the butter, even the coffee.  We were there in the morning and the bagels didn't taste very fresh.  Also not a huge fan of the way they sell their coffee- $2.50 for a giant cup + free refills.  I drink a small cup of coffee and would prefer to just pay for that.  It's also hard to ignore the strong smell coming from the nail place even when the nail place is closed.  Don't think I've met a bagel (from a bagel shop) that I didn't like, but today threw most of one away.",

I started out with 'safer' bagel options, the Sweet Caroline (blueberry bagel, cream cheese and cinnamon & sugar) delish and a good 1st timer bagel- but I still get it all the time!  I have since tried various sandwich bagels and have never been disappointed, they will let you add or remove items to your liking with no problem. When my husband found out that there was an Owen's in Charlotte he was excited, being a Miami of Ohio alum he ate there all the time in college- I can't say anything about the coffee, because I don't drink it- but I'm sure if you aren't happy with the temp, you can ask them for some fresh coffee and they would be happy to accommodate  We frequent Owen's a lot and love it every time!",

Located next to Leather & Lace and across from Icehouse and Atherton Market, this bagel joint is good for all ages. The \"named\" sandwiches are good for a good laugh and make the entire menu worth reading. Bagels are steamed and made to order on your bagel flavor of choice, though many are set for you for ease with the specific menu item.  When you make your way into the place, make sure you go to the counter away from the cashier and order at the counter by the people making the bagels. There's usually a line and just make sure not to skip. Once you've ordered, move over to the register and get a drink/coffee if you desire. Then you wait...about 3-4 minutes while they prepare your food. They'll call out the bagel, not your name, so be alert :)  My favorite is a unique order....Mr. Turkey, no lettuce, add egg on wheat. It's funny now, since I've been there a few times, the minute I say no lettuce, they finish with \"add egg on wheat\". Guess I come here often...ha. Great weekend morning place to chill with an inexpensive breakfast. They have a nice patio area too, so make sure you check that out too!",

One reason is the young kids they have working in there who talk and text on their phones and than proceed to make sandwiches without washing their hands. Cell phones are dirtier than toilets.  Another reason is the price.  Most bagels are over $5 and they are not worth the price - with combos costing about $7.  I can get a good sized fresh made sub from Jersey Mike's, with chips and a drink for that price.  Sure the interior is funky and it's local and all of that stuff, but when products are overpriced and service isn't so good, I'd rather go somewhere else and get my moeny's worth.",

It has amazing character, with its off beat decor and sharpie decorated tables.   But the real reason I visit Owen's is for the bagels. We transplanted New Yorkers are at a loss for real bagels - most of CLT is dominated by bagel chains that serve soft, doughy round rolls and call them bagels. Owen's has the real deal - dense, chewy, with real bite.   I have become addicted to a cream cheese I'd never have tasted prior to my CLT move. Bacon, ranch, scallion cream cheese - salty, tangy, tasty, perfect on a toasted sesame bagel. Owen's also offers sandwiches and fun, creative options for bagel based food. Try it.

It was probably about 7:30am? When I walked in, the lady behind the desk was on her phone, but she greeted me. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted, but she was patient and kept checking in on me to see if I was ready. I eventually made a build your own - I told you in the last review that I'm a little bit of a bagel and egg snob. I asked for a *toasted* not steamed bagel, with bacon, egg whites, cheese and avocado. She didn't say much until she gave me my bagel - then she told me that it was going to be a good sandwich and called me honey. A glimmer of friendliness! Yay! The sandwich was good, she was right. Unfortunately, with my bagel, bottle of water and coffee the total was over $10. But it was good food. Avocado seemed fresh, egg whites were good. I'll probably be back for a bagel, but I'll have to figure out what I like on the menu. Maybe eventually I'll get into the steamed thing? Yelpers, maybe we could all go and get some bagels. :)",

    "text": "Owen's Bagel & Deli has committed war crimes against my taste buds.  These are the worst bagels I've ever had that weren't purchased from a supermarket or a dirty food truck.  I took two bites and threw out my very expensive breakfast.  Ignore the other reviews for Owen's.  It's clear that these people have no idea what a bagel is supposed to taste like.  This place is a joke.  Let's get specific:  #1)  Flavor:  there isn't any.  These things have all the excitement of wonder bread.  #2)  Texture:  Mush.   Bagel's are supposed to be soft, dense and chewy on the inside with a crispy but yielding skin on the outside.   At Owen's you get a steamed pile of mushy goo.  Yes, STEAMED... more on that in a moment.  #3)  Toppings:  As any True New Yorker would do, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese a lox (that's smoked salmon for you North Carolina natives).  The fish they served me smelled really bad- not fresh at all... but what can you expect from an establishment that prides itself on Boar's Head meats?  Sidenote: Boar's Head is the Hunt's ketchup of deli meats- an inferior product that somehow maintains astonishing market share, despite offending anyone with taste buds.  Okay, so back to the part where they STEAMED my bagel:  I had asked for a TOASTED onion bagel, because that's the proper way to warm a bagel.  The moron behind the counter nodded dumbly and didn't mention that apparently Owen's doesn't OWN A TOASTER!   Instead, without informing me, she STEAMS my bagel, turning it instantly into soft, gooey mess, without even a hint of the crispy crust that the bagel may have started with.  If any heating method is the exact opposite of toasting a bagel, it's STEAMING a bagel.  It's like steaming a pizza or a hamburger... you just don't do it.   If I could give Owen's Bagel's a rating with negative stars, that's what I'd be doing right now.   After throwing out the worst bagel ever from Owen's, I drove a few minutes away to Bruegger's.   Sure, Bruegger's in a boring chain, but they at least know how to make a bagel that doesn't suck, and they understand how to work a toaster.  Also their smoked salmon was fresh.  I never thought I'd recommend them over an independently owned Bagel shop, but in this case, I have to.",

At a dining establishment? Not acceptable. I walked in and realized that the two women smoking were the employees. One should be at least inside waiting for customers and the smoking should be done away from the front entrance.   Anyway I went with one of their turkey sandwiches and asked to add tomato and veggie cream cheese and that my bagel be toasted. I realize this was a special order however, considering I was the only customer  it shouldn't have been that difficult to get right.  I also tried to be friendly and chat - and in response received not a smile, nothing. Not sure if it was just a bad day for them, but I couldn't help but feel as though they were irritated that I interrupted their smoke break.    I got all the way to work only to realize my bagel wasn't toasted...which as a New York native is a big no-no . It still tasted good, but I always toast my bagels even at home so I was really disappointed.   Considering they have gotten my order wrong more times than not, I may have to try poppy's in order to get my bagel fix. This makes me sad since Owen's has such a cool vibe and pretty darn good bagels.",

    "text": "OWen's is my go-to place for lunch. For less than $10 you can get a great sandwich, chips and a drink. They have a large selection of sandwich choices, so you are likely to get exactly what you want. I read the other reviews and would like to note that THEY HAVE A TOASTER YES! Their policy is to steam everything, so you have to be clear if you do not want that.   My fave is their wraps. A bagel all the time is a lot of calories and they have all the veggies i want for a delish wrap. I also recently tried their potato salad and LOVE IT! Compared to the other options in the neighborhood, this is the most affordable, locally owned, healthy option available. And they are always open to making me whatever I am in the mood for that day. Great staff! See you soon :)  My top menu choices: Their Lox sandwich is AWESOME (they add cucumbers yum) Dilworth (cream cheese and veggies) WRAPS!! (they will put anything they have)  They also carry tea CHEERWINE Diet Dr.Pepper and keep hot sauce behind the counter. All this place needs is more business!",

Somehow, the atmosphere on the particular afternoon I visited stressed me out.  A family with two screaming kids, spilling things on the floor.  The employees appeared to be squabbling over something or other and loudly calling out ingredients that they needed.  The layout is also a bit confusing with menus on one end, payment on the other that was opposite to guest traffic.  The staff on this day was a bit surly.  I did like the open, industrial vibe with writing on the walls and a variety of news magazine covers on the walls.  The lunch bagels have fun names and neat meat and veggie combinations.  I had a turkey, avocado, bacon and cheese bagel.  Steamed bagels are a strange concept for me.  I'm not a fan.  Bagels packed To Go will steam on their own in the wrapper, so why steam them to start?  All in all, I guess I like my bagels toasted and to eat them in a relaxing environment.  It's a matter of preference.",

Owens is my go-to spot for breakfast bagels for their creative menu, delicious sandwiches, and unique vibe.  Walking in for the first time can be a bit intimidating for a few reasons including the long line and expansive menu. I have no idea who put together their original menu, but it's worth a short read for entertainment. If you can't find something that grabs you, then you can't go wrong with making your own. I often lean on bacon, egg, cheddar with avacado. Hangover helper is a solid backup (and yes, it does help).   I do like that they steam their bagels, which seems to meld the flavors together better than toasting. Be careful though, as the bagels are around 1 million degrees when you first get them. Also be sure to check out their strong coffee game that features local roasters and now cold brew on tap.",

It really is a great sandwich. The bagel is fresh and chewy. If you are from NYC and know anything about H&H bagels, they kind of remind me of those.   As we sat there, I was intrigued by the writing on the wall. I just sat and read as many as possible. I'd love to come back and try some of their other sandwiches, or even just get one of those bagels with cream cheese.  The iced coffee is self-serve, WITH A WARNING! They have a camera fixed on you so you don't try to get free refills. The coffee was very good, I just wish the creamers were in a canister as opposed to the small individual creamers. I know...not a dealbreaker, just a personal preference.",

I hate leaving negative reviews, but people need to know what they're getting into. Do not go here expecting a normal bagel. Most places (including the best delis in the world) boil and then bake them.  A few places like Owens are experimenting with steaming them instead. Problem is, they come out soggy! Especially if you get one to go, that's sat in foil paper. This is why these places aren't catching on. My order was a simple bagel with egg, and it was a soggy mess. It fell apart while I was eating it, like I was eating lumpy oatmeal with my hands.  I think people's opinions of this place are skewed because it's a hip bohemian-ish atmosphere with writing on concrete walls, old furniture, etc. It's a very Charlotte thing to do. We love our gentrified pretend hole in the wall. But I'm sorry, this place wouldn't last a week somewhere like NYC.  If you want a great bagel, do yourself a favor, and go somewhere like Poppy's. Get a real bagel, prepared properly just as they have been for centuries.",

Service was great, received food in a timely manner, and it was a lively atmosphere.  Only complaints are the fact that there's limited parking since it shares a small lot with other businesses in the building and the strip club next door, and then also that it's located in a building with free-standing and partition walls that don't reach the ceiling so the bagel shop smells strongly of the nail salon next door. Because of this, I fee like it's better for a grab and go kind of thing.",

    "text": "You will wait (if you don't call ahead), but it will be worth it. With that being said.. call your order in before you go. They usually have a separate line where you can pickup call ahead orders too. If they don't pick up the first time you try calling, call again.  While there are plenty of options, I tend to go the traditional bacon, egg and cheese route. With pimento cheese, of course.  Check in on Yelp for a free fountain beverage! They do also have a frequent buyer card that you after you buy 10, you get one free.   Seating is fairly limited, and with how many people are usually waiting, I prefer to just order to go. However, there are about 10-15 tables if you can snag one and don't mind people standing around you while you eat. You will be too enthralled by your sandwich to really even notice.  Was a little confusing the first time figuring out how to get inside. They are located in a multi-tenant building, so you will need to walk into the establishment's main doors, and will then see the entrance to Owen's on your right.",

Ambling over on Saturday and/or Sunday mornings to read the paper and munch on a Hangover Helper was the best part of my week. The fact that they included a fountain soda along with an egg, cheddar and sausage (that's what I got on it, anyway) onion bagel sandwich immediately impressed me regarding how well they knew what cured my hangovers. Oh, and the Chia Bagel, Hot Tuna Meltdown, and Banana Surprise are other favorite menu items.   I'm no longer a resident, but Owen's is always one of my first stops back in town. Last week we were in Charlotte for four days - four days made great by three lunches at Owen's!",

If the service was bad, I was already PO'd so I'd probably take it out on them. However, if the service was good, the contrast would make them look like they served manna from heaven. Well, here is how it went... great! First off, the place is sorta weird and unconventional... a big plus for me. The menu was varied and options a plenty.  In addiation, they use Boar's head products, so I know they care. Placed the order after a short wait, and recieved it in about five minutes. Everything was yummy and we were happy campers. Rita's BLT gets a thumbs up and my sesame seed, egg and Colby bagel was a belly pleaser also.  Added bonus, people graffiti the walls with Sharpie pens. I exacted my revenge toward the retro dump . . . killed two birds with one stone ( and two bagels).",

They've improved their ordering system over the years which makes it a whole lot easier to hear when your order is called (# rather than type of sandwich). The service is a little rough around the edges and seating is a bit sparse with the weekend hordes of 20-somethings coming in looking like they just finished yoga and/or a marathon.

My favorite is the grubby bubby. These sandwiches are so good and gone in two seconds.. I finish one and it takes all my willpower not to get back in line.

Owen's is hands down the best specialty bagel sandwich shop in Charlotte.  Listen, that's a big statement from me.  My family has been in the bagel business for over 50 years.  We owned one of the first bagel shops in New York and LA before Brueggar's and Einstein's came in and demolished everyone.  You want a good bagel in Charlotte?  Owen's or Poppy's.  That's it.  All you need to know is if you can dream it, Owen's can do it.  Fan Favorites: * Grubby Bubby * Booty Bagel on Blueberry  Personal Favorite: * Bagel, Egg and Chive Cream Cheese (add salt and pepper) on Everything.  Other Important Notes: Dogs are welcome, but not preferred inside the actual bagel shop.  You can write on the walls.  If you're going with two people, best to each get your own sandwhich and then share a Booty Bagel for dessert (Yes, I most certainly believe in breakfast dessert).  My only wish is that they had better coffee.  But for how good the bagels are, I'll drink it.  Cheers to the fat kids!",

    "text": "I really wish that I could make this my go to bagel shop...but as the saying goes, 3 strikes and you're out. Prior to todays visit I would give Owens a solid 3 stars. They're Bagels are nothing to rave about...but they do have a pretty funky/unique space and they do offer tons of sandwich options. Personally, I don't really care for all these crazy sandwich combinations. I just want a GOOD bagel with some cream cheese...maybe an egg sandwich. I'm pretty sure if you take two pieces of card board, load it up with the grubby bubby or booty bagel options, or add avocado, tomato. etc - it's going to be tasty. If that's what people are into, that's cool. I'm more about the actual bagel, ya know?   I've been eating Bagels all my life up in NY and I can honestly say that I was spoiled with the amount of great options that I had up there. And yes I get it, this is Charlotte -- Not NY. Now I'm not a professional, but I'm pretty sure this place skips out on one crucial step of the bagel making process - the poaching step. I do understand that boiling equipment is super expensive and also takes up lots of space. I'm pretty sure that they just brush their bagels with some water and a little baking soda (similar to what you would do with a soft pretzel) and then hit them with steam once they're in the oven. It's easy to identify an imposter by looking at the bottom of the bagel since steam wont get to the bottom of the bagel once its on a pan or in the oven.    LESSON OF THE DAY: If the bottom is much harder and darker than the rest of the bagel, you're eating a roll with a hole, not a bagel my friend! The bagels here almost remind me of one of those Thomas' bagels from the super market. But anyways, enough about the bagels.  Today's experience brought them down to a 2 star rating - I ordered a bacon egg & cheese (with salt, pepper, ketchup) to go and I got a small coffee - My bill was  $8.39. The word \"pricey\" doesn't usually come out of my mouth....but I walked out of the store thinking to myself...\"dear god, did I just pay almost $9 for a bagel & small coffee?\"  I get to my office, sit down and go to enjoy my sandwich, which for that price should have been wrapped in gold foil. Slowly, disappointment began sinking in  (insert worlds saddest song on worlds smallest violin here**)  1) My sandwich was pretty small - hey, it is what it is. I wouldn't complain about it being small if it at least tasted delicious and the order didn't get screwed up. 2) The eggs reminded me of dunkin donut egg sandwiches - you know, those premade egg patties that get nuked in the microwave. 3) Lastly, they left out the salt, pepper & ketchup!!! The SPP is crucial on my egg sandwiches!   BEC with salt, pepper, ketchup...doesn't seem like a difficult order. Anyways,I'm happy that most people on here have had a great experiences here... I wish I could feel the same way.   Long story LONGGGGG, It's safe to say that I won't be coming back to Owens. As I mentioned earlier, I really wish I could make my go to spot since they are around the corner from where I live...but it does look like I'll have to take a 10min drive elsewhere when I'm in the mood for bagels -- (wont name drop other businesses as I don't like to do that).",

I usually get jalapeno cream cheese or the chive cream cheese on the Mama C's Lox bagel and it really adds some delicious extra flavor to it. I add bacon to the Mary's Bubby Grubby bagel. Both are absolutely amazing and do not disappoint! Their menu is extensive for both breakfast bagels and lunch bagel sandwiches, so there truly is something for everyone. I would love to try more in the future, but I always have a hard time straying from my favorites! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality bagel with lots of bagel sandwich options. You can also get a rewards card if you go here a lot and earn a free bagel every 10 trips!",

Sure, they have \"plain\" but who wants a plain bagel when you can have onion or garlic or everything?  It was a late start on Sunday for us, landing at Owen's at 1:30 in the afternoon. A little sad to see that they had already run out of coffee, but we were satisfied to find a Dr. Brown's cream soda in the fridge.  Excellent salmon on a bagel with capers for Mrs. K. A lovely bagel with egg and cheese and ham for me. Delish. Just sad about the coffee.",

One Sunday morning my fiance and I decided to branch out and try Owens since they've been rated the best bagels in Charlotte - I went in with an open mind and an optimistic attitude. When I got to Owens the line was out the door which I hoped was an indication of how good the food was. We waited in line for at least 15 minutes before getting to the counter. About 1/2 way through the line we got a menu which was way too long! Every bagel and sandwich possible was listed out. Which in some cases would be nice - but in this situation it was too much. The atmosphere was bright, loud, and crowded. Fast forward - I place my order, the woman working at the counter was friendly. Now I move to the left of the restaurant where you wait for your food and I'm standing there with at least 20+ other people all waiting for our food. I'm not sure if this is usual, but we waited for 20 minutes to get our bagels. At this point I'm exhausted and hungry and tired of being crammed in a small area with everyone. Finally after being here for over 30 minutes we get our bagels. My fiance and I take our bagels outside - and they're very average. Not disgusting. They're edible, but not noteworthy. They're not worth the hype or the wait.",

    "text": "This review is based solely off my reuben experience - this rating could vary significantly with something more common from Owen's.  A bagel place offering a reuben is certainly an interesting option, and I was excited to continue my reuben adventure with this unique take on the classic sandwich. I wish I had tried something more common (although that wouldn't have worked well to continue my journey around Charlotte to try all of the reubens the city has to offer).  The reubagel, as I decided to call it, just didn't have a setup for success. A bagel is significantly thicker than any rye bread you're going to find, so I think it has to be overstuffed (NYC style) to really get the proper proportions. Sadly, this one was not. Each bite tasted like bagel with a little bit of meat and cheese mixed in. The middle ingredients were fairly common, with average corned beef, very little kraut, good swiss but lacking in quantity, and a russain dressing that was a little sweeter than what works for a reuben. The pumpernickel rye bagel was tasty, but that was too be expected from a bagel place. I don't recommend trying the reubagel as there are far better options on the menu.",

Everyone was so friendly! I guess I had a confused look on my face so they asked if it was my first visit, I said yes and they were very excited and made a few suggestions. I took them up on the special of the day.   On Wednesday's it's \"A nice piece of Ash\" - love the name...probably because I had fun saying it.   But I loved the sandwich even more. It has all of my favorites (turkey, cream cheese, veggies and bacon) on an everything bagel.   My sandwich was ready in no time! And I'll admit that this was my first experience with a steamed bagel. I didn't really know what to expect. Would it be soggy? Would I be able to taste all the flavors I love in my everything bagel?   Thankfully, it wasn't a soggy mess and I loved how all the flavors blended together! Nice job Owen's...THIS is how you spice up an ordinary turkey bagel sandwich.   So far it's my favorite. Ok, I know...I haven't tried anything else. I'm a bit bias. But I know if I went again I'd order this without hesitation! So that's always a good thing. I definitely want to try out their breakfast too.   See you guys very soon!",

After explaining he never received his food, the manager handed him a punch card with only one punch in it. He would have to buy 8 more to even get one free.

The place has a young, \"college-y\" feel with things hanging and written all over the walls and tasteful rap music thumping - almost like a club. It also reminded me of my CookOut days while back at uni. Once you've put your order in at the fro t counter you kind of stand/sit around until your number is called.  **caveat: this place may be fast-casual in food order/delivery and have a young/college ethos BUT it is extremely tasty and there were a few families with their babies present. Just saying.  The menu is extensive with plenty of bagel types to choose from with several main/meat ingredients: tuna and Chx salad; turkey; pizza; corned and roast beef; bacon; egg; veggie; etc. Add ons like assorted cheeses and cream cheeses; guacamole; basil; peppers; tomato; pizza sauce; etc.   They offered for a if their own renditions with all kinds of different combinations or you could build your own w $1.75 bagel and $0.50-$1.00/ topping. On top of being beyond reasonably priced it was super tasty!  I was one human being in a party of four and the Owen's Bagels team happens to let one order slip through the cracks.. after she waited ~25 minutes I approached the counter w the issue. At the end of the day they more than took care of us and made it right.  TL;DR. If you are in Charlotte and don't at least brunch here once, you're doing yourself a huge disservice. This spot is AWESOME! Indoor seating only.  Until next time..  CHEERS!!!",

They have a large selection and you can pretty much build any kind of bagel sandwich you want. The location is in a building where different businesses rent out spaces, but it's across the way from a nail salon so you get whiffs of the chemicals while you're eating. Yum. If you go during prime hours, be prepared for a line out the door and a wait. I don't go out of my way to go here, but I do like it when I'm in the Southend area.",

Parking was not a hassle which as always is a plus for me. I loved the decor. There was graffiti all over the walls which sort of reminded me of back home in NYC. There were plenty of tables as well. Then again I did go pretty early. The staff was extremely courteous as it was my first time there. I opted for the Sweet Caroline bagel. Basically a blueberry bagel with cinnamon sugar and cream cheese. It was SO GOOD! I wished it was bigger tho. I've never seen coffee on tap but the cold brew was on tap. I tried to get a video of me working the machine but i deleted it by mistake. I'm not the smartest sometimes. Anyway the coffee was self serve so I poured as much creamer and sugar in as I could lol. The price for both was decent. About $7 for both the bagel and the coffee. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other variations just based off of this experience. Good Stuff!",

They are very sloppy here, and also don't always listen to what you are asking for; like, \"don't put it on the grill/boiler\". The eggs aren't very good either.  Basically, if you are a vegetarian or have food allergies - or just like to get what you actually order- don't go here. If you'll eat anything, you'll probably like it.",

I declined his offer, and he gave me a new bagel very quickly.  Well I wished I had took him up on that offer because when I got my \"new\" toasted bagel it was very clear that they had just replaced the cream cheese.

But what they do with those bagels makes this place noteworthy. It is not a unique concept but they seem to be the only place in Charlotte that has really taken bagel sandwiches to the next level. Offering about 50 bagel sandwich varieties plus the ability to make custom sandwiches or just have a bagel with cream cheese, there is definitely something for everyone here. You can get everything from a sausage egg and cheese bagel to a post workout peanut butter and banana sandwich to one piled high with turkey, avocado, sprouts, and cheese. They even have one to help with your hangover. ;-) While prices start at just over $2, plan on spending $4-6 for a bagel sandwich and even more if you want chips and fountain drink or coffee. But, you will always leave content and looking forward to your next visit, ready to try a different delicious combination.",

    "text": "Just like Pat's steaks... but with bagels... and in Charlotte...  I want to start this out with my favorite part of Owens- their service. I got up here just as they were opening their doors on a Saturday to see a line formed outside. Of course at first I didn't have a good feeling about waiting. Usually when you see a line out the door of any place in the south you better clear your schedule for the rest of the day. But I was told this was pretty normal operation here for a Saturday morning, so I figured I'd stick it out. Thankfully the line moved quick. Once inside and ready to give my order, I was hit with that classic \"quick jab\" ordering convo that had been keeping the line moving. Love it. So similarly to an order at Pat's, I also limited myself to just three responses- \"Mama C. Everything bagel. Regular cc.\" Paid, and stepped aside. Painless. So painless. And the order was out just as quick as waiting in the line. That, my friends, is how it's done.  As for a VERY close second- their food. These bagels are FRESH and the sandwich combo's are fantastic. You cannot leave here without finding one of their menu items to become your new breakfast addiction. My Mama C- which was lox sandwich on an everything bagel with all the trimmings- was about one of about a dozen others I was on the fence with. (Just means I'll have to be back another eleven times I guess!) And don't think they are only limited to breakfast-type sandwiches either, they definitely have all kinds.   The atmosphere of this place deceives you into thinking you've strolled into the Noda neighborhood temporarily.   There can definitely be some limited seating on a Saturday.",

Besides their delicious bagels, they sell this AMAZING brand of cold brew coffee, called Pure Intensions.

Owen's sits inside the Pavillion which is across South Blvd from Atherton Mill.  It's a funly place with eclectic decor from sports pennants to chalkboard signs.  Their menu is quite extensive of breakfast and deli sandwiches and they feature Boar's Head deli meats.  I ordered the Hangover Helper bagel sandwich which consisted of ham, egg and smoked gouda cheese.  Just the smell of the smoked gouda told me I was about to have a Foodgasm.  The bagel itself was soft, the ham was stuffed on it and the gouda...mmmmmmmmmm.  One of my favorite cheeses.    The staff is very friendly here.  There's plenty of tables in the space and fountain drinks are help yourself.    You definite get your money's worth here.",

Having just moved from Boca Raton, FL, where aside from New York is the land of the Jewish Deli, I've been yearning to find the equivalent here in Charlotte. Not realizing that outside of my Jewish Deli bubble it was going to be very hard to satisfy my craving, I finally stumbled upon Owens and I am blissfully satisfied.     I wish i would have asked her name but a very sweet woman told me all about the place after I told her that it was my first time there and so I ordered my onion bagel with lox(nova)cream cheese onion and tomato. I was verrrry happy to finally find a place that resembled something like home.     It's a very unique looking little place. Hand drawn menus hanging up, that are very funny and writings all over the wall which is pretty darn cool. They have some organic options as well as supporting local vendors which is AWESOME! So if you haven't tried it yet, Just do it!! I will be coming back when I have my bagel and lox cravings (which happens often).",

I have lived in this city for 9 months now and cannot believe it took that long to discover this gem. Owens is tucked away inside the pavilion in south end with somewhat limited parking options.   The inside is very casually. Writing, scribbles, graffiti, hieroglyphics, and artwork adorns the walls along with stickers, college pendants, and signs with what I imagine to be regular customer's special orders.  The bagels are all fresh daily and the steam the sandwiches. I highly recommend the bialy. They are small but unique, flavorful and delicious.  The menu is humongous...overwhelming really. In addition to that, their are individually created variations mounted above the deli counter. It's usually busy and I always find myself rushing to figure out what I want. My first visit I was hurried into ordering and settled on the Mary's grubby bubbly. It was on the small size because of the bagel, but superb.  On the second visit I had a custom creation of sprouts, bacon, mayo, provolone, lettuce, and avocado on an everything bagel and was equally impressed.  I am so incredibly excited to have found this place and am sure I will be back very soon!",

I'm not sure if they've had a management change in the last couple of months, but as my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte, things have really taken a complete 180. I used to know pretty much the whole staff here, was greeted warmly by first name the 3+ times a week I'd come in and pick up to-go orders for my whole staff at work.   Recently, the staff has seemed uninterested in dealing with customers, which I can look past, but what I cannot look past is errors on my last four orders. They haven't gotten a single order right in the past two weeks, something slightly wrong every time (and to which I can't correct because It's during the work day and I don't have time on my lunch break to make two trips back and forth for error orders) until today in which I only ordered two sandwiches (normally 10+ but staff has grown tired of not getting what they paid for).  The gist of the order was easy, one Mateo ranchero (I'm vegetarian) and one sausage egg and cheese. When I got into Owens I told them the name for my to go order and the staff member cashed me out and informed me they threw in some extras. Very grateful for the kind gesture, I tipped well and went on my way. Get to work, and I have two sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and two everything bagels. My mateo ranchero is MIA. I called and they of course offered to make a new one but my work is off selwyn and not exactly the closest drive on an hour break, so I informed them I wouldn't have time to come back by for the correct order to which I was told \"well I don't really know what to tell you?\". I don't want you to tell me anything, I don't want you to tell me you gave me extras, I just want to receive what I paid for and it be correct.  I've filled out literally 20+ \"buy ten sandwiches get one free\" punch cards over the last three years I've lived in Charlotte and just want things to return to old form at Owens.    The last thing I'd suggest, which takes one extra second on to go orders is to label the different sandwiches. When you're getting 10+ sandwiches, no one wants to play the guessing game on whose sandwich is whose, and open all the foils to find out. I would have told you to go to Owens all day every day six months ago, but I wouldn't recommend anyone go to Owens in its current state.",

Lets back up and start with i didn't get any bagels, i didn't experience any of the stellar service ppl rave about. I got 2 hours of wasted time. I was lying in bed scrolling thru social media when I seen Owen's post that they are open and also accepting call in orders. I got really excited because so many places were closed for business. Nowhere did they state there were special hours or an early closure due to inclement weather.   Anyway i try to head out the first time and got stuck in the snow slush mix so i turned back around. Vowing to return after more snow melted. Minutes after 2 i trekked back out and guess what??? I made it!! I nearly died but i made it. Only to see No one there and ALL DOORS locked. Well im sure, because u all know me personally, u know I was furious. To get out my bed TWICE to get gourmet bagels for my annoying family and come back with random breakfast from whatever i could find which ended up being Wendy's.   So here's my issue, no updates to customers, no voicemail, no letter even on the door except pertaining to Christmas. There were some folks yesterday willing to risk their life for a booty bagel in the nasty weather & yal didnt even have the curtesy to update any of the platforms in which someone could reach you. Presently I'm unsure if I'll try again, I'm disappointed in my first experience.  Is this dramatic... Yes. Do i wish i had a bagel to shut me up.... Well, yes. But when life throws you lemons  you drive back home in the snow. *shrugs*",

As bagels are my one food I could eat every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of them, I have high standards. And Owen's has literally never disappointed (except for that time when someone decided to run their car into the building and they were closed for a devastating amount of time. But that's not the bagels' fault).   ANYWAY I placed my low carb diet on hold yesterday for lunch (to kick off Thanksgiving week, duh) and again- did not disappoint.   I have been getting Kool Jules as my go-to deli sandwich. For a time, it was off the menu but they would make it for me anyway, and eventually it ended up back on the menu. I like mine with cucumbers instead of sprouts- definitely a good decision. A couple other good ones I've had are the Tonya Harding Club and the BobEQue. My fav breakfast ones are the Sweet Caroline, the Banana Surprise and the traditional Breakfast bagel with sausage egg cheese and cream cheese.   GO TO OWENS! THEY ARE CHANGING THE WORLD ONE BAGEL AT A TIME!!!",

You'll walk into Owens and think you're in a grungey cafeteria but you'll taste the food and you won't care where it's coming from. They've got all kinds of flavor combinations and they're all good. My favorite is the \"Guaca Flocka Flame\" which has guacamole, siracha, Turkey, some cheese and other stuff. It's great. The inside of Owens is nothing fancy so feel free to show up in your makeup from the night before. Music is always loud and typically Drake, front counter is super friendly but the people who call out the numbers are usually grumpy. Their loaded grits are always a yummy extra.",

It was something about the sausage patty. It was flavorless and mushy. Really unappetizing.   We also attempted to share a plain bagel with the Reese's Peanut Butter cream cheese but could  only get a couple bites down. The bagel was what you'd expect, but the cream cheese was a total let down! I think it was just plain cream cheese with a couple peanut butter cups melted/steamed in there. So, the flavors were kind of sour from the plain cream cheese, sweet from the chocolate, rich from the peanut butter. Not great.   I'm glad we tried them out. (I love trying new places!) But, unfortunately, we won't be back to Owens. I just can't bring myself to schlep to South End for a hit or miss breakfast when the incomparable Poppy's is just around the corner from our house.",

His was much better than mine  but I have to say, the bagels were just soooo good. I have definitely been missing out. Will be trying the egg sandwich and other options in the near future.

It is so delicious. There are lots of options so there's something for everyone and even if you're not into all the creative flavors you can still get a plain bagel with cream cheese. The trick is that they steam their bagels which make them just soft enough. On this particular day we decided to get three bagels, the Phish, Bob-B-Cue and the Lottery. The lottery is where you let the geniuses at Owen's make you up a bagel. I'm not even sure what was all on it but it was amazing. The Phish which is my favorite had bacon, onions, bacon ranch cream cheese, pepper jack cheese, tomato and avocado on a asiago bagel. The BBQ bagel looked good as well but I wasn't looking to see what was on it because the phish and lottery were taking all my attention. My friend said that his BBQ bagel was amazing. In conclusion, venture here and try these amazing concoctions. You won't be disappointed. Oh and try to get there early seeing as how they fill up pretty quickly and it's hard to find seating. Other option is just call ahead and then pick up. Take your bagel sandwich home and devour it because I know you are.",

Annoying, however, to pay nearly $7 for a sandwich and a plain bagel only to see the guy walk out the back carrying three bags of store-bought bagels and dumping them into the bin. At least try to trick us into thinking they're fresh by bringing the bin to the back and dumping the bagels there. Again, the sandwich is good (I got the Wilford). But the bagels aren't fresh and they're just plain generic store bought so save yourself the money and just buy a bag of bagels for the half the price.",

They toast, they steam, and they have a menu that can't be beat.  I tend to drop in once a week at breakfast.  Not a great coffee selection but it's also not a coffeehouse so I can't base the review on that.    I tend to grab an Everything w Cream Cheese, a Breakfast Bagel, the Hangover Helper, or Mary's Grubby Bubby (pictured : Egg, Muenster, Smoked Cheddar, Avacado, Tomato on a Bialy).  Grubby Bubby is so so good and fresh.  All fantastic.  Best in Charlotte.",

It hits the spot every time, 100% sober of hungover.

I love a place that knows to give you a generous serving of cream cheese! Their bagels are between $1-8 depending on what you get and how you like it! If you can't decide, order the Lottery Bagel and they'll surprise you with something off the menu.   This is a hot spot for breakfast on the weekends and for morning commuters on the weekdays, so be strategic about when you stop by to avoid a huge wait.  If you want something funky and different, go for the Ya Boi: plain Cream Cheese, bacon, turkey, Cheddar, American, topped with crushed Nacho Doritos on a Asiago bagel.  If you want something sweet, go for the Sweet Caroline: plain Cream Cheese and cinnamon & sugar on a blueberry bagel.  If you're a bacon lover, go for the Pimento BLT: housemade pimento, bacon, lettuce, and pick your bagel.  In the mood for breakfast, go for the Breakfast in Bed, with sausage, egg, and waffle, or the Booty Bagel, with peanut butter, banana, and honey on a cinnamon raisin bagel.  They also have a kids menu, so they cater to everyone!",

First off- you can get your bagel steamed instead of toasted. I hate when I get a bagel that is over toasted and love that I know that won't happen here. The bagels are a perfect amount of chewy and they have a ton of flavors to choose from.  Prices are great. You can get a bagel and cream cheese for $2.50. If you are feeling lucky you can also order a lottery bagel (where they choose for you) for $8.50 and it comes with chips and a drink.   Finding this place can be tricky. It is right across from Atherton Mill next to Polished. There is a small amount of parking out front and more around back. There are plenty of tables inside the restaurant and there are also more out back- I just realized this my last visit and wish I had known before because it was a great day for outdoor eating!   The only downside to this place is the line. On the weekends it is LONG, sometimes curling out of the restaurant. Don't let this discourage you, it moves quickly and is definitely worth it.",

They have normal cream cheese spread but they also have a bacon ranch one that is literally crack! It's so good. I could eat the whole entire container if I wanted to.   I ordered the hangover special with bacon instead of ham and baby!!  It's amazing. It didn't even need the cream cheese i added because it was so flavorful without it. My boyfriend ordered the Phish bagel that comes with egg, bacon, bacon ranch cc, tomato, onion, and avocado. His bagel was also crack!

If it is at the office for a meeting, I might grab one, I might not. However, I love deli sandwiches. The marriage between great bagels and great deli sandwiches at Owen's is one of beauty. The meat is fresh, the bagels are right and the love is apparent. The variety of sandwiches and bagels is good. My favorite is called the \"Ya boi.\" It has an Asiago bagel, cream cheese, turkey, bacon, and nacho cheese Doritos. If you have never put chips on your sandwich, do so... now. It's amazing. However, you can be more basic, if you want. You can just have a bagel or some vegetarian option if that makes you happy. It's all good. Also, their cheesy hash browns are also scrumptious. Check em out, they will not disappoint.",

I was handed a white cup, not sure if it was for the  water or coffee. I approached the gentleman making the bagels if I could get the coffee. He said the cups were next to the coffee. Went to fill up the coffee and both containers were empty. Had to wait 15 minutes to get the coffee. The original person that got my order came to me and said you didn't pay for coffee. I told him that's the drink I want it. With a smirk in his face, he reply for future reference you should pay for it. That's what I thought I did, the white cup has water. I asked to let me pay for difference. They should be specific in their weekly specials it should say Fountain drink and chips, instead of drink and chips.   Honestly, I won't come back.",

They have everything that reminds me of the bagel joints I grew up with in the mid-Atlantic and north east states, including the attitude. :)  I knew upon reading the menu and seeing three basic facts, I was going to love my meal: 1. Getting your bagel \"scooped\" 2. It's \"lox\", not smoked salmon 3. They have everything bagels  There are few places in Charlotte that really make me feel like I'm at home in Maryland again, but this is one of them. I can't wait to bring my dad here for a lunch bagel and a Dr Brown's black cherry soda. :)  And they have a bagel punch card. We're already up to 4! Can't wait for my free one!",

The past 4 times my husband and I have ordered from here (we call in the order), the food given to us has been wrong. This past weekend we had friends over and had ordered 4 bagel sandwiches. We only received 3 of the 4, and the 3 we did receive weren't right.   I called to make them aware and they were too busy to deal with the issue at the time. So I called back today and they offered me nothing. I ordered 4 things and only received 3 and none of those 3 were even correct and you aren't willing to refund me? Further, I explained that I'm a loyal customer who loves their food and I am making them aware of this issue because I have to imagine others are having similar problems. The manager apologized but offered no solution .... didn't even say she was going to make her staff aware of the problem.   This is very unfortunate because I think they have the best breakfast bagel sandwiches in CLT and are right by my house!",

I visited today between classes, and the menu made everything sound so great I couldn't decide and ordered two different bagels: the booty bagel and an onion bagel with house-made veggie cream cheese. The shop is an open warehouse type set up; customers are allowed to leave their mark/artwork/name on any wall with space and there is plenty of seating and workspace available.  [The Booty Bagel] Cinnamon raisin bagel with peanut butter, banana and honey; perfection from start to finish. How could this taste bad? [Onion with Veggie CC] The bagel could have had more onion sprinkled on top, but I say that as a die-hard onion fan. The cream cheese was great! Reminded me of the garden veggie CC at most other bagel shops.   *I also got a free fountain drink coupon just for checking in on Yelp! so thats always a good deal.",

    "text": "Oh how I love a good bagel. But what's better than a regular bagel, a bagel sandwich! And some might not like bagels because in general they are hard and just really bready. Fear not, this place is the place to change your whole mindset!   I heard this place was good and thought I would give it a chance on Saturday morning. Walked into this funky, hipster like place which I never even noticed was beside a nail salon(polished) I've been to a couple times. The line was not  long and was moving quickly. I looked at their menu online and already knew what I wanted. They have their menu posted up in a funky, kinda hard to read, way; so I recommend going to the front of the line and Getting a paper menu while you wait. The menu is glorious and gigantic , giving you breakfast and lunch sandwich favorites, but on bagels! While in line I saw a sign for loaded hash brown patties. Two patties, bacon, cheese, green onions and spicy ranch. How could I not resist ordering  that ! I ordered the hangover helper ( onion bagel, egg, Ham and cheese) which come with a fountain drink, but I got iced coffee instead.(YELP PERK-Check in for free fountain drink!!!). And of course I ordered the loaded hash browns. I must admit I was displeased with the size cup for the iced coffee. Smaller than expected especially since it's $1 for a refill. Now to get the ice coffee is cool. And comes on taps and you get it yourself. But don't think you can sneak back to get your refill for free, there is literally a camera pointed on you to make sure you pay!   I got my coffee and went to wait about 10 min for my food to go. I tried sipping my drink slow but I was constantly sipping it, including on the way home, including the entire time I ate. And here I am still with coffee; I take back the size of the cup being too small. Obviously I'm used to larger cups filled with lots of ice and not just straight cold brewed coffee without the ice. So don't let the short looking cup fool you, It was perfect.   The bagel was delicious. They are known to steam their bagels and I constantly forgot it was even a bagel. It was so soft and moist and perfect.  The hash browns were the real game winner!!!!! They were sooooo good. So happy I did not skip them. I think it was the ranch that really made them stand out. And don't worry, it really didn't taste like ranch, just more like some special sauce. Anyways, get it! You won't regret it. Can't wait to come back for lunch and explore the menu more!",

    "text": "I've never had a steamed bagel before, but after hearing so many good things about Owen's Bagel, my husband and I (finally!) had to give them a try.  They are a bit tricky to find, located in The Pavilion, a small strip shopping center across from Atherton Mill.    Once we found parking, we headed inside.  Owen's is located inside The Pavilion, and they have a fun and quirky vibe.  You stand in line and order at the counter, then wait for your number to be called to pick up your food.  There are a few seats inside, as well as seats in The Pavilion and outside the back door.    The first time, I ordered a plain bagel with egg, cheddar, and avocado, and my husband got a sesame bagel with bacon, egg, and American cheese.  After waiting about 10-15 minutes on a busy Saturday, we picked up our order.  The bagels were hot (from the steaming!), and were absolutely delicious.  My avocado bagel was loaded with scrambled eggs, avocado, and cheddar.  It was soft, cheesy, and just wonderful.  My husband's bacon bagel was similarly good, and he preferred the American cheese.    The second visit I ordered Mary's Grubby Bubby, another vegetarian option with a tomato, avocado, Muenster and cheddar cheese, and scrambled egg on a bialy.  I've had bialys before and this one seemed fatter, like the usual bagel, but it was absolutely delicious.  It's my new favorite!  My husband got the standard bacon, egg, and cheese again, but he also got a steamed cream cheese bagel.  I had some of that the cream cheese bagel, and it was so good!    Coffee is served one size, and they have two flavors - bold and light.  The bold satisfied our desire for strong coffee!  We'll definitely be back!",

I ordered Mary's gubby bubby, and the bagel was excellent. It was perfectly steamed and still somewhat soft despite being a denser type of bread. The other ingredients were fresh too, but the bagel really shined.  The bad: it took almost 15 minutes to get my bagel. It wasn't unusually busy and the workers seemed to be going pretty quickly but it was a bit slower than I expected. The taste of the bagel was good but nothing really stood out as outstanding, either. The eggs seemed microwaved or re-warmed and other than the bagel, nothing impressed me. My biggest complaint: the size/price. The bagel sandwich I got was tiny - much smaller than bagels from other bakeries or even what you would get from the supermarket. It was fairly tasty, but for $6+ and a 15 minute wait, I would expect a much larger bagel. Overall, the bagel impressed me, so I might be willing to come back, but everything else left me pretty disappointed.",

I ordered it with jalapeno cream cheese, which definitely would have amped the flavor and made it even better, but it was forgotten.   Speaking of which, the ordering protocol seemed a bit haphazard. The lady making the sandwiches motioned me over and asked what I wanted while she continued to make other orders. Nothing was written down or entered into a computer, which is likely why the above mentioned jalapeno cream cheese was forgotten.   I also tried the blueberry bagel with cream cheese and cinnamon sugar so I could get a glimpse of their sweeter offerings. This one I could do without. Nothing special or different than any other bagel shop.   However, the texture of the grubby bubby \"steamed\" bagel was amazing. I think it must be toasted prior to the steaming, which results in a slight crispy, slightly chewy hot sandwich where even the insides are heated through. Absolutely delicious, and I WILL be back for more.",

My planning was not exactly perfect as I called at 8:01am and ordered 40 bagels for an 8:30am pickup.  Again- not my finest hour.      To give you my backstory- I stop by Owen's any chance I can (time permitting) when I come uptown.  Nothing beats a bagel (\"Jake Deli Home\" personal favorite) and a hot cup of coffee (Snickerdoodle when they have it).  My experience has always been 5 star.  More often than not Pam is behind the counter and is friendly as can be.  But this morning I was ordering for 35 of my friends...and I gave them 29 minutes notice. (#queue the scary music.... dum....dum.....DUMMMMMMM!!!!!)  The lady who took my order (can't remember her name) never once gave me the cliche' answer of \"We need at least an hour's notice for an order of this size.\"  Instead she said \"No problem!  We'll have them ready at 8:30.\"  BOOM!!!  I arrived at 8:34 (traffic ya know) to find my bagels/spreads/flatware/napkins all boxed up and ready to go!  Did I already say BOOM?  Well try this one: #nailedit!  I was in my office and had everything set up before 9:00. The bagels were a big hit.  mAdPrOpS to Owen's!  If you've never been you need to give them a try.  The menu is classic and not something you'd find at a Panera or an Einstein's.  A non-commercial really, really, REALLY good place to eat!",

After circling the parking lot a couple of times and getting a spot snagged from me twice, I remembered seeing a place called Owen's just slightly further down South Blvd.    There was plenty of parking around back and I was immediately in a better mood.  I absolutely loved the vibe in there (not to mention I was almost lured in to Polished to get my nails and toes DID).   There was SO much to pick from on the menu and I was borderlining *hangry* so I figured I'd stick to something quick and easy and ordered a ham, egg and cheese and grabbed an OJ.  While waiting for my food (which wasn't long) I walked through the shop reading all of the fun things that customer's have written on the walls. It took me right down memory lane since as a child my Mom allowed my friends and I to use one room in my wall as a drawing board (crazy, right?)  The staff was nice, service quick and once I got home and inhaled my ham, egg and cheese I considered going back for another.  I will definitely be returning soon!",

The atmosphere isn't quite the same at Owen's as what we had in college, but the sandwiches are just as good.   I read a few people complaining that the bagels are soft, or that the bagels aren't as good as New York's bagels, or even that it wasn't as good as advertised. But most of the complaints I saw were from people that weren't willing to try any of the signature sandwiches that put Bagel & Deli on the map back at Miami. These bagels aren't supposed to be hard, they are steamed so that everything melts together into a gooey delicious treat.   For us, this was our late night and hangover food for four (or more) years. I would never have ordered a bacon egg and cheese and think I'm getting McDonald's or even Panera. That's not what it is, so if that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere.",

They had at least 10 employees working behind the counter, they've installed a new ticket system with order numbers (much more efficient!), and the coffee was 100% stocked. I was even asked by two different employees how my day was going! They've definitely stepped service up and it shows. Thanks, Owen's!",

Love the laid back ambience and the funny/quirky names of their bagel sandwiches. You can order the sandwiches \"as-is\" or build your own. I also love all the amazing flavored cream cheeses; they always have their creative constants like bacon ranch and jalapeno but they also will sometimes throw in another wacky seasonal to see how it's liked. My stand-by recipe is the Mama Cs lox with jalapeno on everything I definitely recommend it if you want something filling, with a good balance of breakfast and lunch. My boyfriends go-to is the Grubby Bubby or the pimento BLT - both are AWESOME and I always have to steal a bite .. Or two. Great place, great bagels -- efficient service whether busy or slow , check this spot out if you haven't !!!",

Needless to say, it's PERFECT. My kind of spot for a good breakfast or any time, for that matter. It's like a Common Market met a grungy record shop and then decided to focus on bagels. I just love this place.   Parking can feel a bit odd since there aren't many spaces out front and it's so close to South Blvd. I'd park where ever you can find an open space.   The menu is extensive with tons of crazy concoctions. There are plenty of more breakfast-style choices but tons that will appeal to the lunch bunch as well. My favorite for an anytime or good breakfast -- Mary's Grubby Bubby. Tomato, avocado, egg, and muenster. I was stoked to see they had some bialy left, too! Tried it on for size and it was amazing. I love making bialy at home and Owen's really hit the spot.   Though I didn't grab a cup of coffee with my breakfast, the roaster they use out of Raleigh had bottles of cold brew in the cooler. Love trying new cold brews and loved that Owen's had this for sale. Picked up a bottle on the way out.   The service is great. Homeboy was nice and took care of like 6 people after I ordered mine. That guy had some hustle, too. He then came out and took care of the entire room while everyone was eating. One man teams like that are hard to come by. My hat's off to you, my friend.   Owen's is numero uno if I'm ever in Southend and craving a bagel. Next up, I'm going for something a little heartier! Can't wait to come back again. It had been too long since my first. Thanks, Owen's!",

I met my husband for lunch and we were both excited to try this place out.  Everywhere we have lived we have found a local bagel place that has had awesome breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  And I love love bagels.  So I was really expecting something great.    Well we walked in and were slammed by the disgusting smell of the nail salon next door.  The whole little shopping center is indoors but the stores themselves are open-air, if that makes sense.  The place next door to Owen's is a nail salon, who does that?!  The last thing I want to smell is chemicals while I'm eating lunch...well maybe dog poo would be worse.  Anyways, the menu looks great, we place our orders, and they are out of almost every bagel.  It was noon and I thought that lunch would be a major deal there and they would have plenty of bread for the only thing they are serving.  So the sandwiches take forever and we go to pay and I order us each a combo with potato salad and a drink.  This is what the guy at the register says \"We don't have that.\"  And then nothing else and just stares at me.  Umm ok so I ask \"Why is it on your menu?\"  He looks at me with the most dumb and confused look on his face.  He picks up a menu and looks at it.  Then he says that they have new owners now and this menu is from the old owners.  Well make some new menus dummy!  They are obviously homemade and could be done in 10 minutes.  And how can you not know what's on your menu?!?  Then I ask what they have for sides and he looks in the display case and says \"We have hummus, chicken salad, and tuna salad.\"  WHAT?!  Jeez this is weird.  I ask \"Those are your sides??\"  I guess it finally clicks in his head what I'm looking for and says they have chips.  Ok I'll take chips, just get me outta here, I'm getting a headache from the nail polish fumes.  To top it all off, the sandwiches were just ok.  I am not a fan of steaming the bagels.  I like when they are crispy outside and chewy inside, the epitome of a bagel in my opinion.  These were just straight chewy.  And I'm pretty sure the place was not very clean.  The girl making the sandwiches was barehanded and answering the phone in the middle of her sandwich making.  Nasty.    I'm sorry for the rant but thank you for listening.  I hope this place can turn it around but it's going to take a lot to get me to go back here for lunch.  Bummer.",

    "text": "Owen's Bagel & Deli is located in \"The Pavilion @ South End\" shopping center, in the South End district of Charlotte. The retail center is oddly designed, with multiple vacancies at the moment.   I thought that the bagels were made on the premises, but a sign at the door announced that the bagels served were actually from New York. Curious about the steamed heating method, I did not allow the sign to deter me from entering, although I was a little concerned about another sign taped to the door where the resto apologized for the \"inconsistency\" of the bagels.   The bagel shop itself looked more like a university dining commons room gone wild, with school banners all about and graffiti over every inch of the walls. As I waited for my order, a simple onion bagel with cream cheese and a breakfast bagel, I spied a poster that read \"War is unsafe for children and living things\".  A rather smart thought, however, on each table was a table tent advertising that they were switching back to styrofoam cups, since patrons did not like the plastic ones. Styrofoam? Does that not hurt living things as well, sitting in landfill, since styrofoam does not decompose? A bit of a contradiction I thought.   A few moments later my order came out and as others commented, the bagel heating process makes the bread chewy, however, I didn't mind, since I was prepared for that. If I wanted a traditional bagel, I would have stopped by the bagel shop a few blocks down the street, however, since this cooking method appeared to be a local thing, I had to try it out.   Overall, nice staff, reasonable prices and interesting decor. The heating method itself, well ... interesting.",

    "text": "Owen's needs to move to a new location.  It is located inside a shabby mini-mall and  there is a nail salon across the hall from this restaurant from which  the odors are quite prevalent. I'm surprised that this is allowed in the health code.  I get a headache from the odors just waiting for my food and will never sit inside the restaurant to eat, which is a shame.  The inside is decorated with all kinds of things that would take an entire day to completely discover.  If the bagel shop had walls that reached up to the ceiling it would help keep the nail salon odors out.  Other than this, the bagels are fresh and there is quite an extensive and creative listing of sandwiches to choose from.  There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan choices.  Service is pretty good.  You can't expect speed when making a bagel so don't be in a hurry when you come here - just plug your nose.",

The melty amazing gooeyness of the cheese on their bagels just makes you want to come back for more. We are so used to Einstein and Brueggers bagels down here. Don't get me wrong I'm fine with a bagel and cream cheese but Owens is different! It's in it's own category for bagels. Also, it's not a franchise, yet.  I remember coming here a few years ago when they first opened their doors and saw \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling written from top to bottom on one of the walls it brought back memories of my childhood and having to memorize that poem.  Overall great place for breakfast or lunch and close to uptown Charlotte right in South end.",

    "text": "Happiness is a warm bagel.  Owen's claim to fame is their bagel steaming process.  Before I came here, I had no idea what bagel steaming entailed, but it beats the heck out of toasting.  Bagels (and bagel sandwiches) go in the steamer as regular bagels.  A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese.   I ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.  Think toasted Quiznos, but with better ingredients.  The wide range of menu items can be a little overwhelming if you're looking at the variety of posters suspended from the ceiling.  Your better bet is to grab a printed menu from the counter.  Perhaps the only thing better than a steamed bagel from this shop is a steamed cookie.  The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.  But if you can talk your server into popping a cookie into the steamer, it comes out chewey and melty like it was fresh from the oven.  Owen's bagel shop might be a little tough to find, but the bagels make it worth seeking out.",

The bagels are amazing and there are options for just about anyone. They tend to get busy on a weekend around lunch time but it's worth the wait.   After a night out, there's nothing better than throwing on some clothes and rolling into Owen's (it's often obvious many others have done the same).   The bagels and toppings taste fresh with I have found is rare for a bagel/breakfast sandwich place in this area.   I would recommend possibly going earlier in be morning or later in the afternoon if going on the weekend unless you want to wait. They simply can't handle the amount of people they get at lunch time to make it move any faster (and that is not there fault at all, it's just the sheer number of people ordering).",

Despite being crazy busy (and from what I understand, it's usually busy but not as busy as it was), the entire staff was focused and got sandwiches done as quickly as possible.  I got the Phish sandwich, which is an Asiago bagel with bacon ranch cream cheese, bacon, egg, onions, pepperjack, tomato, and avocado. It was amazing. The bagel was soft, and the cheese was melted perfectly. My only complaint was that the cream cheese was right on the cusp of being overpowering, but it wasn't quite there so I was still happy with the decision.  We are already planning on going back at least once again before we leave, and it will definitely be on our list of recommendations for people in the future.",

I ordered the classic NY breakfast- which is an egg& cheese on a bagel. I left off the bacon so I could really taste the bagel. First of all I waited for like 45 min for and egg and cheese on a bagel! What the hell? It shouldn't take that long to fry and egg, melt some cheese and throw it on a bagel. Ok so the actual bagel - they somehow managed to make the bagel both crispy and disgustingly SOGGY at the same time? Bagels should not be crunchy OR soggy! It was like eating a Lenders bagel? If I wanted a pack of grocery store bought packaged bagels I would just go buy them. So thumbs down Owen, you fail, and also HOW DARE you compare your bagels to the Bronx, NY!!!",

    "text": "Impressed! I'm from NY and it has been so hard trying to find a decent bagel/breakfast sandwich place down here. Whelp, I found one!   First, the atmosphere is awesome. Calling all hipsters! I felt like I was in a Seattle or a San Francisco coffee shop. They had old magazine covers hung up, things were hand written and drawn. It was very comfy and inviting which makes your experience ten times better!   Second, REAL EGGS!!!! like they crack them themselves. First place I've found down south that does this. I got the Mary's Grubby Bubby (smoked cheddar, muenster, eggs, tomato, avocado on a bialy)....YUM! This had every flavor you want in a breakfast sandwich, sweet and smoky! Usually I like a breakfast meat on my sandwiches but this sandwich doesn't even need it. The smoky cheddar makes you feel like there is bacon on it and the avocado adds just the right amount of sweet. My boyfriend got a sausage, egg, and cheese which was just as delicious-felt like we were back in NY!   Third, the service was awesome! The girl at the register was super friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we were happy. She answered our questions and talked with us about being from NY. There was a big open kitchen allowing you to see the cooking happen which is always a plus! The only suggestion I have is instead of calling out people's orders, ask for names and call those out so it's easier for customers to listen for their own name. But other than that, Owens has 5 stars in my book!",

The bialy bread was okay, but I'm a former New Yorker so I have high standards. I think the tomato was too chewy and watery, I would leave it off. The overall effects of the sandwich were good but not great like the hype I've heard. The dough was a little tough to chew. I would say my other fave bagel place in CLT-- Manhattan Bagel has better quality dough and more bagels like my foodie experiences in NYC.",

My favorite is the Mary's grubby bubby (egg, tomato and avocado) but the hangover helper or classic egg, sausage and cheese taste good on anything. Fresh local coffee is also available self-serve style. Decor inside is pretty neat and unique. Bring a sharpie (or borrow one) if you'd like to add your own personal touch.  Can get really packed later in the mornings, especially on weekends. Parking is available behind the building via a gravel lot. Owen's is on the left when you walk in the building from the lot.",

This hole in the wall is found in the South End area in a shopping area so you really have to look for it. This quick breakfast place has an in & out atmosphere. Order your food, eat there if you choose too, and head out. Owen's has many different bagel options for you to choose from. Some are very strange compilations but so far I haven't had one I didn't like. The best part has to be the names of the Bagels! For example: A Nice Piece of Ash, Hangover Helper, Sweet Caroline, Donkey Punch, and many more! In the pictures below you will see A Nice Piece of Ash and the Angry Steve. If you're looking for some spice to start your morning, Angry Steve is the one for you. I love that they have sprouts on it. Another one I truly enjoy is the Sweet Caroline; it has a blueberry bagel with cinnamon and cream cheese inside. It's one of their simple ones.",

We were just plain-jane's and got sausage, egg + cheese bagels. It's kind of hard to mess that up, so it was good. Nothing earth shattering. I will say, I would give a solid 5 stars to the asiago cheese bagel I had. That thing was outofthisworld. We did have about a bit of a wait for them to make it, so I wouldn't stop in here if you're in a rush to get in+out. It's no McDonald's breakfast. Definitely worth the try, especially if you're feeling randy for same variety.",

    "text": "Though it's kinda hard to find Owen's, you'll be glad once you do. We absolutely love this place. It's awesome--especially for a big breakfast or lunch sandwich when you're super hungover. At least that's what I've found.   Owen's is, when you get down to it, a bagel sandwich place--no more, no less (though they do have some other snacks and sides, like brownies, chips, cookies, and pasta salad). That's why you should come here. Their bagels are fresh and they have an extensive selection, from pumpernickel to Everything.   Their sandwich combos are super creative and equally extensive. Literally, you can order any thing you think of, or something Owen's has already thought of. My girlfriend loves their Hummus and Veggie Bagel. I go for the Reuben, which comes smothered with great cheese and mustard. Check out their menu--it's amazing (with funny names too).   Also, they steam their bagels--with the meat, cheese and veggies/sauce they've already put in it. It's interesting, but usually tastes great, so long as you dont select a sandwich best served cold.",

It's a lot bigger inside than it looks from the outside and there is quite a selection of tasty bagel treats.  They have some really creative combinations that taste good too!  They have an option of toasted or steamed bagel.  My buddy asked what the steamed option meant and the server answered, \"It's steamed and delicious...versus toasted and delicious!\"  Good prices, great vibe, local flavor.  Bagel sandwiches are always better.",

I had opted for the tuna fish with Pepper-jack cheese....I brought it back to my office and the tuna was just old or something it had a fishy taste to it and was pretty dry. In the past I have had the ham and cheese and that was really good on an Asiago Bagel!! I just love how the bagel sticks to the roof of my mouth like fresh white bread does!!   The service has always been friendly and prompt guess I had gone in on an off day!!",

It is definitely worth giving a try... from this point forward I will drive past the major bagel chain on South Blvd. that I've been known to frequent to support this awesomely delicious local restaurant!",

    "text": "I love me some bagels. Large doughy goodness and covered with schmear, please. And Owen's Bagel & Deli certainly delivers - in a big, creative, steamy way.   I've frequented Owen's many a time and I always appreciate the local, hippy vibe that rocks through the scrawled upon walls. It's a very casual haunt, where you can grab some morning breakfast or a quick lunch. You'll see all sorts of customers here - from the church crowd to the hungover college kids. The bagel connoisseurs who work at Owen's are very laid back and friendly. Be prepared to chuckle while reading their menu - they have incredibly creative sandwich names like The Mark Cuban and The Tonya Harding Club.   While I've tried many delicious bagel sammies here, but I always go back to my old standby - the Banana Surprise. It's a cinnamon raisin bagel, slathered with cream cheese, covered in bananas and a dusting of cinnamon sugar. It's incredible. Husband always orders a Mr. Turkey with egg, also a delicious choice. All the bagels and bagel sandwiches are steamed and that makes them super tasty and chewy. Oh, and their coffee is local, which just makes me love them even more.   Head on over to Owen's for a monstrous steamed bagel sandwich, and if you're not full enough, make sure you grab a cookie on the way out - they are the size of your face and a sugary dream.",

The avocado is always perfectly ripe on this perfectly hot bagel sandwich. Their cheesy grits are the best in Charlotte. One day they ran out of grits and we were very disappointed because our 14 month old daughter loves them. They quickly made an extra batch just for us! The manager brought it to our table herself. Good food and great people!!!",

The fillings aren't bad, but the bagels are just plain bad. They're not dense and don't crunch on the bottom like a True bagel should. I actually went twice because I wanted to give them a second chance and see if maybe I just went on a bad day. The second time was just as bad. Not worth the trip or the money.",

Very casual atmoshere- one thing to note, they steam their bagels (no toasting)...When I first learned this I was weary but they are delicious! Oh and the bagels come straight from NY. Try and get there on the early side because they run out of the good bagels (everything) quick on weekends. This has shattered my world on many occasions.",

I'm a huge bagel fan, but had only had them toasted.  A steamed bagel sounded gross to me.  But, I finally tried it and instantly became a big fan.  It has now become my go-to breakfast place. With that being said, despite what a previous reviewer said, they do have a toaster and will toast your bagel, but I would challenge you to try it steamed.  Very good and a different atmosphere than your chain bagel shops.  The snicker doodle coffee is also delicious (even though they don't have it all the time).",
