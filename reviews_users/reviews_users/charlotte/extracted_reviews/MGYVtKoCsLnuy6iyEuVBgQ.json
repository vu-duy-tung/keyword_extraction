After walking into the establishment,I immediately thought that the place had a very nice vibrant atmosphere. Without even looking at the menu I immediately seen something that caught my eye and I knew I had to try it. The Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was very well seasoned and the waffles were exceptional. Definitely looking forward to going back and trying out other options on the menu. I strongly recommend for anyone who's into trying different restaurants with good food to put this one on the list of ones to try. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I ALWAYS have the WORST experience here. Let's begin by incorrect hours listed on the website. And on any given day they could be closed or out of menu items. Next, the service is ALWAYS poor. I brought friends from out of town for a good southern brunch. We waited over an hour or more for our food. Two meals came out (and they were cold) about 30-40 mins later the rest of the meals came to the table. We had no utensils to eat with and after ten additional minutes of waiting on silverware, we received plastic wrapped forks.  Most of our orders were incorrect, ALL OF OUR FOOD WAS COLD...asked to see a manager. He/she never came. This is such a disgrace and embarrassment for any establishment to carry on in this manner. I only continue to come with the good hopes that things will get better and I to support a black owned business. This place is awful and I wish it really improves with quality of service.",

We went for a brunch, a friend was hosting, and it was a nice atmosphere and music was great! Our server just struggled greatly to be attentive. It took us nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 40+ to get our food. The food was great when it finally arrived. I think they need to invest in more kitchen supplies to accommodate a large brunch crowd. I had the red velvet waffle and chicken and the chicken was amazing! Super flavorful! The waffle was alright, fluffy. They have got drinks although they seem a little pricey to me. $12-15 on one cocktails and $5 mimosas. Overall it was a nice experience and I love supporting Black-owned businesses, but they have some areas of improvement. I will go again thought and give them a second try.",

    "text": "This is basically a modern southern cuisine place. I came here for girls night out and the ambiance is perfect for that occasion. I ordered the pomegranate wings and 7th street sunrise? drink and split some fries with a friends.. I do really appreciate the fact that they changed the base liquor from Bacardi O to Bacardi Silver at my request - no extra charge. God because the thing cost me $12 anyway. The wings were pretty decent, I've have much better. The sauce was too sweet for my taste buds. I guess I had different expectations since I've made pomegranate wings at home and my sauce was great (not trying to toot my own horn, but..).The ranch dressing though is pretty great. It definitely tastes homemade. It would be nice if you get more than 2 tablespoons worth in a serving though. I'm not a HEAVY ranch user and definite went through two containers with half an order of fries and 4 of the 8 wings that came with my order. The fries were pretty good. Better than average but not too spectacular. If you come here, be prepared to either wait until people leave to park or pay to park - might want to carpool. They have approximately 20 spaces dedicated to their restaurant. One thing I DESPISE is paying to park and then having to pay for my meal/drink. You should get at least $5 off if you have to pay to park. I will probably return here at least once to try something else on the menu, but it's not high on my come-back list. It's a little expensive to me for what you get.  **Side note** They tried to get us to come back and watch the football game there. They have about 3 40-inch or so TV's. I don't think this is the best game spot unless you come to be more social than pay attention to the game.",

I ordered grilled whiting fish with two sides. My order was wrong twice and they gave me fried. The third time it was white, pale, no seasoning and not grilled. The cook, who you can see I might add, proceeds to tell me he can't grill it...yet that is an option on the menu for that dish! On top of that, they allowed a barefooted man off the street, play his violin (badly, out of tune) and he continued to bother patrons going to their tables. Clearly this man had issues and needed to be asked to leave but they did nothing. When I spoke with the manager about my experience his body language and attitude was nonchalant and he could care less.  Luckily, the server didn't charge me for the fish. 7th district: lack of customer service, lack of professionalism and inconsistent food quality sums it up. Read between the lines of the other reviews below...I didn't and wasted my time.",

Unfortunately, we did not enjoy our time because apart from each other's company there was nothing. We ordered a long island and red stripe. We kept waiting but 30 minutes later another server stops by and seems concerned...she asks if we had been helped and we explained to her that we were still waiting. She took our food orders which was the tacos. After another 15 minutes we got the tacos and the drinks at the same time. The tacos were cold. I was over it and let the server know that we were not eating cold tacos. It was just awful service. I think they need experienced servers and their spot could thrive!",

About half of what people ordered was good such as my grandmas salmon which was amazing and the other half was just ok or inedible like my cousin's grilled chicken breast which was dry and had NO seasoning. When the plate came out you could just tell it was going to be disgusting without even biting into it.  I ordered the spicy Cajun shrimp pasta. It was pretty bland and mostly just tasted of spice with no real Cajun flavors coming through. Service was decent until it came to getting the check which took almost 30 minutes or so. Probably wouldn't recommend to my friends nor would I come back. This place turns into a hookah bar after 8:30ish as well which ruined the atmosphere for me. They bring in a DJ who plays music way too loud but at least the music choices were decent.",

Finally after telling the server I don't want my food AT ALL .. we finally have attention paid to us the manager comes over and tells us he will give out entry fee back and comp our meal which still comes out 20 minutes later :: because my friend who enjoyed their lackluster attempt to make up for it I gave this a one star review and I still refused to eat the complimentary food due to the seriously poor service that happened in my first and I guarantee only time I will be here",

We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn't very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn't received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I'll pass.",

Our server INITALLY approached up promptly and with a smile i'll add. But that was the first and last time Sharon came to the table in a timely manner. Coughs AND rolls eyes. Ordered two waters and a drink. Took 15min. unfortunately we were not ready to order when we returned. I honestly could tell you how long we waited this long but i will say i looked around changed seats and looked around some more. Did not see her anywhere by the way. She comes & takes our order. Our apps come i get the salmon bites, which were amazing! We also ordered the cheese sticks. She placed the apps on the table so we then ask for marinara sauce and lol her reply is so we dont have any but i can go look (somewhere) to see id we have some. Do you want some? Umm what do you think & why didnt you do that already? Anyway, brings it. Few min later she brings out ONE of TWO entrees the whiting, shrimp and fries. Not the lemon pepper salmon, mashed, and collards. (Side eye). I literally waited 15min to get my food after the first entree was dropped. Not once did she check on either one of the entrees after she placed them. She goes MIA again! Who knows how long. She finally comes past us so we ask for a box and the check. She then brings a check with gratuity added for a party of 2 lol yall when i say i was weak i was lol. So you give TERRIBLE service then try to steal $15 from me? Haha NO! She tales so long to come back i then got the manager woman that was near by to run it AND i asked her is grat auto added on parties of two? She twist up her face & said no then looks at the check & asks how many people were in our party lol.. we say TWO lol.. she then says after a certain time lol.. it was right b4 11 lol .. then she says she'll adjust it lol.. just lying. Lol.. so the server drops the check & i ask her for a bag (rolls eyes extremely) she goes in the back somewhere so i ask another server for the bag then BOOM theres a bag! Lol the food was great but the service was TERRIBLE & the server is a thief lol",

They played good R&B music that was low enough to still maintain a conversation with your dinner guest without raising your voice. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which was pretty good. The next time I go, I'll ask them to remove the large green and red peppers from my dish. The wait for the food was not long at all and the servers were very attentive. Oh! They also have free parking in front as well as behind the restaurant.",

    "text": "Highly disappointed because this place has so much potential, the ambiance is very nice. The menu looks good however majority of the food items are fried. The cocktail menu is very small. They display a few \"specialty drinks\" and list a very small selection of wine. Waitress couldn't tell me which beers they served. They should be more familiar with the bar menu or just simply provide the customer w/ a full bar menu.   The biggest issue I had here was the service, or lack there of. The food took an extremely long time to come out, Over a 30 minute wait period. We had a table of 6 people. The waitress brought out one dish. And did not bring out the other 5 dishes until 15 minutes later. I ordered the grilled chicken. It was extremely dry and looked as if it had been sitting out. And not to mention the plate was cold. My friend ordered the same dish and her chicken looked and tasted as if it was freshly cooked, hot and juicy.   I asked the waitress to bring me back a plate of hot food. She took my plate in which I had already eaten off of and brought back the EXACT same plate. I asked was it just popped into a microwave? She said no, I saw them put it on the stove. I sent the plate back again. How unsanitary?!?   The manager comes over (with my same plate in his hand) and says \"what's the issue\" (with an attitude) I told him what the issue was. He asked me did I want another piece of chicken. At that point I did not want anything else from this establishment.",

They were cold and it was an overall waste of $40 will not return! Could've done a better job and had more had I made them myself!",

The Lava Lamp was delicious and fruity and the presentation was very nice. The Salmon Bites were delicious. My friend and I had been enjoying the smooth, laid-back atmosphere and hadn't realized, they had switched to the late night menu. We were still able to order the Shrimp and Grits though. Being from the the North everyone tries to make you try grits in and I loathed it every time. Grits had always tasted like flavorless baby food. One bite of these Shrimp and Grits though, and I was hooked!! The service was very punctual, professional, and knowledgeable. This restaurant is definitely comparable to the high-end restaurants in New York. I wish they would open one in Myrtle Beach but I have no problem travelling to Charlotte because I know 7th District will not disappoint!",

We received our food without any silverware and had to go up and get our own after waiting an additional 10 minutes. The manager had no sense of urgency to come over to us and the server explained how they didn't expect any type of crowd which is the reason why service was slack. I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles , too bad I couldn't enjoy it because of not having silverware or syrup. Never returning and I wouldn't suggest that you do either.",

He is the host, server, and bartender which is causing service to be extremely slow. The mimosas are basically glasses of orange juice and it takes so long to get another round it isn't really worth it. The grits were good, but this experience is terrible. I ordered potatoes that never came out. Some of my friends had to send their waffles back because they were hard. A table has walked out because of the slow service and my party is getting more and more aggravated. Again, Forest was great. He has been running around nonstop and in good spirits, but it seems like management set him up for a failure today. Towards the end the manager was present. She never stopped by the table but she did help fix some of the checks that were incorrect. I'm assuming she was the manager even though she was walking around with uggs on.",

I was seated immediately and I ordered an Amaretto and Orange Juice.  They were out of Amaretto.  That was disappointing, but I can understand that they may have sold out from the night before.  My food arrived.  The salmon was grits looked perfect, but the french toast did not look like it was cooked thoroughly.  Even the server mentioned to me that it didn't look right to her but the cook said to bring it out anyway.  I sent it back and when it was brought back out, it still looked uncooked.  Issue #1 - the french toast being undercooked.  French toast is something that is SO basic, so to screw it up TWICE is unacceptable.  Issue #2 - I'm fairly certain that the Owner or Manager could not have been present or have been made aware of this because there was no concession.  There was no apology or an offer of something else.  I wont say that I'll never go back because their salmon and grits is really good!  And so is their french toast (when it's actually cooked all the way).",

Then the birthday girls food was cold and she had to return it. The manager then got upset because of an item in the gift bag that we did NOT know we couldn't have as it wasn't disclose prior to us getting there. She proceeded to tell us very rudely to put our items away and that she would yell at the hostess for us having it! The hostess knew NOTHING! Why blame her for something she knew nothing about! She then proceeded to reprimand her in front of all the guests (very unprofessional)! And then come to find out from the workers that this wasn't even the real 'manager' and that she frequently gets complaints from guests! This was my first time going to this restaurant but after the first impression they left, I will not be returning. Your guests shouldn't leave feeling like an inconvenience to you!",

But $15 for a drink and cold ass shrimp and grits. (The shrimp and grits are better at Midnight Diner and cheaper) I was unhappy and really don't like that they add on the tip for late nights. So I don't know if I'd go back..",

Came in for brunch and bottomless mimosas and I couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the food. I had a breakfast bowl and the home fries were amazing, but the whole dish was excellent. My sister and her friend both got the chicken wings and waffles and the chicken was amazingly well seasoned. I didn't really have high expectations as I've never been to this place before, but the quality of food and the taste was so good I just wasn't expecting it.",

Beautiful mosaic tiled open kitchen with chandeliers scattered throughout the space. Brunch menu is pretty limited with a couple of seafood dishes such as shrimp and grits and other combinations with grits. We decided to get the main attraction \"chicken and waffles\". Chicken was well seasoned, waffles were good. Hubby got the red velvet which came with came with a cream cheese/citrus drizzle. I opted for the original which was good with honey and maple syrup. Overall good experience would return.",

I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait. I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the \"sex sells\" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally.  To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.   This place will not be recommended to anybody I know The food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits.",

The food was good. Definitely better than average.  I got chicken and waffles that both came out hot.  The chicken probably should have been let to sit in the basket for a minute because when you opened it up you got a fair amount of grease.  The waffles were good, but fell apart quickly.  I'm not sure of that's a batter quality issue or letting it stay a little longer in the iron. But again over all the food service, and atmosphere was good. They also have an awesome live band on Saturday - keyboard, saxophonist, violinist and songstress, that played a delightful mix of old and new school. We were pretty close so it made conversation difficult, but it was a nice treat since they started at the end of dinner.  The only negatives were that there is no dress code, so it had a pretty young lookinf, acting, and dressing crowd.  I'm in my mid 30s and was probably at the end of the age curve.  Secondly the prices are too low by about $2-$3 per plate. That would normally be a good thing but for the clientele I hope the want to have and to stay in business they may want to raise their prices.",

One of the bar hops came by and cleared off my drink before I was done with it.   Our food took over an hour to come out. While we were waiting my friend asked to speak with the manager about how long we had been waiting. He had excuse after excuse as to why it was taking so long.  When the food finally came out, the burger that my friend ordered medium rare came out well done so she sent it back and she waited another hour and a half til it came back out.  In the end our food was comped and we only paid for our drinks.  I read other reviews which seem like a general consensus that this place could use some tweaking. I see the potential so I really hope they get it together.",

As I entered I was greeted & sat immediately by the hostess and shorty after the waitress came and brought me water & asked if I needed anything else while I waited. Once my friend arrived our waitress returned to get her drink order. We decided to get the Crab Balls as an appetizer and they were great, we even got a second order. For our entrees she ordered the Shrimp & Grits with a side order or Mac & Cheese and I ordered the Salmon & Grits with a side order of Brussels sprouts. Unfortunately we were both pretty disappointed but we only sent back the Mac & Cheese which we didn't like at all. We also didn't like the grits which to me had like a milky/creamy yet grainy texture to them and no flavor not even with the teriyaki sauce that was on mine could do it justice so I just ate the salmon which was pretty good. And she just ate the shrimp out of hers. The brussel sprouts were alright but I enjoyed them the most after the crab balls. When our waiter came to clear the plates she asked us if we liked it and we were honesty and she thanked us for the feedback. A few minutes later she surprised us with a piece of chocolate cake for our birthday which was pretty good. Overall the service was great and I would go back but I wouldn't recommend any of the entrees that came with grits in my opinion.",

The food was rich and presented very nicely. The owner made his way around to all of the tables to introduce himself and thank everyone for attending. The head chef is Chef Leon and he's great. It's worth stopping by for food and a wonderful atmosphere.",

There was a large group of us (15+) but upon attempting to order and get our mimosas flowing, we noticed that there was only ONE waiter in the restaurant. Aside from the cooks, it was just him. He was the host, waiter, food runner, complaint taker and everything in between. Forest, the waiter was on his game and did the very best he could, but the restaurant had him set up for failure. He mentioned he doesn't typically work brunch but was called in for the day. They should've called in a few other waiters as well, cause I mean, DUH?! It's NYE and there's going to be a crowd, period. One table even walked out because they weren't waited on quick enough. As for the food, the fish could've been seasoned a whole lot more but the grits were straight. The mimosas were in all actuality orange juice with a splash of bubble and idk about you, but I like my mimosas with just a dash of orange juice, because unlimited mimosas should have you day drunk (that's the point isn't it?) Anywho, our waiter did his best and overall the experience was lackluster and left much to be desired. If it weren't for Forest, I would've given 2 stars.",

If you ask a waitress for anything and she is not the one serving your table, she will just look at you like how dare you.

It got to the point that I would go almost every other weekend for dinner with friends, brunches with family and we've even celebrated birthdays and engagements here.  But the fact that this is not the first time I've been disappointed by them leads me to this.  I went with my friends to 7th on 4/6/2019, arriving shortly after 1am. We sat down fairly quickly, was greeted by the waiter and ordered our drinks, which took a very long time to arrive. One of my friends ended up having to return her drink as her soda was flat. How? I'm not sure as we ordered the same drink. It took them over 10 minutes to bring her a replacement but understanding it was a busy night due to the festivities that occurred in CLT AND the fact that they were short staff, we gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to order. After placing our orders we waiting for approximately 45 minutes to an hour for the waiter to come back and say that they ran out of something and could not complete my friends order. Why wasn't this confirmed 45 minutes ago? She is handed a menu to order another item and the waiter never came back, that is until we flagged him down. She placed her order and we wait.   7th has an open view to the kitchen and guests are able to view when orders are up for the wait staff to deliver to customers. Our table faced that view and noticed that one order was up. It sat there for about 25 minutes before it was picked up by OUR waiter. We watched it for 25 minutes! Hoping that he wouldn't, he picked up the plate and proceeded to our table to drop off the food. I kindly asked him not to, as 1. It has been sitting up there for almost a half hour and 2. Nobody else's food was ready. I advised him we wouldn't be able to take that order.   It is now almost 2:45am and we still do not have any food. The waiter comes to our table and says that the manager/owner is going to come talk to us. I'm assuming it's about the timing of our food arrival. When we finally got to the speak with the manager, there was no apology, no ETA on when we would get our food, and he offered a discount. A DISCOUNT!?!? Mind you, still no food. At this point, that further disappointed us and our table just got up and left after advising another waitress to just cancel our order, as our waiter was nowhere to be found. There was absolutely no consideration, on the restaurants' end, of our time. We've been there since 1pm, with bad service, no re-fills, no ETA on food arrival; and no apology, even from management, for the experience, and it's now 3am and we have to leave, still with no food, disappointed!    The one star is truly for the food and the ambiance.",

    "text": "Yaaaaaay!!!!! A new spot with flavor? Bring it on! Visited here on a Friday night to have a drink and a quick bite with a friend. To sum it up, I loved the decor - a sultry black and red with a beautiful floor to ceiling tile wall. We were seated immediately and ordered drinks. Their signature drinks are a little pricey, ranging from $11-15. However, they had drink specials (Friday is ladies night) and there were $5 cocktails. Had Bacardi rum w/ Pineapple and grenadine $5.00 and they weren't stingy with the booze. One was enough for a small buzz to relax.   My friend ordered something and was informed within minutes that it wasn't available for that night. New business problems. Get it together. He then ordered a salmon Caesar salad. Pretty good, but nothing special. The piece of salmon wasn't particularly large. They originally served it with Ranch dressing. Simple mistake that was fixed quickly.  I ordered the crab, spinach, and artichoke  dip and the salmon bites. The salmon bites were more of a salmon salad that was fried. Easy to bite into and well seasoned. The crab dip came with freshly cooked pita chips. The chips were Great, the right taste and texture, being chewy and not too crunchy. The dip however lacked in crab meat. I think it was $8, so you get what you pay for. I think there was a healthy amount of crab flavoring in there as opposed to actual meat. That being said, the dip was still tasty. And because there was a significant delay in my food being served, the manager comped my meal. I didn't have to ask or complain. She was just on top of her game and noticed that I Still wasn't eating after 30+ minutes. Excellent customer service points there.  This same night, I came back with my girls because they were hungry after a long night. It was probably 1:45 and the kitchen was already closed. However, the owner offered to fix us some wings. We didn't take him up on the offer, but the gesture was very nice. He invited us to come back and handled the situation well. Great experience. This restaurant will be around for a long time to come.  Having not heard of this place, I was impressed that they were already so busy. Excellent place to come and kick it on a Friday night.",

I thought it was strange that when I made reservations a few weeks in advance that I didn't get an immediate confirmation (btw it came the next day) but now I know why the restaurant fills up fast and they take a lot of reservations. We saw so many people who just walked in looking for a table but couldn't get one.  The ambience was tasteful and has a young millennial feel. The food is awsome, we started off with some fried chicken wings that were just right and had a lot of seasoning. My wife had had the shrimp and grits. The grits were creamy and the shrimp was seasoned well. I had the seafood platter with fried Whitings, Shrimp and waffle fries. The batter was light and the seafood was seasoned perfectly.",

    "text": "So I tried this place out on a Saturday night and I have to be honest, I was not impressed. I was in the mood for crab legs and a good drink but honestly I was not happy with either. My friends and I (party of 3) arrived at the restaurant at 9 p.m. We waited almost 15 min before anyone even acknowledged us to put us on a waiting list. Once we were on the waiting list we had about a 30 min wait, which wasn't terrible. However, the waiting area is sooooo tiny! So we waited in our cars. Once we were seated at our table our server came over fairly quickly and was very nice! Although she wasn't that attentive throughout our visit she was friendly everytime she checked in on us. I had crab legs, corn and potatoes which were average, a drink which was given to me in a plastic cup, and crab bites which were brought out AFTER my entree and they were lukewarm. I also NEVER got any silverware the entire time I was there. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were not as nice as I expected. I'm glad I checked this place out before bringing my boyfriend back for an event. Prices are not terrible. My drink, appetizer and entree came to almost $50 I believe and I gave the server $60 including the tip. They do not skimp on the alcohol when they make your drink so that was a plus. The music was also REALLY good. A dj came in about 10 p.m so if you do decide to give this place a try on a Saturday night, make a reservation for 10 p.m. Hope this helps.",

My gripe w/CLT not enough great Mac & Cheese...but this place does a damn good job.  Bar options...slim...but you really walk in here b/c you smell chicken...like a savory, looking for ya grandma chicken aroma from the street.   Good for a low key, chill, out of the hustle bustle of Uptown. Everyone is friendly, attentive and plus they have multiple tvs around the bar.",

    "text": "Update: April 2017  - I came here in the evening when they had a DJ.  Today I tried the truffle Parmesan chicken wings and the four chess mac and cheese.  I was not disappointed.   A friend of mine decided we would have brunch here on Sunday.  I was happy when I saw salmon croquettes on the menu but decided on the chicken and waffles.  The waffle option for red velvet won me over.  Ok, I was disappointed in the waffles. I think the citrus cream cheese drizzled on it took away from True red velvet flavoring.  However, the chicken was good!    My friend ordered the salmon and grits.  It can with teriyaki sauce - how odd.  Anyway, it was a nice meal and I left full.  Next time I will stick to the traditional waffles or actually try the salmon croquettes.",

And not only did I not like it, it was so displeasing it was inedible. I asked for it to be extra crispy, it was soft as a pillow. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked in burnt grease. This plate was a disaster. Actually not a single person at our table enjoyed their food. The Salmon Bites tasted like they took canned shredded Salmon(SHREDDED!!), balled it, breaded it, fried it with no seasoning. We all left hungry. We also all left still waiting on a drink we ordered as soon as we'd arrived that never made it to our table. The waitress brought us our checks without the drinks on it and said if the bartender still makes them before you leave, i'll bring them over to you for free. Did not believe for a second that the bartender was still working on our drinks. Especially when we saw people at the bar getting drinks pretty quickly. How do you prepare bar drinks before your diners? Doesn't make sense to me. Horrible experience, will never return for any reason.",

When we first arrived, We had multiple wait staff attending to our table. They were very patient and wanted to make sure that we were ok. Our waitress ended up being Monique who is GM of 7th district. She served with a smile on her face. The place got pretty busy after a few hours and the owner, Josh Vereen, was also on the floor serving.   I ordered Ny strip steak; it was over cooked so I sent it back. The second preparation was overcooked as well. If you like your steak red or pink in the middle, I would recommend ordering under your preferred cooking temperature. I ordered my steak medium but it was prepared to medium well temperature. If I were to order a steak again from 7th district , I would order medium rare. I tried the crab cakes which were seasoned well with little filler and a good amount of crab and the chicken and waffles; chicken was seasoned well but waffle was gummy. Overall look of the place was simple but elegant. A Lot of people attended the event but there was enough space for folks to move around and socialize.   I will definitely be back to experience the live music on the weekends. I would also like to check out their happy hour (after 4pm) during the week that offers $5.00 plates and drink specials.",

We sat at the table for 15 minutes without a Server to at least welcome us or take drink orders or bring water. Needless to say when we complained and got someone over we had to order drinks and food at the same time. Al though our Server just came to work when she was thrown to us(Kai) she was pleasant and helpful. Now back to the food....the Whiting and Grits were perfect and the Chicken and Waffles were cooked to perfection. My Lava Drink was cute for the effects not taste.   Updated 3-3-19 just noticed that there's an 18% gratuity that is added to ALL checks hence why their customer service SUCKS because they're gonna get a tip regardless.",

Mind you this wasn't my first bad experience but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and try to support a black owned establishment.   The only okay thing that happened that night was the fact me and my friends were sat fairly quickly. We waited probably 15-20 minutes to place our drink orders. The drinks came another 20 minutes later and my coke had no carbonation so that was another 10 minute wait. Ok no huge biggie but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth literally. So the waiter takes our order and we waited an hour,which was understandable because it was a lot of people in the building, to only be advised I'm sorry the crab balls that were ordered was out of stock. Are you kidding me ?! We waited an hour for nothing. So he asked my friend what would she like instead but being as it was her first time there she needed the menu which added even more time for us to wait. He did bring the menu back promptly but he never returned to take her order. He finally was bringing other tables food and we had to wave him down. At this point she only wanted friends and we asked about our food because it had been more than enough time for it be done. He said it was coming up shortly and the manager was also coming over to speak to us about the issue. The waiter tried to give us a plate of food that had been sitting on the counter for over 20 minutes. We refused it and continued to watch people that came after us eat, pay, and leave. As the manager came over to our table we vent our frustrations and this man had the nerve to stop in the middle of the conversation to have a friendly chat with another customer. At this point we were done. We wasted two hours and only received bad service because we never got a refill, no food, and a manager that couldn't careless.  We only stayed because we all were drinking before we got there. I'm also sad because my fiancee actually proposed to me there last year and we had planned on having our 1 year anniversary dinner there. I will never return and I will share my experience on EVERY platform including the BBB.",

They were good. Initially it was suppose to be six people in my party however it ended up being four people. I arrived at 6pm, was greeted, and asked if I could get a table for six, no problem. I would recommend if you have a large group. The atmosphere is cool; R&B music was being played and it was great music. I saw a DJ come in a few minutes before we left. Our waitress was pleasant.

The table next to us waited even longer. The manager kept insisting the food was coming after I told him i want to leave, but it didn't. Our server never gave us refills and seemed clueless to her job. When the food did come, it was one by one and my order was not correct. In this case, you offer some type of incentive to customers that are unhappy but that wasn't the case. We paid the full price for food that came with a poor experience. This place has potential, but terrible structure. Had the manager offered us anything and made us feel valued, i'd return. But since my friends and I were not valued, I'll never comeback nor recommend this restaurant.",

The restaurant was not full nor did they have a private function that bought it out (I asked). We were then told that us ladies could dine if we weren't with the \"clown ass n-word\" we were with! I simply could not believe what was happening!! I will yell from the rooftops till I'm blue in the face for everyone to stay far away from this place until it is shut down!!!",

He said that he has a veggie pasta and also a veggie patty for a burger if I wanted one with fries. I got the pasta with a butter garlic sauce. It was delicious and I recommend it if you aren't against consuming dairy. He said he was out of olive oil to make the sauce dairy free. My friend got the whiting with grits. The grit dishes are quite popular so if you like seafood I'd suggest them. I also tried a grapefruit peach wine that was delicious.",

I normally don't leave bad reviews for Black owned businesses, but I was so turned off by the way one of the workers tried to hustle me into paying $40 for parking when he just charged my friends $20. Admittedly it was All Star weekend, but I should not have to pay to park in your lot to patronize your business in the first place. Then, if we did not pay they were going to charge a fee to enter. There was no event going on for them to charge. They were simply being greedy and trying to capitalize off of the weekend. Additionally the service was extremely slow for the lack of crowd, and there was an automatic gratuity for a party of 4.",

    "text": "On Saturday 8/27 after leaving the Southern Women's Show at the Charlotte Convention Center, my party of 4 agreed to have lunch in Uptown. My niece checked several media sites for both reviews and operating hours and affirmed that 2pm was when the restaurant opened. We arrived promptly at 2pm. There was no private event signage anywhere, and as we entered a hostess came up to the reservation desk, asked how many in our party and proceeded to seat us. First thing we noticed was a very heavy smell of GAS which permeated the entire restaurant. Windows and fans were on as if trying to clear out the horrible smell. Still we remained and while reviewing the menu, someone came out of the kitchen stating, \"they were closed for a private event and we could not remain\". In amazement we looked around and we four were the only people in the place. No obe else from the \"private party\" were there. No signs, decorations, balloons ir ither guests. As we gathered up our belongings and got up from a well worn sofa, no one said sorry for the inconvenience or even offered us any token of appreciation for stopping by in the first place. Parking is minimal at best , having counted exactly 7 car spaces directly in front, and other reserved parking at the building rear  which clearly established parking could lead to your car being booted. For a first impression, I was not impressed, leaving both hungry, annoyed and irritated. Perception is Reality in the hospitality business and this first and last visit made things clear. This is not a customer centric restaurant, and the employees lack the appropriate skill set to appease clientele. I will patronize establishments that clearly want my business!",
