My side of fried rice came out in less than a minute (which leads me to believe that it is precooked). It was kind of gummy. Finished my rice before my sushi even came out. Ten minutes after I finished my rice, still no sushi. The waitress did not come back to check on me or to tell me how much longer before my order came up. Seeing as how she walked by me several times and saw the empty rice bowl. I finally had to ask, to which she replied oh it's ready. Then proceeded to go do other things. I also asked for eel sauce and was given soy sauce. The waitress brought me my check without ever asking if I need or want anything else. The shrimp sauce was good. I definitely will not come back here.",

After she served our food, she only came back to the table to deliver our checks. Never asked how our meal was, never offered to get us some thing different, never apologized nothing. Save yourself, your money and your time. If I could give them a NEGATIVE 5 I would. No wonder why the place was empty (only 2 other tables in the entire place)!!!

This location especially, has been filled by several Japanese Sushi Restaurants; none of which have lasted.   The void left by the last restaurant, Yotto has been filled by, well essentially the same restaurant with a new name and maybe new owner. Difference being though, we might now have a winning formula.  While the decor has changed very little, one thing that has changed is the food and prices. I still haven't tried the sushi, but everything on the hibachi isn't too shabby.  From what I can tell, the entire restaurant still has the same exact layout. I don't know if there was any remodeling whatsoever. Since it's a lunch oriented fast food style sit down restaurant, there isn't a dire need for aesthetics and stylish furniture. And those costs savings seem to have trickled down to you and I.",

    "text": "We wanted to explore something new, and use a coupon from our Charlotte Citipass book.  Since we were getting our hair cut right across the street from MAI Japanese restaurant, we decided to give them a try.  It was about 5:15pm on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only customers in the place so I thought we'd surely have a good experience.  The place looked clean, despite the decor being too busy and distracting.     We looked over the small menu and quickly knew what we wanted.  Since we'd never been there before, I wanted to try both the sushi and the hibachi options.  We ordered 1 order of California rolls, 2 crab sticks, 1 hibachi chicken combo meal and 1 hibachi shrimp combo meal.  The soup, salad and \"shrimp\" sauce all came out at the same time, which I wasn't thrilled with.  Then very shortly after that we got 2 orders of California rolls and 2 crab sticks.  I alerted the waitress that we only ordered 1 order of California rolls, and she seemed very confused...  so much so that she brought our sushi order forms back to the table and asked my husband if he'd marked the sheet...  which he had not.  I guess they re-used a previous sushi order form without checking it first?  Maybe they were trying to upsell in hopes that we'd just go ahead and pay for it anyway.  I dunno, but as he doesn't like California rolls, he certainly wouldn't have ordered them.  So she took the unwanted order away and shortly our hibachi entrees arrived.  They're served on plain, round, white plates which made the food look awful.  The first thing I noticed was that the vegetables looked oily, but not seasoned.  My guess was proven correct after the first bit of slippery, tasteless onion.  (So- if you like tasty, seasoned Japanese food, I'd highly recommend at least paying the upcharge for teriyaki.)  I was thankful that I'd ordered the sushi because I was less than impressed by my hibachi entree.  My fried rice was just plain nasty.  It tasted somehow soggy and watered down??  I dunno- but it's the only time I've ever had inedible rice from an Asian establishment.  I got 4 sweet carrot slices on my plate, and they we're hard.?.  Like they'd been reheated in a microwave or something...  wasn't good.  The chicken was just plain, hard chicken chunks with very little seasoning on them and the zucchini and onion mixture was oily and tasteless.  I tried dipping everything into the \"shrimp\" sauce, but as it was mostly mayonnaise, it proved to be no help at all.  I wondered if they had any ginger sauce like Kabuto and Nakato have, but judging from the pale, watery ginger dressing I had on my salad, I didn't even waste my breath to ask for any.  Ok, so we finish and we're ready for the check.  I give the waitress my coupon and she comes back with my bill showing where they'd taken $6.99 off.  My coupon said \"up to $10.00 off\" and with everything we'd bought, I was curious as to why I didn't get the full $10.00 taken off the bill, so I asked.  The waitress just said she didn't' know, and stared at me.  Being as that in no way answered my question, I asked her to bring the coupon back to we could look at it together.  She came back with a woman that appeared to be a manager and she told me that they take off the least expensive entree (which was my hibachi chicken for $6.99) so that did make sense to me and I was fine with her answer until she said \"...  that's how marketing works...\"  That comment pissed me off because all I could think was, \"well, actually, MAI paid to have a coupon in the Citipass book to draw business into their store and hopefully create return business and positive word of mouth advertising...  but after our experience in MAI;  that manager let a $3.00 question seal the deal that 2 fat DINKs (Double Income No Kids) won't be returning for repeat business and we certainly won't be telling our friends or the 200 employees that read my monthly intercompany newsletter where I share local restaurant reviews...\"    I wanted very much to say...    you never once asked us how our meal was and then you chose to let your greed for $3.00 hold up many, many potential future dollars...  \"No, THAT's how marketing fails!...\"",

What I liked best was that you could see the cooking/prep area and it appeared well kept and well organized. I could see every piece of my food being made. I sat at the sushi bar. My waitress was friendly, she smiled, checked on me and came over a couple of times to make sure I had everything I needed and last, asked me if I liked what I had. That was a plus, I tipped her.  I just had water with my meal, but I started out with miso soup.Then I enjoyed a spicy salmon hand roll which consisted of rice cucumber, avocado and a spicy sauce that resembled hirachi hot pepper sauce but not eye watering hot. The hand roll was good and the seaweed broke off nicely with every bite.  Southside roll, which was flavorless tempura salmon & cucumber, rice side out. It was creative but they could've added a little seasoning to either the fish or the tempura batter and they could've julienned the cucumbers because they were thick. Last I had the Ocean roll which was tuna, crab, roe and cream cheese deep fried & drizzled with spicy aioli. That was good. I'd get it again.  Overall I liked the place, I would definitely go back and tell my friends to check it out. It's a nice date night place too.",

The veggie tempura sat in oil because it wasn't drained well before putting in the container. The pork gyoza was horrible. First most places pan fry but deep fry. The flavor tasted liked the pork was expired. The side salad with ginger was literally lettuce with nothing on it, the ginger dressing was fine. I won't be returning as simple appetizers should not be such poor quality.",

We got our sushi rolls only to discover it wasn't ours. The waiter told us it would be 5-10 minutes. After 30 mins and watching 5 to go orders go out the door we got our food....it was horrible. We have never left sushi at the table. I told the waiter that the food was horrible, totally not worth the wait and to bring the check. There was no discount or apology for us waiting an hour and half for sushi!  Sushi was slimy and tasted fishy. They ONLY received the one star so I could post this review.",

    "text": "After living close to this place for years and never once going to check it out, I finally happened to stop in for lunch now even though I've moved across town.  Go figure.  Anyway, I wasn't missing much based upon my experience there.    It was about noon when I stopped in and the lunch crowd was starting to fill the place up.  I was offered any open table which was nice (there were only a couple available).  The place was full groups of folks that appeared to be mostly from the nearby business park.  I sat myself on down and waited for about 5 minutes before I got my water, and then took a look over the menu.  No lunch specials to be found here which I found extremely odd given that this is obviously a spot that does a lot of business during lunch.  Okay, whatevs.    I ordered up a couple of sushi rolls, which I verbally ordered and then was advised to mark on the paper sushi menu.  That was a bit absurd to me, we're going to waste a whole sheet of paper for me to make 2 marks?!  Fair enough, I followed the sushi ordering rules.   I went with one specialty roll and then a standard spicy tuna.    The place was pretty full, yes, but I watched several other tables that showed up after me get their stuff before I did.  I know sushi can take longer but they had sushi too.  Plus, I was flying solo.  Anyway, the sushi arrived and it was about like everything else to this point, meh.  Lots of white rice on the outside, not a ton of stuff on the inside, and not a lot of taste.  It was pretty inexpensive and, as they say, you get what you pay for.  The whole lunch took about 45 minutes which is pretty long considering that I was by myself.   Maybe the sushi isn't their specialty, I don't know.  There are also some other Japanese-ish dishes, hibachi and such. Based upon my overall experience, I was pretty underwhelmed.",

Their wasabi is more powerful than most places and my head feels as though it will explode if I'm not careful. I kind of like it though.   The salmon was tasty and I like their carrots.   The only issue is that they will not hold the mushrooms. The waitresses say that it's all cooked together (with the other vegetables such as sweet carrots and broccoli).  So?  Doesn't a lot of places buy mixed bags of veggies? Have the cook remove the mushrooms anyway. It's not hard to do. I've seen hibachi cooks do this with my very eyes. I mean, if I can remove them from the entree after they've been cooked, why can they just not removed at square one?  I've asked on three separate occasions and they will not do it and you have eat your food after picking the mushrooms out, making a tiny little fort of dirt fungus around the edges of your plate. You stuff the rest of the food in your mouth knowing that they were infused together while cooking on the grill with dirt wart residue, no doubt fertilized by the decomposed remains of chipmunks or beetles, making the food taste like three stars instead of 4 or 5.   Fix your mushroom situation! Update 8/18/17. I tried this place again after all this time and they still won't remove mushrooms at the onset. That's so stupid.",

Terrible service and terrible food.  I got the shrimp entree with mixed vegetables of broccoli, mushroom, onion, zucchini and sweet carrot. Absolutely terrible.  I have never had overcooked stir fry before, it was mushy and disgusting.   Shumai dumplings were the worst I've ever had.  My friend had a similiar meal, I think with chicken.  The 3rd party had sushi that she didn't really eat so I'm not sure what the verdict was on that.  On top of the terrible food, it was over priced so we paid $23 each for food that sucked and regretted wasting our per diem there.",

The vegetables had a burnt taste like the grill hadn't been cleaned and the salmon was horribly over cooked and dry. The shrimp was descent but salty. My wife's plate came out with shrimp and salmon instead of the shrimp and chicken she ordered. They made her chicken and said it was ok at best. I will never eat here again and I would advise anyone else to be very wary as well.

Promptly greeted and seated... the dining room has a lot of tables and booths in the perimeter.  We didn't go at 'peak' hours, but it was nice to have a quiet dining space and attentive service, but something tells me they can move people in and out of here pretty quickly.   I was craving sushi that evening and went that route, but my friend ordered a meal (salad and drink).  Pretty impressed that the sushi didn't take that long to come out along with my friend's entree.  One pound of wasabi and a lot of soy sauce later... I was a happy camper.  I ordered the Sumo Roll, Spicy Tuna, and a Salmon roll... yeah I was a little greedy that night.

Would have been a minor mistake, but I verified MULTIPLE times on the phone Philly roll, not Cali Roll. Even went as far as to say, Philadelphia Roll. Whatever, we'll live. However, the rolls had plastic wrap wrapped in them. Not one, not two, but multiple pieces of plastic inside of the roll. Will never return, which is unfortunate because they're so close to my home.",

    "text": "Long story short:  I just got royally ripped off with not one but two bait/switches.  Backstory:  Mai used to be on Colony Road and was owned by Japanese folks.  It was one of the few Charlotte Japanese restaurants actually owned/operated by Japanese.  You could go there and actually speak Japanese to some of the waitstaff and sushi chefs.  Mai bought the Ayrsley location from some non-Japanese folks who served pretty bad Japanese food.  When Mai took over, the sashimi quality obviously improved, but most if not all of the waitstaff had no clue as to anything remotely related to Japanese food.  Then, the bait/switch began.  Mai has maintained the same wine menu for at least four or so years, but if you try to order the \"house\" wine, the waitstaff will tell you that they are \"all out.\"   So, for the last four or so years, Mai has only stocked their most expensive wines and has not restocked the house wines.  Really?  I have put up with this rip off because the location is very, very convenient when I need a sushi fix.  If I have to pay a few bucks extra for a glass of wine, whatever.  But, this last visit sent me over the edge.  On the little sushi order sheet, I clearly marked that I wanted a piece of salmon nigiri.  I was served a very cheap cut of white fish which I ate without complaint due to time constraints.  But, I was actually charged for the salmon which was about $2 more than the trash fish I ate.  I was in such a hurry that I just paid and left.  However, when I return, and I will return due to its location and my sushi cravings, I will NEVER let them rip me off again.  Time to be vigilant with these con-artists.       PS:  The place is packed during lunch, folks seem to love their hibachi, and their tempura is awful.",

Service was friendly and fast.  I went around 7pm. And I like that they give you an option for a 6oz protein portion vs a 9oz portion even during dinner hours. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because their windows weren't clean...outside and inside. But the restaurant was clean and the food was really good so I would definitely come again!",

The take out consisted of shrimp fried rice and three rolls. She misheard one of the rolls so we ended up with a veggie roll instead of spicy salmon. She offered to make it for me but the sushi bar looked to be cleaned up so I passed on that offer and was charged about five dollars for the veggie roll that had avocado, cucumber, lettuce and carrots (probably could have made three at home for that price). The food was packed up nicely, sushi rolls with fish were decent for the price. Fried rice was disappointing, won't be ordering that again.  Not bad as a neighborhood sushi fix, will be back.",

I came with a co-worker during prime lunchtime and they were about 70%  empty, which in hindsight should have been a sign.     Our drink order was taken immediately and overall the service was good, hence the 2 stars.   I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the 6oz hibachi entree  as a combo with the addition of salad, soup and fried rice.  The best part of the meal was the soup and the yum yum sauce....yes you read that right.   In a nutshell: the chicken was lacking flavor, hard, and dry, the salad was drowned in the ginger dressing, the veggies were overcooked and the sushi was just a mushy mess.  The carrots in the mixed veggies seemed to be honey glazed carrots that were added to the other veggies at the last minute.    I won't be back unfortunately.",

    "text": "Wow. So I've given Mai a chance, thinking I had visited on a bad day or something, but I've faced the last straw and it's time I give my review. I don't think I will ever be back. I don't understand how it has a 3-star rating.  The service was awful. Just awful. The waitresses scarcely visit and seem completely disconnected from their patrons. No kindness, maybe ONE smile, no sincerity or concern.  The soups and salads came out fast. The soup as adequate. The salad was drowning in ginger sauce. I could barely get through it.  My friends ordered hibachi, which only took about 10 minutes to arrive. They said it was okay, just your run-of-the-mill hibachi food. It was probably the only vaguely positive thing about our experience.  I ordered sushi, which I got 20 MINUTES LATER with no apology and a further mix-up, after my coworkers were almost completely done with their food. It was a roll with spicy tuna inside and tempura on the outside. I should've taken a picture - when it arrived at my table, it was literally buried beneath a HUGE pile of tempura. I think there was sushi in there somewhere, but it was also awful. I'm now hoping that won't get food poisoning from the old, disgusting fish that was inside. I couldn't finish it, even in my ravenous hunger. My friends also had ordered rolls, both of which were disappointing as well. An eel roll was about 10% eel and 90% cucumber. I've never seen such ridiculous, sloppy sushi in my life. The grocery store would have been better.  There was a couple next to us who had been there even before we arrived, and one of them NEVER received her food the entire time we were there. She had to ask for it in a to-go box after waiting 30+ minutes, and even then, she waited another 15 minutes for the check.  Speaking of checks - the waitress had clarified that we were splitting it at the very beginning. There were only 3 of us, and we weren't sharing any food. And yet, in the end, we got 2. The one that had been combined was missing an item completely. It took us another 10 minutes to sort out the payment process.  There was no politeness or kindness offered, even though we didn't show any of the anger we were feeling. Instead, just cold, careless interactions that left us with a horrible taste in our mouth - literally as well as figuratively.  I'm not giving my money to this restaurant again. The experience pretty much wrecked the entire day, and I hope it doesn't wreck my stomach tonight.",

The food here was pretty good and being a big eater I was especially happy with the amount of fish given which was 9 ounces. 9 ounces of fish and the menu price was $13 which was I dare say unbeatable for the quantity. We also had a coupon for this place which gave us $10 off the bill, putting two meals after tax and tip at $22. The fish itself was pretty good, nothing too good or too bad. The only problem I had while here was the problem with our orders. Being healthy eaters we generally have special edits to our meals such as no extra sauce or soaked in butter. When our meal was delivered we had a couple of errors with that and one of the sides was wrong, but they were quick to fix it so it wasn't a big problem. Would probably come here again given the good portion sizes.",

That being said the service is mediocre just thought it was weird that I order Hibachi and only bring out Shrimp Sauce until I had to ask for the Ginger Sauce which was cold because it was in the refrigerator.

It was appropriately decorated, but the seats at the booth had some tears which made me slightly uncomfortable to sit at and the table top wasn't fully cleaned. I think this place is a good spot to get lunch if you're in the area and are craving sushi; the menu has plenty of options to choose from and the pricing of the sushi is reasonable in my opinion.

They may not have the variety that some other sushi places have, but the rolls they go make are solid.  Their sushi rice is flavorful every time as well, so it really complements their nigiri and rolls.  I've occasionally had issues with the tuna being less fresh than the other fish, but that seems to be a problem at several other sushi places here in Charlotte.  I also really like their ginger dressing that comes on the salad - I think it's tastier than a lot of other restaurant's dressing.  I always get carry-out here, so I can't speak to the service.  However, each time I've been in the restaurant was clean and the employees were nice. The prices are a little higher than some other restaurants in the area, but I think the quality of food is much higher and is worth the price.  Once of these days I will definitely have to dine in instead of getting carry-out.",

Timely and got exactly what I asked for. No delays. The beer was cold and they serve the large beers.   The appetizers were ok. Did not care for the fried vegetables, to much batter on them.    The sushi was off the hook. Everything tasted yummy and fresh. The style and presentation of the sushi was pretty unique for each selection of sushi.   Enjoy.",

I ordered: Salmon avocado Tuna avocado  Kelli roll- specialty roll Arizona roll- spicy tuna and avocado  The sushi was very fresh, tasted great! The service was quick, restaurant was clean! They make the sushi right in front and that makes it a very transparent experience, which is crucial for a sushi restaurant!  Overall great and would recommend!",

    "text": "Food: Inconsistent. Mediocre overall. The only element that was above average was the shrimp, but I found pretty much everything else lacking. The fried rice was the worst I have had in a while - way overcooked, seasoning was off, almost like it was too heavy on black pepper, and the peas were unashamedly shriveled and tough. The jiaozi were OK.  Service: Perhaps the best part of the experience. Server was very reserved, but attentive, and refilled our drinks several times.   Price: A bit overpriced I think. I do not believe a 6oz portion of this quality is worth over $10.  Atmosphere: Clean and comfortable interior, though the windows did not look clean from the outside. We were expecting the hibachi experience, but there were no grills in the dining area. Generic \"Now That's What I Call Music\" pop songs playing in the background got annoying after a while.  This place has a few good points, and some potential, but it is mediocre overall, which means it is unmemorable and not praiseworthy.",

Like it's on the edge of being spoiled or rotten. Won't be coming back. Service was fast. Tempura was oily. Hibachi was ok but not done properly. Fried rice was terrible and tasted sour. I would avoid this place and let it go out of business. It's just not all that good. You have been warned.",

I called in and ordered the 9oz hibachi shrimp but I only wanted onions and zucchini instead of the plethora of vegetables they serve you(listed on the menu),  at first the guy on the phone said ok. I then order the ayrsley roll but instead of cucumber I wanted avocado. I didn't think my order was too complicated but when there is a language barrier I guess it was. he repeated my order back to my incorrectly so I corrected him and he just put someone else on the phone and they told me I would have to get to the mix vegetables they can't seperate it out. (I hate mushrooms) I just said ok and was told my food would be ready in 20. When I got there, it was ready. Food was descent, rice was a little mushy (not sticky) like it been in a steamer all day but edible. the shrimp were good and nice sized. The sushi was the best. I would go back only when I feel like picking the mushrooms out of my veggies. I'll be back for sushi before I come back for hibachi.",
