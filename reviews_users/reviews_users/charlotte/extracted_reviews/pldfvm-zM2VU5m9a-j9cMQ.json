The pesto Capri had the right amount of veggies and then tartness of the goat cheese really made a difference. But the best part was the creme de la creme which was a strawberry and Nutella crepe that took me right back to Paris! The crepes were light and fluffy with a touch of crispness on the outside! Absolutely delicious",

    "text": "This place makes a solid crepe - ranging from sweet and savory to (relatively) healthy to seriously indulgent (hello maple bacon egg and cheese crepe). But CAREFUL: there are two locations! My sister and I made this mistake and ended up in the corporate cafe inside of a deserted glassy lobby on the weekend (200 S Tryon). It was yummy, but the meal experience itself had no soul.  The OTHER location in the 7th Street Market is what some other reviewers have posted photos of and it's a totally different experience: situated in a bustling food hall with more food gawking and devouring to be had. If you just want a crepe with no fuss, perhaps the first location is for you. Otherwise, check out their other spot. There's so much more fun to be had, and its just a few blocks away. Wish we had only known!",

I personally love dessert crepes, but tried the breakfast crepe and the chipotle chicken crepe. both crepes were amazing! the crepes had just the right amount of crisp on the outside and softer towards the enter. All the lettuces, tomatoes and avocados tasted super fresh and light. The sauce they used were also very delicious and went well with the rest of the crepe. the portion looked pretty big, but even after finishing it I didn't feel overly stuff and was very satisfied. The place is pretty spacious and can seat small groups of people, but probably not a huge party. The place is also very clean and modern which i loved. I need to come back to try their sweet dessert crepes!",

    "text": "I was looking for a new place to grab a quick lunch with a friend in Uptown and decided on Hazelnuts Creperie for something a little more out of the box than the usual sandwich and chips. I'd seen their sign on Tryon Street a few times, which was the only way I knew this hidden spot existed, so I put on my metaphorical beret, hopped aboard my bicycle and pedaled over to Hazlenuts for a Parisian-inspired lunch date.   The place is small, but a good amount of seating is available in the lobby area of the office building where it's located. The menu isn't incredibly extensive, but they do have both savory and sweet options and a \"create your own\" choice that leaves it pretty much up to your imagination with a combination of meats, cheeses, toppings and sauces. My friend and I went the savory route - she created her own chicken and ranch crepe and I ordered the pesto chicken crepe. Both were $7, a good size, pretty tasty and ready in a flash. We would have gladly stuffed our faces with a dessert crepe smothered in Nutella, but alas, willpower won out and we resisted the temptation.   They had a little trouble ringing up my friend's \"create your own\" option at first, but the manager came by to check on us later and offered to sign us up for the free loyalty card, so the effort was definitely appreciated. Overall, Hazelnuts is a great option for a quick and tasty lunch.",

Typically on a menu there are a few items that stick out, everything sounds delicious here! The Mariachi, Maple Dream, and Basil Pesto Chicken are all fantastic.   3. They also do breakfast all day which I love. Pricing is pretty standard, although the canned drinks etc are all VERY reasonable ( less than $1)  Highly recommended!",

The music is soothing, all sorts of people coming in and out.  You can see the staff make your breakfast.  Super cool to see everything made in front of you.  I got the Americana crepe.  It was probably one of the best crepes I've had.  Light and fluffy at the same time, I can't really explain it.  You'll just need to try it to understand it.  The inside is very nice, I see several people chatting, reading a book or like myself on a laptop.  People aren't overly loud and aware of the surroundings.  Super plus!  Good place for breakfast and food is mighty tasty.  If you're in the mood for crepes,I would recommend Hazelnuts without a doubt.",

    "text": "EXCITED ABOUT EATING BY ERNIE HIERS   This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" has me stepping out of my comfort zone as we visited Hazelnuts Creperie. Now, I wouldn't consider myself a crepe-type guy. I tend to steer toward BBQ and chicken wings, but I am willing to try anything once. If you have never had a crepe, it is a very thin pancake, usually made from wheat or buckwheat flour and is cooked on a crepe griddle. Their consumption is widespread in France.   Hazelnuts Creperie is tucked inside the lobby of a skyscraper in downtown Charlotte. Their menu offers a variety of sweet, savory, and vegetarian options. I chose a breakfast crepe, \"The Mariachi\", which incorporates scrambled eggs, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, red onions, avocados, and Jalapeno cream inside of a perfectly cooked crepe. My wife also chose a breakfast crepe, the \"Chevre & Mozz\", which integrates scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms, olives, red onions, and goat and mozzarella cheese.   As for my first crepe ever, \"The Mariachi\" was surprisingly good. I can truly tell you that I was not expecting the depth of flavor that melded together. If fact, I have never really liked avocados, but mixed with the Jalapeno cream, the taste was exceptional with just the right amount of kick. My wife's \"Chevre & Mozz\" also had very deep flavors. For the most part, I do not like mushrooms or olives, but this combination was outstanding, and the goat cheese definitely was the star of the show.  For dessert we shared \"The Chunkster\" which consists of peanut butter, bananas, chocolate chips, trail mix and maple syrup. As a peanut butter lover, this crepe was a little on the sweet side. My wife, not being a peanut butter lover, felt that the peanut butter overwhelmed the crepe and for the most part, it tasted like a warm pb&j minus the jelly. Not one she would try again.  Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for the crepe connoisseur or for anyone that has never tried a crepe. I would rate this establishment 4 spoons out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  The restaurant was reviewed by Food Blogger Ernie Hiers in his series \"Excited about Eating\".

I'd love to go back and try one of their sweet crepes, since they were a big hit with the rest of our party! Their coffee is locally roasted and tastes like heaven.

Note that this place is not visible from the road, it's tucked into the building lobby so it's hidden a bit. Look for the sandwich board sign they place in front of the building.    You order and pay at the front. Takes a little time as they make your crepe fresh of course. They recently implemented a pager system instead of yelling out your name. Bravo!  The seating is a little less than satisfying as there are a few tables in the building lobby here.   Honestly go for the food, it's delic",

It's not really a restaurant, but designed for ordering at the counter and ideally taking it to go. If you are lucky, you'll find a spot at a table lining the hallway and lobby area. On a busy day, plan a good 15-25 minute wait from standing in line to getting your crepe.  They have a good variety to please anyone: sweet or savory. I ordered a vegetarian crepe and it was just the right amount, flavor and size, for a quick lunch stop before heading over to the Belk Theater to catch a show.",

The chipotle chicken was so good we had to order a second one. The crepes are a good size and I truly appreciated the crepe to filling ratio. I've gone to some high end creperies and the balance was extremely mediocre. It's nice to see that this little shop inside of a hotel/residency has got their act together versus some long time stand alone places! Hopefully Hazelnut will expand in the future. I could see this chain in a lot of places if it isn't already!",

We ordered a banana spit crepe. One would think there is no way you can spoil it- just add bananas, ice cream and Nutella- and you have a happy customer. Well.. the trick is to serve all of that on a freshly-made, hot crepe, not a pre-made cold and crusty on the sides..  Big disappointment.",

It was perfectly loaded with delicious goat cheese, finely diced red onion, fresh red tomatoes, chicken, pesto sauce and I can't remember the green component (I was too busy discreetly scarfing it down)!?! The crepe was not too thin and not too thick, literally just right with a slight crisp texture. The crispness was excellent, it defied any possible sogginess from the juicy interior of scrumptious ingredients.  You order at the counter, service was very friendly and mannerly. This was a super satisfying lunch and I  look forward to trying more of the savory crepes as well as the sweet crepes.",

As for the food,  the offer a wide selection of breakfast crepes,  but also offer lunch crepes, including a good selection of vegetarian dishes and fresh salads.   For my breakfast I ordered the maple dream, and they were not lying, it was dreamy.   Plenty of bacon and cheddar melted and gently folded in a light crepe that's then topped with maple syrup and a dash of powdered sugar.   Recommend this one for a first timer but I will be branching out next time to the \"Swiss & Delish\".",

There are a lot of selection for crepes, this place is literally ALL about crepes. We ordered both a sweet and salty crepe and they were delicious. I can tell a lot of thought process is put into the creation of the crepes and I really appreciate that. Only two problems, this place is kind of tucked inside a business building on the first floor and second, parking is hard to deal with, if you do not work uptown you will need to drive here and park at one of the paid parking garages. This place is also only a breakfast lunch place and is not open on Sundays. There is only one other crepe place in Charlotte that comes close and it is the crepe cellar, but still, the crepes at crepe cellar are way too sweet with too much nutella, this place is very hearty and is truly one of the VERY best crepes I've ever had, I am trying to come back ASAP!",

The service was great too.  My only gripe is that they can't fry up eggs separate from the crepe, but this is because of the type of space they have in the tower, not their fault.  So, if you're into crepes, this is probably a great place with a wide variety of crepe options and combinations.",

I chose it specifically because I cannot eat gluten and was so pleasantly surprised that Charlotte had a gluten-free creperie. On their menu online, it says the offer gluten-free crepes. My whole flight I was looking forward to it. I found parking two blocks away, walked those two blocks, entered the store, only to find out they don't serve gluten-free crepes at the location I went to. There was no mention of this on the website. So,  not only did I pay for parking, not get breakfast because now I'm late for my meeting, but I'm not going to get the crepes I do looked forward to. Poor business to mislead customers and cause them to have their day thrown off because of negligence to put correct info on the website.",

For whatever reason, this slowed the chefs down getting all of the crepes made.  We were on our way to catch a flight and were in a rush. Of course, a refund was out of the question since their computers were not working. We waited a whopping 20 minutes. They were so backed up but the chefs literally went into slow motion the entire time and we watched in awe as they continued to several people in line after us get their meals. When we went back to the counter to inquire, they just seemed annoyed instead of being apologetic. When we asked to get ours to go b/c we had been waiting so long, it also seemed like they were annoyed although we tried being as patient as possible.",

It's not like I'm going to sit there and rip apart my crepe while standing up at the takeout counter to make sure everything is not rancid - that's the restaurant's duty.    I had one experience that was OK - then today I went back and ordered the Catalina, only to return to my office 20 minutes later to find rotten, disgusting avocado throughout the dish.  I'm not talking slightly browned due to oxidation - I mean black.  More black than green.  I would say the avocados were 80% black or brown with a slight tint of brownish green.  I've uploaded photos, check them out if you doubt me.  The problem is, I don't have time to walk back down there and get something else to eat, so I sit through my entire day with no food thanks to this place.    The icing on the cake:  when I called to ask for a refund, I was given attitude by the manager.  Ultimately he apologized, telling me he thought I was a \"cold call.\"  Nope.  Just a hungry ex-customer who was served rotten food.  The only reason this gets 2 stars is because my prior experience was mediocre (3-star), so I split the difference.  I would NOT recommend this place based on poor quality control (what else are they serving people that is rotten?  I highly doubt this was the first time something like this has happened) and poor customer service.  Those are the two things a restaurant must stand behind - it's food and its employees.  This place has neither.  Go somewhere else.",

We went the wrong way and landed on North Tryon.  You want South Tryon.  This fresh crepe goodness is in an office building next to McCormick & Schmicks.  We finally found it on a recent Monday morning, and had the place to ourselves.  It is a small counter-service place.  Order, pay, and the gal who made our crepes did bring them to us.  My Americana was giant!  Filled with turkey, scrambled egg, avocado, onion, tomato, spinach and chipotle aioli tied it all together nicely.  Way too big for me, and since we were traveling I sadly had to waste some of it.  But Husband had no problem wolfing down an entire Chevre & Mozz, which had scrambled egg, bacon, mushrooms, onion, olives, goat cheese & mozzarella.    Loved the variety on the menu of sweet & savory crepes, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity.  ($8.50 for mine and $8.25 for Husband's).  Oddly enough neither of us had cell phone signals in here, so if you have to dink around on your phone while eating, it could possibly be a problem.",

As it turns out, there is a sandwich board outside directing you in so it's not that difficult to find.   Whether you want breakfast, lunch, or an afternoon snack, they have a variety of crepes to suit just about everyone. My husband had the Maple Dream, and I tried the Americana. Both were big, but the Americana is stuffed with more ingredients that all blend together so well - with the chipotle aioli adding such a great flavor. No need for side items unless you have a huge appetite. The crepe will cover it!  We live in downtown Greenville, SC and an establishment such as this would do well here, especially if it stayed open later for the dessert crowd.",

So I went on my trusty Yelp app. & found this place with high reviews and within walking distance of our hotel. The four of us got different crepes, maple dream for most of us, a build your own for my daughter and then we got a sweet one (including fresh fruit and Nutella to share!) oh my! these crepes were absolutely delicious!!! The Mape Dream: A combination of crispy bacon, eggs,melted cheddar in a perfectly warm delicious crepe, covered with maple syrup,a pat of real butter and lightly dusted with confectioners' sugar...was enough to make you..well  go back the next morning for more!!! And that is exactly what we did!!My daughters crepe was equally delicious. She had bacon, eggs, mozzarella, fresh spinach & sweet red onions. The Sweet Crepe we got had sliced bananas, fresh strawberries, Nutella and fresh whipped  cream and powdered sugar on top!!! What is not to like about this! This place is actually in the first floor of an office building (look for the sign out side) and yes you can sit down and eat your crepes there, or do as we did and got it \"to go\"and went and found a nice outdoor spot to enjoy the warm sun. Another thing about this place was the young people that worked behind the counter (taking the orders and making the crepes) they had to have been some of the nicest people we met in Charlotte!  We are definitely heading to hazelnuts creperie next time we go to Charlotte!!!",

Aside from the sweet and a savory varieties, it still lacks originality and freshness.  A \"Charlotte\" variety would kick it up a notch.

This is a simple place, with two large tables inside their space, and a few more two- and four-seaters in the building.  The food is surprisingly good and it's worth giving them a try.  I prefer them for breakfast, and my favorite is the make-your-own crepe with scrambled eggs, ham, cheddar, avocado, and chipotle aioli. They do scrambled eggs nicely by spreading the egg around the crepe so it bakes right in.  They are also generous with the fillings. The aioli is a really good call, as it adds both flavor and a little heat. If you add avocado, they give you half of one scooped fresh right out of the shell.  I LOVE this crepe.  When my hubby joined me on one visit, he tried the mariachi crepe, with scrambled eggs, cheddar, bacon, black beans, and red onions.  I liked everything but the sauce - it was too creamy and there was a little too much of it.   Their coffee is strong enough for our taste and is pretty good.  Refills are $1.  For lunch, I have tried the make your own crepe with avocado, spinach, black beans, cheddar, and jalapeno cream.  You don't even miss the meat with this one!  The jalapeno cream also adds great flavor without being too spicy.  I have yet to try their sweet crepes; I always have a craving for savory when I visit.  Eventually I will.  I really enjoy their food and plan to keep returning!",

Let me just say, if you're not good at finding parking on the side of the road in uptown, be ready to pay for parking. Luckily after driving around the area for about 10mins we got lucky and found free parking on the side of the road.  When we got there we were a little surprise that it was located inside the lobby of a building. but that didn't stop us from eating there. They were pretty busy, but there was a great atmosphere. This is not a restaurant where you will get served. You will have to order and wait for them to call your number. Honestly, if they had an actual restaurant this place would be twice as busy! Now for the best part of my experience! The employees at Hazelnuts Creperie on S. Tryon were absolutely welcoming! I wish we would have gotten the name of the lady at the register. She was so nice and greeted us with a big warm smile even though it had been so busy. We asked her a few questions and she suggested that I get the Chipotle chicken crepe because it was one of her favorites! My girlfriend asked about the Mariachi breakfast crepe and the lady mentioned that it was another favorite. Boy was she right, they were both super delicious! The chipotle chicken crepe is like a salad inside of a crepe. Fresh lettuce and most importantly fresh chicken. The Mariachi, had a little spice to it but nothing too overbearing. It was very cheesy and it has just the right amount of sour cream & guacamole. Overall, all the other girls who were working the time we came worked so well together and really got the crepes out at a decent time.",

    "text": "A very solid breakfast/lunch option, especially if you're looking to try a crepe in Charlotte. I ordered the Southwestern veggie, which has cheddar, black beans, tomatoes, red onion, garlic chilies, avocado, and sour cream (I left off sour cream). The crepe was thin and crispy but still held up well under the toppings. This crepe didn't have a ton of fillings but it was loaded with cheese which was good because who doesn't love cheese? I wish they would cook the fillings separately, however, because the cheese was melted enough but the avocado and black beans were pretty firm and would've been better if they'd been cooked just a little before being placed on the crepe. The tomatoes and red onion added good flavor, and the garlic chilies added a nice kick and flavor for a few bites but were missed for the most part.  My crepe came out in 6-7 minutes just before the lunch rush wave, which seemed pretty quick to me. For $8-9 for a crepe that isn't super filling, it's not the best deal, but the ingredients seemed very fresh and high quality so it's certainly not a ripoff either.",

Also good to note that it's kind of like a little cafe as opposed to a sit down restaurant with a waiter. You just order up front and take a seat, nothing super fancy. They are a bit expensive (around $9 each) but I guess since they are good sized crepes it's worth it. Enjoy!",

In my head, I know that a lunch crepe would be a good lunch. But then the stomach gets involved and I feel wary that I'll still be hungry when the meal is over.  The good news is that I loved it. Enough food to be satisfied but not enough to bring on the post-food coma.  I have tried a buffalo chicken crepe and a curry crepe.  The curry one was easily the best of the two, but both were very good. Watch out for the lunch rush, seating is pretty limited here.",

I am so fortunate to work across the street from their Tryon location, but the great news is that in the two years between my reviews, they've opened up a 2nd location in the 7th Street Public Market.  I'm not sure which location sees more people, but the more locations, the better when you are talking about Hazelnuts.  The staff always warmly greets me by my first name in the mornings and I have a \"regular\" order now.  It may be pretty quiet in the mornings here, but the staff are on their toes prepping for a big lunch service.  I've never been here for lunch, but the way they are prepping during breakfast time, there must be a large crowd.  My \"go-to\" regular order in the mornings is a Mariachi with no onions and it hits the spot every morning.  Probably my second favorite order for breakfast is the Maple Dream.  You can't really go wrong with anything from the menu... or create your own!  So I used to think that being located in the building lobby would be a disadvantage.  But since the restaurant space itself only has two 4 person tables within it makes sense for the tables to over flow into the lobby area.  The tables that can be pushed together for large groups.  My favorite thing to do during breakfast is to eat my Mariachi and people watch the folks walking through the lobby.",

Plenty of vegetarian options too.  Once you place your order at the counter, you get a buzzer to indicate when your food is done.  My friend and I both ordered crepes, it took about 5 minutes from the time we placed the order until it was ready.

The crepe has Smoked Turkey, Mozzarella, Avocado, Bacon, Romaine, Tomato and Chipotle aioli. In some ways I was semi hesitant, thinking won't the lettuce be soggy?  Nope. Very delicious combo of ingredients.  I've since become addicted and now add red onions to the mix.   Evidence of the addiction happened just this week as I walked down Tryon St with one lunch destination in mind but never made it past Hazelnuts. I'm sure all the other crepes are yummy too but I may never find out!",

I took him up on it, and enjoyed a flavorful chevre & mozzarella crepe *with* a smooth, bold locally-roasted coffee.    Unfortunately, the staff informed me, the creperie won't be open for other DNC travellers to try next week... because of the tight restrictions on traffic & parking in the area, the restaurant won't be able to get supplies in the morning.  Bummer, because it was worth the trip (twice).  ---------------------------------- Late flight into Charlotte for DNC... Placed crepe order + coffee @ 12:04 pm.  \"We're out of coffee\". Could you make more, I ask?  The answer was no.  Sorry, local business I specifically drove  to in order to support you... I had to go to Dean & Deluca across the street.   Note for Charlotte business owners: thousands of journalists & politicos are about to descend upon you.  If you want them to give you their $$, extend those coffee serving hours past Noon.",

    "text": "Just follow the smell of butter.  And don't let the name lead you to believe this is a dessert-only joint. Savory crepes play a starring role, too, which is what led a friend and me here for lunch.   The small, clean, white/natural space is set up for counter service, with a couple four-tops inside and several smaller two-tops just outside the creperie. An assortment of bottled and canned non-alcoholic drinks are on display next to the counter. Eat-in or to-go, you'll take a number and enjoy a relatively short wait (~five minutes) before the goodness arrives.  I had the Southwest veggie, which was like a rice-less burrito in terms of fillings. Black beans, tomato, fresh avocado (not the processed mush, thank you kindly), cheddar and the right amount of sour cream. Fluffy with just a little crisp around the edges, my crepe was a tasty and filling bite.   There are more than a half-dozen carnivore-friendly selections, as well as the option to add meat to a veggie crepe. Breakfast is on the menu, whether you crave a signature or custom crepe, and should you desire an afternoon sugar coma you've come to the right place. They had me at Nutella...  I'll be back to indulge in a dessert crepe and hope business one day allows Saturday morning hours--weekends are for breaking the weekday cereal routine, and some days my motivation goes only far as Bisquick.",

But as soon as you enter the building, you are immediately struck by the buttery scent of crepes! What makes this unusual, at least for THIS area, is that they specialize in SAVORY crepes. The first crepe I had here, for lunch, was their lunch special chicken curry (sweeter version of curry, not madras or hot style), with mango chutney added. Combined with that delicious crepe batter, it was HEAVENLY! Because the shop was so new, the owner, a nice fellow named \"Asi,\" offered us a free dessert crepe, complete with goat cheese, walnuts, fresh strawberries and drizzled with honey. Oh was that ever good!  Just today, went back to try their breakfast crepes. I'm SO glad I did, as I customized it by adding a scrambled egg, brie cheese, ham and bacon. Anything with Brie just is killer, so this crepe was killer! So flavorful, and a very nice sized one too.  Price wise, they are very reasonable, and certainly worth every penny! This is SO what Charlotte needed. Go check it out, and tell Asi that Paul sent you! (I promised I'd spread the word).",

Even though there's only two tables in the creperie, there's a whole bunch of tables and chairs nearby so they can accommodate for large groups too. Whether you're craving a savory or dessert crepe, all of their choices are solid. I went with the curry chicken crepe for breakfast, and I loved it. (Their other most popular choice is the Maple Dream.) Either way, I don't think it's possible to go wrong with any of their large, filling crepes for $7-8!",

It is not a waitress and sit down place. You put your order in, they call your number and you go get it and sit down where you find room. The food is served in paper plates and disposable silverware. However it is delicious and worth trying.  I had the banana & nutella crepe and my husband some spicy egg crepe and we both loved it. The coffee is good and they have other beverages too. The menu is quite extensive and they make the crepes right there in front of you so they don't sit under a heat lamp.   The price is amazing too. If I worked uptown Charlotte I would eat here frequently.",

More of a kiosk feel; paper plates, plastic utensils, but delicious crapes. No booths for proper seating just tables and chairs in the lobby area, still felt fine. Delicious choices, make your own, they don't scrimp on fillings. Quick service even during a rush.",

I so wanted to try one of the dessert crepes but the generous portion of my savory one left me stuffed. I recommend going with a friend and splitting one of each!",

My friend and I were debating over which to get, and one employee (I wish I knew his name, but he's a big black guy -- he's awesome!) was helping us out. I ended up picking the Maple Dream. When my friend and I were deciding what to get, I mentioned to her that I loved bacon. The guy who made my crepe mentioned that he added extra bacon to my crepe!!! He also asked if I wanted cinnamon on my crepe!  The crepe was SOOOO GOOD! It was sweet and salty. The crepe itself was very soft, and the fillings were  very flavorful. 10/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "Excellent little nook located just inside the building lobby. This is a great place to grab a quick & delicious bite. Ayonna & Tashia (I really hope I spelled their names correctly) were amazingly pleasant & accommodating. Usually I like a sweet crepe but today I was in the mood for something savory so I opted for The Santorini (86 the olives, add chicken, sub egg whites) because that's how I roll. Ayonna aimed to please and made the perfect version just for me. Needless to say I devoured Santorini, wishing I could go back for seconds.   The setup is similar to Subway...you can view all the toppings opposite side of the glass as the crepe is being built. There are plenty of beverages and chips should you desire. Hazelnuts is a staple when in Charlotte. The bookmark stays in place.  ~Christy",

It was really good. Then we got the Creame de creame Crepe, which is strawberries and Nutella and they didn't put enough Nutella as they should have. Our friends got a Mariachi Crepe and a Banana and Berry crepe, they liked the crepes but not enough Nutella. This place was very hidden and wasn't super clean, we had to clean after the people who were in our table. Therefore, I am going giving them 4 starts.",

The place is a bit of a hidden gem as it is tucked away in a lobby of a building. A lady had to let us in since the door is locked on the weekends.  We checked out the menu which has a great selection of savory and sweet crepes. I ordered the maple dream - a breakfast crepe full of eggs, bacon, cheddar, maple syrup. It was amazing! It let so satisfied as I got sweet and savory bites for breakfast. The fiance got the creme de la crepe - a dessert crepe of strawberries and nutella. It was good as well, but too sweet for me at breakfast time.   I got to witness some excellent customer service while we ate. A guy was waiting for his order and the place realized they shorted him an order. He didn't make it a big deal, but the lady working made sure it was the next one completed as well as gave them another sweet crepe of their choice for no charge.  Great food and great service for a not so obvious place to eat.",

So glad we found this on Yelp! Contrary to other reviewers I did not find this place hard to find.. they have a very obvious store front.  The menu is extensive -- I truly believe there's something for everyone! Vegetarians, healthy options, meatier options, sweet tooth options and everything in between.   I ordered the Catalina Crepe which had chicken, swiss cheese, mushroom red onion avocado and jalapeno cream. They give you ar estaurant buzzer while you wait so you know when your crepes are ready. From pay to order took probably 5-7 minutes at the most.  My partner ordered the Santorini which was egg, feta cheese, kalamata olives, mushroom spinach and red onions. Both were so delicious, and so filling!   The ingredients work very well together, my avocado was nice and fresh and I loved the jalapeno cream. The swiss cheese with mushrooms also worked so well. I'll be craving these back in Philly, that's for sure! Definitely recommended.",

Both the chipotle chicken and southwest veggie were similar with the veggie having beans instead of chicken. The chipotle sauce was good and creamy. Also as a sauce lover, I asked for a side of whatever good sauce they had. They lady was nice enough to let me try all of them. The extra chipotle sauce for both the chicken and veggie crepes was a great extra. The jalapeno sauce was great also. Slightly spicy, barely noticeable but enough to know it's there. I also tried the curry sauce but was not a big fan. It might taste different with its own special ingredient crepe so will have to try that next time. The pumpkin crepe was amazing. It had enough pumpkin filling without it being too over powering.",

Located on lobby of a commercial complex on 200, South Tryon, which is just 2 blocks away from my condo. You should order & pay for the food at the counter upfront.  They serve lot's of varieties of crepes, both savories & sweet ones. Also you get to create your own crepes from the available fillings & toppings. I ordered The Maple dream, which has egg, cheddar &  bacon topped with butter, maple syrub & powdered sugar. Each & every bite was so yummy. It was sweet due to the maple syrup & powdered sugar. It was proper breakfast with right amount of proteins from eggs & bacon. Costs around $8 including tax for the crepe.  I would recommend this for all crepe lovers & those who look for good breakfast restaurants at Uptown, I will definitely visit here for good breakfast or brunch.",

Tucked away in the back of the lobby of a building, Hazelnuts Creperie offers a variety of both sweet and savory crepes for whatever craving you're looking to appease. I love a good savory crepe, but opted for The Lemon Drop crepe to shake things up a bit. My grandmother and I both ordered our crepes from the counter... and while service was decent enough, there wasn't anything especially friendly or welcoming about the service. You're almost wondering if you're bothering the staff by wanting to place an order.   After about 10 minutes, our crepes were ready (seems like a long time, but whatever). Unfortunately, mine seemed a bit under-cooked. And it's hard to under-cook a crepe because they're so thin... but something I want with my crepe are the cooked bits, where you can tell it was on the cooktop. They provide that wee bit of crunchiness, ya know? Just a tad of texture. Both my crepe and my grandmother's lacked that. Sad face. As far as taste for the crepes (I had mine, and also tasted the one my grandmother ordered), they were fine... but there's certainly nothing that stands out as tasty or quality (lemon zest in the Lemon Drop crepe would have really been awesome, for example). The crepes are very generic.  TL;DR  A bit of a \"blah\"-experience at Hazelnuts Creperie. Fine for a one-off visit, but I'm certainly not going to seek it out when back in Charlotte.",

They offer a wide variety of crepes both sweet and savory. On this day I was starving so I decided on something more filling and went with the Undo Your Thai Chicken crepe. I got my crepe togo but ended up eating the whole thing in the lobby table area.   The crepe was very filling. The flavors went well together but I'm not sure I would get the nuts and golden raisins again. The peanut sauce was very good. I do think the chunks of romaine need to be smaller. I had to use a knife and fork to eat the crepe.   They have some creative sweet combination I would like to give a try. Since they are only open in the am I have to make plans to come next time.

    "text": "Passed by and decided to stop in for lunch.  The restaurant is visible from the street, but tucked away inside the lobby of an office building.   I had hoped it would be a restaurant with waiter/waitress service, but it's not.  One orders and pays at the counter and then gets a gizmo that starts making noise when your food is ready.  It was a Saturday and the place was almost empty when I was there -- maybe one other table was full.  I was not in a hurry and had a book to read while I waited, but it still seemed to take quite a bit of time before my crepe was ready.  I would guess that the waits would be very long during lunch hour rush.  I ordered the savory Catalina Crepe and requested that they hold the jalopeno sauce.  Other ingredients were chicken, swiss cheese, mushrooms, red onions, and avocado.  The person I ordered from asked if I wanted to substitute sour cream for the jalopeno sauce and that seemed like a good idea to me so I agreed. My crepe was delicious.  Fresh, crispy at the edges, and very tasty.   I would have liked it better if the red onions had been sauteed, but even with crunchy uncooked onions, I enjoyed it.    Wheelchair accessibility notes:  Definitely accessible.  The building itself has automatic doors.  On entering, it looks at first as if one has to ascend two steps to get to the restaurant, but it turns out that a few steps further into the building, there is a nice easy ramp up to the restaurant.  The restaurant also has a really nice (customers-only) spacious wheelchair accessible bathroom with grab bars.",

The crepe is about the size of a large piece of pizza and packed with goodness of your choosing.  My choice was the smoked Blt which was really great, just could of used a something more to really throw it over the edge.  Didn't get a desert crepe so I will have to re visit and re evaluate but because I was pleasantly surprised with this place I give it 4 stars.",

    "text": "I'd like to second the notion that Hazelnuts has some of the best crepes in the QC and I'll even go a step further and say they have the best variety as well. There are few places in town to grab crepes and these guys do a fantastic job.   I had tried to visit a few times in the past but my plans were thwarted by either long lines or impossible parking situations. That should probably be your first plan of attack. Unless you're a briefcase-toting Uptowner or just so happen to find yourself at 200 S Tryon...by happenstance, then you'll have to make the blessed trek of parking. If it's just for a meal, do your damndest to find a meter on 3rd or even out front on Tryon. God speed to you!  The crepes themselves? Hard to say about the thin layer of crepe as the varieties we tried were masked by some awesomely pungent flavors. With that being said, I'm sure you can order a more simplistic crepe if you're in the mood for au originale. For those craving concoctions, the Chipotle Chicken and the Mariachi are rather tasty. Though stuffed to the rafters with foodstuffs, it's a nice breakfast or lunch. I really dig the chipotle chicken, but it did have lettuce playing second fiddle to spinach. Really? Not a fan of that at all. Lettuce does not hold up to heat nearly at all and it made a limp mess inside of my crepe.   The prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get. I think most would be full after one stuffed crepe. I couldn't finish mine or the one we shared.   Glad to have finally tried Hazelnuts. Great folks over there.",

I really want to love this place, but I find myself disappointed when they can't or won't make the breakfast crepes all day long. Why do you torture me with the sign outside touting my favorite, the \"Maple Dream,\" if I can't have it? Anyway, the Maple Dream is seriously delicious and I would eat one every day, but I find some of their savory crepes to be only marginally better than my packed sandwich from home. I had the BBQ Chicken Crepe today and it was definitely oversauced - like drinking sweet tomato based bbq sauce with a little bit of cheddar, raw onion, and tiny chicken bits floating by. The Turkey BLT Crepe I tried last week was alright, except for the lettuce inside . This is weird texturally and I need to remember to ask for no lettuce. It's a chilled, crunchy lettuce in the middle of an otherwise warm, gooey, meaty, cheesy filling. Overall, I lovelovelove the breakfast crepes and really enjoy the sweet crepes, but think the 3-4 kinds of savory crepes I've tried so far all fall into \"fancy Hot Pocket\" territory.",

That would be a shame because this was a nice place to grab a made-to-order but quick, casual, and tasty Sunday breakfast. That said, I don't know that I would necessarily go out of my way for a return visit (for reasons I give below).  Hazelnuts offers breakfast, savory, vegetarian, and sweet crepes, as well as \"do it yourself\" options. My friend had \"The Maple Dream\" (egg, chedder, bacon, maple syrup, butter and powdered sugar with walnuts added). If you think of crepes as being very thin pancakes (a la Talladega Nights), then you can see this is like a great American breakfast all in one neat package.   I prefer savory, so I had the curry chicken crepe, with \"medium\" heat (yellow) curry and the heat was spot on and the flavor very good.  So, four star food. I took a star away from my overall rating for two reasons: (1) everything is served on paper plates with plastic silverware, which I dislike for environmental reasons. (2) They charge $1.00 for a refill of a small coffee. Ouch. These two things left a bad taste in my mouth.",

I wish I had room in my stomach to try one of the sweet crepes, but unfortunately, the first crepe was quite filling.  I'm going to have to go back to try one!",

Once I got to the store I hadn't realized until they told me they had no orders, oh and I had to pull that out of them. Long story short 4 people tried helping me one lady decides to continue training while 3 others have me repeat my order multiple times and still got it wrong. When we got back we noticed one card was charged twice. The issues continued even as we called. I use to love this place I will not be back to this location ever. The drama that happened all in one day was enough for the housewives. They had the worse attitudes about the situation instead of trying to be helpful. Even one lady came from around the counter to ask what's wrong but with the worse attitude. Sheesh can't get good service many places anymore.",

Located in the lobby of 200 S Tryon Street, it's a small cafe open 8am-3pm Monday through Sunday (yes, Saturday and Sunday too!).  The menu is quite large, with over THIRTY different crepes, plus a build-your-own option.  There are eggy breakfast crepes, sweet and savory, and tons of vegetarian options.  Two of my favorite condiments, Sriracha & Nutella, are on hand and incorporated into several of the crepes.  My favorite crepe (so far) is the Chipotle Veggie:  mushrooms, black beans, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle aioli, and ranch.  You have the option of adding protein to any of the crepes, and the choices include bacon, turkey, ham, chicken, and tofu.",

Only crepes served, so no side orders of bacon, eggs,  etc. Everything modestly priced $7 - $9 per crepe, 12oz coffee less than $2 (not Starbucks,  but still pretty tasty, better than Dunkin & McDs) for sure.    For a family of 4, we got 3 different crepes to share...Maple Dream, Pig n Swiss, and Not Your French Toast. All were amazing!  My favorite was Pig n Swiss: bacon,  eggs, swiss, spinach, without the red onions. Typical items in an omelet, but much better.  My next would be the Not Your French Toast because it comes with a full serving of vanilla ice cream.  Delicious ending to a Sunday morning breakfast.   Location was pretty convenient. Uptown in the Fifth 3rd building, just up the stairs. For free parking on weekends, it couldn't get any better.  But be careful for Sunday morning cries crowds.  One of the few places open on weekends combined with free parking.    Only reason for the 4 instead of 5, is because of the wait time. It wasn't that crowded when we got there,  but it took awhile for us to get our food.",

Luckily, one of my friends came into town this past weekend and we were up at the ass crack of dawn and hungry for breakfast.  I pulled out my Yelp bookmarks and we aimed for Hazelnuts Creperie and boy they did not disappoint!  We ordered the Vegetarian Southwest Crepe and the Banana Berry Cinn Crepe, cut them in half and both enjoyed the best of both worlds (sweet and savory, that is)!  Crepes are priced just under $10 and portion size is decent and is very hearty and filling.  Staff is friendly. Free cups of water. No wi-fi. Great lounge areas in window and on side, and nice tables by the counter where you place your order and pay.  Grab a seat while it's being made and they'll call you when it's ready.  Cool bunch of customers that come in, lots of earthy looking clientele and a couple of business types who stay at nearby hotels.  Parking is hassle free and literally free on the weekends, so it's a win-win.. don't have to worry about getting towed or finding a space and can fill your belly at the same time!!!  SCORE!  I will definitely come back another weekend!",

It's a cute little nook and is bursting with the smell of fresh ingredients when you walk in. Seating is ample and we had no trouble finding a place.  We opted to split the Florentine and Berry delight crepes. In most crepes I've had, the ingredients are cooked thoroughly and then the crepe is assembled; that didn't happen in this case, but it was still good. Both the savory and the sweet crepes were well-prepared and well-assembled. We'd certainly bring family or friends to this place and will likely, despite our infrequent visits to downtown, start coming more often.",

My biggest disappointment with my visit to this Hazelnuts is that the other Hazelnuts is in a much more exciting place. I was visiting Charlotte and figured the most reviewed Hazelnuts would be the best one. I went to this one on the weekend, and it (and the streets outside) was dead. Later I saw the other Hazelnuts, which is in a much more fun place (7th Street Public Market). If you're a tourist or just not in a hurry, go to the other one.",

In four trips I was able to try something from every part of the menu (sweet, breakfast, savory, veggie), bringing me to the following conclusion: they do everything right.   I'm yet to have a bad experience and I especially appreciate the enormous portion sizes and friendly service. All of the ingredients taste fresh and delicious, allowing you to confidently order whatever your heart desires. There are so many menu options here as well that you really have no excuse to not come back and try other options. Whether you're craving something sweet or something savory, Hazelnuts Creperie has you covered.  The lines can understandably get a bit long during lunch, but you can call-in to place an order for pickup if you're ordering at least two crepes - helpful if you're picking up orders for colleagues! Additionally, I've noticed that the lines during breakfast hours are much shorter - if you can take some time out of your morning to swing by, I would.  One final note: the location is strangely tucked around the corner inside the lobby of an office building, although it's not difficult to find it if you follow the signage (and the scent). Don't be daunted if you don't initially see it!",

I walk past it all the time during the week, and the fella and I decided to check it out for breakfast one Sunday morning. It was actually pretty busy at 9:00 a.m. - who knew?  The fella got the Maple Dream (scrambled egg, cheddar and bacon with maple syrup), and I got The Chunkster (peanut butter, banana, chocolate chips, trail mix, and maple syrup), which also describes me after eating it. After all the hullabaloo about the Maple Dream, I have to say that we both decided The Chunkster was better. There wasn't enough meat in the Maple Dream, and The Chunkster was deeeelicious! About halfway through, it started to almost be too sweet/rich, but I pushed through.   I'd love to try Hazelnuts again for a savory crepe at lunch or another sweet crepe. Great service, casual feel, tasty crepes, and breakfast for two for only $20. Oh, and their coffee was pretty darn delicious, too!",

Whether you get one of their breakfast crepes, lunch crepes, or dessert crepes you're in for a real treat. After finding out I was allergic to gluten last fall I was somewhat devastated, no more Hazelnuts. It didn't occur to me until today while I was wandering around the city looking for a place to have breakfast to ask whether they could provide any sort of gluten free alternatives. When I got inside I asked the girl at the register if it would be possible to make one of their crepes into an omelette. I was told that since it wasn't busy they would be happy to! Score! I was warned that they would be making the omelette on the same griddle where they made their crepes. I'm not super sensitive to gluten so it wasn't an issue for me. I got the Turkey Bacon Avocado and, as always, it was delicious and my day was made",

You simply go up to the counter, order your crepe and take a seat with your number. The place was not too busy so they brought our food out to us at the table. I ordered a make-your-own sweet crepe with strawberries, chocolate chips, and lemon (yes, the combo tasted good!). Very simple yet so tasty. The selection of the savory and the sweet crepes is quite wide and I'm sure anyone can find a combo they would like, whatever mood they are in. I went with two co-workers, one of whom ordered a savory crepe and the other a dessert crepe off the menu, both of which were delicious as well.   The one thing that would make the place better would be if they were open on the weekends or even in the evening hours to serve the date crowd or even the casual crowd. I would enjoy it if I could come in for dessert after dinner uptown or even for lunch with my husband on the weekend. Maybe they are wanting to attract the uptown lunch crowd, but I think expanding the hours would serve it well. Also, perhaps serving beer/wine would complement the crepes. Just a suggestion.   Overall, a great place and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "so, ill admit that ive only had one crepe at hazlenuts. Usually, I think that people should refrain from reviewing a restaurant until theyve had multiple dishes (especially if theyre going to give a five star review......like I just did). However, the one crepe that I have had there (multiple times) is heavenly and I think that it alone is worth the glowing review. The strawberry, walnut and goat cheese crepe is the best crepe ive ever had and as a bonus, I dont feel completely unhealthy after eating it. For some reason, I have trouble getting into savory crepes, even when filled with items that I like. To me, a crepe should be sweet but this means that sometimes feel guilty when eating crepes for breakfast because a breakfast item shouldnt be able to double as a dessert (love donuts for example but I never eat them for breakfast). The strawberry goat cheese crepe helps solve my dilemma because it strikes the perfect balance between savory and sweet. Im certainly not claiming that its health food but its nice to know that thanks to the walnuts and goat cheese, Im getting some protein along with my sugar.  Its pretty unusual for me to go to a restaurant and get the same dish every time since I crave variety when it comes to food but when I walk into Hazelnut, I cant bear to order anything other than my beloved strawberry crepe. Ive heard great things about all of their crepes so one day, maybe I will branch out but I cant make any promises!",
