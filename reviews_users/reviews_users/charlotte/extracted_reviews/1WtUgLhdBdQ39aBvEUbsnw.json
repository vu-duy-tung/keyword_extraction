My lunch was $4, for two spring rolls. Not bad but I can't be sure it was worth the price. The rolls were small and the garnish (curly thinly shredded carrots) and a few handfuls of the small white thin puffy noodles (?) were painfully meager.  I have pictures. Judge for yourself...  I'm sure my daughter will eat there again. Me? Maybe. Maybe not.",

For dinner, we each usually get an appetizer and a roll and with tip it usually comes out under $30.  Nice!    I'd have to say that Felipe is my favorite waiter by far, he has made it a point to remember my boyfriend and I's names, and he's full of personality.  The other servers there are good too, but there have been a couple of occasions where certain ones try too hard to pressure you into drinks, apps, desserts, etc, and one of them always seems fake nice!  The hostess Camela is very sweet, and I look forward to seeing her when I come in.  The sushi is great, although sometimes my roll looks sloppier than other times (I usually get the same one because it's so good).  My boyfriend always enjoys his sushi.  I've also had the curry, and loved it!     If you haven't been to Akahana, you should go.  It's cheap (BOGO half off rolls!), the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good.",

There's nothing spectacular about there establishment nor is there anything outlandishly enraging...except if your a group of 6 or more. Beware! Their practices are a bit sketchy. Parties of 6 or more are charged automatic gratuity (which is fine) however you're charged gratuity on your BOGO rolls. So don't think just because the roll was \"free\" that you won't still be paying for it.  So while the two top next to you gets the privilege of having BOGO rolls and tipping as they wish for mediocre service, parties 6 or more will be stuck paying 35% tip.  Seems like a rip off to me.",

    "text": "I'll be generous and give Akahana 3 stars when it should probably be 2.5 stars. I was a frequent flyer of this place when it first opened, mostly because for a year this nice little bistro who offered buy one get one free sushi rolls. As someone who should probably open her own sushi restaurant to get a return on my investment, anytime I can save cash on sushi is a plus.  A while back the restaurant management changed and switched the deal to buy one get one half off. I understand this a business with profits to make so it didn't upset me but left my sushi-loving soul disappointed. Yet, I only dined here a good bit due to price and not quality... and even though the rolls the discounted, the prices are a bit higher so not truly snagging a discount. The sushi isn't bad by any means but not memorable - nothing that blows me away. At Ru Sans I covet the Firecracker roll. At Sushi 101, I always snag the Sir Justin roll. But I have yet to find an amazing roll at Akahana. Pretty average sushi here with no special sauces, ingredients or anything that makes me crave this eatery.  However, props to the bistro for the atmosphere. It's a sleek, modern design with plenty of room between the booths and tables so you're not invading anyone's personal space. Upon walking in, you're greeted with a waterfall trickling down a tall glass panel that almost hits the ceiling... nice touch. We've always been seated promptly at the restaurant and service is more times than not good. Never had bad service, just slow... and last time I never got my requested side of aioli... blasphemy.  Plus parking is easy and Akahana is located conveniently in Plaza Midwood... no fancy parallel parking here or trying to figure out how one-way streets connect.",

It features \" buy one, get one half price\" sushi rolls.  My husband and I have been here a few times and had an \"ok\" meal.  But this last time?  Holy blow fish!  Did that sushi chef just graduate to a black belt in rolls?  We ordered three vegetarian rolls that rivaled those at our favorite sushi restaurants.  Plus, service was sharp and snappy, to the point that the waiter nearly snatched away my last sip of wine as I lifted my glass.  Definitely warrants an encore and soon. But, I'm gluing my wine glass to my hand.",

Also the food seems to be pretty inconsistent in quality, ranging from 2 to 4 stars on any given visit.  While tucked away and not very noticeable on the outside, the inside is very nice. It's got a nice dark atmosphere, lots of dinning area, stylish decorations, and a pretty nice bar. The staff are all attentive and nice folk.

SOMEHOW  my friends encouraged me to try it one more time- FAIL.  The BOGO enticed me, let me tell ya, if those sushi rolls weren't bogo- I wouldve been soooo pissed off.  Its bogo for a reason folks.  The sushi is awful. Not much different from what I was claiming in 2012.  I tried the cherry blossom roll and the surf n turf. YUCK. My other 2 friends that were with me agreed that their rolls tasted old, just as mine did. My sushi had avocado where some of it was turning in color (old) and the salmon also did not look fresh....or the tuna.... DAMN!  Like seriously guys, sushi isnt your cup of tea.... practically 3 years later....STILL, simply put, AWFUL sushi.  I will never go back, I dont care what kind of luring special they advertise, on top of it all - believe it or not this place is pricey!  Like 14 bucks for something you wouldnt pay a dollar for.  Rusans, in my opinion,  can't be beat in Charlotte.",

Head to the bar where I'm greeted with a super unfriendly bartender who- right off the bat, instead of hello, I get a bristly l \"do you need a drink menu?\"... Maybe she had been having a bad day?

I have to admit that I don't like the music (think at a trendy nightclub) or the decor (the centerpiece is a sheet of glass with water running down it).  However.... everything, for me, revolves around the BOGO sushi rolls.  I can go into this place with a friend and we can both gorge ourselves on pretty good sushi for about 35$ total.  There are usually 1$ PBRs (I know, I know, a very classy way to wash down sushi), so I can have my full \"dine and catch a light buzz\" experience for about the same price.    I've never had a bad experience at this place, maybe some slow service but the rolls I order have always been on point and delicious.  The waitress I have the most often is also super nice, keeps my water topped and my beers coming.  Be warned though, it took me about three visits to figure out what is good and what just looks good on the menu.  Akahana is not world class-but it is a great deal with friendly servers.  Like any great deal you might have to do a little work on your end to make the experience match up to your expectations.  I highly recommend the place, as well as any of the flash fried rolls.  Mmmmmmmm Americanized sushi.  Yummmmm  There are also plenty of big TVs, so kick back and watch something while you stuff your face, I mean delicately pick up your sushi with your fancy chopsticks....",

Ive had bogo sushi in other areas but this is repulsive.  This sushi you can find at a buffet or a grocery store.  To other foodies who are trying this place for their 1st time.......skip it.  You can go to a buffet and get the same quality for half the price.  Even for bogo, their sizes for the rolls are smaller than what you will pay for  at another sushi spot for the same price.   Save the trouble and go somewhere else if you want to go here go to a chinese buffet instead.  You'll thank me later",

We ordered soup and salad each, then two rolls (BOGO), and 6 pieces of nigiri (2 pieces each of salmon, tuna and white tuna. Soup and salad came out in about 10 minutes. It took over 45 minutes for our sushi to arrive. When it arrived there were two heaps of salmon roe rolled in seaweed as well was one tuna and one white tuna. We told the waiter we were supposed to have two pieces of each of tuna and that the salmon was supposed to be the nigiri salmon. We waited over 20 minutes for the correct salmon and additional two pieces of tuna. After the 20 minute mark passed I asked him to just cancel the order and bring the bill. That took almost 10 minutes and when he brought the bill we were charged for both rolls which are supposed to be BOGO and the salmon. If you're considering going here don't. This was my second time and the first they messed up but it was a busy Friday so I have them the benefit of the doubt.   Awful service. Subpar sushi. Just don't.",

My friend and I ordered the drink special for the day, orange creamsicle while the boys ordered beers (they seemed to have a handful of local beers available). Unfortunately, the Orance Creamsicle was a major letdown. Neither one of us liked it at all.....it tasted like some type of medicine!!  We started off with a spring roll each and an order of the crap wontons. Not a big fan of the crab wontons, maybe a bit to much creamcheese and not enough crab! The spring rolls were pretty good though.   We ordered 8 rolls for the 4 of us: a few Bagel rolls, a San Francisco Roll, a cruncy tuna roll, and a few others. They came out on this huge boat which was alot of fun. Someone sitting beside us actually asked to take a picture cause the boat was that cool!  Unfortunately, none of the rolls were that amazing. I mean, the San Francsico roll was by far the best. I loved that lemon on top. Such a light and refreshing roll. The rest were just ok. Not amazing. But not poor either. I don't feel like I have super snobby sushi tastes. Just wasnt a fan of Akahana.....maybe a bit too bland for my taste!",

I've come here a couple of times with some friends who are regulars. We've ordered sake as well, the white peach is the best and Asian pear is disgusting. We had to switch out our sake the last time we were here, wasn't an issue when we approached management about the horrible tasting Asian pear sake. I like the fact that they have low carb and veggie options, not sure if they offer brown rice. I got the Butterfly roll (12) and the garden roll (10) last time I was here and was not disappointed. The butterfly roll is very hearty while the garden was light. I didn't want to go to heavy on the spicy mayo (even though I love it, damn diet). Total was around 22 for two rolls and a large sake carafe. I will be back for more.",

It's so frustrating! They also need more parking. That's why they get 3 stars from me. It's not the food it's the service. Even when I eat in the service isn't the best. However when the owner is there he visits every table in such a fun loving manor. Maybe I'm being harsh?",

Calamari, lukewarm and just \"ok\". Fried soft shelled crab, room temp. Explanation for crab temp was that kitchen did the fry job while the sushi chef did the plating and garnishing and the two weren't in synch. When I heard that, I thought it was one of the dumbest kitchen workflow plans I'd ever heard of. I mean, the garnish and plating was just the crab on top of lettuce. So, here's a novel idea ... why not do that first and have it ready for when the crab comes out the fryer?! Common sense. Right? Anyway, my wife ordered the seafood hot pot. It came out and some genius heated it in a way that the lid couldn't be removed due to internal vacuum inside the pot. Waitress had to take it back and get tech support to remove the lid. After tasting it, maybe it was God telling us not to even bother eating it. Oh, and did I mention that the menu said it would have snapper, but they put salmon in there instead (farm raised most likely)? I guess they figured we were too dumb to notice :) Anyway, I ordered the spicy basil dish. That was a fail. My wife ordered the ginger pear martini. That was a special kind of fail because it tasted like Victoria's Secret body scrub ... pear flavor of course. To end this on a positive note (kinda), I will say that the fried rice was good; just wished we knew there was a $1 up-charge for that when we ordered it. Geez. Anyway ... not going back.",

Ive put enough time in working at restaurants to know that serving sunday mornings at a sushi place is a walk in the park. We ordered a cali n spicy tuna to start, but we received a salmon and tuna roll instead. When the server returns with our \"correct\" order they merely squirted a bunch of sriracha sauce on the tuna roll to make it \"spicy tuna.\" How lazy. Beverages were empty often and had to call out a mistake on the check of charging for an extra roll. I used to love this place since it was so close and convenient, but now the service is so consistantly bad I'm not sure if I will be going back.",

He was on it! He suggested sushi to us and really knew the menu. The sushi was GREAT! Very fresh and not overly fishy. It is a little on the pricy side but worth every penny. I highly recommend this place and our waiter, Gaylin. Everything was so good that we ordered 7 different kind of rolls and endless drinks, our bill was over $100 and we didn't blink twice at it and we tipped Gaylin 50%! Can't wait to go back :)",

I wanted something better than grocery store sushi, but didn't feel like driving any further than I had to since I just wanted to be out of the car.  Then I remembered that Akahana was right next to my house!  Perfect opportunity to give them a try.  I ordered a basic roll... salmon, cream cheese & avocado... and a seaweed salad.  Honestly, I wasn't very impressed.  The roll was decent, I mean it's hard to mess up something so basic, but it seemed like it was missing something... and the wasabi tasted watered down if that's even possible.  The seaweed salad was the crunchiest I've ever had and I'm undecided as to whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.  It had good flavor, just super loud!    Also, it was a Thursday, which the sign said BOGO... buy one get one... but I only had one roll in the box when I got home.  ???",

I spotted a traditional Japanese dining room in the back, near the bathrooms, which would be a cool thing to do with a bunch of people.  The restaurant just opened so they didn't have draft beer yet but the hot tea was perfect for a cold winter night and the wine & mixed drink menu looked comprehensive.  Everything we ordered was very good - garlic crusted calamari, miso soup, three sushi rolls (Dragon which is shrimp/eel, spicy tuna, Mary which is like a California roll).  Service was very good - not pretentious - I think we saw some CAST actors working as well as some other Plaza Midwood neighborhood faces.  I hope this place survives since the location seems to be cursed like the Cursed Pirate Girl (Jeremy Bastian reference y'all).  And check out the used book store next door if you have time - just watch out for their puss who, like most pusses, can be cranky when approached the wrong way.  Cheerio!",

The sushi is fantastic and at a great price (buy 1 get 1 Rolls everyday of the week)!!  The other menu items that I've tried have been good as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone",

If they lowered the prices say by a dollar or so and got some hip music, I think that would definately help. Also like the previous poster stated they also need something on the walls just to make it more homely. Anyway I would recomend it and I wish them the best of luck.",

It's like sometimes they try to hard and then sometimes not all. This past visit we had several mess ups and then felt rushed to leave at the end of our meal. It was only 8:30pm. Food is still great but I think it would serve them well to hire someone to really get the service up to speed. This would go a long way. I'm local and really want to see the place do well but these service issues can cause people to give up quick. I'm very patient but others probably not so much.",

The first thing you see is an impressive Akahana statue type thing with flowing water, and a sushi bar.  We had really great service the two times we went from both the bartender and the server.  Honestly, I went for sushi both times so I didn't look at the other menu, but the sushi menu is very extensive! People had mentioned this place was slightly expensive, but the rolls are huge!  The spicy tuna roll (and it really is spicy) was only $5!  The specialty rolls really aren't very expensive when you take into account that each has a ton of meat inside AND on top.  They also have a beautiful presentation, each roll wrapped in something delicious like seared ahi tuna or avocado slices.  The best part is the $4 sake bombs!  They have specials every day, with B1G1 specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I can't wait to go back and I hope this place sticks around!",

The first bad omen was the mold on the menu. Black mold growing from moisture and stickiness in the menu. Guh-ross!!   I ordered the tropical exotic roll. The menu description was so misleading it made it seem like the soy paper would be cut in designs, but the roll was actually like a sushi quesadilla, but not in a good way.   The other roll I got was meh... The crab tasted like crab out of a can, it wasn't even the imitation krab, which I typically dislike but would've been better.   All in all, I'll probably never come back here. Even with bogo sushi. I see why it's bogo, they want to get rid of it as much as I disliked it.",

But, apparently this place is popular just because of the location and prices.   We will never be coming back. We didn't even stay to eat. Service was so slow and sanitation was so bad that we left (something we have never done). The table next to us ordered after us but were served multiple items before we even got our beers (which took forever). We put cash on the table for our two beers and then left because our waiter never came back. After leaving, we went to our usual, go-to sushi place.   I would dismiss these issues as being the innocence of a rookie server, but the sanitation was also a problem. The tables and bathroom were gross and there was trash all over the men's bathroom because nobody had tended to it in a long time.   This is not the place where I want to eat raw fish. Again, I'm trying my best to be polite here, but this experience was exceptionally bad.",

Dinner rush usually means things are on point. I ordered signature dish, spicy basil with chicken. She ordered deluxe fried rice.   No more than 5 minutes passed and our food was at the table. This is NOT a good sign. Rice was hot, but everything else was luke warm (including meats not at temp). We mentioned this and they took our food back. Not 1 minute more and it was back to our table....nice and microwaved.  The hostess came over, and I said, \"Hey, food that is this quick can't be fresh.\" We sent the food back and it was sent back to us less than a minute! Even fried rice takes more than 5 mins between ordering and completion.\" The hostess said,  \"I am sorry but we can't make everything fresh during dinner.\"  Lose. What a poor example of existence. So many other choices....",

It's not a hip place to hang out, despite the dim lighting and Justin Timberlake booming over the PA system.    The food is consistently fine.. I'm never disappointed, but never blown away.   But.. you can't beat the BOGO deal. Sure, a house special Roll will set you back $15, but then you get another free and that's a cheap date or lunch for tomorrow or a late night snack after the bar.  Akahana is great for a weekday dinner or takeout after a hectic day at the office... Hang out at the fully stocked bar while you wait and enjoy the Timberlake.",

It hurt the entire night so bad that I had to go home.  I got sick later and stayed sick the remainder of the night and AM.

The BOGO is also offered for takeout. The Vietnamese bun is also pretty good and is of good size. The spicy edamame are excellent.   The service has historically been hit or miss but has been more reliable of late. There are drink specials most days, but they aren't always that enticing (like 15% off sake and $1 off beer).   The atmosphere is ok but occasionally it may smell like cleaner (really the only reason for not getting 5 stars). Will continue to eat here for (generally) good value sushi and Asian fare.",

I gave it my best shot though.   My latest trip here was for take out grub. I walked in after yoga. Hot mess express over here. I posted up at the bar, ordered myself a glass of Prosecco and dove into the overwhelming menu.   My selections: Spicy spider, Spiral Ecstasy, Watermelon, and Cherry Blossom rolls. The Spicy spider and Spiral Ecstasy were the winners. I love rolls wrapped in cucumber instead of rice. Unfortunately, the cucumber didn't look all that appealing for the Watermelon.  Four rolls + one glass of Prosecco = $38. I could've easily been okay with just two rolls.   The bartender was super friendly and attentive. He helped me go through the endless list of options. Call it the never-ending menu. I would gladly sit at the bar any time he was working for a meal.  Akahana is a decent little sushi spot. Nothing too fancy. Rolls aren't super creative. Great specials throughout the week. Worth a trip if you're craving sushi in the Plaza Midwood 'hood.",

    "text": "The service was good, but that was about it.  I wanted something asian for lunch and was on my way to the wonderful dim sum place down central when I saw BOGO sushi.  So, I stopped and went in.  The fish at the sushi bar looked good, so I decided to eat there.  The ambiance felt like it was recently something else and they just painted over it and added a fountain.  It took a second for me to be seated, but my waitress was quite responsive.  I opened the sushi menu to see that most of the rolls were about twice the price they should be(at least for this side of town), so this BOGO was really \"you have to buy twice as much to get it for the normal price.\"  I tried to order some hand rolls, but they said that wasn't included in BOGO.  So, then I tried to order some nigiri, that wasn't included either.  I asked, why does it say BOGO sushi, and the waitress told me sushi meant rolls.  I quickly corrected her and stated that no, sushi means rice.  I probably shouldn't have done that, but I don't like misinformation.  I was feeling kind of cheap but was really hungry so I went with the hibachi chicken.  There were many other options, and I guess I chose the worst.  First I got my salad, nothing special, but not bad.  Then came my food, a nice sized plate of food.  Little bits of chicken and such with a nice sized order of rice.  Oh, it was so dry, I really didn't enjoy it at all.  I guess I should have gone with the over-priced sushi, but I doubt I will return to find out.  Sorry guys, there are sooooo many sushi places in town these days, gotta get me on the first impression.",

I do love some of their rolls, even when they mess up my order its usually still good. The BOGO offer (all day every day eat in or take out)can work in your favor, and sometimes you're not saving anything. Fancy rolls? sure, definitely could use a half off. Generic/veg rolls? No thanks. Yeah, I'm getting half off my california roll but they charge $9 to begin with, double what other sushi joints charge, so not really a great steal.   I'm slowly venturing off their sushi menu. I really like their hot and sour soup, a lot. The stirfrys are alright. I've tried almost every appetizer and although I don't have a favorite, I also don't have a \"never order again\"... though the ginger dressing on the house salad is more often than not so bitter it ruins everything, so I usually skip that.   I'd like to go in and enjoy my meal more often, but even when there's only one other table I still can't get my server to pay attention to me, so I'd rather just skip the whole \"service\" part. And it's really nice they're open late on the weekends!",

    "text": "Meh if you want sushi in the plaza area and don't want to drive anywhere then I guess this place would be acceptable in a crunch, but I wouldn't go here as a destination. Friend suggested we try this place out since they do BOGO sushi. Great love a good deal and fresh sushi!   Unfortunately, Akahana offered neither of these things. First the sushi is definitely Americanized in terms of everything having cream cheese, panko, spicy mayo, and being deep fried. Yes, they have a few rolls that are not adulterated with saturated fat, but for the most part it is very heavy on American style sushi. Great for some people, not my style.   Secondly, their BOGO offer is a sham. Ordered two rolls as they are BOGO at about $14-16 a pop. I'm expecting a decently sized and well prepared roll for $15. Unfortunately the rolls come out and mine was missing the crab on top - didn't say anything because our waitress was never to be seen again. Additionally the rolls were extremely small in terms of filling. In most other sushi joints the same roll would go for about $6-8. So if you do the math on that ....you aren't really getting BOGO in terms of value. You are being sold an idea of BOGO predicated on inflated prices that ensure you're paying full market value for each roll. Don't get me wrong, I get this is a business and profit is important, but come on? $16 for a small roll that isn't even prepared with all the listed ingredients? Then you try to convince me I'm getting a deal by getting a second subpar roll?   I won't be back personally since I could get the same sushi cheaper at Harris Teeter across the road.",

    "text": "Akahana...hmm. There's not really many positive things I can say about this place.  I was in the mood for sushi and saw on Yelp that they have a daily, BOGO deal on their sushi - even for take out orders - which sounded good to me.  They are located in a strip mall right across from the Plaza Harris Teeter. Based on the time of day, the parking lot can get tight and spots fill up quickly.  When I walked in, I was hit with a strong body odor aroma. Oddly it was only at the entrance. Once I walked inside, the stench was gone. At the hostess desk, I placed my order for two rolls: the Florida and furious dragon rolls. My total for both came to $16 and change. While I waited, I noticed how unkempt they keep the restaurant. Everything needs to be renovated.  The hostess brought me my food and once I got home, I was pretty disappointed that avocado pieces on my furious dragon roll were already turning brown. The sushi rolls tasted no better than what can be found in the sushi section of the Harris Teeter across the street.",

We got the Golden Gate/San Francisco roll and the Maui Wowie roll. We loved both of them. The flavors worked great together. We also got the Shrimp Pineapple fried rice which we loved. It was served with half of a hollowed out pineapple which was a cool touch. If you're looking for good sushi at a great price, you should definitely check this place out!",

The service was wonderful, but it did take longer than usual to get our food, and there wasn't a crowd. Their BOGO deal is good, especially when you factor the cost of one roll. If you're in Plaza and don't want to travel around the city, it's still a decent spot.",

    "text": "Was in the Plaza area of town this afternoon so I stopped into Akahana for sushi. I was met by a young lady who had an upbeat, bubbly vibe. She was very professional & made sure I had everything I needed throughout my time there. I sat at the sushi bar and had nice conversation with one of the chefs, who is opening his own Akahana in Belmont soon. The thinly sliced fish in the prep station looked fresh and was very colorful. I had the Raging Demon roll & the special Stupid Cupid roll. Both had eel, which I favor and were tasty & thankfully, solidly packed so it didn't fall apart (pet peeve of mine when it comes to sushi). However, I always enjoy alittle fresh, chilled ginger to finish my meal but their's was tainted beige and browning on some edges. Now here's my primary complaint: the odor in there is nasty; That dirty floor, wipe-counters-with-the-same-rag-over & over again- kind of smell. Now, I know I'm somewhat OCD clean & germ conscientious & I challenge myself to tone that down.  So I dug deep & stayed and ate but I prayed I wouldn't get sick all the way home! I know I  can't be the only one who senses some slacking in cleanliness there.  BOGO so I had two 8-pc.rolls for $15.00 + $6 tip (on the full amt., as is customary) = $21.00 and I was stuffed. Will I go back? Nope....no need to. Too many other, sparkling clean sushi places to visit!  3.5 out of 5 because the rolls were good and the staff was excellent. They just need to hire a new cleaning company to use some vinegar/bleach & steam that place from top to bottom. Or refinish and update the interior  :- /",

    "text": "Located in a dingy strip mall, it would be easy to overlook Akahana - but, you would be missing out on some very tasty food.  I eat here a couple of times a month and always enjoy my meal.  Akahana is most often reviewed for their BOGO sushi rolls, and while the sushi is fine - I prefer to dig in to the rest of their menu. There are a number of items on the main menu that really standout, including the Signature Pho served with thinly sliced steak served on the side to allow you to determine how long you want the steak to cook in the pho, the seafood hot pot with snapper, shrimp and scallops in a light oyster sauce, the red curry (I like it with the tofu), the spicy tuna/avocado bowl and the vietnamese crepe.    Pho tip - if you don't want a bowl full of noodles, you can ask them to sub veggies for the noodles for a couple dollar upcharge.  On those days I'm watching my carbs (they come and go), this is an excellent option!  For dining in, try to get a table on the right side of the restaurant (the bar side).  The left side of the restaurant has harsh fluorescent lighting and a completely different feel to it.    If you order takeout, be prepared to wait.  The orders often pile up and it can take a while for the host/hostess to sift through all of them.  Also, be sure to check your takeout order before leaving - as, sometimes special requests to the orders slip through the cracks.",

The owner, Ian, came over multiple times to welcome us to Charlotte as our server told him we just moved here, and asked us probably 5-6x how we were doing and if there was anything else he could do to make our dining experience more enjoyable.   On Fridays the Saki is heavily discounted at $17/bottle compared to the usual $34/bottle. The BOGO is the COOLEST thing about this place. Seriously any roll you get is buy one get one free of equal or lesser value. Not to mention the sushi was so fresh and so deliciously prepared that I quickly fell in love with this place.  I've lived in Charlotte for 1 week and I think I've already found my favorite sushi spot! Highly recommend to locals and all those traveling through!",

After a lovely rainy stroll through McAdenville last night, my fiance, a couple of friends, and I decided to test the waters.  Service: The service was great. We were seated immediately and our waiter was very attentive throughout the evening. Only issue was that it did take quite a while to get the food out.  Selection: I am not sure I have ever been anywhere that had such a great selection of sushi. They even had some Christmas specials. Everyone got two rolls (because bogo) and no one's rolls overlapped.  Food: Damn. I'm going back tonight. First, my rolls were huge. Six pieces each, but definitely bigger than most rolls I've had at different sushi establishments. I had the Maui Wowee roll (I was on a plane to Hawaii a year ago today) and the Snapdragon roll. EAch was awesome in its own way. the Maui Wowee had some jalapeno pieces in there, so it was a fair spice, and the Snapdragon was topped with mango, so a good balance to the jalapeno. No one at the table had ANY complaints.  Price: Akahana is a little more expensive that most sushi places, but where else is there always bogo rolls? well worth it.  Like I said, will definitely be revisiting Akahana sooner rather than later. They also offer carry-out if you just want to swing by after work.",

I only order one roll and add spicy mayo to the order, but recently they use ingredients different than stated on the menu. It's so frustrating that it's not even worth the buy one, get one half off deal anymore.  I used to rave about Akahana, but not anymore. The spicy edamame is the only reason I gave them two stars.

Plus, we live in the 'hood and I want to help keep something going in this spot.   I should be upfront about the fact that we were not in the best mood that night, so when our extremely sweet and upbeat served came around and announced that she'd just tried eel for the first time last night and then really, really, really wanted to give me her suggestions from the sushi menu I was not thrilled. She took my suggestion rejection like a pro, to her credit, and proceeded to place our order. On the plus side, it came in a very reasonable amount of time. On the minus side, yikes. My order was a couple of rolls and several pieces of nigiri. The rolls were okay- not remarkable. I ordered some maguro. It was whitish-pink-grey. It smelled very strong. It was decidedly not ahi or it was in such bad condition that it was unrecognizable. When clearing the table, my server wanted to know if there had been a problem with it, insisted that the chef told her it was maguro, and then after my explanation of how it should look didn't take it off the bill. Sigh. Akahana, we're breaking up. Though I will never return, you might want to hire some servers that know about sushi and have a talk with your chefs or suppliers. And add some kids' menu items.   (I am giving you that two stars out of the goodness of my heart- I really should make it less.)",

If you get it extra spicy they add jalapenos in it. The sushi here is just okay, but its a lot cheaper than other mediocre sushi places considering its buy one get one free. The other entree dishes are not that great. Their fried ice cream here is also good. Overall I am a fan of their pad thai and that's why they are getting 4 stars. :)",

We've had the salt and pepper calamari on multiple occasions - sometimes delicious, sometimes over cooked and inedible. Food inconsistency is such a bummer. Most recently I called in an order for sushi take out. When picking up my order, I asked the attendant (whom I later found out was the manager) for some low sodium soy sauce. He seemed annoyed that I asked, grabbed a small, unmarked clear plastic container and handed it to me. Upon arriving home to enjoy my meal, I noticed an odd fishy smell about my food. Noooo! After a couple of bites of sushi I had to stop and toss it --- the rolls tasted like funky fish! I called Akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, I didn't take him up on it. I also didn't ask for a refund. I did however ask him to visit his kitchen and investigate why my two different sushi rolls shared the same fishy taste and smell. I suspected it was the rice or the nori, but who knows. I'm sad to say it because I love supporting Plaza Midwood businesses, but I will be taking a break from this spot for a while. I hope things improve.",

I would say that about 40% of my orders have been incorrect. Having said that, when they get it right, it can be very good food for a good value.  I just wish they would get their act together.

    "text": "We began with the pineapple drink, which was *sigh* served with the pineapple intact - drink was a little weak for 15 dollars.   We decided to share a sashimi boat with some sushi rice on the side.  They brought us our miso soup and salads, which were pretty good.  Unfortunately, we waited an additional 10 minutes for our sushi boat, which came on a plate and not an actual boat (of which, we saw many were available.  We examined the sashimi platter and everything seemed normal, until we got to the end, and there were...about...8 pieces of imitation crab.  My boyfriend and I looked at each other incredulously, thinking that, maybe we got the wrong platter.  After confirming with a waiter that this is indeed the sashimi boat that we ordered, the anger set in.  We could not believe the AUDACITY of serving imitation crab meat in a 40 dollar sashimi boat.  After confirming that this is a legitimate, we spoke to the waitress who ended up informing the manager of the situation.  The manager came and took away our plate and replaced the imitation crab with 4 pieces of octopus and a few additional salmon pieces.  Even with the replacement, the sashimi boat was not worth $40, since the actual fish sashimi pieces were sliced incredibly thin.  When we got the bill, we discovered that they charged $2.95 per bowl of rice.  Overall, we found this experience to be extremely underwhelming.  We would not recommend eating the sashimi at this restaurant.",

For dinner, I had the Spicy Basil Chicken (again, not spicy except for the jalapenos mixed in). The service was decent, but could have been better. But the food and the atmosphere are fantastic.

    "text": "We finally tried this place out after hearing both good and not so good reviews from locals in the 'hood. First things first, we went on a Monday night, at 7 o'clock and the electronic/techno music was so very loud that we sat at the table closest to the door in hopes it would be somewhat muted. Not so much. They even turned it up at one point and we were literally two out of, oh, five customers in the joint. There was no dance party goin' on. Seemed to me like they were trying to take a page out of Nikko's book, but there is a reason (actually, several) that I avoid that place at all costs. I like to be able to hear my husband talk and not watch him wince as he tries to eat sushi while his head throbs with pulsing bass. Our service was average, and since business was slow, we got lots and lots of walk-bys from the rest of the waitstaff and managers. Hovering is the best way I can describe it. I am a server myself, so I get the sometimes uncontrollable desire to harass your tables with attention when it's slow, but this kinda felt more like they were watching to see if we were going to steal the chopsticks.  On to the food. We shared two sushi rolls, the standard Dragon and Caterpillar. He likes eel, I like soft shell crab, so it's the usual for us. Both were decent and nicely presented, no complaints. We also had shrimp, pineapple, and cashew fried rice and the portion size was huge. Definitely enough to share, although hubby would have gladly put it down by himself I think. This was, of course, after we both added a generous amount of Siracha, as the dish was pretty much bland without it. It was listed as a \"Thai\" dish on the menu, so I think we both expected some heat, but it was missing. The rice and shrimp, however, were both perfectly cooked. A little bit of regional cuisine confusion on the giant menu was the downfall here, I think.  We both had bellinis that were on special and they were pretty lackluster. The drink specials catered more to the party crowd (like the music) with stuff like sake bombs and red bull and vodka being featured instead of more dinner-friendly options like wine or beer.  For the record, my review is 2.5 stars. I want to like this place and will go back to try some other things....just probably from the take-out menu this time.",

The quality of the fish is amazing, I have been to a lot of sushi places in Charlotte, and this is one that I will go back to again and again.   They have a lot of variety in Asian cuisine, and usually I wouldn't say that that is a great idea, but Akahana is able to pull it off! :)  I have also tried the rice noddle dish and Pho and both were just like the way my mother makes it! Perfectly seasoned and super fresh!  Highly recommend Akahana Bistro and Bar to anyone!",

Or the food is mis-ordered, glasses sit empty, and one time my plate actually sat behind the counter for 5 minutes only to have another patron ask to take photos of my food (another 5 minutes) before it was served.    #2:  I love love LOVE the BOGO sushi, I always get the wasabi roll and depending on who's working the sushi bar depends on the amount of wasabi mayo they squirt all over it.  It's easy to scrap off, but come on!  Also, the tuna was alittle disturbing of a color.  I do love their specialty rolls though.  #3:  Great drink specials, and if they make an awful tasting drink (at least to your preference), they have remade for myself and friends, so props to the bartenders.  All in all, I frequent this place because it's very close and I love the location (grab a few rollls and parose the book store or library) and I'll keep going back",

Yep, you heard me right, Everyday, which is a good thing so I don't have to wait for a Tu or Th to enjoy some good, cheap sushi.   I'm a vegetarian and I loved the rolls that my sister and I ordered. We got the fresh, vegetable laden Zen Roll which was scumptious. And for free we got the Sweet Garden roll with came with a sauce drizzled on it which was really damn good.   Our server was really sweet and attentive. No complaints. The only thing I can say that it was a bit empty. I'm sure things will pick up though or if nothing else, we'll be back very soon. Thank goodness, it doesn't just have to be on Tuesday or a Thursday!",

    "text": "First of all I come here just for the sushi. I've tried most of the dishes and the only one I like is the lemon grass chicken dish. As an asian, none of the food are authentic at all. Don't get pho because you can spend money at vietnamese restaurant that can taste way better for a cheaper price. So the boyfriend and I ordered togo for the first time, the person who picked up the phone was a young man with brown hair? I can't recall. But I had a couple of questions and I think I can be the reason why he messed up my order. But he repeated back my order before we hanged up... and he forgot to tell me the total amount of my order. When we get there it seems like they were busy. I tipped him because I understand how it is. And because he answered my difficult questions. When I got home and looked at the food... I didn't get my order right. I ordered sushi and it was fine... BUT i ordered vegetarian sushi and it was next to my boyfriend's dragon roll. It wasn't a big deal for me... but for other vegetarians it might be. So please put that into consideration!  For our meal, we ordered lemon grass chicken and flat rice noodle with chicken. I don't know why.. but he messed up the flat rice noodle dish. Instead, I got a Chicken and vegetables with no rice... and I got a side order of flat rice noodle with just vegetables and no meat? WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? How do you mess this up? Because even though I tried eating the chicken and vegetable dish it had no seasoning. It needed salt and sugar. It was so bland. I swear I come back because I want to see if there's a great dish that I haven't found... but I think its because there isn't. I don't even know what and how much I paid for... I can't even refund my money because he didn't hand me my receipt. Half my fault that I didn't ask... but c'mon. Youre running a business here. I shouldn't have to ask for a receipt... I'm the customer. A receipt should be handed to me.",

The sushi itself is a step above grocery store. I had the spicy tuna roll and the cherry blossom as well as a few nigiri. Fish didn't taste sashimi grade fresh and was sliced very thin. It was more veggies and just a pinch of fish. It's certainly good for bogo prices but not for full price ($12-15 per roll). Overall not terrible but not great sushi. Just go for the bogo.",

The sweet garden roll was cucumber, avocado and asparagus topped with tofu. The other roll was pickled burdock root. Very good for you. I also get the veggie dumplings and they are a favorite. I get them steamed as well as fried. I haven't tried it but from what I've seen the teriyaki chicken is a good choice too.",

Mind you, the sushi rolls they've come up with are not especially creative and I find that far too many of them have fillers like cream cheese that I'm just not looking for. (If I wanted shmear on my salmon, I'd have a bagel.) But it does have some redeeming qualities. The menu is very very long but you can pretty much skip the whole middle section because, although they list many Vietnamese options, these are not their forte. You'd do better to go down the street to one of the many Pho restaurants in Plaza or Eastland.   There are a few of the sushi rolls which I do like a lot, but I find it difficult to find multiple I really want each time. The seaweed salad is delicious, and the in-restaurant serving is generous, but the take-out serving (although the same exact price) always leaves me wishing I hadn't paid for it.   I'd say the most economical thing to order at Akahana is by far the soup. They're very reasonably priced (I love the egg drop and my husband always goes for the wonton) and they come in HUGE bowls, perfect for warming you up on a chilly day.   Dogs are allowed on the patio outside as long as they are on leash and behave themselves.",

We ordered the pineapple drink to share which tasted like pineapple juice we were told it had three different rums in it. The decor was basic. The sushi wasn't that great it didn't seem fresh.

I didn't send it back, but we didn't use the small plates with food visible on them. Our sushi came out in a timely manner, but the quality was just okay. Their rolls are BOGO free which is a great deal, but they mark up their rolls for that reason. Again we ordered 4 rolls and only had to pay for 2, so that was nice.  They do have takeout and a lot of people were in and out getting orders to go. Maybe their non-sushi menu is more tasty than the sushi, but we probably wouldn't make a special trip to go back.",

Other personal favorites in our house include: crab wontons, Japanese garden rolls with tofu, seaweed salad and chicken lettuce wraps.   Go for the bogo Sushi and eat until you pop!",

I've tried a couple of different sushi places and this one gives you more bang for your buck when it comes to chef specialty sushi rolls. I feel like every other place I've been too charges the same price for these rolls or more. The spring rolls are an amazing app to start with and next time I go I'm going to try the pineapple shrimp fried rice seems like a fan favorite. I took my friend for the first time and he loved it ordered 4 rolls compared to my 2. I would name some of the few rolls I've tried but there are so many. One of my favorites is the deep sea roll.",

The rainbow roll did not have the wide assortment of fish I was expecting, but it only seemed to have tuna, shrimp, salmon, and some other pale fish. All of it was delicious though. My review is missing one star because it was awfully muggy in the establishment and it was uncomfortable. Otherwise, the food, atmosphere, and staff was nice.",

I rarely have high expectation for restaurants that have huge menus and broad food styles.  Akahana serves up the usual suspects from the usual Asian countries, and they do an admirable--though definitely not spectacular--job with their food.    My pho was tasty.  I've certainly had much, much better pho, but, as previously mentioned, I never expected to consume the best of anything here.  Ginny had a few sushi rolls, all of which I considered to be on par with similar items at Sushi 101.   If you're in the area and you're hungry for a decent meal, Akahana fits the bill.  If your expectation is to have the most fabulous Asian dish you've ever experienced, this will not fit the bill.",

    "text": "After four visits, I'm still not sure how to feel about Akahana.  The portions are generous, the drink specials tend to be good, and the sushi is very solid.  The service is less awesome, and the chef is kind of a [euphemism].  Does this add up to a 3?  Let's see:  The menu seems to be around 55 pages long.  Maybe not 55 pages, but it's a tome.  There are a wide variety of southeast-asian dishes; some you're familiar with, some you likely aren't.  Everything I've had has been solid but not exemplary, nothing's been bad, and I've never sent anything back.  (Except for a bottle of sake once -- it had gone south, it was awful, and I really don't want to think about it.)  The sushi's quality is good, but not as good as can be had elsewhere for the appropriate premium.  I'd say it's fairly priced, maybe even a little cheap if you count the buy-one get-one-free sushi roll nights (Tuesday and Thursdays, limited selection of rolls).  Some of the rolls are creative, some standard.  The spicy tuna is, as advertised, spicy.  The atmosphere seems to be aiming for somewhere this side of a dance club.  Given some of the upright glass and the half-height dividers, it's perfect for a John Wu-style gun-fu shootout, especially with their typical music selection, which the kids might refer to as 'phat beats'.  I'm not sure whether this is a plus or a minus.  It's not a place where you're going to have a serious conversation.  The service is, as mentioned above, less than stellar.  Often inattentive, obviously disinterested, not guaranteed to have heard what you ordered, but definitely not stressed about remembering it.  Plentiful parking, and next to an incredibly well-supplied collection of wallet-draining used books.  Easy to get in and out of.  Summary: Good food but not fantastic, iffy service, John Wu.  3.",

Have eaten there many times, and all the sushi/sashimi I've eaten there has been really good..soups too....and I'm a big guy (6'2\" 275) and I don't know where the complaints about small portions comes from; i can order 2 rolls and a bowl of miso soup and be full. Plus they run GREAT cheap drink specials on beer and liquor drinks (a $3 Yukon Jack drink in a regular glass thats a good stiff drink..C'Mon, thats killer!!) As far as service I've never had BAD service, most of the time is decent to pretty good, they're always really friendly, and as far as helpful, itsa daily BOGO menu; the ingredients are on the menu and how its fixed; thrift a litlte CAY-ASH and go out on a limb and try something new, if u don't like it you've haven't spent much money.

But hey if the sushi is worth it I'll pay. That was not the case with this place. We started our meal with spring rolls. They were what was typically expected, except the shrimp wasn't deveined..yuck! After that we order two rolls. I got the crunchy tuna roll. I did enjoy that they put panko it, so I was able to get the crunch without it being fried. It was topped with avocado, which wasn't very fresh. It's certainly not something I'd order again. The service was friendly and fast. Although I didn't enjoy their sushi, I wouldn't be opposed to trying some of their other cuisine.",

It looks good.  There is a random hidden room (near the bathrooms) that looks like it would be a great room for a private party.  The sushi is average to above average. I had the Floridian- I thought it was good, it could have been spicier though.  The menu is big- so non-sushi friends can still tag along.  The prices are reasonable- on Tuesdays and Thursdays a lot of the sushi is half off.  I want to like this place. I want a little sushi place in Plaza Midwood- people want this to work.  The Bad:  It is average. The only reason why I will go back is because it is so close to my house and the competition is not strong in the area.  The waitress was sweet. Incredibly sweet. However, she informed us that she does not eat sushi. She did not know the menu. She was unable to offer suggestions. She looked in over her head. It was like having a vegan server at a steak house. It just didn't work.  I think this place can do well- even with average sushi- but they really need to have better service. Average food and average service does not make a lasting restaurant in a strip mall.",

The rest was 'just fine' especially for those prices.    I liked the 'green' chopsticks - instead of the throw-aways they had plastic ones that were heftier.  Great job on that guys!    The bar service was better than the table service.  Try not to come at peak hours on bogo night and I am sure the service would be better.

    "text": "Hey Akahana, lookit you, all sexy with your buy-one-get-one-free rolls on Tuesday and Thursday. Mmm. Yeah, you know what I like.  So, I didn't try the rolls. During this Lenten season, I gave up sugar, both simple and complex, so no rice for me. However, I did try a wide spread, which was delectable.  FOOD: Mmmmsashimi, you never let me down. Their sashimi platter was presented beautifully, with long strips of delicate fish, fashioned into rolls. Very fresh, no odor, and a lovely selection of your usual tuna, salmon, white fish, and mackrel. I also got the squid salad, which had just the right amount of ginger kick to it. The only disappointing part of my meal were the green mussels. I'd never seen this selection on a sushi menu before, so curious, I ordered them. They tasted just like regular mussels, but perhaps a bit more tough. Let-down. :( On the upside, they do make a fabulous dirty martini, and I hear good things about their $2 martini nights on Wednesdays.   SERVICE: Attentive and playful, though not without fault. Was brought the wrong thing twice (wrong martini, and the clams nigiri-style instead of sashimi), but both instances were fixed in no time at all. We did feel like we were being rushed out towards the end. We did spend a while talking after the meal, but there were plenty of seats available, and we were still tossing back a few drinks, so it shouldn't have been an issue.  ATMOSPHERE: Chique, club-like atmosphere, with bold colors, modern lighting, and a very nice back-lit bar. The sushi bar seems a little secluded from the rest of the restaurant, but overall, this place has a modern and sexy feel to it.   PRICE: Average pricing for all items, but great deals on the specials mentioned beforehand. Definitely worth checking out.  Overall: It's nice to know there's a  place where I stuff my face with decent sushi even when I'm broke. Thank you, Akahana.",

We had a lovely waitress who was well-versed on the menu and, in general, I thought the service was great.    My main beef was with the menu.  Every combination and permutation of asian food is on here.  And that's not so good. When a restaurant has a menu this large, I immediately think it is not living up to its potential because it is spreading itself too thin.  It makes more sense to do a few things extremely well then a million things kind-of ok.  In an effort to please every possible restaurant-goer, the restaurant loses it's identity and does itself a disservice.  Is this a Thai place?  Sushi?  Chinese?  I have no idea.  I hope this place resolves its identity crisis and pares down the menu because I would love to see a restaurant (other than Subway) on this little corner of the Plaza succeed.",

There is also plenty for non-sushi people. It's on the pricey side for being in Plaza-Midwood. It's a little more expensive than Jade on some rolls.  Basically: If you don't care too much about paying for good sushi and don't get your feelings hurt on customer service.",

    "text": "I was at an event nearby so I had the opportunity to stop by Akahana for dinner. It was overall a decent experience. The atmosphere is definitely on the louder side but we had 0 wait for three people on a busy Friday night so I was impressed with the efficiency of their staff.   Starting off with the appetizer, the Agedashi Tofu was really good and I was surprised by the large portion of the dish. Usually when I order Agedashi Tofu, there's a lot less so this was definitely a 5/5.   We ordered the Dragon Roll and Sunflower Roll with the buy one get one free offer and both rolls were excellent. I am a huge fan of eel rolls so both were really delicious especially the sunflower roll with mangoes! I am a sushi fanatic so I have pretty high standards when it comes to sushi and the rolls I had definitely exceeded my expectations.   We also ordered the Deluxe Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai. The fried rice was a 4/5 for me. The flavor was very good and the rice and ingredients tasted fresh. The Chicken Pad Thai was a 3/5 for me just because I've had better Pad Thai with better flavor for a cheaper price. It was still good but the dish could've had a stronger flavor.   Overall, I would definitely stop by for the sushi. There's a lot of variety on the menu and I would love to come back and try more of the rolls. The service was also excellent and our waiter was very friendly. 10/10 would stop by next time if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I haven't been back since years, and this time was a big disappointment!  Picking this place knowing that they're not busy around this time, hoping to get food fast for my 2 y/o who was very hungry (3:30pm) Came in and not one single worker was out. So we sat down ourselves; totally fine.  Later I see two girls came out & one finally approached us &  asked for our drinks & what we would want order. Asked her if I can get a few more mins since I want to make sure I was getting something that my daughter could eat . We waited for the LONGEST time for her to come back.I was watching them both in the back on the phones showing each other something , talking,  laughing . My naive self wants to believe they're probably trying to figure something out or some. A good 15 min went by and no one even looked this way. I finally waived them down for attention and another girl took my order then asked if I wanted the all food to come out at the same time so I told her  I told yes! Like i mentioned, it was not busy at all, but our food took a very long time to come out. (ordered shrimp tempura udon, couple of sushi rolls  & shiu Mai) finally  the food's out  , but she told me shiu Mai is  coming soon. I asked her for a small bowl and then she walked away. I looked  at my udon, and there was nothing else, but just the udons.  So I waited thinking she would come back w/ the bowl right away , to ask about  the shrimp that was supposed to be with my udons...but nope.. About  10 min of waiting , wondering where she went bc at this point my daughter's stomach was growling and I'm getting irritated. I got up to look around and no one was to be found . Went back to seat and finally I see a different guy (maybe the cook) came walking out and asked him if he can get someone to come help me.  About another 10 min, my shiu Mai & shrimp tempura that was supposed to be with my udon finally came out , and once again.. I still needed that bowl. Note this; there was also another guy who came 30 min after us , also had to sit him self down but he ended up  getting his food BEFORE my girl finally was able to bring everything out for us. I came to realize it was around the time for the 2 girls to clock out, which explains why they were just SLACKING on service. despite it all, the food was actually good (explains my two stars)",

The decor is a little outdated and it's snugged in the corner of a little shopping center. We came here because we were interested in checking out the Buy one get one sushi rolls. All of their rolls are available for this offer. We got two speciality rolls and decided to split the pad Thai.   Everything came out super quick. I was impressed with the portion of the pad Thai and it was very tasty. For the sushi it's what you kinda expected. It was OK, but don't think I would go back just for sushi as there are so many other places around here that have amazing quality for roughly the same price.   On the plus side they offer drink specials every day - including the weekends!   My final take away- if you're a California, fried tempura kinda sushi eater this place is for you. If you like raw, melt in your mouth sushi - you'll want to pass or get something else on the menu.",

The two for one sushi promotion is allllllll the reason to go, this includes raw sushi, and hey it's pretty yummy! The sushi was fresh, I wouldn't recommend the Green Eggs and Ham-achi roll, it was mushy and blah, despite it's cute name. The bagel roll, if you like deep fried was DELICIOUS. The only reason for the not great review was the so slow service, we kept getting refills on our drinks because it took so long for us to get our dishes, and to pay our check. I understand they were packed but it was a crazy long time. I also think they should install fans outside or even box fans because of the humid summer weather this would definitely increase the people count outside.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to check out this place, so I finally stopped in for lunch today...  I used to be a frequent diner here (way back when?) when this place used to be a Chinese restaurant, and I've always loved the patio dining area. Well, that area still seems about the same, but the restaurant has changed quite a bit as it went from Chinese to Japanese. Not sure if it's better or worse than before. Anyway, I entered the restaurant a little before noon, and it was fairly slow...only 6 tables full of guests.  I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, as well as 2 plates of Maki Rolls since they offered the \"Buy One, Get One Free\" Makimono Special. Each Maki plate (approx 8 slices of Maki Rolls) is about $15 each, so I guess you're getting about $8 per plate.  Chicken Lettuce Wraps were pretty good, though the Lettuce wasn't super-fresh. As for the Maki Rolls, I went with the suggested \"Deep Sea Roll\" and \"Bagel Roll\". Not super fancy or unique, but they were both good...and super plentiful! I actually counted, and there were closer to dozen rolls each! If I knew they were such hefty order of rolls, I probably would not have ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. No matter, a definite Plus for their generosity!  Both the hostess and the waiter were friendly and courteous...and so major complaints on service.  Overall, it was a nice, laid back lunch experience. I can't say this was one of the best Japanese I've had in town, but I liked it enough to return.",

I understand it's busy so I'm not knocking the place for that. It's their rolls!!  Customer service is awesome!!! Our server was too kind. It was too crowded for me to experience an ambiance.

I was so tempted to order more food, but my two sushi rolls and the delicious appetizers that my friends ordered for the table were plenty enough! One friend ordered the shrimp shumai and pork gyoza (both steamed, of course) and another friend ordered the spicy edamame... all of which was delicious!   The service we received was excellent and the sushi and sake were great as well. My one friend did not like one of her rolls though and I cant blame her because it was very odd. She ended up getting a crunchy roll which was literally just that. It was filled with crunchy topping and nothing else, then topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce (I think). Either way, it was the strangest sushi roll I had ever seen. I'm a sucker for Asian restaurants though so I would love to come back here again!",

I loved The Plaza Roll and it could have been spicier, the jalapeno on top is a nice touch. I gave four stars as the tuna sashimi was not very good and was but very thick.

I am happy to report the patio is dog-friendly.   I was torn between a non-sushi dish and sushi, but after hearing about the BOGO deal it was a little hard to pass up. We ordered a spicy tuna, spicy salmon, Cherry Blossom and a Florida roll. WOW. This was a ton of sushi. Super happy I was sharing with someone. The sushi grade didn't feel like the best, and that we were eating the bottom of the barrel, but I don't think that would stop me from coming back.

We went with the following rolls: gulf to bay, spiral ecstacy, orange blossom, and earthquake.

I'm not a sushi snob, so I was very happy with the flavors and grade of sushi we received.   They have drink specials each day and on Mondays (when we went) there was 1/2 price bottles of wine.

Later I saw that manager go hang out right off the patio area where his friends were congregating and smoking (non restaurant customers). Smoke was coming from both directions. Unfortunately the inside is always freezing.  They also keep going up on their prices so it's expensive if you only eat one roll and can't take advantage of the b1g1 deal. I do enjoy their sushi and their fried rice is some of the best in town.",

Parking can be a pain sometimes as the strip mall isn't the easiest to navigate, but once you get past that, decent variety of rolls available as part of the BOGO (no substitutions please) and while the freshness, creativity and presentation of the sushi here will probably never be confused with some of the higher end places around town, in terms of value, it is hard to beat.",

Sushi is fresh and selection is just OK... Too many similar options on the BOGO. Cream cheeze and spicy mayo... Not real sushi to me however there are other good choices. 3. Ambiance is ok, decor and lighting is nice. 4. Every single staff/waiter/bartender I have dealt with has the personality of cardboard and the customer service skills of an ant. Not friendly, not even interested in your needs or if you're ready to order or leave. I just had a take out box handed to me as the bartender rushed by. She shoukd be putting the food in the box for me. That's too bad as I want to like this place but the staff suck. There goes her tip.  Order carry out and skip the hospitality... Or lack thereof.",

So I dutifully read reviews from some of my favorite people on Yelp before heading over to this place so I thought I knew what I was getting into. BUT unfortunately I was still disappointed!  Let's start off with their bogo sushi \"deal\" $14 for two rolls is pretty standard for a basic sushi place but these rolls were the SKIMPIEST I have ever encountered. The fish on the outside of both my rolls was paper thin and the roll itself was about the circumference of a quarter. So for $14 I would have been better of going across the street for sushi at Harris Teeter.  My wife is not a sushi person so she got one of their rice dishes which came so over salted she could not even eat it:(  I will say what I assume was the owner or manager of the place was all over the restaurant checking in with guests which was nice to see. If he had asked me how my meal was thought I would have told him I was a pretty disappointed.   I really want this place to be better so I might keep an eye on it because I would love for it to be more like New Zealand Cafe:)",

We waited 30 mins to be seated, then ONE HOUR after ordering our food for it to come to the table. We never complained to the waitress (only because we didn't get a chance to- she never acknowledged that we had been waiting so long; never apologized that we still hadn't received our food). Then the manager came over to our table to tell us our food was on the way and apologized that we had to wait 40 mins. We were livid at that point, because it had actually been an HOUR, not 40 mins. Her response was \"well, according to the ticket, your food had been entered 40 mins ago\". Our response was, \"yeah, probably because the waitress entered it 40 minutes ago, but we had actually ordered an hour ago\". Her response was a snarky \"your food will be here shortly\". About a minute later, our food finally arrived. Mine and my friend's sushi were missing rice on some of the sushi rolls; it was as if they expediently and sloppily prepared them. My husband did not enjoy the two rolls he ordered. My sister's non-sushi dishes were barely palatable. Truly awful experience for all of us. We will not be back.",

Leanne C.'s review pretty much sums up our experience there. I got told I could have cake, then the cake was a lie, then there was cake again. Quit playing with my heart! I would've ordered some food to go with the cake if you hadn't taken almost an hour to bring it out of the freezer. My love of dessert for dinner is unrivaled, but this was really crappy cake that I ended up giving away because I couldn't stomach it's frozen sickly sweetness. I suggest that you inform people next time you're serving them cold chocolate cake because I kind of envisioned a warm fluffy moist piece of chocolate yumminess.  Service was awful, bad, below mediocre, crap, pick any negative adjective you like. Sake was ordered at the start of the meal and came out near the end after we had said we didn't want it anymore since it was so late, at least our server realized how big of a mess that was and comped us for it.  I hate the stupid BOGO deal, just price your stuff reasonably because I don't want to always eat 2 rolls when I come here. I think I'll have to end my relationship with you here for a while Akahana.",

I rarely write reviews, but I was so upset that we paid nearly $60 for a terrible dinner that I had to warn others to not eat here. The ordering process was fine and the girls that work the front are very nice and helpful. However, the food itself is just horrible - NOT what I would expect for $13-$15 entrees. As one example, the flat noodle dish came with most of the flat noodles congealed together in what was supposed to be a \"sweet brown sauce\" that was actually a soupy, bitter tasting oily sauce that left a horrible aftertaste in your mouth. The sushi, which seems like a great deal because it's buy one get one, was meh at best. The rice paper wrapped appetizer roll was filled with lettuce and some noodles, completely tasteless and instead of the promised peanut sauce came with a clear fish sauce. (The sauce is a personal preference, but the roll itself was spectacularly underwhelming.)   I am so shocked that a place like this can exist, with all of the great restaurants we have now in Charlotte. I promise, I am not one to call out anyone - as any place can have a bad night. But I was so thoroughly unimpressed and so upset over spending so much money on something so bad, that I had to let everyone know.",

So I ordered a veggie roll (8 pieces, $12. Are you kidding me?!) and my friend ordered some sort of salmon roll (8 pieces, $12 also...). Jimmy ordered chocolate cake.   And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.... and 20-40 minutes later, we were finally served. Jimmy's cake was literally one of those generic three-layer-take-out-of-freezer-and-thaw cakes. Super sweet, cold and high in preservatives. Sushi places usually have some sort of mochi, ice cream or sweet rice- not here! My sushi was barely cut all the way through and not laid out too nicely. It was pretty disappointing.  The server I have had before and he was awful and not very attentive... I thought it was maybe because he was doing prep work at lunch. Thennn there was this time. He wasn't working any other tables once we ordered and the service was still awful. Miscommunication with the bar (my friends ordered sake and it came INCREDIBLY late), Jimmy's cake (they said they were out of cake after 20 minutes, then brought some out 10-20 minutes later), and of course a long time until we got our food.  Oh Akahana... tweak your staff, adjust your sushi prices (get rid of the buy one, get one free and just make them reasonably priced), lower the terrible music and get some decent desserts. Then we'll talk again.",

The sushi rolls are nearly double the price I pay at other locations.  $12 for a typical roll with tuna, avocado, cucumber and a special sauce and it's is mediocre in size?  Yeah, I better be getting a second one!  The service was good and I thoroughly enjoyed the $2 martini specials.  The curbside appeal was bleh since it's located in a strip mall.

    "text": "I've gone twice more to Akahana and either my taste for sushi has become a bit more snobbish or Akahana has gone a bit downhill.  Let's first start with the atmosphere, serious techno beats at 6:30pm on a Thursday is not relaxing. The lights were bright - and it's not really a club atmosphere so why the club music? I am not a big person by any means but I felt as though I was sitting in a little kids chair, I could not imagine if I were a bigger guy.   We started with the spring rolls which were downright gross in my opinion. The pork just had a really funny flavor and they were over-cooked. My boyfriend ate them, but he eats everything ...he even said so himself, so I doubt he really liked them either.  We split four rolls 1) Florida- good flavor, the avocado was fresh and perfect. The tuna is that mashed chopped-up kind and it was just be so much better if it was just a nice small piece of raw tuna.  I also felt like all the rolls were a bit warm.  2) Orange Blossom- Again with the chopped tuna, but at least they had a nice salmon piece. I liked this roll flavor-wise but again with the oddly warm temp.  3) Surf & Turf- It was ok, but I prefer cowfish Burgushi. The meat was just odd ( couldn't tell if it was lightly seared, raw etc.) Just not a huge fan  4) Spider Roll- Worst spider roll I've ever had. It was inedible for me- I had one slice and gave up. It honestly tasted like it had sand in it, even my boyfriend had trouble with this one.   So overall awful atmosphere + lackluster sushi means I probably will not be returning BOGO or not.",

I can't help but compare the BOGO deals to those in Raleigh. In Raleigh, almost every sushi place has BOGO all day long. If restaurants keep making their sushi cheaper and cheaper, that's fine by me - as long as it doesn't go down in quality. When I found out Akahana offered BOGO rolls, I thought I'd check it out. Wasn't the best but I couldn't get over the smell right when I walked in.   I can't even remember the rolls I got, I came here a month ago, but the rolls were so lackluster, I don't remember what they were.   Food is average - maybe even below average. Service was good.

    "text": "It's taken me a while to finally get this review down...and I think it's because I really want to love Akahana but, overall, I just kinda like it. The interior is pretty slick, the menu a large Asian compilation, the staff was friendly and efficient but overall, the food was what held back this review from a 4 star. This ambivalence has delayed my review, but here we go.   BOGO sushi every night now. Yup. Every night. While this is pretty great (as our bill for four rolls and an appetizer was under $40) it's also a little worrisome. Did Akahana jack up the prices of all the sushi to accommodate this special? Or, instead, are they serving smaller or fish of a lesser quality? Well, while the portions were ample, the sushi tasted fine, but not great. Here's the run down.   Asian Summer Roll: 4/5: A fresh, nicely stuffed shrimp Vietnamese inspired spring roll with a thick dipping sauce. Go easy on the sauce.    Spicy Tuna: 3/5: The spicy tuna, while it tasted fine, was strangely very, very red. Like atomic red. Kudos for not slathering the tuna in mayonnaise, but the bright red color frightened me.  Crunchy Tuna Roll: 2/5: Too heavily fried for my tastes and again with the fire engine red tuna?   Cherry Blossom Roll: 4/5: Fresh, tasty and delicious. I would go back just for this roll.   Mt. Fuji Roll: 3/5: A little too sweet  - if I recall correctly it was topped with mango and a too much sweet sauce. Could be delightful if it was suaceless.   I may head back to Akahana for lunch or to pick up some sushi to go...it's definitely worth another try, if not just for BOGO!",

Went back for the second time and they had already changed the menu!!  They had taken off some things I had seen on the first one!  One of them being what I had orderd!!  Ended up getting chicken and vegetables in brown sauce.  Had about two tiny pieces of chicken!!!!  The rest was rice and veggies!  Very disappointing!  Tried it again and the red curry chicken was a little better.  If I'm gonna pay for chicken I want some chicken!!  The service is good though and so are the drinks!  That's the only thing I will go there for!",

    "text": "Conveniently located on the corner of The Plaza and Central, Akahana is a nice little bistro with great potential.  There are plenty of things to like about Akahana, but definitely a few glitches to this place.  The Good:  1. The location: I can't think of any other sushi places in this area, and it's just a hop, skip and a jump away for anyone who lives near this neighborhood.  2. The decor:  It has a kind of trendy look, but some nice decor.  The bar area is very cool, all lit up.  The waterfall at the door looks great as well.  It's a little dark, but fairly cozy-looking.  3. A huge menu: Their menu is very large, with a great selection of appetizers, sushi rolls, noodle dishes (different Asian styles), salads and more.  4. $5 lunches: I am not sure what time lunch ends, but in addition to getting lunch-sized portions of food, you can also get $5 at certain times on weekdays.  They have sushi lunches, noodles, and a few others.  They have pretty decent portion sizes for $5 too.  5. The drink menu: They also have an extensive number of specialty drinks.    6. The spicy edamame:  Not too hot, but full of flavor (maybe a chili sauce mixed with teriyaki?).  The OK:  1. Buy One Get One Half Off:  All right, this is a pretty decent deal (it's every day all day), and they offer it on pretty much all of their sushi rolls.  The rolls range from like $5-18, depending on what you're getting.  Their specialty rolls start at around $9 and up.  They are pretty decent sized rolls too for the price.  2. The quality:  The fish quality is ok.  It's not as fresh as Yama or the Cowfish, but it's decent.  The sushi rice is pretty good, with just the right texture of stickiness and plenty of flavor (the right balance of savory/sweet, not too sweet or vinegary, with hints of sesame).  Some of the rolls are downright delicious, but some are just mediocre.  3. The drinks: The cucumber martini was very strong and not quite my style, but probably good for people who really love that brand of vodka.  I had one drink (I can't remember the name) that was pretty decent, but not very heavy on the booze.  I had their sangria once, and it was decent but watered down.  The Not-So-Good  1. The service:  I have had decent service once, but two other times it has not been great.  It was virtually dead in there every time I've gone (I've only been there at a late lunch time). In three trips, I have not once gotten my appetizer before the rest of the food, so the timing is a little weird.  Overall, A-OK is probably an accurate summary of my experiences here.",

I felt like throwing up so I stopped eating and drank the beer I had ordered instead. After a while I though I had second guessing myself and tried another piece. It was the same bad stale taste. I stopped eating. I think I had two pieces out of the 10 or so on the plate. I lost my appetite altogether. BUT, the  worst was when the waitress came by to hand us the check. She asked me if I needed a box for the remaining sushi. I actually said in an almost apologetic tone  \"mm.. sorry I actually didn't like them at all. I couldn't eat them\".  She looked at me without any expression and nodded and said \"Okay\" and went away.   The LEAST I expected was for her to ask me what was wrong with the sushi. I would have told her gladly. Anyway, I will not go there again because this restaurants sucks.   The Akahana at Baxter village is much better. A better crowd comes there and they are much nicer to you. I think it's a SC thing!  BOO AKAHANA. Two thumbs down.",

    "text": "Today was my first visit to Akahana and I won't be back. There were about 9 tables (including people sitting at the bar)  total in the restaurant and only ONE server. She could hardly keep up. There were dirty tables and spots at the bar everywhere because tables weren't being cleaned quickly enough.   Other customers were looking around as I was almost seeming to wonder \"Where is our food?!\" Our edamame appetizer sat in the kitchen window for 5 minutes before being brought to us. I know this because I saw it sitting there.   Our 2 sushi rolls (not fried) took about 35 minutes to be prepared and served to us. I noticed there was only 1 sushi chef. I'm not sure if that's typical for a holiday day lunch shift but it probably shouldn't be. The younger gentleman sitting at a table behind us sent back his sushi roll because \"the crab tasted funny\". Not a good sign.... We almost walked out before getting our sushi rolls but felt bad so we stayed. The rolls were nothing to write home about. In hindsight, I wished we had gone somewhere else instead. We could have eaten almost anywhere nearby for a quicker, cheaper, tastier lunch.   They do offer Buy One Get One sushi rolls. Our check with 2 rolls and edamame and a soft drink was $24. It would have easily been at least $35 if we had paid full price. Thank God we didn't.",

Their rolls are about half a roll from most other restaurants, so you're paying $14 for 2 mediocre halves.  2) AVAILABILITY: Tried to order some a la carte nigiri and sashimi.  Pretty much everything I tried to order was unavailable and has been \"for MONTHS\" (per our server).  Uh... then maybe don't have it on your menu.  Then the waitress said the restaurant doesn't order it because they don't make money on it.  Uhhhh... then maybe raise the price? I think people who want uni or toro will understand that it will cost more.  3) VARIETY: Sure, variety is the spice of life, but I don't trust an Asian restaurant that serves multiple different Asian cuisines.  I only tried the sushi so maybe the pho, thai curries/noodles, udon, and teppanyaki is really good... but dubious.  4) SERVICE: Our server was adorable and nice, but she was not good at her job.  Her timing was so bad it was comical and it provided us with entertainment.  E.g., she would only come to take food/drink orders when one of us was in the bathroom.  Also, she never blinked.   TL; DR -- Wholly unimpressive; BOGO is a gimmick; service is bad.",

    "text": "Akahana has a very trendy interior. The lights are dimmed and there's a blue tone that circulates the restaurant. The only issue I have with this ambiance is when I come for lunch. The entire restaurant seems too dim compared to Mr. Sun shinning oh so brightly outside lol Of course you can always choose the outside seating, which is nice during a cool afternoon.  This is the typical fusion restaurant with a very extensive menu. They have Vietnamese, Thai and Sushi. I just don't expect a restaurant with a broad menu to have amazing \"omg, I have to live here\" food (which is my normal reaction to a restaurant I love :P), but Akahana is decent. It's a good place to go when you're indecisive or if you have a large crowd with different tastes.I've tried all three cuisines here and the Vietnamese dishes are my favorite.  Reviews for all three cuisines:  The Vietnamese dishes are very affordable. I believe all dishes are $10 and under. The pho is pretty good, but it varies. From experience, it is really good on Wednesdays lol I'm not really sure why. The Pork Chop Rice Platter is my go-to plate since it has never let me down! It comes with grilled pork chop, an egg, rice and vegetables. Very delicious and filling! I would also recommend the \"Vietnamese Shaking Beef (Bo Luc Lac)\" and \"Seafood Crispy Egg Noodle (Mi Xao Don)\" I think most people will be overwhelmed by the Seafood Crispy Egg Noodle. It is a stir fry over a bed of fried noodles. It is HUGE and looks like a bird's nest lol   The Thai dishes are also affordable, about $10 and under as well. I've only tried the Pad Thai and I wouldn't really recommend it. The flavor is decent, but the noodles are never done correctly. They fall apart with every bite.  SUSHI! The sushi rolls are generally more expensive than other places (prices comparable to Cowfish, but not as yummy). Though the sushi is BOGO so it's decent. My favorite is the Spiral Ecstasy Roll! It comes with three different types of fish and avocado! :D The Tropical Exotic Roll is interesting. It's a sushi dish but it comes in triangles. I didn't really care for it (the presentation or the taste), but my friend thought it was unique.  Overall: decent food, affordable prices, trendy atmosphere, but nothing out of this world amazing",

The calamari was great, lightly battered, with a sauce that is slightly sweet and tangy.  Salt and pepper wings were spot on as well, i think its double fried because the wings were larger than what i've seen.  Most importantly, the rolls were bigger than what i've seen at other places, and the prices were average.  The staff were friendly, mostly college students, between 20-30s, fluent in English.",

(it was the one with the tofu skin forgot the name oops!) Pretty good! My mom had the posideon roll & IT LOOKED SO BOMB! She said it was really good, better than the place we usually go to(Yama). Atmosphere was nice, service was supper slow though. They had like 2 workers but our waitress was nice. Overall I would come back since it's BOGO which is a super duper awesome deal, and deff plan on trying their other items on the menu!",

The wasabi rolls had chunks of wasabi, which is not how it was described. The spicy tuna wasn't shredded and it just looked like raw beef. The vermicelli bowl was fine. The stir fried veggies were fine, but much more expensive than the price advertised on the menu. The waitress took a long time because she was too busy talking to someone for a long time. The owner came by and asked how things were. We had to ask him for the check twice before he finally did it.   1 star; if I could give it 0 I would.",

After all that, the sushi was underwhelming.  Never again.",

    "text": "Where Akahana isn't an incredible location based on locale, they definitely pack a punch with a sushi menu of note. Checked these guys out for lunch after a long awaited and needed visit.   The decor is actually pretty swanky. I really like the waterfall with the glass logo behind it. Pretty snazzy. Cool bar setup, too.   We ordered a ton of sashimi and a few basic rolls. Check out my photo from the sashimi/nigiri platter. Gorgeous presentation. Fresh, flavorful and service was very fast and direct from the chef over the counter.   My biggest dislikes are the prices and the TVs. Prices do seen a little steep, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was well worth it. Can't say the same if it weren't for the buy one, get one half off deal. Probably wouldn't go back if it weren't around. And the TVs. Just yuck. Jerry springer and other garbage channels on all of them and the sushi chefs were glued to it. Kind of funny, but really disappointing. Daytime TV + sushi = no thanks.   I can say I'd be back, but maybe for a change from the regular sushi go-tos. Cheers!",

    "text": "Naturally, the first thing I do when trying out a new place is check out the reviews on Yelp and when I checked it out for Akahana, many people mentioned how bad the service was. I wanted to be the one who proved them wrong, the one to show everyone that Akahana would be my new, wonderful go to spot with terrific service but I'm sad to report I'm not that person.   I don't know if it was because they are newer and are drawing in quite a crowd on Thursday nights and the servers are overwhelmed but the service was almost non existent. We practically had to flag down our waitress to give her our order, get refills, etc. and I contemplated throwing a chopstick at our server to get her attention but with my luck, that would've either a) turn into a lawsuit or b) get violently ill from sushi gone wrong.   On the flip side, $17 for two rolls, a salad and a beer is A-Ok in my book. The sushi? Holy wonderful, fresh, yummyness batman! I was surprised by how fresh it was and how much flavor it had packed in the rolls. Some mentioned that the rolls on BOGO nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays) were smaller but I felt they were appropriate sized pieces for what they are charging (I can't remember the names exactly but got the Furious Dragon and Sweet Romeo roll). The downside about BOGO nights is that there isn't any vegetarian options on the BOGO menu and it says no substitutions on the menu.   The vibe was good-very vibrant with orange walls, moderate volume music and packed. They have a moderate sized bar area complete with the regular stuff you would expect-ESPN, Japanese beers and specials galore.   I will be back to check out Akahana.....but only when I have nothing planned afterwards so I won't mind waiting so long for my sush.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Akahana. The interior is very tastefully decorated and modern. They have one of those cool waterfall-walls just as you walk in. I wanted to be 6 years old again and stick my hand in.   The place was clean, and the service was also really good. Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. I'm stuck between a 2 and 3 star here, because the entree black bean veggie stir fry dish my companion got was actually decent. What knocked it back was the STALE seaweed.   Aside from the black bean veggie dish, we ordered agedashi tofu and vegetable tempura. They were out of buckwheat noodles, and I can't eat regular noodles or udon anymore, unfortunately. So I stuck to just some appetizers. The tempura was adequate, but it's really not something I'd order again. The vegetables were undercooked on the inside and I wasn't fond of the taste of the batter.    The agedashi tofu was not anything I'd ever seen or tasted, and I *love* agedashi tofu. If it's ever on a menu, I have to order it. What I got here was awful. The tofu tasted old and dry, there was a thick, poor-tasting (old oil?) batter. On top of all this were a few strips of really horribly stale seaweed. The manager(?) noticed we barely touched the dish and she tried to say that it was a \"firm\" tofu they used, so that's why it might have tasted differently. I don't usually play the race card, but she was telling my white companion this while I was in the restroom. When I got back, she just smiled and left. Firm tofu? I've eaten tofu my entire life, whether firm or soft or medium or dessert or silken or chunky homemade or whatever. Question: Why even offer a menu item if you don't make it even remotely right?   They get a plus for having brown rice, but a minus for not having buckwheat noodles; a plus for great decor and good service, but a huge minus for having items on their menu they can't cook properly and also for having poor quality ingredients (read: old).",
