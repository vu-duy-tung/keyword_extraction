Ride the light rail in, hang a right on Donaldson and it'll be a couple blocks down on the left.  You can't miss it, IT'S A RED HOUSE.  :)  Seriously though, I've been going here with my wife and have tried just about everything and not once have I been disappointed.  Go.  Now.  What are you waiting for?  The staff is all fantastic,  the owners are the sweetest most amazing people.  Do yourself a favor and go.",

The Red House misses the mark in many ways and I wouldn't recommend anyone trying it for themselves. Pasta looked like it came from a can, toasted hoagie rolls passed off as table bread - and a cheesesteak with potatoes in it (yes you heard right - potatoes). Save your time while in Noda and go to one of the reputable establishments. Would have asked for a refund if we weren't with a group and in a hurry.",

I ordered a chicken parm hero which also comes with fries or o-rings...which made the $13 price a little more realistic.  The sandwich was probably the worst attempt at chicken parm I have ever had.  The bread was terrible, like mass-produced hamburger roll terrible.  The chicken was clearly a frozen patty diced up and swimming in canned sauce and covered with cheese that was melted, however not browned so that just screams \"I was microwaved\".  I had high hopes since the neighborhood desperately needs a good Italian spot, but was quite disappointed and won't be back.  If burger king still served their Italian Chicken Sandwich, it would be head and shoulders better than my experience at Red House.",

The owners Jimmy and Jodie are really nice, they give the restaurant the family style vibe Noda seemed to be lacking. It's the perfect spot to take visiting relatives or friends from out of town who don't want bars or tacos. I've heard people complain about the prices but I don't really think there's an issue. It's by no means cheap bar food so don't expect those prices, but you definitely won't feel like you're paying too much. And once you see the owner make your lunch and you taste the best thing you'll eat all week, you won't mind paying $10 for a sandwich. Also they nail their serving sizes, you gotta get the fries because they give you too many and they're amazing. Overall, I'm extremely happy to call these guys neighbors. When you are hungry in Noda and feel like sitting down and eating something healthier than Jack Mac, this is the place to do it. absolutely the most underrated spot around!  They also have awesome desserts! Jodie makes all their pies and cakes, they have the best in Charlotte without a doubt. Cheesecake is the classic but there's so many there you should really just try them all. They also got the ice cream bar in the back, so you can skip pop bar and get a good old fashion cone!",

    "text": "Red House Cafe... or Sam's Club Lean Cuisine sample handout? From the moment we walked in, we were accosted with an overly loud karaoke singer, an unpleasant host, and walls smattered with Hobby Lobby clearance section \"art\". We were seated quickly and unintelligibly questioned by our whispering host turned waitress about what drinks we would like before having an opportunity to look over the drink menu. We asked for waters to start and when they came, ordered a beer and a cider along with mozzarella sticks, again unable to hear whatever the waitress/host was muttering under her breath. The appetizer came out promptly and was actually decent, but I'd be happy with mozz sticks from Applebee's in a pinch, so who cares. We finished the app and were discussing loudly about the food we'd already decided to order because our waitress/host was nowhere to be seen. Be mindful, there were only 6 tables occupied at the time. When our church mouse of a waitress/host reappeared, floundering like she was serving a wedding party of 200, we ordered our food, fettuccini Alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs. Simple, right? The food came out timely. Mine was as described, while my girlfriend's was missing the garlic bread. I flagged down the other waiter and asked if she could get some bread, to which he made a joke about the waitress/host not liking her. Uncomfortable. The garlic bread was more than likely butter splattered on a hot dog bun with a dash of garlic salt. Then we tasted the food. Mine, the fettuccini, was mostly thick milk and overdone soggy noodles with a couple specs of pepper from a shaker. Hers, the spaghetti and meatballs, was Ragu at best with the aforementioned soggy noodles and to top it off, raw meatballs. The meatballs looked fine until she cut into them revealing raw hamburger meat. We stopped eating, decided to ask for the check and put our plates to the side. I told our waitress/host that the meatballs were raw and I didn't want to pay for that entree. She dropped her jaw in disbelief and briskly walked the plate back to the kitchen. She came back with our check and a mumbled apology and some explanation of how the cook does the meatballs and that every other one that day was cooked thoroughly. Needless to say, we will never return. If you're a big fan of unseasoned Lean Cuisine but are too lazy to microwave one yourself, I'd suggest this place for you.   P.S. we spent $40 (after removing the price of an entree) for this garbage.",

My boyfriend and I visited a while ago, and we both enjoyed what we ordered. The meatloaf was super, and so were those potatoes! When we visited, they had a limited menu and no wine/beer, but I can't wait to get back and try something from their full menu! Welcome to Noda, Red House!",

This is a family owned restaurant and the owners are absolutely wonderful. The food is great (pasta, salads, and sandwiches) and the bakery sweets are heavenly. Staff is all very attentive and welcoming. Love that they remodeled one of the old original mill houses and kept its character. It's nice to walk in and feel like you're getting a home cooked family meal. I would highly recommend!",

It was a \" no brainner\", that I had to try them. They were awesome! Topped with real butter and \" to die for\" genuine maple syrup. I had a side of bacon, perfectly cooked, and superb coffee! The service was excellent and the atmosphere delightful. They play a very nice selection of mellow, yet upbeat music, and no commercials!   I was by myself, so I sat at the bar. I struck up a conversation with the fellow next to me, who had worked there as a waiter in the past. Turns out he's a regular there, because he's in love with the food. I can certainly see why!  Jimmy, the owner, came by to say hello. Nicest guy you could ever meet. In fact everyone there are so so pleasant. They really make you feel at home! I was amazed that the restaurant was sparsely populated. This place is a well kept secret! Part of me hesitates to write this review, for fear that in the near future, it could well become difficult to get a seat once the secret is out!",

Cafe implies sandwiches and soups, but the menu has an odd combination of Italian cuisine and bar food (i.e. mozzarella sticks). The casual decor and home-style ambiance implied low prices, but all of the pasta entrees were around $15, which I found to be wayyyy too high for the quality of dining experience.  Goose and I ended up ordering the homemade pizzas, which both the hostess and server talked up. Perhaps we're spoiled by quick service pizza establishments (i.e. Blaze, Inizio), but it took over 30 minutes to make and bring two personal pizzas. The pizzas were actually pretty good, which is what saved this review/experience.  All in all, it's way too pricey for what you get there. I recommend they lower prices ASAP or else I predict they won't be around very long.",

I knew it was a humble exterior and hoped to be greeted with more than a few \"southern charm\" quotes about sweet tea on the walls inside, but that's the extent of the vibes. The menu was fairly large. Mostly southern spins on food and comfort tastings. There were vegetarian/veganish options so it worked.   The service had little knowledge about the menu and seemed to be spread thinly; oddly enough there were only three tables in at the time.   We ordered. We waited. Waited. Witnessed a Togo order wait an extended period of time and then decline his order once he received it because it didn't look very good. Waited more....Asked where our food was (we ordered a salad with no meat, an omelet and veggie burger with fries). We waited more. 1 hour after ordering our food arrived. Subpar display and a Taste that matched.   To the defense of the staff; they apologized and offered free cookies/bakery items, but it was too late. We literally didn't have any time to spare we had been there for two hours and were late for our next adventure.   Save yourself the time and maybe go in for a Pastry or wine.   This was my plate I ordered the veggie burger, no bun with sweet potato fries... looks a kids meal.",

    "text": "I'm a big supporter of new and old businesses in NODA since I live here and want to see them succeed. Win-Win all around with everything in walking distance.  Red House Cafe (RHC) is a cute red house that serves Italian style food with a few other options like sandwiches, burgers, salads and deserts. Finally got around to trying RHC during the first heavy snow fall of 2018. I have to admit I was expecting so much more with the food quality, presentation and taste from the dinner service. The service was ok since there was one person on tables but also working the wine bar which is expected it's freaking snowing outside.  We ordered the chicken teriyaki and the meat loaf. The presentation of the chicken teriyaki was a bit mushy like and wish the menu would have mentioned peppers, onions and potatoes. The asparagus was softer than my liking and wish it had been skinned as it's easier and more pleasing to eat. The succotash was great.  The meat loaf had good flavors but way to much breading added. I tasted more of the breading than actual beef. The mash potatoes were extremely buttery to where you could barely taste the potatoes. The green beans were very mushy and again buttery so didn't really enjoy it. We also felt for the price of the wine we would have received more and they should splurge on wine glasses with stems. This could have been what was available because of the weather but wanted to mention.  We believe this was a one-off because of the weather so we'll try dinner service again and heard great things about their breakfast so we'll be back. I definitely plan on updating my review based on next visit.",

The environment seemed nice and intimate.  The side salad was not the freshest. The Italian dressing was very basic. The baked ziti was not good. There was no baked, cheesy top like you would expect.  The sauce and cheese were mixed together like a vodka sauce, I prefer red.  The noodles were way over cooked.  I like al dente, and this was far from it.  I couldn't eat it.  I was pretty depressed over it.  The bread is good.   Ok so, I had high hopes for this place. The menu looks good and there is a variety of foods to choose from, perhaps I chose the wrong thing.  I would be willing to try this place again and see how the other dishes taste.",

I ordered the alfredo with chicken which was low on sauce and flavor. I didn't even want my left overs. My friend got the hot dog with onion rings. Again disappointed. The hot dog came with soup chili on it soaking the entire bun creating a hot mess you had to eat with a fork and knife.

    "text": "Went to eat there on a Sunday night because we wanted some Italian food.  We both really enjoyed our meals.  I had the meatball sub and my wife had the ravioli.  We both ordered side salads (hers came with it).  We both left with a box.  I really enjoyed the meatballs and their sauce was excellent.    We ate inside because it was hot, but the outside area was really nice.  When the weather isn't so hot, it will be a great spot to hang out.  The inside was bigger than I thought it would be too.  Service was average.  I felt the place was a bit pricey overall for simple Italian food, but I would go back.  I am happy to have them in the neighborhood.",

There's a nice bar upfront, a selection a baked goods and the dining area set a bit off back.   We ordered some minestrone soup and the Italian sausage with peppers and onions. It's was delicious!!!! Our waitress was so adorable and so attentive.   It's a great spot that I would frequent. Oh, they also have a walk up window where you can order ice cream and other desserts. In the summer they'll have a great patio with all sorts of games (ie Corn hole, bocce ball, etc). Best of all the patio area/walk up windows is pet friendly!   The owners came out and chatted for a bit.  They insisted that we try the ice cream which was delicious! Especially, the banana pudding! They were super nice.  Overall a great experience! Definitely check it out!",

Here was my painful journey:  I wanted the wings to be good.  They were potentially from frozen.   I wanted the sandwich (Cheesesteak) to be good.  It wasn't.    My friends wanted their food to be anything of value (Chicken Parm sub and also a Cheesesteak)  We cried in tandem as we paid $100 for 3 people.   I wanted the desserts to be awesome.  They were subpar except 1 which was decent.   I wanted there to not be a room outside that we kept seeing the employees go in and out from and when asked were told it's where the employees rip cigs because they are slow.  It exists.   Red House Cafe may be appropriately named because I don't see them being in the black on the balance sheet any time soon unless they make drastic changes.  BOLO for a \"Coming soon...sign for this location. Better odds on that than betting on Red House Ca  Glimmers of hope:  Outdoor patio is a great venue.  Their breakfast (Blueberry Pancakes)   Yet to try the ice cream...",

Let me start off by saying I am veryyyyyyyyy picky when it comes to Italian food cause I cook all kinds and I'm Italian. The red sauce was ok, needed more basil and garlic in my opinion but everyone has their own version. Our daughter who is 15 liked it. The fettuccine Alfredo sauce needed alot more flavor.  The meat sauce was very good. I had the chicken parm sandwich and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Great outside seating area and their mimosas pours are awesome.",

    "text": "The name of place made us think cafe- we were looking to have coffee or tea. We looked in and saw the bakery display so we went in only to discovered it was a dinning restaurant. We were going  to  walk out as we were not as hungry for a meal. We lingered to admire cute dinning area in front with  wide window,  then we saw their specialty \"wine shake\"! Ok this got  interesting. So we took the bait and decided to give this place a try. I head up not ordering the wine shake coz after more understanding of what  it is  , I thought it would be too sweet for my taste. My friend ordered beer. I  ordered white  wine instead and I got warm white wine. We ordered nacho chili, chili itself was decent but we had to remove  the nachos coz it had a weird smell (not smelly bad , but smell that nachos shouldn't have). My French fries were dark and limp. We were glad we did not order more than appetizers.  Good: cute front dinning area with window. Great beer menu especially how it was written with comparison to popular beers. (Meaning if you wanted  to know  how their specialty beer would taste like - they list mainstream beers that are similar to it.) Bad: server that knows how to  serve wine. Food is questionable.",

They even accommodated one of my gluten-free friends by leaving off the breading on her chicken.  When it comes to service and hospitality, Levi our waiter, Randy the manager, and Jimmy the owner get it.  Ate last night out on the backyard patio and it was wonderful!  Under the shade of a huge oak tree, our party of 7 were treated like family (the good kind ).",

I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich with fries. The sandwich was tasty though it could've used more seasoning/flavor. The fries not so much, they were very crunchy. I did enjoy my dessert. They are all homemade. I recommend the pineapple carrot cake. I plan to visit again to try some other things on the menu.Did I mention they also have an ice cream shop in the back of the restaurant. I'm definitely going back for that.",
