I ordered the Pho Combo and if I didn't know better it tasted like someone added soda to the broth. The noodles were clumped together and the meat didn't seem fresh.   We really wanted this to be our new spot for Vietnamese, but the cost and quality of the food is just too disappointing.",

The server told me one of the items on the menu wasn't available, \"We don't have it\". Unless you get water, they bring you styrofoam cups that are smaller size than a small at a fast food place.   Food (2 stars) - The fried calamari we got had a nice texture, it went well with the sauce and wasn't too crunchy. The banh canh (udon) had good noodles, the soup was alright. The bun thit nuong had good grilled pork, but no egg roll and not much variety in vegetables. My hu tieu had super chewy, undercooked noodles and I didn't enjoy the soup at all. I think they had to rush it since everyone else got their food before me. The seafood combo was disappointing for the price it was. The crawfish were tiny and mussels/crab weren't that good.   Overall (3 stars) - This is a fairly new place, so maybe they need just need some time. They had a nice, chill atmosphere and young, but hard working servers. Gave an extra star for that bomb calamari and they had corn in the seafood combo that tasted good with the spicy sauce. They also gave you gloves and little plastic bag bibs if you wanted to avoid a  mess. Kudos for that :)",

The waitress we had was new and wasn't trained I guess. They didn't tell her much about the details and she didn't know the menus that well. The food though is great. I got a bun (vermicelli) with pork and an egg roll. It was great. Also got sweet potato fries, but they didn't have anything for them like honey mustard or glaze. Just ketchup. Its American food at a Vietnamese place, I think it's out of place. I mean that's not that big of a deal but it just seems like they need some more time to get things organized. They where missing small things like splenda and sweet and lo packets at the tables, the honey mustard, and just little stuff. I say in a month they'll be ready. The place has a lot of potential but it's not ready yet.",

I need a table for 5 cuz we tryna eat? Duh.  They ran out of shrimps for my spring rolls . That's like chick-fil-a running out of chicken. Wtf. But that wasn't the only thing they ran out of... basically half the menu they couldn't make because they \"ran out\" which was disappointing because I really wanted a dessert drink. I got the \"flamin banh canh\" which wasn't bad but I wouldn't get it again. Then the waiter told us the kitchen is closing soon so he rushed us to put in the rest of our order (he was young, it was a Friday night, he was tryna leave to party, I get it) but 3 mins til closing someone walked in to put in a to-go order and they accommodated her. Isn't the kitchen closed??   And they still dipping me out on my change! lol I remember at flamin crawfish they would take my change without asking and they still doing it here at flamin kitchen. Smh It wasn't much that they took but I felt like it was extremely rude of them to just take it.   I will try to come back one more time for a dessert drink but other than that, I wouldn't sit down to eat at this establishment again. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte I can go spend my time and money at.",

I normally get pho from Saigon Bay, but having it this close would be so convenient. The restaurant used to be a Five Guys, and I was surprised to find that they had barely changed anything about the appearance of the restaurant to distinguish it from the fast food burger joint. I was leery about the food from the appearance but I decided to give it a try despite my instincts.  I ordered the Pho Ga was very disappointed. The broth had no flavor whatsoever, and I had to use the entire cup of sriracha they gave me to make it worth eating. The chicken meat was a mix of light and dark, and the dark pieces were very veiny and sinewy. I feel like I have wasted my money (despite the low quality, the price was about the same as anywhere else at $11).   Hopefully they step their game up or they're replaced by a Mexican restaurant. This shopping center needs one!",

The sauce was TOO sweet and the medium wasn't spicy at all.  It was missing that Cajun kick!! Knowing I'm picky with sauces, I asked if I could taste it beforehand and was told no, it was made to order. Eh! That should've deterred me.  The crab legs were not cleaned very well and the shrimp were EXTREMELY over cooked which left them mad mushy!  Overall it wasn't horrible, but I don't have to go back any time soon.",

Their bahn mi is a good competition to Le's, which I used to swear by up till now. This changes everything for me because all this while I could only get bahn mi on weekends due to their timings. Also, the crawfish was delicious and very flavorful. I will probably pass on that in the future though, since it's such little meat for so much effort in peeling. Going to try more seafood there.",

Also got an order of pho Togo but didn't come with any hoisen sauce or sriracha. Would be better if it had came with it especially for people who doesn't have any at home. They forgot to pack us veggies as well  when the bags came out but our waitress asked if we wanted any. Our waitress was great btw! Will be back!",

We got the eggrolls to start, and they were very fresh, hot, and crispy.  They give you a healthy portion of warm fish sauce to go with it  (yum!).  I tried the very berry fruit tea, which was delicious.  I like that it was made with crushed ice, and I loved the chunks of berry and jelly.  It was very sweet, and refreshing.   I got the pho ga, and my fiancee got com dac biet.  Both portions were huge.  The broth in the pho was very flavorful, and there was a great amount of white chicken meat.  I do wish there had been more onion slices. I also prefer cilantro on the side, versus basil. My fiancee enjoyed his dish, and commented that it was the biggest portion he has ever seen of that dish.  He also liked the fried tofu and the generous amount of fish sauce that came on the side (he usually has to ask for more.)  The waitress was very pleasant, and very attentive.  We will definitely be back.",

Flavor is good, but not the best in this part of town.  Price is about average, but the volume you get doesn't keep pace with the reigning value king in this department.  I ordered the tripe, tendon, beef ball etc., the beefy grab bag or P1 on the menu.  The brisket was good.  The meatball had a very strong taste but had too much of a potpourri flavor to it for my tastes.  There was only one piece of tendon, the right amount of tripe, and plenty of the other meats.  I will be back to try the vermicelli and probably another item.  They have tons of seafood and I think this is their specialty.  This specialty doesn't make this my go to pho place, so purely on that dimension see some of the places I have 5 stars.  They are fast here, faster than the higher rated places I chronicle.  I will have to flesh out more of the menu, but my preliminary ruling is that this place is fine, good even, but with its superior location I will still be taking the extra ten minutes to go to my favorite place when I need some pho food healing.",

Only thing that could've been better with the bahn mi is a little more meat and extra extra veggies. The meat and veggies barely made it half way on the sandwich. I also ordered the golden milk tea which was good but I wish they would start putting tapioca on the bottom. The place is kind of tight, need some more space but I did like their playlist. Only downfall was that we sat there for 10 minutes needing a drink refill. Needless to say, we will be visiting again!",

    "text": "Re-opening with Flamin' Crawfish at night and Flamin' Kitchen Pho by day. I remember my first time going to Flamin' Crawfish when they were at their old location. I love the MyTeas and you can even get a fruit and milk tea in one now with a split cup.   I'll start off with the Flamin' Banh Canh. I do recommend getting this, since you rarely see many Vietnamese restaurants have Banh Canh on their menu. They broth is very delicious and the crab legs are fun to eat and drenched in broth. I believe it's supposed to come with shrimp patties, which I got none in my broth if I remember correctly. There is TOO MUCH broth however. All you see is liquid and it's like fishing for fish in a steep, murky pond. There is a lot of oil in almost everything though.   On to the seafood! The crawfish was overcooked causing it to be mushy and easily breaks the meat into small pieces. I got the $44.99 special and was notified that there was no blue crab left (which I noticed as a common theme throughout my experience here). The Flamin' special sauce is a little sweet, but once again, a fountain of oil. Maybe get bread to dip in the sauce.   We tried to order Chicken Banh Mi to-go and they were also out of chicken like they were out of blue crab. Does this happen every day? As a foodie, hearing someone tell me they're out of something makes me incredibly sad. I do understand that stuff can run out, especially seafood, but CHICKEN???   The meal ends with these coffee jelly desserts. The coffee flavor is very light and I'm not sure what the liquid is, but I think it's coffee creamer or maybe some kind of sweetened milk. In general, a very innovative idea!   As one of the only seafood broil spots in Charlotte, if some improvements were made, I can guarantee it will be a big hit in the years to come.",

I got the seafood combo 1 which came with 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of clams. We opted for the Flamin Kitchen sauce medium spice. I like the sauce, it's sweet with a good kick of spiciness for us. The clam was good and so was the crawfish. The shrimp on the other hand was over cooked so it was hard to deshell and once you were able to deshell it, the shrimp was tough tasting so my son and boyfriend didn't enjoy it. I had the sweet tea and it's not your normal Louisiana sweet tea, it was like a jasmine sweet tea which some folks aren't used to so they didn't like it but I didn't think it was that bad. We also had the Cajun Fries which came out right away. It was nice and crispy. Helped with the spiciness of the meal. I'd go again just for their Flamin Kitchen sauce but maybe will stay away from the shrimp.",

Service is so so but I go for the outstanding pho and sandwiches that can't be matched anywhere else and not for the service.",

Luckily thanks to this spot I don't have to drive far anymore. The service is great and the pho is delicious. I love eating pho all the time, especially on a rainy day or when I'm sick. The broth is super flavorful also. I'm actually craving some pho as I write this. Try this restaurant out if you love pho and you won't be disappointed.

    "text": "Mama Loan's guide to feed a family of 6 for $40!  I've been battling this annoying cold that I got from my coworker since Tuesday, and you betcha that nothing treats a bad cold better than a hot/steamy bowl of Pho! And if you know me, I eat like a lil bird....small portion at one sitting, but many meals thru-out the day!;) And with  my cold at its peak...Pho is a must for tonite! So, without further ado, allow me to introduce to you our dinner for a family of 6 for $40...seriously, a guaranteed yummilicious dinner   - $4.95 Grilled pork sandwich: Daddy David been craving for Banh mi - $11.95 Banh canh: Ayden and London's fav dish, and it's a big portion, so it's enough for 2 - $5.50 (children's size) x 3 Combination Pho: for mama Loan, grandpa and grandma. We eat light at night, so this is the perfect portion for us. Even though it said it's children size, but it's plentiful, sometimes I couldn't even finish it...I called it the 'LIGHT' portion for those Carbs counters! - $4.75 Che dessert: and of course, sick or not, I'm always in the mood for Che   **Total with tax included: $40.76**  I also loved it how they packaged the food, ready to eat no matter where you are...all the noodles in the bowls, just heat up the broth and pour them over! If you've ever ordered Pho at work, you would understand...they give you noodles and meats in a to-go box and broth in one of those tall, plastic containers. This makes it almost impossible to enjoy a good bowl of Pho at work.....but with this prepackaged bowls, I can now eat pho at work (or anywhere) and still enjoy it almost like I'm at home    So, I don't know about you guys, but if I were to cook dinner instead of eating out, I don't know if I could  get it under $40 while still giving everyone a variety of choices. And not to mention, the time and water wasted cooking/washing the dishes afterward! WINNER DINNER!!!#flaminkitchen",

We had banh mi, bun dac biet dau hu ky tom, crawfish and shrimp. We liked them all. The house sauce that they steam in (Flamin Special) has just the right amount of heat to not overwhelm the flavor of the fresh seafood. The banh mi baguette was crispy and fluffy, just as it should be.  The YELP reviews are kind of mixed, so we were skeptical to give them a try as they might still be working out the new restaurant kinks. We are glad we went and recommend you give it a try. It's a welcome change from the same old places, it's a mom and pop business, and we hope you'll give them a taste. We will be going again without a doubt.",

She gave off an annoyed mood the entire time and never once smiled. Obviously I know not to expect high expectations with waitressing but customer service is very important if you want to keep your customers. Now about the food, the calamari appetizer costed $5-$6 but should honestly be worth $3-$4. There were only 7 pieces and looked half fried. The good thing I'll say is that the crawfish combo #1 was good and the sauces that came with the calamari. But customer service could be better.",

    "text": "Didn't try their Vietnamese dishes so I can't give an opinion on that however I had a array of seafood that I will review here.  The set up is like the other Vietnamese owned Cajun restaurants where the seafood is steamed then doused in the sauce of your choice and served in plastic bags tied at the top so the flavors of the sauce steams into the seafood.  My girlfriends and I shared bags of crawfish, shrimp and crab legs in the Flamin special sauce. I loved It! The sauce is very strong and kind of takes away from the seafood's natural flavor but I like It that way. There's a sweetness in the sauce and a very subtle flavor reminiscent of Thai coconut curry. It was so delicious! I ordered Cajun fries just so I'd have something to dip in the sauce - it's that good!  There are heat levels you can choose ranging from mild to hot. Being Asian, I love spicy heat and throw Thai bird chilies in pretty much every dish I eat. I even have a jar of my mom's home dried and ground Thai bird chilis in my office drawer to add to food while I'm at work. Eating so much peppers so frequently, I like to think I can hang when It comes to spicy peppers. Which is why I ordered hot.  Most places don't have heat levels high enough for me to feel the burn and Vietnamese food isn't really spicy - or at least not as spicy as Thai and Korean dishes.  Boy was I wrong! It's so spicy that my cheeks were a vibrant shade of red, my fingers were sore and I was literally crying tears of heat at the table. I loved It!!! Like I seriously felt euphoric eating the seafood.  I'm giving only 4 stars because as great as the seafood was, the drinks were not good at all. I ordered mango tea with boba and ended up throwing It away. It wasn't sweet and there's a bad kind of bitter aftertaste you get when tea has been steeped too long.  The next time I go, I'll only eat the seafood and save my money for the teas at Tea Fusion instead.",

    "text": "Let's start off by saying that there are a lot of Great Vietnamese restaurants In Charlotte, but in Northern Charlotte Flaming Kitchen is my favorite.  A lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte have limited menu, and I understand it's due to the lack of demand for foods that are to diverse, this makes keeping options difficult for restaurants.  I spent time looking for 1 location that offered it all and this is the closest I've come.  From Vietnamese appetizers to a veritable of soups, desserts and teas it's almost all here.  Authenticity is pretty good and the quality is high and consistently delicious.  Bun boe hue is a hard dish to find but it's here and they do it well, the boba tea is also pretty good and service is always with a smile.  5 stars to this restaurant. Casual and cost isn't to high either for example 5 of us had dinner and apps a couple sodas and it was around $60, of course this is totally based on what you order. Hope this helps and hope you enjoy the food as much as I have!",

    "text": "I've only been here for the Pho, but once I get on a Pho bender I'm set in my ways. I could eat it for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Bottle the stuff, I'll come runnin' to buy it!  So I'll admit, I'm real keen on the 'other' Pho guys closer to W.T. Harris and Tryon. I've been generously visiting 'em for nearly a decade. So to give another place a try was challenging. It seems like a lot of places are offering the dish now and I hate it when it just becomes another thing that's thrown on the menu with little thought or respect for the process. Flamin Kitchen has Pho right on the front of the building, gotta be good right?  Ordering to-go, still got a sick girlfriend at home and the power of Pho can make anyone feel better. There isn't much to the dining area, but clean and bright. Nice, friendly hostess got me my food (which was ready 5 minutes early!) and I was off.  First off, lets talk about a quick technical detail: They give you a tall container with the pho broth and a soup bowl style container with the meats and noodles separately. I love the fact that this bowl is big enough for all of the broth! You would think it's a no brainer, but I've been to restaurants where I guess they assume you'll place everything in your own bowl. Not only does this dramatically cool down the food by putting it in a new vessel, but you're going to spill broth, no doubt! A nice touch for sure.  Pho itself, was borderline divine. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT forget to add the sriracha and the hoisin sauce! Rare beef sliced thin and flank steak had awesome texture. The beef meatballs, firm and savory. I'm a real fan of the tripe and tendon, you're missing out if you forego these yummy morsels. The broth had this fragrance that if the lid wasn't airtight, you'd pull over on the way home to drink it. Great onion and beef body with subtle licorice notes from star anise and a great pungency from the ginger. The sriracha rounds everything out so nicely, please don't skimp out on this!  They've got a whole menu to explore and judging from the broth, they know what they're doing! From Crawfish Boil to Bahn Mi to Viet-style smoothies and teas, I'm a believer and they've successfully broken me free from my one-pho ways!",

I ordered the Shrimp Pho and my only complaint is that the shrimp still has the tails on it but other than that the broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. It was a pretty big serving too because I thought I ate half of it and I almost filled up the togo container, yes to dinner! I also ordered the spring rolls that were a good size with lots of fresh flavor.  The service was fast and friendly. There was only one young lady working and even with 6-7 tables she didn't miss a beat. There was a gentleman as well helping her bring out food but other than that she was taking care of everything.  Can't wait to come back to try a seafood boil!",

I went with the crawfish and they were quite good. Extremely salty, though. The only thing that got me was the fact that both my other and I found a number of females full of roe which completely ruined the taste. Some may consider a delicacy but l am not a fan at all. I've had a lot of crawfish in my day and this is the first time I've experienced finding roe. The service was good and the wait time for our food was short. I also got the noodle dish with the crab lumps but I cannot recall the name of the dish. It was quite good and had great flavor. Overall I was happy with my experience and will return.",

They did not understand when I wanted only garlic butter and put Cajun spices in Everything!! They said they ran out of the garlic butter broth.  When we complained, nothing. They literally did not care or ask how they could fix it. If I could give zero stars I would. One third of the muscles were empty. Definitely not worth the money.

    "text": "WELCOME BACK!!! How do I contain my excitement in writing this review.. okay I won't. I was SO OBSESSED with Flamin' when they were at their first location by Montford. They had to close that location and I've been yearning for them to come back ever since. Finally.. HERE WE ARE! I believe they've been open for less than a month now and I've been 3 times, possibly 4. If they were closer to me, it would probably be most of the week. I will organize this review based on types of food and my recommendations! Let's go!  Seafood Boils (Crawfish, Crab (Blue, Snow, and Dungeness), Mussels, Shrimp, Clams and Lobster): My FAVORITE part is definitely the seafood boils. Step one is pick your preferred seafood. They are priced by the pound (MP). Decide how many pounds you want, then choose the flavor and level of spiciness! I alternate between crawfish or shrimp, but I always the Flamin' Special flavor, Hot on the spicy level and a side of rice to eat with the sauce. It's amazing! I've also tried the Garlic Butter flavor and it's delicious.   Soups: I haven't had the chance to try their pho yet, but I have tried a couple of their soups. My favorite is the Banh Canh. I would also recommend the Canh Bun. Both are traditional Vietnamese soups and they do a good job with both.   Fruit Teas & Dessert: They have a wide variety of fruit teas with bits of jelly and fruits throughout the drink. All very delicious and also very refreshing! My favorite is the Passion Love and Mango Madness. They also offer milk teas and dessert drinks. The dessert drinks are traditional Vietnamese desserts (also known as che). My favorite is the Che Thap Cam which has red tapioca, grass jelly, pandan jelly and coconut milk. YUM!  A couple of kinks: slow service and a long wait on food. They did just open a month ago and have a huge influx of people that come through, so it's understandable, but I believe I waited 45 minutes last time for food after ordering. They do run out of various things throughout the week, but I'm giving them time to adjust. I believe in you and naturally, I'll be back!",

I came with a side plate with beansprouts, some basil leaves and some jalapeno slices.  Being a big fan of jalapenos, I dropped 3 slices in my pho.  It was, without a doubt, the hottest jalapeno I have ever eaten.  Being follicly challenged, sweat was pouring out of every pore on my head.  I picked the other 2 slices out of my pho.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, but I suggest taking a tiny bite of the jalapeno befor popping an entire slice into your mouth.",

The banh mi was pretty big. They weren't stingy with all the meat and veggies which is great. It was super filling but I think it's partially because the bread is a little bit bigger than usual. The calamari was actually pretty delicious. However it was pretty much all stuck together so you had to tear them apart from each other. The sauce that comes with it adds a perfect touch.   The MyTEA and the che trai cay came with a lot of ice. Every time I tried to take a sip out of the cup or even eat some of I would end up tasting the ice and not the actual dessert. I literally took all the ice out of my che and that took about a third of the cup. For the MyTea It took almost a third of that as well. If I were you I would recommend less ice just to have it cool and refreshing and at the same time get the most out of them.   Right now they have a promotion if you eat the pho or the banh mi you also get a free soft drink.",
