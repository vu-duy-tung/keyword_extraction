We ate a few bites, especially enjoying the kale chips and the mac and cheese (surprisingly since we are rare to find a good mac and cheese).  We also appreciated the wine selection on top of the cocktail choices.  Our server was attentive despite the crowd and the GM offered us a nice greeting.  Most of all, the setting is outstanding, inside and out.  The views are great but the decor really offers a lot and makes us say (sorry but it's still True), we don't even feel like we're in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Show up in a suit right after work and you're good to go. You'll pay an extra $3-5 per drink, but it's a very nice rooftop bar with a beautiful view. Better than Fahrenheit and City Lights Social in my opinion. The staff was friendly the first time I went, but a little pretentious the second time around.  My second visit didn't go so well. We showed up in dress shoes, slacks, sweaters, and light jackets and were turned away at 9pm on a Friday. Apparently there is a \"strict collared shirts\" policy, even though it was 45 degrees in late November (and it's a rooftop bar exposed to the elements). Also, the social program manager is someone I know from his days at Hotel Van Zandt / Geraldine's in Austin, having lived there for five years, and he was completely unwilling to accommodate us because of the lack of \"collared shirts\". A hotel guest was refused immediately after us because he was wearing sneakers. I don't know this guy, but he was paying a premium to stay at a Kimpton boutique hotel and couldn't even get a drink at the hotel bar. I've never seen such a thing anywhere else, and I travel 2-3 weeks per month for work. \"Sorry you didn't pack dress shoes\" was the bouncer's way of addressing that situation, and it's pretty much on par for the greeting you should expect at Merchant and Trade. Reminds me of that movie Date Night - Claw, you're welcome!",

Then we decided to go outside and everything changed. This thin blonde server, I am unaware of her name because she was so rude, she was the worst server we have ever had. We're both former workers of the hospitality industry and could not believe this girl. We had to wave her over to order a drink, and she asked so rudely what my husband wanted  - as if it was annoying to her that we were asking. Then she got the drink and slammed it on the table and ran away. I really couldn't believe in a upper scale type of environment that a server was acting like this. If you hate your life when assisting people with their food and drink, do something else! So thanks Kate for your service, along with the good drinks and ambiance of the place we will be back. But we will make sure to steer clear of the other server, as their job is important to provide a good experience.",

They use some ambiguous \"no sporty shoe\" policy to randomly select who actually gets the privilege to get inside. I see them turn away people with great non-sporty shoes and I've seen others in there with nikes. It makes no sense and makes me wonder if they are being bribed or discriminating. Anyway, waiting in this line is like playing roulette. If you are allows to enter, the food is poor....just a greasy, salty overpriced mistake. We ordered a bunch of dishes and nothing was remotely good. The view was nice, but pretty much any rooftop bar has one. Drinks are fine, but who can't make a good cocktail in 2018?....and of course, they are overpriced. I say...respect yourself and save your money. Avoid this place like the plague.",

Stepping into the elevator to make the journey up to the rooftop's reveal is worth the wait! Great drinks, class and elegance also mix style and sexiness. Finally a big city vibe so needed in Charlotte. I travel everywhere for work, and I make it a point to at least visit a Kimpton property when I am in a different city. Charlotte, you are lucky to have this company in your town. It is obvious from the minute that you walk into a Kimpton property, customer service and a sense of pride is always present. You definitely set the bar high for future properties in the Queen City!!",

When we finally got up the elevator to our seats, it took a good 15 minutes to even be noticed by a server. My girlfriend ordered a martini that was less than two ounces and costed $14 and honestly just tasted like pineapple juice. I ordered the fried chicken sauce trio and my girlfriend ordered the coffee rubbed steak with potato strings. Our food arrived within an acceptable amount of time, but my fried chicken came in a basket (?) with zero sides and zero sauces. And to add to that monstrosity, the chicken was raw in the inside. My girlfriends steak tasted decent but was smaller than a iPhone and the potato strings were burnt. The bill came out to be about $75 for drinks and subpar food. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars is because the ambiance is really cool.",

Once escorted up to the 19th floor of the hotel, the doors opened to a well-decorated bar and indoor/outdoor seating area. As far as rooftop bar decor goes, I think Merchant & Trade slays the other options in Charlotte. They've used a navy and green theme to give it a vibrant feel while providing an overall relaxed environment. Seating options include rocking chairs, coaches, benches, stools, and everything in-between. The view is GREAT, especially if you want to watch a Knights game while drinking overpriced cocktails instead of overpriced beer (oh wait, they have that too!).  The drink and food menu were pretty average compared to its peer institutions. I'd been really hoping for a knockout cocktail menu, but they only had a handful of options, none of which sounded appealing to either my guy or me (and we have pretty different palates). The wine menu is okay, and they've got a good selection of liquors. Like many other uptown locales, you can buy a local craft brew for twice as much as you'll pay for it at the brewery its made at.  The food menu had some promise, and I hope they'll expand it. There were only a handful of appetizers, a few larger dishes, and a couple desserts. The lavash we had was really good, but I would've loved to get something more substantial here. Their vegetarian options were lacking, which is why I hope they'll start offering more selections.  Definitely worth one trip for the view and ambiance. I think it would make a great first date locale!",

The physical space is wonderful, it's unfortunate they ruin it with a sense of undeserved importance and exclusiveness bordering on discrimination. If you're looking for a Charlotte rooftop bar with more hospitable and friendly staff, check out Nuvole. Or, if you  can forgo the rooftop views, Angelines is at the base of the same building as Mercenaries & Tyrants and infinitely more hospitable.",

The dj played a mix of house and techno music that wasn't obnoxious. With all of those glows, I'm giving M&T three stars because the table service was sub par. Our waitress was mediocre at best. She came off as cold and inattentive. I don't know if there were special cocktails because we were just handed the menu and she walked off. They carry a wide variety of spirits and the prices are about the same at similar venues. I will return to M&T and hopefully I'll be seated in a section with a friendlier waitress.",

The inside is small and cozy which is perfect for social interaction.   After being sat, our waitress greeted us and gave drink suggestions she was very helpful and polite.

    "text": "We went to Merchant & Trade after the Carolina/Baltimore game and we were staying at the Kimpton. I don't know if it is usually that crazy busy after a home game, but if it is I suggest more staff for the occasions. Elia, behind the bar was a complete sweetheart. You could tell she was very stressed being by herself and the customers she was dealing with did not help her situation. For the extremely long wait, she was able to comp our first round of drinks. The General Manager was also very kind and I saw him helping her out, however there was someone else, a bar back perhaps, named Taylor? He was very rude to our bartender and should not be talking like that to his fellow employees in front of guests where they can overhear his major attitude problem. It was a major turnoff and not a professional look for somewhere that is striving to be in a luxury market.",

The service from the moment you get into the elevator up to the main lobby is excellent, greeted with a smile and everyone looked very poised yet fun. Now for the good stuff, the food and drinks were fantastic. The blushing bell cocktail is so good I came back the next day for another drink. The food is also delicious, presented just as beautiful as the drinks. Would recommend going here for a special night in Charlotte.",

First, we had to be in line for almost 1 hr to get in ( we thought the place was packed inside) when we finally went up , turns out the place was nearly empty, so what's the hold up ? Probably trying to make you feel like it's packed so they can attract more people to go to this place  Second , the drinks are horrible , if you're looking a  good mixeologist, go somewhere else  Third, not only they made us wait in line for an hour and the place was nearly empty but all the Firepits were off ! What kind of place makes you do all that for S** experience ?? I had to apologize to my friends and say , sorry - this is just Charlotte and they think they are Miami or something.   Out of all the loungues in 202 world wide cities I've been to, this is rank # 202",

We were wearing casual brewery clothes (think flannels, etc) and they let us in around 4pm. Based on other reviews they probably would not have let us in at a later hour. We were seated right away and I love the ambiance and the decorations. Very classy and well put together. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We ordered cocktails and I ordered tater tots. The cocktails were very good, but the tots might have changed my life. They were huge and hand made and gourmet and yum. I really want to come back here after work dressed up and enjoy properly after dark. My guests loved the views. I only remove one star because the doorman was a little much for 4pm on a Saturday. Will definitely come back and I also can't wait to try Angeline's.",

Did I mention the line to get in ... it's absolutely crazy and once you get in you have to wait again to get food service( 45 mins to get in plus another 30 to order) . The wait staff wasn't that all to friendly either, maybe I just went on a bad night , however I did not enjoy my experience there.",

    "text": "Merchant & Trade nailed it here! I've frequented Kimpton Hotels and their luxurious spaces when visiting D.C so my expectations were already high. Until visiting M&T, The Donovan's Rooftop was my favorite, the pool, the view and the service was all just spot on. Upon entry Brandon greeted me at the door and wished us a great evening, once upstairs the music was alive and the drinks were flowing. You immediately get greeted off the elevator and taken back by how large the space actually is. The \"grassy\" dance floor with the DJ booth, the sections, THE VIEW! It appeared there was a nook for whatever type of experience you wanted. Seated, standing, dancing, grouped together with friends, or just solo and taking in the view. I love the energy from staff and Kate assisted me all evening with drinks. Some beers are a bit pricier here than at other venues but you're paying for an experience, a view and class. This isn't a dive bar, bring your best threads and some spending money. Treat yourself, you deserve it.   I will say this place could benefit with a mobile bar maybe near the DJ booth. If you don't have a waiter or waitress then you'll be waiting at the bar for some time. Just a small bar that has beers ready to go especially as this place gets busier this summer.   Outside of that, great work. A little jealous I'll prolly never experience the hotel part since I actually LIVE in Charlotte and LOVE Kimpton but happy to have M&T when friends visit. Maybe I'll get to do a staycation one day. All in all, two thumbs up here.",

We were really impressed with the layout of everything in the restaurant, and even though it was cloudy, and cold outside it was still a great view. The bartenders greeted us as soon as we sat down, and were really prompt in answering our questions. They told us the drink menu changes almost quarterly, and even though it had just changed, they were very knowledgeable about the drinks and made great recommendations. My wife had the Nakatomi tower and I had the Bananarama. Both were exceptional, we will most definitely be back before the drink menu changes.",

The first time we went the bouncer warned my significant other that his brand new converse were not strictly dress code and he would let him in this time but next time he might not get in. We went around 2pm on a Saturday so I assumed they let him in because it wasn't busy and he was wearing a suit jacket. The next time we went was at night and we got fancy dressed up but saw several people not dressed to impress (including cut off shorts with threads hanging loose). A dress code is one thing but it seems like it is haphazardly enforced at best.   When we went in the afternoon we sat at the bar and admired the beautiful views while the bartender mixed delightful cocktails. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable and recommended drinks that were to our taste. The beet it was my favorite and a $1 from each drink was advertised as going to charity. All in it was a lovely afternoon with an impressive view.   At night we were shuffled to a small table that had zero air flow. Air flow is essential to sitting outside in the summer in NC and our water glasses were empty most of the time. Drinks took forever as well. Not a huge deal because it was busy and we were waiting on a group of friends anyway. After we had been there about an hour and had two drinks a new waitress dropped off our check and told us our waitress had gone home and could we please close out. We left the check and a card on the table for over 30 minutes waiting on someone to pick it up when our friends arrived. We grabbed the check and the card to go say hi figuring we would close out at the bar because we would have to go there for our next round of drinks anyway. Almost immediately our original waitress materialized demanding we close out! And I noticed she was there until closing so I would have assumed they wanted our table, except it sat empty the rest of the night. Strange.  TD:DR - lovely first experience in the afternoon. Not a great vibe on the second nighttime visit.",

The dress code on their website specifically says \"high-end, clean sneakers are allowed, provided they are complimented by appropriate attire\". I was wearing brand new, very clean, all white sneakers. On my phone I showed him the dress code posted right on their own website and he still sent us away. We ended up having a great time at a different rooftop bar down the street. M&T should communicate their dress code with their staff and patrons more clearly, or better yet, just say \"no sneakers\" in their posted dress code so others don't get sent away for the same reason.",

Entertaining out of towners on a weekday night, I decided to give M&T a try after seeing it pop up on my Yelp feed. I went with a group of four on a Thursday night. We were seated right away around 8:00 ish in a dimly lit open room with thumping music that wasn't overpowering. We didn't have to scream to have a conversation. The waitress was over immediately and took our drink orders. We had a blueberry cider, as I'm not a beer drinker that was delicious. Good pour, $7. The waitress made great recommendations and we had kale chips, wings, and the lobster rolls. Kale chips ($9) melted in my mouth. Very airy, as all decent kale chips are. Wings were a little suspect, as I've never seen a wing shaped like a ball at the end of a bone, but they were decent. I would not get the wings in the future. Last were the lobster rolls. I was expecting a lobster egg roll, but the mini sandwiches were GREAT. We shared, so I only had one. The dish came with two rolls ($17 A little steep), but they were fresh and I had no regrets except that I couldn't keep it all to myself.  The best part of Merchant and Trade was the atmosphere. They did a great job with decor and the crowd was 30+ which is nice. Very sexy vibe and you can make it a date night, or come with friends to hang out. There were plenty of post work groups. Long story short, I'll be returning to Merchant & Trade soon.",

I've read the reviews about fake lines, so we just walked by. Instead our group spend a collect several hundred dollars at Belfast / Cotton Room, which is great btw.  Around 11:30 there was no line here so we tried to come back again. AFTER checking everyone's IDs they told us we couldn't go up because one person in our party was wearing \"athletic shoes.\" Funny thing was, we were all dressed really nice. We'd been to a nice dinner at Malabar. He and his gf has been to Blumenthal for a show. Apparently he was dressed nice enough for Blumenthal but not for a cheesy hotel bar. Skip it, just skip this place entirely. We then went to 204 North which is great also and spent several hundred dollars there sipping craft drinks and single barrel bourbons. This place missed out on probably $500 in sales from our one party. They don't want your money.",

    "text": "So I decided to give Merchant and Trade another try after my first experience, which was not good. I had several friends and family members in town for my wedding a few weeks ago so we decided to meet there for drinks.   Pros - drinks were great, atmosphere was upbeat and fun.   Cons - inconsistent billing practices. One group had their card charged for their full bill mid visit. When they asked the waitress why she informed them that they needed \"to confirm there were funds available, as they've had people not cover their bills\". This would be ok, if it happened to everyone there, let alone our party. But it did not. In fact, no one else in our party was treated the same.   Overall, I think this is an ok place. Good concept, fun drinks (though a little pricey). However, as with several places in Charlotte, I think they struggle with diversity and handling large groups of diverse people. I recognize this is a strong statement, and refrained from including it in my first review (although I felt the same after that visit). However, we were a very diverse group of people (mostly of color) and had a very different experience than our non-diverse guests. It's unfortunate given the diversity Charlotte is seeing, and will continue to see. Businesses should work to ensure all guests experiences are consistent, regardless of background/makeup.   That said, if you're looking for a nice rooftop vibe and good drinks Merchant and Trade will deliver. Unfortunately, I don't plan to be back or to host another group there in the near future. I'm not a fan of inconsistency.",

When we first arrived, there was a line; which I've heard they intentionally do this to create a fake demand. Finding this ridiculous nonsense, we went around the corner to Belfast Mill (I highly recommend this bar if you ever have a chance) where each of us had 2-3 drinks. Deciding at this point to grab one more drink before calling it a night, we decided to try Merchant & Trade one more time. There was no line so we went into the building. Security checked my ID but then decided to turn us away because our friends who had been to the show were wearing \"athletic shoes\". It should be noted that we all were dressed to have had dinner at a very nice restaurant and gone to a show at Blumenthal, so we took our money to a different bar where we bought 2-3 more cocktails.",

A month later attempted with slacks and shoes and was told I couldn't go up (after waiting 35 min on a line) because I had on a sweater and not a collared shirt even though it was the middle of December. I told myself that I wouldn't go back but 2 weeks ago after a wedding I was invited so I went. Surely, I was good to go since I had on a suit. The line was 45 min long and had about 20 people on it which is ridiculous. I saw a buddy of my walk straight up to the bouncer with two women and had a small conversation and was let up in 5 min. I asked and the bouncer said they stayed at the hotel, not knowing that I knew the guy. Once upstairs my buddy said he wasn't staying there that the bouncer knew one of the ladies so he let them up!!! There was also a guy on line with a hooded sweater and Gucci sneakers on so in my head I knew he wouldn't get upstairs. About 15 mins after I got up I saw the guy at the bar!!! WTF if you are going to attempt to have a dress code and make people wait at least an hour to get upstairs be consistent. We got a table and ordered food and the waitress came back after taking our order and said they just closed the kitchen less than 5 min ago so they couldn't accommodate our order. The only thing that was good was the view and the cool bartender Henry that made bad ass drinks. Third times a charm and they failed. I won't be back!!!",

Nice music and atmosphere was wonderful. Variety of seating options, although it was unclear if the tables are reserved or first come first serve? You can see right into the baseball stadium and watch the home game fireworks! The crowd was 30s+ and on the older side which was nice. It was certainly loud with a DJ, but everyone was fairly in control and respectful. Will be back!",

And the bartenders are super friendly and wants to make sure you're taken care of. The elevator that will take you up to the lounge is pretty amazing.   Cons: The crowd that can be found there can be very pretentious and their going to block the bar off just to chat with their friends so prepare to speak up cut through them. Food was pricey and definitely not worth the cost.   Overall: I go there when I feel like dressing up to enjoy a cocktail and people watch. Service is good there and so are their cocktails.",

    "text": "This place provides beautiful views a thousand times over... perfect for pictures! If you're visiting and see a line under the Merchant & Trade don't worry, it goes semi-fast. However, I believe the method of getting people upstairs could be improved, as the number of groups going up at once wasn't based on an actual count and the actual indoor space doesn't provide much standing room, so capacity may become an issue as it gets warmer. Also, dress code is enforced so athletic outfits, shoes and baseball caps will more than likely get you turned around.   Nonetheless, the ambiance was beautiful and rewarding after a long day. The tables are reserved for those that actually request them, so be sure to check with the hostess if you would like to get a table. After getting to the bar, the bartender was friendly and let me know that I would taken care of shortly. I ordered an Apple Eclipse($14) and it was good and came with a kick. But I will say, be mindful of keeping a tab open or ordering multiple drinks. Two drinks cost $30, without food.  Overall, I look forward to visiting this place again for another girls night out! Hope to see my fellow Yelp people there!",

I will say I was thoroughly impressed with how chilled my cocktail was. It feels funny to even write this but it really stood out to me! We also ordered their trio of ice cream/sorbets which was fantastic. I agree with other posters that there was a mixed crowd of people on a weeknight, the dress code is enforced and there's no shade so if it's midday you will be roasting.",

    "text": "Most recently I came to M & T for drinks with girl friends after dinner. Fortunately, when we arrived there was only a very short line. We were a group of 7 and they split us into 2 groups to get on the elevator - which was a little weird, but ultimately not a big deal.   When you walk out of the elevator, you land in a lobby area and have to walk through a door way into the restaurant/bar/lounge.   I love all the light that filters through the very posh space. The space is rectangle shaped so not very deep, but elongated. There was a very large bar towards the back, bench seating along the wall and lounge spaces and tables throughout.   The real reason people come to M & T is for the view! They have a great outdoor space that expands along the entire space. There are high top tables, lounge sofas and chairs ... and many opportunities to selfie... believe me, I saw about 15 girls taking selfies every 5 minutes.   It's a mixed crowd here, young and old. We saw a table of bloggers and parents out to date night. We were there at like 9pm so it was still early.   The drinks were great! I order the same drink everywhere I go (Tito's + soda + lots of lime) sometimes where I ask for lots of lime the bartender doesn't really get the memo - so I have to ask for more. The sweet bartender mentioned she drinks it the same way and made sure I had plenty before handing me my cocktail. One of my girl friends ordered the beat it - it was actually fantastic. Made with Deep Eddy's and Lenny Boy Elite Beet kamboucha. It tasted like the kamboucha but with a little kick.   Living in NYC for some time ... this place is one of the few places that totally reminds me of the city.",

Earlier during the afternoon I had called up to make reservations and we were told that it's first come basis. Reached the place ... the first entrance looks if you are in proper attire ( no shorts or flip flops ) and then another person checks your ID and 3rd person then escorts you to elevator. We were good till now . Once we reached the Restaurant we asked if we could get reservations and were told that it was a wait if 1 hr . We got our name on waiting list hoping that we would have a table by 900 pm . As we started moving around the place I found empty tables with sign \" Gorgeous.. I am taken\" . On enquiring I found that these were reserved ... reserved for whom ... we were told that it was first come first serve basis. On talking with resturant folks they said they take reservations for 5 or more ..well we were 12 ....and what was issue .  Anyway we were given a temporary table till 9:00 and then we had to figure out. So I went in front to find as where I was in waitlist .. found out that our name was removed because we were given a temporary table ..at this point we had enough ..paid for our drinks ...and then moved to Essex.  Good part of this place is Great city view from top.",

    "text": "My husband and I stumbled upon the entrance to Merchant & Trade last night while walking around Uptown.   When you walk in, you are immediately escorted to an elevator that is a straight ride to the top. When we got up there, we went to the bar for a drink. The inside space is super open with glass windows all around. My husband and I both settled on the M&T Old Fashion. Very delish and well made! The drink menu had a handful of fun cocktails, beer, and wine.  I noticed that alot of tables outside had a reserved sign. Since we were only going to be there for 20 minutes as we had tickets for a show, I asked the hostess if we could sit at one. She quickly and sweetly showed me which table we could grab for a bit.   Impressive is the first word that comes to mind when walking outside. Loads of beautiful couches, tables, chairs, and fire pits overlooking a great view of Uptown!!! The ambiance was relaxing but with a classy twist.  We didnt try any food or look at the food menu so I cannot comment on that. Next time we go, we will grab a small bite with our drinks and I'll update the review.  Nice job M&T and welcome to Uptown!",

They are pretty sticklers with the dress code, so be sure to call before going and check your attire our you might get turned away.  I am so surprised to see *at time of writing this* just 3 stars for M&T. This venue is elevated, upscale, and as many have mentioned before, serve great cocktails with an amazing view.  I haven't experienced slow service here.  One particular welcomed feature of Merchant & Trade is that they don't serve $15 cocktails in a plastic glass because you're on a roof. Instead you are handed a crystal-like actual glass to enjoy your adult beverage. I'm over the age of being on a rooftop to drink bubbles out of a plastic flute. Please. Even at the W in DC overlooking the White House. No thanks.",

The whole city of Charlotte was pretty quiet and empty. We noticed a line late Friday night. I think the staff at the hotel informed us that Kimpton customers go through a different line. Not 100% sure, but when we arrived around 7pm there was no line whatsoever. The doormen greeted us and directed us to the elevator.  We did not experience any issues with the dress code. We looked up M&T prior to going and read about the dress code. We also checked with the front desk to make sure jeans were allowed. They informed us that \"nice\" jeans (meaning no logos, rips, etc) were fine. I wore a dress and booties and my SO wore \"nice\" jeans, a dress shirt, jacket, and dress shoes.   Located on the 19th floor of the hotel, M&T has an amazing view of Charlotte. We did not stay long because we had dinner reservations for 8:30 elsewhere. We stayed for a few drinks and enough time to take in the view. The doormen, hostesses, bartenders and the rest of the staff were all enthusiastic and helpful from start to finish. All were happy to take our picture for us... which should be expected if you work at a rooftop bar. Lol. We enjoyed the drinks and outdoor seating areas. The drinks cost a little bit more than your average bar, but nothing outrageous. We look forward to returning and trying their food.",

We ordered drinks and an appetizer. The French Martini was a hit! We ordered a couple of those in addition to the Blue Crab rolls.... they were good! The ambiance was chic and it was a great view of the city. You can see directly inside the baseball stadium and Romeare(sp) Park. There actually happened to be a baseball game going on while we were there and The Charlotte Knights (I think that's our baseball team's name lol) won, therefore we got a chance to see the fireworks (apparently whether we lose or not they still put on a fireworks display--- pretty cool). Oh and despite the long line we stood in to get in, overall we had a great time!  Lastly, I want to point out that the main reason I rated this experience a 5 is the service I received right from the beginning. As we were standing in line, I had to run to the ladies room, so I entered the hotel entry and was pleasantly greeted by some amazing individuals at the front desk: Tommie/Tommy and Dexter. Oh my goodness, when I tell you their spirit, their customer service, and their Amazing attitude was on 1,000.... all I can say is that I'll be back to this hotel to not only see them - Ha! But to stay a night and enjoy the rooftop. Customer service is hard to come by and it was so natural for them! Thanks fellas ---- you rock! Y'all need to be managers!!!! Y'all are much appreciated!",

They did not care, and were extremely unprofessional to me and my girlfriend.

Our friend wasn't allowed in because of the dress code (he was wearing sneakers) so we quickly chugged our drinks and left. Make sure you look up and follow the dress code so this doesn't happen to you!",

    "text": "Ugh. I so badly want to love Merchant & Trade. I have been a handful of times now for drinks and visited again last night with two girlfriends for drinks and appetizers. When the weather is nice outside like it has been lately, it's tough to find a better place in Charlotte to grab a drink outside. The views really are gorgeous and they did a very nice job with the design of both the inside and outside. It has a very upscale lounge vibe and keep in mind that the dress code is strictly enforced. Also be prepared for lines to get in if you are going during peak hours.   The service yesterday was not good at all. To me, It appears that they are very understaffed. Our waitress was really kind but she didn't have the time to do check backs (drinks also took forever) or refill our waters, etc. We waited with empty water and drink glasses for a very long time. With that being said, our margaritas were delicious and I was pleased to hear that they don't use sweet and sour mix (only lime juice and club soda).   The real disappointment of our visit yesterday was our meat and cheese board (see photo attached). They charge $12/person for any meat and cheese board order, which in theory I think is great. Unfortunately, ours came out and it was TINY. There were three of us and no way was it $36 worth of food...like 10 nuts total, very small portions of three cheeses and about 5 crackers in total. Big big bummer. I asked the waitress right away if it was right for three people and she said she would ask the kitchen but never got back to us. It wasn't even worth disputing at time of payment because it had already taken a long time to get our checks.   Overall, gorgeous space but I would expect excellent service given the high prices.",

    "text": "Merchant and Trade (located in/on top/entrance next to) the Kimpton Hotel in Uptown Charlotte is probably one of, if not the bougiest rooftop/bars in all of Uptown.  There is some what of a \"dress code\" so I wouldn't come here in sweats.  There is an outdoor area for nice weather as well as a large inside area when its cold or rainy.  I've been here a couple times now and have had decent experiences both times.  The last time around, we had a waitress that didn't really seem to know her drinks very well, but all good.  What people come here for is really the ambience - great for dates, after parties, work gatherings, etc.  The crowd is low key and usually professional from what I've encountered.  Drinks are decently priced and are on average for a swanky bar.  Their cocktails are also pretty tasty, specifically the Typhoon, which is made with mezcal if that is your thing.    I haven't really had the food here since I've only been past 11pm, but the cake pops were pretty good as a dessert.  Great alternative to the \"meh\" bar scene in Uptown, especially if you are a traveler like me.",

Note that they have a dress code so leave those sweatpants at home! Upon arriving, we were shown to a beautiful elevator plated in mirrors. A short while later, we emerged on the rooftop lounge where were we greeted by a friendly hostess and seated. The lawn furniture was comfortable with a classy twist. We also had a great view of the city since we were seated by the edge.  The drink menu was straightforward and on the higher end (~$15 a cocktail). When we arrived at 7:30p on a Monday, we were informed that they had ran out of some ingredients which limited our choices.   I ordered the Mai Tai after my first choice was unavailable. It took a little while for the drinks to arrive but nothing too concerning. The drink was tasty, but at the price tag, I stopped at one.  Overall a good spot if you want to feel fancy but prepare to lighten your wallet a little. That being said, I could see it as an excellent post-work hang out!",

Unfortunately the food was very disappointing and the service was pretty horrible. My friend's steak was over done and the center of my lamb meatballs was also cold. The bill cannot be split more than three ways and the servers intentionally avoided us multiple times. The drinks however, were surprisingly good and the view was also pretty decent at the patio. Overall I would recommend that you go there for drinks and for a place to hang out but don't go there if you are expecting to have a good meal. The food is not worth the price.",

Two, the seating rules are silly. The hostess told us to sit anywhere in the bar and someone will serve you. However the waitress said we have to ASK the hostess to get someone to serve us. When I go to the hostess she doesn't ask what we want to do, dine in or drink, she just says if you want a drink you can't sit where you are. Starts another explanation and I just walked away as I don't have time.   Third. I just can't get over how effin hot it is in here. My entire being is on pure fire.   Other things to note.

We had the sliders, the blue crab rolls, and the tacos. The sliders were next level, but they are quite pricey 3 for $15. They are pretty small as well.

The drinks are good and they are about as pricey expected for a place like this, but this is a great place to check out and relax at on a nice night.  The servers were very nice and accommodating as well.  The only downside is this place seems to be very popular, and with the hotel crowd, it seems to get crowded quick.

UPDATE to prior review: I was invited back for a \"do over\" by the manager who replied to my earlier post. I came back and had reserved seating, the drinks were 10x better, and the appetizers were delicious. Our waitress was as sweet as pie and very attentive.

The service was so so slow, which I would have understood if they were swamped or if we all had our own tabs, however we were all on 1 tab and the bar was only half full. They gave us 1 server for our huge group, and this was not sufficient at all. Our server worked hard and did the best she could. However they lost a lot of possible sales to us because we couldn't order as many drinks as we wanted with just the 1 server (and yes we asked for more servers, but they could help us).  Even after we got drink orders in, it took more than 30 minutes for them to come out. We also ordered a few apps and they were average at best. The fried mushrooms were soggy and lacked flavor. The duck steak buns were mehhh. The lobster corn dogs were cold.   Overall, the view is great. Come for the view, pictures, and 1 overpriced drink.",

For food there are more tapas and light fare options than traditional entrees and though they all look AMAZING but there just aren't enough of them.   I was only here for a cocktail so I can't wait to come back and try the food. There are only 7 cocktails on the menu and they're all as eclectic as the food. I ordered the cyclone and though it was very tasty, for it to be the most expensive item on the cocktail menu at $16, it was a bit too small for my liking.  I was here by myself because I was just killing time however this is a great place for a group of friends to come and hang out. I'm excited for my next time here.",

There's an entrance on Third Street and an elevator that will take you to the rooftop. We were seated right away and chose to stay inside since it was so hot outside. Even though we were inside, it was still hot.   The menu has small plates but they are big enough for a meal. I had the mahi tacos and a coconut something mocktail. There were three tacos. The fish was flakey and well-seasoned. The slaw was okay. I wish there was a slight sweetness to it. But the Chipotle sauce was good. The mocktail was good. Not too sweet and had a kick of basil or something.   Service was good when we first got there. But it was very slow to get food, drinks and our bill. While service was friendly, it was way too slow for a Tuesday night.  After we did go outside to look at the views and we would like to enjoy them when it's cooler outside.",

The line at the door (and sometimes wrapped around outside) can be a bit of a pain. Once you are upstairs, make sure to try their cocktail specials. I personally prefer the happy hour during the week. I am hesitant to return for the late night weekend vibe.   Just last week (July 2019) I had a great happy hour experience.  Everyone was very friendly from the gent that let me up, to the staff when I walked in, to my server. My server was quick to let me know that there were a few drink specials that weren't on the menu and I am SO glad she did! I had a pina colada inspired drink that was not only delicious but it was absolutely beautiful. I drank it way too fast and thought it was best to eat a little something before I continued drinking. I ordered the calamari and it was delicious. I also ended up ordering the meat and cheese board which did not disappoint.   I am so glad I made a very spur of the moment decision to go in again because it drew me to refer my friends to return on another occasion soon.",

Full disclosure; there is an unnecessary line out the door due to \"bouncers\" only letting 3-5 people in the elevator at a time to go up to the roof.   The atmosphere is amazing and they obviously have a great view of the city. The drinks weren't that strong but we had a great time people watching. The food however was horrible. We had the lamb meatballs which were DRY! The fish tacos were bland and the order of fries came with 6 fries.  This place is more of a come enjoy the atmosphere kind of night. I have no intentions on returning to Charlotte anytime soon so It's not likely they I will be returning to M&T.",

We got the hell cat (awesome Black Sea salt rim) and then I didn't see anything immediately jump out at me on the menu so I chatted with Michael the bartender who asked a few of my preferences and then went to work making me a custom drink. I absolutely LOVE when bartenders do this and even more so when the drink is a 10/10 as this one was. Ask for a St. Michael if he's working and you won't be disappointed.",

I visited this rooftop again with my bf and 2 friends the 1st Friday in October. The weather was beautiful, and we arrived at 4:30 pm on the dot. My bf and I wanted to sit outside, but since they were still getting everything set up, we decided to wait inside and order a drink at the inside bar.   I ordered the 'Golden Wolf' and my bf ordered a regular Mojito. I NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ASAP - Justin (who we found out later was the bar back) made our mojito, and it was the BEST tasting mojito I've had since I visited Cabo, Mexico last July. After we had sat outside, I wanted another mojito, and requested our waitress to find him and get it made by him. However, he was nowhere to be found since he wasn't an actual bartender, and it was super disappointing. I settled for someone else to make it, and while it was still good, I could definitely taste the difference. As for the Golden Wolf, the drink was prosecco based but definitely delicious. If I could replace drinking this over mimosas for the rest of my life, I definitely would! We also ordered a side of fries that were pretty expensive - had maybe 15 fries in the bowl (not worth it).   Highly suggest visiting this rooftop in the daytime. I haven't been here at night, but our friends enjoyed the daytime view so much more. And I'm all for day drinking over night drinking anyways! Since this is by far my fave rooftop in the Charlotte (reminds me of home - nyc), I will definitely be back!",

I knew it was rooftop and there was an inside/outside option but when we arrived, I felt as if I was already outside. It was a humid night so the next time I come here I'll be sure that it isn't. We arrived early in the evening to avoid having to wait in a line. While waiting for our table we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar. Two drinks were $35. Our wait for a table wasn't long. We opted to sit outside hoping we'd catch a slight breeze on such a humid night.  I have to say that the outside area was very nice. The overall vibe of this place was so cool, although my thighs were sweating. ANYWAY...we ordered more drinks and a few of the tapas items. By far my favorite was the pimento grilled cheese and I also loved the crab rolls.  I definitely see myself coming back here for more celebratory drinks.  Oh! I don't know how I could've forgotten to mention the heated toilet seats! I only had two drinks, or else I'd likely think that it was just me, but I'm almost certain that toilet seat was very warm and inviting! Lol The women's powder room was actually very nice.",

Him and his wife took us to this super cool rooftop bar that had the best view of the city!  We had drinks and listened to the live music they had playing and then got a table outside where we got to watch the fireworks display from the baseball field across the street after the game ended. It was such a great atmosphere to hang with friends and enjoy the beautiful weather!  I Highly recommend this place if you're in the downtown Charlotte area!  Check it out.",

More of a place to grab a drink. The vibe they go for is very high end which has pros and cons. I see many reviews with complaints of inconsistency of the enforcement of the dress code and I agree with those. They at times enforce a strict sneaker rule and then other times I have seen people in there with sneakers on? They may want to figure that out so people aren't confused and/or angry. Also it seems that lots of seating says \"reserved\" yet you can be there for over an hour without seeing anyone sit there. Overall it's a nice place to go if you want to get outside and see the city but we sometimes can't go due to someone in your group perhaps not being the right footwear.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are new to the Charlotte area and decided to take my Aunt who was visiting to the rooftop bar we had heard so much about (both good & bad). We were seated promptly and the server (I do not have her name) was extremely pleasant and provided recommendations on her favorite dishes & drinks. We each had two drinks over an hour and half. At the couch next to us was three of our coworkers who we later joined after we finished eating and paid our bill. That's when our evening took a turn for the worse. We joined our coworkers where a hostess or cocktail waitress came over immediately saying the table was reserved even though our friends had been occupying the couch for over an hour. She put a sign down on the table and said nothing else nor would answer our questions. Another waitress named Gabby was helping the other party at the other end of the couch and I politely asked her if we could order drinks and she rolled her eyes and walked away which I was in utter shock for the lack of professionalism. When she came back to serve the other part of the couch, I asked again and she took our order very annoyed. When Gabby returned, she told us she could not serve us and we would have to order food first. I was beside myself because it seemed like they just did not want us there since it was apparent from the first second we sat down we were not welcomed by the staff. We were served two drinks in over a three hour period, had already ate, and now were being told we could no longer be served. I was so embarrassed and insulted- I never have been treated with such disrespect before. My aunt treated us to dinner that night and it was a big night out for her.  I felt awful that our experience  did a complete 180 and her night out was ruined. I do not know if it was because my boyfriend was the only guy, if it was my aunts age or what, but something doesn't add up and cutting us off from being served sober seemed to be their answer. I asked to speak to a manager and all he could say was \"I'm sorry\" and there there was lack of interest to make things right - it was very apparent he did not care. I always held Kimpton hotels to a high standard and had great experiences, but I would not recommend Merchant & Trade to anyone especially when you are entertaining out of town guests. When I told friends about the experience, they were not surprised as they had their own personal experiences of how they were treated by the staff. The staff and management are arrogant and their behavior does not align with the upscale lounge experience that they promote. Disappointed in the Kimpton brand.",

    "text": "Merchant & Trade is trying to hard, and is very underwhelming for what you going in expecting. I went with two other girls on a Tuesday evening for some drinks and appetizers. It was a gorgeous night weather wise and we were looking forward to hanging out on a roof top.  It took us about 15 minutes to get from the bottom of the building to Merchant & Trade because the two bouncers that worked there had us \"fake wait\" in a line ACROSS from the elevator, not even next to it....in a section by itself. We were the only people waiting. This was absolutely absurd, not sure what message Merchant & Trade is trying to send by making three girls wait behind a velvet rope on a Tuesday when there is more than plenty of available seating upstairs.  Once we were seated we ordered a few drinks which were very disappointing. I ordered the pineapple vodka cocktail, insanely sweet and anything but smooth. My friend ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese olives which were stale. After that we played it safe and ordered a Tito's with club soda and lime.... the soda water was flat! The appetizers were OK, the tator tots are very interesting but a little mushy in my opinion. I gave two stars for the view, that is def by far the reason to come here. The view is absolutely gorgeous, and they have very modern fire pits outside which compliments the decor of the bar perfectly.  I gave one additional star for the server assistant, Jaquon (sorry if I am spelling wrong?) Jaquon was BY FAR the nicest, most attentive, and most helpful person who works at this entire establishment.",

The ambience is quite nice and the wait staff was very nice and accommodating. The DJ was also on point playing old hip-hop and knew how to mix.  Five stars for the ambience location dj hostess and waitress",

To keep this short, M&T had blocked two of my friends due to the \"sporty\" nature of their loafers (remember, this is Charlotte, the cultural hotbed of the southeast). They were enforcing a dress code expecting 100% of their patrons to be dressed in cocktail attire, as this is what the normal Charlottean looks like on a Thursday night.   Once we made it past the bouncers, the bar itself was underwhelming, close to empty, and took forever to make overpriced drinks and undercooked food.   If you want to spend a nice evening setting cash on fire and playing Russian roulette with salmonella, Merchant & Trade is the spot for you. If you are a decent human being that just wants a good drink, go to literally any place outside of uptown.",

They did however let in two men with T-shirts, shorts and Adidas sneakers.  Don't waste your time, there are plenty of other upscale spots in uptown Charlotte.",

    "text": "This place is very reminiscent of the rooftop bar I visited while in Las Vegas, Nevada. Upon entry you are greeted by a guard who checks your ID and stamps your hand. Next you're whisked off to an elevator where another guard has to input your floor destination. There are no floor call buttons inside of the elevator. When you arrive on the 19th floor there is a hostess stand that leads into the establishment. Unlike other bars where you can leisurely walk in and step up to the bar and order a drink, you have to be seated and served at a table or seated at the bar.  The space is very open and airy with a covered bar area and open roof seating with a fire pit. Gorgeous city view. There are few TVs throughout but none of them were on at the time.  The service was good and prompt. We enjoyed the fact that all of the juices at the bar were freshly squeezed, so our drinks were super delicious. We ordered the kale chips just to have something to snack on. The chips were crisp and flavorful, but a little messy to eat with all of the loose shaved Parmesan cheese on top. Also be careful of any draft winds. They will knock over your chips and spill them out on the table.  Overall this seemed like a very chill place to hang out after work with a few people. I went on a Thursday afternoon, but I could really see the place transforming over the weekend with a different crowd.",

    "text": "I have previously visited merchant and trade and had a pleasant experience, however on  St. Patrick's weekend a group of individuals  and I had an uncomfortable experience. Upon being \"granted\" access to the main area, we sat at a table that did not have any signage indicating approach a waitress or hostess, we remained seated for 15 minutes and not a single person approached to take a drink order. Instead one of the individuals i was with had to approach the bar. I left, completely annoyed at the experience. I approached security to get the name of the manager, and I instead was confronted with a security guard and other staff who said the issue was based on my actions saying I should have stopped at the hostess table, which we did. Upon refusing to say the managers name I contacted the restaurant directly and was put on an indefinite hold. I had to call again to speak to a hostess, never a manager, who reassured me seating policy is ever changing. Ultimately, this review may go unnoticed but in the future I hope this location can have better communication amongst its staff and management to ensure such misunderstanding never happens again.  It is so unfortunate that a place with a great view and atmosphere can have such poor customer service.",

From first arriving the bouncer/doorman and the elevator hostess were so friendly & inviting, we were even joking around with the doorman before the elevator came. We get to the top and we are greeted by another friendly hostess & we ask to be seated outside. She escorted us to a table & informed us that our server would be right there. 5 stars so far for M&T especially with the retractable cover so we could enjoy the view even though it was drizzling.  We were seating talking and taking in this gorgeous rooftop bar and the beautiful view! Our waitress finally comes but she hands us our menus and walks away, like barely greets us. The whole time she was very inattentive and our drinks kept taking forever to come out. Then me & a friend had ordered the same drink twice and both times one was extremely lower than the other. When we asked her she said it was the ice but both glasses where filled to the top with ice that you could see haven't melted yet. Then she stated \"well I don't know I didn't make them I just put the order in\" with a very rude attitude. If the rest of night had been mediocre I would not go back but she is the reason I would give this place a 2.5 rating because service is everything I especially for a brand new business. I will go back but if the service is this bad again, I can't say there would be a third time supporting this establishment.",
