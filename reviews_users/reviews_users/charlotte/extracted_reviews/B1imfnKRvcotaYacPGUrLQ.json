    "text": "Had the kale caesar to start and the buttermilk fried chicken (like apparently the majority of customers). The salad was very good and the dressing not too overwhelming. I especially how the made the substitute with kale, as it adds a good satsifying crisp to the taste. They gave a strawberry shorbet between the appetizer and entree as to clean the palette. The buttermilk fried chicken was amazing. I've never had fried chicken at a fine dining establishment and it was a very refreshing experience. I'm from the East Coast so I might not have the most reliable comprehension of what the best fried chicken is but it was ridiculously good. The batter was very smooth and thin. The meat itself was very tender and had a distinct juicy flavor which went perfectly with the light gravy that came with it. I wish I could remember it honestly. Writing this review made me so hungry that I had to stop in the middle to eat something. Anyway, the waitress mentioned how the restaurant is owned by two sisters for a very long time and one of them does all of the baking. Next time I'll have to try the dessert.",

    "text": "They've still got it. Perfect lighting, stellar service, pacing is very carefully done. If you want a meal that feels expensive, but really isn't, try Carpe.  The Grilled Grape salad, our fav from the last time we were here, was different, but delicious. Baby romaine, baby arugula, microgreens all tossed with that magical balsamic reduction, tiny pieces of a salty, stinky blue cheese. Every bite was sublime. I sure can't make a salad like this (and believe me, I try regularly).  Cheese plate is reasonably priced, bordering on a steal, depending on what the daily cheese is. Last night, it was a super mild manchego, which complimented the full-frontal-assault of the brie nicely. Accompaniments and plate architecture were fun, and we totally got into pairings based on placement, which a good cheese plate will lead you to do. Awesome.   Entrees were good (mine) and amazing (the special, his). Eggplant roulade, mine, suffered from mush factor (maybe inclusion of walnuts or pine nuts inside the roll would give us something to bite into?). Flavor was stellar - smoky, bite and acid from the tomato concasse complimented the fresh mozz well, but I kept looking for more cheese. Of course, I always am.   His - mushroom bolognese, was flawless, surprisingly rich and meaty and deeply flavorful. Seriously impressive.  We had a bottle of Chardonnay despite being white wine haters. It was really good, and I kept the cork to try and get a hold of some next time I want a good, light wine.  If I were at the helm, there are two or three changes I'd make, and I'll be so bold as to write them here (hey, that's what Yelp's all about, ya?):  More wines by the glass, or a wine flight. A Chef's tasting menu, complete with wine pairings, taking care to offer a vegetarian-specific menu. Another kind of bread (and butter) to go with the delicious rolls already served.  Even after a (for us) pricey bottle of wine and more food than we could finish, our bill landed at $100 (again). Thanks Carpe! Mi amore.",

Started out a bit rocky by being seated at a 2 topper table in the doorway - where one diner would be knocked by all who entered and exited  the dining room. We had reservations so expected better.  We requested something else and were initially given a \"..big wedding party in the back, all other tables taken...\" type of story by the young hostess - with no real satisfaction to us. After we met our server Paige she was oh-so accommodating and suggested we could move to another table in a corner - which may be nosier since it was next to private room with wedding reception - ANYWAY, it all worked out FABULOUSLY. Paige was a dream, professional, personable, and efficient.  Food was fantastic, cocktails were potent and well crafted.   We will most definitely seize the opportunity to dine at CD when we get to Charlotte in the future.  Go there Now - and enjoy!",

Service was on point from the moment you walk in. My husband and I had dinner reservations so we were immediately seated. It was not crowded and the noise level was overall on the quiet side. I highly recommend getting their Prince Edward Island Steamed Mussels. It comes with ciabatta bread slices that you can dip into the mussel sauce for an extra treat. So much flavor and just the right amount to share where it won't get you full to enjoy your main entree. For dinner I had the Seared Sea Scallops and my husband ordered their Grouper special. Both dressed and plated French cuisine-style (small portions) so at first you're thinking, OMG this is it for so much $$$?! But we were both SO FULL, it was actually plenty to eat. To end the meal we chose the coconut cake with pineapple mango gelato which had a little kick of spice. The cake alone was incredible but paired with the gelato, DYNAMITE. Will definitely be ordering a full size of this cake with gelato for upcoming big parties we will host. This spot is perfect for a date or an intimate celebration.",

You'll definitely want to be sure to dress up a bit as the decor and vibe is fancy, but although the crowd was a bit older, it wasn't stuffy. On to the food....  We ordered the calamari appetizer, which was honestly so-so, but it started looking up very quickly after that. The warm rolls and soft butter they bring to the table was very good in combination with the goat cheese salad. The apricot jalapeno vinaigrette dressing was delicious and the three fried goatcheese balls with hazelnut crust were out of this world. You NEED to get this salad if you like goat cheese.   For my main course I had the scallops, which were cooked to perfection. The portion is small (only three per order), but worked for me after the huge salad, bread, and calamari that I'd already eaten. We just had to try dessert, and the peach/raspberry cobbler with ice cream was just the ticket to round off a great dining experience.   The service was very good, and the fare a bit pricey, but as a \"special occasion\" restaurant, this would make my short list. Parking on a Saturday night was a bit tough, but with the other restaurants on that street, it wasn't surprising. And I would definitely recommend making a reservation. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I had dinner at Carpe Diem with a good friend on a recent Tuesday evening.  The company was excellent, but the dining experience wasn't something I am eager to repeat...    First, the atmosphere.  Others have commented on this already, but I really didn't care for the decor or the atmosphere.  The lighting doesn't really work - the restaurant is too bright - and the furniture and flooring just really aren't up to snuff for a restaurant that's going to charge these kinds of prices.  Truth be told, the place reminds me a lot of a funeral parlor... Yeah, I know.  For an appetizer we ordered a salad - priced over $9 - and we told them that we were going to share it.  They split the salad, served it on two plates, and charged us a $2.50 \"split plate fee\".  You're kidding, right?  The salad was good, but not even close to being worth the nearly $12 that they ended up charging us for it.  My friend ordered the Mediterranean sampler from the appetizer menu, and she enjoyed her food - and I am at least glad for that.  My entree, the scallops served with risotto, was fine but overpriced.  For $24 I received three scallops on a bed of risotto.  The risotto was undercooked.  The flavor was fine, but for $24 the risotto should be better than average - especially when there are only three scallops.    To me, this is quintessential \"high end\" Charlotte dining - decent food that is absurdly priced.  If they had charged $8 for our salads and $18 for my entree... it would have been a reasonable value.  For what Carpe Diem charged, though, I just found myself wishing that I had gone somewhere else.",

Very comfortable, quiet restaurant that oozes niceness without being overly fancy or ornate, which is a nice balance.   There's a nice bar in there, not too big, that serves up great pre-dinner cocktails/wine offerings. But it's the food that really had me raving. Great appetizers all around, and even better entrees. Try the grilled grape salad--it was amazing. I had the Mahi Mahi, and it was perfectly done. I also sampled the grilled steak, which was pretty darn good, too. Desserts were also extremely well-done. Again, everything was pretty pricy, but the quality merited that.   I'll definitely be back--even if I have to pay.",

When we were seated at our table we were greeted by a very friendly busboy who filled our water glasses and asked how we were.  Finally the service was outstanding.  Since we are both from up north we had never had grits, so our server brought us out a sample to try and they were excellent.  We both ordered the specials.  Being a vegetarian I was impressed, not only with the selections on the menu, but they also had a vegetarian special.  Everything was amazing.  It was a wonderful evening.

For the main entree, I ordered the vegetarian couscous and hubs got the veggie special of the day. Both were made fresh to order and I savored each bite. It was so good that even as full as I had become, I couldn't stop eating until it was almost gone. The wine list had plenty to choose from to make a nice pairing with your entrees as well.   They try to source what they can from local farms and they make a menu to reflect what is fresh for the season.  I love having a 2-hour dinner without feeling rushed; it makes me feel high class.

They were good - but I enjoyed my friend's dessert more - cherry cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  YUM.   I also enjoyed the 1/3 off all drinks!",

Decor is pretty nice, service was good, got a table easily on a Saturday night (hmmm).  The food was good, not terrible, not great.  We split the chopped salad with gorgonzola.  I had a pasta dish (tagliatelli maybe), that was fine, but kinda bland.  I dunno - just not that great and I won't go back.   \"Over-rated\" clap-clap clap-clap-clap.",

The only person in our party who didn't order the chicken ordered the pork, which was a really great twist on pork chops and apple sauce. Our appetizers and salads were excellent too.   One of the cooler things was that the staff knew about the occasion and had celebratory confetti on our table waiting for us when we arrived.  The staff was really friendly and helpful as well.   All in all a great experience and a restaurant that I would recommend to anyone in Charlotte.",

We did this and the only option was tasty but smaller than a sample. Although we had reservations the table was not ready because there were 2 large parties that we were sandwiched in between. Those two parties demanded all the servers attention therefore inadvertently diminishing our attention. Maybe this is the best this city has to offer but my hopes were high due to all the recommendations but for $20.00 a plate I would like dinner not a sample. I rated this restaurant a 3 meaning it was ok. Will I return? Possibly. Will I recommend this place? Not at this time.",

    "text": "The service was great! The lady that waited on us, was on her A game. The food left a lot to be desired. The Mushroom Bolanase with Oyster Mushrooms, plain and boring. The Taglatel pasta was clumpy, and sauce didn't penetrate the center of the clump. You couldn't taste the mushrooms in the sauce. It was a dish that got your hopes up, and left you hanging. The last time I was there I had the fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy, and Asparagus. The chicken was flat tasting, and had very little seasoning in the crust. It was extremely crunchy, well cooked, and moist in the center. You could get better fried chicken at Bojangles, and for a lot less money. The potatoes were real potatoes, but at least a day old, and cold in the middle. The asparagus was cooked to perfection, but untrimmed. We would hate to put the staff out, by asking the to prep the asparagus. I am a chef and would die before, I would let these dishes out of my kitchen. When the plate goes out, you should have pride in your work and put your best efforts forward. The margins in this restaurant are fat, and the quality should reflect that. Don't break your neck to get there. This is a good place for a great restaurant, to bad hasn't happened.",

    "text": "I'm somewhat surprised by all of the rave reviews, because this place was just OK. Admittedly, I'm from out of town and my hometown has more foodie culture, but I still feel like Carpe Diem leaves a lot to be desired. The service may have been the biggest disappointment, as while they were friendly they were inattentive. I think we only saw our waitress 3 times during the meal (once to order, once or twice during the meal, and then to bring the check). We weren't offered refills on our beverages, which was a bit frustrating. We had to find another server (not our assigned server) to refill my BF's beer and I was never offered more than one glass of wine. The food itself was mediocre. Not bad, but not great. The flavors weren't well balanced, so dishes became quite one dimensional. For example my BF ordered the pork chop and the accompanying risotto overwhelmingly tasted of garlic (and I love garlic, but this was a bit much). Likewise, the shrimp and grits were over powered by the jalapeno bacon, which left me underwhelmed. On the bright side, the shrimp seemed fresh and didn't have a fishy flavor. The carpaccio was terrible, in my opinion. If you like mustard, you would probably love the carpaccio, but again it was too strong in the dish. While I like all of the aforementioned flavors, I don't like them so strong that I can't appreciate other flavors within the dish, which was my primary issue with Carpe Diem. The atmosphere was fine, but perhaps not as high-end as they think. Overall it's an OK place to go for an easy dinner, but I wouldn't go for a special occasion or date night. Maybe I'm a snob? With so many other restaurants in the area I don't think we'll be back, because there must be something better out there.",

    "text": "I'm not one to dish out five stars for just any restaurant, but Carpe Diem is definitely deserving.  The fella and I made reservations for a Saturday at 6:45 and stopped by an hour early to have a pre-dinner drink at the bar.  We walked in and were promptly greeted by the hostess and manager.  We grabbed a seat at the semi-circular bar; the fella ordered his usual dirty martini with Tito's Vodka, and I had a specialty cocktail that I can't remember the name of, but it was like a gin and tonic with cucumber, which made it even more refreshing.  Our bartender was engaging without being omnipresent, and after about 20 minutes, more people started to filter into the bar area, which was cozy - there were not only stools at the bar, but also comfy looking loveseats and chairs around the perimeter - and almost had a Tuscan feel.  After our drink, we moved into the dining room and got the best seat in the house!  There's one table in almost a cubby hole with curtains that I guess you could close if you wanted, and it's an awesome seat.  Even more awesome was the food.  We got the beef carpaccio to start ($10), and I loved the mustard and capers gave it just enough tang without being too spicy, and the ciabatta bread was a perfect accompaniment.  For dinner, I got the pork tenderloin ($25) with fried plantains - the entire reason I got the dish - and BBQ baked Sea Island peas.  Now, I hate regular peas, but these had some sweet onions mixed in, and I ate every bite of food on my plate.  The fella got the Scottish salmon ($25), and he said it plus the scallion-ginger relish on top was pretty darn delicious.  We checked out the dessert menu, but we were too stuffed to try anything.  Also, our waitress was very nice and down to earth and came over the perfect amount of times to check on us without being annoying.  So, not only was the food amazing, but the atmosphere is also right up my alley - it's good food without being too snooty.  We, like a lot of other customers, were in nice jeans, but it certainly didn't feel like it was fancy.  If you wanted to dress up, that'd be fine, and if you wanted to be a little more casual, that'd be fine, too.  We can't wait to go back.",

While the service was spot on and the cocktails and wine selection were excellent, everything else lacked.   We arrived around 6 pm and the restaurant was far from busy.  While our server was excellent, explained the specials and took our orders very efficiently, the wait for our food was something else.  Kitchen management needs improving as our order took forever.  Several tables that were seated after us were on dessert while we were still waiting for our main courses.  To be fair, we were a larger party (9), but with the restaurant being so slow there should not have been such a long wait.   However, I am ok waiting if what I get in the end is worth it.  Unfortunately it wasn't.  While our entrees were not \"bad\", they were nothing exceptional either.  Just ok.  Scallops were probably the best of all and the hanger steak was cooked perfectly and paired well with the sauce.  Again, nothing wrong with the food, just expected more.  The atmosphere is nice - especially the bar.  Will consider returning for cocktails and appetizers, but doubt we will give dinner a try again.",

Overall we had a good experience, nice time with couple fails on their part..  Best: We both liked the ambience the place - lived up to their name \"carpe diem\" (which means be in the present - the ambience definitely helped us to enjoy the present moment). Since we had a reservation and I had mentioned on the phone that its for birthday, they went an extra mile and decorated our table with little birthday sparkles. That was very nice of them, to make ma bday buddy feel special :) Food was good, nothing extravagant to rave about, the food presentation was very nice! We got a salad, cheese plate, I ordered pasta from the special menu and my friend got Scottish salmon. Everything tasted good and fresh!   Service was good and prompt but they can definitely do better. I agree with one of the reviews here - Prior to the entrees, we were served a cleansing sorbet which tasted good.  However, the server never bothered to tell us anything about it and why we are being served something we didn't order - she just set them down in front of us - not explaining what it was/the flavor/or anything.   Could be better: It was a birthday dinner and I wanted to order a surprise dessert so I stood up making a restroom excuse to find our server and order dessert. When I didn't see the server anywhere in the dining area, assumed she was inside the kitchen, I went to the receptionist, placed my order and told him it was a surprise. He assured me that he will pass on the order and make sure our server knows it's a surprise. This was a big bummer - the server comes after 5-6 min and asks us for desert order :( unwantedly I had to tell her that I placed an order with the receptionist, next thing I see is she comes with the desert with happy birthday written on the plate and a bday candle I had requested; but she gets it right to me and says happy birthday. This was very disappointing. I was like Really? You think I will go and place a surprise desert order for myself? Poor communication between staff.. The dessert was delicious although Service  could have been better.",

I wasn't a big fan of the pumpkin waffles (the pumpkin flavor was a bit too strong for me, but the waffle itself was amazing), and he didn't like the blue cheese on his beef, or the sauce on the side. But we did enjoy our entrees nonetheless. The dessert was okay, it actually disappointed me a bit. He had the Mexican chocolate cake and I had the chocolate torte. The chocolate was just so strong and there wasn't enough other flavors for me to balance it--this might be a nice dessert for chocolate lovers.   They also decorated our table with Happy Birthday confetti, which was a nice touch. There was an awkward moment when I was eating bread while waiting for our dessert, and our server took the bread away while I was in the middle of holding a piece, chewing it. My boyfriend said, \"Excuse me, she's not done with that,\" while the server was about to leave the table. She put it back and apologized... was it not obvious that I was still eating it??",

Suggest perhaps you mention that on your website as I tried to do a little investigation before I left and didn't see anything.  Otherwise it was an amazing experience.  From a perfectly made cocktail to start with, to great service and great food, I enjoyed it all.  The atmosphere was beautiful and warm.  I admittedly am a little sensitive to having servers try to whisk my plate away when I lay my fork down. I am dining, and take a break occasionally to enjoy the company I am with and savor my meal. But, it was a minor distraction.  I look forward to returning and trying more menu items.",

    "text": "I made a reservation online though open table, something I thought we might need as it was restaurant week, although we weren't going for restaurant week.   My husband wanted to treat me to a date night, and had been raving over their fried chicken for almost a year when we decided we would go.   After looking at the restaurant week menu, we thought we would just go with the entree because I'm not into salads, and we knew we would be too full for dessert.   The waitress brought out warm bread before we ordered, but the food came out so quickly we weren't able to finish the bread.   We both ordered the fried chicken with yukon gold mashed potatoes, black pepper gravy, and spinach. Not really being a big fan of spinach I asked for mine on the side. Surprisingly I did eat some of it when it came out, it was actually pretty good. For my taste I would have liked more salt, but they only have pepper on the table.   The fried chicken is boneless, a huge plus in my book. The gravy is also white gravy, and not brown gravy, which is also another plus. The mashed potatoes were great, some lumps but more smooth, perfect.   Overall we had a great time. Once we sat down at our table we were out in 45 minutes, super fast, great service.   **Just a note we had reservations for 5:30 but wanted to have a drink at the bar beforehand. They only open at 5, so we didn't have much time to sit. If ordering a drink, best to go with something simple like a liquor plus a mixer. Keeps the price down.",

Carpe Diem is located on the amazing strip in Elizabeth, along with Customshop, Passion 8, Viva Chicken and Earl's grocery to name a few. The restaurant is quite large with a large bar area up front that is great to get a drink or have a more casual dinner. The dining room is nice and quite formal though you can easily get away with nice jeans and a collared shirt.   The menu is fantastic. We've never had anything we don't like. A few favorites...fried chicken and scallops. In my opinion, this is the best fried chicken in Charlotte. Amazing crust, very tender and juicy. It is served with mashed potatoes and a pepper gravy. The scallops are my wife's favorite. Tender, always great texture (important with scallops).",

    "text": "S'wonderful, s'mahvelous.    What a wonderful evening in a beautiful restaurant with delicious food!  The other reviews about the romantic atmosphere are spot on - the exposed wood, low lighting, gorgeous light fixtures, white table clothes, comfy chairs, artwork... everything is just perfection.    We had an early reservation that on a dreary January Tuesday evening wasn't really necessary, but it's always nice to have the option - I would imagine that on date nights, this establishment is packed.  We were able to easily park in one of the two large lots for Elizabeth Ave businesses.  Be mindful of the tracks that run down the street, cracking your ass in front of a first date could be catastrophic (or a good story for later).    Fresh, warm bread and butter (plentiful butter, instead of one tablespoon that people have to fight for) were brought to the table.  Our waitress explained the specials of the evening in detail and gave us time to look at the menu and decide.  I opted for the fried (boneless) chicken breast and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach with shallot-black pepper gravy.  My serving was two smaller chicken breasts that were fried perfectly, not greasy at all, and were very tender/juicy.  The mashed potatoes were buttery delicious and the sauteed spinach was seasoned just right.  The portion and flavors were spot on!  For dessert I had the cherry cobbler which was served with vanilla ice cream.  Again - perfect.  Buttery cobbler with just-tart-enough cherries, and just enough ice cream and whipped cream to complement the dish, but not dairy it down.    From the moment we walked in the door, I could tell it was going to be a wonderful evening.  The host was friendly and helpful (asking if we were celebrating any kind of occasion), the waitress and staff were attentive without hovering and the food was one of the best meals that I have had recently.    Queen's Feast 2015 is starting soon - I would definitely put Carpe Diem on the list as a stop!",

Carpe Diem is the quintessential date night restaurant.  It features romantic lighting, a carved ceiling and large paintings of flowers.  What could be sexier than that?   We had reservations and were seated immediately.  There were several nice wine selections by the glass, and, although they were pricey, they gave you a darn good pour.  In fact, one glass each took us through dinner. We were brought the most delicious bread with butter.  I rarely eat bread, but when I sampled theirs, I ate one and a half pieces.  Bad girl! I was pleased to see that they featured Anson Mills products on their menu.  And, even more delighted with the offerings of vegetarian and vegan selections. They even had a vegetarian special for the night.  How thoughtful! I did  order that vegetarian special.  It was a tart with a whole grain crust, covered with tomatoes, asparagus, cheese and a perfectly cooked over easy egg.  Phenomenal!  My date ordered the Anson Mills rice grits dish that featured their sea island red peas and Gouda cheese.  He chose the mushroom option instead of the shrimp.  Again, a stellar dish.   A five star rating seems skimpy with this kind of quality.  I rate them an entire solar system!",

    "text": "This fine restaurant deserves 5 stars if for no other reason than the hands-down most artistic and romantic ambiance in the entire Metrolina region.  Seriously, I feel like I'm sitting in Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole with all the bowed wood and twisted iron.  The wine rack behind the bar looks like a many-branched oak tree.  The bar and dining room just call for a most-intimate dinner.  Luckily, the food is just as quality as the environment.  Little galvanized metallic boxes hold fresh-baked rolls for the table.  The many-seeded variety are best- tasty and a good mix of crunch crust with a softer inside.  For a salad course, I'm a big big fan of the grilled grape.  The micro-greens are always garden-fresh and when you get a grape, they each have just a hint of smoke taste that blends nicely with the blue cheese but is a unique surprise.  The goat cheese salad is also very good, but still in second place, in this Yelper's humble opinion.  Between the salads and the entree, we've always had a small intermezzo course of fresh sorbet.  The flavor changes, but is a great palette cleanser regardless.    Entrees run the gamut from a couple fresh fishes, pork chop, and a (very tasty) buttermilk pan fried chicken.  The selection is well manicured so that just about anyone can find an option.  The even make a point to have at least one vegetarian entree option every night.  Even the vegetables that accompany the protein are artfully done.  Foodies will appreciate the detail that goes not only into each of these dish's components, but the way the flavors and matched together.  I'm even a raving fan of their desserts.  These can change regularly, but you can count on at least one chocolate option and a cheesecake.  Everything is made from scratch and the portions are perfect for sharing.  The staff works in a team approach, though your server is leading the effort.  Courses and delivery are expertly paced and everyone is very knowledgable about the menu and the bar.  I always feel very well taken care of.  We can never seem to leave here for under $50 a person, with a drink or two, but I never mind, the quality of the food and the service are on a plane above most of what you'll find around town.",

Casual elegance- pretty wooden arches and lighting- sat by a large window.  Not too stuffy- we were fine in jeans.  Soft music in background allows conversion to flow without shouting.  Family next to us dined with their happy,loudly talkative baby and no one minded her.  :).   We had our 10 year old daughter and 6 yo son with us. Everyone scarfed down the delish bread and butter.  Jack had fried chicken tenders and mashed potatoes- best any of us ever tasted!  Bella had shells with white sauce and real Parmesan on top- it was good, but the Parmesan is NOT from a bottle like it is at home, and she was not fond of it.  I suggest getting it on the side just in case your kids might agree w/her.  I got the goat cheese salad because it was so praised, only to discover I am not fond of warm balls of goat cheese.  I guess I am a cold goat cheese gal.  My hubby liked it, though.  The waitress was very attentive.  I tried To convince her my salad was okay, but upon her further questioning, I fessed up and said I wasn't a huge fan of it.  My hubby loved his Salmon, even though it looked to be a small piece, he felt satisfied with it.  I got the veggie plate for my meal-  way too tangy for me, due to the glazes on them.  Told the busboy I was finished with almost a full plate left.  He tipped off the manager, who was concerned that I wasn't happy, and she offered me something else, but I was full on bread, salad, and sampling the kids' meals, so I declined.  She took BOTH off our bill, even though I had eaten all the salad, because I said I wasn't crazy about it.  We did share two desserts amongst the 4 of us.  The peanut butter pie was dense and rich, but not overly peanut-buttery.  My son doesn't like peanut butter but loved it!  Chocolate crepes were delish- homemade ice cream melts quickly though, so eat fast!  The ice cream was the best I've ever had.  I would definitely return and get fried chicken or another entree next time- the service and atmosphere are great!",

Probably the best I ever had!  Juicy, tender and delicious.  My wife had the chicken dish, which I think is their specialty.  I took a taste and could see why.

Minus a quarter star (thus retaining the 5 stars) for the dessert (a cocoanut cupcake with cream cheese frosting).

Small details such as ceiling molding that curves and allows light to sift through, just adds another touch of class.

He was able to share all of the specials without having to recite from any cards.  He responded well to our many questions regarding the menu.    Food - just perfect.

The garnishes allowed you to make your own little test experiments.  Mmmm!  For dinner I ordered the \"Eggplant Roulade.\"  It was delicious.  It does have a smokey flavor to the sauce which I was initially hesitant about.  After trying it, I did like it.  Overall, I enjoyed my selection.  Next time, I will try the Cous Cous.  The waiter gave it very high marks.  I will definitely be visiting Carpe Diem again!",

    "text": "Hostess was prompt at stand, got seated right at our reserved time. Bussers/server assistants were on point with bread and water but that is where you lost me. Server was hard to understand and extremely soft spoken, we could barely understand the specials. She was quite unaccommodating and simply not present. We went strait to entrees seeing that the restaurant had filled, thinking it would save time. I ordered the filet w mashed and my significant other, the pork tenderloin. When the food came out the presentation was beautiful but once we took a dive it was a different story. My filet requested medium came out mooing unseasoned. I sent it back to have corrected of course. Now being that I served tables in fine dining establishments throughout my twenties I expected a manager to run out the corrected entree and make sure it was right before leaving with an apology. The server brought back my steak practically tossed it back at me and run off, continuing to present an unwelcoming and distasteful impression. Now again the filet was unseasoned and still at best mid rare. I told her 10 minutes later when she finally showed her face again, to simply take my place I wanted no more of their dreadful cooking. Asked for a check right away thinking our anger would advise her to have management certainly come by to speak with us but again, and much to no surprise this time she came back with a check. We paid and left with no apology, explanation or condolence. Safe to say we wont return, and advise others to simply spend their money dining at an establishment that prides themselves in ensuring proper service and hospitality with results. With there being so many delicious options in the Elizabeth area, its no wonder I have never heard of you. To end, we felt invisible and ill-advised.",

The scallops are fantastic when they're served with almond risotto. I've also had the steak which comes with a great sauce and potatoes and asparagus. Buttermilk chicken is my new favorite. Menu is seasonal and changes so that makes it interesting each time I go. Always have to start with the goat cheese salad...so good with tons of flavor!   If you're in the mood for more than one restaurant in one night. Start at Customshop next door for drinks and an app and go here for dinner.",

It's a lovely restaurant- beautifully appointed and as Julia S points out - stellar service and impeccable pacing.   I've taken many of visiting family members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary meal. It's not a cheap meal, but it's well priced for the quality and quantity. For two of us with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...  Warm Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm goat cheese over delicious greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.  Cheese Plate: A very generous and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar.   Scallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Plus they give you a very generous portion of large scallops. YUM.  Desserts: They special make their desserts daily and I wish I could remember what I've had here. I know I've had some delicious type of creme brulee and something uber chocolately. Regardless, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with their dessert selection!",

The  dirty martini was well made, and the salad with fried goat cheese was very nice! I liked the touches like sorbet between appetizers to clear the palate and the little giraffe holding olives on my martini glass. We'll definitely return and highly recommend.",

For desert I had the Oero chocolate mousse the chocolate was wonderful the oreo crust was fabulous, cant wait to go back, i see they have mon-Thur 1/2 price apps from 5-630 i'm gonna try that one evening.

Beef carpaccio, muscles, cauliflower pizza, strawberry salad etc. These were all apps so we treated them like tapas, which was a great call. Allowed us to experiment more without getting too full.

    "text": "So many words/phrases come to mind when I think of Carpe Diem like A Charlotte Classic, Best restaurant atmosphere, best splurge restaurant, beautiful decor, exceptional staff, 5 star!, absolutely fabulous flavors and so many more.  The dinner group celebrated it's 3rd anniversary here tonight.  We gathered in the bar area until the majority of our group arrived.  I was in a wine drinking mood tonight but couldn't decide on which red.  The server said I could taste anything and gave me a few recommendations.  I am not normally picky on red wines but I was tonight.  No problem here!  They let me sample 4 wines until I found the right one.    The food menu is small but the items they have on it, they absolutely excel at.  Some of the favorites at our table were the warm goat cheese salad, the scallops and the salmon.  I had the the latter and it was recommended to me by our server.  The salmon was so tender it melted in my mouth.  It was served on a bed of \"forbidden rice\" which is a black rice that is considered the finest around.  It also came in a light sauce which was quite delicious.  For dessert, I went with the pear apple cake which came with a black pepper ice cream which sounded so intriguing.  The ice cream did not disappoint.  It was slightly sweet with a pepper kick.  Very imaginative!  The cake was moist and flavorful but I didn't really care for the icing.  The service was exceptional.  The staff was constantly checking on us, taking plates and glasses, refilling drinks, giving recommendations.    Also, the decor in here is simply stunning with wood beams and metal across the ceiling and decorative lighting that fits well.  But the most stunning thing is the bar area.  The wine rack behind the bar actually looks like a tree with the wine bottles stuffed in the branches.  I wish I had taken a picture of this.    Besides the icing, the only other flaw I found was that for parties of 6 or more, tip is included in the bill.  If you pay with a card, they write in the tip amount for you and total.  Some people may think this is a great idea but it also prevents you from adding an additional tip in the event you had exceptional service.     Still, Carpe Diem is worth the 5 star rating and then some.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place out since I first got to Charlotte so when I saw they were participating in restaurant week I made a reservation right away ($30 for a 3 courses). We came here last Saturday night with our friend Paul who had never been here before either.   While RW can sometimes take away from the experience certain restaurants would typically provide, it's a great opportunity to see what the restaurant might be all about without walking out of there with a $200 tab. What it really comes down to at a place like Carpe Diem, $30 would typically get you just an entree. So you can look at it however you would like, but pretty much just tell myself that I get a free appetizer and desert with my meal.  All 3 of us participated in the 3 for $30 - However, since they were offer their full menu as well, we started our meal by sharing the seared rare tuna as well as the steamed mussels. Both were VERY good.   I then had the potato soup. It had a little bit of truffle oil and what they call \"duck bacon\". Paul and I both agreed that there is only one type of bacon in this world and it comes from animal that goes \"oink oink\" haha. With that said, the soup was tasty and of course I inhaled the entire thing. I then had the pork chop - I would have to say this this was just average. However the mashed dumpling squash that came with it was very very good. It might have been the highlight of the entire entree. I had a bite of the hanger steak as well as the fried chicken and those were both delicious. Of the 3 entrees that came out I would say the pork chop came in last place.   For dessert I had the coffee creme brulee. For my liking, the top was a little over cooked/torched - I really had to press down to break it with my spoon - but I didn't mind it. The custard was delicious so it kind of makes up for it.  Since meeting Paul, he's been really teaching us a whole lot when it come to wine. There's a reason why he's the \"wine guy\". He's picked up on the types that we like and brought a GREAT bottle of wine to dinner for all of us to enjoy (THANKS PAUL!!) Overall, I had a great evening and I got to enjoy CD with GREAT COMPANY.   I can't wait to come back and try this place again!",

So it is a nice place to take a MaleFriend and have a quiet Dinner!  Not as Pricey as you would think for the Total Experience!  Beef is usually what I want here and I have tasted many of the other dishes my Friends have ordered... Entrees are Meals (not a la carte) and a VALUE for the Quality! Potato (dish) many different ones, sometimes a Potato Pasta... One time we got here so early (5:00 PM) the Chef had not decided what he was going to do and let us decide... (Thin Cut Fries... YES!!!) this is a Funny place to order Fries I know and though they were good, I would rather the Chef use his Ideas, Imagination, Recipes or the internet over mine!  Salad Dressings are so good it is hard to choose! I have enjoyed them ALL!  Food here is Better than Del Frisco's (I will NOT be reviewing Del Frisco's) I have eaten at both in the Same Week!  The Sauces here are better than \"The Palm\"!  Value, Service and Desserts Here is better than Both!!!",

We ate the filet which was rich and cooked to an exquisite medium rare. We requested goat cheese instead of blue cheese and the chef was more than accommodating. We ended the meal with the Mexican Hot Chocolate cake and coffee ice cream.   The food was remarkable and we will certainly return.",

Unfortunately we found it to be a bit of a miss.  When we walked in the restaurant decor seems dated, or perhaps just generic.  The tables were oddly oriented in the room and despite there being space elsewhere in the restaurant we were seated directly in front of the swinging door to the kitchen. Then there was the food.  The goat cheese salad was overdressed and somewhat soggy; the kale caesar and beet salad were marginally better.  I had the venison as a main which was average and oversalted; others had the friend chicken which was not at all crispy and so was a big disappointment.  We didn't order dessert because we were disappointed in the meal and weren't really up for another round.",

    "text": "The mister and I came here as part of Queen's Feast, which can always be a dicey time to give an accurate review of a restaurant. However, I think a solid 4 stars is quite spot on. Here's why:  I was pleasantly surprised with the large portion sizes because many restaurants tend to skimp for these kind of events. I had the kale salad and the mister had the goat cheese salad to start. Both were delicious and entree-sized portions. I appreciated the gelato as a palate cleanser between the first and second courses. We also sampled the pork chop and the shrimp and grits, which appeared to be regular items on their menu. The pork chop was massive, and the squash puree was a nice complement. I love creme brulee, so the dessert was the star of my meal.   I also had the Southern Julep cocktail with my meal, but after having lived in Kentucky for several years, I can't sing the praises of a julep without the mint leaves, so that missed the mark for me. The mint was supposed to be infused according to the menu, but it seemed to have zero mint flavor to me.   As as an aside from the food, many other reviews noted the ambiance, but truthfully, I wasn't digging it. For a Friday evening at dinner time, the restaurant was surprisingly quiet for being busy, and I wouldn't necessarily describe it as having low, romantic lighting either. The crowd seemed generally older, so maybe a great place to take parental visitors.",

    "text": "Full disclosure my meal was paid by a dinner talk so I suppose you would classify this as a catered dinner to a large group. The servers seemed uptight but it seems to have stemmed from the management. Appetizers were bland. Mini crab cakes that were mostly filler and the cocktail shrimp were not all deveined. I order the fish entree to stick to the lighter side. Hours later I am so patched and feel like I will be up all night drinking water because the dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. A few folks overestimate the buttermilk chicken, which looked delicious, however I am unable to eat that due to dietary restrictions. The creme brulee was okay. Nothing to right home about. If I had paid for the dinner I would have been extremely unhappy. The waiters would not even box our desserts or meals to go which I thought was extremely odd. I will not be back here as a paying customer. I really don't see at this price point, how the food is worth it.",

    "text": "Went here for Restaurant Week with my friends Marco and Allyson. With all the rave reviews, I had high expectations, and Carpe Diem delivered!  The first thing you notice is the decor. A LOT of work has been put into making Elizabeth Avenue Charlotte's premier dining destination, and it really looks great! The trolley will FINALLY provide service this summer after a decade of work, and I'm sure the business owners can't wait to finally get that trolley up and running. The interior of Carpe Diem is very beautiful, with dim lights but not \"dark\" (don't need to use your smartphone camera light to read the menus....yeay!). Lots of wood all around and a very romantic atmosphere.  Since we all chose the Restaurant Week menu, we of course were limited to that selection. However, we couldn't resist ordering a couple of things off their \"regular\" menu, and we got the Seared Tuna and Mussels Apps, The Mussels had a cilantro white wine broth that was delicious. The tuna was cooked perfectly with that nice sear with sesame seeds on top. So off to a good start!  I started off with a potato soup with truffle oil. Now if you know me, I order anything that's got the word \"truffle\" in it and it was a solid effort. I would have liked a bit more truffle oil as I think they put just a couple of drops so I really couldn't taste too much truffle. Allyson got the salad with goat cheese and THAT was quite tasty as the goat cheese was lightly coated and flash fried. Love chevre!  They then surprised us with an Intermezzo sorbet with Thyme to cleanse our palates. Nice touch.  Next up was the Hangar Steak with crumbled blue cheese and creamed kale. I asked our waitress to bring it however the Chef recommends, and she asked if Medium Rare was good. I said yes! But it came out more \"rare\" than medium, but it was still tasty. I'm not a huge blue cheese lover, but the older I get the more adventurous my taste buds become so I now order things I never used to. While good, it still confirms that blue cheese is not my favorite. The creamed kale was average, and this also confirms that I do not like the hard, chewy texture of kale.  My buddy Marco got the pork chop and Allyson got the fried chicken. After tasting both, I thought Allyson's chicken was the best thing on the table. It was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. In comparison, this chicken was better than the famed Leroy Fox's. The pork chop was good but not mind blowing.  The piece de resistance was the dessert! I got the Chocolate Crepes with caramel sauce and creme angliese. OMG were these things DELICIOUS! They were filled with a chocolate mousse or creme...no matter, it was EFFEN GOOD! Marco got the coffee flavored creme brulee and that also was quite delicious!  Because my friends were kind enough to invite me to this special meal, I brought a great Napa Merlot (their fave, not mine) from Nickel and Nickel. I figure IF I'm to endure a Merlot, might as well bring a top notch one, and it paired nicely with our food! Their corkage fee was only $15 which I find very reasonable for such a top end place.  So thanks to Marco and Allyson for making a generous invite. We've all become good friends in such a short period of time....remarkable how FOOD can bond people, even though I'm more than 20 years older than them.  And thanks to Carpe Diem for delivering another really good restaurant week experience! I look forward to going back!",

I made everyone get the warm goat cheese salad, which was a hit, I ordered the venison which was awesome but I got a side of mashed potatoes which filled me up, don't think I would have got full without it!

She had a kale salad with grilled chicken and was blown away. I told them about the occasion when I made the reservation, and when we arrived they had put confetti on the table which was a nice touch, and the server immediately congratulated is upon greeting, little things like that go a long way with me.  I had the grilled quail with a butternut squash puree, and for dessert we shared a toffee cheesecake. This was one of the best meals I've had in recent memory, and after a couple glasses of wine, two entrees, dessert, and tip, the bill was only about 80 dollars, and I promise it was worth every penny. Will DEFINITELY be returning here",

Friday evening we made a reservation at Carpe Diem. Parking is on-site and it is located near Passion 8, Earle's Grocery, Viva Chicken, etc in Elizabeth.   I ordered a glass of Zinfandel, which was delicious and my husband got a beer. They had a decent wine by bottle selection. The also brought out warm bread to start, which was super tasty!  We started with the Meze Plate that definitely didn't disappoint. Beef kabobs (amazingly tender), olives, zuchinni fritters (these things were perfection!), Naan, hummus, and artichokes. It was like a cheese plate or charcuterie board but ten million times better!  For dinner we got the buttermilk chicken and the scallops. I would have never ordered fried chicken at a nice restaurant but I decided to take the suggestion of fellow yelpers. This was easily the best food of the evening. The chicken was perfectly buttery. Loved the mashed potatoes with it. Large portion. The scallops were fantastic. Large bay scallops and the puree underneath was delicious.   For dinner we got the peanut butter cake to end an excellent evening. Great service and incredible meal!",

    "text": "I've heard a great deal of hype about Carpe Diem, and I confess, it is warranted. Great family-owned restaurant and great experience all around.  It is clear that this restaurant does well, and has many regulars who attend. The food and service was top notch. You never have to worry about having an empty water glass, or even bread bowl. They will refill your bread bowl infinite times (huge plus). I thought the bread was decent - could have been seasoned more (I say this despite the fact I ate 3 pieces).   They have an extensive cocktail list - all between $10 and $12. They don't offer a huge selection of wines by the glass; probably 4-5 glass options of red and white. You're better off ordering a bottle.   I came in set on ordering the fried chicken because that is what people rave about and it's been on their menu for 20+ years. I was mentally prepared to not even look at other options. However, I then glanced at the menu and saw the duck confit option over pumpkin waffles that couldn't be ignored - so we were set on that. And then, I was just craving some scallops.   The crispy fried duck confit leg should be your go to choice. It comes over two triangle pumpkin waffles with maple butter, atop crispy kale. I don't know how, but somehow the kale works in this dish, and works well. The crispy duck is amazing fall off the bone. It was so tender and flavorful. I had to just take a few bites off the duck confit itself to savor the flavor. I don't mean to undermine the scallops in this review. They were still very delicious - atop a medium sized crunchy piece of pancetta, a handful of brussel sprouts and parsnip puree. SO GOOD!! But the duck confit wins in originality, creativity and all around awesomeness.  we didn't get dessert this time - maybe next time. I'll be back, Carpe Diem!",

    "text": "4.5 stars, rounded up for excellent service.  Lovely restaurant owned by two sisters for the last 20-something years in the Elizabeth area.  Their menu is what adrove me to bookmark this spot and eventually try it out today, finally!  A short Uber ride later, we arrived to an almost-empty restaurant on a Tuesday evening, which eventually became more filled as the evening went on.  The crowd seemed like the business crew, since I recognized all the finance and tech speak that was going around at all the tables.  Our server was extremely friendly, patient, and helpful.  She always kept coming back to check on us - gotta love that Southern hospitality!  We started off with 3 appetizers: - Grilled octopus - probably one of the smallest pieces of grilled octopus in the form of an appetizer I've ever seen.  However, it was of a good texture and cooked fairly well, though it could have been slightly more tender. - Beef carpaccio - I would not recommend this if you are not a mustard fan.  It's covered in a tangy, slightly spicy mustard.  The beef itself is sliced so thin that you hardly taste anything except the mustard - probably the only downside of this dish. - Mussels - the broth is flavorful and different from the typical white wine and garlic both and the crostini that came with it was amazing.  However, I just wasn't all that impressed by the mussels - they could have been infused with more flavor from the broth and the texture of the mussels were way softer than I am used to - they basically fell apart when I tried to take them out of the shell. Overall, I'd have to say the apps were a 3-4 star quality in my personal opinion.  For my entree, I chose the venison, cooked medium rare and loved it.  Everything about this dish was good, from the well-seasoned, perfectly cooked venison to the very flavorful kale and pancetta.  This dish is quite a bit tangy what with the wine/grape sauce, but I love tangy food so this was great for me.  We went a little wild on dessert and ordered three.  The toasted coconut cake with ice cream was nothing short of amazing and was my favorite item of the desserts.  It was a very moist cake with cream cheese frosting and not too sweet.  It was also HUGE.  It went very well with the spicy pineapple and cold ice cream.  YUM.  I would definitely go there and get just this again.  The creme brulee was pretty standard - it had a great vanilla bean flavor to it.  Unfortunately, I didn't try the shortbread cookie.  The mexican hot chocolate cake was just too chocolately and rich for me, and thus I did not have much.  Definitely, definitely go for the coconut cake when you're there.  5 stars for this.  Great experience here - would recommend to business travelers and tourists to CLT!",

Get it .. you will not be disappointed! Flavor is great, portion size is ample and it's just tasty!  Ali had house salad which was full of flavor as well.  Scallops were other specialty they recommended, but I opted for the bird ... menu has great variety so everyone can find something.  Prices are very reasonable and you don't leave feeling  guilty for blowing a bunch of money on a meal.",

I've always wanted to try Carpe Diem but never got the chance and was a little afraid to have a catered service as my first experience. To my surprise, the food and the serving staff were brilliant! I loved the chicken that was served, it had a great spinach alfredo stuffing. The pasta shells and meatballs were also delicious. The sides consisted of garlic bread and assorted steamed veggies, the veggies could have been seasoned better. The side salad was tossed well with a good amount of dressing and had a great crunch. All in all, they rocked the savory dishes. The dessert consisted of lemon curd bars and blueberry crumble squares, they were a little sweet for my taste.   But, the servers that came with the catered service made the experience ten times better! I was so impressed with how nice and attentive they were for a small catered luncheon. Thanks for the great experience, this will definitely bring me in for a regular sit down service.",

Every dish has great flavor and presentation, so you can tell that the chefs care about the food that goes out. The atmosphere is great for a big party, family, and a special occasion like a mentioned above but it is also romantic enough for a nice night out. Everything on the menu is amazing but my favorites are the Duck Confit and Waffles and for dessert the Mexican Hot Chocolate Cake!",

For dessert we ordered the fruit cobbler, which for that time of the year it was blackberry and very delicious.

The salmon was served with potatoes, which were pretty bland.   On the other hand, the grape salad and the pork tenderloin entree were very good.  I'm not sure if I will come back again if I have other choices.",

The grilled grape salad is nothing special at all. I didn't find the flavor combination to be balanced. The buttermilk fried chicken was just ok. It's two breasts that are obviously brined, wet battered and then fried. Not much flavor or seasoning except in the gravy, which is a milk based white gravy, so has breakfasty feel. The mashed potatoes were good but the spinach was unseasoned. The coffee creme brulee has an excellent flavor but a weak texture.  All in all, I was underwhelmed but now I know! The hype isn't real.  Highest Recommendation: The Seafood Soup, which happened to be tonight's special.",

They had enough salt/pepper on the salad as well as balsamic dressing done right. I also had the shrimp & grits, which had pinto beans. That was unique, but flavored well and the shrimp were large and w/out a tail. A vegetarian option that subbed mushroom for shrimp was available. My friend had the duck confit and was pleased. Their butter for the bread was a bit salty. Service was great, as the waitress had an impressive command over an expansive menu. Drinks were tasty, but weak. Overall, I see why this place is hyped. Everything was really flavorful and made from quality ingredients and the service is second to none.",

The restaurant and decor looks very dated, the atmosphere is not what I was expecting at all. We got drinks at custom shop ahead of time and it was a huge difference in atmosphere and feel. With some minor lighting and decor updates to match the quality of the food, this would easily be one of the best restaurants in town all around.",

I ordered the venison and she ordered the scallops for our entrees. Both entrees were nice, although I personally preferred the scallops. The salads were great as well. Conveniently located in the Elizabeth area of Charlotte with warm vibes and decor. Enjoy!",

    "text": "We came for Restaurant Week back in January.   We parked in street parking which was very convenient considering the lot nearby was very full.  The restaurant itself was very nice looking with a very large bar and seating area.   It's dimly lite in there which leads to a nice ambiance. We were seated in the back of the restaurant at a nice little table for 4.   We were first given a basket of bread and butter. The bread wasn't anything to write home about, but I like when there is a bread basket.   As we looked over the menu for Restaurant Week and ordered drinks - the waitress filled our waters up.   Due to Restaurant Week, we were working off of a paired down menu, but unlike other restaurants during this week the options were still great.   I ordered the warm goat cheese salad as my salad starter. It was delicious, very fresh and the warm goat cheese was cooked to perfection. Just enough ooze!   For my entree I ordered the Scottish salmon which had a Mediterranean take on it. The labneh served with it was divine!  For dessert i ordered the chocolate cake with caramel icing and salted toffee popcorn. This is an unusual order for me as I do not like chocolate cake, but something about it sounded good-- and I was right! It wasn't too overpowering or heavy like a lot of chocolate cakes.   All in all I was pleasantly surprised with Carpe Diem and I look forward to coming back and dining outside of restaurant week!",

While I did not get the buttermilk chicken - one of my friends did - and OMG, it looked and tasted amazing.  If we go back, that's what I'm ordering.  Now, the bad.  Prior to the entrees, we were served a cleansing sorbet (awesome right?).  However, the \"kid\" just set them down in front of each of us - not explaining what it was/the flavor/or anything.  Was just odd.  I ordered the Prince Edward Island Steamed Mussels and the Local Duck Wings as an entree.  I love mussels but thought I needed more than just that for dinner - hence the wings.  Both require the use of fingers and can get messy/sticky pretty easily.  I expect a nice restaurant to offer a warm towel towards the end of my meal to clean my hands - come on, even Buffalo Wild Wings gives me wet naps!  But, no such towel.  I ended up pouring some water from my glass onto my napkin and hitting up the restroom.    Prices weren't bad (including beer/wine prices).  Service was good for the most part.  A good restaurant in Elizabeth, but could be better.",

The service was divine!  This was my first time and the waitress was helpful with the menu.  I got the filet cooked medium...even that was a little too under cooked for me, which it isn't usually..so I had to send it back, but after that it was delicious.  The o my thing I didn't like was my dessert...it was so dry and awful that I don't even remember what is was.  One bite and done...maybe a bread pudding?  Ugh..either way...glad it was forgotten and a positive experience remains.  I would love to come back here and try some of the other delectable entrees!!",

Carpe Diem is a great place to celebrate a special occasion, and definitely a restaurant worthy of taking out-of-town guests for an evening out. Come here most night during the week and you'll have a quiet, intimate dining experience. On weekend nights this place can get a little loud, but not boisterous or obnoxious.",

    "text": "I picked this restaurant for a business dinner based upon the reviews and was not one bit disappointed. My colleagues and I were in town for a big meeting the next day with a customer here.   We parked across the street in the lot designated for the shops/restaurants and had to drive around for a few minutes before finding someone leaving to get a spot. Immediately made me think we'd be in for a wait in a very busy restaurant.  Not the case at all! We definitely walked into a busy restaurant but they immediately took us to our table to be seated. Sometimes even with reservations you'll have a wait at really popular restaurants but it was a pleasant and unexpected surprise to not have that here; especially given the packed parking lot.  We were seated at a corner table by the windows which was nice as it provided a relatively quiet environment for us to discuss our customer visit for the next day and plan everything out.   Service was immediate as well and spot on. No empty water glasses, no \"where'd the waiter go?\", no wondering if we would ever receive food. Drinks brought promptly, excellent staff! Spot on service.  The food was fantastic!! Met every bit of the high bar set by other reviewers. We tried a variety of things at our table and all thought what they ordered was spectacular. I'd point them out but given we ordered a pretty broad spectrum of their offering I'd just recommend that you go with whatever sounds best to you because I don't think any are going to disappoint.   They also had a decent wine list with a mix of both French, Italian, Spanish, California, and Oregon wines. Several beer on tap options. Full bar.  If I lived here this place would definitely be at the top of my list of dining out options.",

The Decor is warm and elegant without being intimidating. You can have a nice conversation without having to raise your voice to be heard. The service is attentive and professional and not snooty like in other upscale restaurants. Now the best part, the food. The prices are equivalent to the quality of the food. The portions are not as small as in other upscale restaurants, where you pay a lot and get tiny portions. All the dishes we ordered were perfectly made and very tasteful. Palate cleanser: sorbet before main entree, nice touch that many upscale restaurants forgo. They have a great selection of wine, served in nice wine glasses, not in clunky wine glasses. The experience at Carpe Diem was more like what you get and expect at a restaurant in Greenwich Village, NY. Can't wait to come back!",

The waitress was also very rushed and when I asked if the Mushroom Bolognese had shiitake in it (I stated I was allergic) she sort of shrugged her shoulders..and said something to the effect of \"it should be fine/I don't think so.\"  The person I was with more firmly stated I was allergic since she bypassed the question and took that down as my order anyway.  She went to the kitchen and came back to let us know it did have shiitake....  close call for me.  I ordered the salmon (medium) instead and it was very much overcooked.  Then the bill came with items not ordered on it... which I hope were better than my salmon.  TL; DR Rushed service, overcooked entree, and a blase attitude towards food allergies.",

Then we sat..  and sat... and sat...  and got some bread... then sat...  then we ordered!  when looking at the menu. their are not a lot of choices, so we figured that every choice had to be amazing.. because the reviews and such were so good.  we got the flat bread pizza with goat cheese and other stuff.. it was pretty good and i thought we were back on track.. we order the beef filet and the fried chicken for dinner.  the beef we wanted \"well\".. when it came out it was all pink.. so we sent it back. when it came back it was still pink...  Even the waitress (who was great and nice) was like this is wrong and not well...  but i was not about to send it back for a 2nd time..   so we kept it.  the fried chicken was good.. but i have had better.. To be honest Prices chicken or Macs beer can chicken is better.. and for the price we paid i was expecting it to be better..... and even though they were really good, mash potatoes are still mash potatoes..  because it was my birthday and the filet mix up..the waitress gave me crem brulee. which was a great desert.  Overall it was just a big ball of \"ok\".. The waitress was fantastic and nice.. our bill was 68$ so i gave her 80$ total.  but for 80$ i feel i could have found better food that was prepared a bit better.  Overall i would probably not eat there again.  no reason to spend 80$ on a big ball of \"OK\"  Disclaimer:  I recently moved here from NY (within the last 6 months)..  so maybe my thoughts are different than what it is down here.",

We showed up at about 8PM and were promptly asked by the host \"Do you have reservation?\".  No.  It's Monday.  There were 6 other people in the restaurant.  Why even ask if we had reservations?  The decor looks a bit dated.  I was expecting a pretty hip joint, instead got a old fashion restaurant.  Pretty bright too.  Some might find it charming.    Started off with some martinis.  I asked for extra dry, got a pretty wet vodka martini.  Fine, whatever.    Appetizers were probably the low point of the night - The seared tuna was about average (although pretty small).  The beef carpaccio left a lot to be desired.  While it was tender, it feel apart on us.  You HAD to use the fried wonton skins to eat it.  I love carpaccio, but the asian theme with it just didn't fly with me.   The main course was nice.  I had a grilled chicken breast with black rice.  I would order it again if I went.    Didn't order dessert.  Wine - We ordered a pretty expensive bottle of red wine.  The bottle was really warm - disappointing.  It should have been at least a little bit chilled.   I'll go back if someone is paying, but probably won't go on my own.",

Don't see how anyone can go wrong here.  It is a quieter restaurant, but easily handles groups and parties with reservations.  I'm making myself hungry to go right now!

We had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Breast and the Mountain Trout which was the catch of the day in seafood. We had a lovely evening.

    "text": "Yes, 5 stars for this wonderful restaurant. It's now one of my Charlotte favorites and I'd urge readers to seize the day (ok, had to say it!) and give my new fave a try.  The atmosphere is lovely - white tablecloth service, beautiful oversized floral paintings/photos adorn the walls, polished wood throughout and faux flickering candles on the tables. A low murmur could be heard throughout the room but it was not overpowering (not a fan of noisy restaurants).  The service is outstanding.  Attentive, smiling, helpful and friendly from the host staff to the wait staff.  And the food?  Heavenly.  I went with a group of 6 and all were unanimous in praise of their meals.  Warm sourdough bread with sweet butter that melted in my mouth was a good place to start.  If you like goat cheese, you'll want to try the warm goat cheese salad with apricot jalapeno vinaigrette dressing. The goat cheese is encrusted in hazelnuts and the flavor and texture are outstanding.  For an entree, I ordered the pork chop prepared medium (first time in years I've had a pork chop and I was a bit nervous to try).  Marinated in apple cider and grilled, served with a divine jalapeno and goat cheese cornbread pudding and carrots, this was a pork chop for the ages.  Oh my goodness...I'm serious here though a bit effusive.  It was really that good.  Even better was the cornbread pudding and some type of salsa verde on top that brought all the flavors of the meal together.  I would order it again were it not for my desire to try every other selection during my next visit.  Which will be very soon.  Dessert selection was Belgian chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce.  This is my favorite combination of dessert flavors and it was quite good.  I skipped my normal girlie martini so can't report on the skill of the barkeep here but the wine list had very good selections and thankfully I chose well on this evening.  Enjoy great food?  Add Carpe Diem to your list!",

    "text": "Fantastic meal with impeccable service and decor that would leave Alphonse Mucha green with envy.  Confronted with a hunger and desire to take advantage of restaurant week, we showed up on a Friday night around 5 without a reservation and was--amazingly--able to get a seat at a small table in the bar area.  Bread, service, and water came quickly from the attentive and friendly staff. After ordering we were attended to just the right amount: not too pushy, yet not absent.  While enjoying the bread, which is fabulously fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, we soaked in the ambiance: romantically lite room, beautiful woodwork, and mesmerizing back-lit vines.  For the first course, we shared two salads, the goat cheese  and the grilled grape. Both are fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the blue cheese vinaigrette on the grilled grape, which only hints at its blue cheese roots.  Next, we had the (famous) buttermilk fried chicken and vegetarian cous cous. Again, both were wonderful. The chicken was slightly battered and fried, which was a refreshing contrast to to more traditional fried chicken. The cous cous is a cornucopia of veggies and, well cous cous, in a light tangy sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Both are highly recommended.  Finally, dessert involved sharing a walnut and pecan pie (delicious, but I like my desserts like I like my chocolate--with chocolate) and a chocolate (yay!) bread pudding. The latter earned a paragraph unto itself.  Through years of diligent research, I've reached the conclusion that many chocolaty cake desserts are a let down. They are either not moist enough, too sweet, not sweet enough, too much, or just not satisfying. Yet still, time after time, I trepidatiously order the chocolate whatever in hopes that somehow, this time would be different. Usually, I am let down. However, this time at Carpe Diem it was different: this was the perfect mix of chocolaty goodness delivered via an appropriately moist vehicle for facilitating the devouration (yes, I just made that word up) of said chocolatly goodness (the bread pudding). I realize my error has always been relying on the traditional 'cake' delivery method. No longer. If ever you get the chance, you need to devourate (oops, I did it again) this chocolate bread pudding  In a final note, there is the bar area and the official dining area. We actually preferred the bar area on account of the lighting and more intimate nature of the experience. Still, the dining area has beautifully crafted art nouveau woodwork, a flower centerpiece, and wonderful artwork. I would return just to admire the place.",

First of all, the ambiance is awesome - cool back-lite vine and flower designs all around the bar area along with arch-shaped ceilings in the main dining room with crazy windy metal vines and flower lights.  The service was perfect.  My water glass was never less than half full and all of the food arrived in a prompt, well timed order.  There was always someone there to check on us, but not in an intrusive way.  The food was delicious!  The bread is fresh, warm, flaky on the outside, and soft on the inside.  I started with the hazelnut goat cheese salad which was amazing.  Then I had the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and spinach for my entree.  Apparently this is one of their most popular dishes, and I can see why.  The chicken was battered and fried to perfection and covered with a light, flavorful gravy.  The chicken was served on the mashed potatoes and wilted spinach.  Surprisingly, the dish did not feel heavy, like most fried chicken entrees.  I ended with the chocolate-carmel bread pudding for dessert - it was also awesome!  Nice and warm and gooey with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  The waitress told us about 1/2 off wine bottle and appetizer specials during the week - so I definitely will be going back to Carpe Diem!!!  If you are looking for a quiet, romantic, intimate setting for a date, this is the perfect place!",

    "text": "I dined at Carpe Diem during restaurant week with a group of 7 others.  The goat cheese salad featured some tasty onions and tart goat cheese, but the dressing was lacking in flavor and it definitely didn't live up to the expectation that several \"yelpers\" had set.  The salmon entree was spot-on, and the relish topping popped with incredible flavor.  Finally, the chocolate pudding was decadent and the perfect end to the meal.    My only complaint was the service.  Our waitress appeared to be in a less-than-enthusiastic mood from the start.  She rushed our drink orders within 30 seconds of being seated, required that we order appetizer, entree, and dessert all at once, failed to refill drinks, and then made errors on our receipts.  I love enjoying a fancy meal out, but there is simply nothing more frustrating than sub-par service.

The bartender was our waitress & she was awesome & truly nice. The food was good (House Salad, Filet of Beef, Pork Cutlet, Red Pepper Soup, Madonna Riesling) but not good enough to go back & be treated rudely.

The interior looks like it's been there forever, maybe as some old, upscale law firm or church, but it's also updated and modern, and you spend the meal trying to figure out how to update your house to look exactly like this.  The prices signify that this will be a celebratory meal, but it also isn't too expensive that you couldn't just be celebrating a darn good Wednesday.  And the level and quality of service is impecable.  Our waitress asked if we had somewhere we needed to be after dinner and if there was a certain time we needed to be out of there by - perhaps my date's tuxedo tipped her off?  Regardless, she kept us on schedule and (we realized when she brought it) had even tagged the check with our goal departure time.  As we left the restaurant, I looked at the clock and realized we were 5 minutes ahead of the time she wrote down; now that's service.  With the stage set now for a great evening, the food doesn't disappoint.  My boyfriend and I each ordered the goat cheese salad, which had a surprisingly sweet and spicy kick from the jalapeno apricot dressing.  For our entrees, he got the duck, which was slightly pink, succulently juicy, and perfectly topping a mouthwatering sweet potato polenta.  Are you drooling yet?  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, and I almost proposed to it, it was that good.  There's no \"if you love something, set it free\" mentality here; I scraped up the last little tidbits with a smile on my face.  By the time dessert came, I could barely finish my chocolate caramel bread pudding, but I tried my best; although I was nearly married to the fried chicken, I'd consider taking the bread pudding as a lover.    Carpe the experience, and enjoy!",

As you might imagine, the food is to die for.  That said, save room for dessert.  You have to try the creme brulee or something on the dessert menu anyway - it is all amazingly delicious!    That said, a few things I would I would highly recommend: make reservations since Carpe gets busy and plan out your parking strategy before you get there.  I really mean it about the parking because if you go on a day when it is busy, you will search and search for legal parking.  Nothing will spoil a night more than finishing a wonderful dinner only to discover you have a ticket or your car has been towed.  My car was safe on this visit - thank goodness.",

    "text": "We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth.  We tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner.  Big Mistake. While granted, it was a Monday night (I get that in the restaurant industry), the food was pretty much awful.  Over-seasoned...overdone. Steak overcooked; Quail undecipherable in it's bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce.  Wine overpriced. Salad uninteresting and dressing was boring.  Appetizer meatballs....well, regular meatballs without pasta. The descriptions were nice but the food didn't live up to it.  They had our table decorated (for our anniversary) but didn't offer a glass of wine, an appetizer , nor a dessert for our special occasion.  Expensive and um...\"let's just go home and have a glass of wine.\" kind of night.",

We made reservations and when we got there they were right on top of things taking our jackets and had the table ready. What was kind of a downfall was it literally took us 20 mins just to place an order for drinks so with all that time we just went ahead and placed our orders as well.   The bread and butter was pretty good. Our appetizer was the beef carpaccio, it was pretty good a different taste but not bad.   I ordered the Pork Chop it was a good but nothing amazing. I wasn't blown away from it like everything states. My wife got the buttermilk fried chicken but she said it also wasn't anything amazing.  For \"fine\" dinning the prices aren't bad and it is a nice place for a date night. Good spot and location.   I don't know if I went in there with high expectations or not, but overall it was an ok spot nothing extremely amazing. But I would go back later on down the road.",

    "text": "We went to Carpe Diem recently while visiting my family in Charlotte. We were really excited to eat here based on all the great things Yelpers had to say. The decor was nice, but nothing really special and it seemed a little generic to me. The service was ok as well, but again, nothing special.   We started with splitting the Warm Goat Salad and it was pretty good. We also ordered the Beef Carpaccio, and again it was good but nothing memorable. We also ordered the Cheese Plate but it never came to the table and we did not mention anything about it. It wasn't on our check so either the waitress didn't hear us order it or she forgot to put it in. For the entree I ordered the Filet of Beef and my wife ordered the Pork Chops which were the special the evening we went. Both were good and  I really enjoyed the red beet gnocchi that came with the steak. My mother ordered the friend chicken and it was amazing...def. the best thing I tried.   Overall I liked this place but just don't agree with most people who seem to think it's as good as it gets. The prices on the menu are very reasonable for a fine dining restaurant so that is a definite plus. I also like that they source from local farms. I don't know that I would jump at the chance to come here again...but wouldn't be opposed to it either.",

It was incredible. My only complaint is that I wished there was more.  And then dessert came... our waitress, who was very friendly and personable, informed us that one of the sisters that owns the restaurant also makes all the desserts and they change pretty frequently.  That night my fiance got what he calls the 'best thing he's ever eaten' which was a pumpkin gingerbread trifle (I believe) with caramel sauce.  I had the blueberry cobbler which was also really really good.  Overall, we loved this place and can't wait to go back the next time we are in the area!",

    "text": "Mothers Day brunch was somewhat disappointing. Our waitress was great and our salads and fried chicken entrees were very good. However, the shrimp and grits entree was entirely too small...The crepe was OK AND one small almost mini dry/dense cupcake per person was so disappointing.   If your party had four people, your table would receive 2 lemon and 2 chocolate small/mini cupcakes...most people at our table wanted choc, but only half of us got one. I'm sure we could have asked for all choc, but really..   This menu, in my opinion, was not worthy of a special occasion like Mothers' Day and certainly not worthy of a $30 price per person. I can get a salad, fried chicken entree, and mini cupcake for less than $30 just about anywhere.",

From the very beginning you can tell this is a great date night spot and my girlfriend and I were given a nice little two person table to help complete that scenario perfectly.  The food wasn't short of fantastic.  It was expertly prepared and plated very nicely upon presentation.  I was pretty impressed with all things, from the salad through the desert.  From looking over the menu I could tell this place has some very unique dishes that the chef staff has taken great care in putting together.  The service was great also, very specific and friendly service really helped finish the entire dining experience.  I will certainly be back to try it again.",

    "text": "Carpe Diem was another selection for Summer Queen's Feast this year. I started my meal warm goat cheese salad (with wine poached onions, hazelnut crusted goat cheese, mixed greens and an apricot jalapeno vinegarette). I can't say no to warm goat cheese and it's rich, creamy texture; so was a bit disappointed that the feature of the dish, the goat cheese, was quite sparse (only two goat cheese, for lack of a better term, balls, adorned my salad). While I liked the concept of the crusted goat cheese, the crust was not quite crisp, and the texture felt like it needed a few more minutes of cooking.   For my entree, I order the maple sorghum glazed hanger steak, which came with farro, vegetable pilaf and pickled fennel. This was an elevated comfort dish; the steak came nestled on the farro and veggies, and the flavors of all three complimented each other. The steak was cooked to my liking (rare, though the middle was a tad warm if we're splitting hairs); and was so incredibly juicy that I probably could have used a butter knife for slicing. However, the maple glaze was a bit sweet, and overpowered some bites to where I couldn't taste the meat and left a candied aftertaste in my mouth. As a self-proclaimed red meat connoseiur, it was a delicious and delightful steak, and I would wholeheartedly recommend the dish.  At this point of the meal, I was proud of myself for wearing a highwaisted dress, because I felt like I was going to burst at the seams. Luckily, I have a sweet tooth and can always make room for dessert. For dessert, I ordered the coconut cream pie, which came highly recommended by our waitress, and she definitely knew what she was talking about. My slice of pie was decorated with salted caramel sauce and strawberries, and while I was a bit hesitant about the sweet, on sweet, on sweet, it totally worked and I ate the whole thing. The brightness and sweetnes of the fresh strawberries enhanced the coconut, and the caramel provided just the right amount of salty balance. It is one of the best desserts I've had at a restaurant!
