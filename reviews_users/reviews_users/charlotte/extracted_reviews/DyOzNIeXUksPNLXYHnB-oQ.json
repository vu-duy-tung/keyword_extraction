I raved and raved about the pineapple salsa in my last review, but on this trip it wasn't nearly as good.  I could tell immediately that the color was different.  The first time we went it was white and looked almost like queso.  It was chilled and sweet with a touch of heat.  This past time it was the color of applesauce and SUPER spicy.  I mean, really really spicy.  The good news is that we know they must make it fresh.   We will be back!  Those nachos look like heaven.",

Not totally in love with everything on the menu here (surprisingly!), but there are a few must-try's: Get the Elote Loco (Mexican street corn), it's amazing!!! Just make sure you order a few so that you don't have to share. The Carne Asada fries: delicious! I can't believe we are here a few times before discovering these, but they're now my go-to. The steak is really tender and the toppings are perfect. I always ask for extra cotija cheese, and I eat them immediately or they get soggy. Margaritas: need I say more?  Word to the wise: this place gets CRAZY on taco Tuesday, so either come early or be prepared to wait even if you're getting take out!",

Prepare for things to get hectic, even later in the evening. It's hard to say when that sweet spot is on Tuesdays, but I've seen things die down once you get closer to 9:00 PM. When it's crowded, I highly recommend snagging one of the two outdoor tables if you're able.  Your veggie taco will fall apart, but the black bean, chicken, and beef tacos keep together pretty well. We always get the queso - great consistency and flavor, my favorite in town. Order a large queso, you'll get your chips for free.   I've enjoyed the arepas and the quinoa avocado bowl in the past, but I tend to stick with the tacos. There's plenty I haven't tried yet that looks delicious - I'd love to try the carne asada fries next.   The salsa bar and beer selection are great. Lots of local bear choices!",

Not sure whether it's the changing of staff behind the counter, streamlining of ingredients, or ever growing line, but Sabor is falling short on the authentic Latin food it has always provided. Not to say that it isn't great they're achieving more success than ever before as a chain, just hopeful that Sabor's expansion and franchising won't change the qualifying of the food any more than it already has.",

The guac was good, the queso just your basic queso. The salsa bar's hot red sauce was AWESOME but the salsa verde, while hot, also lacked in flavor.

It's hard to tell what's what in the bag and it may or may not all be there so dining in is best. Seating is limited and it gets busy. Worth a try for the money!",

    "text": "I finally made it to Sabor and overall was pleased.  Having never been I wasn't sure what to get so I may have ordered the wrong thing, however, it was good.  I was debating between a 3 and 4 starts, however, based on the shredded chicken I am going with a 4.  I ordered the Taco Salad with extra pico and shredded chicken. It comes with rice on the bottom, lettuce, pico, cheese, sour cream and cilantro. They also include bean, refried or black, however, I chose to get the beans on the side. And, the refried beans, so fresh and smooth. I absolutely loved.  Overall I was satisfied with my choice, but after seeing the photos on Yelp and the others diners around me I am going to have to get back to try a taco and definitely an arepa.  Downfalls, there was a longer wait then I expected with only a few other diners at the same time and the chips were stale, and the seasoning just tasted bad, like they were day old or something. Definitely nothing to be excited about, although I did get them free for \"checking in\" on Yelp. I look forward to getting back again soon and will update my review on the other menu items.",

We ordered the elote, guac and chips, three tacos and an arepa. I also had a Paloma because it's Saturday!   The corn was good; it always hits the spot. The guac has tomato in it - beware. I'm not a big fan of tomato in my guac because it makes it watery. I would order the shrimp taco again - soft and generous. The al pastor was good - it has pineapple, not just the basics. I didn't really make it to the steak taco (see above). I nibbled on the meat and it was spicy. It tastes like all the meats are spiced with different blends not just taco seasoning. I would say the highlight of the visit was the arepa. Get that, an order of elote and a shrimp taco.   They have a ton of canned beers - local and import. NoDa and Corona sit side by side. There are a couple other cocktails - I was surprised they had cocktails at all. If you can call a drink in a plastic cup at a taco place a \"cocktail\".   Not bad for a Saturday afternoon but nothing too fancy to write home about.",

There was a lot of items I wanted to try based off of many great reviews but for my first visit I ordered 2 authentico tacos. 1 with steak and 1 with al pastor pork... The steak was amazing !! And the pork wasn't that bad. I also ordered a side of rice and refried beans.  The atmosphere was great, the music had me dancing in line and the employees were friendly. I can't wait to go back and try more favorites !!",

No matter which way you go, this super-casual, family friendly joint in Elizabeth is the perfect spot to dive into some delicious Latin grub, try a great local brew, and fill up at what may be the best salsa bar in Charlotte.    On a recent visit with the family, I played it safe with the fantastic Sabor Especial Burrito, while the kids dove into a pair of cheese quesadillas. The chips were warm and crisp, and our entrees packed with flavor. The house margarita was just OK, though -- next time I'll grab a beer from their extensive selection of local craft brews.   There are six Sabor Grills in the Charlotte area, including a new spot opening soon near SouthPark Mall. With great food at reasonable prices, I think we're gonna be regulars.",

I can say that in comparison to the Indian Trail location, which I've been to more often, this Sabor has a much nicer environment and ambiance. The only detractor I can find when comparing the two locations is that this Sabor calls your name and you have to retrieve your food, while the Union County location brings your food directly to your table.  I still find the meats to be under-seasoned, so that must carry across Sabor as a whole. Not a dealbreaker by any stretch of the imagination, but I do wish they relied on sauces and salsas less and seasoned their proteins more aggressively.  Oh, and definitely check in on Yelp when you arrive -- get your free chips and crunch away.",

This particular time, I chose to go the americanized route and get the taco salad. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make a salad literally melt in my mouth. How does one do this. Still struggling to figure this out. Everytime I come here it reminds me that I need to come here more often. There's a big menu to try, and I can't wait to try more.   Pro-tip: Check in with Yelp and get an order of chips on the house :)  Another pro-tip: The nachos are probably the best deal in Charlotte.

    "text": "Why only three stars? Well, it starts at 1 star when I walk in. The atmosphere is bleak. No one greets you and the employees are drab and unhappy. Also the parking is terrible!   They earned a second star for having a robust menu, and for having a taco Tuesday... but I will come back to that later. The menu was well versed and seemed to be in line with what they claim to offer.  I ordered a fish taco for $3.75 and an chicken empanada for about another $3. I was thinking for the price, I would get a large portion and a side. Nope... No side, that was extra, and the portion... well, meh. The fish taco is the same size as the \"taco Tuesday\" taco, regular size. Small corn tortilla with the meat and dressings. The problem is the price, for $3.75 I would expect two, or complemented with a side item. maybe it's just me. So for a bargain go on tuesday when you wont feel as ripped off by the price. The empanada however is a decent size.  The flavor of the chicken in the empanada was pretty good. The salsa (green monster) was good. And the fish taco was flavored well! They earned a third star for flavor. But they nearly lost it based on the fact my empendada wasn't cooked all the way through. I assume (and hope i am wrong) that it was made before hand, like the night before, then deepfried or deepfried prior and microwaved. I had parts of the empananda that were cold. And no, you can't tell me it was due to it setting out. I waited all of 5 minutes from placing the order to receiving. The size of the taco was small, and it was consumed in three maybe four bites. The empanada sat on my tray for no more than 3 minutes, while in my possession. Logically thinking, even if it was done first, the internal temp. should be kept for an extended period of time, if it was in fact deep fried.  Well, there you have it; a strangers review. I hope another location is better. Maybe I caught them on an off day. I will give them another try, but I don't expect much change. Overall, the flavor and menu selection is good, but the price is a tad high and staff and environment remind me a of a school lunch room.",

    "text": "My favorite street Latin food in Charlotte. They combine the richest of Latin spices and herbs to make tasty savory dishes. The arepa is filled with aromatic chicken and generous chews on a soft maze dough. The Dominican nacho is my daughter's favorite dish. I love their selection of salsa sauce. The green monster sauce truly satisfy my level of spiciness. Each dish here is very aromatic and always delicious. I like their avocado dips very much also. This is surely a place to go if you crave for street Latin food.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of this place and it's not solely because of the food. During my last visit I used the the $7 for $10 yelp special and the free chips check in.  For $7 I got two tacos authenticos, a veggie empanada, a side of guacamole, a huge bag of tortilla chips, and about 5 different salsas from the salsa bar. Wow. It was about  2 meals worth of food.  Love that Sabor has a private parking spot not too far from uptown. All food is made to order making it a perfect lunch spot.   The inside is a little wonky. Not really decorated, an old building, nothing really special. They have $4 mojito specials on Thursday and other weekday specials (see photo).  Now for the food. I was a little disappointed with how dry and unflavorful the chicken in my tacos were but with enough salsas smothered on I was pretty delighted.  By the time I got to try the empanada it was a little oily/soggy which I cannot blame on Sabor, but was disappointing. Aside from the texture it tasted authentic and was very tasty.  The chips and guacamole were delicious! I swear the bag of chips was the same size as a tostitos bag.  Overall, 3.5 stars for food and 5 stars for convenience, value, and salsa bar. Ill definitely be returning to Sabor in the near future and I recommend you do as well.",

    "text": "Sabor is very capable of catering to my excruciatingly picky needs. As I am vegetarian my order does tend to be more complicated and many restaurants can get flustered and make awful errors in my food (looking at the noodle place that put small little bits of shredded chicken in my meal - like minuscule shreds - that I thought were other noodles. Not sure if mistake or just bitter chefs) that can make me sick or just make it take longer to get to my food because I send it back. Sabor employees are always willing to cater to my needs as far as altering my protein choices or anything else I request (within reason obviously.)   Today, though, they went over the top to take care of me. I was walking my dog down Hawthorne and got the hankering for Sabor as we passed. So, because I have a dog, I called in and got a very pleasant young woman on the phone. I asked if I could order on the phone and if so could someone bring my food outside so I didn't have to walk my dog the 1.5+ miles back to start and then drive back to get my meal. It was such a nice day outside anyway, I wanted to sit in the sun. They said absolutely and wouldn't you know it, 15 minutes later I have 2 tacos and a cheese-and-chili covered corn on the cob sitting in front of me PLUS a water bowl that they brought out for my sweet pup. I didn't think to ask, I was going to just give my puppy the cup of water I got for myself so I wouldn't bother the waitress helping me any further, but without my prompting this wonderful server brought a whopping bowl of water for my puppy so I could keep my own drink.   Sometimes there are slip ups and mix ups and it takes a little longer to get the food you ordered but it can happen at any restaurant to any server or cashier so it is entirely understandable. This restaurant is one of my all-time favorites and is certainly worth the price spent. I tell everyone I know to go to Sabor and I am so glad I work within a decent walking distance.  To the server whose name I forgot who was working today (2/7/2017) around noon that helped me - thank you so much! You were so kind and I appreciate how hard you work and all the effort you put forth into taking care of my puppy and I.  -Marissa",

    "text": "There are two places to get legit Mexican food in Charlotte. One is owned by a Mexican family with La Unica, the other is owned by hipsters with Sabor Latin Grill. Coming from South Florida, authentic Mexican food is one of the only redeeming qualities of the place, so having another option that pays respect to authentic Mexican food but with some unique twists is as refreshing as the Quinoa and Avocado bowl I'm currently shoving in my face. Both offer no compromise killer food, but Sabor is more low-key with a walk-up order counter while La Unica is a sit down affair. So that means no matter what mood you're in, you can always scarf down some solid Mexican chow.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars.....Rounded up to 4....but....  I was so looking forward to trying this place as I have not found a really great Latino restaurant here in Charlotte. Well I'm not sure if I have yet....but I'll say that sone thibgs at Sabor Latin Grill are quite good....others....meh.  The good: Saboritas! See related pic. Basically this is a crunchy taco sandwich. It so reminded me of the Mexican street fod I had growing up in a Mexican neighborhood in my hometown of Chicago. I had the steak and it was covered in a delicious cheese sauce with onions and other spices. The steak had a great flavor. This really is Latin Street food! Highly recommend this dish.  Also the chips were fresh and their salsa bar had some nice choices. But BEFORE your tongue ventures into eating any of the habanero dips get some SOUR CREAM to put that fire out!  Guacamole was very fresh and delicious!   The not so good: Quipe. This is basically a ball of deep fried meat. It's decent tasting but after a few bites I was like, ok....next? The accompanying rose salsa was reaaly good....reminded me of a Mexican version of that Japanese Yum Yum sauce. Very creamy and yummy....much better than the meatball.  Another MAJOR GRIPE is that the girl takung my order new very little about the food being served! Really? And half of the menu was not even available....no Gorditas nor Arepas! That's what I really wanted. Guess I'll try those next time.  So I'm still on a quest to find a truly GREAT Latino restaurant in Charlotte. Maybe Sabor is it....but the food has got to be available for me to even try it!  But their steak in any dish is really excellent!",

So there is an extensive menu of all kinds of things, burritos, tacos.. and huge nacho plates and other mex dish menu. As I was looking at the menu and the surrounding patrons I see that most of the best choice to get was tacos. LOL, not sure if it was on sale or what, but hey, I'll be part of the incrowd.  I got 2 beef and 1 chicken taco with a side of guac and cheese dip and their homemade salsa. The guac was so creamy and chunky with the fresh ingredients . I loved the embrace that this place has to cilantro. I LOVE cilantro. Tacos had them on it, and if you even wanted extra you can ask for it. The dips came with 1 bag of chips for each side. So be prepared to be overloaded with chips for easy dipping. The chips were great! They seemed to have some chili seasoning on them.   What make this place so unique than the others? THE SALSA BAR! You have such a huge choice lineup of different salsas depending on what you were in the mood for. There was super hot, hawaian and others that looked awesome. You can put as much as you want into tiny to-go cups for easy transport. **just don't take more than you can eat*  :)  I am highly impressed with this place, and I will be a returning customer, thanks for the great service.",

Last time, we split it between three people and it was perfect. Usually, I end up ordering it with 6 other things and can't finish anything -beware!  They have an exceptional craft beer selection, considering that its a taco join and not a beer bar. They also have specials throughout the week, so check their facebook to see what's going on.

They have tons of local and Mexican beers at your disposal for a great blend of culture's.  All the food ingredients are fresh, natural and ready to serve.

Place can be a little dirty and you see where people have sat and eaten. As well as temperature it's room temperature and no A/c. The place it has pretty good food selection to meet craving needs and can always be customized, taste very authentic than any other place I have gone in the Charlotte area. Drinks they serve beers and as well as variety of non alcoholic beverages. Definitely recommend this place.",

When I used my credit card to pay it automatically prompted for tip amount...15%-20%-etc. Which you pay In advance of receiving anything. You have to get up to get your food, drink, napkin,  salsa etc. The floor girl was very nice and was a get conversationist. Strange tho... she complained in front of my wife and I that people had left their trays and plates on the table instead of dumping in the trash can like taco bell.Thats what they expect you to do here. I gave 20% gratuity which is no big deal. Honestly tho...in a do-it-yourself service establishment you should not prompt for a tip prior to actually receiving it. It makes many feel ashamed not to add it up front. I mean the truth is you have to get up for drink refills etc. There really is no service.",

I order the tacos americanos and the queso and I received my free chips upon checking in there in Yelp, which was awesome!

Now, I don't have to drive the grueling 2 miles through Plaza Midwood to Three Amigos! I can even walk or ride my bike to this fantastic taco spot in the Elizabeth neighborhood. If you have never had a street taco (tacos autenticos) from Three Amigos and/or Sabor, stop what you are doing now and head on over. They are the best. Seriously the best, no expensive, fancy taco place can even compare. I couldn't even find a taco as delicious on my recent trip to Mexico (I blame the tourists)! These little, yet very filling (I recommend two) tacos come sprinkled with cilantro and diced onions plus perfectly cooked pulled chicken on a handmade corn tortilla, yes, please! I recommend two tacos autenticos, a side of chips and salsa and a Victoria or whatever you fave beer is. You will not be sad.   I used to teach Spanish, so I know my tacos (obvs!), this place rocks and you cannot beat it for the price and quality. Super quick service too.   BTW -- the style is order at the counter and they call out your order for you to pick up. Easy and laid back. Nothing fancy here.

Monday's at Sabor are $6 burritos and $2 Mexican beers. My husband and I play in a Monday  kickball league (don't judge) on that side of town and have been hitting up Sabor regularly for this special!  My burrito filling of choice is the quinoa brown rice, shredded chicken, refried beans, no queso (the queso makes the burrito but I have been watching my dairy intake). Honestly i have no idea if you can get other toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, corn, etc on it. It is always perfect as it comes so I never ask. Comes out in this big lump of goodness.   A burrito plus chips is enough for two but on this particular occasion, I had 14,000 steps for the day and 75 active minute so my fit bit told me to go for the whole thing....which I crushed. 2 burritos and 2 beers for 2 peeps. $16. That is winning in life.  Pro tip. Check in on yelp. Free chips and the salsa bar rocks!",

The battle continues.  Rule #1: make sure to check in on your Yelp app. They have an offer for free chips. I mean, your queso is going to need a bag of friends. And let's face it, queso is a must order. I like everything here, so my orders are all over the place. I love the empanadas and elote loco (corn). On Mondays, you can get a Three Amigos burrito and a drink for $6 (I always get ground beef). Taco Tuesday is one of the best deals in the city with $1 tacos authenticos. The nachos are the hidden gem menu item, they're massive.  I love their salsa bar. Salsa bars just make everything better, it's science. You can place pick up orders and pay online to speed up your to go process.   Only downfall of this place is the parking situation. The lot is small and it can sometimes be impossible to find a spot.

Chicken arepa... I've had a fresh blue corn arepa in Miami and this rubbery disk was barely edible.   Let alone the burnt flavorless chicken empanadas with a 1000 island tasting dressing. WHAT?!?   Everything lacked flavor--- we had to add ingredients from our fridge! Ie cilantro and pico!   When you are craving something and are excited and you're left hanging --- so disappointing!   I'd rather risk ecoli from chipotle!",

Both were fresh, but I couldn't deny was the fact it was pipen hot. Not spicy but just cooking Hot. So much so that it warmed me to my bones! Something needed on a cold night. The customer service was on point and the space was crowded but moved quickly a must try if you are in or near NoDa!",

The soda fringe was almost bare, The bathrooms were disgusting, and the staff seemed very inattentive. I really hope this was just a one time thing.",

This alone deserves 5 stars but I have a rule about partaking more than once before reviewing...which I had to break just to make sure everyone heard about these plugs.   We will be back on a Friday. For my first visit... I like it! Saniqua and Taryn are right on the money about this place.   The $1 tacos are flavorful and they don't skimp on portions simply because it's the deal of the day.   Self serve salsa bar.  You'll get trays so just wait until the tray is offered when they call your name then go fill up.  Oh the fountain drink cups are HUGGGEEEE.... or maybe I'm so used to 8oz of drinks for everything in most of Europe that I forgot how we can gorge ourselves in the US.  Either way, you can't go wrong here.  They didn't rush us to order being it was our first visit.  We were welcomed at the door and again at the counter.   Oh! bestest part: they have two entrances/exits which helps you beat some of that harsh traffic. Large lot but I'm sure it fills up quickly.",

They also serve alcoholic beverages; local craft beers from NoDa, popular name brand beers and some of their own house margaritas and mixed drinks.

    "text": "so glad I forced myself to come here after already eating dinner! My boyfriend and I were on a time crunch in charlotte and wanted to hit a bunch of food places plus it was Cinco de mayo so we had to get our taco fix.   What I love about the place is how it's fast casual but they still give you great service. They offer a lot of different options from arepas, tacos, burritos and even healthy options plus they have a variety of different local beers and margaritas that reasonably priced compared to most places.   I ended up ordering the shredded chicken arepa which was fuegoooooooo (emphasis on the fuego) the portion they gave was a lot bigger than the ones I've had in Virginia and came out so warm and fresh. The spices and cheese were so flavorful and the dough was cooked perfectly where it was slightly crunchy but had a soft inner part. I highly recommend! I just wish they offered a chicken arepa with an avocado filling.The tacos were so authentic tasting, it was just as great as the arepa! I ordered the steak and ground beef tacos and they were so flavorful you could tell they took time to season their meat. Eating it alone was really good but when you add their salsa it made it x10 more bomb! My favorite was the jalapeno green salsa it's really good if you like that extra kick! We ended it with churros and ice cream and honestly the churros were so mouth watering, perfectly cooked and they filled it with dulce de leche which was the game changer!!! The margarita too was really good even though it was low shelf, it was way better than Hot Tacos margaritas if you've ever eaten there in charlotte.   If you're ever in town or live in Charlotte, I would make this my go to for mexican food, the employees are sweet and genuinely care about their guest experiences. The guy who was going around cleaning up the tables was even really kind and kept checking how things were and if we needed anything and all the employees working seemed like they enjoyed working there.",

    "text": "No thrills here, just great food at a reasonable price. My wife and I have started dropping in here regularly on Mondays to take advantage of their $6 burrito special. It's approximately the size and weight of a small child - so come hungry! If the included drink doesn't float your boat, then go for the $2 mexican beers which are always a crowd pleaser.   I can't lie, if you haven't been into Sabor before the menu can be a bit overwhelming. You feel under the gun with rapid fire wait staff anxiously looking for your order and a cast of seasoned Sabor vets behind you impatiently waiting to input their order. Fortunately for you, most everything here is excellent. As mentioned above, the burritos are amazing. I prefer it over the taco tuesday deal to avoid the crowds. I also recommend checking in with your yelp app to get chips and test out all of the salsas at the salsa bar. It's one of the few places I can go with non regular menu items (for me) and feel confident I'll get a good meal I like.   Also as mentioned, good luck with parking. This isn't helped by all the construction on Hawthorne right now. Worst case go park in independence park, take a nice stroll, and enjoy the day. Hopefully this will get better soon!",

Instead, they call your name from the counter and you go grab your food. Either way, the food is so good. If you get the large queso, guac, or pico, you get free chips. And it's a lot of chips.   My favorite day is $1 taco Tuesday, obviously. You can add cheese for .20! Veggies are free, so I add cheese and lettuce, then add some verde salsa and it is amazing. I haven't had the nachos yet, but I've seen them come across the counter and they look great too. They don't hold back on the portion sizes so you definitely get your moneys worth no matter what you order.   My next stop is the newer one near Carolina Place Mall. I'm interested in how they operate over there since each one seems a little different. Regardless, if you're not hitting up Sabor once a week, you're missing out on some of the best that Charlotte has to offer.",

Advantages of this would be not having to wait for the server to come to you, and getting your food faster (of course?!!). The menu has a variety of items that range from street food, tacos, burritos, and more. I decided to get tacos, and they are priced at about $2.75 for one. For me, 3 filled me up. I got the grilled steak, chicken and al pastor tacos. I was a little skeptical about how good they would taste especially since the tacos only consisted of the protein, onion, cilantro and lime, but simple must be better in this case.   Even better news, there is a salsa bar! There are many different types of salsa and I recommend trying as many as possible. Mixing the salsa together on my tacos actually tasted pretty good. Also, when you check in on yelp, you get an order of chips so don't forget to do that! They are very generous in how many chips they give you. Even with a party of 4, we didn't even finish the basket. I highly recommend trying this place out, you will not be disappointed!",

I like the guacamole, mostly because its affordable (get the large and share with 4-5 friends) but I prefer mine without chunks of onion and tomato. Carne Asada Fries are decadent and amazing.

Ordering is just inside the door a few feet.  Pick up a cold drink from the cooler or order a fountain drink at the counter.  The menu is above the counter and consists of all sorts of latin american options.  I went with the Sabor burrito and an order of chips and guac.    The chips came out first.  Not really a fan of the seasoned chips but the guac was amazing with lime and tomatoes mixed in.    The burrito was huge and filled with rice, beans, flavorful pulled chicken and a few other things.  I topped it off with that wonderful hot green salsa from the salsa bar.  I was in heaven.  Definitely need to come back here!!!!",

The empanada crust was crispy with a soft filling of veggies. Both seemed very fresh.  I had the elote Loco corn on the cob. It had a nice blend of cream and sweetness.  My husband had the pastor taco served Loco. It was very large. Nicely spicy with a hint of pineapple.   The portions are generous and the prices are excellent. The have a solid beer selection too.  The salsa bar features 6 options ranging from mild to very hot.   Our favorite item was the arepa.  It is very casual and a little worn in.   The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. The did miss one item on our order, but they quickly corrected the omission.  We'll add this to our Charlotte go to list of lunch places.",

Fresh salsa bar, free chips when you check in (heyyyyy), consistently delicious food, what more could you want?

If a Mexican restaurant doesn't have good salsa, I'm not confident about the rest of the food.  At Sabor, they have a Salsa Bar, a la Phat Buritto, which I abhor.  For the salsa, they only have tiny paper cups, which are near impossible to dip chips in.  For dinner, I was eager to try their version of Mexican corn on the cob,  but they had run out of it earlier in the evening.  (It was only 7:30-8pm when I was there)  I ordered a Papusia instead, only to be shot down again, as this menu item was 86 as well.  I was able to get 2 Carne Asida tacos authenicos.  I assuemed wrong that I would be able to get them just as I like them at Three Amigos, but once again had to lower my expectations.  I like Queso Fresco sprinkled on my tacos, but the man taking my order said they \"didn't carry any cheese\" except for parmesian, which last time I checked was Italian?  How does a Mexican restaurant not have cheese?   The counter staff were all very friendly, and the man taking my order was very apologetic for the items I ordered that they were out of.  No need to go back, Three Amigos is closer to me, more charming, and heads and tails above their new sibling restaurant Sabor.",

After the Festival in the Park we went here for the first time as I'd seen a Groupon for it and checked out the menu and was super excited to take my aunt in from South America to try this \"authentic\" street tacos!  Boys was I EVER fooled!!!  First of all when I walked in to the restaurant it was absolutely FILTHY!!!  The person taking our order looked a little odd as well.  Not groomed, missing teeth and not that you should be dressed to the hilts when working with food but PLEASE at least look clean!  The kitchen where the food was prepped and cooked is open so you can see all what's going on...It was pure filth!  Not even sure how it had a 96% rating!  Despite the filth we ordered.  It was 6:30 pm when we came in.  My husband had ordered a margarita which 20 min. later still hadn't been served.  7:00 rolls around and the chips and guac (which by the way was super small serving for it's price) still hadn't been served as well.  So, I approached the man working behind the counter and he gave them to me shortly.  Still no margarita...After being there 30 min. I realized all these people who I'd noticed were there before us when we walked in were still seated...with no food.  I approached them and had asked them how long they'd been waiting and they both angrily replied 50 min.!  Still no food!  We had our 2 kids with us and on a school  night so was no way I could wait that long! So I asked the guy behind the counter if he'd even started our order yet an he hadn't.  He said they were out of a lot of their stuff and the owner had to come in on his day off to chop foods and help.  Well shouldn't the owner have his staff a little more representable when cooking foods we are eating?  Long story short we left and got refunded. And last but not least....will not be going back!  Also...forgot to mention there was a table that was abandoned with tons of food still on their plates with maybe 3 or 4 bites taken from each plate.  Like they took a bite or two found/tasted something horrible and were lickety split!  That should've been a huge red flag to us when we walked in the place.  Sooo upset, was really looking forward to a joint that had killer street tacos!",

I decided to keep the food for my roommate instead of returning it and reorder the burrito online.

    "text": "Visited last night, and let me tell you how much I loved it!   First of all, it is hidden in Elizabeth/Plaza Midwood and I never knew this place existed. My friend recommended it to me because she has been going here for years. I thought it would have been run down because the tacos were SO affordable, but surprisingly it wasn't!   I have NEVER seen taco Tuesday done so right, and boy was I impressed. It was only $1 for any type of taco, excluding the shrimp tacos. How could I turn that down? It was crazy because when I arrived I was first in line to order. All of the sudden I turned around and there were at least 20 people behind me. Whew, I am glad I arrived when I did!  The atmosphere was great and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I got the veggie, black bean, chicken, and shrimp tacos. They were so delicious and were cooked to my liking, authentic style. Also, I got chips that came with my meal for checking in on Yelp. I am so glad I received them because there was a salsa bar. The pineapple hot salsa was my favorite! Sweet and spicy.   I really enjoyed everything and could see myself coming here every Tuesday. I am so glad to have found a Mexican restaurant that I enjoy, conveniently within 5 minutes from my home. Please give this place a try if you haven't already!",

    "text": "I've had Sabor book marked for a while and since I was out and about and on that side of town I decided to stop in and finally give them a try.   The place is small, easy enough to find but definitely not fancy by any means. But they do have some outdoor seating which would be really nice when it gets a little warmer.   The ordering process is easy enough, the menu is listed on two large boards as soon as you walk in, and you simply place your order pay on the iPad and then wait for them to make it.   I have to admit that I was pretty bummed I missed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 3-5pm for $.99 tacos autenticos) but I found the prices here were pretty reasonable.   After a quick chat with the guy taking my order and telling him it was my first time and asking for some suggestions I ended up ordering two tacos authenticos (one chicken and one steak), a chicken empanada and an order chips and guacamole.   Yep. All that...don't judge me.   While I waited for them to get my order ready, I stopped by the salsa bar. It definitely didn't look like some of the pictures I've seen, a lot were either out or in squeezable containers but at least they had the super spicy green one that I'd heard was  super spicy and delicious. So I helped myself to a container of that and before I knew it my order was ready.   Tacos Authenticos: Classic. I preferred the chicken over the steak, but that's just my personal preference. I loved how all the flavors came together (especially the cilantro and lime juice). For an extra kick, add some of that spicy green sauce (which I'm sure has a proper name) and it's so good.   Empanada: Ok, first of all they are huge. Second they come packed with meat and fried up to golden perfection. And third, it was by far my FAVORITE part of the meal. My only complaint....I didn't order two.   Chips and Guacamole: The chips were seasoned and warm. I thought they were okay. And the guac was good, but nothing too special.   Did I mention they have margaritas?   I didn't have one this visit but you better believe that on my list of things to try when I return! Overall, I'd say this place is worth a visit.",

Let me tell you why the meal was so great!  My girlfriend and I had never been here before so we decided to just get a sample of a few things to start with to see what we liked. We ordered an empanada, an arepa, and one elote loco ear of corn. I didn't expect a lot of food for only $12, but by the end we were full and didn't want more than this initial \"sample\". The corn was good, but the arepa and empanadas were heaven! The chorizo empanadas (2 per order btw which we didn't know) had great flavor and the rosada dipping sauce was incredible. The arepa, however, was even better! The shredded chicken was so good, and all of the flavors just went together perfectly. The service was excellent, and they have a free salsa bar with 5-6 different salsas you can try (although everything was so flavorful we just ate them on the side but never on our actual food). The price and flavor are both on point, and I left extremely impressed.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Elizabeth neighborhood in Charlotte and to Sabor Latin Street Grill. Sabor in Spanish means flavorful, an apt description for this contemporary Latin restaurant.  Dora here. While we were eating, the line to order extended out the door. If you'd like a parking spot, get your act in gear and get there early. Their lot's small, but private off-street parking is always a bonus. Oh, and if you need to charge your device, the booths have USB chargers. Really? Wowza! Definitely not fancy or intimate, but awesome food. If you use the Yelp app, be sure to check in and get your free chips, which we totally forgot, but chips would've been overkill since Ernie ordered nachos. Oh, and try out the five or six salsas on their Salsa Bar, especially the Pineapple. You'd think sweet, right? Not sure I tasted anything sweet, nothing but pure fire. That stuff straightened my hair! lol.  For my lunch, I ordered the Supreme Nachos, a giant pile of tortilla chips, hamburger, refried beans, queso, lettuce, sour cream and pico do gallo. Now these were monster nachos and not a dish that could be finished by one person. The chips were crispy, it was loaded with hamburger, and all of the other ingredients worked perfectly together to make one great tasting dish.  The Elote Loco is corn on the cob lightly coated with mayo and covered with cotija cheese then dusted with chili powder. This corn was outstanding, a little sweet, with a creamy flavor from the mayo and a little spice from the chili powder.   Dora here. Best corn on the cob ever! Sweet, spicy, and every bite a different flavor. My favorite dish of the day. So many items on the menu, only so much time to eat! lol. Seriously, folks, we could've just shared that huge pile of nachos. But I'd been drooling over the pictures on Yelp, and with our limited weekend dining options, I knew that I wanted more than nachos. When I got to the front of the counter, I ordered the first two dishes that caught my attention, a Beef Empanada and a Chicken Arepa. With a crispy shell and a gooey, cheesy filling, the Beef Empanada was my second favorite dish on the table. The chicken arepa came overflowing with cheese and bundled in a soft, cakey shell. I wasn't quite sure how to eat it, but since it was wrapped in foil, I suspect you're supposed to pick it up. Hmmm. That didn't work for me as well as knife and fork. The rosada sauce (a blend of ketchup and mayo and other condiments) was cool and soothing after that crazy-hot pineapple salsa. When we make it back, I'm going for the Carne Asada Fries or the Build-Your-Own-Bowl. And maybe I'll remember to check in on Yelp to get the free chips for my pineapple salsa.   We debated the rating for Sabor Latin Street Grill. Immediately after every meal, we both offer up our ratings. Hubby planned to give them four forks, his argument being that ordering from the counter detracts from the experience. I agree that I prefer to order from the table, but was that one tiny aspect enough to drop them from a five fork rating to four? Since we started this food blogging venture, we have always based our reviews on the whole experience: quality of food, value, ambiance, service, etc. So, in line with that, we rate them four fork for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. (But it was really awesome!  )  How do you feel about restaurants where you order at the counter?

The creative pairings and spice combinations were delightful and will tickle your tastebuds leaving you breathless for more.   Would absolutely go again. Bravo. Bravo.",

The food is authentic, always accompanied by house-made salsas and sauces to add an extra kick.  I love that they offer a \"create your own bowl\" option at an affordable price. The Mexican rice as a base is delicious, filling and could almost stand alone with added veggies.  Each day they provide a special including $1 Taco Tuesday and $5 Margaritas on Friday. All specials are available on their website.   Heads up: - Parking can be a bit limited around rush hour times. The lot is quite small.  - Online ordering is available and my order is always correct. I work close by and often order and pick up with no issues. - The Elizabeth location is a bit small (but cozy). Probably not best for large groups.",

    "text": "I have ordered many times through Postmates/Door Dash from but finally got a chance to go on a Taco Tuesday.  Short version: Food is good, service is great, place is super casual and has parking. Would definitely recommend checking it out and would definitely return.  Long version: Sabor is a walk up to the counter to place your order type of place that does tacos (authentic and not authentic), Tortas (sandwiches), Burritos, and other delicious mexican inspired \"fast foods\".   My party and I ordered a variety of different tacos, Dominican nachos ( now called Yuca Sabrosa) , a Torta Riki Plantain and an Empanada.   My favorites where the Dominican Nachos, the shrimp tacos and steak Tacos Locos (has added chorizo). The veggie taco was not even worth ordering to be honest, there was nothing all that great about. The other tacos where good but I just really like the shrimp and steak ones. I order Al Pastor as well but they had no pineapple so I feel like the full flavor wasn't there. The Torta Riki Plantain was a Sandwich with fried sweet plantains and ground beef. It was good but not my thing...I was expecting a sandwich where the plantain was being used as the bread not that the plantain would be sandwiched itself but it was good. The empanada was also good. I was hoping it would be baked but it was fried...still tasty though.  A member of the party ordered the Elote and said it was amazing. A couple of people  ordered margaritas but did not like them at all.  Overall, the service was very friendly. All of the food was fresh. The staff keeps everything clean and seem to be very organized. Everyone was helpful regardless of whether we needed a cup for water or bags to pack up leftovers. Love this place and we totally return. My advice is to try out on another day that isn't Tuesday. I feel like when I have ordered food on other days, the flavor of everything was just slightly better.",

They also have really great deals during the week and daily taco happy hours. If it's your first time going, I would recommend you go on Thursday so you can get a large empanada and arepa for only $6. And if you go during happy hour between 3-4, you can get dollar tacos as well. It'll set you up for a really big and cheap meal where you can taste a little bit of everything. Their queso is also to die for!",

Nor do I need to as this place is rocking some Latin/Mexican fare!   It's small, cramped, apparently no AC, but once you get your food nothing else matters!  I had to get a plethora of things to sample so I went with a couple of tacos, both fish and pastor, a empanada, a arepa, and a dusted corn! The empanadas are just ridiculous!  The fried dough is obviously house made, filled with a ton of shredded stewed chicken, and perfecto cheeses! The arepa was similar without being fried, equally delicious, and with tomatoes! The fish tacos are rather large, or perhaps just filled to the brim, and just packed with great flavors and fresh fish! The pastor taco didn't lack meat either, and the first taste of the pastor has you wanting to get up to do a Mexican dance! Trust the nearly 600 reviewers and go get into your happy place!",

The portions are big and guaranteed to leave you with some leftovers to take home. I would recommend the nachos or the arepas. It's not expensive so it works if you're not looking to spend too much.

I came with some friends and this was our first time here so we just talked to the cashier a bit just to get a feel of the menu and what he recommended. We still got tacos because that's what we came for, but there are many other menu items I want to come back and try! I got 2 Shredded Chicken tacos, 2 Grilled Beef, and 1 Grilled Veggies. The food came out pretty quick, as the chefs were workin' real hard for the bustling crowd and cranking out taco after taco. I loved the grilled beef and shredded chicken but the grilled veggies were not that good. It had this weird taste in the veggies and I just did not like it. There is limited seating and it's very tight so it gets a little overwhelming. Also, parking SUCKS. I ended up parking in the neighborhood and walking.   Funny story, I was sitting down about to eat and I stood up to take a picture if the tacos. Right when I did, sweet tea shot at my seat and all over my boots   Another customer was trying to get sweet tea when the spigot fell off so sweet tea shot out everywhere. Luckily the staff was extremely quick to save the sweet tea and the customers from the potential disaster. The kind guy who was our cashier from earlier apologized because he knew it was our first time and was sorry this happened! It was okay though and quite a fun experience and I really appreciated him for saying that because it shows that they have good customer service.",

They have *enough* vegetarian options but they're definitely not the most imaginative I've seen. I actually prefer their roasted veggie tacos to the tofu options because I think the flavoring is better. But rest assured if you're meat free, you have some options here! Not sure about how vegan it can be, though.  I do think their prices are a tad high for what you get; I'm always a little surprised at the total price. But it's still undeniably more affordable than the multitude of fancy Mexican/Latin restaurants around Charlotte. And way faster and probably more authentic.  If you're looking for fast, cheap, authentic tacos, this is a great spot for you!",

    "text": "Finally tried this place over the weekend for lunch. I really wanted to like Sabor more than I do. For one, it's close to my home. Secondly, I appreciate ethnic food, and this is pretty authentic (at least for Elizabeth).  The joint was blasting latino music, I almost felt like I should dance a little. It's happy music in my ears, granted I have 2 left feet when it comes to latin dancing. I wanted to try something new, so I opted for the Arepas ($4.50). Checking in got me some free chips, so I ordered a side of guacamole as well ($1.25). And by side I meant a condiment plastic cuppy size.  They did pack quite a bit of guacamole in that small thing. While it tasted fresh, it was a little bland. Could use some salt/seasoning. The arepas came out piping hot, like burning fingers hot. The corn cakes were crispy. It's stuffed with shredded chicken & cheese. It has a creamy/mayo based sauce on it. But again, it was bland. I was hoping for more flavor. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't great. So at the end I ended up packing up the unfinished food... which I gave to my dad since he didn't have lunch.",

Their arepa is probably my favorite item. It's griddled a little crispier and thinner than what you would find at a Columbian or Venezuelan place, but I really like it like that. It's less bready, and they stuff it with plenty of protein (I usually get their shredded chicken).   Also of note, carne asada fries. They are great drinking food. I suggest pouring some of the roasted habanero salsa on top.   As always, parking in NoDa sucks, so uber or lyft there, and plan to have some margaritas and/or beer (they always have a nice selection of beer).",

My fiance and I decided try a few things and share. She ordered the Autentico Steak Taco, and the Americano Shrimp Taco. I had the Autentico Chicken Taco with shredded chicken, and the American fish taco. We shared a beef empanada.   Everything was fantastic. The empanada was the best I've ever had. (hailing from South Florida, this says a lot) The Autenticos tacos were better than the Americanos, although I wouldn't any away from ordering either again.   The salsa bar left a little to be desired, although the 2 we tried were very good, albeit the mild was a little watery for our taste. They have a good selection of local brews as well (cans and bottles). I didn't see any drafts, although I wasn't really looking for them.   Don't forget to get free chips with your Yelp Check in.   We will definitely make this a staple when we venture to this part of town.",

This is one of those fast casual places where you walk in put in your order and then come get your food when it's called. That's alright with me. Though I did spend like 5 minutes trying to find some napkins the first time I was here. I thought it would be where the utensils are but apparently they're at the food pickup station.  I have tried the arepa, steak fries, burrito, and protein bowl here so far along with the street corn of course. The protein bowl is by far the most disappointing of the bunch. I get that it's one of the healthier options but I could identify barely any quinoa in it when I got it. It's more of a rice bowl with avocado and some white sauce. All the other options are pretty nice though, especially the steak fries and burrito. They're fucking gigantic.  The fare is pretty standard though the portions are quite big and the prices cheap. Do not order an appetizer cause it is just as big as an entree.",

Definitely appreciated the Latino tunes :) I recommend Sabor to anyone wanting to grab a quick bite of awesome food!",

We first came for the dollar tacos on weekdays from 3-5 and have continued to come back for the other delicious entrees. Although there is often a long line during the dollar taco times, service moves quickly! The atmosphere is super fun, although a bit noisy from everyone enjoying themselves. If that's a problem for you, there is some sidewalk seating which is a nice way to take in the neighborhood view.   We also love the multitude of vegetarian options!",

Empanadas and burritos are also delicious, and their lighter menu is good as well. They also sell local beer and I've heard their margaritas are amazing as well. On top of that, their price point...!! Good for the soul, stomach, and wallet.",

Make sure you check in to get the free chips which come out warm and get a side of guac, fresh and very tasty. Beware if you have extra guac and take it home it will go brown the next day bc it's so fresh!  Definitely get the tacos authenticos with steak and fish. The steak is well seasoned and cooked so its not too chewy and not too tough. The fish has a nice crispy layer on the outside and great flavor as well.   The salsa bar covers a range of spice tolerences, even satisfying my mom who's spice tolerence is off the charts!",

Let's start with the good, though. The food isn't the worst thing I've ever tasted. The portions are pretty decent sized. And the girl serving me was both cute and super super nice and helpful. A total angel! The place is all about the salsas and it has some pretty decent ones.  Now on to the bad things. FIrstly, this region of America seems clueless on what Mexican food is. These are supposed to be real tacos? They're not. They're only slightly more authentic than the likes of Taco Bell. They have a few authentic elements but they're extremely Americanized. All the little local taco places that are serving up real Mexican stuff go unnoticed, and then this place, aimed at college kids, hipsters, and basically non-Latinos, gets all this credit and rave reviews. It's not the rave reviews that get me, it's the implication that it's \"real Mexican.\" Nah, it's not. It's half and half. Somewhere between. It's on the right track but there are places that are all the way down that track in in the station and serving up the real thing, and they get almost no press or attendance from all these people. It was so packed out of the door and it's so beloved by the Charlotte locals and young people. Some were loudly discussing how this is the exact same stuff they ate in Mexico. It's not! It can't be! But okay.  And Street Grill? Really? In Mexico that would be a joke. It's so not \"Street.\"  Anyway, I don't hate it. I really don't. And I wish them well. It's a little expensive for me and not Mexican enough. Lol.",

Prices need to be re-evaluated here. What really did it for me is when I asked before taking the order if one was WITHOUT chicken given that I had ordered one without it and the guy said yes. I know to always double check and once in the car I did and BOTH had chicken.  Glad I wasn't far and I went back in to change it and was told they were out of cabbage. So  if they would've actually read the ticket and cared to read and would've done it right I would've been able to enjoy my yuca fries. Vegetarians ALWAYS double check your orders here. They obviously don't care about people's eating choices. This is actually the second time this happens to me at one of these restaurants but luckily the first time I dined in  so I  was able to switch it right away but still So disappointed in the lack of care and service.",

Second stop in I had the Quinoa Avocado bowl and added chicken and it was very satisfying without sacrificing too much on taste.  Have stopped in twice now at the Elizabeth location just off 7th and can only complain about the parking spaces so far.  This place is always hopping though so best to come off peak.  Do they use the highest quality ingredients?  not sold on that but you certainly get what you pay for and with my expectations being as high as Yelpers on here make them, I'd have to say they were met in full.

We walked in here Tuesday after work for the $1 specials, we ordered the chicken and veggie tacos ( so glad they had veggie!). Must hit the salsa bar before chowing down. I loved the veggie tacos, filled with zucchini, yellow squash, and onions, very hearty for a veggie taco. The chicken tacos were also good. These were very authentic street tacos, corn tortillas all the way. Definitely coming back for Taco Tuesday.   Also, my coworker got a burrito from here during lunch break, it was huge!

    "text": "I've been to this Sabor location and the food here is great... the parking... not-so-much.  Depending on the time of day, the parking lot can be a little crazy.  Between the other businesses and especially the UPS Store, sometimes the parking lot can be very difficult to navigate.  Add that to the craziness of Taco Tuesday, it results in a total raise in blood pressure just trying to get into the door.  The location is small too:  handful of booths, tables, and some stand up window seating makes for an interesting meal when you have to keep an eye out for the next party to get up and free up some space.  Other than that, the food here is pretty delicious (hence the crowd) and also the line that goes out the door during Taco Tuesdays.    Come in, order at the counter, and wait for your name to be called - depending on what you get, the food takes no time to come out.  It can get really loud inside so just be ready to listen for your name to be called out.  Staff is super friendly and you can't ask for a cooler place to hang out.  Have not been to the other Sabor locations, but maybe they have less of a headache parking situation than this one.  Ideally I think this place would be awesome if you lived in Elizabeth and could walk here.",

They have a wide selection of drinks. I ordered a shrimp burrito and my fella ordered a tilapia one (we are still doing the pescatarian diet or else he would've gotten steak). We also shared some queso. It was yummy! I loved everything about our food. It was fresh, hot, packed with flavor and a ton of food. It was the only meal we ate that day because it was so much food. I can't wait to try more things the next time we go back.  Thumbs up.",

Now it's often hard to find a table because they have outgrown their original space. Sabor specializes in simple and delicious traditional Latin American street food that's affordable and fast (well, it should be!). I've taken away one star because sometimes the service can be horribly slow. If you've been waiting long, speak up! It's not unheard of for them to lose your ticket when they're busy. The palomas, margaritas, and mojitos are great, but getting your first drink is a pain, and getting another requires that you get back in line, order, and wait AGAIN. The $1 tacos every day from 3-5pm are my favorite (tacos authenticas). I always get shredded chicken and have them add pineapple. Yum!! I also highly recommend the nachos, and you must try the arepa, especially if you've never had one. And the guac is a must! ***If you have Celiac Disease or are gluten sensitive, please note that they use shared fryers. I've never gotten sick here, but I also have never eaten anything that's in the fryer for more than a few seconds (like the chips). If you are extremely sensitive, I would recommend avoiding anything that is fried.",

I am definitely glad they took over the old Phat Burrito/Scoops place to bring us some Latin street food.  I will admit, I kind of thought this place was going to be some sort of Chipotle/Moe's/Qdoba - type of place.  I am so glad that it is so much more than just burritos, salads and tacos.  I have really been more about trying the street food part of their menu.  The two best things I've had on the menu have been the pupusa with grilled veggies and the veggie empanada.  The pupusa has a great corn flavor and the grilled veggies make a divine filling.  Add some of curtido from the salsa bar, and it becomes magical.  The gorditas had a great crispy shell, and the chicken on the inside was flavorful and moist.  The tacos autenticos and arepas are all right.  The seasoning on the steak is pretty delicious, but in my mind, I suppose it needs a little more than just the onions and cilantro.  I tried the tacos autenticos with the fish, which was pretty decent as well.  The taco salad is good, but it is a little weird that it has rice in in.  However, the rice and beans are quite tasty.  My only disappointment here is with the guacamole.  It was quite bland the day I had it, which made me a very sad Ana.  Everyone I've met is so nice and this place has a decent amount of seating (possibly equal to or a little more than Three Amigos).  They also serve margaritas and beer, so WHEE!  It won't be long before I'm back at this place again.  I hope it does better than its last two predecessors.",

Pet peeve number one when eating out: greet me like you are excited to have my business! The older cashier guy looked like he'd rather be home eating real food than taking my order. I put my order in..fast forward to eating it. The empanadas were WAY. TO. FRIGGING. BIG. They put a whole pound of meat in it. You'd think why am I complaining? With an Empanada you gotta have balance not put a whole cow in it. Arepas: It was an arepa sandwich! Two arepas again, with the amount of chicken they put on it you couldve made two huge subs! And the burrito...Im sorry, where is the tortilla? Or is this just all chicken?! The taste wasnt bad but you get turned off wondering: How can they afford to give out so much meat...{shutters}. I hear they are known for their tacos...and its also in the Elizabeth area, hipster heaven. So Im assuming thats who they cater to because if they are trying to show off original Latin style plates, they failed. Besides, tacos and arepas are from two completely different cultures...just saying. Im pretty heart broken about this one. Sorry, wont go again.",

This time, the focus is on traditional Mexican street eats and the fare is on the rise to becoming a more-than-regular spot for us.   Came in on a Saturday before noon. The space is still being outfitted and decorated, so it has a bit of a feel leftover from the previous biz. I couldn't care less. The magic happens behind the counter and in the kitchen.   The high notes:  Pupusas -- If you've never tried a pupusa, you're missing out. Thick, fried dough, veggies, cheese, and pressed flat. Incredible. It may look small, but don't be fooled. It's filling.   Arepas. Filled with shredded chicken and some of the tastiest veggies I've had in a long time. The chicken had a flavor that was mild, yet pungent. The juices that came from the chicken, which I'm assuming was made in a pressure cooker, permeated the bread and almost made into two separate items. It didn't last long on my plate.   Empanada. The crispy dough filled with even more cheese and veggies was equally amazing. Textbook execution.   Tacos Autenticas. Perfect. Chicken, white onion, cliantro. That's all, that's all you need. Perfection.   Guac. What else do you need to know? It's GUAC. I'd eat it every day of my life. The chips are seasoned, too, which is a nice touch.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Sabor. I'm excited to see how it builds out and becomes more of an Elizabeth staple. I'll be back soon. Next time: Burrito.",

    "text": "Arguably the best food per $ in Charlotte.  Great beer selection, fast service, and just all around good food.  Located in the old Phat Burrito spot in the strip mall at the corner of Hawthorne and 7th, this place is going to fill a niche Charlotte has needed.  Legit, cheap, Latin/Mexican food without having to go to the ghetto looking for a food truck.  Brought to you by the people that being you 3 Amigo's Mexican food and Salud beer shop.  This place has instantly become a major staple in my weekly rotation of good/cheap eats.  When you walk in there are 2 HUGE LCD screens with menus that are easily readable.  Although, you may think your eyes are deceiving you when you can order an arepa, a empenada, and a pupusa for under $10.  I thought I was that hungry and wanted to try them all.  The beers aren't extremely cheap but, the quality is there.  Sammy Smith's organic apricot ale is AMAZING, even if you don't like \"fruity\" beers.  You can go as cheap as 4.95 for a house margarita up to 9.95 for Patron and Grand Marnier.  I'd recommend spending at least the $6.95 and getting 1800 and Cointreau.  The food came out quick and boy it was good.  I went over to the salsa bar to see what accoutrements were needed.  The pickled veggies worked great with the fattiness of the pupusa, a little pico de gallo mixed with the hot sauce to go in my arepa, and then a little more pico for our chips and guacamole.  There were some other choices as well.  The salsa verde serving its purpose and then a ketchup based pink sauce that just didn't do it for me.  With all the fried dough, meats, and cheeses I barely ate half of my meal.  Made for a great re-heated after the bar snack though.  The arepa was especially large and filled to the rim.  Bottom line, good eats and for a very reasonable price.  I'll be back again and again.",

I'm a big fan of Three Amigos (same group that owns this place), so I know it would probably be pretty good.  I've always wanted to venture a little farther down Central avenue to the land of the True Latin food, but I just hadn't mustered up the courage to do so (looks a little sketchy to say the least).  I've never had a papusa or an arepa before, but they're terrific.  I love the thick corn tortillas they use.  I'm an American, so naturally I've eaten flour tortillas my whole life.  I've come to prefer corn in recent years.  Out of everything I've tried, I'd have to go with the papusas and empanadas as my favorite.  Do NOT forget the salsas.  They bring some serious heat that gives a badass crunchy, chewy, cheesy, SPICY punch.",

I've never had anything like it before - there was almost a sweetness to it. Definitely a must try! I also had an empanada because I love them at Three Amigos, and this one was just as yummy (dare I say even tastier?). It was full of cheesy chicken and cooked to perfection - aways a favorite. The boyfriend ordered two of the tacos authenticos with steak and he liked em! Monday-Friday they have the tacos for 99 cents from 3p-5p which is a pretty awesome deal.  We also ordered the chips and guacamole which were really good, but we had way too much food and will probably do without those next time.  Beer selection is good but definitely over priced. Example, the Recreationale was $3 something and up the street at the corner store, its $1 something.  We went for coronas.    I'm a fan and will be back to Sabor!",

Oh my goodness  it's amazing fresh street food in hip, restaurant format! It's usually hard to find a seat - especially on a Friday night. I would suggest anything on the menu and make sure you get ROSADA sauce!! It's over on the side with all the other salsa's. I love how they serve the tacos open-faced topped with cilantro and a lime wedge on the side (how do they know me so well?!) My advice? Go there! Multiple times.  They have good margaritas too. I was surprised by that. Thumbs up Sabor.",

My favorites are the authenticos tacos with shredded chicken. They serve some fantastic pico de gallo, so grab a side of that and put it on everything.   Sabor is going to be one of my regular spots, especially once the streetcar opens in mid July. The prices are very reasonable; couple tacos and sides will run less than $10.",

My husband and I came here for dinner with a friend one night & we've been to Sabor numerous times so we knew what to expect. Our friend got his food before us, which we understood & didn't think much of, but we started to realize that people who ordered their food AFTER us were being called up to pick up their food. We waited 15 minutes before my husband went up to ask about our food. The girl manning the orders didn't ask for his name and just brushed him off by saying \"it's not ready yet\". We gave them the benefit of the doubt and let them do their thing. 25 minutes later and we still didn't have our food. My husband went up yet again and they asked for his name; they pretended like they were looking for his name and said \"your food isn't ready yet but it'll be ready soon\" 35 minutes later, we were upset & our friend was done with his food. My husband goes up again AND THEY REALIZED THEY LOST HIS TICKET and our food was yet to be made. One, they lied to us. Two, they should have handled this entire situation differently. All we got was an apology and nothing more.",

Though it sometimes is a hassle to find a parking spot (it's Charlotte, after all!) circling around the parking lot a few times is always worth it, even if it takes an extra ten minutes or so. Ordering is easy...if you do indeed go on a Tuesday, there are plenty of specials plainly listed on a chalkboard by the registers and if you go on other days, the daily specials are always there and easy to spot. The large menu hangs overhead and is filled with a great variety of Latin street food with great vegetarian options! The tacos are delicious and packed with whatever savory protein or vegetables you prefer and service is extremely fast, even when they are busy. The wait gives you just enough time to fill your drink and get a couple of cups of your favorite salsa from their salsa bar near the back of the restaurant. Seating may be a challenge as the restaurant is usually packed with hungry folks wanting the best tacos in town, but service is usually quick enough that someone is just about ready to leave when you are ready to sit down. For some great offbeat choices try both varieties of nachos. One utilizes Yucca fries instead of tortilla chips for a great change in taste. If you haven't been, you need to turn your Taco Tuesdays into something special and make your everyday lunch and dinners into a savory treat by going to Sabor!",

Nothing epic at all - I was concerned that maybe it was going to be too much for lunch but I cold have eaten 3 of them. There was enough chicken on it for maybe 1 taco.  Although the other visits have been good - it's all relative. For a quick casual place with a decent selection of craft beers I like it. I am concerned though that with more visits will be more opportunities for lack of quality (think Vinnie's).",

Since moving to Charlotte I was searching for just that and I am in luck cause I found it in Sabor.   First of the prices are AWESOME! The only problem is that I order way too much food, because it is so cheap and delicious (not a bad problem in my mind)! Next time I will try to make it to happy hour for the dollar tacos, but even without I am not breaking the bank. I tried the tacos authenticas and tacos americanos and the chicken arepa. I prefer the tacos authenticas, because it is fresh and is not overpacked with cheese, but no surprise there. Don't get me wrong the tacos americanos by no means bad, but when looking for traditional street food it is authenticas all the way. Now on to the arepa, excellent, delicious and everything I was hoping for. We also got a large guacamole with chips, which was huge and enough for multiple days, but it was so delicious I didn't mind one bit. A friend had an empanada and it was also excellent. The salsa bar didn't have a lot of options but their pico and avocado salsas were perfect additions! Overall I can't rave enough about Sabor.   The decor in Sabor is simple and reminds me of a warehouse, but it was plenty fine to eat in, plus I wasn't focused on the restaurant I was focused on my food!  I can't wait until I go back to Sabor for some more delicious food!",

    "text": "Stopped in here a couple of weeks ago and was very happy with the outcome. I capitalized greatly on all the deals found here on Yelp including the $7 for $10 coupon and FREE chips which made the trip that much more worth it. Not to mention, a big ol' plate of chips complimented the fresh salsa bar well. They also put some sort of spice on the chips that kicks them up a notch.  In general pricing was great. You get a lot of bang (read: food) for the buck and freshness was certainly apparent. I got the El Dominicano which was a new take on what I consider a typical burrito. I'd definitely get it again. I also got an empanada which was \"okay\". It certainly wasn't the highlight of the experience and I think I would prefer replacing it with an arepa or a taco in the future. Oh, I believe it's Tuesday that they offer $1 tacos too (limited times during the day though)!  If I were to offer one main criticism here it would be the cleanliness. Don't get me wrong, by no means did I feel this place was unsanitary from a food perspective but rather tables were left messy from previous customers as well as the floors etc. This could have been an \"off day\" and is a situation easily remedied but like I said, my one main criticism.  If you're looking for mostly authentic Latin American street food this is certainly worth checking out.",

    "text": "I never realized this place was here until recently, and I consider myself pretty much \"in the know\" about the Charlotte restaurant scene. Well, I apparently made one really big oversight. Sabor blew my mind. I've never had tacos this good. I first went to get a burrito on a Tuesday, and realized that they had $1 tacos on Tuesdays, but my mind was set on a burrito. So I just got one beef taco on the side. Heck, it was just a buck. The chicken burrito was delicious, but the taco was the real standout. I wished I could've reverted my order and gone all tacos.   So it wasn't long before I was back. Taco Tuesdays only applies to the Autenticos tacos, which include cilantro, lemon, and a lime wedge on a corn tortilla. But this time I wanted to try the Americanos taco, complete with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. I had three tacos - beef, tilapia, and shredded chicken. All amazingly delicious and fresh on a flour tortilla.  My wife and I returned only a few days later and both agreed - best tacos ever.  Then the next week I decided I had to spread the love in my office and brought back 20 tacos back to work on Taco Tuesday. They were a hit with everyone. People asking me where in the heck I got them from. Next time I go, they wanted me to bring some for them again.  Next time, I bought 20 tacos again on Taco Tuesday to take home. My family ate nothing but tacos for 2 days.  This is really one of my favorite local joints in Charlotte. It takes a lot to get me back to a restaurant 5 times in a month, but it's that good. My recommendation is the ground beef (and no, I'm not talking Taco Bell type ground beef) or the pulled chicken. The tilapia was good, but more expensive and it didn't top the beef or chicken.  I can't wait to return again. These guys have done Latin street food right!",

Brought out on a pizza pan and piled high with ingredients. We couldn't eat 1/4 of them and happily brought them home for a snack later. Next time I will try the Dominican Nachos... made with Yuca fries instead of chips.  The empanadas are good, but I wish the Chorizo was spicier! The fish taco looks yummy although I didn't get to try it. Great guacamole and very reasonable prices! Get the large with unlimited chips  for only $2.95.  The salsa bar is very clean and had several choices from mild to spicy. The Chipolote? salsa (can't remember for sure) was especially good, spicy but not so hot you couldn't enjoy it.   The burritos are also HUGE. Enough for 2 or 3 meals for most people. My 11 yo ordered the steak build your own burrito and was very happy with it. Another one ordered the Sabor Especial and said it was delicious.   Sabor offers beer, wine and some specialty drinks. The Dark & Stormy was excellent. As good as the ones I had on my honeymoon in Bermuda.",

After hearing about the mythical one dollar taco days, I made my way over to Sabor. I must have been super lucky in terms of timing because five minutes after I walked in and order the place went from being super empty to having a line out of the door (around 6:45 PM). Ordered one veggie taco, two chicken, and one ground beef.   Not a huge fan of ground beef, but you can only choose from a select menu for the $1 special. The cook also mixed the chicken and beef which wasn't appetizing and the second chicken taco barely had any meat in it. I get the place was slammed, so the lack of quality wasn't the biggest deal especially at the price point.",

They touch on quite a few different Latin cuisines so you can get anything from arepas, to empanadas to Mexican corn on the cob (which I haven't tried yet, but plan to). Also, for the tacos you can choose American style or Authentic which is a good option. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we came on a Saturday night like 8 pm and it was a bit chaotic and our tacos were cold when we got them. We didn't have a problem waiting, having come from a restaurant service background but at least make sure the food is hot afterwards. Will continue to come back!",

    "text": "A couple of colleagues and I decided to meet up for a casual dinner at Sabor Latin Street Grill.  Back then, there was a ton of trolley construction, so parking and stuff could be a little difficult.  Not sure if that is still the case.  Anyway, the place was PACKED.  Know why?  Because it was Taco Tuesday!  I had no idea about the $1 taco specials here until I showed up at a packed house on Taco Tuesday.  Seems like a pretty darn good deal for dinner if you ask me.  I didn't choose to get any of the $1 tacos since I wanted some other \"speciality\" ones.  There is no waitstaff at this restaurant - you pick up your food and find a place to sit.  Theres a decent number of tables and booths available, but you may have to wait/stalk a table when its busy.  We got a side of guacamole which was very fairly priced and came with unlimited chips.  Fresh, well made guacamole that probably could have used a teeeeeny more salt, but whatever.    I got all my tacos \"Autenticos\" - cilantro (YUM), diced onion, and a lime wedge - just the way i like it.  I got the grilled steak and al pastor tacos, which were not part of the deal.  They were well seasoned and the meat was tender, but I wouldn't call this super *authentic* tacos.  Probably the best you can find in Charlotte, but I've had better tacos elsewhere.  The good thing about Sabor is that they have a crazy amount of different salsas and hot sauces you can put on your taco that definitely spruce it up.  I got an elote (grilled corn) as well and I wasn't a huge fan.  I'm spoiled by the delcious elote back in NYC.  I also recommend getting a Jarrito.  I always get a tamarind Jarrito at every taco place I go to for some reason.  Yum sugar.",

It wasnt as good so it lowered my expectation. The cashier seemed like she was impatient with us trying to figure out what to order as well and had a stank face the whole time. She also sounded like she was having an attitude. Not trying to shit on Saber but it was my first time here. The vibe wasnt has great.",

Outside of paying more for protein we don't get, it's a 4/5 star all day.",

The food was very good and the lady at the front desk was very polite and helped me out with the menu. It's a nice little place to eat and chill. Nice music and ambiance nice place. She also informed me they have $1 Taco Tuesday's!!!!  I will definitely be back for that:) Also no offense to Hot Taco I've been there as well but Sabor's tacos taste better:)",

I have tried the nachos, street tacos/authenticos, and especial burrito. The quest is amazing, I will admit that 100-% and would go there for that alone. But the nachos were fine but expensive, the burrito was not memorable. The street tacos/authenticos with steak were very dry and the pork was not my favorite taste. I do enjoy the salsa bar.",

I visited this restaurant at 9:45 on a Tuesday night (15 mins before closing).....the place was packed and had people coming in the door till 10pm.    This is almost like Food Truck food.....but SOOOO MUCH BETTER.     I had the Burrito Espaciale....it was a generous portion loaded with flavor.  Delicious!   I also had chips and Salsa.  They had like 6 or 8 different types of salsa ranging from Mild to Hot....some with Jalapeno (which was my fave..... one with pineapple which was awesome too.  This place had about 6-7 booths, 4 or 5 tables for 4, a couple of 2 tops, and a food bar with stools at the window.    Price was around $10 or so with a drink.  I will definitely go back.",

Take a seat and shortly thereafter, when your food is ready, someone from behind the service counter will yell out your name. Go get your food and hit the salsa bar. Personally, I like the Pineapple Habanero. It's the perfect balance of sweet and hot. We ordered a large queso dip and it comes with free chips. For my entree, I ordered 2 Tacos Locos Chicken. These tacos come on corn tortillas with shredded cabbage, crumbled chorizo, diced tomatoes and Cotija cheese. I don't know what else to say about these tasty devils other than muy delicioso! I also ordered the Elote Loco. This grilled corn on the cob is smothered in mayonnaise then sprinkled with spices and cotija cheese. I like the corn but I could take it a little spicier.  For dessert, we ordered plantanos maduros. These fried plantains were very tasty. They were sprinkled with the cotija cheese and cilantro, served with crema. We went on Saturday so Craft Beers are half off. They sell NoDa and Birdsong. I got a Birdsong Jalapeno Pale Ale. It was in a can which is okay but I prefer draft. I will return! Ingredients are definitely fresh!",

I repeat, starving. The place was full but not too full and the line moved quickly. I loved the cooler of local beer next to line. They have half price craft beer on Saturdays, um what? We were instantly sold.   The salsa bar is a nice touch, but just ok.   We ordered the corn, chips and guac, a shrimp burrito, and the avocado/quinoa bowl. YUM YUM YUM!  I am obsessed with guacamole, and there's was great. And affordable! Everywhere is $10 now a days, but you can get a large serving here for $4!!! The avocado/quinoa bowl was delicious and filling. Just enough food. The shrimp burrito was huge! And full of shrimp! I had several shrimp per bite, so they did not skimp us on this! The corn was absolutely to die for. We got our food very fast, even on a Saturday night.   I can't wait to come back! We want to try the Arepa and the steak fries. I feel like lately we have been spending so much money on Mexican food just to be disappointed, and we wonder how this happens. We had chips and guac, free salsa, a burrito, corn, and the avocado/quinoa bowl with 2 craft beers for $35!  They even have cheap margaritas/mixed drinks. We will try these next time as well.",

In fact, it brings in dishes of all Latin cultures.  Whether you're in the mood for nachos (my personal favorite) or an arepa, they have traditional dishes from Venezuela, Argentina, the DR, and more.    It's fast (ish) food where you order at the counter and then pick up up when they cal your name.  I frequent the Plaza Midwood and NODA location.  Both are pretty busy and forget trying to get a seat on taco Tuesday!  But, for $1 authenticos, I'd eat a taco while standing any day.  Recommended items: Nachos. The toppings are evenly distributed which is really what we are all looking for in a good dish of nachos and there is enough to feed two people for under $10.  Also their queso is not cheap but worth the purchase.  I get it every single time.   Don't pass up the salsa bar!  They have a number of house made salsas.  Make sure to try the pineapple habanero!",

From Tacos to Burritos Sabor has great ones! Or if you are in the mood for something a little more authentic and adventures they have that as well. On top of all of this they also have the best salsa bar I have had in Charlotte!",

The chorizo was very underwhelming. Not sure if it's house made, but it's lacking in color and seasonings. The tacos I got weren't hot but lukewarm. Also, to ask for a tip when no I one serves us our food if we stay doesn't make any type of sense. But let me get to the worst part. Those margaritas. TERRIBLE. Maybe they forgot the tequila but it was overly sweet. And we all know tequila has distinct aroma so I know it wasn't added. I will say though, the empanadas were very well made. Other than that I just have to use better judgement when looking for places to eat. The recommendations are so misleading smh.",

    "text": "I need to preface this review by saying I love Mexican food. Anytime I have a choice of where I want to go out to eat, I almost always choose Mexican. I am a diehard Chipotle fan, and I refuse to go to Qdoba or Moe's because I don't think their ingredients are fresh enough.   My brother and I went to the soft opening on Wednesday, July 3rd. We are both fans of the owner's other restaurant (Three Amigos) on Facebook, and we saw a link that referred us to Sabor Latin Street Grill's page for a free meal coupon at the soft opening. We were both excited about attending because we both live very close to this location and wanted to try out this new restaurant.  I ordered the Sabor Especial burrito (Burrito with your choice of meat and filled with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, lettuce and cheese sauce) with chicken and my brother ordered it with steak. We also shared an order of chips with sides of guacamole and queso. Both of us loved our burritos. The guacamole was fantastic and it was obvious it had been made fresh that day. The queso was good also. They also have a salsa bar, which I didn't try but it was a nice touch to the place.  The prices were very reasonable and the owner was very personable and friendly. I will definitely be returning often. It looks like I'll stop being a regular at the Chipotle in the Metropolitan area (which is going to shock all of my friends) and I'll be coming here instead.  I can't wait to try the other items on the menu. I saw someone's order of the gorditas and they looked wonderful, so I might end up making a trip soon to try those.   Try Sabor Latin Street Grill soon - you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Maybe we went on an off day/time, but Sabor wasn't that great. We went in on a Wednesday around 7:00pm. It was pretty quiet inside with only one other table occupied.   We walked in and saw the order counter in front of us, two large LCD's displaying the menu above, and coolers full of beer on the left. They had a good selection of craft and Mexican beers. The decor was plain and simple. Nothing exciting. We ordered, paid, and sat down. Not long after, they called my name and we picked the food up at the counter.   The food:  Arepa - The star of the plate! Tender, well seasoned chicken stuffed inside a fresh corn flatbread and topped with cheese. I would go back just for this! It is a sizable portion, too.  Pupusa - Spinach and cheese filled. I was largely unimpressed with this. It was really dry and kind of hard, like it had been reheated.  Empanda - Chicken and cheese filled. Unfortunately, the chicken was dry and the filling was under-seasoned.  It outside was nicely cooked.   Taco Authentico - Steak. Not too bad but not that exciting.  Chips - Warm. Thick. Seasoned (but not evenly). I was ok with them but they weren't my favorite.   Salsa bar - I was largely unimpressed with the salsa bar. The ice was all melted and most of the containers were empty. It definitely did not look like it did in Ben G.'s photo. Three of the salsas were in squeeze bottles. The hot salsa was hot enough to burn your face off. I'm not a hot/spicy food whimp by any means, but this was straight up burn with no flavor. Extremely underseasoned. The taste reminded me of habaneros that had been blended and bottled. Not my favorite. The salsa verde was supposedly hot but it wasn't that spicy and also flavorless. The best out of the batch was the pink sauce. It wasn't so much a salsa as a crema. I'm not really sure how the pickled onions and cabbage constituted a salsa.   I like the concept of Sabor but their food just didn't impress me. I'd be willing to give them another shot. Maybe I'll try the burrito next time.",

We stopped in on Saturday, and were probably the first customers in the door at just before noon. We stepped up to the counter, in awe of the menu options described on the screens above the counter. We ordered arepas, pupusas and empanadas, along with tacos. Oh, and of course our favorite appetizer: chips and guac.  After ordering, we stepped up to the soda fountain and poured our own soft drinks. In a few minutes, our food was ready.   To be honest, I know very little about Latin street food, but I do know what tastes good, and everything we tried was incredibly delicious. I'd have to say that the arepas and pupusas were my favorites out of the lot.  Make sure you order multiples of menu items-arepas, pupusas and empanadas come in portions of one. I should have ordered two each of the arepas and pupusas. So stinking delicious.  Vegetarians won't go hungry here, as there are numerous options available. I am really a fan of this place, and can see it filling quickly with those seeking inexpensive and piquant food. It's none too fancy, which is the way I like it.  I'm looking forward to going back...hopefully tomorrow!",

Reasonable prices, and a sweet bar of freshly made salsas. If you're not a spicy kind of person, I would avoid the salsa roja in the squeeze bottle. To me, it is amazing. To some others you might sweat profusely or lose a few nose hairs.  I got three tacos: chicken, steak and fish, authentico of course, with onion, cilantro and a wedge of lime. The meats/fish were seasoned perfectly. I can appreciate the fact that they grill the tilapia instead of frying it. Delicious!! My friend ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla, which was huge! Delicious flavor, and lots of cheese.   Having been on the job, I couldn't indulge in one of their margaritas, but they sure do look good. They also serve an array of bottled and canned beers. I will most certainly be taking advantage of these things next time.   Oh yeah, M-F they have 99 tacos from 3-5. That's enough for me to commit!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I expected a lot less, even after reading other Yelp reviews. Gladly I was pleasantly surprised. My wife and daughter and I lunch out on Saturdays and Sundays, and we always try to visit someplace we haven't been before. Being the only Elite Yelper in the house (a shot at my wife who is not Elite), it is my duty to pick the restaurant. And drive to the restaurant. And pay at the restaurant. Hey, wait a minute!  Sabor isn't much to look at from the outside, or from the inside for that matter. When walking in, there is a counter in front of the door where you place your order. The menu over the counter is detailed enough for a gringo like me to make an educated decision when ordering. I like that. Checking in on Yelp unlocked a  free order of chips. WIN! I ordered a steak salad for lunch. The menu states that sour cream and cheese is optional. Yes please. The menu also mentions that guacamole is .25 extra. OK, I'll spring for an extra quarter. I also ordered their \"crazy corn\" for an extra $2.49. After paying you grab your drink, visit the salsa bar, and find a seat. When they call your name, you go back up to pick up your food. The only thing I didn't like (made it 4 stars instead of 5) is that there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to how your food is prepared. They call your name as each dish is ready. Not a big deal, but a little awkward if you happen to be the first one to receive your meal.   My salad was a little but on the small side, but not too bad. The steak was grilled to perfection, the other ingredients were delish too. I especially liked the taco shell, I'm pretty sure it was freshly made. My wife enjoyed her tacos, my daughter loved her steak quesadilla (it looked really yummy!). But what stole the show for me was the crazy corn. Check this out. A full sized ear of corn. Lathered in mayo (yes, mayo). Sprinkle some cojita cheese and chili powder over the corn. What do you have? Crazy corn. And it was crazy good. The thought of the mayo turned off my girls, but I'm always up for something crazy. It was crazy good!  Lunch for the 3 of us was around $30, and we left very full. I noticed they have Dos Equis Amber available for purchase, maybe when I come back for dinner.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte, so I decided to finally write a review. This is a counter-service, very casual mexican/ latin food joint. They have most of the usual suspects like tacos, quesadillas, and burritos, but then they have other \"latin street food\" that is where they really shine. My favorites are the empanadas and the arepas. The arepa is a white corn cake, crispy on the outside, filled with well seasoned and juicy shredded chicken, shredded cheese, and this delicious pink sauce (that resembles ketchup and mayo mixed together in appearance, but tastes much better than that). I also love the steak tacos, the steak is so flavorful! This place does get really crowded at lunch, but they get the food out pretty fast. Also, if you don't have to go back to work, they have a really good selection of craft beer in cans and bottles. (and all the favorite Mexican beers, too) In short, come to Sabor, I'm sure you'll find something you like!",

The place is wide open inside with a fair amount of seating and some spots outside on the sidewalk.  Two meals and two drinks was about $20.  Not bad and comparable prices to other places around town that serve the same kind of food.  We will definitely be going back soon!",

They do have a parking lot but it's small and parking can sometimes be a bit of a challenge.  Also the staff has always been warm and friendly.

A large beer selection is available with half price craft beers on Saturdays. A very nice surprise for me.    As far as the food. They offer a variety of dishes from tacos to empanadas, arepas and burritos. I went outside the box and ordered the Dominican Nachos, which are. Yucca fries covered with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, cabbage and their Sabor pink sauce. It was delicious. I will definitely go back for this.    My wife had the steak tacos. I stole one and thought the steak was a little tough and they skimped on the onions and cilantro. I'll pass on this one. We also ordered a margarita which did not lack tequila. Very nice.    The service was quick and the location is convenient off of the highway. I recommend if in the area",

I ordered the chicken empanada which was delicious. And it had real oozing delicious cojita cheese, not that nacho cheese.like some places like to put in their empanadas. I had a small side of rice which was just enough, chips, the corn and or course queso. The quest was delicious. Don't forget to fire up your Yelp app and check in so you can get some free chips. They have great customer service, I asked the manager if they were going to put plantains on the menu and he informed me that they had them but they were no longer on the menu and he bright me some complimentary fresh rips plantains!!!!!! Which were delicious by the way. I'll definitely be back and I'm glad that they have a few other locations around town.",

Get a mountain of nachos and have like, four friends to share them with. Don't get the fish tacos but everything else is wonderful. House margarita is also very yummy.

You can't park anywhere. So I parked one block away from the place. Right now also they are repairing the streets. So forget about parking near the store.  Went around 11:30 on a Thursday. I saw the daily specials right in the front door and ordered the empanada beef and arepa, a drink and chips.  This place is overrated! First of all what I didn't like at all, was that the cashier was mocking me all the time. After I placed my order, he turned the screen of the computer and laughing with their coworkers yelled how much is gonna be today your tip?  Couldn't believe it. Speechless. I mean, really?  Went to grab my drink, I split a bit because (I'm short) and the drink machine is really high and of course, there was an issue, I realized that every single person grabbing a drink slipped a bit. When I stand up because they were calling me, I said to the employee that the floor was really a mess. She laughed and said it was nothing.  Went back to my little table. The Empanada was very oily and had a lot of cumin and cheese? With beef?? Okay. Nothing Latin at all.   They rave about their sauces...? It's just mayo and ketchup mixed.   The arepa... Two huge subs and a bit of chicken with cheese, that I actually didn't like it. Latin food is about flavors. I didn't find any flavor here.  I can't believe the reviews. These people must be used to eat frozen tacos and food from Walmart.    Chips are out of a bag.  And finally... Went to the restroom and there was a big cockroach saying bye to me. Very dirty.  Never ever again be back,",

I've been to this location two times since moving to Charlotte about three weeks ago. During my first visit, I ordered the Sabor Especial Burrito with grilled chicken, rice, black beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole, lettuce, & queso. The burrito was delicious! The pairing of the queso & guacamole were excellent. It is massive by the way, so you will most definitely leave feeling stuffed & happy!   I decided to check out Sabor again this past Tuesday for their $1 taco special. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that tacos are normally priced at $2.95 each and were a freaking dollar on Tuesday! My husband & I split 6 Autenticos Tacos (2 beef, 4 shredded chicken) made from corn tortillas & topped with cilantro, onions, & a lime wedge. The beef tacos were FANTASTIC! The meat was fresh & so very flavorful. I would highly recommend these if you are wondering what to order off the menu. You will not be disappointed.   They also offer a salsa bar with about 6 different salsas from all along the spicy spectrum. My fav is Verde because it isn't too spicy, but has a small kick. Make sure you check in on Yelp because they are offering free chips. If you are looking for authentic Latin food, this is your spot! I will definitely be returning in the future.",

Whether you're hungry enough for one of their big burritos or want a lighter meal of an arepa or empanada, you'll find something to fit your appetite! The generously topped nachos could be a meal in themselves and they're certainly big enough to fill 2 as a hearty snack, while the perfectly proportioned tacos are available both traditional and American style.  Vegetarian choices are available (the aforementioned empanada is a delightful pocket of vegetable and cheese satisfaction) as well as meat options, plus there's a salsa bar that goes from mild to a spiciness that even makes my Cuban friend reach for water - or one of the tasty house margaritas. Sabor is a must-visit whenever we're in Charlotte for simple but satisfying food.",

    "text": "I visited Charlotte this past weekend and when we arrived on Friday night, my friend took my sister and I straight to Sabor to grab some dinner. After a seven-hour drive, we were dying for some grub. It was a packed house so it was clear that this joint is a local favorite. There were tons of families dining in and a long ling of folks picking up.   After taking a look at the menu I went with a quinoa avocado bowl. It came with quinoa and brown rice with avocado, grilled veggies, and a cilantro lime yogurt sauce. I also added shrimp. It took quite a while for our food to be prepared so I walked around and enjoy the art on the walls. They also had a salsa bar with tons of different salsas and sauces to add to your meal. Pro tip - they have a check-in offer for a free bag of tortilla chips. Score!  Once our food was ready we jumped back in the car to enjoy at our friends place before the weekend shenanigans began. I really enjoyed the sauces but overall my bowl felt mushy and bland. Now, I am very much a texture person and I think this is what got me. Yes, it was rice and avocado and grilled veggies... all items that can come off mushy so maybe it was my bad. I should have remembered how much I need texture to enjoy food. I tried using the chips I got to add some crunch but they could have used more salt.   Overall, this place was a solid three stars in my book. Nothing too terrible but nothing too exciting. If I lived in the area I would definitely try this spot again but likely try something different on the menu.",

    "text": "Solid 3 stars from this California transplant on her desperate search for authentic Mexican food in North Carolina.   Pros: The menu was descriptive (included all of the ingredients for each item so we didn't have to ask) and differentiated between authentic dishes and Americanized dishes. Nice selection at the salsa bar and several hot options.   Cons: The woman who took our order was sick. She sneezed and coughed at least three times while taking our order. Gross. One of the salsas had beer in it, but was not marked to indicate it had alcohol in it. Not cool for kids or recovering alcoholics. The steak was fatty, dry and not flavorful. My husband said his pastor was very bland as well.   Just Meh: The shredded chicken was sort of flavorful and somewhat moist. The atmosphere was kinda blah.   We probably won't go back. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't what we were looking for.",

The prices changed in the register system, but not the signage. The quesadilla was $1.75 more than the prices posted. The manager said it had been like that for a month, yet not even a paper sign notified you of the change,. It's a digital sign; not hard to adjust. We went back and forth a bit and her solution was to offer chips. I couldn't eat all the food I had ordered, but I didn't want to argue.   Also, it seems the beers have gone up in price too. A Noda beer was $6.50 and the other was $7.50. I used to enjoy this place for not being expensive, but perhaps with its popularity, it's changing.",

I had the Sabor Especial Burrito with pork and it was strong.  Good flavor and amount of ingredients.  My wife had the Autenticos Tacos (Steak and Shrimp).  She liked both but said the Shrimp was the best.  Also had the Empanadas and Chips.  Really enjoyed the Chips and the Empanadas were ok.  I am not a fan of cheese in my empanadas so that may be the reason.  Service was quick and efficient.  Everything is pretty much self service.  You get drinks, salsa and pick your food at the counter.  Vibe was cool and relaxed.  I will repeat often",

Each time there is a different group working....never a good sign when employee turnover is high. The wait for food is WAY too long. Usually at least 30 minutes at a \"fast food\" type establishment.  Don't even think about going on Taco Tuesday. You might not find a table.  The food is usually good IF you get it. After a 35 minute wait on my  last visit I discovered they had lost my order.  Asked for a refund and they had no idea how to do that. They conduct all of their business on iPads and the staff at the counter seem to have minimal training on it. Don't expect a clean table. They don't staff at an adequate level to keep tables clean between customers.",

I went with the chorizo empanada,  fish taco, and the Yuka fries. I was so happy with my choices. The Yuka fries came with this creamy, addictive dip and had that inner sweetness from the starch. The empanada also had a sweetness in its fried crust. The chorizo wasn't overly spicy. It was delicious and went really well in the empanada. I also loved the fish taco and probably could have ate another. You can't come to Sabor and not get a taco or street food. I will definitely return. Great food, prepared quickly!",

Like tonight for instance, I knew I'd be hungry in 20 mins so I ordered, hit HT for a powerball ticket and some half and half and apples and boom....text received that my order was ready. Don't forget, free chips with Yelp check in. You can bypass the main line if you've already paid online too. The staff is always attentive even if it's chaos in there. It gets super busy every night, really. They have specials daily and don't forget the free salsa bar towards the back.",

    "text": "\"YIKES! She is scarier than that leftover burrito i left under your bed for 5 years\" -- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)  Holy Latin feast! So Mike and I might have gone a bit over board when ordering our dinner on our first visit here, but there were SO many options and we like to eat... so we just ordered everything we wanted. Is that so wrong??  On a business trip (yes again) to Charlotte, I often stalk former Charlotte CM Ben's reviews and top picks to find out where to eat. This was no different (plus he told me about it). Mike, my coworker and friend, and I tend to eat alike, so when I suggested it - he was game. We drove to the other side of town from the office and walked in salivating from the smells emanating from the kitchen.   We pondered over the menu and decided just to go for it - we ordered chips with a large guacamole and large Queso - I mean, why not?, a Papusa, Empanadas and a Burrito especial. I feel like there was something else, but I failed to take a picture of it (and it was Mike's entree, so I didn't eat it).  WOW!  The wait for everything but the chips was awhile, but there were a few people behind the counter - but that just proves everything is made fresh to order.  YUM.  So the guac was so thick and creamy and delicious - I wanted to take it home with me and live with it. Add in the queso, also good, but not nearly as awesome as the guac in comparison, I could have made a meal of the chips. Then they called us for all the food. DAY-UM. The Pupusa a thick, handmade corn tortilla filled with a blend of cheese and cooked pork ground fine - holy damn it was delicious. It was like a stuffed pancake of meaty and cheesy goodness, but Latin-style.  The empanadas were the crispiest and crunchiest I think I have ever had. We got a beef one and a chicken one and split them in half to share - I can't tell you which was better as they were both delicious. Perfectly flavored meats - inside that awesome pastry shell.  By a nose, the beef wins as it had a bit more punch.  As for the burrito - so full it was falling apart by the end and i ate the insides with a fork. Full of meat, rice, beans, veggies - just amazing.  I was pretty damn full by the end, but a good full. Satisfied and bummed I have to drive to Charlotte to eat this amazing food again.",

The chicken arepa is a prefect balance between savory and richness. The empanadas are not made to the ones I am use to but they perfectly crafted.

I went up and asked for more, to which I was given half of a 2 oz cup and a whole lot of hesitation and attitude. When I asked for more they said they had to charge me for more. What? I pay $3 for a taco and they can't give me more cilantro -- which costs $1 per bunch at the grocery store? (And you know they aren't paying that much for it) Is this really asking too much? Last time I came they messed up the order and blamed me for it and didn't even attempt to check or correct it. I have been coming to Sabor almost weekly since I moved to Charlotte but I'm done. Just done. Picture of the food is with the extra cilantro.",

Was expecting a more upscale restaurant so was a little worried when we walked in and saw you order your food at the counter type of place.   Yet staff was extremely helpful and the food was deliciously!   The five dollar margarita was good but very weak, but what do you expect forfive dollars;)   Wish I could of fit an order of nachos in my belly as they looked really good!",

    "text": "This place is a great, quick spot to really order exactly what you're feeling. It allows you to order things from bowls to tacos to burritos, even though they are reusing a lot of similar ingredients (typical for Latin restaurants). It's also cool they have beers including craft and local options. You don't often find this with counter service, but I dig it.  You can put a healthier take on Latin than traditional places, as chips and salsa do not come standard so you have to consciously decide if you're going that route - helps with willpower!   There are quinoa options for your starch and shredded or fajita chicken to ensure you get the right type for your pallet.   The salsa bar is my favorite part, as you really can customize the flavor by adding the correct one(s) to your already flavor packed dish. I've tried them all and it's hard to go wrong. Great establishment - all locations!  They also have specials! Woo!  Monday $6 Three Amigo Burrito $2.50 Mexican Beers  Tuesday $1 Taco Tuesday  Wednesday Kids eat free  Thursday $7 Arepa & Empanada $5 Mojitos  Friday $5 Margaritas  Saturday Craft beer specials  Sunday $2.00 Domestic Beers  Mon-Fri 3-5PM $1 Taco Autenticos  You won't be disappointed!",

I like this location better than the other ones just because it felt more reserved. Meaning there was less people and not on a busy street. I enjoyed my food outside in their seating area.   I ordered an arepa with shredded chicken, yuca frita and carne asada tacos. I have to say the arepa was by far the best. The shredded chicken was flavorful and the sauce that they drizzle in it gave it a cooling taste which balances just right. The yuca frita was also a hit! I loved that there was a crunch on every bite! Lastly, the tacos that were honestly not that great because majority of the meat was fat. It became difficult to chew and actually enjoy what tacos are meant to be.   Overall, I know what to order and what not to order for my next visit. Love the multi-cultures that this restaurant makes up to be.",

Pretty much the same quality food as other Sabors, though my boyfriend said he thought his three amigos burrito was his favorite among the locations we've been to. The owner of another location I reviewed told me that if you check-in, you get free chips! My boyfriend did that to see if the same applies here and it does! Total game changer since the salsa bar is clutch. Every Sabor I've been to has the same salsa, but they always taste different which is cool since that means they're most likely freshly made. The ones here were very good and seemed spicier than other locations. The beer selection is better here than others, with lots of local options, but they seemed like pretty generic options and not many seasonal choices. The employees here seemed a bit grumpy, but it's fast casual so really not a big deal.  Let's be real, you can't go wrong with any Sabor and this is one of the top ones in the area!",

I ordered a burrito bowl, plus chips and queso, though a delivery app. The wait time was quoted as less than thirty minutes and that was pretty spot on.   Since the delivery address was a hotel, I expected utensils to be included, but they weren't. I had to track some down through my hotel. Also, my order wasn't totally accurate; there was shredded cheese, which I did not request, and the bowl was missing jalapenos and a side of hot sauce, which I did request.   Despite the slightly off order, the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The portion size of the bowl (and serving of chips) was enormous. I'd order from Sabor again.",

Sure everyone loves their $1 tacos on Tuesday, but their empanadas, burritos, and nachos are all delicious and deserve their own praise.   It's simple, good Mexican food. The empanadas are probably my favorite and most filling, inexpensive option on the menu, but I'm also a huge fan of the build your own options. All their ingredients are fresh, flavorful and there's a sense of care that comes with everything they make. They have traditional tacos with cilantro and onions as well as American tacos - all with your choice of fillings. My favorites are the chorizo and grilled chicken, but the ground beef is also solid. Plus they have a salsa bar! A delicious, multi-tiered spice level salsa bar!   I will say the seating at this location is limited, and can be overwhelming when in line, but I've never had a problem finding a spot to enjoy my delicious food!",

The order taker at the register was very friendly and helped my party with ordering. When I checked in on Yelp, I received a coupon for free chips! Winning!!!!   The chips were hot, fresh, seasoned, and they have a free salsa bar that you can use at your convenience with sauces ranging from mild to spicy habernero. I even saw a pineapple salsa on their salsa bar.   My party ordered two nachos! They were huge!! I can't believe how much food was given for like $8. You can't beat this place. Not only is the price right, the food was absolutely delicious. Their guacamole and queso was outstanding!  I left this place tipsy and full! I can't wait to go back!!!!",

It was kind of packed so I did not get the opportunity to indulge in the atmosphere. Plus I was in a rush because I parked illegally because there was no where to park. But any who my daughter wanted nachos so nachos we found. And nachos we received! I ordered the chicken nachos with a side of Mexican rice, yuca fries, and the beef taco. Yes it was taco Tuesday! The amount of food that I received was great! And the taste was even better. The meat was very well seasoned and the chips did not get soggy really fast. The rice was okay. The beef taco was a little different in taste but that is what made it great. I squeezed some lime juice on it and it was on point. I am in love with yuca fries so I am so glad that I found some that were amazing. My daughter ate everything that we ordered! I ordered take out. I was told my order would be ready at a certain time and it was ready and waiting on me! Can't wait to go back. Hope you enjoy as much as I did!",

Depending on which location you go to, parking can be difficult in NoDa, but there is a designated parking lot in Elizabeth. Also, seating in NoDa is a bit cramped but in Elizabeth it's more spread out. I can't speak to the Southpark location, but I'm sure I'll end up there eventually!",

Decor: Understated but home-y that helps bring that authentic atmosphere. Clean.   Food: Cheap, small portions but surprisingly super filling. My boyfriend had the arepa; I had two black bean taco autenticos, and we both had the corn. Everything tasted delicious. However, I expected more from the elote loco as I hoped it rivaled Cafe Habana in NYC. Maybe less mayo and more chili powder? Quick tip: squeeze some lime onto the corn to bring the flavors up another level. The salsa bar is pretty awesome and the jalapeno verde had good heat.   Service: very nice staff. And quick to get our food.   Overall, very good experience and will most likely stop by again!",

They have daily specials, craft beers, super friendly staff who know my name (probably from my frequent visits). The tacos are great, but I've become partial to the shredded chicken quesadilla and Arepa. If you're a burrito person, the Three Amigos Burrito is my favorite and will fill you up fast. Expect long lines, sometimes out the door, on Tuesday. Seating is bumpy (they're addressing this) and if your cell power is running low, bring your charging cord and sit at a booth as they have USB ports on the wall at each one. They have a tip line when you place your order at the counter, don't be a cheapskate, add at least a few bucks. These people share it and they work hard to turn the tables, ring you up quickly and to keep that delicious Latin Street food coming at lightning speed. Love this place!!!! Note: there are several locations and I've been to a couple. They're all consistently good. Tip: check in on YELP when you get there and you get FREE chips. Just order a small queso dip or guac and you're set.",

The arepas are great although very different from traditional arepas . The yuka fries are great as well as the supreme nachos. While the food is great, the service is sometimes inconsistent. Mistakes happen for sure so I get that but on several instances I've received the wrong order or perhaps have gone without receiving something in my order. I will say that they always correct any error that has been made though without any problems which is appreciated and recognized. It just seems like their is a miscommunication from the register to the kitchen sometimes. All in all, it is absolutely worth going to and you will not be disappointed with anything you order.

I got 3 tacos and 1 arepa, the food was really good but I don't think I'll be waiting another 45 minutes for some tacos, especially when the concept of the restaurant is fast food.   The tables were really dirty and no one was checking this aspect of the place after people were leaving their tables. I think that it has great potential if it's properly staffed and some training is involved for customer service.

    "text": "I have eaten tacos all across this great nation. I mean from Southern California to Charlotte, up to Manhattan and on down to Sarasota. I've eaten at nearly every Mexican and \"Mexican\" restaurant in Charlotte and been routinely disappointed. The street tacos here are some of the best I've ever had. Easily the second best I've had on the East Coast.  My first visit there, I tried the Arepas which was absolutely amazing. Stuffed to the brim with stewed chicken and cheese. My only criticism is that the cheese is only on the top. The sauce I could take or leave. It's a bit like Thousand Island. I also had a Gordita, and let me tell you that it's about as close as you're going to get to a True Gordita anywhere. Delicious tortilla, amazing filling and served piping hot! I also had the queso dip, which is tasty if not a bit pedestrian. Pro tip: dump a cup of well-drained Pico De Gallo into the queso.  My second visit was all about street tacos and guacamole. I've had a hard mothamonkey time finding decent guacamole in the south, but here it is. Fresh. No \"turned\" avocado. Plenty of it for the price. Delicious. I had the shredded chicken, a fish and an Al Pastor taco. All amazing. The chicken is the same stewed chicken used in the Arepas. The Al Pastor was slightly tangy and wonderful to behold. The fish was good but not memorable.  The salsas. I am a salsa fanatic. I eat Pico De Gallo weekly. The HOT Pico (yes you have a choice) is truly incredible. You can actually make out the flavor of the jalapenos, which is not always the case at some \"Mexican\" restaurants. Especially in the south. The ingredients are all fresh, not pickled (ai dios mio why do they do that?). There are many other varieties including a couple of excellent tomatillos and a habanero derivative. Bring your big boy/girl britches. They are not to be taken lightly.  Criticisms: The day that I came for tacos, the person cooking used WAY too much oil. This was not the case the first time around, so they need to get consistent. The place could be a bit cleaner, the staff could be a bit more outgoing and for the love of Jesus de Cristo get a Horchata fountain.  Enjoy!",

While I can't say that for this place but yelp currently doesn't have a 4.5 rating scale so I will be rounding down to 4.   The restaurant in itself is a no frills place but what more than makes up for it is the fantastic food. Combining different Latin cultures the menu is a smorgasbord of different cuisines that would satisfy your cravings.  We had gluten free and vegan requirements in our group and this place can serve both. Corn tortillas for the gluten free and tofu for vegan option. I myself had the arepa and shredded chicken authenticos taco (which basically is a corn tortilla taco) and it was amazing. The melted cheese and sauces combined with the slow cooked marinated meat made for a great taco!  They also have a salsa bar for different types and heat levels of salsa. Monday's also have $2 Mexican Beers.   All in all a great visit and will definitely be returning.",

So when my friend told me about this place she'd been dying to try because they have $1 tacos on Tuesday nights, I knew immediately where she was talking about. I am glad I finally got to try this place out because it is now going to be one of those places I'm going to be at over and over again. I had the chicken taco and beef authenticos taco and the beef was by far my favorite (not that the chicken was bad at all). It was uniquely flavored with a delicious tortilla. I also splurged and got an empenada and I was glad I did because it was incredible. I have also been told to come back for the nachos but there are several other things I want to try. Plus if I go back on a Tuesday or any day 3-5 PM I can order anything and if I happen not like it (seemingly little chance of that happening), I can do the $1 tacos as backup and know that I will be content.",

The line is always out the door if you come at normal dinner times, especially the dollar taco day where you save even more on an already well priced delicious taco. The elote is the least healthy corn option I have ever seen, but it's good. I just went to Mexico and it was cool to see it down there, too.

This doesn't actually bother me that much, but it can be a little on the grimy side. On the plus side though, in addition to delicious food, the staff are always accommodating about fixing my orders. It adds about 10 minutes to my wait, and it can suck when my friend's order comes out fine the first time around and we have to wait for mine (or vice versa) but they do always correct it.

I've tried a few things on the menu, but from now on it'll be super hard for me to stray from the nachos. They are huge, cheesy, and excellent! Two can share the nachos as I learned when my mother and I went for dinner. I ordered one of the burritos, she ordered the nachos with steak and elote loco (street corn). Needless to say, I boxed my burrito and we shared the nachos and the corn. Not kidding, when we sat it down on the tiny table for two everyone in the place was staring like they wanted a bite. You have to have to have to get one of the street corns... It is life altering. You will lick the tray clean.",

A friend swears by the shredded chicken but I'm not even sure why it exists when grilled is an option.  If you order a burrito you can ask that they press it on the grill which makes it's extra killer.    They do have some issues with keeping the place clean but I don't really care as the food it awesome.  Also the pink sauce from the salsa bar is hot as hell, be careful with it.",

When we arrived, the place was busy, but not to the point where it was annoying. We only waited about 5 minutes in line before we ordered, and decided to try a variety of items.  SUPER friendly employees, courteous and eager to please. In about 10 minutes we received our food which consisted of chips and salsa (from the salsa bar omg so good) Dominican nachos, an arepa, a beef empanada, and this amazing corn on the cob creation.  First of all we will start by saying that everything was delicious. We found the arepa to be a bit on the greasy side, but all in all was delicious. The Dominican nachos were fantastic with fresh ingredients and delicious fried yuca on the bottom- not to mention the portion size was HUGE. By far our favorite item was the empanada- so simple yet so beautifully crafted.  The house margaritas were sufficient, you can't go wrong for $4 each on a Friday night.  Lastly we decided to splurge and get some churros for dessert.... They were filled with a dulce de Leche cream, and if I didn't feel like I was going to explode I would have devoured them all.",

We also split a horcheta, a rice milk drink concoction. All were good.   This is definitely a place to go back to on a non-work day, the beer bottle selection looked interesting.",

I'm a huge fan of Three Amigos and was really excited about this place.   The restaurant was pretty empty when I walked in. I ordered up the tofu burrito but they didn't have any tofu ready so instead I got a veggie burrito.   The restaurant itself is nothing much to look at. You go up and order at the front counter and there are booths against the wall to eat at.  They had a little salsa bar in the back which was cool.   The staff here was very friendly. The kitchen is open so you can watch them cook your food. I decided to get my food to go. The queso wasn't very hot, my burrito though was huge. I enjoyed the zucchini that they put in the burrito but overall there really wasn't anything special about it. The chips were just like Three Amigos and are always awesome  The hot green salsa is my favorite, and their mild salsa is also super fresh and tasty.  I would give this place another shot and maybe try more of the Latin street food dishes. It just didn't wow me like Three Amigos.",

    "text": "Let me tell you, Sabor is a small place that's mucho GRANDE in flavor.  My friend and I went on Friday afternoon which also happened to be #NationalTequilaDay (*praise hands emoji*) so our imbibing of the $4 margaritas was quite fitting and delicious. I easily sucked mine down and could've had another if I didn't have plans to drive afterward. Being that it was just after 5:00 p.m., it wasn't busy so we were able to walk right in and place our orders.  I went with the chicken empanada, fish taco, and large serving of guacamole to share. My friend ordered the chorizo empanada and a chicken arepa. While we waited, we took a sampling of the salsa bar. Definitely was not impressed with the mild salsa flavor which tasted more like salsa water. All of the salsas seemed like they had been sitting out for a while so we stuck with the guac.  Initially, I was a little taken by surprise at the size of the empanada but soon that turned into gratitude because I ate every single bite and wished that it would magically double in size. The dough was lightly crispy and the chicken was juicy and flavorful and I need another one right now.  The fish taco fell apart on me but I just picked up a fork and ate the insides. It was all right but not anything I would order again. I tried a piece of my friend's arepa and thought it was good but nothing particularly stood out for me.   I want to thank Sabor for my newly-found adoration for empanadas.",

There's that time frame that's ideal and then beyond that, you're standing in a line that is out the door and down the sidewalk (it's totally worth it in every way). As per usual, I ordered 3 tacos -- 2 beef and 1 chicken. The fresh corn tortillas are always so delicious and the taco fillings themselves have excellent flavor. Despite the line length, the staff does a great job of moving people through.   One thing I do love is the presentation of the food. Unlike many places, your tacos come out on a round tin pan (kind of like a pizza pan) laid out flat. This makes it easy to add salsa (there are a variety of free salsas near the drink area) or pour some queso on top. I always get a small queso for dressing my tacos. If I'm being completely honest here, I wish queso ran through my veins. ANYWAY, their queso is on point and I love drizzling it all over my tacos. I also tried the yucca fries for the first time - they were delicious.",

The fish taco was nice, but the autenticos with pollo were bland. Both seemed dry and uninspired.   The queso was SO bland. It tasted like triangles of Laughing Cow cheese product that were heated far too long in the microwave. The arepa was pretty good - but, again, just very DRY.  I had to wait until I was nearly done with my food for my $10 Margarita (\"Sorry, we forgot\").  The employees were nice, but service was chaotic at best. I wouldn't want to be there when it's busy, based on the chaos inspired by 3-4 occupied tables.",

The carne Asada fries were alright, the fries weren't cooked all the way and the steak was over cooked so not the best combo. Edible but I would not order again. Chips and queso were delicious! Counter service was rude but I won't judge a place on one employee. The best part, and the main reason this gets 4 stars, was the authentic margarita. At $5.95 it was perfect, not sweet and sugary like the drinks made from mix. Will absolutely be back to try the other food and drink more margaritas! I left with a full belly and wallet",

You know what I would have been left with? Tomato and cheese in an arepa for $4.25. Yep.  My coworker got a burrito and a soda. But, guess what? He is diabetic and they were out of diet soda (along with two others). Of course he didn't find out until after he paid and went to get said soda.   They magically found some chicken, so my arepa was saved. I did have to clean off my own table. I'll probably give this place another chance, but damn.

The Empanadas are a close second.  The Arepas (papusas) are so filling...but I think they are an acquired taste for most Americans.  I'm going back to sample the rest...can't wait.

My latest trip there I had 2 ground beef tacos and 1 shrimp taco. They were so good and so much filling I could barely closed the taco. I was so stuff that I couldn't even eat what I spilled out on my plate. My wife order the nacho with stake. I was so much she want me to help eat and I couldn't. I love on Friday night margaritas are on special. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "4 stars for staff friendliness, good ambiance, good crowd (other families there), safe location, and cleanliness.  3 stars for food: my wife, Puerto Rican, and I love Mexican food (for obvious reasons).  Checked this place out and food was OK, nothing to rave about (I know everyone's taste buds are different),  We ordered a variety to try: all 3 tacos, arepas, empanadas, chips and queso.    TACOS: the taco's were ok (I'm biased, i love hard shell tacos), these were flour and corn tortillas, and I got a combination of beef and steak; definitely was a lot of meat (if you like that), but I like good ratio of meat to added toppings - as a result of meat overload, food was bland, could have used more of the fresh toppings (cilantro, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.).      AREPA: Next, the arepa, which was just one big sandwhich of pulled chicken and cheese, nothing special besides the bun.    EMPANADA: The empanada was probably the best, although mostly beef (again) and deep fried... the sauce definitely made it awesome though.    CHIPS AND QUASO: NOT free, which is my biggest criticism.  Not that I want free stuff or I'm cheap, it's just kind of become an \"industry standard\" in my opinion, like bread at restaurants.  Finally, queso was average.    Last point, they DO have a salsa bar, which i love in general, so thumbs up to that.  Conclusion: I would go back for the family-friendly environment and *OK* Mexican food, but only if it was the closest option and I was lazy to venture further.    Advice to restaurant: add more seasoning and fresh flavors and not just load everything up with meat meat meat!  Other than that, everything else is good :)",

    "text": "This is one of those places you don't even realize is there. I assumed even with GPS we were going the wrong way.   Came in at 12p on a Monday for lunch. Our order was taken pretty quickly. First time visiting any place that strictly relied on the use of IPADs for payment. This was definitely a neat thing to see. When we came in to the restaurant there was one other person. By the time our food was placed there were 4 other groups which was a good sign for me. We ordered chips, our name was called my hubby attempted to grab them and another customer stood there licking her fingers and grabbed pur plate. He attempted to explain to her but she insisted they were hers. She was incorrect. Not a fault of the restaurant but when we attempted to tell the two female employees who were standing there as our name was called they basically shrugged us off. It was busy and there were several orders being called at once.  My suggestion when a name is called stay there long enough to be sure the right person grabs the right food.  That way they can be sure to eat their items as appetizers if intended to do so.  We ordered the Dominican burritio and especial. Both were cooked to order and huge! The ingredients also tasted fresh. What I liked is though the menu was basic the flavor combinations offered were something I've never seen. My burrito had cabbage and chicken with this great cream sauce which tasted like it did have tomato in it but it had a great flavor. The chips were also made to order and we tried the Pico De gallo which was off to the side at a salsa bar. It was good but I also think it could have had slightly more cilantro. I would have liked to see more hot flavors. The salsas in my opinion were all very mild  The hot sauce wasn't truly hot. This would be something I would have expected to see especially since there was a salsa bar. The prices are great but I didn't notice any lunch options as far as sales with items that could be combined with chips for a cheaper price. This wasn't a big deal because the portion sizes compared to food offered was great and food can easily be split with someone.   When I've eaten at certain restaurants I can usually judge the amount of sodium used based on my thirst the rest of the day. I can't seem to get enough water. It was a great sign for me when this wasn't the case after eating at Sabor.  Overall we enjoyed the food and will revisit. We have tried several Mexican restaurants and this was by far the best burritos we have had since moving out to the Carolina area in 2006.",

    "text": "A solid 3-stars, for now, as Sabor finds its footing and introduces the uptown crowd to a mix of Latin-inspired street food, while also serving well-known Mexican staples in an informal and relatively fast-service eatery.    Stopped in for lunch during their first week 'soft opening' and liked the openness of the space, even while a few odds and ends related to the up fit were still 'in progress.'   Upbeat latin music (think salsa and meringue) played overhead and had several diners (literally) dancing in their seats.  You order from large-screen video boards above a counter and the kitchen space is directly behind.  Drinks are self-serve, as is the salsa bar (more on that below).  You'll see all the regular suspects there such as a range of burritos, quesadillas, and tacos (served in both a corn and a flour shell) with different meats and toppings to choose from.  But the 'something different' here is the selection of arepas, papusas, empanadas, and even gorditas.  If you've never had these things below, all are worth exploring after checking out the explanations on the menu video boards.  These items are staples over most of latin-america and have been sorely lacking in the mainstream Charlotte scene.  On my visit in, I had a couple different tacos authenticos (made with the corn soft shell) and the vegetable papusas.  The tacos were fantastic, rightly proportioned for the shell size and bursting with flavor even without the use of the salsa bar.  The papusas were mightily portioned and chock full of cheese and veggies.  I was disappointed, however, that a corn meal used instead of a finer ground masa.  The texture was a bit rougher than I am used to with papusa, and was much more like an arepa.  I was also surprised there was not a more traditional papusa with a shredded pork filling.  I get that recipes can differ, just things to know for next time.  I also hope the kitchen staff works together a bit better, as my taco order was ready well in advance of my papusas, which were only ready after the server I had tried to give me an order of gorditas, without knowing the difference between the two.  Training and time should work this out, however.    Chips are a separate menu item and are not served free here.  At $0.95 for an small order, however, it's hard to complain as my chips were freshly made and still quite warm.  You should order the same, however, if for no other reason than a trip to the salsa bar, which, IMHO, puts just about every other chain-restaurant salsa bar to shame.  A 'hot and spicy' salsa that truly lives up to the name?  Yes!  The hot version had the heat, my friends, and left me with small tears of joy (and fire) as I dug another chip in to confirm what my taste buds first sang to me.  Contrast that with the smooth and chilled taste of their salsa verde, made creamy with the pureed avocado.  Both are worth the trip alone.  There are a couple other salsa and pico de gallo selections there too, so do explore here and find your own favorites.  Sabor holds much promise and I hope word gets out soon as the location is just far enough off the more heavily-travelled 7th Street that it won't get a lot of drive-by traffic.  I can easily say, however, this eatery is a nice alternative to the burrito chains around town and offers far more authentic flavors at easily comparable prices.  Viva Sabor, a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I love three amigos...Sabor wasn't as good to me. The prices are fantastic, great location and great for a quick lunch. The inside needs a little more sprucing up but, it works for street food. I had the Build Your Own Burrito with chicken, shrimp, rice, shredded cheese and cilantro. Everything was hot and fresh but lacking in flavor. The rice was \"Spanish\" style with tomatoes, corn, onions and other things. Thanks goodness I had the cilantro in there to add a pop of freshness and flavor. I was expecting a lot more Latin flare. One of my lunch guest had the Sabor burrito and felt the same way. Pretty bland. My other lunch guest had the shredded chicken quesadilla...left much to be desired. When I think \"Latin\", I feel like my taste buds shouldn't know what hit them!! They have $4-9 Margaritas and .99$ tacos Mon.-Fri. 3-5. Pretty good deal. Just pump up the flavor!!",

If you have never had an Arpea which are grilled corn cake tortillas filled with grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes and onions, I highly suggest trying one.   The Dominican nachos: Yuca fries smothered in shredded chicken, pico de gallo, cabbage and sabor pink sauce are also another one of my favorites. The nachos are HUGE. They also have a salsa bar that consists of 5-6 salsas all fresh and tasty.  This place opened my taste buds to Latin street foods done right and I am very fortunate and grateful. Go check this place out you will not regret it.",

    "text": "Latin street food off the street! Similar concept to Chipotle in dining experience and food quality, but for half the price. Authentic and fresh, this is one of the best places to eat cheap. I normally order online and pick it up in 15-20 minutes, which is super convenient. Chips cost extra but it's only $1.50 versus $3.25 at Chipotle. The salsa bar caters to 3-4 different levels of spice  like my Mom says, if it doesn't make you sweat, it ain't hot enough. They've got salsa that will spark joy (and fire) into your taste buds. If you haven't yet tried Sabor, I highly recommend giving any one of their tacos a try ($3 per taco isn't bad). The only downside is the size of the restaurant. Too small for the volume of business around dinner hours. However, it's a quick and easy way to please your family if you choose to order everyones dinner online on your way home from work.",

The location has seen some instability in the past but with the opening of Sabor we're hoping this is one restaurant thats here to stay. We've hit them up at least once a week since the opening and love it more and more with every visit.  They're ran by the same guys as Three Amigos and the menu features normal favorites like burritos, tacos, quesadillas as well as arepas, elote loco, and sabortias. Our top picks... get the nachos and head over on taco Tuesday (only $1). Sabor is bringing great street food to the Elizabeth neighborhood and its worth giving a shot.",

Between the prices and quality of food, there is no replacement.  The quesadillas are great, burritos are excellent, and most of all, the elote loco is unlike anything I've had at any other Mexican place.  Sabor, if you're listening, please open a location in Huntersville!!  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the difference in quality of food between the Elizabeth location and the NoDa location.  For example, the Elote Loco at Elizabeth is the one I talked about in this review.  If I had only had the Elote loco from the NoDa location, i don't know if i would have been singing its praises...",

Well, the system that they have in place, off an iPad, is a little slow so it takes a bit to order.  There were about 5 people ahead of us, which at least meant that the food would be good.  After ordering and waiting about 20 minutes for our food to be ready, we finally got to eat.  The tacos were really awesome.  I got the authenticos of chicken (got to go with green verde salsa on this one!), steak (the spicy dark salsa is really good here!), and chorizo (you cut it with some of the pink cremy salsa - if you can call it that).  All delicioso, boy!  Watch out for the shrimp taco - it'll run you some cash-money... and it ain't even the fancy shrimp.  That aside, Johan V* said the shrimp taco was amazing. \"Four bucks for the shrimp taco?  Price ain't shrimp-y, that's for sure.\" :X  Also, I had one of the Mexican cokes, but I don't get it.  Does it taste better? It tastes pretty much like regular coke to me.  What does it say about my taste buds?

It was odd because to add peppers/onions was an upcharge and my order had them on half of it, even though I didn't order them. My quesadilla was okay. I've had much better for the same price range. My colleague loved her taco salad though. The portion size was generous.   All in all, I don't understand the hype. It wasn't a bad meal by any means, though.",

It was shortly before closing so I know it was rushed but the food was unacceptable. I spent $40 for 3 tacos, the corn on the cob and a chicken quesadilla. The quesadillas were extremely oily, had huge pieces of uncooked chopped unions and peppers in it and what made it worse was that it was so soggy, I had to eat it with a fork when I got home. The shrimp tacos were extremely salty and instead of cutting up added avocado, it looked like the cook just got lazy and slices a whole avocado and threw it on the small taco. I have been here a bunch of times and never had this experience yet just because they were closing soon does not mean provide unacceptable customer service and get sloppy with the food. I definitely recommend going to Sabor but maybe just another location.",

I think I was so psyched up for it because of the rave reviews, and it just didn't deliver. (to be fair, part of my disappointment was that $1 tacos only include corn tortillas, not flour. I'm a gringo... gimme my damn flour shells).  This past week, I felt it was time to give Sabor a shot a redemption. I'm glad to say I left much happier this time around. I got a shredded chicken, ground beef & a veggie taco (reluctantly on corn tortillas). The chicken is awesome (especially with the pineapple salsa) and the beef is fantastic (especially with their spicy ranch-y style sauce). The veggie taco was just alright, in my honest opinion... nothing special or yummy flavor to it. That whole salsa bar was just better this time,too. The pineapple salsa is great, as is their medium green salsa. We opted for queso & chips again. The queso has a great flavor, but it's basically the consistency of water. I've never seen queso so thin before, it was almost hard to eat without dripping everywhere.   I must have been in a bad mood last time, because this was a complete 180 experience. I would definitely be back for Taco Tuesday, and definitively to try their 'normal' menu.",

    "text": "Their name is Sabor (for you gringos Sabor means flavor/taste in Spanish ) and my goodness does this place live up to their name. Their name should really be El Sabor Mas Rico y Perfecto en Todo El Mundo because this place is spot on when in comes to capturing the True sabor of Latin Street Food.   When you walk in you can tell this place is the real deal. Latin flavor fills the room. The boards are chocked full of Latin Street Food Favorites: Tacos, Arepas, Empanadas, Elote, etc.  (I just named all my favorites). Thankfully, I came here on a Thursday at 4pm when the 3-5pm $1 Taco and Thursday's $6 arepa and empanada special were going on. On top of that, I had a Yelp check-in offer for free chips. Altogether I ended up ordering: the chicken arepa, beef empanada, Queso, chips and a Colombiana and it cost me under $10. Unfortunately, I had to make the tough decision to save the Elote and tacos for another time (tears, sniffles).   After collecting some delicious house made salsas off of their complementary, chilled salsa bar (I opted for the verde and spicy pineapple), I settled in to my chair with my super lofty expectations hovering above me.   (A little background here: In my family empanadas are serious business: my cousin and my cousin's wife's Mom (keep up with me here) have this unspoken competition around who makes the best empanadas/pastelitos. Every holiday/family gathering, they are hashing it out over the empanadas. Each of them goes around the room watching each person savor their first bite hoping to be professed the family champ (Which no one ever does because duh then we wouldn't get twice the empanadas every holiday. Whose going to stop that gravy train???) I LOVE empanadas. I could eat them everyday forever and never tire of them. I eat them EVERYWHERE I travel including abroad. I just thought you should have some context here.)  After about 7 minutes, my feast arrived in all of its glory and splendor. I took my necessary pictures (you're welcome) and dug in to the arepa first. This delectable masterpiece is stuffed to the gills with flavor. The meat was moist and juicy, the sauces and toppings melded perfectly and packed a punch without overwhelming the palette.  The True star here was the arepa itself. It was flavorful, hot, perfectly crisp with the right amount of softness. It was heavenly.  I couldn't stop eating it. I wanted to move on to everything else but I couldn't pull myself away even though I knew I was getting full!  When I was almost to the end, I moved on to the empanada.  I bit in and while delicious but it wasn't beef it was chicken. I am super biased to beef empanadas so I had to let them know. They were super generous and let me keep the tasty chicken and made the beef fresh.   Wanting to save room for my beloved empanada,  I decided to chill with the arepa and nosh on my chips and queso instead. I truly love chips and queso (despite queso's mostly American roots....honestly I just love melted American cheese, so shoot me). This dip was perfectly creamy and smooth and served piping hot. It was fabulous but the chips stole the show. Served warm, they were perfectly crispy but not greasy or over cooked and tossed in house seasoning.   After 3/4 of the arepa, chips, Queso plus some of my Colombiana and a ton of water, I knew I was nearing my belly's end but I couldn't leave without tasting my beef empanada. Sure enough it came out right on time (cue angelic music). This one was even more beautiful than the last. A bit browner with the light sheen of warm oil still enveloping it, she was a sight to behold (sorry no picture...I was in a state of complete euphoria by this time).   I took a deep breath and bit in and fireworks started to explode. The crispy pastry shell lead the way followed by the piping hot and flavorful ground beef and cheese filling, and laden with authentic flavor. It was truly outstanding. I was completely blown away. Definitely the best pastelito I've ever had (given my author's note this is no small claim). It was perfectly fried, stuffed AND seasoned and (yes my Latinos) greasy juice was coming out of the bottom!!!  I normally get three of the above criteria met...but all, almost never, only here at Sabor.   After reveling in the glory of my my first truly great Yelp! find here in Charlotte and literally prying the empanada from my own hands, I decided to take the rest of my feast in a doggy bag that could easily last me a day and a half!!!   I always know when I've truly had a first rate experience because I'm beaming. I always tell the staff about it and then I have to relive every detail for my fellow Yelpers! (Ok, Ok for myself too!)   This place gets my official stamp of approval. So YOU, (si, tu) looking at this review and still wondering if it would be worth it, put down the phone, get in the car and drive on two wheels, ehem, I mean very safely and cautiously to get some of this Sabor Latino!!",

On the other hand, you have Sabor's Dominican Nachos and Arepas. What's a girl to do?! Seriously.   On those days Sabor wins out, we are never disappointed. A few years ago, this spot was a little hit or miss. Sometimes it was awesome and other times food was cold or not what you ordered, etc. As they've gained popularity they've really hit their stride, though.   I love, love, love the Arepas, Dominican nachos (with yucca instead of chips) and regular nachos (with chips). Guac and queso are good. The salsa bar is a fun touch. Excellent beer/alcohol selection with frequent drink specials. The Elizabeth location is much better than the new NoDa spot. I'm hoping that 2nd location hits their stride just like this one did.",

    "text": "Looking for fresh, simply dressed Mexican cuisine on the fly?  This is your place!  This isn't your typical sit down with table service Mexican restaurant boasting an overwhelming menu that you can barely understand.  It's simple tacos and burritos made to order with the freshest ingredients.  Chips and house-made salsas are available at the salsa bar with varied levels of heat.  Taco bowls and salads, as well as a few other simpler Latin dishes are available.  Several beers are on hand, thanks to NoDa's very own Salud Beer Shop, but if that's not your gig, they can whip you up an inexpensive margarita too.  Place your order at the counter before grabbing your fountain drink and salsa, then find your seat.  Only a couple of outdoor tables are available outside the front entrance.  The line may be long, but it moves fairly quickly.  This isn't the place where people sit to socialize for hours either, so don't get discouraged if you cannot spot an available table at first.  They tend to turn rather quickly and there will likely be one for you to snag by the time your order is complete.    The tables inside each have an outlet available with USB ports to get a quick charge while you eat.  Feed your gut and fuel your phone!  Watch out for the dip in the floor along the booth side.  Single restrooms are available near the back.  Clear your own table, but be sure not to toss the trays in the trash.  The lunch rush is hectic, as can be dinner hour, and the parking lot is rather small.  They are adjacent to a small shopping center which shares the lot.  On dollar taco Tuesday's, forget about it!  If you're in walking distance, it's better to do so during the busier times.  It's a quick walk for most Elizabeth residents.  It's also a great place to grab a taco to eat while you walk through Independence Park across the street.  Tip - Yelpers get free chips with check-in!",

They are quick fix for good Latin street food and a slowly multiplying all over Charlotte. My go to is the chicken arepa slathered in the notorious pineapple habanero salsa. If you're hungry, go for the nachos, which are built for hunger... to the yucca nachos... built for flavor.   The service is always friendly, transactional... but super friendly. Their daily specials are also a good way to try out new things.  I'm a big, big fan.",

I love to grab Pacifico or Pacifica whenever I go. The guacamole is delicious as well. There's also an assortment of salsas to try but I stick to mild.",

Drove to Hawthorne Lane location.  No parking. Wound up eating at Hawthorne's pizza.  No, I do not work for Hawthorne's Pizza.  By the way, my husband and I walked to Sabor two nights ago in NoDa and it took us about 30 minutes to get our food.  No wonder there's no parking.  Everyone is waiting on the kitchen:",

The atmosphere of Sabor is even more casual than it's sister restaurant. You order at the front and sit down until your name is called. They have a simple menu, choosing quality over quantity. Anything you'd want on the menu is on there, and nothing extra is cluttering the menu.   They do have beer, wine and margaritas. I haven't had the margaritas but I am always impressed by their craft beer selection. And on Saturdays the local craft beers are half priced. :)  My favorite part of this place is probably the fresh salsa bar. The salsa is made fresh daily and you can really tell. The salsas are full of flavor, from the most mild classic tomato salsa to the fire-in-your-mouth pineapple habanero salsa.   This\"street food\" spot has become one of our weekend go to locations. We'll be back again and again, and already have been.",

I naturally got all the sauces too. Sabor also has margaritas, strong ones, which makes them a perfect way to start the night off. Oh and they're good on the flavor side of things too haha.

Anyways, it was taco tuesday! $1 tacos all day (they also have $1 tacos Monday - Friday from 3pm-5pm). I ordered two ground beef tacos and one chicken taco while my fiance ordered one beef and one chicken. They have a salsa bar ranging from mild to hot. You can take a little or a lot of whatever salad you love the best! Anyways, once we were done eating we decided to get more because they were so good! This time we ordered all ground beef. The shredded chicken seemed to be a bit dry for me. Anyways, I ended up eating 6 tacos myself! And although there are no \"servers\" because you order at a counter, a young lady checked on us several times to make sure we were doing alright and to clear our trays when we were done.  I will definitely be going back! They are suppose to be opening one near my work, and I cannot wait. Tacos every week then!",

Why would a customer expect they actually had to CHOOSE those things when ordering if it clearly states they come on the dish?! So I now sit here with a $13 box full of a maybe one scoop of rice, meat and black beans with at least the guacamole I paid extra for. Zero lettuce, onion, tomato, cheese, cilantro. Gross. Also no Togo silverware so now I don't even have a way to eat it. When I called to question and complain about my food I was told it was the uber eats drivers responsibility to put to go silverware in the bag. I'm sorry but what? It's your job to bag the food up properly. No apology until I asked for one and then was told they couldn't give me a refund because I had to go through uber eats for that. Nope. again not how it works. I've managed restaurants for years and have literally driven food to a customer myself because their order was wrong if they could it come pick up an order I had remade for them and then comped because it was WRONG or the menu wasn't clear. Bad job y'all. Seriously won't be ordering from you again after this experience.",

    "text": "Yum city! If you are looking for some banging street tacos, a sizeable amount of guac and a little happy hour action, Sabor Latin Street Grill is your place!   The Meat: You order at the counter. Street tacos, you add your protein. Be warned fellow vegetarians, tofu is an extra $1 which is outrageous, so opt for the grilled veggies. Breakdown on the extras: + $2 Grilled Talapia; Grilled Shrimp and +$1 Grilled Steak, Chorizo Sausage, Al Pastor Pork, Tofu Ranchero. I was disappointed with the $1 extra for my tofu because it's really inexpensive. It's not hard to make, and there were about four tiny bites in the street taco. Grilled veggies or cheese are the way to go if you are opting for the veg.  Pro tip:  Gauc sides are incredible. Just ask to see what a large looks like because it's well worth the $4.95. If you check in on Yelp, you get free chips and if you purchase a side of gauc, queso or pico (large or XL) your chips are free, too.   Happy hour: Yes, you heard that right...happy hour. You can choose between mixed drinks: Dark & Stormy, Mohito, Palmoa or a marg and they also have beers. We opted for the $4 margs during Friday Happy Hour, but if you are looking for something amazing and a little more than mix, go for a beer. It's a $4 marg, so I can't be mad and I should have expected mostly mix and light tequila, but hey, you never know.  Get the tacos, skip the tofu and the margs.",

    "text": "Us Charlotteans love some Sabor! Delicious concoctions of the Tex-Mex variety. The \"Epic Protein Bowl\" was my intro into the Sabor world. A mish-mash of grains and meat with seasonings and sauces to boot. It wasn't long til I moved along to the other offerings. The more vegan friend alternative bowl with avocado in it (though I'd say adding tofu might not be a bad idea when you order it).  An almost perpetual Yelp check-in bonus affords you a free basket o' chips which you can dunk into an assortment of about 6 or 7 salsas ranging from \"Are there even tomatoes in this water dip?\" to *flat-line sounds*. I don't like the hot stuff - the mild suits me just fine. They'll charge you for a large container for salsa but you can take your fill of the tiny ones. A bit wasteful but whatevs I'll just take my 6 little cups of free salsa and roll. Chips aside, you can't complain about the tacos either. The arepas, in my opinion, lack a bit of flavor with their dough to contents ratio.  The downsides include the price and the quality of service. The prices are a bit high but I would say they're on par with similar such restaurants. And considering the quality of food here I don't complain. They're always jam-packed and the staff is constantly on the move. Is that an excuse for nasty attitudes? I don't think so but you'll still catch it sometimes ranging from the people that take your order down to the people calling your name or cleaning tables. I've met the most bipolar mix of folks in just this one restaurant. One person looking like they'd rather not be paid to take your order (just paid) and another doing so with the most unexpected smile ever. Nonetheless, Sabor will keep rocking it and I'll keep visiting here for that binge fix.",

We stood in line for longer than I wanted considering there were only 3 parties ahead of us, but the staff was really nice.  I got two tacos auntenticos (one al pastor pork and one grilled chicken) with a side of chips and guac and a water for less than $10. Score! The al pastor was definitely the better of the two, but both taco shells were a little chewy. Eh. The chips and guac were good, and I really loved the salsa bar - how fun!  My coworker got the quinoa avocado bowl, which she said was good, but something in the air made her eyes water the entire time we were there! Maybe we were too close to the spicy salsa bar?

Don't forget to get your free order of chips when you check in! The portion is big enough for two people to share. Did I mention the free salsa bar?   Lastly, the prices are fantastic.

    "text": "My favorite Latin food in Charlotte. What can I say that others have not yet addressed? The Elote - roasted corn with some queso and a hint of mayo and chili powder - is comfort food to me, and so are are their tacos authenticos.  What Sabor does better than anyone? Salsa. Their fresh salsa bar has 6-9 types of freshly made salsa from mild to pretty darned hot, and as someone else has said, the pineapple habenero salsa is suuuuuuuuuuuuper good. I would definitely try the queso, too. Probably the best I have had in the city.  The only thing on the menu that I didn't love was the empanada, which I think was a touch greasy for me, but the texture was exquisite.    Seriously, try this place.",

The tacos are served authentic with onion and cilantro on them and are around the size of a tapa. My husband and I usually get 6 tacos with a side of chips/queso/salsa and we destroy it- always leaving full. My favorite part of Sabor is the salsa bar. I'm in love with the Jalapeno salsa and the spicy pineapple. They also have a red cream sauce that is awesome on the beef tacos! Feel free to try all of them!",

    "text": "Boyfriend asked what I wanted for dinner. Opened Yelp app and tacos was already typed into the search bar so we went with that. Answer is almost always tacos, why does he even ask? To be polite I guess.   You know a place is good when the line is out the door on a Sunday evening. The whole menu looked amazing, but my man friend and I  decided on carne asada fries, elote loco (corn on the cob smothered with deliciousness), a taco each, and chips with every salsa from the salsa bar-- no shame. All of that came to just $18 since the chips were free with a Yelp check-in-- and it was a lot of food.   Wait for the food was a little bit due to the crowd. Only complaint is I wished they would have given us the chips when we placed our order not with the rest of the food so they were more of an appetizer. I bet if I asked next time they would.   Thought the carne asada fries were going to be one of those novelty items you order once just to try. Nope. I will have them every other time. Fries topped with steak, cheese, guacamole and sour cream-- too good to pass up.   I've never had street corn like that before, but have seen many a picture on on Instagram and it did not disappoint. Tacos were great too, and pretty large!   Was pretty uncomfortably full when I left, but so worth it. Nothing fancy about this place at all, which is A-OK with me. I wasn't aware they had so many locations! Goal next visit is to see how I can incorporate more guacamole into my order.",

    "text": "I love love love Sabors. My go to any time I'm craving Mexican food. So let's start from the top..    PARKING- It Sucks! The parking lot is wayyy to small and usually packed,  especially during the week. I have noticed on the weekends in the late afternoon (2-5pm)  it much less crowded. Even so, at any time if there's no parking it's worth the wait until found.   SERVICE: It's a no frills eat-in place. You order at the counter and you can either have it ToGo or sit at the few tables they have avaible. The food comes up and they call your name you pick it up from the counter.  It's usually pretty fast service, I can never complain and I have absolutely no patience. But while you wait make sure you visit the salsa bar...  FOOD: So. Damn. Delicious!!!!!!!  So I mentioned the salsa bar... It's not an option to skip over it. Check in on yelp and get your free chips . GET THE QUESO!!!!  It's the best queso ever..  Not up for debate. So far I've had the street corn, empanada (chicken, beef, and chorizo), the Carne Asada fries,  tacos ($1 on Tuesdays), and the grilled chicken Sabor Especial burrito. All amazing and leave me wanting more after I'm done.   GO TO SABOR!!!!",

Kudos to Mel. I asked her if she was the owner. She laughed and said no. Said she just loves the job and the people. She knows the menu and ingredients inside out. Makes recommendations. She remembered me from first trip in. GREAT PEOPLE PERSON. Very rare to find someone like her any more. SABOR IS WORTH THE TRIP.",

Definitely do not dress up even though it is a surprisingly good place to people-watch.  The chicken tacos were my favorite.  I wasn't crazy about the steak in their burrito.  But the tortilla chips were great and they have a salsa bar in the back with several flavors and spice levels that is fun to experiment with.    Staff was helpful and explained items on the menu.  They definitely serve margaritas with real tequila even though their listing says only beer and wine.  And bathrooms are clean which is one of my pet-peeves.  So all in all I would come back for more of those chicken tacos and salsa.",

When I say onions, I'm not talking about a few, either--half of my last two burritos were literally made of only raw onions. Raw. As in, uncooked, unseasoned, just raw. Not even marinated like in a good pico de gallo. Raw.  When I brought it up, they argued with me and treated me like I was stupid because how could I not know that the shrimp came with raw onions, even when you say no onions at all? That's when I decided I don't need this in my life.   Too bad, because it used to be great.",

The burrito was pretty bland as well, the chips were good. I will also note that on both trips here the toilet has been broken & the bathroom was not the cleanest. My stomach was not too happy on either occasion either, I'll leave it at that. I really like Three Amigos, I was expecting a lot more from this establishment. I don't believe I will be making a third trip. If I get a hankering for a burrito I'll drive a little further to Chipotle.",

We also tried a gordita, a pupusa and an arepa and while the pupusa and the arepa were really quite good, the gordita was nothing more than a pile of shredded cheese and some chicken inside.

However, I have really been wanting to try this place, so I also ordered a chicken arepa and a side of guac. Both were just average. Arepa probably would have been better if it had more time to cool (I burned my hands trying to eat it) and if I hadn't already scarfed down an empanada. Overall, I ate enough for two people and had a soft drink for about $12. Not bad. I will be back to try carne asada fries and margaritas.",

If one of them is no good, the other better crazy good.  Unfortunately for this place, the service sucks.  I know we all have our bad days and maybe the chef who also took our order was having a bad day but this is what I have to go on.  He just looked pissed.  In a bad mood, giving one word answers and not friendly at all.  He also spoke with such a low voice it made it difficult to understand him.  Because of this we hoped the food would just blow us away.  It didnt.  It wasnt bad but it was just ok.  I wouldnt say \"wow you have to try this place\".  its just ehhhh, ok.",

    "text": "Sabor Amargo (Bittersweet) - Just left Sabor about 30 minutes ago and I'm still hungry and even more disappointed. Where do I start? Let's start with the good - friendly cashier, good tasting food. The bad? Everything else. The place was a complete disaster. It was dirty, the women's bathroom was broken and the men's restroom didn't have a working sink. Only the hot water knob was functional thus hot scolding water was the only option if you were brave enough to wash your hands (don't worry I did). I waited patiently for about 20 minutes and then grew rather impatient after 40. Finally when my order was delivered it was incomplete. I saw other customers having similar issues so I didn't panic. I asked for my order to be corrected and it wasn't. The cashier was a little too friendly and was too busy talking up customers to address my issue with urgency it required. I asked for a refund for the missing items from my order and unfortunately the cashier was unable to help me. She solicited the help of a cook who didn't speak really good English. She asked me how much I paid for my taco...I pointed to the menu and she attempted to swipe my card at least 4 times without success. Finally, I asked for my card back and just told her to forget it. All this time there is a manager type in the back room on his laptop being rather useless. I'm hopeful this person is a vendor and not an owner or manager. He never came to help quell the traffic or help out his overburdened staff. Overwhelming disappointed in that a few basic restaurant rules weren't followed - advise customers that the kitchen is backed up, offer a replacement for a missing item, how to manage a POS system, delivering \"fast food\" in under 40 minutes. I hope this place gets it together, too many good restaurants in Charlotte who can fill this void.",

Sabor is not really a dinner-before-a-show kinda place, but at the same time, why shouldn't it be? You order up at the counter, pick a beer from the cooler and get your sauces from the salsa bar area. The place was buzzing with people on a Wednesday night.   We ordered the chips, a build-your-own-bowl as well as a quinoa rice + avocado bowl (add Tilapia)... Everything was fresh and good. Chips were outstanding! :) Sabor is a unique little place that has somehow created a slightly different non-chainy twist on Latin food. Yum. This place is right around the corner from me so I imagine that it will become a regular pit stop.   Oh - check-in on Yelp BEFORE you eat there. I did so as I was leaving and saw the \"free chips\" offer. Oh well, next time!",

I have never had something on the menu I didn't like. The nachos are piled high on a plate the size of a trashcan lid and something you can definitely share with a group of people. Make sure to check in on yelp for a side of free chips as they don't come with the smallest size of dips. If you're just feeling salsa they have a plethora of options on their salsa bar. Taking your order to go? No problem, they have small cups with lids so you can stash a few in your bag to try with your meal at home. Overall a great spot with a casual atmosphere and friendly staff.",

(I've seen this in California served from street carts but never have tried it - LOVE LOVE LOVE me some fatty corn!)  Tacos Authenticos: Corn tortillas with your choice of shredded chicken or steak and topped with onions, cilantro and a lemon wedge. (Be sure to order multiples!)  Sabor Special: Burrito with your choice of meat and filled with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, lettuce and cheese sauce. (I got the steak with black beans, these burritos are huge and pretty darn delicious especially if you add some pico de gayo from the salsa bar!)  El Dominicano: Flat grilled burrito filled with a mixture of chicken, cabbage, onions and tomatoes, all grilled to perfection and topped with our homemade pink sauce.  I'm looking forward to going back and checking out some of their specials!",

Every order is cooked fresh and it is more authentic than any other fast food burrito place.  The margarita was mix free so it didn't contain the syrupy sweetness that mix margaritas have.    The salsa bar had 6 homemade salsas on it ranging from different degrees of spiciness.    Only downside was the overuse of pepper.  It tended to overpower the food at times.    Still if you are looking for authentic mexican street food with a higher quality than the chains, this is the place to go.",

My family and I enjoy Mexican Fridays where it's our thing to go out to Mexican dinner every Friday to celebrate the end of the week.  This would be a great option except it's more of an in and out diner/lunch spot as opposed to sitting down and enjoying a dinner.     Again great option for lunch or quick dinner, but not the type of place to sit down for a meal and thoroughly enjoy.    P.S. Get the empanada!",

The decor is cool, funky, and Latin - not at all the typical Mexican-american restaurant. They use an open kitchen design where you can see and smell all the goodness. And certainly it is important to note the attentive, friendly staff. I admitted to being a newbie with my yelp open and in hand, and they were excited to bring on a new follower.  Okay, now for the food. Ordered 2 tacos, 1 chicken 1 fish, both authentic. Outstanding, fresh, nothing else needed to say. Also ordered a large guacamole and cashed in on the free chips with the Yelp check in. The guac was clearly fresh and homemade. Top notch. The interesting thing about the chips was that they were tossed in a paprika seasoning. Top notch as well.  Go here now. You will not be disappointed.",

Taco tuesdays ($1) are all that I have expereinced thus far however they get me through the day. I prefer the chicken tacos however I noticed my taco shells get moist after awhile. It's cool becuase it only confirms they're fresh. Speaking of Tuesday I think I just figured out what's for lunch !!!",

    "text": "Food was nice but the cleanliness of the restaurant was lacking and is driving this low rating. I saw other Yelpers had similar experiences. The tables and floor had remnants of food from previous customers which was pretty gross. I actually slid across the floor on beans. The service counter where you pick up your food was covered in taco meat and shredded lettuce too. They didn't have individual napkins, but rather, a big spool of brown paper that was placed by the salsa bar for everyone to access. We ordered nachos and street corn which was plenty to share for 2. We liked the food okay but have deemed this a take-out only spot for future. For now we'll stick to Three Amigos.",

    "text": "Ok... So if you had asked me what Dominican Street Food was a few months ago I would have stated confusingly back at you.  Well no more my friends!!!  This place is in a neighborhood adjacent to ours in Charlotte and has become our favorite place to ride our bikes to and enjoy.  Now remember this is billed as street food, so do not expect fancy... Just expect good.  From the tacos to the empanadas to our favorite Yucca Nelie, it's all extremely tasty and just plain fun.  The service is good, they have limited outside seating, a killer homemade salsa bar, awesome margaritas, and a big cooler of craft beers.  How can you go wrong?  If you haven't been yet and live in Charlotte you should get moving now!  Take care and eat up y'all!",
