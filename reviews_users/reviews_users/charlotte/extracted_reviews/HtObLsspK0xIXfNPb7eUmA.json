The girl on the phone told me there was no need so after work, around 7:30, we walked in a requested a spot for 2. She tried to sit me at a table in the dining room and seemed peeved when I told her we wanted the hibachi grill. We waited at the bar where we enjoyed FANTASTIC service and a delicious appetizer! After about 30-45 minutes a asked if there was going to be a hibachi grill open for us and the hostess again pushed us towards sitting at a regular table which we eventually did. Our bartender was our server and she was GREAT! Our food was delicious and I did enjoy the atmosphere, I just wish that they would have let me know when I called that there may not be a hibachi grill open late on a Monday evening.",

The food is decent but the customer service definitely lacks when you're dining in here. I'm not too keen of their sushi served here either. For a while, when i would eat here i would order a roll just to see if it would be any good or if anything has changed in quality. I regret it everytime because it definitely doesnt taste fresh. Eventually, I gave up on the sushi thing with them. I guess this is a good establishment for families who want to entertain their little kids with the hibachi grill and what not. Other than that it's nothing to brag about here.",

I've been several times and I have always enjoyed the hibachi show (though there wasn't anything to stand out from other locations). The food is neither excellent nor poor.  I have branched out to trying different hibachi locations despite the convenience of Fuji to my apartment because last time I was there the waitress refused to accept a $10 off coupon I was given on my last visit stating that it had expired. I thought the date was pretty clear, and she barely looked at it before refusing. I even took out my antiquated physical planner to show her that my last visit was not long ago and well after the date she claimed my coupon expired. She had quite an attitude so we let it slide and paid full price but will most likely not return.   I would say this place is good if you are looking for standard hibachi, but it does not sit well with me when an establishment doesn't honor their own coupons.",

Several minutes later she returns to the table and informs us that lunch ended at 2:30, gave us our menus back, and left so that we may order from the dinner menu.  When she came back, a member of our party let her know that we were seated before 2:30 and ordered our drinks as well. Our food order was only taken at around 2:35. The waitress left to speak with someone only to come back and tell us they would not be able to honor the lunch menu specials. We simply asked for our check for our drinks (all fountain drinks), paid, and left.  All in all, it was a really crappy experience. Fuji had been one of my families favorite restaurants for close to 8 years. While the food has never disappointed, the service in retrospect has steadily gone downhill. I don't believe we would ever go back, especially given that so many other Japanese/Sushi restaurants with more reasonable pricing have cropped up in the area.",

My first time here, but when with a group that enjoys going here it seems.  We had an entertaining hibachi chef who did a great job keeping up smiling.  This is located in a newer build shopping center, and has nice fountains and sidewalks around as you walk in.  We went in the rain, and there are even some awnings so you can arrive only mildly wet.  Will definately be back to try the sushi, which looks great from everyone's Yelp photos.  More to come for this review.",

What I like about it is that if you go by 7 pm on any night of the week, there isn't normally a wait like other older hibachi places in town.  It is busy just less crowded. They do take reservations, have a sushi bar and a regular dining room. The food has always been good, right on par with my expectations. Service has been good as well. I have always gotten some form of hibachi even when I sat in the regular dining room. It has always been good! Drinks--better when sitting at the bar---they seem to pour differently then when ordering at the grills. I like a balanced cocktail, so I am not suggesting they are are too strong or too weak, just different.  I have even ordered takeout recently. Have to say that for to-go hibachi, it was packed well and included everything normally served dining in. I ordered there and it took about 10 minutes for my food. It was piping hot when I got home too.  I would say this is one of the better places to eat in the Rivergate area.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to take a chance on Fuji despite mixed reviews. So, we didn't exactly go in with high expectations. Also regarding out review, we decided to be seated at a table versus doing Hibachi, so your experience may vary.  We were seated quickly to a semi-full dining room. It took another ~10 minutes before our waiter came by to ask if someone had already had come by to take our drink order. All said and done, we had been seated for about ~20 minutes before we had our drinks and put in our order.   Trying to get a cross section of what Fuji offers, we ordered some Edemame for the appetizer, we both ordered an Udon entree, my wife getting the Tempura Udon (soup) and me getting the Udon stir fried with beef. We then also each ordered a sushi roll to try what they had from their sushi bar.  The appetizer came out quickly, as did our main courses. The food was hot and seemed freshly made. That being said, both our main courses were pretty bland. The broth for my wife's Udon soup had very little flavor.   30 minutes after our main course had come out, our sushi rolls had still not come to the table. We had to find our waitress to see where our rolls were. She brought them to the table quickly after we asked, which makes me thing they were sitting on the counter for a while. They were both OK.  That being said, Fuji Japanese Steakhouse earned the two stars from us. As far as a seated dinner goes, we probably won't be back.",

When we told our waitress she acted as if she didn't understand what I wanted or expected so sent a manager over. Told her our food was cold she ask \"do you want some more chicken?\"  Basically just replaced the items that were cold and not the whole meal. When it finally came out I asked if I could get my rice replaced which was now also cold. Well that really confused her.  I just told her never mind and so she left and actually no one came back to check on us knowing they had a table with bad service.  Eventually I just packed up  my cold food to take home and after some discussion they did comp my meal.  Very very poor customer service!  I may go back but not to eat in the dining room again.",

The place is modern with hibachi grill tables, a sushi bar, or you can sit at a regular old table and get some great Japanese food.  Lunch prices as mentioned before are very cheap, even for the teppanyaki experience.  The sushi is great and they make it quickly - even to go, so it's better and fresher than the stuff at Harris Teeter in the case.",

I think the hibachi entrees are way overpriced, considering the amount of actual protein you got in the end...with 7 adults at a grill (being cornily entertained), who all got hibachi combos of steak, scallops, shrimp or chicken, in the end, not much food.  So, for $18-22 a person, about a cup of veggies at most, a cup of cubed meat, and then 2 cups' worth of fried rice and a cup of wonton noodles. Rip off ultimately.  Also, ordering any non-alcoholic drinks is a glass rammed full of ice cubes, so a refill is only about 3/4-cup of actual liquid.  It was ok in the end, I guess I'd return, but if I never did, nothing lost.",

They gave us a bowl of rice, a plate of noodles, oh so good miso soup and salad with a choice of house (ginger-yummy) or ranch dressing. The couple next to us seemed to enjoy there food just as much as we did and I heard no complaints or looks of discontent on anyone's face.   We also got a order of the yellow tail sushi - compliments to the sushi chef! Sure wish I had room to try more.  Hands down, I would choose this as the place to go if you are looking to not be disappointed. The menu has a large selection of choices.   Tokyo was our first choice when we thought sushi, but we were looking for a front seat to the grill master and some entertainment. The sushi bar was really nice a clean looking.  The whole restaurant had a nice atmosphere about it. I wish I could relocate this place to my home town.    I gave this a 5 star since there were no 4 1/2 stars. Hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!!!",

This is by far THE worst place I have been for sushi and service. I was disappointed in the food and our server. Took forever to receive our sushi. But what made the night worse was when I showed them my groupon through my app off my phone they refused to take it saying they needed a printed copy to put in the computer. I, being a server myself, and also having to have dealt with groupons couldn't understand why she wouldn't accept my groupon. So we had an argument for 5 minutes. Than my boyfriend asked for a manager and we were told no one was in other than the cashier. GREAT! The cashier calls the manager and comes back to tell me the most she can do is take 20 percent off my tab. Tab was 59.43 and through groupon I had paid 15 for 30 so I was infuriated to say the least. Even showing the damn groupon receipt and what it in tells that I am entitled to she still denied my 30 dollars off. So we told her we will not pay for anything on the tab because now we're being ripped off. Needless to say after 30 minutes of arguing and being chased down they finally took my groupon and we were able to pay. I will NEVER come back here again nor recommend anyone, especially w groupon.",

We never got our sushi dishes and at the end of our meal we figure they would not charge us, but we got charged for our sushi. We told the waiter that we did not get our sushi and was not going to pay for it; that's when they brought our sushi plate to us. My friends did not want to throw a scene so we took it to go and they offer us $10 off our next meal, however we need to go back in like two weeks to use that $10 off coupon. We also didn't get a lot of refills or condiments that we requested for. Overall the hibachi dish was okay, the fried rice was good compare to other steakhouse places. However the sushi was not good at all for the price you had to pay and service sucks if you are in the dining area that is.",

I made a reservation two weeks in advance for my brothers graduation for 7 people. However, they sat half of our family behind the chef to where they couldn't see any of the cooking. They claimed they have to \"fill up 8 seats\" so they filled the others with a random couple pushing our family behind the grill EXCEEDING the table limit. The workers were inconsiderate, rude, and condescending. If you want a pleasant experience, DO NOT COME HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.",

By the time our party got seated into the party, we were told they couldn't fulfill our request for the chef today because they were busy.  We did gave another chef a try, the food was mediocre, it was salty and oily. If they tell us beforehand that our request cannot be fulfill, we wouldn't have our party here.",

Unfortunately, all the memories came back of the reason i dont go there regularly.    I ordered the hibachi chicken.  It was $16 for a to-go dinner.  It came with a salad, soup, chicken, noodles, rice, and veggies.  I guess I paid for the quantity and not the quality.  The salad was just iceberg thrown in a container.  The soup was ok.  The rice was not what I ordered, I got fried instead of white, so my comments on that are skewed  pretty negatively.  The chicken was dry and had not been seasoned at all, so even with the sauces given it was hard to eat the whole thing.    So im not sure if the experience is better at the hibachi table itself, but the take out is not nearly worth the price.  Very disappointing.",

We waited around for nothing while our food was getting cold in the bag.   I ordered the chicken and shrimp. Which was all over cooked.  The chicken had no flavor and was extremely chewy.  The shrimp was tough. However, the vegetables felt under cooked because they were still hard.  My salad was sitting in box filled with water,  so the lettuce became soggy.

She then proceeds to argue with me, insisting there was no take out order called in and that was probably their sister location.  She wanted me to provide the number I called which in fact was their sister location (my bad!) but then she says to me, in a very rude manner, you need to call them back now and cancel the order as that is a lot of food they are wasting.  I would have accepted this fine with no issues but the way in which she addressed me and spoke to me was totally uncalled for, unprofessional and downright rude.  She then says to me, well what do you want to order...at this point I told her I do not plan on placing an order, I will take my business elsewhere and that she was unprofessional and rude.  She responds by vehemently denying she was rude.  I chose not to further engage with her and decided to take this matter up with management so I exited and the restaurant and intend upon calling her Manager/general manager in the morning to apprise him of the situation.  There was no cause of action for how rude this individual was and therefore there is never a need to address a customer in that manner.",

    "text": "First visit:  I came on a Tuesday evening to enjoy wine and sushi with a friend. We decided to pass on the hibachi experience. I ordered the Sushi Appetizer (Assorted fish over rice) along with a side of spicy mayo. My friend ordered the Caterpillar Roll, which tasted amazing!!! This place is small, the tables and floors are clean. After leaving I noticed the Yelp Checkin offer. Which I planned to redeem later....  Second visit: Monday evening, I noticed ton of people waiting on tables and ToGo orders. I came solo. The hostess seated me at the sushi bar. The evening was quite busy. After overlooking the menu, I couldn't wait to enjoy a few sushi rolls. 15 MINUTES went by!! No one took my order!! I Became frustrated and left.   Will I return again?? Maybe in a few months. Hoping for a better experience the third time around",

Then we were seated but nobody even came to our table for over 10 minutes, the waitress walked by us but never even got our drink order. The food has always been OK at best, nothing to brag about and the service has always been horrible. No more Fuji for me",

My family decided to order take out dinner from here with our small child, but according to the manager, the policy from the owner is that you cannot Place a kids order to go. We were told that instead of a to go kids order we would have to order every part of the kids meal a la carte which of course would eventually end up being the cost if not more than an adult meal. When asked to explain further and clarify how that made any sense for a family with little kids that did not want to sit in the restaurant, and whose kids would not eat a full adult portion, all the manager could say was \"that's a policy from the owner\". Needless to say, we cancelled our entire order which would have been close to $100 because of this. They would rather lose business than to allow a family with small kids to order their kids meal to go.",

The vegetables and fried rice tasted stale and several patrons at our table mentioned it to our hibachi chef. He then proceeded to tell all of the diners at his table how the management doesn't care about quality and that the rice had been sitting out all day and that's why it tastes so bad. He was clearly hating his job and didn't mind telling all of us about it. It was an AWFUL experience and we'll never return.",

I've never had a sake shot at the grill but it was really entertaining for everyone involved. He was a blast and a good cook.   Overall the service was good. Our waters were kept full and additional drinks were brought quickly. The gentleman bussing tables was really quick and super respectful as he hurried around.

    "text": "I moved over to this side of town recently and was looking for a lunch spot that the whole family can enjoy.  Fuji seems to fit the bill since it's got the Hibachi & Sushi thing going on.  In the end, we left with our bellies full, my wallet was $54.00 lighter and it was a forgettable meal.  I will say the service was good & friendly.  My little one is in the \"I only eat chicken nuggets\" stage.  Fuji didn't have \"nuggets\" per se, but their tempura chicken was close enough.  No Ketchup, Duck Sauce or french fries.  Just plain, flavorless chicken tempura.  The waitress brought out some shrimp sauce which I'll get to in a minute and some sweet sauce which was OK.  Little one satisfied.  I ordered the hibachi steak lunch.  Over $10.00 which included steak, noodles, veggies.  The steak was unseasoned.  For God's sake Fuji, you can't just take foodservice steak, cut it in bits and grill on a flat top.  It's not like it's a great cut of steak....YOU HAVE TO SEASON it with something!  I see this more and more when dining out and it ticks me off.  OK, we've established the steak wasn't seasoned.  Usually then you turn to the last bastion of Japanese Dining....the Shrimp Sauce.  Back in my day I could drink shrimp sauce it was like the next best thing to, well.....you know.  This shrimp sauce was like pink water.  No flavor.  Whatsoever.  So I had flavorless steak, veggies, and noodles on a plate and pink water for sauce.    My older daughter had a Rainbow Roll which was OK.  Nothing special.  Sweetie had the 3 roll lunch and it was, again, flavorless.    4 people and over $50.00 for lunch is about the norm these days.  I'm ine with spending the money, but would like to be able to write at least 4 stars.  The 3 I gave is generous.",

The service was terrible and slow and our waitress seems like she didn't want to serve us (tall Caucasian girl). We got our waters first thing, and 15 minutes later we finally got to order. 45 minutes later we got our entrees. We didn't sit at the hibachi tables, we sat in the dining room thinking that it would be faster. The picture attached is our $25 filet and shrimp entree, which looks like something you can get for $7.99 at a hibachi place. Looks like we paid the same price as the people sitting at the grill, we just didn't get a show to go with it. Aside from that, there was water dripping from the ceiling onto our table and into my water cup and my sisters food. She stopped eating her food because we didn't don't know where that ceiling water came from. I told one of the waitress about it after waiting forever just to get her attention (my gf had to walk to the front to get her while she was standing around). One waitress said they would let the manager know about it and get back to us, no one came to even apologize about it. So we decided to just get our check and leave the contaminated food behind. When we got home my sister threw up, and my daughter threw up. These people didn't seem to care too much about their customers so there isn't much to try to confront them further about it. I just know that we will never come back there ever, and anyone that I know will know not to come there as well. Our exciting Saturday night out with the family turned into disappointment and illnesses.",

    "text": "This is an update to my previous review. I've been to Fuji several times since posting my original review and each time, I noticed a significant reduction in the quality of their service and food.   On our most recent visit, we waited 50 minutes for our chef to arrive. There were only two chefs serving the whole hibachi area. Lame.   As for the food, the fried rice (which used to be a high point) is now nothing more than rice, with some egg and teriyaki sauce mixed in. The proteins were very poor as well - five people in our party got the chicken hibachi and the chicken on every plate was inedible. It was clearly low-grade chicken that resembled the texture of a chewy piece of rubber.   Within two hours of the meal, six of the seven people in our party experienced serious stomach discomfort - I'm sure you know what I'm referring to here.   Fuji used to be one of our regular dinner spots. Sadly,the quality and service issues will prevent us from returning.",

The appetizers here are very affordable to begin with. Everything on the appetizer menu was anywhere from 4 to 6 dollars. So after browsing the menu i decided on the coconut shrimp and i ordered a fiji cosmo because i was feeling real sex in the city vibes on this day. Never have i had a cosmo quite that strong. They were not stingy with the alcohol at all, so that's good for some to know im sure. Coconut shrimp were shockingly good i decided since everything on the menu was so affordable and i had 50% off why the heck not order another appetizer so in addition to the shrimp i ordered the fried rolls. They have won me over for a spot to come and grab appetizers.",

One time during a hibachi experience , our chef was bragging to a group of teenager at our table that he \"cooks edible brownies\". Unprofessional.

Tonight my daughter went to celebrate her birthday and was very rushed and told to go to the sushi bar to have cake.  There were eight of them but only two seats.  She and her friends had to have cake outside because they wanted to seat new customers rather than take care of existing ones.   The bill was gratuitized and each person had an entree of at least $21.   Cant you give someone a few minutes to celebrate .   Especially since I am a regular customer that has been coming for years?  I don't want any special treatment , just what a normal customer should expect.  Should expect are  the key words.  Apparently not.  In the scope of things it prob doesn't matter that I go there at least once a month but poor service adds up.  I'm done with this place",

For appetizer, my girlfriend and I had the Beef Asparagus, which was asparagus wrapped in thin beef slices. It tasted good, but I had one piece that was not cooked all around.  For entree, I had an Udon (first one on the Udon list, but I forgot the name) and it was only so-so. It is topped with cabbage, broccoli, shiitake mushroom, chicken, sunny side up egg, imitation crab and tempura shrimp. The combination is a bit random if you asked me.The salad that came with the Udon was soggy and a bit frozen, but the ginger sauce taste delicious. My girlfriend had the Amazing Rolls and gave them warm praises - she said they were a step or two above grocery store sushi. All in all, dining in at Fuji did not evoke any excitement from me.",

You can get white or fried rice (no brown:(  They serve you Salad and Miso soup beforehand. The Ginger Salad Dressing is really good! They have a good choice of meats, seafoods & veggies as well as Tofu to choose from for your entree, so veggie people are good to go too If you decide on Hibachi, the variety is even greater.

    "text": "Visited Fuji last night with my in-laws, including my sister-in-law who was in town with my young niece and nephew. I have actually been a waitress at this type of hibachi steakhouse before, back in college, so I knew exactly what to expect, and Fuji definitely met my expectations.  We all did the hibachi grill menu for the show, which finally got the kids' attention away from their Leapfrog and iTouch and onto the chef. They were mesmerized by all the elements of the cooking. I made it a point to ask for the \"kids chopsticks\" which are a chopstick set that's got rubber bands and a \"fulcrum\" made from the chopstick wrapping paper so that kids can use it to eat their food without having to have as much dexterity as an adult. The only thing I could suggest is that maybe these could be offered to any table with youngsters eating without someone having to ask? I only knew these existed because I had made them many times in my job, and everyone at the table was surprised and happy when the kids got their own set of usable chopsticks. We made a big deal out of them using their \"chopsticks\" and in doing so actually got the picky eaters to eat more than they might have otherwise.  The menu is the usual basic hibachi experience: miso soup, salad with ginger dressing (ranch is also available), a shrimp \"appetizer\", vegetables, rice and meat. This restaurant also had noodles that they cooked which were delicious. I've never really been a fan of noodles in Asian cuisine (or anywhere in general) but I ate all of mine quickly.  The service was quick, the food was good, the \"show\" was good, and we had a great time. I should note that Sunday night at 6:30 is a great time to bring kids as the two in our party were able to make a little bit of their usual noise, but were drowned out by the sounds of the fan, and there was at least one child of their age or younger at each of the other tables, so I wasn't terribly worried about noise or inconveniencing other patrons.  Fuji didn't stand out particularly for any one thing, but they delivered a solid meal for all of us quickly. We'll be back!",

    "text": "(Excuse the missing punctuation over the \"e\" in \"sake\"; so that word is indeed \"sah-key\".  I'm not computer proficient enough to do that yet!  LOL.)  Let me start by saying we will go back as long as we ALWAYS get the guy who cooked for us the last time!  I'm STILL singing the \"Sake, sake, sake; go, go, go!!!\" song in my head!  Went on Sunday for my kids' FIRST experience with hibachi.  They all had a blast.  At first, when the chef started the flame up on the burner, my 9-year-old HF autistic son was a little nervous and my 5-year-old nearly crawled under the table.  By the end, however, the 5-year-old sounded like Beavis...\"FIRE, FIRE, FIRE!!!\"  The food was great!  Wasn't too wild about the salad, but it was the standard hibachi side I guess.  When the chef played the \"sake\" game with my husband, it was hysterical!    He cooked everything to perfection.  My 16-year-old, who sticks her nose up at EVERYTHING, ate the steak quicker than she has ever eaten anything.  The kids ALL managed to catch the broccoli; the younger ones thought that was quite the accomplishment!  And when our chef had finished at our table and was cooking for the table next to us, he actually checked on our son to make sure he knew the fire was about to start up at the next table and not to be frightened.  By that time our son was all smiles!  I still appreciate his attention to that detail!  We're DEFINITELY going back.  I'm very hard-pressed to find a restaurant with that sort of attention to the little patrons as well as the big patrons.  No crayons and coloring menu needed here!  All you need is the guy who can spin a mean spatula and who has a mustard bottle full of sake!",

    "text": "I would only suggest eating hibachi there. I've never had a problem with the hibachi. How ever the sushi can be a bit over priced for the quality and taste. I went in on a Wednesday night before the dinner rush and for some reason our server did not bring our sushi out in time. I stared at our plates sitting in the window for at least 30 mins. (We were sitting in front of the sushi bar) After telling my sister that was our order she insisted that it wasn't, considering the fact that out server hasn't  touched it or anything like that. Before you know she brings the exact same plates I've been staring at for the longest to our table. By this point I'm utterly upset because not only she took a long time to bring the sushi she somehow dropped one next to my foot. If I had known that was going to happened I would have gotten up myself and brought it to our table. The other thing that was but annoying was the fact that my cousin ordered a simple side salad to go with her meal nothing to crazy.. She never got it. But our server gave me a salad because she dropped my sushi. Not the best experience I've had there. I don't think I will ever go back for their sushi. But I would for their hibachi possible Togo next time. I wouldn't dine in at all.  We came in at 5:10 and did not leave till 7:15.",

Their spicy tuna is actually spicy and never fishy tasting. Masago is my addiction and it never taste like it's been sitting around for weeks. I love Fuji because they don't deep fry or cover their sushi in goopy sauces to try and cover up low quality food. They use the best and that's why it's so good. And their lunch specials are a steal!!",

There have been times when service is a bit slow, but it does not warrant me giving them anything short of 5 stars. I wish they were more liberal with their $5 and $10 off coupons like they have been in the past. My wife and I alwasy get the Kani Tempura and Philly Rolls which have never once been disappointing. They also have a jalepeno roll of some sort that's ridiculously good as well with minimal heat. I would DEFINITELY recommend a sushi dinner and hibachi lunch. And yes, their ginger and coconut sauces are outstanding!",

I can agree with the other reviewers, that the service was lackluster and rushed. Also, the prices did not match the quality of the food. We have NO problem paying for any good vittles. Food was just not seasoned at all. At least sprinkle some salt on the chicken and beef.  They also put egg in the rice a a la Chinese joints. We've never had that at the Hibachi dinners we've frequented. *shrugs* Only wish we could have ordered the kids meal for less of a dent in our pockets. The chef's act also seemed abnormally forced. I get it-must be pretty mundane to feign excitement for the same fire tricks. Just an all-around strange experience. We would have fared better getting some chicken tenders at Hubee D's and could have saved 40 bucks!  Better luck and NOT a next time here.",

    "text": "It's hard to enjoy your hibachi meal when more then half the people seated at your table are complaining. I don't think it's wise to come to a hibachi restaurant and expect express service. If you're looking for quick I'd suggest one of those hibachi express places in the outlets or off yorkmount road. The grill was not preheated when we arrived so after waiting for the table to fill up and waiting for the grill to get hot it probably was about 30min before the chef started to cook. The guy was a bit clumsy and one of his spatulas actually hit a lady sitting at the table (trick gone bad). After that he was trying to do his routine but the other customers at the table were less then nice and requested he not do anymore tricks and just cook the food. Besides a crapppy atmosphere due to the people seated at the table with me, the food was good. I ordered chicken and shrimp hibachi and I also got a California roll. My sister ordered coconut shrimp (4 pieces) was a bit over $6 while I think a bit overpriced they were good. I would return but maybe at a busier time when they are more prepared?",

    "text": "We visited Fuji at 3:30pm on a rainy Sunday.  It wasn't full, so we had amazing service  :-)  The place looks nice, smells fine, and is welcoming.  There's a big menu both with sushi and hibachi selections printed in an unusual pattern on the menu.  It makes hunting for a selection a little disorienting, but we quickly found our rhythm.    This being our first visit, I wanted to try a Bento box so I could get a small sampling of various items.  I was told that the Bento boxes were only offered at lunch and that lunch ends at 2:30pm (though that's not written on the menu anywhere).  I asked if I could pay a higher price and still get the Bento box and was a little irritated when they refused that option as well.  So in my attempt to still get some variety I ordered edamame, California rolls, and a ginger salad with a sweet tea.  My fella ordered the teriyaki chicken which came with miso soup and a sweet tea.  My edamame was super salty and undercooked for my liking.  My salad was tasty, but then again I love ginger so it's hard to mess up a bowl of lettuce with ginger dressing poured over it.  My California rolls arrived:  they were very thin, heavily rolled in roe and there were only 6 pieces.?.  They offered a tiny pile of white ginger and a small pile of cakey green wasabi.  I made due, but I wish I'd have known about the roe as I do not enjoy it and would've requested that they leave it off.  My sweet tea was great and they kept my glass full  :-)  My fella's teriyaki chicken arrived on a  loudly sizzling platter... a la mexican fajitas??  which we found odd.  It was a huge mass of onions with a char-grilled chicken breast cut in strips layered across the onions with 3 pieces of broccoli, 2 baby carrots and syrupy sweet teriyaki poured all over the top...  It wasn't nearly as tasty as it sounds.  My fella poured the low sodium soy sauce over his bowl of steamed rice and ate that instead.  But his sweet tea was also great  :-)  So, for $32 (plus $6 tip) we found yet another so-so Japanese place that we won't be going back to.  (sigh)",
