    "text": "This place can be dangerous.... for the waistline.  I have a lot of fond memories of Cook-Out near college and late night runs.  This location off of Sardis Rd... used to be a backyard burger but it has been converted (for the better).  Probably the first Cook-Out I have seen that has indoor dining space.  I still have yet to try the indoor space, but the drive-thru is great.  It is a bit tricky coming in and out of the parking lot, but the cravings will help you navigate the curbs and corners.  You know a shake is good when it is so thick you can't even suck it through a straw!  They are even prepared and give you a plastic spoon to eat it with.  I guess the shake is more of a glorified ice cream served in a tall cup... but it's still great none-the-less.  Finally tried the indoor dining room!  Awesome.  I especially liked the worker who handed me my strawberry cheesecake shake.  She told me it was made with \"so much love.\"  I could tell by the way I practically inhaled it.  I made it a point to tell her how good the shake was on the way out.",

    "text": "You guys.  I love Cook Out.  This is the only location I've been to so I can't really compare it to other ones and this review is more for the whole chain than this particular place.    Ridiculously cheap for a whole meal's worth of food that tastes like real food, not like processed mush that has been sitting under a heat lamp for hours!  Fresh hush puppies, freshly grilled chicken breast which is obviously chicken, customize everything as you like it.  And the milkshakes!  Loved the pineapple and peach ones, lots of flavor and a good thick texture.  A comparable thing in SoCal would be Habit, which will set you back about twice as much (maybe a little more if you get the shake).    Also, if you're curious, there's free wifi!",

As I was eating my burger, I decided Cook Out needs to upgrade.  Shouldn't a burger at a burger joint be something you want to talk about to everyone you meet?  This is not the case.  Mind you, service was fantastic (aside from a few gnats in the restaurant).  I think Cook Out should 'up' their burgers to be some of the best burgers you can get rather than serving up 'just burgers.'",

After driving away I found that the burger I had ordered did not have lettuce or tomato, only ketchup. I did not bother going back although I was charged 10 cents for the lettuce, not a big deal but the lack of attentiveness concerns me and if they do something like that regularly it adds up. The employee that took my order was rather hasty and at the window the employee looked and acted as if they did not want to be there. I would recommend better training for their staff.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm spoiled by California's selection of fast food establishments (especially our burgers), but Cook Out didn't really do much for me. They're cheap and fast, but just alright in the quality department. I don't know what this \"cheddar cheese\" of theirs is really made of, but I think \"cheddar\" is a misnomer and I wish I had omitted it from my chilidog. Live and learn, right?  On the milkshake front, I was equally disappointed by the overly sweet, not-enough-banana flavor of my banana cream pie shake. I think that's what I had, anyway. The flavor was mostly nondescript sweetness with a hint of something banana like, so I'm really not entirely sure of what it is I had.  I suppose, in the end, I'm saying that I wouldn't go out of my way to go to a Cook Out location if you're not a local. And especially not if you're from California -- it won't meet the standards you're already used to, neither in quality nor taste. Skip it unless you're out of other options.",

The other day I was craving a chocolate milkshake so I whipped into Cook Out and it was clean, they were friendly, newly remodeled and my milkshake was delish.    So, today, I thought well, maybe I should give this Cook Out another chance, small burger, Cook Out style, chili, mustard, slaw and onion. Regular fry and a small drink. Four dolla, no holla.  That's pretty awesome.  I sit outside, sweet tea good, my burger good.  What I really liked about my burger was the steamed bun, reminded me of a beach hamburger wrapped in wax paper. But, you know, the most important Tonya question....  French Fry Barometer: Caliente! All and all, Cook Out was pretty decent. So, should I tell my friend about my adventure today? Nahhhh.",

It was fast and delicious. The cheerwine float was an interesting take on an old classic - and who doesn't love cheerwine? - and the milkshakes are just plain awesome. I tried a peach and a pineapple milkshake and they were both terrific. I'd never hesitate to get the shake here - they're cheap and among the better ones I've ever had (unlike, say, McDonald's, they taste like \"real\" food).  I had a plain chicken sandwich along with a side of slaw and hush puppies. The hush puppies were unremarkable, but the slaw was surprisingly good and the chicken sandwich tasted like a real chicken sandwich. I think what we most liked about CookOut was how genuine the food seems - it's fast food but it doesn't feel processed like the more notable chains.  And, best of all, we paid about $5 a head for 6 people. It's crazy crazy cheap. And still delicious!",

The staff's service is very consistent; my food always tastes fresh and fantastic, the milkshakes are PERFECT, and it's a very quick trip with low cost. I almost always order a big double tray when I come through, they have so many options for such a great value! I like to bring my husky doggy with me sometimes and he orders a big double with bacon and cheese. He's so happy to come through the drive thru and the staff is always very sweet to him. Thanks for such great service!",

Just like home-cooked chicken on the grill in your backyard...Minus the bugs.  The sides are hilarious-  corndog, quesadilla, chicken nuggets...  Typical concession food...  I go here for the CHICKEN!  $4.99 for drink, sandwich, two sides.  Love it.  I eat at this chain every time i visit charlotte.  I wish they had these in atlanta!",

It is a consistent spot not always are the staff friendly but most of the time they are great and my order is correct.  Young staff needs guidance and training in customer service.  Overall will always recommend as I get what I paid for and came for.  Love the budget menus and combos.",

The area around the soda dispensers is a mess. Walk up to the counter and it looks like a dirt bomb hit this place.  Seriously this isn't based on one visit. This was several trips before I said enough is enough.  If Cook Out management add corporate doesn't give a crap I'll go elsewhere.

This place seems a weekend hangout one night I passed by. The menu was very thorough and more choices than I thought they'd have.  The line was busy but not overwhelming long.  I got a cookout style burger with fries and decided to get a hot dog as well with a sweet tea.  I was asked what side besides the fries.  I asked what else were options, I heard nuggets and i asked for nuggets which I thought was odd for a side.  When I got to pay, the total was more than I was told as he handed me one of the drinks and it was the people's order behind me but mine was ready.  I get home and that side needed up being hushpuppies which had me thinking they were referred to as nuggets but it was a mix up.  I was charged the $11 but reversed immediately once the mix up was recognized.  Nevertheless, everything was tasty.",

It's nice that they are open at 2am and really really late on weekends because when everything else is shut down you can always count on CookOut! Just one complaint: I do not think it's cool that they Play the music or Muzak that they do in a restaurant! Guests dining in have to listen to Christian radio and that's not cool though I am a Christian I don't ever want to offend or demand that anyone who might not be... It's not inclusive nor is it respectful to our Jewish, bloodiest, or Muslim counterparts. As one who's traveled extensively it was incredibly intrusive and offensive When I was in Indonesia and the call to prayer several times a day was blasted out of her loudspeakers for 20 minutes... Couldn't get away from it & it was tough to listen to when you don't know the language esp...anyway they need to change their music. It has no place in a fast food joint.",
