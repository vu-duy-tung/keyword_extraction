Veggie on whole wheat was loaded with peppers and mushrooms and more. They warmed up fine when I got them home. Very yummy.",

But I really just didn't see what they were talking about. Maybe I wasn't drunk enough?   In all seriousness, I really thought it was pretty standard. I'd go back because of the convenient location to the many places I frequent on a weekend night. There's also plenty of room, and we had no problem getting our food promptly.   However, the food was pretty \"meh.\" We got a few slices of pizzas and a calzone. Temperature-wise everything was pretty lukewarm. Actually, taste-wise it was pretty lukewarm as well. I've definitely had better pizza, and I've definitely had worse.   In other words, I wouldn't go out of my way for this.",

So I ventured here after a day of running errands.  This place is a hole in the wall but do people really expect a 5-star restaurant in an old gas station?  I am sure Fuel thought a gas station was the perfect location for their concept, especially since the decor is old gas cans and car parts.  Fuel Pizza isn't the best pizza around but there are some things here that stand out over other places.    First off, the staff.  Super friendly here and interested in your opinion of their food and establishment.    Secondly, unlike many pizza joints, there's no shortage of toppings here.  My slices were covered in them!  Yay!  And finally, they deliver!!!!  How many locally owned pizza places do that anymore?",

It was supposed to be delivered by noon. The delivery driver showed up at 11 AM to make sure that everything was good. After multiple attempts from the driver to find out the status of the pizzas (and keeping in touch with me), he told me they wouldn't give him a status anymore. I called the store and sat on hold for over 10 minutes until someone finally came and hung up on their end. I called the driver again, and he put the manager on his phone. I spoke with the manager, trying to figure out why there was an issue. One pizza (out of 5 whole pizzas) was done...and it would take about an hour for the other 4 to get done. By that time, the first one was going to be cold. The manager seemed like he just didn't care. This order was roughly $120. Can't believe they don't want repeat business like that.",

The experience was standard, ordering a limited selection of cold pizza slices, calzones, garlic knots and cinnamon knots. With no line waiting, they quickly fired it up in the oven and we got in and out in no time.  Fortunately, the slice selection is better than just pepperoni or cheese slice, as you can order a supreme or meat lover style.  Unfortunately, for $3+ per slice, the quality and taste wasn't up to par. I've had fresher and better at smaller joints, mainly because they are busier and have to keep making pizzas. The location here lends to less walk-in traffic.",

I have a service dog that can smell my food allergies and this can save my life since epi pens do not work on me. I went to fuel pizza on south boulevard and was asked to show my documentation for my dog. 1 establishments can only ask me if that is a service animal 2 they can ask how my dog assists me They said they needed the documentation for my dog which is illegal. No establishment can ask that as it is a medical record protected by HIPPA. Asking for anyone's medical record is against the law.  My dog was wear a vest, which is also not legally required. The police explained to the establishment my correctness on the topic. So they then said well we just are refusing her service then. I have never been treated this disrespectful by a restaurant.",

When we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who quickly took our order - one pepperoni slice, one pepperoni/pineapple slice, with three garlic knots.    Our food was thrown into one of their monster ovens while we waited patiently at a table of our choice.  Our food was brought to us piping hot in about 3-4min.  The pizza was awesome.  The crust was solid, but not in an intrusive way.  Plenty of sauce was evening distributed across each of our slices, and there was a plethora of toppings on each slice as well.  -I like that they have plenty of condiments, pepper, napkins, ketchup, etc at each table without even having to ask. -I like that you help yourself to drinks via a Pepsi soda station to the right as you walk in.  So its as much of whatever you want drink-wise. -They DELIVER!  I feel like this may be a known but forgotten fact amongst many Charlotteans.    Its great pizza and I can't wait until I go BACK!",

There is so much pesto and tomato on it, you feel like you get what you paid for because this place isn't cheap.

Being from NY I absolutely love pizza. Pizza here just lacked everything!  First the sauce... The sauce the sauce the sauce! Where is the flavor?!? Really I think tomato soup would have more on the damn thing. The cheese... Again must be low quality, I just still am baffled at how different the pizza is amongst the chain in Charlotte.  I would say the dough is the only thing they have going for them, but it is just not cooked long enough. Throw some cornmeal on the bottom and cook the damn pizza!   I've had it delivered three times, and picked up twice.. So five times total same result. Soggy pizza, lack of flavor, and always needs to be put in the oven to crisp the dough.     Delivery is quick and service is friendly but... South blvd fuel pizza please get with uptown and figure your differences out!  I'm such a fan of them!",

The typical fare of pizza, garlic and cinnamon knots, ready made salads etc.  The slices are nice and thin as they should be if they are going for NY style.    The down side is that reheating pizza always does it a disservice, but you have to know that going in for a slice.  However, being a crust lover, when I go to NY and get a good pie I can't wait for the crust and in this case it was over cooked and the crust was burnt.  I noticed that they have mulit-grain, gluten free and lactose free options.   Cute concept with the theme and I might be back if I just want a slice but would probably defer to Brixx for better all around taste even though it is a different style of pizza.",

I asked, could we have two of the fresh slices?  One of the spaced out people behind the counter said, no we can't do that.  We would have to wait until someone bought the slice sitting out first.  Then, the soft drink counter didn't work.  And, the fork and knife machine to extract the utensils was broken.  All the tables were dirty and disheveled.  We got our food and it didn't even taste good.  Who ever owns this establishment needs to get this place together......",

The one thing I do like it you can get pizza by the slice, which is very hard to find in Charlotte.  So, with that said, every time I go back I have hope it is better, but yet it hasn't changed.    The restaurant is an order at the counter type place, while they re-heat your slice(s) or prep whatever other menu item you may have ordered, and deliver it to your table.  There are several booths and tables, but the overall set up is nothing to be impressed by. And, unfortunately the staff is hit or miss.  The employees are all pretty young and don't really seem to care about customer service.  Last night was the first time someone actually walked around and checked on tables, which was nice to see. The menu offers pizza, salads, calzones, wings and a few other items. I have always had pizza which is nothing great. Based on the fact you select you slice from pre-made pies and the slices are reheated I have never received a 'hot' slice of pizza. It is always just warmed through. I have tried a salad a few times and let me just say, Avoid It!  It is a prepackaged salad with lettuce, chopped carrots and a tomato. The lettuce is always bad and in my mind why bother. Overall it is a good spot if you aren't looking for great pizza, but a quick bite from a variety of pizza by the slice options.  If not, keep driving as there are definitely a lot of other pizza spots in the area.",

Then we waited for nearly a half hour for a small pizza, watching multiple folks go ahead of us who ordered similar or the same things get theirs. When we asked what was going on we were met with resistance. When the pizza came out it was terrible, no cheese and TONS of sauce. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Awful, awful, awful.",

The pizza that's on the shelf looks like it's been there for WAY TO LONG and old. The pizza was a -1. the same pizza we got in the picture but maybe a little worse. Taste nasty, hard and probably from last night who knows. Garlic knots were harder then a brick, the sauce for the knots was nasty. Wings tasted as if it was made before hand and tossed into the oven to warm up wasn't even crispy. Fountain machine is down. Like literally down. The tables were dirty as if wasn't clean at all. If your looking for better pizza definitely check out some local shops around town 10x fresher, 10x better customer service, 10x cleaner, and 10x cheaper. Almost all the reviews of this restaurant is True kinda wished I listened to the reviews. I do enjoy pizza and I do enjoy eating at fuel pizza but after this experience I don't know if I want to ever try out a fuel pizza restaurant again.",

The reason for any stars at all is that I like this style of pizza when executed nicely, but...  My Sunday afternoon experience started strangely when I entered the place (only one table-an employee with friend-was occupied) and had to wait a long couple of minutes before being greeted...unenthusiastically by a very sad girl who did NOT want to be there.   My husband and I each ordered a slice, just water for him and a bottled beer (one advertised as for sale) for me. The girl turned around and looked at a sad, empty cooler containing 3 ciders, 2 Mich Lights and one Bud Light. I ordered a Stella. Okay...I'll take a draft...(did they not get a beer delivery this weekend?).   She rang us up and proceeded to fish a used metal plate out of a dirty bus tub behind the counter and use that to warm up our slices (literally directly in plain sight). The pizza didn't taste fresh, was not very hot, and cost $4.50 per slice. Premium prices for warmed over food paired with horrible customer service!  This place could step it up and be so much more. I'd go back if they did.",

I will say, the slice of pizza they give you is pretty big.  Naturally, they just warm up a slice of pizza that's been sitting in the display case. My wings had to cook, so they came out hot & crispy. I got the lemon pepper flavor.  My food was really good, so couldn't really complain about the price.

    "text": "If it was possible to give this business ZERO stars for their customer service I would.    I came in last night, Saturday, March 16th, 2019 with my family for individual slices of pizza which they advertise having.  I understand it was a \"holiday\" weekend being the night before St. Patrick's Day and probably busier than normal, but the place was dirty and a mess.    We ordered our three slices and a woman behind the counter by the ovens (possibly a manager) informed us it would be around 15 minutes for them because they didn't have any available, which we didn't mind waiting for.  We preceded to wait over 30 minutes, for three slices of pizza, while we watched other customers, who were there after us, receive their entire pizzas before we did.  The restaurant was maybe half full.  I understand it was a Saturday evening and there were probably numerous carryout orders, but there was no reason we should have been waiting that long for three slices of pizza.  There were at least four other employees working at the time and the woman behind the counter seemed to be the only one actually \"working\".  There was a gentleman whose pants looked as though they were going to fall off, roaming the restaurant wearing a \"STAFF\" shirt that I'm assuming worked there as well.    After over 30 minutes of waiting, my boyfriend walked over to the counter to ask about our order.  The possible manager woman rudely snapped at him and told him that there weren't any slices available at that time and we would have to wait another 10 minutes.  My boyfriend proceeded to tell her that they shouldn't advertise having single slices if they don't have them available while they're serving entire pizzas.  He asked for his money back, which they gave him.  I work in customer service, and I would NEVER treat clients the way we were treated and I would NEVER let my business operate this way.  This location was dirty, poorly run, Falsely advertised, and overall a MAJOR disappointment.    I hope the management team and owners read this review and reevaluate their business approach.",

First, saw the sanitation at 90 and wanted to leave but whatever, I stayed and said to myself, can't be TOO bad. Overall, the restaurant is extremely dirty looking. I know it's an old building but there are things you can do to keep the restaurant clean. The drink area was dirty, like dust had built up and I felt really grossed out even taking a top for my cup from the area. Floors were dirty and sticky. Ordered two slices of pizza and so did my husband. When our food was in oven, noticed a large amount of smoke started forming and they had to open the doors. Not knowing if it was our food affected, we just waited for our food to be done and went home. And, got home, and pizza was BURNT. Why on earth would you serve us burnt pizza slices when they had tons of other slices available (of same flavors) and NO ONE was in restaurant? We would have rather waited for a fresh slice that wasn't burnt. Our clothes smelled too when we left due to the oven smoking. Probably dirty oven which is why all four slices burned. Terrible customer service. I wasted my money as I couldn't eat either slice. Garlic and cinnamon knots were extremely tough to chew. I also gave them a tip before they even started our order... that wasn't even enough for the associates to care. I will never return and don't recommend anyone eating there.

Have they made improvements?? Will it sustain?? Hopefully.  So normally I would say pizza at Fuel is flat, greasy, never hot enough for me (I think it should be hot enough to make the cheese stringy or burn the top of my mouth, not solid coagulated lukewarm cheese) and there was something missing. What was that something missing? Dunno, but perhaps in the sauce. So I just wanted a little more. i think the wings are decent and the Brad's cupcakes are small, moist and light but also missing a certain je ne sais quoi.    However the other night I stopped in and was the only person in the joint and he heated my Ultimate Mushroom pizza up to the right temperature it was poofier and the mushrooms were awesome! It wasn't greasy at all! I would give it 4.5 stars which brought up my former 2 star experiences.

    "text": "Confession: Chicago pizza has ruined me a little bit.   That aside, Fuel is a-ok in my book. It's fast, it's cheap, it fills the 'za void. But, for some reason I don't hit up this particular Fuel very often, and it's situated squarely in South End. Go figure.   For a last night slice, easy delivery or a mammoth calzone - this Fuel is aces. Convenience is key, here. And while I have eaten inside the actual restaurant, it's not the best pizza joint I've ever hung out in. The staff is hit or miss...sometimes they are super friendly and quick, other times a bit lackadaisical.   Be aware that on weekends this place can get pretty kid-packed, so if you're not a fan of stuffing your face with kiddos running around, choose pick up or delivery, son. I know I'll be back to snag a huge, cheesy calzone that will feed me for two days...especially because this Fuel is just a mile from my house. Score one for convenience!",

I actually really like the pizza here, though it's nothing special or particularly innovative/interesting. It's just standard fare, but with pizza, that normally gets the job done, right?   My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken--it's a slice with chicken, hot sauce, and some blue cheese. Really good if you're into that sort of thing, which of course I am. Definitely not for everyone though. The person I was with got some meat special, and it was good, too---pepperoni, hamburger meat, and some other stuff.   They have beer by the bottle, which is cool, and all the sodas you'd ever want. They also have hot sauce to put on your slice as you like, which is awesome.",

Never had a bad slice, never felt sick or off in the stomach afterwards.After moving back from Austin Texas and now on the west side we have chosen to get our pies from this location on South.   In a word: Greasy. Hands down the greasiest pizza pie I have ever experienced and the service is mediocre at best.  The past couple times we have gotten physically ill meaning I can now recite word for word what it says on the back of my shampoo bottle after spending so much time in the bathroom! I'm not sure if it's a matter of the people who prepare the food not properly washing their hands or what but come on. The last time we ate there and got sick was not the only time we ate there and got sick.   Bottom line: It doesn't matter how tasty the food is going in and down if it makes you feel like something is gnawing at your insides afterwards.   From now on if I want pizza I'll make the drive to the Central location. My insides rejoice in knowing this!",

We ordered a pizza and garlic knots, dine in.  We sat down and waited for thirty minutes. I was thinking, \"hey that seems a little long for a pizza\" since the place was emptying out.  I went up and asked the guy if my pizza had been cooked and about how long it may take.  After a few minutes of him doing something, other than looking for my order, he said, \"it'll be a few minutes and we will bring it out to you.\"  This interaction was clearly a brush off and a \"Why are you asking me? Get out of my face\".  I sat down and waited another 15 minutes and asked someone else the same question.  The cook looked confused and pointed to the warming case. The guy went over and grabbed it and handed it to me.  I said, \"are you serious?\"  He just handed it to me and walked away.  Needless to say, I am angry about my experience. Although I don't know what fresh fuel pizza tastes like because it had been in a warmer drawer for at least twenty minutes ,I imagine it tastes like a warmer version of the crap I ate when we got back to our apartment.  I would rank the pizza taste less than a chilled pizza hot pocket.  Not going back.  Garbage service and poor quality pizza.",

I do not like ordering a plain slice only to have it taste like something else, I was at this location once before and I asked for a buffalo chicken slice and the girl was like oh we are not making that one today unless you order a whole pie.

The wings are also very good and meaty although you have to ask for blue cheese dressing if you'd rather have that than ranch. Also neat: you can order online and they offer both whole wheat and gluten free crust options - a nice touch. At our location (Southend) the atmosphere is lively and fun.

Fuel is popular with the B2B crowd, so if you hear about a bar giving away free pizza for a promotion, it's probably Fuel pizza.

I gave it 4 stars because I think I've had more good experiences than bad, but the only thing holding it back is it's authenticity. You don't really get that True Italian or NY feel, it's more just some college kids flipping some pizzas...and believe me, I'm sure pizzas aren't the only thing getting baked around there, if you know what I mean.    Given my history and experience with this place, I can go ahead and give you a solid order: 2 slices of pepperoni & 3 garlic knots; usually to-go. I suppose to-go, because there isn't really a ton of atmosphere at this particular location.  There are a few flat screen TV's typically set to SportsCenter, and a few dated arcade games at the front. There may even be a Cruisin' USA, I can't remember. I think if they put a few beers on tap and served food from the bar, it might attract more dine-in customers...but for now, it's mostly just either order to-go, or get in & get out.   Also, what's with the large banner that self proclaims \"The Best Wings in Charlotte'? I've had 'em a few times, and they are a solid 7 out of 10. A claim like that is gonna need some references, citations, etc. However, I'll tell you what, they are probably one of the better wing-delivery options in the area....and they've definitely hit the spot during the early AM hours (delivery until 3am on the weekends).     Although, when it's all said and done, their slice is nice, and it's a good spot to grab some grub before or after hitting the SouthEnd scene. Check 'em out.",

I normally don't write reviews, but was pretty upset with my experience there this evening (and I'm still hungry), so I thought I would share.   8:40- called in to order two pizza's for delivery.  They were busy and said it would be an hour. 1 hour and 40 minutes later-no pizza, called again, they said pizza was en route. 15 minutes later (we live about 4 minutes away)- no pizza, called again.  Person put the manager on phone, who said it was put in as a pickup.  Tried to tell him that we were leaving my friend's house and to change the address to our home address...but he interrupted me and said that it would get out when they could...and hung up on me. Since we live close (and they had my credit card #), I decided to go and speak to the manager about this.  I politely expressed my displeasure with him hanging up on me and explained to him that someone there wasn't telling me the truth.  He looked at me and asked what I wanted him to do about it.  There was no apology at any time during our interaction, which really bothered me.    He made me feel like he couldn't care less that we didn't get our pizzas.  So I told him to cancel the order and left.   I wasn't rude to him, but wanted him to know that I wasn't happy with the way things were handled.   As the manager, he should have been more compassionate to the customer that had been waiting for two hours for a pizza. That's it, feel better now.  Won't be going to Fuel on principle, which is sad because we have been good customers for several years.",

I can get a slice of pizza, side salad (so I don't feel like a total pig), and drink for about $7.  If you're a meat lover, the Extreme Fuel Pizza is the best.  It's loaded with all kinds of meat.  You'll wonder where the dough is!    Don't get me wrong -- they have a variety of other food options, too, like pizzas for the whole family/group, chicken wings, bigger salads, calzones, etc., but I usually pick Fuel for lunch and get the pizza/salad combo.  As a side note, I also enjoy the theming of Fuel Pizza, particularly this one on South Blvd.  For some odd reason, I love the thought of eating my pizza in a gas station themed place.",

I'm kind of a pizza guy...and not from Charlotte originally.  Fuel is a New York style pizza...but it's not \"New York\" pizza...if you catch my drift.  If you're craving a slice of really good pizza...not your place.  If you're craving pizza and you love pizza like I do...you'll go anyhow...cuz it aint that bad.  Capiche?",

This place has a great team of folks that's what makes this place as good as it is. So its on a paper plate if you dine in... Do not judge a pizza by its plate!             They deliver they even have a take and bake ! They could be a common pizza joint but they are NOT! Do not take my word for it try it!!!!",

Had to laugh at a previous reviewer mentioning screwed-up orders. They forgot my garlic knots, and thought my wife and I were splitting an order rather than the two meals we ordered. OK in the end, though. Good place for some lunchtime pizza or late night munchies I suppose. If you want to stop in for a couple slices and a Coke (Pepsi, actually) then this is the place.",

    "text": "Definitely a fan... plus this is probably the most convenient Fuel Pizza location since it has a parking lot.  The last time I was here, it was kind of dead, but that's when the temp was like below 30 and everyone was probably smarter than I was running around in the cold.  Once you got into the place, it was nice and warm.  This location always has a cozy feel to it and the service is pretty good.  Fuel decor always fascinates me as far as the old sign-age and gas theme.  I like variety in my pizzas and always try to get something new... they can easily custom make you a pizza or you can choose what's out in the glass case already which is a pretty good selection most of the time.",

    "text": "I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is).   Their wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.    I can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \"all celery\" or vice versa.   I prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect.   I dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Bottom line:  horrible customer service (for delivery only; haven't dined in), botched order, soggy undercooked pizza, and late delivery  I ordered food from here yesterday for delivery down the street to World of Beer (where they don't serve food but have a wide selection of beer and graciously allow you to bring in food from other places).  Fuel is one of the menus they hand out to you, so I assumed there was some sort of understanding/relationship between the two establishments.  And one would think that Fuel would want to keep this arrangement going, given how many times we saw the Fuel delivery guy show up during the 4 hours we were in WOB.   When I called to place the delivery order around 1:30, the woman at Fuel copped more attitude than I think I've ever experienced from a restaurant employee.  And I order take-out and eat at restaurants a lot.  After putting me on hold to ask her manager whether they could \"do more than 4 deliveries to World of Beer\" and warning me that they would have to charge a delivery fee ($2 - big deal), she reluctantly took my order and treated me like a 12-year-old delinquent child in the process.    It would be tedious to go through the exchange I had with this employee in detail, but she was pissy enough that at one point I stopped the conversation and asked if there was any particular reason why she was acting so rude to me when I was just trying to order food.  I would have hung up then, based on principle alone, if my husband and I hadn't been so hungry.  She said that she wasn't being rude, she was just taking my order.  I was alarmed at her lack of self-awareness.  Anyway, I ordered a pizza, wings, and a salad, and she said the wait would be 30-35 minutes.  It was NFL opening day, so we expected somewhat of a delay in delivery.  Well, 1 hour and 20 minutes later, our food showed up.  The pizza was soggy and undercooked (not to mention cold, but I actually like cold pizza), the wings were skimpy and on the dry side, and they forgot our salad.  With the bad food and even worse service, I won't order from or go to this place again.",
