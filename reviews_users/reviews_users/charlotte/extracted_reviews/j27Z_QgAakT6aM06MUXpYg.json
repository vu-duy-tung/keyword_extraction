We first joked coming here because it's like an old kfc turned it a sushi restaurant. But the waitstaff is amazing. We always have Val as a server and she so friendly and attentive. We do the all you can eat deal for $20 and destroy it. Majority of the time when other restaurant do all you can eat they add a ton of rice so you get full quicker and use fake items. Not here everything is spot on. Hope you try it out and we will see you on Sunday!!!",

I have driven past it several times and thought about stopping and after I read the reviews online I decided I definitely had to give it a try. I started with the Gyoza or fried dumplings they were good, but the dipping sauce they came with was a little Bland, I then ordered the Hibachi chicken and beef, which comes with salad and soup you are supposed to get miso soup but they allowed me to change it out for the onion. it also comes with mixed vegetables for $11.95, I'm not sure what the sauces they use on the meat, but it is absolutely delicious when the plant first came I tried the rice and thought it's very Bland but then when I realized how delicious the meat was with the sauce and mix the two together, oh my goodness that was the bomb. if you happen to be around Matthews and you're in the mood for Japanese stop by Umami you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "I wanted to wait till I have a few visits under my belt to write a review.  Umami has become my new favorite when it comes to sushi. If you love sushi the first thing you should order is the Matthews roll. It's over the top delicious. It's sweet and spicy. My favorite roll of all time. Not a fan of spicy? Try the Pop pop girl. It's got cucumber to cool off the palate.  Even the hibachi is on point and our little one loves the Miso soup.  My only complaint would be I wish I could eat more when I go but for all-you-can eat at $19.99 your first order will almost exceed that price.  Love sushi? Don't love sushi but like hibachi? Give it a try.  Just save the Matthew rolls for me.",

I ordered the hibachi beef (9.95) Spider roll(7.50), California roll (4.50) spicy tuna roll(4.95)and a regular tuna roll(4.95). Let's be honest, it's your typical Japanese style restaurant. It's a place where \"you get what you pay for.\" I must say though -- the potions were surprisingly big and you also receive a miso soup and ginger salad.  They do offer all you can eat sushi for $19.99 (kids 3-6 $6.99 Kids 7-10 $11.99)  I do like the sushi bar they have, the decorations are Asian inspired. A sitting area while you wait for your take-out and a casual dining area. For the affordable prices that they offer I will continue to go here, but if you're looking for a not so plain/rainbows out of your rice Japanese meal, spend the extra bucks, skip this spot and see the other options.",

I wished there were more mushrooms and if it had sweet carrots. The entree consisted of mostly broccoli, onion, green bell pepper, and mushroom.  A thing I wished they offered are sweet carrots. I love that they offer miso and salad with the entrees even when you have your order to go.   The sushi is one point. My husband who didn't like sushi became quiet the fan of Umami's.

    "text": "We have been there when they first opened and found it to be ok, nothing fabulous but ok. I have not been since February . My Nephew(14) had heard about it at school and wanted me to take him, so off we went to eat sushi. We went at lunch time and ordered from the 19.99 all you can eat menu. We had. Edamame Tempura Calamari & Shrimp..Both of these were frozen pre-made commercial products  Seaweed Salad..Which for some reason they doused in spicy mayonnaise   We ordered some rolls from the regular roll section and they came out. they were very loose, some couldn't even be picked up with chopsticks without falling apart.They don't use sticky sushi rice, but some other sort of non clumping harder rice. I would imagine this is used to accommodate the fried rice menu  We ordered a second round of rolls from the special rolls.  They came out again way over dressed with mayonnaise and various sauces. One thing that was missing was the actual crab from the fried crab roll, salmon skin was barely noticeable, the double spicy roll was just gooey on top , so much mayo inside that it was dripping and again they were all falling apart.  We ate what we could pull out of them and left the rest. This is when our MIA waitress appeared and told us if we didn't eat it we had to pay a surcharge , To me the best part of sushi is it is some what Healthy, when it's dripping with nasty mayonnaise it is not .Then the owner came over and yelled at us and told us we had to eat it or pay extra. I had been holding my tongue and didn't tell the waitress we didn't eat it because it was gross.  Now the owner ( which another reviewer called an asshole ) came and yelled at us, I tried to explain we found it pretty nasty and had we eaten it I would have vomited . He didn't care he yelled he made it this morning and it was good. He brought us the check with a 15.00 surcharge, our crappy all you can eat 19.99 lunch totaled at 63.47. For this we could have gone to a REAL SUSHI place. While  I usually use my debit card I charged this so I can contest the surcharge.   Summation If you want quantity over quality please go but if you want to be treated with respect, eat good food stay away",

While the outside of the restaurant makes me think this is a refurbished Burger King or Wendy's, the inside is nice enough. Servers are kind and friendly. The menu is not as large as I anticipated although you will find a wide variety of rolls if you are looking for yummy sushi. Fair warning, Umami has more fresh and tasty meals when it is busy. So you might wait longer for your meal, but it's worth it since it will be fresh. I have come here when it was empty and the food was not as on point as when I have been here when it's busy. Notably, they boast an all you can eat sushi menu, for the sushi connoisseur. It is $20 all day everyday. A few more dollars than other joints, but still a bargain for the amount of food.",

The roll I ordered was dragon roll and yes, the ingredients were fresh. But the portion of eel was so disappointing. You can hardly find eel, mainly cucumbers! (As you can see in the photo) Also they forgot adding masago on the top.   If I had this roll as one of the rolls for the buffet, I wouldn't complain but it was not good enough for regular priced roll. We talked the server and they were kind enough to change the roll. Another dish, teriyaki beef and shrimp was good. I can tell they use fresh ingredients. This place is good for the buffet but I will probably not order rolls for the regular price next time.",

The restaurant itself is an old Pizza Hut that was \"converted\" into a Japanese restaurant.   The longest wait time was less than 5 minutes.  What continues to bring us back over and over again is the $19.99 all you can eat sushi. This is includes appetizers, deserts, sushi, sashimi including nigiri. The fish was fresh and the portions were generous.   If you have a family that includes young children, the menu also has smaller portion sizes suited to smaller tummies. There is a children's menu and there is also an option for children for all you can eat sushi based on age.",

I would have liked a larger portion size for the meat as it seemed more like a lunch portion than a dinner portion.   My dining partner had sushi. The rolls were beautifully presented, large, and well priced.  He was happy with his meal and very full after eating two rolls.   Unfortunately, they do not serve alcohol. I was hoping for plum wine, but no such luck. The lack of alcohol will probably keep this from being a True date night place, but we'll definitely be back for lunch.   We were impressed with the friendly staff and clean restaurant. The dining area is pretty and pleasant with lots of space. This is a much needed addition to the Matthews dining scene.  Edited to change to 5 stars, as we've eaten here 3 times in 10 days. Excellent food!",

A group of two walked in directly in front of our group of three. We were all generally greeted within about  30 seconds - great!  The group of two was seated within about a minute while our group continued to stand at the entrance...waiting to be sat. Several servers and what appeared to be hosts continued to walk by us. After an additional five minutes of no one greeting us, asking if we've been helped or any other dialogue, we left.   This was truly sad as I'd just explained to my group before arriving at the restaurant how nice the place is and how friendly the staff had been.   Unfortunately with several other nice sushi places nearby, I will think twice before returning to Umami.",

From the appetizers, I recommend the seaweed salad and calamari. Ordered a few rolls and enjoyed all of them. I like that they don't coat the rolls with too much rice so that you're just being filled up with rice. Do note that sometimes if you order many rolls, like more than 5, they will give you 2 pieces of each type of roll, maybe to save space for more? Someone who ordered more sushi than me ended up with almost the same quantity. I kinda wish they didn't do that because I know what I'm getting myself into and don't want to have to order another round after the first. Anyway, the service is prompt and friendly so I'll definitely come back if in the area.",

    "text": "I've always been bummed that my section of town has a hibachi shortage.  Luckily Matthews is not that far of a drive!  Umami has been on my radar for a while, I've just not had a chance to go there until I had a hankering for  hibachi.   They definitely delivered.  Came on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't very crowded.  There was  a large table that just came from church (sorry just assuming here), but it's not a bad place to spend your Sunday afternoon in your sunday best.  I was there, bringing the ambiance down with my jeans and hoodie, but I was treated all the same by the staff:  greeted warmly, sat at a nice table in the atrium/greenhouse area... it makes me think that this building used to be a Shoneys for some reason, but unconfirmed.  I opted for the Chicken and Steak combo.  Comes with a salad and miso soup.  Everything was delicious and definitely a more unique hibachi style than I am used to.  The protein isn't cubed form but rather long portions - I think the chicken is probably tenderized and portioned out, but the increased surface area allows for more of the grill flavor and vegetables to infuse into the protein.  The veggies that come with the hibachi are usually after-thoughts, but here, they shine and are delicious.  Overall a GREAT hibachi experience and a TON of food.  I managed to down everything in one sitting, but it was after a long run and I was super hungry.",

Kids pediatrician visit was over and we needed something quick and close by so we decided to give Umami a try. Very glad we did. I had the chef's choice sushi dinner and it came with a side salad and miso soup. Sushi was fresh and delicious. The family had a various assortment of noodles and rice dishes that did not disappoint. They had the tall silver Sapporo so daddy was happy.  If you are in the area and are craving some tasty sushi, you should definitely give Umami a try.",

The only thing stopping me from rating a '5' is that they use imitation crab, so that limited our choices some. Otherwise, it is a '5' in all other respects (I wish a could give a 4.5!).

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly waitress. Place was very homely and small (NOT in a bad way) and there were 12 tables MAX there.  I checked every box that I wanted under the blue AYCE menu and I realized that I had cemented my fate. I had to finish everything, but I knew I would. It took about ten minutes for the waitress to come back with the four different rolls I ordered and this made me super excited because a majority of other sushi places have me waiting close to 25-30 minutes!  Each bite of the spicy rolls and the ones dripping in spicy mayo and sauce gave me such a euphoric feeling that I couldn't help but smile at the window. I probably looked pretty weird to everyone else eating in there but I didn't care. I finished everything and thanked the waitress for being so kind and courteous to me!   Enjoy your five stars, I'll be back :-)",

They have normal menu and All You Can Eat with relatively good and fresh sushi place for the price. If you're a sushi fan, it's always better to do the AYCE for $20 because two normal rolls will be around $20 anyway. This was my first AYCE sushi restaurant - I started with the mushroom soup (that was excellent), had some clam, octopus, and squid nigiri (great and fresh), gyoza dumplings, then had a couple sushi rolls. Sushi was not the best sushi I've ever had, but the price is a steal especially if you're craving little things here and there. The rolls are full sized rolls and I wish they did half sizes so I could try more options. The only things I didn't like out of what I had were the egg rolls and I thought the sauces they had to pair with some of the appetizers were strange and didn't go with the meal. Overall pleasant experience",

    "text": "So, I really hate to post bad reviews, but I felt this was necessary to save others from the experiences my friend and I had.   First off, it should be noted that the staff was exceptionally friendly to use the 3 times we went, and the food is ok. Nothing great, but passable. Also, we had both been previous years and had good experiences, which is why we gave it another try.   Here is the issue. We got sick every time. Months apart.   The first time, I went last summer. Now, I chalked it up to \"heat stroke\" because I had sushi and then went out and walked back to work in the sun. I was very nauseated and had an upset stomach for about an hour.   Then, my friend went a month ago. She had the same experience. She felt extremely ill and was actually laying curled on the bathroom floor, but it resolved in a couple hours.  Then today, she decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it another chance. So, she went and had hibachi chicken. Sat there for about 15 minutes after on the phone and started to feel rough. She went outside to get in the car and ended up vomiting in the parking lot.   So, I am not sure what the issue is, perhaps contamination due to use of raw fish... but please exercise caution. I know none of us like food poisoning and I would hate for it to be a worse case next time.   *cough* salmonella *cough*  So, I don't wanna ruin their business, but I had to warn others.",

The hostess did then inform me that the chef had failed to notice the beef dish so I would have to wait a bit longer for the whole order. By the time I got home the tempura was ice cold and and not crispy at all. The other two dishes were ok but not anything to rave about.

Server was prompt, polite, and brought my oldest easy chopsticks without us having to ask.  The food was delicious, portions large for lunch, and well priced.  Dinning area was clean, spacious and well decorated.  We will be back.",

Nothing but good things from her. Favorites were the Matthews roll and Crunchy Shrimp roll. I will definitely try the sushi in the near future. Also, service was quick and friendly. Check them out. I know I'll be back.",

Someone else with me had a hibachi chicken and shrimp plate which was also very tasty. Will definitely be back again and would absolutely recommend this restaurant to others!",
