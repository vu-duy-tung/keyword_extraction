    "text": "This is an upscale Asian restaurant, with a very nice ambiance. I suppose you can come here and hang out with a group of friend after work if you are nearby. It also has a well stocked bar, which is nice if you want to come here to have drinks and sample appetizers. I got the chicken pad thai, it was nice, one of the cheapest items on the menu. The dish arrived fairly quickly after I ordered. I did not want to spend a lot seeing that it's just noodle. I have tried a lot of Thai place and this is definitely NOT one of the more authentic ones. I think this place is trying to cater more to an upscale feel than trying to make their food a super star. I paid about $13 for Pad thai. I think at else where, I could have gotten an appetizer and a spring roll and salad on the side for that pice. I think there are more notable restaurants around the area, and this one is not exactly a place for foodie.",

Been here numerous times for lunch and mostly always order either the shrimp fried rice or green curry chicken, both thai hot. The Som Tum (green papaya salad) is really good as well. The thing is, its pretty rare for someone who likes Thai food to walk out of this place disappointed.  Tips -   * for lunch, make sure you get here before 11:30. Otherwise be prepared to wait about 20-30 mins to be seated. They do not take reservations for lunch.  * for dinner, make reservations as early in the day as you can. They do run out if you're calling for dinner reservations on Fridays or Saturdays.",

We valeted for $5, which they add to your bill so you don't need cash (why doesn't every restaurant do this?) My friend had only tried Pad Thai and wanted to branch out, so I recommended the Green Curry for her, she loved it, b/c she can handle spice. For apps we had Chicken Satay which was truly delicious. I ordered the Masaman Curry (which I get at all thai places) and it was by far the best I have had. It also cost about $4 more than I usually spend, but totally worth it. Our waiter was good. We went on a Friday night and didn't have reservations (which I think are recommended) so we had to wait at the bar for a bit, but we shared a bottle of wine, so I guess it was ok :) overall, great experience and delicious food",

And this is why I always find it a little weird that they charge a dollar or so more than a regular Thai place for completely standard Thai food.  Really, this is my only objection to this place.  I know the location is good and there aren't lots of Thai places around here, so I guess that's the reason for the mark-up.   Specifically, on the food, I've had the pad thai, basil with tofu, ginger chicken, green curry with chicken--and all of them have been equally fine. I would say that pad thai could be a bit more sauced, but other that it is very good.  So if you are craving Thai and have an extra dollar or two in your pocket to burn, then this place is worth an occasional visit.",

The egg rolls (veggie) were good, but you only get 2 of them.  My first gripe was that they would not make their Som Tum (green papaya) salad vegetarian for me by omitting the fish sauce.  This is so unaccommodating.  Then I asked for no onions and scallions, but they came out with both and the wrong dressing.  I believe it was the fault of the kitchen because the waiter did write it down.  After waiting at least 10 minutes for my \"fixed\" salad I still found bit of both onions and scallions, so there's a good chance it was picked through.  So frustrating.    My husband had the pad thai (small portion) but he liked it and was happy that it had shrimp and chicken.  The menu is not that big.    For 4 drinks, 2 eggs rolls, a salad and small pad thai it was about $75.  We won't be going back.",

Thought it would be too sweet, but it was perfect! Then I added in some chili garlic sauce and it was even better!!! I got the pad Thai and it was great, not too many peanuts, I hate that! My boyfriend got the pad see ew and really liked it as well. A friend of ours got the curry chicken and it had a wonderful flavor. The portions are large, you could really share a dish.

The coconut chicken soup had too much coconut in it which was all at the bottom of the container. The beef salad was just OK as well, beef was overcooked and there was too much fish sauce in it. Tofu pad see eu was not that great, the noodles were too hard and overly sweet. I have also been really missing thai iced tea so I decided to get that and was very disappointed. There was no tea flavor and just artificial flavoring to it and tons of sugar.",

We were the only table over there for about 30 min. The music was too low and sounded too much like a spa or something. The server was not much better. I think she had tables on the other side (the good side apparently) and she wasn't around very much. The food came out and only 2 of the 4 of us had silverware. So we waited and waited. Finally we just took it off of another table. We felt like we were just a distraction to her. Drinks never got refilled, never checked to see how the food was and just had a bad attitude in general.   I would give 0 stars for service, 0 for atmosphere and 5 for the excellent food.",

The restaurant is dimly lit for a more romantic feel or when visiting with family and/or friends I would describe the lighting as intimate. It makes everyone feel like they are sitting at a table in one of the participants house and very comfortable to talk and laugh and have a great dinner. The FOOD: Tasty and prepared to perfection.. We have made this place one of our signature restaurants to take guest when they are in town and interested in a nice glass of wine and good Thai food.  We had Ginger Tofu with veggies - Seafood Basil with Veggies & the teenager had Chicken Fried Rice (Go Figure). Our favorite appetizer is the Shrimp Spring Roll it is so FRESH and flavorful especially the dipping sauce which compliments the flavor perfectly. This place is a really popular restaurant all days of the week and especially on the weekend as you should ensure you call ahead and make reservations to avoid a wait. The servers are very friendly and helpful, they are quick to offer up suggestions and provide honest feedback on the items on the menu. The VIBE: Very trendy small bar atmosphere when in that area, however in the dining area you can get anything from business lunch/dinner to datenight feel.  When we had family in town I walked to the restroom with a friend and she was curious so we stepped on the other side and a manager quickly came over to walk us through and answer our inquiries about the additional space. He was very friendly and even gave me a heads up about the new location which is NOW OPEN since I visited the UpTown location and I LOVE IT.",

My pad kee mao was also similarly weak in flavor, and the noodles used for it were woefully thin, both in width and in in thickness. They reminded me more of the noodles used in pad thai instead. The flavors in the pad kee mao were good, barring the lack of heat.   All in all, both my girlfriend and I agreed that this falls under the umbrella of \"Asian food for white people\".",

They don't have lunch specials that most big cities offer which makes me feel like they are snobbish in their offering! On top of that they have bad service - their waiters serve like they hate their jobs and are the least bit friendly. I went at around 1.30PM for lunch to avoid the rush hour and wanted to be seated in a bigger table and the hostess rolled her eyes for the request. Then my waiter was the least friendly person I have met. I have been here twice thinking I will give it another try after first bad experience but it did not get any better the second time. Sorry Basil Thai, you need to step up your game, else your reviews are going to suck!",

Pad See Iu was just thick rice noodle with soy sauce. Pad Thai had not nearly enough peanut or flavor. I could go on considering I ordered two other dishes as well but overall you're paying for the ambience of being inside the restaurant. First time trying the food and the last time.",

Well thats exactly what Michael THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS did to my party yesterday evening during our business meeting! Our server provided OK service so she received an OK tip. She didnt go above and beyond and she walked past our table shaking her head and rolling her eyes even after we tipped her!  But nevertheless, you dont ask someone why the gratuity was so low! Asking us how the service was, would have been enough. How rude! This is somewhere I actually love to eat but ill never visit this location again, and I will never have a business meeting here again.  I appreciate the owner coming over to apologize for Michael's unprofessional behavior but they really should invest in better hospitality training. i know the perfect company that could help them....MINE!",

    "text": "I really had a great experience at Basil Thai.  I found the atmosphere to be sophisticated, with a very cool \"uptown\" vibe.  It is dimly lit and rather small so there is limited seating.  Some of the tables seemed to be on top of one another but it still \"worked.\"  The service was solid, friendly and consistent throughout our evening.  We had a party of 6 chatty, giggly women and our server handled us all quite well.  He was on top of his game and new the menu well.  His upselling was very subtle so it didn't bother me at all.  I went with a pretty basic meal...pad thai but it was very good!  The only thing I would say is that I wish it was a little spicier.  The waiter informed us that it does not come with spice but you can add mild, medium or hot spices to the dish.  I went with medium and it still didn't give it much pizazz!  I also didn't taste the \"peanut\" sauce at all.  The dish was good but I would have enjoyed a few more pieces of shrimp and a little more flavor/spice.  I will definitely come back.  I would love to try their curry dishes.  One other thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the fact that they pour a very small glass of wine.  We estimated that it must be around 4oz but yet you pay full price (8-12 dollars).  The location is key and if you go there for dinner you are surrounded by other \"fun\" spots if you choose to continue your evening in the uptown area.  You are right there across from 5 Church, next to Dandelion Market, near Cowbell, Roxbury and a few other places.    I'll be back!",

There was a good many drunk people from the bar crawl downtown so it was way more packed than I feel a typical Saturday night would have been. But our group was seated fairly quickly. Starting with the bar...they have three beers on tap two local and Sapporo. They also have the soaking pineapple which I've seen at many other restaurants but this one is made into a mojito. I opted for that. It was delicious.  The service was slooooooow. But as I stated there were a ton of rowdy intoxicated people so I feel like our sweet server was dealing with a lot. So I did not take that into consideration in the rating. The food is a pretty typical Thai menu. I thought the prices were very reasonable but the entrees portion on the back of the menu is where we ordered from. I tried the garlic an black bean sauce and added shrimp to it. My fiance had the sweet and sour and added chicken. They were both really good. Delicious taste. And they had the option of brown rice or white rice which was great. The price is great but in comparison with the amount of food you get is in line with that. Overall it's a must try if you are looking for the best Thai food in the area.",

It is something just as traditional as Pad Thai, but better in taste in my opinion.  Basil does a good job of customizing it for me (since I order it every visit)  they are always accommodating if I substitute or add extra cashews.  The portion size is perfect.  I always have a to-go box and it is just as good for lunch the next day.  Only complaint:  Service has been hit or miss.  I have a tendency to get the same waiter who just seems unenthusiastic about EVERYTHING.  Since Basil is not exactly \"cheap\" they should be more selective in picking out their wait staff.

    "text": "If you are craving some Thai and uptown, Basil is worth the walk. The flavors are good and the food is fresh. Pad See-Eu and Pad Woon Sen are two of my favorites on the menu. Pad Woon Sen is one of the best season dishes on the menu, try it \"Thai hot\" for a little bit of enhanced flavor.  Why not 5 stars? A couple minor issues. Depending on who is working in the kitchen and on your food, the portion sizes are uneven. It is fine 80% of the time, but about 2 out of 10 trips, you feel like the person working in the line gave you a half portion? The food takes a while to serve at lunch, which is a good and bad sign. Good, since they likely make it to order; bad, due to the time it takes to get in and get out on a work day.  That aside, go to Basil, go have some good Thai food.",

Our table had an appetizer sample plate, some red curry, pad Thai, veg fried rice, and shrimp fried rice. The food was somewhat average and definitely not worth the $15 average for somewhat smaller portions than other places might give. It was still a lot of food, but definitely pricey for average Thai. We also waited a long time between sitting, ordering, getting water refilled, and getting the check.",

Before Basils was established in Charlotte my family and I would drive all the way to Charleston for a day trip to eat at Basils.   Here are my top 5 picks at Basils:  #1 Pad See-Eu with beef: great noodle dish with a semi sweet brown sauce and broccoli. 8 times out of 10 this is the dish I order.  #2 Neua Nam Tok- yes it's an appetizer but it's one you don't want to skip. The marinated steak is amazing and switch the cabbage for lettuce!   #3 Ginger with Chicken and White rice- pretty much an amazing stir fry with great flavor.  #4 coconut chicken soup- not too much coconut flavor so don't be scared to try it ! It's amazing !!   #5 Red curry- this dish is still great even though it's last on my list. I just can't make everything #1 :)",

We can on a Sunday at 8:3 pm and it was still fairly busy, although, we are able to be seated immediately.   I enjoyed the trendy atmosphere and the mood lighting makes Basil a great place for date night!   The prices are rather good for somewhere located uptown. You will spend about $14-18 per meal. My husband had the Green Curry and while it was quite different from something we normally order the flavors were complex but delicious! I ordered the pad Thai which is their most popular dish. I agree with the previous reviews, this is not the best I've ever had by far but it was good. I felt like even though I asked it to be spicy it wasn't at all which seems to be the case based on my fellow Yelpers reviews. It was very heavy on the fish sauce.   I asked the waitress for some Siriacha and she never came back to our table till we were completely don't with our meal and waiting on the check. It too forever to get the check. It was kind of busy in there but I wish she had been quicker with the service.   Bonus Tips: The portions are huge! There is no need to order appetizers if you plan on eating your whole meal. I heard the dessert was delicious but we will have to try that another time.",

We showed up about 5 minutes early and instead of waiting, they went ahead and seated us. All my previous visits, I had had the pad thai. No complaints, everything was delicious, but I branched out just a hair and opted for the red curry chicken this time. Once again, not disappointed. A healthy helping of rice and chicken, although it was not as spicy as I was anticipating. Would definitely ask for a higher spice grade next time.   The vibe is very cool inside with a lot of interesting art work. I really enjoy going to Basil on occasion, and would recommend it wholeheartedly.",

I got water and it was never refilled so I ran out early and didn't see our wait staff until the time for the bill.

Probably some of the most beautiful presentation of Thai food I have ever seen. In particular, the Thai chicken wing was YUMMY!! It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the best part is... Not greasy at all! The pad thai was also yummy a bit sweet for my taste.   The bad: The bill....So I split the chicken wing with another coworker ( we told the waitress it was going to be split with two people) but at the end of the other coworker who came in late and did not eat a single chicken wings was charged with 1/3 of the wings to her bill. I was also charged with the peanut sauce for the Basil Roll ordered by my coworker. Sure, the amount was not much but it was still not pleasant to be charged with the wrong amount. Especially when we only had 3 people. But I also understand the waitress might have an off night during a busy time. Hopefully this won't be the norm.  Overall, a good place to satisfy your Thai craving with aesthetic pleasing food.",

    "text": "The food here is good, but the policies implemented by the owner/manager/whoever make a visit to Basil less than desirable. For a place with this price point, they should really try to make the customer's experience easy and enjoyable, not annoying and frustrating from the moment you try and get a table.   For lunch, they claim to not take reservations but when I arrived at the hostess stand, I was asked if I had a reservation for my party of 8. Because you can't have a reservation (even if you call ahead days in advance), the wait time can get very long, especially at lunch time.   They also won't seat you unless your whole party is present. That policy makes some sense, but I've been to places where only 50% of the party needs to be present to be seated (to accommodate for the friend who is always late).   The policy that made us the most upset was recently put into place. For parties for 8 or more, checks can't be split. This makes no sense. I came with a group of coworkers for lunch and since a corporate card isn't easy to acquire, we spent about half of our lunch hour downloading and setting up venmo acocunts.   If you plan on coming here with friends, make sure you all have venmo, the party is all present at the host stand, and come at an offbeat time. The wait time during lunch can be outrageous. If you can't meet the criteria above, there are tons of other great restaurants within walking distance.",

Were told that we could not pay separately and had to be one check. We obliged. Next when one of my vegetarian team members ordered fried rice without egg it became the biggest issue on earth. According to their new policy they cannot remove eggs from any of their dishes because it \"destroys the integrity of the dish\". The manager came to our table and singled out the \" who is person who ordered the fried rice without the egg\" to discuss this. She came in like a charging bull and said \"I will not remove the eggs for you\". I'm absolutely disgusted at the service and the way this message was handled to a paying customer.   I started my first job in customer service and I know what kind of service should be expected from a popular establishment such as this. Even though I have no dietary restrictions and can \"kinda\" understand the flavor being impacted by removing an ingredient, someone needs to be trained on how to provide service to a paying customer let alone 12 in this industry. Shameful",

Both times, the food was great, but stars marked off for price and service. We were visiting from a larger North Eastern city with the food prices are similar to Charlotte, but found Basil to be a little off the mean in that sense. $18 for takeout pad thai? No.   Will also say that during our in person visit, the service was sub par. We each ordered soup as an appetizer and were asked if we wanted small or large, assuming the choice to be bowl or cup. We both ordered large, and were extremely surprised to received a HUGE pot of soup that is designed to serve multiple people. The waitress knew it was just two of us, and we each ordered a different soup. Pretty dishonest to offer a 'large' soup that serves 4 people to a single person who ordered it as an appetizer. Afterwards, it took an additional 30 minutes for our \"entrees\" to come out, which turned out to be appetizer sized portions that were not billed as such on the menu. Again, overpriced considering portion.    Again, I'll reiterate that everything was delicious, but considering price and bad service, I'll be looking elsewhere on our next visit.",

I dined there this past weekend and I was majorly disappointed - I have been hearing negative things about Basil for a few months by colleagues and friends and I would not believe it but they were True! The quality of their food has seriously deteriorated - the food tasted mediocre at best (I have made better pad thai in my kitchen) and their portion sizes were way smaller for the same prices. The pad thai was soggy and sweet and their crispy duck was swimming  in a bland, thin and cold curry. What I used to find appealing about Basil was its ambiance - upscale and trendy - sadly no more - there were little kids crying (after 10 pm) and their tables, chairs and decor had so much wear and tear.   Unfortunately, I would not go back here - not for their current prices.",

    "text": "My last visit to BASIL THAI was a week after Thanksgiving.  It was a total BUST.  We had several OUT OF TOWN family members who extended their holiday visit so we decided to treat them to a dinner at Basil.  Our party numbered 8 so to be sure everything went smoothly we made our reservation giving them 24 hour notice.  The next day our party assembled & we made our way to Basil.  We were seated about 15mins after we arrived ... BAD SIGN.  We're normally seated within a few mins in the main dining room --- usually a GREAT BOOTH.  This visit we were taken to a section I had no prior knowledge even existed ... THE DUNGEON!  I call it that because its basically in the basement with no windows far away from the main dining area.  There were several other large parties like ours seated in this section.  THE FOOD AND WAIT SERVICE WERE JUST AWFUL!  Surprising because normally both are great.  In this section the service was extremely slow and the food was served barely warm.  The other parties received the same poor service & they were complaining LOUDLY!  When our table was presented w/ the check our server apologized for the horrible food & service & told us we should tip him whatever we thought was fair!   We did exactly that so he wasn't surprised to receive 5% on a large tab.  Had it not been for my own experience as a teen waitress the tip would've been ZERO!  I would NOT RECOMMEND BASIL THAI CUISINE FOR LARGE PARTIES because they are not equipped in any fashion to satisfactorily serve.  No matter what - - -  NEVER ALLOW THEM TO SEAT YOU IN THEIR DUNGEON!  If you're wondering if we'll ever return to Basil ... the answer is a resounding NO!",

While the dish was good, it was no where near that would qualify as Thai hot at an authentic Thai place back in Boston. However, it was tasty.

Originally from Atlanta, where Asian foods, (and Thai) are readily available, I found this place to my preference when it came to Asian foods in Charlotte.  I almost always got the (sometimes extra spicy) spicy basil beef, and it was just the right amount of spicy that kind of burns your tongue a little but doesn't cause you to run in search of milk.  Not sure what the dinner menu is like, but I assume it's more expensive.  I wouldn't pay more than the lunch price for a meal here.",

Upon arrival we were given a hard time about not having a reservation at 5pm on a Sunday when only two tables were occupied. Not the most stellar reception.   We started the meal off with some pretty average cocktails and the fresh basil rolls. They were oozing with grease and completely devoid of flavor.   As our entrees we split pad Thai and the basil mixed seafood. The pad Thai was amazing!!! One of the better versions I have ever had. The mixed seafood wasn't terribly flavorful other than the spice that we had requested. The fish was a bit chewy, but not offensive.   I would definitely pick up some pad Thai to go in the future!",

It has a very cool, urban atmosphere when you walk in and it's right on the corner so it gets lots of good light.  The dining room is not huge but I've never had to wait very long, if at all. There is also an outdoor dining area as well.    The food is fresh and they do a good job of customizing the dishes to fit your taste.  It is a little more pricey than some of the other Thai places but a lot of that is due to the location.  I am a big fan of the coconut chicken soup and the shrimp hot and sour.  For main courses, I like the red curry chicken with bamboo shoots, basil, and peppers.  The desserts are awesome and unique.  If you go here, either bring a hella appetite or be prepared to pack up your leftovers to go.  Free valet parking is an added bonus, just pull up to the curb and let them take it away!",

This afternoon friends and I decided to enjoy a nice lunch at your restaurant but Toby was quickly to pre-judge and make disrespectful comments upon our entrance that he didnt want us to dine with Basil if we couldn't keep our behavior controlled. Our group of guest felt his comments to be very disturbing as we are intelligent individuals that dine frequently at Basil and know how to carry ourselves in a resturant setting. If Toby's rude assumptions are the image Basil represents, I highly recommend you revaluate your front end customer service manager. Thank you hostess for recommending we make a formal complaint.

    "text": "Abysmal service and mediocre food. Where do I begin? Decided to celebrate my sister's birthday here with a few girlfriends. The place seemed nice enough when we checked it out on the web and we were not disappointed when we walked in with the cool Asian fusion decor and contemporary looking bar. I thought it was a little odd that instead of a coat check, there was a rack near the entrance where people just hung their coats with no kind of check system what so ever, but decided to go with the flow. So we sat at the bar and ordered a round of drinks while we waited for our friends. The drinks came and things began to go downhill. I had a pear martini and it was bland and bitter. I'm thinking to myself how in the world do you mess that up?  They sat us in the lower section of the restaurant because we were a party of 10 and things went from bad to worse when we met our server. She ambled around lethargically pouring water into our glasses without as much as a greeting. When I told her it was our first time at the restaurant she pretty much just shrugged. I asked her if she can give me a recommendation of what to order and she said she likes the egg rolls and fried wontons. I was like WTF? Our appetizers came and our server disappeared. I kept looking around because I really wanted to order a drink. We all kept looking around the table thinking 'and we're obligated to tip you because we're a party of 10?' I was prepared to argue against paying the mandatory tip because the service was so dreadful.  The server eventually returned and took our entree and drink orders. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our drinks. About 15 minutes later a young man came and placed a bowl of rice on the table and walked away with no explanation. Once again we all looked at each other like WTF? Just then a man ran from the back of the room with an A-frame ladder and in the midst of all this chaos our food began to arrive. The server explained that the 'system' was down throughout the restaurant.  We finished our dinner without seeing our server. We were never checked on to see how we were doing or if we needed anything else or a refill on our drinks. Nothing. Next time we saw our server she was explaining to us that when we pay she will have to make an imprint of our credit cards so they can bill us later when the system comes back online. \"What if we only have cash?\" I asked. \"Will we be held hostage until the system is up?\" She fetched the manager who was clearly frazzled as he barked at us the system is down and we have to wait till it gets on line. The manager stated the best he could do was remove the tip from the bill.  The only reason I didn't throw a couple of 20's on the table and walk out was because it was my sister's birthday and I wanted to salvage what was left of it. The system came back on line a few minutes later and I paid the bill with cash. The server had the audacity to ask if I wanted change. I almost laughed out loud. Needless to say I took all of my change with me. This is one place I will not patronize again.",

The Pad See-ew I ordered was tasty, perhaps a bit too salty, but the wide flat noodles and heaps of chicken made for a nice lunch.  Note: it's heavy on garlic, so I'd suggest you not hold any post lunch meetings that day.    So whats the caveat?  Well it's minor but odd enough I felt justified mentioning...The host, a gentleman, who \"seated\" me was terribly quirky and very particular on the seating arrangements.  I was dining alone, so I was told to sit \"anywhere I liked\" in the bar room area.  Then he corrected himself and said \"anywhere at the bar\" and then he walked me to the bar and said \"any one of these two seats,\" and then asked me to slide the seat over after choosing for some mumbled reason.  At the end of my meal I witnessed him do the same thing to another solo diner.    Look, I get it that you want to maximize your lunch seating if you're going to be busy, but please don't give me the illusion of a choice of seat.  If you want your solo diners to sit somewhere specific walk them to the location and seat them.",

    "text": "Fairly standard Thai fare in a nicely appointed restaurant in Uptown Charlotte.  The crowd is heavy during the lunch rush hour, and it's fairly easy to see why.  The menu is a decent collection of straightforward Thai dishes, not too much exploration.  The service we had was awful I have to say.  I asked about the special (noodle bowl) wondering if it was hot, both temperature and spicy level.  I literally said that, \"both temperature and spicy\" and the waiter half-assed said, yep, it's hot.  It wasn't either.  It was a cold noodle bowl and the spice was in the sauce.  Technically I guess you could say it was spicy, but only after I doused the noodles in the sauce which was served on the side.    The other issue I have with this place is the price.  All entrees are $9-13+ and they do not come with a soup or salad or bread or anything but poor service.  I'm happy to pay more for a higher quality offering, but I'm just not convinced the value they're offering is worth it.",

    "text": "I've had several really consistent experiences at this Charleston-transplanted Thai house.  I dig the modern and minimal interior, with its very appropriate \"uptown\" feel, accentuated by the dim lighting and servers dressed in all black.  I have found the waitstaff to be solid, friendly and consistent throughout our visits, with good knowledge of the menu and recommendations where needed. Those with prior Thai experience will see most of the standards on the menu here: plenty of noodle and rice dishes, served with your choice of protein, or curried dishes to pack in a bit of spice.  House specialities are familiar, but well-executed (particularly the whole fish and duck).    Largely Americanized, the dishes can be made spicier upon request.  Saying nothing usually results in a rather mild dish.  Also, as everyone tends to do their \"standards\" just a bit differently, your experience with your \"go-to\" favorites will vary here.  I, for example, do not care for their take on Pad Thai: lacking in peanut flavor and a bit too \"sweet\" for what I have come to like in that dish.  Your mileage will vary, so just keep that in mind.  Drinks are a bit on the pricy side here, and I bemoan the loss of half price wine night on Sundays (it's now 1/3 off), but this is uptown and the price point is on-par with the higher-end neighbors.  A couple of interesting cocktails on the menu will get things started for those just looking to bar-hop.  Do use the \"free\" valet parking here, as otherwise you're pressing your luck for a space on the street or paying a hefty fee to use one of the not-so-close decks.  Given then steep hill the front door is on, it's better to let the pros do it, IMHO.  But, once you're done you are in the middle of the \"uptown\" action: very easy to get around to some of the other hot spots in this area.  In all, this is a welcome presence in uptown for the diversity of cuisine in an upscale setting.",

I have tried maseman curry, green curry, pad Thai, pad kee mow, pad kee sew, and black pepper garlic beef. All have been outstanding! Don't be afraid to go for the spices!!  Updated: I used to be a weekly regular at basil. Since their recent change in management and staff I have been disappointed over and over. The spice is inconsistent, flavor is lacking and the staff is not knowledgeable about the menu. They cut back on sauce (why??) in my favorite dish which is disappointing. Take out orders have been wrong on a few occasions and both me and people I'm dining with have sent food back recently. Management doesn't seem to care. Basil, you use to take a big chunk of my paychecks but now I will go elsewhere. :(",

The rice they provided was of poor quality and in no way sticky. Be sure to ask for extra pepper and they'll bring you a tray of three options.   This place is good for those who aren't sure they will like Thai. The food is unoffensive to your tastebuds but nothing exciting for those who like a more traditional flavors. It's the Jay Leno of Thai Food",

I have to let it be known that I am not a huge Thai food fan, partly due to biting into a chunk of galangal root floating in some soup years ago during my first Thai meal.  I thought it was a carrot, who knew it was in there for flavor only!?!?!  That said, I've had hit and miss Thai experiences since then but when the hits, hit... I've been quite happy and love the flavors.  Basil was another on the list of hits and I would go back in a nano second.  I had the Beef Prik King which was uber-tender slices of beef, green beans and a just right heat level brown sauce.  I was tempted to tip up my plate and drink the sauce.  It was that good.  Others at the table had green and red curry dishes, Pad Thai and a ginger chicken and all were pleased with their meals.  Service was on point though a little on the flat side personality wise and we were in and out quickly.",

Several of the reviews complained about Dine-In experience & so we decided to order take-out. We ordered 1) Pad Thai 2) Red Curry crispy duck (since we heard is the chef special and 3) Green curry with Tofu 1) Pad Thai - for the price, I would expect a decent portion, but to no avail. I have had better Pad Thai at other restaurants. The lime was wilted, unusable. 2) Red curry crispy duck - The duck was moist & sauce flavorful, but very minimal sauce & veggies given. For $23 I expect greatness. 3) Green curry with Tofu - flavorful. Enjoyed it. All-in-all, not worth the money. I am happy that I tried take-out, as my face would show disappointment if I was dining at the establishment. I will/would not recommend this place to anyone who is interested in getting their money's worth.",

    "text": "A solid 3.5.  Basil Thai is a great place to walk by and smell the smells. You read that right; the restaurant gives off an intoxicating aroma that is downright incredible. Sadly, I didn't find the taste lived up to that amazing scent this time.     We tried many of the appetizers which I thought were good. I especially enjoyed the stuffed shrimp and basil rolls. For my entree the server recommended the Chicken Prik King with medium spice. While it was spiced just fine, the dish primarily consisted of under-cooked string beans. My meal had very little chicken (or anything other than the beans) and the squeaky texture was off-putting.    Our server took so long to take the order (almost an hour after we sat) so I just kind of dealt with what I was served because I was really hungry at that point. Once the order was taken it did move along a little faster thankfully. Overall our server was a nice guy so no complaints as far as that goes.   The place itself is very nice and can accommodate a larger party nicely due to the back room. I've gone for drinks and they have always been delicious. One other thing to mention is that prices are pretty high, probably due to the Uptown rent.   Siam Garden is still my go-to Thai spot for now, but I will have to give them another shot since I always hear raves about this place.",

Decent food on the whole, have had some very uninspiring dishes (avoid the duck, unfortunately), but the staples like Pad Thai/Fried Rices/Salads are solid and so I keep coming back. No spiciness to be found, this is AmeriThai. Quality doesn't justify the price, you're paying for location and decor. Portions are a bit undersized as they occupy plate space with ample garnishments. The menu itself is oddly laid out, the entrees are listed on the back of the tri-fold menu, opposite the beverages and kind of hidden. Never had any issues with service, been pretty good on that front.  I give these guys my business far more than I would like because I love Thai food and there is not a better option in this city. I'd be a regular if they'd step their game up, but it seems like they're happy with the profitable racket they've got going. Good for them I guess.",

Fried Wontons: these were delicious and I enjoyed dipping them in the sweet and sour sauce Tom Yum Kung soup: this was my favorite! The soup was tasty, it was also served in a dish with a flame coming out of the middle to help keep it warm.  Wonton Soup: I do love Wonton Soup but did not care for this one so I happily split the other soup with one of my friends.  Green Curry: the least favorite thing that we ordered, it was a bit too spicy for my liking. Tasty entree options that I recommend: Sweet and Sour Shrimp and Pad Thai, you also get a container of rice to eat with the entrees.  All of this for less than $100 split between 5 of us, I forgot how cheap dining out is when alcohol is not involved. Definitely recommend Basil Thai!",

While all of the servers and the manager smiled at us, the food took forever.  Our soup came out right away, but then we must've waited an hour for dinner. Everybody was smiles and friendly, but nobody  acknowledged the elephant in the room. The manager even came over to chat with us, he smiled weirdly at us and made uncomfortable forced small talk, but never apologized for the delay. Just weird.  OK now onto the five star part of the review. This is the best Thai food I have ever had in Charlotte! Definitely try the soup for two... We got the tom kha chicken coconut soup. It is served in this amazing bowl with a flame in the middle. It's a little bit more sour than the soup is in other places, but still delicious. And then I had one of the best pad Thais of my life. Here, they serve it with both shrimp and chicken, and the noodles were uniquely thin. i also like that they included a heap of other fresh vegetables besides bean sprouts...Carrots and cabbage. I just kept going back to it and back to it and back to it!  Insider tip:  Parking on the street is pretty plentiful near there, and there is a parking garage right next-door.",

For dinner, I always get the same thing - chicken fried rice. This time, I added a little extra spice and I will be doing that from now on!  The chicken friend rice is a huge portion of fresh rice with vegetables and really good chicken. The dish comes garnished with additional vegetables that I always mix in - it's really good this way. The portion is huge, and even though I was really hungry I got some to go. The chicken fried rice is really good leftover.   Our service was excellent!

When asked the manger said we decide it and industry standard is 25% which to me is a lie and we are charging you only 18. Been there in past and wasn't charged. As consumer with party of 4 I have no compulsion to pay 18% tip (let me decide how much I want to tip)unless it's service charge which restaurant has to pay taxes on and bills to all. They say they may charge 18% which to me is They profile people and charge 18% to few which in today's world racist and illegal. Tried to explain manager and was rude stating and said we decide it's our call. Besides all these if food is great  I usually don't care but not at this place.  I would strongly suggest you pass especially if you are a person with color. Save your self esteem",

I had the eggrolls as an appetizer (they are AMAZING, but semi small portion so order a few if you're sharing) and then the vegetable delight with tofu for dinner. Everything was delicious and fresh. It totally hit the spot!  I will definitely be returning and think you should too!",

    "text": "Basil isn't bad, just a place where you won't really find me as it's not my sort of scene. I came here on a Thursday night as thai was in people's taste. I think I can be a fan of this place, but still for the price of the food and the quality I felt as if it was 3.5 and service was good so 4 is fair.  Basil is located at street level and basically when you step in you get a feeling of high class mixed with a casual feel. You will see people who are dressed up, but then you see some people wearing flip flops and jeans... So there's not a strict rule on what you can or cannot wear. The ambiance though does feel a little more high class.  So what did I order? I got the three flavored fish. It was alright. I felt as it tended to lean on the sweeter side. There were hints of the kick of spices, so the description is correct. Mild. I think when I eat three flavored fish there should be more of a kick, but not too overpowering that it takes away from the dish. The fish was cooked/fried well so I can't complain too much. I'm not a huge fan of Basil because the prices are a little outrageous, but what can you say considering it's in prime downtown location. Everything is going to be a little pricey.  Basil isn't bad for what it is. Food: 3.5, and service rounds up to a 4. I don't know if I'll be back, but if I do I'll try something else on the menu.",

I then waited an additional 15 minutes and was handed my single order of chicken fried rice at 1 pm. When I asked to speak to the manager her explanation was that the people dining in take precedence over the to-go orders. Poor service and poor response to a valid customer complaint. Oh and not to mention the meal cost of $15 with tax. I expect more if I'm paying that much for a lunch meal. I was one of 3 people who were sitting waiting an excess amount to get my to go order. The other customers didn't appear too pleased about the wait either.",

And today I got to see it first hand.   If you are such a miserable person that doesn't care about his customers then please get out of the hospitality business.   Don't waste your money here - go support a local business that is grateful for your time and money.  When we walked into to get a table there was some miscommunication in our group of how many people were coming. The hostess explained that whole party had to be there (which I totally understand during peak lunch hours) so we confirmed the number and that our whole party was there. Then Mr. Manager rolls over to be a complete train wreck of hostility. It's like he literally wanted to pick a fight a fight with us cause he is such a sad person. After confirming 3 plus times to him (at which point he was rather rude and short) a person in our group got fed up and said we were leaving.  It is really sad that he took the time during lunch rush to talk to prospective customers like this. The hostess did a great job of respectfully communicating to us and I feel sorry for her having to work with a person like that. We would have be fine and buying lunch there if the manager never came over.",

For dinner I ordered shrimp Pad Thai- you can order any dish on a 1-5 scale of heat intensity. I went with level 3 and then used the spice tray the server brought out to add different spices in the dish. For those (myself included) who aren't super familiar with Thai food, under each menu item is a detailed description of what goes into the dish. Our server had detailed knowledge of the menu and was able to answer any of our questions. Everyone at my table enjoyed their dish.  I recommend Basil to any Thai food lovers in the Charlotte area!",

A couple things to note - they don't make entrees without fish sauce so if you're a strict vegetarian this may not be the right place for you. Their food is also not very spicy- I asked for their level of \"hot\" and my food was still not spicy so get \"Thai hot\" if you like food that leaves you a little sweaty. From the interior the restaurant is classy and intimate.  I had the fresh spring rolls -very average, pad kee maw- delicious but not spicy and a lychee martini - yumm. My noodles were saucier than I'd expected which turned out to be a good surprise. The service was great too !",

    "text": "Much to my dismay, I am updating my previous review simply because of service issues we experienced on more than one occaision.    We are Uptown residents and have received impeccable service from the finest of restaurants to the most low-key dive bars.  Thanksfully in Uptown Charlotte, good service is a standard.  Which made one visit to Basil particularly surprising.    We went on a Saturday night after previously making reservations.  From the start it was obvious our server was much more concerned about the large party seated next to use rather than our table of two.  Whlie understandable, the service declined as the night went on.  He forgot drinks, put in an appetizer so late it actually came out after the food arrived, and made our presence in his section seem like a major inconvenience to him.  On this occaision we asked for our check (it arrived 20 minutes later), tipped the 15%, and left.  For future diners, this particular server was an older gentleman with a pony tail, avoid at all costs (especially if his section is \"busy').   Our next visit was again on a Saturday with a few friends of ours visiting from South Charlotte.  They had never tried Thai food and we knew Basil was the perfect place to get them started.  Bad decision on our part, we neglected to make a reservation on a Saturday night.  However, a wait was not a big deal to us because of the fabulous drink menu.  Our plan was to arrive, put on our name on the list, and the move to the bar for basil rolls and martinis.   Clearly, this was not the case.  Upon arriving the hostess was very short with us, informing the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  She made no effort to seat us at the bar or offer any accomdations while we waited.  To move us along even more quickly, she spoke to the people behind me once she was \"finished\" speaking with us...while I was still standing there.  We left and decided on Roosters, which was delicious with impeccable service as usual.    We still love Basil, but will be ordering takeout from now on.",

The restaurant is pleasantly decorated and very light with small Asian touches that say \"yeah, I'm in a Thai restaurant but I'm not in Thailand.\"  Sunday was half price wine night which was great for our group as we settled on a couple bottles.  I order the \"Basil\" Beef.  It was served with a large pot of white rice.  The Basil entree comes with basil, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and thai chili sauce.  It was very very good.  It had loads of flavor.  For me I tasted the basil first, then the garlic, then a nice amount of lingering heat.  I thought that $15 was a bit much for the amount of food that I got but you could have as much rice as you wanted so I was definitely full at the end of the meal.  Our service was very good.  Our waitress was friendly and playful without being overbearing.  I would definitely return to Basil the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

I've gotten it every time I came after it was recommended by many of my friends and it was delicious (loaded with shrimp and chicken). Be sure to request the spice rack on the side, which comes with chili powder, jalapenos and some sort of salsa (extremely spicy). In terms of ambiance, I ate outside the two times I didn't do take-out and it was very spacious/comfortable. The wait staff was friendly and the menu is full of options although a little pricey. Definitely recommend visiting for a relaxing environment and great food.",

We asked to be seated and were told it was their policy not to seat customers until the entire party arrived.  The restaurant was completely empty, with around 12 waiters milling around with nothing to do.  I asked to see a manager, who came out and reiterated that the owner's policy could not be deviated from, regardless of how many people were seated in the restaurant.  Well, we really had some things we needed to discuss, and I had no intention of waiting in their tiny waiting area and trying to have our discussion there, so we left.  With so many restaurant choices in Charlotte, I tend not to give places a second chance.",

The only reason I am giving this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are quite pricey - especially for lunch.  I have tried the basil rolls, pad see-eu, and masaman curry, and all have been outstanding. While I do not usually get tofu, theirs is delicious, and so I always choose tofu instead of meat at Basil.  Portions are large enough that you will likely have enough for leftovers.  You can expect a wait for lunch if you arrive after noon, so I recommend going a little earlier.  Service is extremely fast, though, and always attentive.  If you like Thai food, I highly recommend Basil!  Just come prepared to spend a few dollars more than other places.",

Very clear distinction on the menu of what's spicy and what isn't, so you need not worry about if if that's a concern. I may stop back in for another try next time I'm in town.

When I sat down I noticed that my plate was dirty, but I didn't say anything because I wrote it off as no big deal. I ordered a glass of wine (their Riesling, which I must admit was good); however, I noticed a black speck in my glass which again I ignored. I ordered the pad Thai, and when my food arrived, I was excited. That quickly ended when I realized I was chewing on about 4 inches of plastic. This, I could not ignore. I showed my server, who immediately called the manager. The manager explained that the noodles are weighed and wrapped in plastic, and the plastic must have snapped and fell while the noodles were being cooked. I said understood, and a second dish was brought. When my check came, I was neither compensated, or discounted for my meal. I asked the manager about the pricing, and she said \"well we recooked your food, and it seemed like you enjoyed it\" so there would not be any compensation. Although I understand that the meal was recooked, the fact that I had to chew and spit out plastic while eating my meal deserves some kind of compensation. The lack of customer service left me to leave two stars. Hopefully they will be more considerate in the future.",

    "text": "The dinner group met here this week to get Thai'd up!    My first impression of this place didn't start out that well.  I called a day before to make reservations for a group of 11 people.  The hostess informed me that I had to leave a credit card for the reservation and that if we were late by 15 minutes or anyone in our party cancelled, the card would be charged $25 per person.  Ouch.  I understand the policy because restaurants count on the revenue of a large group and they often get cancellations but I would have like to have read about this policy on their website first to be prepared instead of being shocked when I called.  But oh well, thankfully, all of my group attended so I didn't get charged.  A few of our party ordered appetizers.  Some of the flavors were lacking here and the size of the appetizers were small for the prices.  Other area thai places give you larger portions at the same price or cheaper.  When I try a Thai place for the first time. I usually go with the Basil chicken entree because I feel it's a good representation of a Thai dish without going for Pad Thai so I had the Basil Chicken here, thai spicy!  The meal was flavorful and presented nicely.  The spice level was decent and left my lips tingling after I was finished. I think I could have handled a little more heat though.  The service was excellent here except for a couple of errors with the individual checks but that happens.  Interesting to note that Grey Goose is the house vodka here.    I think this could have been a 5-star experience if it weren't for the reservation policy, however.  I would come back as a walk-in but the reservation policy will probably prevent me from bringing a group here in the event someone does not show up.",

I have to recommend the Pad Thai. The old place I used to frequent for this dish had closed and I have grown to like Basils Pad Thai just as much now.

However, once we ordered and received our dinner order, we had not received the wine. Our waitress forgot about it and unfortunately, none of the other staff on hand remembered (including the bartender).  The Hubs let me know that the serving size of my dish, Pad Woon Sen, was the same as the lunch portion. As I was paying more, I expected a larger serving portion to share.  The dish had just enough heat for my liking but the shrimp portion (extra cost) was lacking.  I will say that the wine we selected went very well with the chocolate mousse cake we shared for dessert!

I have eaten at other Thai restaurants with better tasting food, better prices on the dishes and that were fly-free  We went on a Monday evening, and although it took a few minutes for one of the two hostess' to acknowledge us, we were seated almost immediately.  After we sat, I noticed a fly (I don't know what type, maybe a fruit fly), and swatted it away.  I asked our server what drink was the strongest and sweetest. She said that ALL of their drinks were strong. So, I chose the lychee martini- it was not that sweet, nor was it that strong.   We ordered stuffed shrimp as an appetizer, and the masaman chicken and mixed seafood entrees.  The stuffed shrimp tasted ok, but for $10.95, the portion was barely enough for one person. While eating the shrimp, I began swatting away more flies than I care to mention.  The entrees came out, and everything looked and smelled great. The masaman chicken dish was tasty. The mixed seafood dish was ok (mixed seafood equals approximately 4 mussels, 3-4 shrimp, 3-4 scallops, pieces of calamari(?), and a lot of green peppers, red peppers and onions. I don't believe it was worth the money, but oh well. Also, the calamari (or calamari-like product) that was used in that dish, however, was unlike any calamari I have ever eaten. It was not good.  I could probably overlook everything else BUT my biggest issue was that I could not finish the meal in the restaurant because I was too busy swatting at all of the flies.  I was annoyed and grossed out. My husband saw that I was annoyed and asked for the food to be packed up, so we could leave. Which is what we did, promptly paid and left!  So, Service: Ok. Food: Ok. Drinks: Weak. Prices: High. Flies: Nasty. Return Visit: Not ever!",

But they forgot our rolls completely. So we just cancelled it because my Pad Thai came out first and when we asked about the rolls, the server admitted that she forgot about it.  Anyhow, I still say it's okay because their food is good. I guess that's how they stay open. I'm not Thai so I don't know if it's authentic - and from my experience with Thai food during honeymoon, I don't know if I want authentic Thai food - but it's good. This was my fifth visit and am still happy with their food. Just wish they would make their lunch experience as good as their dinner/banquets.  The first time I went there was for a get-together between locals who work in the same field. I had a great time. The group happy hour place downstairs was cozy and the rolls were great.

We went for dinner and in Charleston the lunch portion is more than the Charlotte dinner portions.  I ordered the jalapeno mule and it was one of the worst drinks I have ever had.  The waitress acted like she didn't want to be there and my water was empty for most of the trip.  Sad to say Basil will have to stay a Charleston only tradition.",

Got the Pad Thai, which was solid. However, it ended up being at least 16.95 (if my memory is correct) and the portion was pretty tiny for that price.   Ordered the Thai spring rolls, which were $7-8 and only came with two rolls. Just two for that price! They were good but not that good.   I have been to better Thai restaurants where you get much more bang for your buck, in terms of quality and price. The food here is solid but not worth the price and small portions.  Service was fine, ambience is cool also.   Nice to see what all the hype was about, but I would not go back.",

I was expecting way better food based on the reviews. The food is OK, I would have given it 3 stars if it was priced around $7-9 for an entree but it's double that.  So I continue looking for the Thai spot that leaves us full, smiling and looking forward to going back. I think I'll try some more of the less trendy Thai spots in hopes of better food.  P.S. Note to the hostess: You should try \"Hello, welcome to Basil, party of 4?\" instead of staring blankly. Sheesh, clueless and rude.",

You'll end up paying $16-$17 with tip for lunch (but it's so worth it as a treat).  If I had the money, I would eat there every day :)  The only dish I've ordered is the Basil, however, I've ordered it with chicken, tofu and beef and all have been fantastic.  I like it so much that I don't want to order something different and be disappointed.    If you go for lunch, make sure to show up a little before noon in order to get a table.

Within walking distance from all of Uptown's attractions, the location of this restaurant is ideal if you like that feel; however, finding parking can be a pain, but that's the price you pay with any large downtown city area.

The second...  The iced tea mojitas are dangerously good!    We are fortunate enough to know someone who lives within walking distance, so we hoofed it over to Basil, so the unfortunate task of attempting to park uptown was not for us that night!!   We had a reservation which we were early for, meaning we were crammed into a very small waiting area until our table was ready.    The waiter was very nice, although not incredibly knowledgeable about liquors that are stocked and asked if we still needed the wine list after we had all gotten our cocktails.  Just silly I say ;)  The meal was quite tasty, about par for Thai food, however the price was pricey pricey!  For two people you're looking at close to 100 bucks including tips and two cocktails.    The atmosphere is swanky uptown type and of contemporary design.   I'd give it a four if I felt that the price was moderate, but I'm holding True to my guns and giving it a solid 3 stars.

However, this place is not consistent. If you go for lunch versus dinner, you get a totally different experience. The appetizers like the wings and wontons are ever changing and never tastes the same. And never EVER order take-out. If they manage to cook your food the way you ordered it (which they messed up on last night, I ordered the pad thai - \"thai hot\" which is the hottest it gets, and there was nary a spice to be seen, it was plain old noodles that tasted worse than Ramen). It seems like they put very little effort in their take-out orders, they should really discontinue and be dine-in only. So all in all, I reallly do love this place I will just be sure to dine in from now on.",

Great hip, trendy vibe most of the patrons were in suits. My husband & I were accompanied my our 8 year old son & his friend. They shared chicken fried rice add broccoli $10.95, one of the best we've had, one order was plenty for them to share. We started with the Basil Rolls $5.95, small portion but fresh & flavorful served with a Thai chili dipping sauce, I missed the typical peanut sauce but it was still yummy.  Our well educated server suggested the fried won tons $5.95, the kids fought over them. Stuffed with chicken, shrimp and cream cheese and served with a sweet and sour sauce. My husband ordered his usually, Masaman Chicken $10.95, he thought was it very good.  I trusted my fellow YELP!ers and went with the chef's signature dish, Crispy Red Curry Duck $22.95 and worth every penny! It was crispy duck without being fatty or greasy. It had heat without slapping me and the flavor was unique and satiating. The veggies were the perfect accompaniment.  For dessert my son picked their last piece of tuxedo cake and his friend ordered the coconut ice cream. Both were delicious and we fought over the last bite.  The prices were high but fair. I dream of an excuse to go back...",

The server was good and so was our mood and appetite while we ordered our food- what followed was very unexpected. Two of the three main dishes that came were not our orders- the server was apologetic and quickly went to replace. Only this time someone else bought wrong dishes again! At this point we were hungry and upset- so the server called the manager (who was apparently the owner). The owner was the most ungracious host ever- he just didn't know what to do. Finally our dish came- and it was right this time. The story doesn't end here...when the bill finally came, I was lucky enough to check the bill and saw that the owner had charged us for all the 3 wrong dishes- Seriously!!!!. Thinking that it was a mistake I asked for him to correct it. He took 20 minutes to sort it out between him and server and then ran our card for the twice the amount of the bill- again I was lucky enough to check this. Now we were all very furious- were they seriously so dumb to make so many mistakes in one night or were they deliberately trying to leech us? I don't know and I don;t want to know but I do want to warn all the future customers of Basil to check and recheck their bills before they sign it off.",

It is very easy to get to if you're staying uptown or will be headed to the museum or theater.  Inside it is clean and tidy, with very clean architectural lines to it with the obligatory asian twist.  Very calm feeling, and there was music on that was chill and upbeat at the same time.  We had the larb (beef salad) as an appetizer, Basil duck and red curry chicken.  The duck was very flavorful, but a tad dry.  The red curry was very good and very spicy.  As big Thai food fans, there are plenty of items on the menu that we would like to try!  The service was okay.

I always drive past it and from the outside..it just looks like another Thai place that might be mistaken for a Chinese/Japanese restaurant. However, as soon as we walked in we were very surprized and impressed with the decor and that they were packed..on a Wed. night!  Our gift certificate had expired 2 weeks ago (I can't understand why a gift certifcate would expire).  The hostess at the desk didn't look like we were going to wiggle our way out of this one.  She called over the manager, Dillon, and he looked at the gift certifcate and said they would honor it and then thanked us for our donation to the JDRF.  Dillon seated us and took our drink order.  Hendrick Gin & Tonics - yes they had Hendricks AND they had cucumbers and didn't look at us strangely when we asked.  A+ already.  We started off with the Basil spring rolls.  They were very good and the dipping suace was very spicy, but you only got 2 of them for $6.95.  I thought that was a little pricey and I would have rather gone for the lettuce wraps. Dillon was very attentive and we had a great discussion about how the Uptown hotel market has been full for weeks and is booked until Thanksgiving.  He also made an excellent recommendation for a Pinot Noir and it wasn't the most expensive wine on the list.  For dinner, Jennifer our waitress was very helpful.  She said she liked the red curry dishes the best and suggested the Red Curry Duck  ($24.95).  We ordered the duck and the Pad Thai ($15.95).  The Red Curry Duck was awesome.  The Pad Thai had chicken and shrimp and it was very good.  One of the best Pad Thai I have had in awhile.  It did not stick together like a big wad of starchy noodles.  It was very good with enough of a helping of chicken and large size shrimp and a good amount of vegetables.  After dinner we went to the bar and finished our wine and had a rum mojito that was also very good.  The bar tender was personable and Dillon came over to check on us.  It was a great night and the food was superb.  Will definetly go back to Basil Thai.",

We could have been seated sooner at the chef's bar which gives you a bird's eye view of the kitchen.  Our server arrived and took our drink orders and gave us a couple of minutes to look over the menu.  When he came back we both ordered the Pad Thai.  I asked him if they had a scale for the spiciness.  He explained the Pad Thai had no spices, but their scale was mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot.  Unless you know to ask you would get the mild.  We both ordered hot.  Our food came out pretty quickly and looked good.  The one thing I noticed though, was there were no peanuts on either order.  The food was steaming hot.  The flavor was OK, but nothing special.  I felt a little burn from the heat, but I definitely would order the Thai hot next time.  Overall our lunch was good as was the service, but the prices here are a little higher than other Thai places.  Unless I have a craving for Thai when I'm working downtown, I probably would go to a different Thai restaurant.",

The decor of the restaurant is very nice.  I love how they mix non-kitschy Thai elements with modern decorations, but it never feels impersonal.  The service was really attentive, but not too attentive.  If anything, the restaurant was a bit chilly, but maybe it's cause I was just wearing a t-shirt and shorts.  But still, it was the middle of summer.  The food itself was pretty great.  We came during restaurant week, so we got 3-course meals with glasses of wine, which was sweet.  The stuffed shrimp was ok, the Yum Yee salad was amazing, and my red curry dish was amazing but really way too spicy for me.  I was probably also cold because of all the water I was drinking.  Anyways, definitely give this a try, although it's a bit pricey so maybe come here for lunch?",

I have only had Thai a few times and I was pleasantly surprised with the food.  We had the wontons, Tom Cha Gai, and I had the Pad See-Eu with Beef and the friend had Pad Thai.  The online menu is a little misleading as it doesn't like the option to add protein but in restaurant you will see the protein options and upcharge.  I would say the prices are a little higher than other Thai places I have eaten, as other reviewers have commented on as well. Street parking was easy at this location on a Tuesday.  You can't park on the street from 4pm until 6pm but after that it is free. The restaurant also has a nice wine selection.",

At first I thought the orchid had smudged the edge of the glass but as I inspected it further it became clear that the smudge was someone else's lipstick.    I sent it back and the manager came over to apologize and let me know that it would be a few minutes before I would get my drink back because they had to wash my glass and then let the glass cool down before re- pouring the beverage.  It made me wonder- did they only have one martini glass?  And were they not going to pour me a fresh drink?  A few minutes later my frou-frou beverage came back in a juice style glass, with a seemingly larger pour... This totally lost it's appeal and I left it on the table...  They did not comp that drink, and I would be concerned that all dishes and serving pieces received the same lax treatment in the kitchen.  Your choice, of course... but to me the risk/reward of eating here is not acceptable.",

That was nice because we were all dressed up to go to a lounge afterwards. Not everyone at the table was eating so we received our food pretty quickly. Everything was tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food. No one ordered any type of standout dish. I had the pad thai. Pretty standard across most Thai places.  Our waitress was a bit inattentive at one point even forgetting to bring us an alcoholic drink we ordered. Then said that they were out of it which was annoying because she should have relayed that to us when she found out. But that to the side someone who appeared to be the manager was very nice and bought out the cake with candles so that we could sing happy birthday and then took it back and sliced it and boxed the remains. That was very nice as some places will attempt to charge a cake cutting fee for that.   All in all a great place to get Thai food and I would definitely return.",

    "text": "We were walking around uptown Charlotte and we were craving Thai food and all of a sudden we saw Basil Thai Cuisine! So we go in and we are quickly seated towards the back with a perfect view of the restaurant and kitchen expediting area. The manager/owner came over to greet us and provide menus, after some small talk about how slow they expected to be, he went away and our server approached. We ordered a Mac Allan 12 and a cucumber martini along with an appetizer:  NAM SOD (CHICKEN) Minced meat mixed with ginger, scallions, cilantro, onions, peanuts, chili powder, fish sauce and lemon juice. Served with a wedge of Iceberg lettuce. $8.50   The appetizer flew out of the kitchen and it was delicious! Great flavor and the fish sauce was not overwhelming. Unfortunately, while the Nam Sod was great, our drinks took almost 12 minutes to arrive! When our drinks arrived we ordered dinner:  For the gentleman: MASAMAN CURRY Potatoes, onions and cashew nuts. $16.95   For the lady: PAD THAI (CHICKEN)  Rice noodles stir-fried with chicken, shrimp, eggs, bean sprouts, scallions, peanuts and Pad Thai sauce. Served with a wedge of lime. (The National dish of Thailand) $17.95   Their website stares \"Thai food refined\" so I expected to wait a little longer than you would in a more traditional hole in the wall Thai restaurant, but holy smokes we waited sooo long, and our server vanished! I watched the food runners aimlessly wonder in circles around the restaurant trying to match the food in their hand with the right table. Finally our server showed up with a bowl of steamed white rice, not brown like I ordered, and said our food was coming right up. 5 long minutes later our food did arrive. The food was very, very good although I did order my MASAMAN hot and they didn't deliver, it was as mild as it gets... fortunately the quality and flavor were divine!  Overall, 3 stars for food, 1 star for slow inattentive service on an admittedly slow night with a full staff?? Good food maybe not worth the wait...",

They said it's policy to not seat until whole party is there because they fill up fast.  The place never filled up and we had our other party's order.   We then tried to order 2 pad thai's without egg ( menu stated up to two menu modifications) due to vegan diet and they said no they couldn't do it due to owner wanting to get orders out under 9 minutes. This modification would impact their 9 minute food delivery to table.  Again, the restaurant was not filled up.    I guess table turn over is more important.  We left and went to Cowbell and had a great time with great service.",

Basil Thai's got your back! (And gut.)  Dinner at Basil Thai is a much classier place than the hole-in-walls that I'm used to dining at, and the food shows it. On a cold Charlotte night, there's nothing better than a bowl of chicken coconut soup and we were able to split the tureen between four of us girls. We also ordered the pad thai, pad kee mao, and the crispy red curry duck. The pad thai noodles were perfectly springy, and I would gladly eat a whole plate by myself if we hadn't decided to do family style. Personally, I wasn't sold on the crispy duck; if you let it sit for more than a minute, the curry sauce will automatically make your duck rather un-crispy. Still, the curry worked well when mixed in with white rice.   Verdict: if you're looking for a great Thai place, then bingo! You've found one here at Basil Thai.",

There was a group of nine of us - we had a pretty busy day so we called to see if we could move our reservation time by a half hour, which they graciously did for us.  On top of that we were running late even a half hour behind that, yet they their customer service was still perfectly friendly.  I order the pad see-u was paired with a pineapple Mojito, and was in heaven.  You get a big portion of food for the money you pay and I would recommend getting the assorted Thia food platter.

The Seafood medley with mussels, scallops fish and shrimp was served in a super tasty broth with vegetables and peppers..  Hmm I just realized Tai folks aren't into sopping up their food with bread .. I digress lol. But the rice served that purpose. Tonight slightly el dente. After picking through the seafood elements and julienned carrots there were a lot of nearly raw bell peppers which I'm not a great fan of. Next time I will try the crispy duck. I'm just trying to order something other than the chicken and shrimp pad tai, of which I can't get enough. Great atmosphere and friendly hard working server. Poor lady had 7 tables but she worked it with a smile!  Apparently they had just sent a lot of wait staff home when in came a big rush. Bummer Uptown location's valet is 5$ on top of a $56.00 meal with appy for 2 which includes no cocktails.",

    "text": "Basil is the epitome of a Thai restaurant turned hipster. When most people think of an Asian restaurant in the United States, styrofoam containers, family members running around in the kitchen, and a strange name (\"A-Plus Happy China\") come to mind. Basil has none of these, although I didn't do a thorough scan of the kitchen staff.   The food is the real reason you'll come to Basil. While the atmosphere is swanky, you can quench your thirst for said decor by visiting any number of other Uptown Charlotte restaurants (5Church, for example). It's a challenge for two people to have a well-rounded meal under $100, which makes me question why the valet parking isn't free.  Don't leave this place without trying the Tom Kha Gai soup. Seriously. The BEST soup I have ever tasted. Creamy, slightly sweet coconut soup with chicken and herbs. Incredible.  The curry duck was very good, with only a few bones to fumble around with. The sauce was not too spicy, with just a gentle \"kick\" at the right moment, when you'd expect it. Jasmine rice sops up the remainder and cleans your plate in the process. Worth $26? No way, but if I want duck, I'd rather a restaurant do the messy work than try to fumble around with cooking it at home.   Service was pretty good--again, you come here for the food. Just be prepared to shell out some cash for it.",

I opted for the Pad Prik with tofu--a combination of seasonal vegetables, herbs and garlic over simple jasmine rice. It was really good--the only reason I didn't finish the whole thing is because I had something to eat before heading to the restaurant. Had I not, I would have finished the whole thing.  The Basil Thai (I think that's the name) is an exquisite martini--I would've polished off two of them but I restrained myself. You should definitely check this place out.

My first interaction with the hostess was not very pleasurable, I went into the restaurant at 1120a and they didn't open till 1130a. Gasp. I wanted to sit down, grab a glass of wine and read Creative Loafing and wait for my girlfriend.  Let me just say I was denied access.    I know I have a lot of nerve showing up so early and before anyone explains to me the inner workings of a restaurant, I supported myself, full time, non-stop as a waitress for twenty years.  Let's just say good thing the food was delicious or I would have not been back.  Finally when the hostess saw fit to sit the now three tables at the door, she walked me to my table.    I sat down and ordered a glass of Prosecco, it came a little flat, I thought,  BOOOOO, but I couldn't complain, it would just be in bad form.  I drank my flat sparkling, I have had worse.  We started with basil rolls and chicken Larb.  The basil rolls were fresh and the dipping sauce was the perfect sweetness with a tiny kick of spicy chile paste.  I have only had Chicken Larb served chilled like a salad, this Larb,  the chicken was freshly cooked and served room temperature. Larb is usually a meat concoction of mint leaves, chili, onion, rice powder in lime juice and fish sauce.  We also shared some chicken red curry, it was great, how can you go wrong with coconut milk and red curry?     My second visit I went at a more suitable hour of 1p, so I didn't get any lip from the hostess.  We had basil rolls again, shrimp fried in egg roll wrappers and Pad Thai, everything is fresh and the heat index is perfect, you can ask for chili sauce and make dishes as spicy as you like.  I love this restaurant, I think I would go on off hours or weeknights or expect a wait, the restaurant only sits about 75 people. It is priced reasonable at lunch, with a bottle of wine our bill for two was $60, half of that was the wine.  If you haven't eaten Thai food, I would recommend going with two or more people so you can order a lot of food and try a lot of different items.  So far, everything I have had has been off the charts fresh and scrumptious.  I feel like everyone is allowed to have a bad day, maybe I could make sure I am really nice next time I go in there, maybe she won't remember me as that customer that came in too early.  I would rather be known as that lady who drinks at 1132a.  Basil Thai gets a 3 corndog rating.",

Made for an unfortunate evening for us. After placing our appetizer order, we had a long wait. Finally the appetizers were delivered, but shortly thereafter the main entrees arrived. We could have accepted this, if the waitress would have been more pleasant. While we loved the food, as visitors with so many choices in Charlotte, we probably won't rush back to this establishment. Not the first time service has clouded a restaurant experience. Most of the time, we just forget the place and never return.",

Of course the hair did come with a free refill after I had already eaten.",

    "text": "A friend recently recommended Basil for lunch and I gladly obliged. I enjoy sampling Thai food from various restaurants, and try to go to a few whenever I travel. On the positive side, Basil is a first class establishment. Decent menu selections, very nice decor and layout, and an option to eat outside when the weather permits. The location for downtown Charlotte is nearly ideal off Tryon Street adjacent to a church. The first thing I noticed on the menu is that the soups (with one exception being Tom Kha Gai) are not available in a \"cup\" size, which is ideal during the lunch hour. I do not understand why, but if you order soup, you are getting the \"bowl\" size and that will cost you about $9.00. I am not kidding. Thai soups are some of the best, and to make this an \"all in or nothing\" option is not a good business strategy especially for lunch. Most of the menu items are priced very high for lunch. $10 to $12 was the average entree price which appears to be borderline excessive. More on that later.   The quality of the food is very good to excellent. I ordered beef and cashews with white rice five stars hot. The beef was served in a brown sauce & vegetables with a large bowl of rice on the side. The beef was very tender and you could easily cut it with the side of a fork. The jasmine rice was perfectly cooked and more than enough to round out my entree. In fact, I only used about half of the bowl. This was my second visit to a Thai restaurant in Charlotte, and I am close to deciding that the locals of Charlotte do not typically enjoy traditional Thai-level spices. I realize that it is a matter of personal choice, but patrons deserve the option just the same. My five star hot entree would be closer to 1.5 to 2-stars back home. Thai-level spiciness is an acquired taste, but when you become accustomed to it, you are somehow locked into it....Ok, that is not particularly well stated, but trust me, the hotter the spices, the more the flavors will emerge. For those initiated with spicy Cajun entrees in South Louisiana, you will understand this (poor) general description more easily.  Back to the pricing. My entree was easily a \"dinner\" size portion from my South Florida Thai haunts. So, I am going to temper my statement about the pricing to note that the quantity of food makes it a better value than I initially indicated. However, I do miss the daily house soup and spring rolls that diners typically receive in most other Thai restaurants for lunch. I also miss the $7.95 lunch cost too.  By the way, our service was excellent. The waitress took our order quickly and checked back to make sure that everything was fine. She was also very knowledgeable of the menu, and offered some suggestions about other entrees that I will note for a future visit. She clearly was well trained, smiled often, and thanked us for our business. Those are traits in which you cannot teach.  In summary, I enjoyed Basil and would recommend it. It is not one of those shopping center atmosphere hole-in-the-wall places, but rather a nice downtown location. The restaurant offers a full bar, and I am sure that sometime after 5:00 PM I will stop back and supplement my review with an evening evaluation. Until then...  Cheers !",

    "text": "I love Thai food and was happy to hear that Charlotte was getting a modern, upscale Thai restaurant.  Don't get me wrong.  \"Regular\" Thai is awesome, but I love modern decor and a modern twist on ethnic foods.    I called at 1:00 p.m. to make reservations.  There was no answer and I got their voicemail which told their address, hours, etc.  Finally, at the end, it said that if you're calling to make a reservation, leave your name, number, party size, requested time, etc.  I didn't receive a phone call back until 3:30 p.m. advising that my requested 8:00 p.m. time wasn't available, but 7:30 could be accommodated.  Of course, I didn't get this message until 6:30 because I was at work and my cell phone was off.  I called and 7:30 was no longer an option either, but 8:30 was...if I didn't mind a \"tight\" table. I was a bit leary, but took the reservation anyway.  At this point, I was unsure about even going because first impressions are a big deal to me.  We decided to go with it and showed up around 8:20 to a restaurant that was 75% full and were immediately seated.  Apparently, Basil is trying to sound busier than they are.  I don't particularly care for those kinds of games, but I was glad that we were seated right away.  And our \"tight\" table was a high-top in the bar area with the next table about three feet away.  Thankfully, \"tight\" was an exaggeration, as I've been sat in much, much worse.  It was a great table to me, and I enjoyed the soothing atmosphere, low-lighting, and modern decor in the restaurant.  The only thing a little off-putting was the temperature.  We came in from 90-something degree weather (and walking around Uptown waiting for our 8:30 reservation) and expected to be immediately cooled down.  It never happened.  I don't know if the a/c was malfunctioning or they were trying to save money, but I thought it detracted a bit from the upscale atmosphere they were trying to convey.  Anyway...onto the food and all the good stuff.  We're at Basil, so of course we had to try the Fresh Basil Rolls.  I love these unfried \"summer rolls.\"  I could eat an entire dinner of them.  They're cool, refreshing, flavorful, and you feel so healthy eating them.  I usually order them at any Thai or Vietnamese restaurant I go to because they're always so delicious.  And they were delicious here, too, although about half the size I'm used to.  The dipping sauce was terrifically sweet and spicy.    Their entrees were typical Thai dishes.  There wasn't anything modern or upscale about them, like I was expecting.  Nonetheless, they had a lot of flavor to them.  I tried (what else?) the Basil.  It was chicken served with peppers, onions, garlic covered in a spicy Thai chili sauce, served with white rice on the side.  YUM.  The entree size was enough for one hungry eater or for dinner and a next-day lunch for a light eater.    All in all, it was an enjoyable dining experience, but I'd like them to work out the kinks with the reservation system, A/C, size of the basil rolls, and adding some modern touches to some traditional Thai menu items.",

There were some very good things about our visit.  -Food came quickly and was tasty. -Water was refilled promptly and consistently. -We received a tasty, complimentary birthday dessert   One thing really made me angry, though. Our server recommended an appetizer platter, which is not on the menu. Turns out, it doesn't exist, and they just charge you for each each of the appetizers individually. Turned out to be a $42 appetizer platter. Yes, we should have asked, but it felt a little shady. It really soured me on the whole place.   There were some other things I didn't care for, either--overall pricing is a bit high, servers didn't bring new plates or utensils for entree after we used them for appetizers, portions seemed smaller than I remembered, table/seating was uncomfortable--but that one really topped the list and made me look at everything else in a more negative light. I can't recommend Basil after that experience.",

The food was pretty good but definitely not worth the higher price. The fried wontons were bite sized, though good. My mouth watered for the Pad Thai, but after opening the lid, I was disappointed with the lack of sauce. All the Pad Thai I've eaten always has a delicious sauce with it.

I tried a few local favorites but I was never impressed. In comes Basil...   The atmosphere is chic and modern and the restaurant is well appointed. I'm happy that they added valet service and a bit of outdoor seating - always helpful for local peeps to drop by. As I mentioned before, I positively crave their Pad Thai and always ask them to make mine spicy, but not Thai hot - I'd like to keep my taste buds intact. As for their other dishes, I've thoroughly enjoyed their Pad See Eu, Pad Woon Sen, Basil Chicken and beef satay. The portions are fairly large - but not massive Maggiano's style.   The service has always been top notch here - the one time that we waited at our table 10+ minutes before a waiter got around to us they kindly sent a free dessert our way. Said dessert was fried ice cream - not my personal favorite, but I appreciated the sentiment. Definitely give Basil a try if you're looking for delicious, upscale Thai fare in the QC. Oh - and for those of you who travel to the coast - Basil has another location in Charleston and is opening a new location in Mt. Pleasant (also SC) in the fall of 2010!",

Then, when he did show up, his opening line was, \"What can I do for you?\"  Stop with the dumb questions!  We're here for dinner... in case you forgot, you're supposed to make our dining experience pleasant.    The bad service was counterbalanced by the GREAT food.   Tom Kha Gai - perfect  Green Curry - just the right balance between the sweetness of the coconut milk with spicy heat.  Creme Brulee - all three flavors were great.  They came in a three small dishes.  I think the flavors were ginger lemon, orange green tea, and cinnamon   Overall:   I love Thai Food, and I've been to other Thai places in the Charlotte area.  This place is okay, but something about the experience made if feel all wrong.  One of the reasons I like going to Thai places is because they are authentic and usually family owned.  The best thing I can relate it to is going to a mom-and-pop Italian restaurant vs. a trip to the olive garden.    Yes, the decor was \"fancy\" but I don't need to feel like I'm in some dance club to eat good food - it almost ruins the experience in my opinion.   The prices are fairly high and I've found food just as good at other Thai restaurants in the area and their service to be WAY better.  If I'm paying top dollar to eat uptown, the service better be fantastic.    It looked like the other waitstaff had great attitudes and were serving their tables quickly.  Hopefully they'll weed out the guy we had... looks like a couple other people who wrote reviews might have encountered him as well.",

Drinks: basil vodka martinis - tasty  App:  basil rolls & yum yai salad - great, very fresh  Entrees: shrimp green curry & basil tofu - both delicious  Dessert: fried green tea ice cream - yummers!  Overall a great meal in a nice, urban chic environment. Can be on the expensive side but this is not your typical 'hole-in-the-wall' cheap Thai dining. Awesome place to treat yourself and a date.",

I've had the Wonton Soup, Pad Thai and Masaman Curry with Chicken with White Rice. All were very good and convinced me that I like Thai food.. though the soup may have been slightly bland.. I took my sister and her husband there, they also loved it and their huge Thai eaters. My boyfriend had the garlic chicken and that was a very accurate name (HEAVY garlic and chicken).   Service: First time I went there I swore I would never go back. I was there for an hour before I got my food. They were so rude about it. The manager (?) made my skin crawl when he tried to \"appease\" me. I left absolutely furious.   The next time I went was after work. Service was much better. The next I went for take-out, which was fine. And the next was again for lunch. I sat at the bar and had a great experience.   My Recommendation: I can't remember the name of it for my life, but they have a martini there. It's creamy and I think the word Thai is in the name. AMAZING.",

    "text": "My team who is disbursed across the U.S. was headed to Charlotte for an \"All Hands (on Deck)\" off site meeting. This was the first time we were all going to be in the same place at the same time. And the first time many of us were going to be meeting. Manager put together a dinner at Basil Thai and I was skeptical. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE Thai food, but when you have so many different people coming from different walks of life, were they all going to find something they liked? We shall see.   I was there a little early and ran into the only colleague that lives near me (in St. Augustine) and we got a drink in the bar while we waiting for everyone else. I was happy to see a local brew on tap & went for that. As the rest of the party arrived we all said our hellos and were eventually led to our table. Instead of having us order multiples of a bunch of different appetizers, our waitress was kind (and genius) enough to let us know they could put together a sampler platter with four different things to try. Our platters consisted of the Fresh Basil rolls, the Egg Rolls, the Fried Wontons and the Stuffed Shrimp. While I would have personally gone for the Nam Sod, this gave us a nice array of snacks while we got to know each other.   For my entree, I went with the Pad Kee Mow. I asked for spicy, but I should have paid attention when she happened to mention their spice levels were Americanized. Because this was not the medium I was expecting, it was more along the mild spice level. Oh well. The dish overall was good: the noodles were cooked well, the tofu was done in small enough chunks as to not overwhelm and the vegetables were plenty.  Overall a nice restaurant in the heart of downtown and walkable from where I was staying. Can't go wrong with that.",

    "text": "Came here and tried their Tom Aban Talay Soup, Pad Thai, and Som Tum (green Papaya Salad).   The food is about a 3.5 stars but giving it 4 stars because of the service. The mixed seafood soup was probably the best dish. It had tons of strong flavors and a good amount of spice. The shrimp they used were of decent size and was not overcooked. I do think they give too many button mushrooms and they should supplement it with some other ingredients. I think using more scallions would have helped as well.  The pad thai was quite expensive in my opinion and as usual, the chicken was dry. Interestingly to note is that they also included shrimp which was flayed and as a result, became overcooked. Presentation was good and they did give you enough bean sprouts but the flavoring of the noodles was underwhelming. They really need to not hold back on the seasoning/sauce for this dish.  The green papaya salad was alright. Had a play on sweet and sour, mainly sour from the vinegar but there was little to no flavoring of the papaya itself. There is also shrimp halves in this dish but not seasoned at all. I think if they seasoned the shrimp separately, it could have balanced and elevated the dish.  The waiter was really friendly and paid attention to our needs. Water level never went below half and always kept coming back to see how we were doing.    I like the decor and service of this place. In terms of food, it's just good and lots of room for improvement. I'll have to try another thai place in Charlotte to compare but for now, this isn't a bad place to go to.",

Initially experience was good.  We sat down and Shalee was our server.  She is a very good server by the way.  We ordered a chicken coconut soup as an appetizer and then ordered our entrees.  Soup came out within 10 minutes.  However, it took a little over an hour for our entrees to come out, after the soup being brought to our table.  Shalee (server) said the chicken coconut soup will be comped from our bill.  A few minutes later, a manager named \"Michelle\" came to our table and said the soup would not be comped.  She said the time stamps on the tickets were in expected time frames.  Michelle had a very argumentative and condescending attitude towards us.  Keep in mind my parents are in their 60s and my brother and I are in our 30s.  Very disappointed that we were treated this way by Michelle.  Terrible customer service.  Frankly customer service did not exist.  We will not be coming back.  Owner and management need to do something about Michelle.  The way we were treated by her, no paying customer should be treated.",

But it was our couple friends anniversary and they love Thai so we decided to go.   Didn't have to wait for a table since we reached there at 9. Ordered appetizers (rice paper wraps) and they were okay. For the main course, we ordered a few different curries and the sweet n sour. The server seemed pretty competent and well versed with the menu since we have a few dietary restrictions and she was able to advise appropriately.   What happened afterwards was just unreal!   My wife's dish came and she dove right in only to find a few mins later that it had onions in it. She is allergic and we had very specifically requested while placing the order and confirmed it was written down properly. The server took the dish and brought another one back in a few mins. My wife started again and while I was about to take a bite from her dish realized that this dish had onion too! By this time my wife's allergies had taken over. Her head was exploding and she was not doing well. I asked to see the manager who came by and asked what the issue was. After explaining how the order was served wrong twice he goes: \"what would you like me to do about it?\"   Seriously! You are in the service industry and you ask me that question? I was about to lose it if it were for my friends - whose order also had issues btw.   We asked for the check - and guess what? The dish they had made wrong for us was charged for 4 times! Yes - 4 times! So it was their mistake we were gonna pay for.   My wife took over and asked the check to be fixed / and they charged us for two dishes. Well whatever!   The story doesn't end - they actually charged us twice the total amount when they ran the card. And that time - our whole party gave up on this place, the owner and everything! We were just ready to go home.   Seriously people - this place is going to the dumps. Am never taking a client here - what an embarrassment that could be! Save your self some money and trauma.

But my dinner partner always gets something different from the \"entrees\" section and it's always really bad.  Will not be returning.  P.S. WORST fresh rolls ever. ever ever ever. you get 2 tiny finger-sized things for $6 and it makes me mad how not good they are. the dipping sauce makes me mad, too. for the same reason.",

Maybe I'm bias because I'm Asian myself but you get very little for the price you're paying. I got the basil noodle soup, their take on \"pho\". They giving you a small dish of garnishes and I had to request more. By the time I got the second plate of garnishes I'd already ate half of my pho. Of course, it was the peak hour of lunch so I understand. They do give you a variety of chili on the table which I highly appreciated. I'd be back if I'm craving pho since uptown Charlotte doesn't offer any other place.",

They up-charged me $1 for the substitution despite the fact that the red curry and green curry are the same price and the menu contained no language regarding this up-charge. I politely requested they remove the up-charge and the main manager came by and tried to explain why they added it (\"you added two vegetables to the red curry\"). I responded the I merely ordered the green curry but with the red curry sauce, and asked if there was a price difference b/t the two sauces that accounted for the up-charge. \"No, there isn't\", but he persisted with the assessment of the charge. I informed him that this is the third time something like this has occurred at this restaurant and that I'll pay the charge but he's lost my business forever. He said he was fine with that.   That $1 apparently means a lot more to him than it does to me. He's willing to forfeit multiple future sales to keep that $1. That tells you something about his business acumen, or lack thereof. I'll put up with the soup nazi's antics if his soup is worth it. Def not so in the case.",

I was quickly greeted by two friendly bartenders who were quick and responsive throughout the evening and helpful with recommendations to order. I ordered a lychee martini that was PERFECT, and I was given water without even having to ask, major props there.   I ordered egg rolls which came out quickly. They were hot and they had a nice array of spices to add to them. The entree (Prik King) came next and was also very good. Great flavor, fresh vegetables, absolutely no complaints.   The entire restaurant has a very modern vibe, like many of the restaurants in uptown Charlotte. Everything was clean and there was a lot of space (including what appeared to be a very large private room in the back).   My only real complaint (and it isn't a small one) was the price. ALL of the food (appetizers, entrees, etc.) were all VERY over-priced. Entrees were over-priced by $1-2 and the entrees were over-priced by $4-5. It would make me not want to come here again unfortunately because there is just no need for these prices.",

Pictured is the veggie fried rice with no eggs and tofu added. It was delicious.

He described everything perfectly..made recommendations and was really friendly. We had the Larb and the Green Papaya Salad..we opted for the Beef Larb, it was perfect..and the Green Papaya salad was filled with boiled shrimp and peanuts..it was fantastic. Dylan the waiter had said one of his most favorite things was the Spicey Thai fried rice..he said it was sooo good..We ordered the Chicken Spicey Thai Fried Rice..it was just as he said INCREDIBLE!! The night was made even better when Dylan, who was not only wise about the food but also wise about wine came to the table and told me they had opened a bottle of 1995 Beringer Knights Valley CAB..did I want a glass...It was like Velvet chocolate on my tongue..it was fantastic..So I give Basil Thai ..10 points..everything was great about it!!",

Try the pineapple mojito!! And the stuffed shrimp appetizer. Experience both red & green curry (both unique flavors and delicious).

    "text": "So let me preface this with the fact that I had the flu when I went here. So I ordered the Sweet and sour shrimp soup. The soup broth tasted fishy.... I didn't notice because my taste buds are on a hiatus due to the flu but lucky enough for you, I had two friends who tried the soup and gave the fishy remark. I trust them so you can too. We also ordered the Thai spring rolls and A) they were weird tasting (ie: horrible) and B) when we got our check the guy charged us more for them then they were on the menu for. The menu said \"Thai Spring Rolls..... 5.95.\" When we each got our check with the 1/3 Thai spring rolls charged to each of us and we were each charged 2.98. There were only 3 total rolls and I have a hard time believing that they charge $9 for 3 awful spring rolls. The Thai place I go for lunch gives spring rolls for free and they taste way better. I would suggest it if you want mild Americanized Thai food or if you want nice ambiance.   Pros- nice decor, moderate prices on the menu  Cons - so-so Thai food, up selling servers, over charging for spring rolls",

    "text": "I've been to Basil twice. The first time, I went for lunch the second week it was open. I had chicken mussaman curry, which is my favorite thai curry  dish, and thai iced tea.  The thai tea was particularly good and the curry was satisfying if not a bit heavy on the coconut milk.  It did compare in price and taste to Thai Taste (which is the best Thai in the city IMHO).   My second visit was for dinner this past weekend. I had a gift certificate to use as part of CLT restaurant week promotion. For an appetizer I split the shrimp hot and sour soup with my boyfriend.  This was excellent, a good balance of tangy and spicy, and the presentation was nice.  For dinner he had Pad Thai and I had the signature dish, crispy red curry duck.  His Pad Thai was not impressive just okay as far as the thai staple goes. It seemed to have too much rice wine vinegar in it. You can definitely find better and cheaper elsewhere. The crispy red curry duck was disappointing. The duck had obviously been fried earlier in the day and sat in it's sauce for a while because it was not crispy, nor was the meat particularly juicy. The sauce was delicious but I expected a lot more for $25 and  promise of the chef's signature.  The biggest disappointment of the night though was not being able to order dessert. All through dinner I watched the large open kitchen push out orders of green tea fried ice cream and I couldnt wait to get some.  But when we went to order dessert our waiter told us the kitchen was closed.  I found this really surprising. I've worked as a server before in places no where near as nice as this, and we always asked our tables if they wanted anything else before the restaurant closed down the kitchen.   You are definitely paying for the modern upscale atmosphere when you eat at Basil.  It's probably a nice spot for those who live nearby. I would recommend trying it for lunch to see if it's for you. But if you want truly good Thai in Charlotte, you don't need to spend more for it here.",

    "text": "*This review is from a person that hasn't eaten Thai before*  My girlfriend and I went on a double date and told me that we were going to eat at Basil. The biggest gripe that I have about uptown is parking. I REFUSE to pay for parking if I don't have to, so I found a spot on 6th street and I was good to go. I believe they do offer valet parking for 5 bucks.  We arrived at the restaurant before the people we were supposed to be meeting, so that gave me a little time to check the place out. The restaurant is well put together. It had a modern feel to it with the lights dimmed to create a nice romantic and intimate feel. They finally came, so we get seated. I'm not sure what to order, so I took suggestions. For the appetizer, I tried the Fresh Basil Rolls, which I did NOT enjoy. It tasted like I was eating a slimy eraser or something. The waitress was semi-annoying as well. We all just had water, so she brought a really nice glass jug (which i thought about hijacking, haha) and placed it in the middle of the table. We didn't even touch the full jug b/c she kept on filling out water with another jug. I'd like to believe that i'm fully capable of pouring my own water, but maybe that's just me. I guess the jug was there for decoration or something , haha.  For the meal, I tried the Pad-See-Eu with Chicken. It was actually a very good dish. It just wasn't enough for me. When they brought our food to the table (which took about 30 minutes), I told my girlfriend that we'll probably have to make a stop to McDonalds or something b/c this wasn't going to be enough food for me, haha.  Like I stated in the beginning, this review is written from someone who has never eaten Thai before. The place was nice, but it isn't on my must-go places to check out when I wanna go out to eat",

True it costs a little more than the other Thai places, but the flavor and quality make it worth it.  We gave the place another shot a couple months ago and have been back many times since.  I usually get the Pad See-Eu with beef.  It has just the right combination of sweet and salty with the perfect amount of egg.  The Masaman Curry that my wife gets is quite good as well, and it works well for those that don't like spicy food.  I have tried tofu in the noodle and curry dishes in place of meat and the result is just about as tasty.  The crispy duck in red curry is good too if you enjoy duck.  My friend ordered the three flavored fried fish and it was tasty and large.  It was a nice sized flounder...don't forget to flip it over and eat the other side!  We have enjoyed all of the appetizers and desserts as well so I can't recommend a specific, just try what looks good to you that day!",

As everyone else has mentioned the ambiance in this restaurant is very contemporary and quite enjoyable.  The food was pretty good as well.  We ordered the stuffed shrimp appetizer which was just okay but my entree was quite tasty and had plenty of heat as I ordered it THAI HOT.  Depending upon the dish you order your entree is served with rice (noodle dishes do not come with rice)  It seemed as though two people could split an entree and have plenty to eat.  The next time I go back depending upon the occasion I will request to sit at the bar that overlooks the kitchen.  The food may be a little overpriced but the nice interior helps compensate.",

There would have been a one and a half hour wait for two of us, but the hostess told us that we could try the \"lounge\" area. The lounge is a room full of couches with coffee tables and is a great choice. We sat immediately. For as small as it is, I was surprised how long it took a server to get to us for drink orders, but it wasn't a terribly long time. We ordered and people watched the sidewalk outside. I'm pretty sure the server forgot our drinks because they showed up after our meal. The food was good. Mine could have been spicier, but I can't blame them for that. I also found it odd that the rice for the meal came out 10 or so minutes before the rest of the meal, so it could get good and cold before everything else showed up. I felt the price was slightly high for what I got. After we were done, both the servers we had seen that night had disappeared. We sat waiting for a box and check for about 20 minutes before someone showed up. Overall: Food = good, not great (for the price), service = ok, not good.",

I can understand certain rules they need to follow - especially if they are busy,  but they are taking things a bit too far and will loose customers because of their policies. They do not take reservations even for large parties, therefore we were told to get there by 11:15 am - which we did. There were only a few people in the restaurant. The 3 cars let everyone out and proceeded to park.. which was a safari into the surrounding area.  We asked to be seated since 90% of us were physically present......but they refused to seat us!  We had to occupy the entrance and the outside of the restaurant to wait for the others in our party to return from their car parking... because they assumed that the people parking the cars may get lost and never show up... Fast forward 10 minutes until the car parkers get there and they can confirm that we were really telling the truth that there were 15 people...so they could finally seat us. .. then  we find out that there must be 1 ticket for the whole table because at 11:30 with hardly any customers, it was just too hard to split the check up....so we ended up sitting at 2 tables next to each other to at least split the check into 2 bills to make it easier for one person to pay and collect from us later. If the team wants to go again, I will go with them, but otherwise, they will not get my business again. I don't care how good your food is, if you act like your customers should be privileged to grace your establishment, I have no use for you.",

For instance, our salads came and we had no utensils. We had to wave at the bartender to try to get his attention, but to no avail. We finally caught the other bartender's attention. Thirty minutes after finishing our salads, the Chicken Pad Thai finally arrived. The food was below mediocre at best. Will never return.

They were pretty packed in here, but we were seated pretty quickly - they set up and beat their own expectation of 15 minutes.    I ordered the Noodle Salad lunch special because I was ambivalent.  That is to say, the dishes all looked pretty good, but didn't know what I was really in the mood for.  The lunch special was pretty good.  For those curious about it, it's like an udon noodle soup, with a little less broth and some lettuce, some vegetables, and shrimp and beef.  At the end of our meal (colleague ordered same thing), you could tell we were pretty happy people - both are bowls were empty!   Basil, you continue to impress me.   dmo out.",

The main thing here is that I got the feeling that Basil was not interested in serving a large group.  I tried making a reservation for 16 people for a work function.  The person who answered the phone took my name, number, and email address and said they would get back to me later that day after they spoke with their \"Events Coordinator\", but didn't foresee any problems.  That was 2 days ago.  Needless to say, I called them back and told them we made other arrangements.  I've never had any bad experiences here and have always had great food, but if you are going with a big group, I would choose another establishment.",

We had the best waiter ever so helpful but not pushy at all just very helpful. For appetizers we had one order of Chicken Satay and one order of Beef Satay with peanut sauce. Both were very good, loved the beef ones it is really difficult to find a Thai place that has Beef Satay. For are entrees we had one order of Beef Garlic delicious so much flavor, the other entree was Pad Prik Beef the flavor is out of this world so good,I was going to order the Basil but waiter suggested the Pad Prik so happy with his suggesting of Pad Prik. Both orders came with brown rice. For dessert we had one order of flourless cake and one order of Mango and sticky rice both were so good! I would highly recommend Basil Thai if you are visiting Charlotte or living there.",

I really liked the marble tabletops and fell in love with the water glasses - I know - weird. The corner location is kind of fun for people watching as well.  I am a big fan of Chicken Larb - and theirs was really good - just the way I like it with lots of cilantro, lemon and just the right amount of fish sauce. We were able to substitute lettuce for cabbage with no problem.  Probably the best thing we had was the Tom Kha Gai soup - served in a hot pot with a sterno flame for a truly snazzy presentation. I'm used to Tom Kha broth having quite a bit of chicken broth in it with a little coconut milk - this was mostly (if not all coconut milk) and was delicious. The portion was large enough to where we each had three small bowls of it.  Deciding between Green and Red, the Green was recommended. The flavors were great. I do agree with others comments that the curry portions are a bit on the small side but between splitting the three dishes between us, we were stuffed.  The Jasmine tea was awesome - I think I drank 3 or 4 pots of it. I was so jazzed (no pun intended) I could done 100 or so jumping jacks.  Laura - take a bow and thanks for taking great care of us!! Fresh plates, silverware, ice water and tea water - she was on top of things and we wanted for nothing. Her timing of ordering and bringing out dishes was excellent - we felt relaxed and everything was served hot and fresh. And it's okay that you don't know who Janeane Garofolo is - I just have to remember I'm getting old. LOL!",

I'm not a huge eggroll fan but these were crisp and very flavorful.  For the main dish, I had the traditional chicken and shrimp pad thai.

Visited on a Sunday night after a big sporting event and was told the wait would be an hour, totally understood given the stadium emptying out, thousands flooding the area and it being a Sunday night. Thankfully another restaurant across the street had availability at the bar and we were able to have a couple of drinks while we waited.   Once in we quickly ordered the stuffed shrimp appetizer and subsequently Pad See-Eu and Volcano Shrimp.   The stuffed shrimp came out quickly but were very ordinary and nothing special at all. We then waited over 40 minutes for our entrees and watched as plates and plates of hot fresh food piled up on the kitchen exit shelf and sat there getting cold as the wait staff could not keep up. Pad See-Eu is a dish I usually always go with at Thai restaurants and the version here was well below par. Lacking flavor and served with regular broccoli as opposed to real Chinese broccoli it was really disappointing. The Volcano Shrimp was listed as a \"Speciality\" but was far from special despite the speciality price. By the time it reached us it was warm as opposed to hot, after sitting for so long. A few shrimp in a sauce that was just flat out bad. I would describe it as a sweet and sour dipping sauce mixed with a can of tomatoes.   Extremely disappointed as this was advertised as one of Uptown Charlottes better restaurants.",

Perhaps, I ordered the wrong thing to truly appreciate the Thai cuisine?",

The food had just the right amount of flavor to it to make sure it wasn't over powering everything else. Service there was great to our waitress was very attentive to our needs and was always am checking back with us to make share everything was to our satisfaction. Overall, going to Basil for the first time it was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "Cool restaurants located Uptown, just past the hustle and bustle. The server was kind enough and the food came out relatively quickly.   There were three if us and we shared the wonton soup and three summer (basil) rolls as appetizers. The wonton soup has a cool presentation but is not practical for getting every last drop of soup because the ladle is unable to scoop the soup and cabbage from the bottom. The soup was tasty with a few spice variations from the typical version which added freshness. The basil rolls were okay but not what we expected as they were pretty much just filled with thin noodles and not many vegetables as we expected.   I had the red curry with chicken and it was good but I expected a sweetness that wasn't as present as I hoped. (I order this fish regularly and make it at home) The portion wasn't as large as other restaurants but was filling nonetheless.   I'd like to come back and give Basil Thai another shot.",

Try the chicken Massaman curry, it is rich and very flavorful --I love that fragrant yellow curry.    Four Yelps.",

    "text": "As other's have pointed out Basil is Thai food with a modern decor. We had a late dinner Sunday after 8pm in mid-June. We we were able to walk in and immediately be seated. As you would expect on a Sunday evening after dinner hours the restaurant was mostly empty with a few people off the left in the bar.  We were seated about halfway to the back. In the very back of the dining room there is a table for maybe 10 people. There are curtains that could be closed off if you have a group that wants some privacy.  Seated looking over the kitchen we didn't hear anyone from the bar only the downtempo electronic music floating gently through the space. The lighting is dim without being dark. The kitchen is of polished steel and glass such that you can see the staff preparing your meal, but the partition does not extend so low that you can see exactly what is being done, only their general movements. Basil Thai definitely comes through in atmosphere for cool, modern decor for intimate dinner.  The other part of the Basil Thai equation is of course the Thai food. Basil Thai is modern in its decor but not so much its interpretation of the Thai cuisine like you might find in the application of Indian food at Copper. They prepare traditional recipes in flavorful and satisfying ways. We started with their Basil Roll that is their interpretation of the spring roll. It is as you would expect, light refreshing and an excellent choice for an appetizer. What will surprise you is the different type of sauce they pair with the roll. I had the Crispy Red Curry Duck. I have not had this particular dish before but I found it wonderful. The skin was tenderly  crispy and the sauce was rich without being overpowering. If you prefer a spicer taste you will want to ask for it. The portions are generous that I had enough for lunch the next day.  My girlfriend had the Pad Thai and was very pleased with it. Most of the entrees have a reasonable price and while the duck is on the highest end of the menu it's a good splurge.  For good Thai food in a quiet setting downtown different that your traditional ethnic setting Basil Thai will serve your well.",

Two complaints:  brown rice tasted like it was cooked hours ago; basil rolls (fresh rolls) were super-boring - I watched them make tofu ones and shrimp ones and ate tofu ones  - rice paper with lots of rice noodles + two tiny shrimp (or two skinny tofu pieces), a teaspoon of cabbage + 1 basil leaf (you can't taste it - it is for decoration only).  Sauce was great though... So, definitely recommend, just don't order the rolls and maybe go with jasmine rice, which is probably ordered more frequently.",

Normally I am not a fan of Thai food, and going to Thai Taste on East Blvd once, made me realize why I don't like the food. However, I really enjoyed the food here. Great atmosphere for couples or groups. Even though it only opened on Monday, they didn't miss a beat and service was right on.   They have a restaurant in Charleston as well that gets rave reviews also. This place definately adds to the restaurant chocies in 4th ward and is perfect starting place for a night out. Check it out!",

I ordered the tilapia & it was excellent. My husband had the curry duck which was also very tasty. Also ordered the appetizers, stuffed shrimp & chicken wings as meals for the kids & they both loved it. A bit pricy for Thai food (reason for 4 stars) but worth it. Would def recommend to others to visit.",

    "text": "David booked a reservation here for a birthday dinner at 7:30, we arrived a bit early at 7:03 and were seated promptly with no problem by the pleasant hostess. The interior is a bit more trendy than the usual Thai place. I dig the lighting that reminds me of carnations. I had dirty silverware at my table but it got promptly replaced as soon as I mentioned it. I think the server could have at least said sorry or something though.  I was already quite full from a picnic party in the park earlier in the day which consisted of ribs, fried chicken, bbq chicken, cole slaw, potato salad, and lots of alcohol. I decided what the heck with and ordered the crispy red curry duck, while my partner ordered the Basil Duck to share and check out the differences. The food came out very fast though I have a minor gripe with garnishing a dish with stuff that doesn't add anything to it. The basil duck is HOT! I'm not much of a fan of spice so it was a bit spicy for me but still delicious. The red curry duck however is crispy and a bit salty unless eaten with generous amounts of rice that is provided. The curry was seasoned very well I must say, I wish they put the same amount of effort into their rice. It was plain and boring, I felt like it could've used an extra rinse as it was very starchy. At the end of the dinner they brought out some fried green tea ice cream with a candle on it and wished me happy birthday, what a nice way to end a birthday dinner!  I feel like I would've been less picky about the food and enjoyed if I was hungrier. But I did tear apart that green tea ice cream though yum! The seating is kind of close together and you can hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. For giving me free fried ice cream I'm a fan though it is a bit more than I would usually pay for Thai food.",

    "text": "(2.5 stars)  This was my 1st stop at a Thai place in Charlotte after many years in Brooklyn.  Decor is nice I suppose but we (wife and I) ate outside since it was a beautiful evening and the A/C was quite cold.  The waitress was friendly and the service was good although it was a Saturday night and got quite crowded later on and was  bit hard to find our waitress for the check.  She never rushed us, despite the line waiting for a table, which was nice.    The food was good. Veggie basil rolls to start were a bit bland but nice consistency and the sauce was good.  I had a spicy chicken basil noodle dish which was quite good, nice level of spice, and sweet but not overly so.  There was VERY little basil in my dish, which was quite a disappointment for me.  The portions were overly large in my opinion, as I couldn't finish, and I can always finish.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp curry very much.  The draft beers we had were excellent.  My biggest gripe is quite simply the prices.  16 dollars for Pad Thai or any other basic dish, and 20+ for anything with shrimp is premium for me if I am eating Thai.  I expect to be wowed by the food for those prices, and while it was good, I never approached \"wow\"-dom.  Frankly, it seems like the type of place where you pay for the trendy ambience, and to be surrounded by good looking people.  If that's your thing, this is a five star recommendation.  I honestly couldn't care less about those things so I'm not a big fan.",

I had the green curry \"Thai hot\", meaning the heat level was maximum, and my wife had pad thai. The pad thai was delicious, the best i have had outside of Thailand. The green curry was just so-so - maybe i killed it by ordering it too hot - it turned out red color instead of green, and the flavors became obscured by the heat. We also shared a bowl of Tom Yum soup which was good - a little too sweet, but otherwise had a lot of good flavors in it, the simple sugar in it almost killed it though. I doubt we will be back soon.",

I personally can't have gluten. We chose this place hoping to have some good luck and have a nice dinner as well as good service. When we walked in the host sat us, it took 15 minutes for our server, which looked like the only server to come over to help us and take our order. Meanwhile we were given water by the host. Because I have to have GF foods I asked what was GF on the menu. I was told that there was a special menu that was \"hidden\" it took 15 minutes to receive it. Meanwhile we asked for hot tea, that came out before the menu but it was 10 minutes, he said that it was \"special tea\" that's why it took so long. Now we decided it was okay to order, when I began to ask questions about the menu I was given a lot of negative attitude he was more concerned about the table behind him. My parter ordered spring rolls and I ordered a coconut soup, the spring rolls came out fine, although my soup came out in a metal bowl with a flame in the middle I asked to not have it in the bowl with the flame the person that brought it out tried to put the candle out on the table by putting a plate over it. This made the flame 10 times higher than it was before when he lifted up the plate almost burning me. I just had them take it back. Needless to say, awful food, awful service. We will not be going back, avoid this place!",

The thaitini was a lot better than I've had at other places as well, tasted more like they actually made the Thai tea and not like some sugary powder mix. Everyone's meals came out delicious and presented nicely. Huge serving!! So I feel it was well worth the money. We showed up very close to closing time by I didn't feel like they were trying to rush us out. Fast and friendly service, great atmosphere and delicious food.

Corner of Church and 5th so yea parking can be a pain.  If you can find a spot on the street go ahead, but why waste the time looking?  $5 for valet and WELL worth it.  Just valet the cars, and tip the fellas working.  Walk into Basil and expect a nice classy restaurant.  A small spot but plenty of seating.  Bar area is pretty cool with very comfy seating.  Nice decor all around and the staff is superb.  Even when it was packed I was well attended to.  I heard from numerous folks that the dishes were huge, and generally had enough for two.  Not my experience, though I had take out.  Let me just say, if your going to eat Basil...  dine in.  $15 for a Thai dish is ridiculous if your getting take out.  What your paying for is the location and service.  I will pay again, but I will dine in.  The to go order was far smaller than any other Thai place Ive been to.  Though the flavor here seemed to be top notch and probably... no is the best Pad Thai I've had.  I wont order to go again, but I will dine in.  So if you are uptown, like Thai food, want a nice restaurant, and better service... Come to Basil!  Valet your ride!  Don't get take out!    Be forewarned, its good so its busy.",

Since it was our first visit to Basi, we decided to stick with a standard - pad thai. Theirs was not the best I have ever eaten, but it was quite good.    A friend met up with us who is a regular there and he got the red curry - I tasted it and it was excellent!  Next time, I will definitely order that.   We ordered mango sticky rice and coconut ice cream... that is a totally fabulous combination!   Our server was not very attentive and he had almost a surly attitude, so I was underwhelmed in terms of the service... but the food was really good.",

The waiter that attended to us was attentive and checked up on us ever so often but not \"too often\" like how some waiters do just to force a good tip out of you. My sister and I ordered the Thai Fried Chicken for appetizers and the Tom Yum Goong and Green Curry for the main. Everything was on point. As a half thai myself, I found the dishes relatively authentic aside from the lack of spiciness, but it is understandable as they are catering to the majority of the crowd. The only downfall about my experience was that they did not have 2 of their famous desserts (sticky mango rice & fried bananas). However, overall I really can't find any major faults about this restaurant. I would really recommend this to anyone in the Charlotte Uptown area!",

We began with appetizers, which I tried the Shrimp Puffs, and all I will say is LOVE! They were cooked to perfection. Others enjoyed the basil rolls & soup, which they all seemed to enjoy. As for the entrees, we ordered a variety of items, and as w/ the appetizers, everyone seemed to enjoy! I had the Pad Thai which I loved & was able to enjoy the left-overs tonight, because I forgot to add the portions are large.

    "text": "I will say that I'm very disappointed and a little disgusted in the business practices. While the food can be very good at times the way they run and do business is a little unprofessional in my opinion. A business only has one chance to mess up with me and Thai Basil of Charlotte used that chance.  I called to confirm what is the cut off time to place lunch takeout orders were, and I was told that because the kitchen closes at 2:30 the last time to place an order would be 2:15/ 2:20.  With that being said I placed a call at 2:05 and the phone rang out or picked up with no one saying anything on the line. I tried for the next 15 minutes to reach the restaurant and to no avail I \"could not reach\" the host that takes orders.  With that being said I decided to take a walk to the restaurant while dialing the phone to the restaurant and watched the host ignore the phone that was ringing. I was giving a sob story of that there was something wrong with the phones and either of the lines picked up. I asked if I can still place my order since they had communication issues. While the host walked to the kitchen to see if I could she quickly came back to say she was sorry I could not. I did not believe her for one second and felt she was not being truthful about the entire situation. The proper thing to do would have been to take my order due to the establishment have issues with their phones.  Not just stick to a lame excuse of phone system malfunction. Again you only have one chance to not do the right thing by me as a customer.  So sad that I now have to be honest  and Sharon my experience with my network about Basil in Charlotte NC.",

I couldn't help but feel that I was paying for the ambience and decor (quite upscale and attractive) rather than the food (not quite as upscale or impressive).   I had the basil vodka martini, and found it to be overwhelmingly sweet, and lacking in any basil kick. For food we ordered pretty standard items - mixed veggies, green curry, pad see noodles with basil and spice, and the fish in special sauce. I will say the fish was cooked to perfection, but the tomato based sauce was overwhelming and sweet. The green curry was good, the noodles were not spectacular, I do wish they'd kicked up the flavor.   Service was ok. Dessert options were not appealing to me. I don't really want to order cheesecake or blueberry pie at a Thai place. I want thai desserts. But that's just me.",

I haven't a clue, but I WILL tell you that the dishes are as authentic as they're gonna be when you find yourself this far down the South.   I would say their best dishes are the \"curries\" and the noodles. Go for the Chicken Masaman Curry. It will blow... your mind. It's got a savory and creamy coconut base that's incredibly addicting. I would lick the bowl clean if I wasn't surrounded by co-workers. My second favorite item is the Beef Pad See Ew.  Large portion of mouth-watering flat noodles with vegetables and stir-fried beef.   My one qualm with this place is my experience with the specialty dishes. I tried the $22.95 Basil Duck and was not impressed in the slightest. Granted, they fry the shizzle out of the duck, so of course, one can't expect that robust of a flavor from the marinade, but I was looking for a wow factor, which somehow never came through. AND i lost 23 bucks :(  Since you're probably gonna dish out some dough when you come here, I wouldn't spend time ordering any of the specialty dishes, and instead, take a couple of appetizers (spring rolls? lettuc wraps?) and one good entree. That's definitely going to fill you up and make you smell like Thailand for a couple of days.   NOTE: After eating a full meal here, your productivity levels in the work place decrease exponentially, so eat with caution! Food Coma to ensue... zzzzzZzz  4/5",

I first went to Basil in the week that it opened, and it was already near-perfect. The owner had started with a similar restaurant in Charleston and did a wonderful job of smoothly transplanting the expertise. It has since become a mainstay of uptown dining. The food is excellent without the expense and stuffiness of Bentley's or Capital Grille. These days the only danger is that the restaurant will be too crowded. On weekends reservations are essential, and often the small entryway will be filled with a hopeful but soon-to-be-disappointed crowd. Muscle through and claim your table.  But I have one quarrel. Although the dinning prices are very reasonable, charging full price for take-out is a slap in the face.  Oh! And their website has a great mobile version that is dead-easy to use on your iPhone/blackberry/android/whatever. Very slick.",

Most recent I went last week(07/31/2014) the service was horrible and the food was a bit cold, and I can give them the benefit of the doubt because it was very crowded. About a month ago, the services was mediocre but the food was excellent. Then a few months back both the food and service were great. So if you go probably will get both good food and service, but be aware that experience will definitively vary.",

When we finally were seated, the hostess found us a super comfy booth. My husband and I agreed that it was certainly worth the wait. Our waitress brought us another drink while we perused the menu. I always ask for suggestions from our server and I love when their ideas are exactly what I was thinking about ordering ... the spring rolls were excellent as was my husband's chicken massaman curry. The slightly-less-bright spot of the entire evening was my pad thai. It was totally fine - just not outstanding. I ate half of it and brought the rest home for lunch the next day. (The entree portions were incredibly large, by the way...)   We cannot wait to go back and eat here.

To start -- if you are from the state of Michigan, or just love Bells Oberon, they had it on tap which was quite the pleasant surprise! They don't put an orange slice in your Oberon in Charlotte though so make sure to ask for one if you'd like.  The Egg Rolls were light, crisp, and nice. Served with a sweet and sour sauce they were about as good as this generic appetizer comes. The Pad Thai was also very good. They serve it in no spice, medium spice, and Thai Spicy. I got medium spice and it was more than enough for me. They did not try to reinvent the wheel with their Pad Thai but it was simple and very tasty.   Overall this was a very solid Thai restaurant. The classic dishes I ordered were good, and the Coconut Chicken (had by the guy next to me at the bar) smelled amazing as well. In my opinion trying Basil Thai is a no brainer.",

I can't get enough of the basil rolls. They taste so fresh! The egg rolls looked great, but I wouldn't know, as they pulled a vanishing act by a magician boyfriend. Both times I have had the pulled duck salad, served with a wedge of lettuce, pineapple, cashews, ginger, and scallions. It is just so delicious, and only about $7 for a seriously decent amount of food. Specialty salads at most places around here are at least $14, and I have seen higher. Still thinking about that duck...   I tasted the Pad Thai. Very good. Is it just me though, or are the noodles here thinner than traditional Thai? But I wouldn't know the difference.

The waitress was welcoming and accommodated my request to add a seafood combination rather than just shrimp as it was on the menu. I went with her suggestion of the infused pineapple mojito...a winner!  Not that it wasn't good, It just wasn't the greatest Thai drunken noodle I ever had. This is the dish I love the most and I was disappointed because it wasn't served with homemade wide rice noodles, Spiciness or visibility of the basil leaves, I counted 2 basil leaves, and the taste was a bit off... Why is this place called basil if it lacks of basil. The prices were high as I was charged $22 total just to add the seafood. rather than the $15 Shrimp drunken noodle. Still nice staff, nice place...",

    "text": "I went with a group of 8 to Basil a few Saturdays ago and had an amazing time! It was my first trip to Basil, and I had no clue the culinary wonderment that awaited me.   Let me start out by saying, I felt a bit under-dressed & will snaz it up next time. I quickly downed a glass of savignon blanc and a few shots of sake so I felt more comfortable in my jean jacket, target dress & boots. Once the edge of feeling under-dressed was taken off, I had a fantabulous time.   We ordered the spring rolls as appetizers, my fiance ordered the Pad Thai and I ordered some sort of tilapia (I think it was tilapia) dish that was a treat for the tastebuds. I'm not sure what the rest of the party ordered, but everyone left with a clean plate and smiles on their faces... so I'm assuming they weren't disappointed.   I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place & felt like a complete baller because Angie Harmon and her husband, Jason Sehorn (I think that's how it's spelled) were sitting in a booth across from us!!! It's not every day that you see famous peeps in Charlotte, so that was quite a treat!  Will I be back to Basil? Yes, soon & very soon, next time I'm hoping to see Oprah.",

We went to two different sushi places that were too busy to seat us before going to Basil. We almost didn't go in because it looked closed from a distance. (Basil, the window tinting is way too good at night.)  By the time we got there, we were starving...what an impression on my guests, right? Taking them all over...but third time is a charm! The server was very friendly and accommodated to our growling stomachs. We got an order of spring rolls while waiting for the main dishes. Yummy. I got an order of Pad Thai, mild to medium spice. It was delicious!! We loved their spicy sauces and our server had to restock our table at least once.  Great atmosphere. Good location. Delicious food. Attentive service.  Granted, the prices are a bit more than you'd expect to pay for Thai food...but the service and quality of food made it worth it.",

I had Chicken Pad See Eu, my boyfriend had Beef Fried Rice, and another friend had Pad Kee Mow. All of them were really great! The food was delicious and beautifully presented. We also had drinks, which were pricy ($9-11/mixed drink), but good. I really recommend the \"Thaitini!\" We followed up with desserts - Fried Banana (with coconut ice cream) and Fried (Green Tea) Ice Cream. Both of them were tasty! The menu isn't super innovative or large, but what it includes is served really well.   I also really liked the atmosphere. It's casual enough for an after work meet up but classy enough for a nice date. The chairs were super comfortable, but some of them were pretty worn. The waitstaff was phenomenal! Our water glasses were always full, and our waitress was attentive without being intrusive. It seemed liked she'd been professionally trained. Even when the restaurant was really busy, she gave each of her tables a lot of attention. Probably the best waitress I've ever had.",

Ordered the stuffed shrimp appetizer, Beef Salad, the Crispy Duck Red Curry (signature dish), and Pad Kee Mow.  The food was above average, but I have definitely had better Thai food for about half the price. The \"Crispy\" Red Duck was not what I expected as the skin was rubbery and inedible, actual duck meat was pretty good though. The ambiance was definitely geared toward younger crowds and dates which was nice. Service was average, the waitress forgot our order of Pad Kee Mow so we had to order it midway through our duck curry. At the end of the meal, we asked to look at the dessert menu and she came back with the check instead. Not the greatest listener.......",

Ambience: Cool, trendy. Good for lunch or sit down dinner. Asian statues, flower petals on the ceiling lamps.   Food: My two favorites are the Pad See Ew and the Basil Noodle Soup (their variation on pho). The Pad See Ew has a delicious sauce. The soup is huge; I ask for half the noodles and still don't eat them all. The broth tastes really good.   The biggest downside is that it's ridiculously crowded at lunchtime.

He could not stop gushing about the amazing food, ambiance and service. I was expecting to not be able to get a table on a Friday night, but I figured I'd try. So around 7 I called Basil asking for a table for two... in 15 minutes. They happily told me to come on over.  Basil is a pretty nice set-up. It has high-ceilings, modern decor and subtle hints of Thai culture. Located in the center of Charlotte, I was worried Basil would be a tourist trap, but walking in my concerns faded away.   Thanks to Yelp tips, we ordered the Chicken Coconut Soup. Holy crap. I would fly down to North Carolina right now if I could to have it for dinner. That was some spectacular soup. And what an insanely big portion! We were boring and split a plate of pad thai, which was delicious, but not mind blowing like the soup. Not that pad thai could really ever be mind blowing.  The later it got, the more 'date-night' the crowd became. But when we first got there it was more of a happy hour scene. I'm sure no matter what the occasion, a group would enjoy themselves here. The food is great, the drinks are yummy and the service is on point. It is a little pricey, but much less than they should be charging for such a wonderful dining experience. I will no doubt come here if I'm ever in Charlotte again, because obviously, I'm in love with Basil.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Basil I gave them a 1 star review and it was for the lackluster service we capped off the night with which centered around the big issue of \"extra sauce\". We had leftovers, we asked for a small container of extra curry to take home, they said no, we said ???, they said because, we said really, they said yeah... etc... which left us avoiding Basil for over three years. Recently we (my wife and I) found ourselves considering a revisit and after much debate decided three years was long enough and we gave Basil another shot.   This time we started the night off by asking our waitress up front... what's up with ban on take home sauce? She was honest (and polite) and said it was just a policy thing but if we wanted to order the dish with extra sauce then we would have some to take home later. With that in mind we ordered the Crispy Red Curry Duck which is described as \"Chef Suntorn's Signature Dish with Boneless half duck deep-fried, topped with bell peppers, basil, green peas, snow peas, tomatoes, pineapple, dressed in red curry sauce\". In the three years since our first trip to Basil we have been to a dozen new Thai restaurants and developed a strong love for the duck with red curry dish. Unfortunately, Basil's take on a Thai classic is off the mark.   The dish was \"ok\" which is far below the \"wow\" we expect from this \"Refined Thai\" restaurant. The curry was light on flavor, the peppers and tomatoes were left way too big, and the duck... although a generous portion of meat was provided... the pieces were unwieldy and the deep-fried skin was mushy. All in all, I found myself wishing we had gone to Thai Taste in Dilworth instead and I certainly don't see myself giving Basil a third visit anytime soon or in the future. The dish was weak and if you love leftovers you're left eating them on the dry side because of their ridiculous policy of no \"take home\" sauce.",

    "text": "It was date night for my wife & I, and on this night, we decided to go to Basils. My wife has never been there before, and had an expectation of excellence towards the food after hearing me rave about my two time experience from ordering their take out. Upon walking in, the hostess was welcoming, and the server escorted us to our seats. Everything was flowing nicely with the exception of feeling a wired vibe from the setting within the restaurant as we walked to our seats, and shortly after sat at our table. My wife ordered the Red Curry Duck, I ordered the Basil mixed seafood, and our food was brought out within a reasonable amount of time. After tasting the Duck, it was found not to be to either of our liking after my wife asked for me to taste it to see if I felt the same way. We informed our server of our dislike for the dish who in turn informed her supervisor Michael who came to our table to see what could be done. My wife decided to substituted the Duck for the chicken, and felt that would suffice. But, it was at that time that everything changed. Michael agreed to change the protein of the dish to chicken as requested, and took the plate away. However, prior to leaving the table, he had the nerve to take the plate that my wife was eating from that had some of the food that I had placed on her plate, and did it in a manner that would be distasteful to any consumer. My wife said to him, \"I'm still eating\", and he replied saying, \"I still have to take your plate\" with a smile on his face as if that smile made it okay. As Michael was pulling my wife's plate away, she had to quickly grab the last piece of shrimp that I had placed on her plate which left us stunned asking each other, \"Did that really just happen\"?. With that not sitting well with us, we instantly decided that we were never going to return to an establishment that treated their patrons as such, and left us disgusted. While waiting for the reorder of the dish to be brought back to the table, We agreed that we no longer felt comfortable sitting in this place of business, agreed to pay for our food, and immediately leave. Instead of waiting for the server to return, I got up from the table, and walked over to the hostess along with our server who was standing near the hostess to ask for our bill. I further asked for the name of the manager who came to our table who was identified to being Michael BC I wanted you all, my readers to know who to lookout for if any of you so chose to visit this place. I returned to the table, and after sitting down for a few seconds, Michael returned to the table to collect our remaining dishes, and did it in the same distasteful manner from when he collected my wife's plate earlier. My wife and I looked at each other, looked at Michael, and we couldn't believe what was happening. Shortly after that, here comes manager #2, named Chris. He came to the table asking how everything was, and came across concerned. I looked at him with confusion after he identified himself as the manager after just being told that Michael was the manager by the hostess. Chris advised that Basils has several managers during a shift, and said he was there to see if he could smooth things over after hearing from our server along with the hostess of our dissatisfaction. He offered his apologies for what had occurred after explaining the situation to him along with an invitation to join him for a wine tasting at the front of the restaurant to make up for Michaels distasteful actions, but we were already turned off. We wanted no parts of anything they had to offer, and was just ready to leave. Our reordered dish was brought to us by Michael who handed us the reordered dish in a bag as if he was kicking us out trying to come across as if he was being helpful, but was far from it. Feeling overwhelmed with the totality of everything, we walked to the front of the restaurant instead of waiting for our server to return to us in order to pay for our meals after talking with Chris. We paid for our meals, and left feeling very disappointed. Prior to leaving Chris told us that they get disciplined for comping meals which I'm assuming that's he thought we were expecting, but we quickly informed him, that wasn't something that we were looking for. I felt slightly insulted by that comment, but paid him no mind, and continued on. As we walked to our car, I apologized to my wife for her first time experience being tarnished, and we continued on with our evening. With us not being pleased with the service that we received, I hope you all will take this review into consideration, and think twice about going to this establishment. In the words of Arsenio Hall, Basils is one of those places that makes you go hmmmmmmm !!!",

I would gladly give the soup 5 stars, the green curry is 3 stars, and the pricing is 2 stars.  Composite score is 3 stars.  Major score factors: 1) Pricing - this place costs 33% more than it should be.  The soup was about $10 for a large bowl and it was mostly delicious broth, so I would have been happy at $8.  The pricing completely loses meaning on the green curry, it was $14 and it was probably not much more than the soup, so I would say $9.  On the entree we are overpriced by 50%, and the soup at 25%.  I didn't even get drinks, but I don't include drinks because they are a category onto themselves.  Be warned - the green curry is a very sparing serving size. 2) Serving sizes - the soup has an excellent serving size both in the bowl and in the cup.  The entrees are undersized a bit, usually I can't finish an entree and a cup of soup, but this time I was able to finish a bowl of soup and polish off most of the entree.  If I hadn't gotten soup I would have had to stop at the hot dog stand on the way back to the office. 3) Flavor - the taste of the soup was spot on.  Not too strong, not too weak.  I could have handled slightly stronger soup, but it had such a satisfying coconut flavor the lack of lemon grass notes was just fine by me.  For whatever reason the soup so dominated my flavor receptors that the curry tasted downright bland. 4) Menu options - I am not pleased with the lack of lunch menu and the options on the menu.  There were some Thai dishes I was looking for and didn't find - some Amazing Chicken would have been amazing.",

    "text": "I always thought Basil would be some watered down version of Thai food with high prices, because of the location and the \"cool\" vibe (*cough* Enso).  I am glad we gave it a shot, though, because it delivered as a solid Thai restaurant.  The cocktail menu is nice and the drinks are not overpriced.  We tried the Basil Rolls, but I was disappointed, because there was barely any shrimp in there.  The highlight of my visit was trying the Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut) Tureens an appetizer.  This was some delicious soup.  We got it with tofu, because I was with some vegans, but it was still great.  As an entree, we tried the Vegetables Delight w/ chicken and the Pad-see ee (flat noodles), which were very fresh, not too greasy, and tasted great.  I would probably order these again next time I make it to Basil.  Overall, we enjoyed our time at Basil.  The food was pretty solid, and the prices were reasonable.  There are a few good Thai places in Charlotte that I would go to first over Basil, but that does not mean it was not a good restaurant.",

But very flavorful. Unfortunately they didn't have ingredients for the drink I ordered. So ended up just having water. But the rest of my party enjoyed their dishes and drinks.   Gets a little loud. Also has another level for a bar. Heard it's another large area for larger gatherings to mingle.  Tip: Make sure you carefully review your check though. They originally charged me for the drink that was not served. Understandable though because she most likely put the order in, then found out that they had none, and simply forgot to remove it.   Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!",

    "text": "Solid 4 Stars!  Went here for lunch with a work friend, and he's a good country boy who's NEVER (I know, hard to believe) had Thai food before! But thankfully, he's got an open mind and receptive palate and eagerly accompanied me to Basil Thai for lunch on a Monday.  I noticed that there was no Satay dish offered for an appetizer, and when I inquired about it, the server said that they can make that no problem! So there it is, just ask for it and it shall come! :-)  The Chicken Satay was everything a good satay should be, with the sweet peanut sauce and a slight twinge of heat (Personally I would have liked a TAD more heat but it was good as is). Chicken was grilled on a skewer with some sort of coconut-inspired \"sauce\" already on the chicken to keep them moist.  I got the Masaman Curry with Beef as my buddy got the Pad Thai. I recommended the Pad Thai since it is, after all, Thailand's national dish. He LOVED it! He may be from the country but the kid's got good taste buds!  Let's just say that both were classic Thai dishes that were well prepared. Next time I will ask for my curry dish to be a TAD bit hotter, but NOT \"Thai Hot!\" OMFG....IF you've ever had that, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about!  In fact, rumor has it that Johnny Cash wrote his famous song \"Ring of Fire\" the day AFTER he had a \"Thai Hot\" dish! Use your imagination....Let's just say that it's much more enjoyable going IN than coming OUT! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!  Yes it does get crazy busy here because the food is darn tootin good. So come at 1130 for lunch or just before the 6pm dinner crowd.  Oh and finally, our waiter did spill water over my buddy's pants....thankfully it was water! He of course was apologetic and did help clean up. Hey it happens....and we didn't hold it against him. Now had that been my curry dish on my pants, well, maybe not so forgiving...But it WAS WATER. All is ok in the world.",

    "text": "This was not the first time we had visited Basil. This was our 35th Anniversary and we selected Basil because of our past favorable experiences. We love the ambiance and the restaurant inside is very nice.  This time we experienced no valet (raining), hostess on the phone almost our entire visit, poor bar service, inefficient wait staff, overpriced food, less than desirable sanitation grade (although technically an A - low A) and the owner walking around (dressed like a beach bum) not talking with anyone. One Star for good food.   We had issues from the beginning. No valet on Monday? Heard others ask about No Valet. Raining like crazy and driving around the city to find parking for dinner. The next day the website said no valet on Monday.   They weren't busy, four tables and four waiters. My wife ordered a champagne cocktail and she told the waiter that if the bartender could not make that just to bring a glass of champagne. They delivered a glass of rose wine. When the waiter sat it down, my wife told him \"this is not champagne.\" He said it was rose champagne. When she tasted it, it definitely was not champagne.  So she ordered a mojito. Then the waiter came back because the bar tender wanted to know if she wanted Prosecco. She does not like Prosecco.  We don't like the same soups so we ordered soup, and were told that it was only available in a multi-person serving size (who does that?). We told the waiter to bring two different kinds anyway. $22 for soup??? After finishing the soup - then the waiter told us that he would put the dinner order into the kitchen.   A waiter learns to times things so that dinner is served after we finished our soup. Come on they can do this at any restaurant. This was not a new waiter... we had him the last time at this restaurant (a couple of years ago).  Then the waiter brought the rice out which sat on the table while the kitchen prepared dinner. The rice was cold when the entree arrived.  Our dinner was good, but not fabulous.   Large plates with lots of sauce and vegetables for a very expensive Thai dinner ($27 for the volcano shrimp - they were jumbo but only 4). The spicy level does not warrant an indication on the menu. They did provide chili sauce, Thai pickled peppers and Thai spice powder to the table.   Then we got the waiter to put my wife's left overs in a box. I offered my credit card, to which he replied let me ring up the check.

My fiancee and I always like to have a go-to Pad Thai place wherever we go. This became that place when we found ourselves working in Charlotte. I can honestly say knowing Basil Thai would be around made our recent move to North Carolina even more exciting. Having lived in cities with great food scenes like Chicago, NYC and Boston that should speak volumes for this place. Another notable mention is I've successfully leveraged Basil Thai to change my grandfathers negative perception of Thai food. Big ups.  The Basil Rolls and Pad Thai are our favorite but this place is much more than that. Nothing I've had here have I ever disliked. The service has always been great and the restaurant itself has a modern fresh feel to it. If you are questioning whether or not to eat here, then just stop. Get your reservation now.",

Our server was amazing, it was my first visit so he offered suggestions and kept our glasses full and brought the food out quickly without being overbearing.   My friend and I started with the Thai Chicken Wings. It seems like an unusual start for our dinner but these wings were fantastic. The wings were marinated in soy sauce, garlic and white pepper and then served with fish sauce and Thai chili sauce. The wings were cooked perfectly! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And that thai chili sauce was heavenly! I could have ordered another few to take home!   For dinner I ordered the Red Curry with Chicken and my friend ordered the Basil Tilapia. I'll start with the curry, it was so full of flavor. I loved the combination of coconut milk and red curry. It was just the right amount of spicy and the chicken was so tender! Would I order it again....absolutely! The Basil Tilapia was another excellent choice it's fried tilapia with veggies, sauce and jalapenos (yum!). It smelled sooo amazing when it arrived to the table....the fish was crispy fish and veggies were to such a nice addition in the sauce. My goodness.   Overall, this was an amazing dinner.

Needless to say the appetizer was flavorless, would not recommend. Onto the meal, my dinner partner was still working on the appetizers when they placed his meal in front of him. He did not even have time to look in the pot before they whisked it away- stating they gave him the wrong meal. I then had to eat my dinner alone as he waited. I was done by the time his arrived. No apologies or attempts to make it right. We will not be coming back for poor service and average food.",

    "text": "I had an absolutely HORRIBLE experience at Basil a few weeks back where I was served (and consumed) a plate of food with human BLOOD on it. The staff was dismissive and tried to cover up the fact that a member of the wait staff had a cut on his finger, which was the source of BLOOD on two of the four plates served to my table. They did little to help and I had to follow up with them time and time again to try to get the guy tested so I could ensure that I hadn't contracted anything. AFTER SEVERAL CALLS, they finally ADMITTED that it was in fact BLOOD on my plate. Despite promises to follow up and to have their insurance company call me, the restaurant and its attorney have gone radio silent. To make matters worse, I was pregnant when this incident occurred and they knew that. The experience ruined what used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and the way I was treated was simply offensive and unacceptable. I tried to be both professional and patient and they just simply do not care about customer service or customer health for that matter. This was truly the worst dining experience of my life and I will never be back!",

It took 1 full hour after ordering for us to receive our food which we had to box because it took so long. When we asked to speak to the manager it took her 15 mins to come to our table and all she could offer us was her \"condolences\" and simply apologized. We asked if they could comp the meal since it ruined our coworkers birthday lunch and we were missing a meeting and she declined stating \"that is not our policy\" before adding that we don't have to take the food if we didn't want to pay. That is absolutely unacceptable and blasphemous; we in-turn elected to leave our boxed food at the table out of principle.   The coworker who's birthday it was is a regular at Basil, however I think it's safe to say that none of us will be going back. I will also discourage friends who are interested in choosing Basil as they clearly have no empathy towards their regular customers and are unwilling to accept fault and make things right. Don't waste your time just to walk away hungry!!!",

We bought dinner portions of many items  The coconut chicken soup with mushrooms was excellent. As was the wonton soup.   The basil rolls were good, not great. And they were very small.  The larb was very dry and not at all spicy, which was very disappointing. The pad Thai and the pas see ew were also both dry, and the pad see ew was low on flavor.  We also bought the duck salad, which was decent.  Overall, for the amount we paid, I expected a slightly higher quality of food. Next time I'll likely try a different place for anything other than the soup.",

    "text": "I love Thai food.  It is possibly my favorite cuisine.  But this place doesn't even seem to have half of my favorite dishes.  Am I missing something in calling this place a Thai restaurant?  I asked if it was possible to order off-menu--most authentic chefs can easily whip up a batch of X if it's 100% within-genre.  That was shut down immediately.  For example, pineapple fried rice.  I was told pineapple could be added to the fried rice.  But that's not what makes pineapple fried rice the amazingness that it is.  And, really, who believes that Pad Thai is the national dish?  That's like saying the French actually call the potato product \"French Fries\".  Uh-huh...  So, no way to get 4 stars if I cannot get standard dishes like panang or even yellow curry at a place that considers itself Thai.  But, the maximum three stars are achieved due to (1) the very upscale ambiance--how many real Thai places feel fancy? none!--and (2) that the food was good.    (1) We were seated immediately.  The waiter was such a good sport about \"no ice\" in my water.  Our appetizer plates were removed right away.  We were offered dessert but not in a pushy manner.  When we requested the check, splitting it was offered automatically which was great!  And when I put my cc in the folder and held it up, the waiter came and picked it up in half a second.  The service really was excellent.  But it was cold.  Like really cold.  Like my food got cold before I was even 3/4 done with my meal.  Yeah, that's not cool...  Also, why wasn't I offered chopsticks???   (2) The food was good, but I definitely wouldn't say amazing.  The tofu was good but half of that is because it was fully fried!  I mean, if you fry it, it will taste better, but the dish shouldn't rely on that fact.  The noodles had a nice, chewy texture but still were easy to eat--even after they got COLD!  The broccoli was just the right size and firmness--I didn't have to cut or fight with anything on my plate.  (I got the pad see yew with tofu but next time I'd order it with extra broccoli and a half order of protein or just extra egg.) There was some kind of shredded cabbage mound off to the side of my plate.  I'm not sure why it was there, other than to take up space.  It in no way could have passed for a salad and was too much for a garnish.  That was just a little odd, really.  My friend had the green curry which looked a little watery to me, but I didn't try it.  Also, I didn't see an option or offer for sticky or brown rice.  Looked like just the standard steamed jasmine rice.  I'll have to explore that next time when I do a curry.    Since this place is so convenient, I suspect I'll be ordering take-out or stopping in with co-workers again.  But otherwise, consider me on-the-prowl for real Thai food.  P.S. There were kids at the table next to us.  I'm going to call this place NOT good-for-kids.  The kids seemed miserable--struggled to find something to eat and then to eat it including moments of flailing and lying down (going limp, really) on the seats, the parents seemed harried about it, and the waitstaff was awkward about it.  It was all around unfortunate.",

I usually order panang curry at Thai places but decided to order green curry instead. It turned out to be the same tasting and looking as panang so not sure if it was right but it was still delicious! I got the Thai hot spice and it was very spicy but just what I like. I would recommend going down a notch if you don't like spice. Everyone at the table also enjoyed their meals as well. I tasted a beef dish my friend ordered and the beef was very tender. Not super chewy as it can be sometimes. Already craving this again after writing this review!",

There was a group of 6 of us, so we all came in waves.  Huge bonus...the restaurant seated us without our entire party there.  Score for those of us who showed up early and had extra time to order a round of drinks before dinner!  Our waitress was very nice and thoughtful.  She knew the menu and was able to make some good drink recommendations.  Even when we made some special requests, our waitress and the bar did a great job of getting everything RIGHT.  The drinks were also awesome.  Some of us ordered the specialty drinks while others went off menu, so everything from a fancy martini to a basic gin and tonic were all balanced perfectly.  The food was decent.  I ordered the Basil Chicken.  Lots of veggies, but there wasn't much flavor.  We also got the appetizer platter, which is perfect if you're looking to share with a large group.  Gives you a great sampler of everything, from egg rolls to little fried dumplings.  I highly recommend if you have a late dinner reso and are looking to eat something quickly.  Overall, no one was raving about their food, but no one complained either.  It was A-OK.  I never thought I would rave more about the drinks and atmosphere at a restaurant, than the actual food itself, but there's a first time for everything.",

We went with the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer, potato masaman curry for entree along with the fried rice. All vegan, all appetizing.  The spring rolls are the best I have ever EVER had! One thing I noted that was different is they use tiny vermicelli noodles which are much better suited for spring rolls.  Really fresh, perfectly wrapped.   Masaman curry over white rice was spiced to the right degree.  Vegetable fried rice was good, yet not the highlight of the night after having those rolls.",

I can understand 15 tabs is a lot to keep open for one table, but that policy alone made me want to look elsewhere.  We got to the restaurant and to our surprise, they set us up at 2 separate tables.  The hostess explained that they do not guarantee sitting a party of this size at 1 table.  It would have been nice if they told us that over the phone at time of making reservation.  I asked our waitress if she could arrange us at a single table.  The owner came by and said it could not be done.  After arguing with him for a couple minutes about the fact that there are several open tables available that can be put together to accommodate 15 people, he finally agreed.  He made mention he doesn't know of any restaurants uptown that can accommodate 15 people at one table.  Wow!  I pretty much told him he's full of shit and I would have made my reservation elsewhere had I known it was going to be setup like this.  After setup was complete, the owner came by again and apologized for his temperament.  Anyways, to finish a long story, the wait staff was sub par & not very attentive.  The lunch portions of food have drastically been reduced and now an hour later after lunch I'm already hungry again.  Other than the portion size, the food was good, which was the only reason I gave it 2 stars.  This is a place that seems to have gone downhill, because I've never had such a bad experience previously.",

    "text": "In my quest to plan a very nice evening out as an early Christmas, I finally settled on Basil Thai for dinner reservations after great Yelp reviews, and the delectable menu on their website.  We walked in and I instantly felt like the right choice was made.  The decor, the lighting, and the ambiance of the place were all perfect for what we like.  We also loved the lower seating areas partnered with the large windows allowing us to look at the hustle and bustle of the Saturday night passersby.  We were seated easily and immediately after our drink order was being taken.  The waiter was able to recommend a couple of the local drafts that were available which is always a selling point for me.  The menu was broad and offered a lot.  However, I already had my mind set on the red curry duck going in.  We placed our order (red curry duck and pad thai with shrimp and tofu) and before we were really even able to get into a good conversation, the food was served.  Seriously, the food was served incredibly fast.  I would imagine this is not the standard time it takes but this service was incredibly fast.  The food, in short, was unreal!  The duck was cooked perfectly and it was a very good portion as well.  The curry tasted very nice as a great balance between the sweetness and heat of the spice was struck.  I sampled some of the pad thai as well and the noodles were the best I have had.  I haven't had a ton of noodles as I typically order curries but this plate of pad thai was fantastic.  The food was perfect.  The dinner overall was a complete success.  The drinks were steady, the food was delicious, the service was extraordinary, and the restaurant itself was perfect for the evening.  The fast service allowed us a good amount of time after eating before needing to leave for our next stop which allowed us to have some great dinner conversation which just adds to the already great time at dinner.  I would absolutely come back to Basil Thai again.",

Food - most probably the best Thai in uptown Charlotte. Between the pad Thai and basil chicken, you won't be disappointed. Have tried the vegetable dishes as well and those are delicious.   Service - service is great. Quick, efficient, and helpful. Everything is very clean, bathrooms are nice.",

The place was almost packed when I came but they still managed to sit us at the best area of the restaurant (for me) which was in front of the kitchen. Their kitchen has an open window where you can see how they cook. Observing their movements in the kitchen, I can assure you that food here is really clean and cooked well! Im a spicy food hog and they didnt disappoint my spice level! I would recommend this to everyone who is visiting Charlotte and would want a dose of Thai/Asian food.",

It is even in my top 3 Thai food places and there are some good places in NYC area where I am from.  Some must tries are:   pad see ew: you can choose your protein including Tofu if vegetarian.  pad moon sen:  I love the different flavors and colors of all the topping/veggies.    red curry:  if your into coconut based curry this is a decent choice and u can have a choice of brown or white rice (extra charge for brown rice).    I will be back here a ton and will try new things!  Enjoy!",

Even got to try their egg rolls  Server was very friendly and on-point with beer refills and taking our order.  I do want to mention that they do open for dinner at 5pm and we were puzzled since we couldn't open the door at 5:13pm.  A minute later, the hostess opened the door from inside - apparently we weren't pulling hard enough due to the suction in the room and the wind in the alleyway????  Anyways... I felt like a weakling after finding out it was just a matter of arm strength... but I am glad the hostess let us in so we could have a good meal!",

Basil Thai is on the contemporary-chic side of the dining spectrum.   There is almost always a crowd in the entryway and the spacious dining area is well decorated and inviting. I have been for lunch several times, dinner and gotten take-out- and it's pretty solid. It's not the most authentic Thai but the presentation is pretty and it's always fresh. Service is also good- very enthusiastic and friendly staff.   Glad there's a thai place near my apartment- just a quick walk for green curry or spring rolls is good in my book.",

    "text": "Low stars for the service, food was done well. Midweek lunch with coworkers (party of 5), we were sat immediately.  It took a while after our waters were poured to get the server to come over and he says, \"are you guys ready?\" Uuuhh ok, are you busy?  Do you not care?  Are there specials?  Does anyone want something to drink other than water? I had the pad woon sen (cellophane noodles) with added chicken.  It was flavored lightly, not too heavy on sauce but just right.  Portion was perfect for lunch, veggies crisp.  I loved it!   But let me back up.  It took from the time that we ordered to the time we complained at least 30 minutes, which we mentioned to our server that the two larger tables that got sat after us were already eating.  HE ACTUALLY SCOFFED and said it had not been 30 minutes (it was - my coworker had a meeting right after and he was practically staring at his watch the entire meal), but the kitchen is \"backed up\" so it should be out soon.  I call shenanigans on this guy - I think he screwed up and didn't get the order back to the kitchen.  If they were so backed up how are other people eating??? Wouldn't the entire dining room be at a stand still?? Another issue I had with this guy besides his complete lack of interest in helping us eat in a timely fashion was when he remembered to refill everyone's waters.  Look, I understand you're a big guy and I wouldn't fault anyone for that, but if you KNOW you take up that much space, why wouldn't you pour the water from the right so you don't almost elbow me in my face all three times you reached across me to pour the water into the glass? I hope I don't sound pretentious with that, but you should really see the size of his freakin elbow an inch from your eyeball! Scary Third issue with the server, about halfway into our waiting game, he dropped a covered bowl in the middle of the table with no words and leaves.  Come to find out when we finally got our food, it was actually the rice that goes with the 1 soup that was ordered - we figured this little tidbit out on our own since the server was still giving us the silent treatment.  We were treated to our 1.5 hour lunch so I did not tip, but the visiting New Yorker was pleased to have only paid $60 for 5 meals at lunch (he claims it would be at least $100 in NYC, no doubt).   I'm told the service for the dinner hour is much better and of course larger portions.  I would go back, so long at that dude wasn't my server.",

I arrived about 11:40 on a week day thinking I was going to miss the crowd but the place was quickly filling up and by 12  there was a line out the door.  Fresh Basil Rolls for life please , they were so yummy sucks that you only get two but it's a nice appetizer to share. I tried the Pad See- Eu with shrimp . They give a decent amount of shrimp large helping of noodles but I felt like the broccoli portion could have been a bit better. This was a quick lunch so I wasn't in there for very long but over all a pretty nice Thai place.  It just sucks that its uptown an the parking is the worst but I will definitely be back for dinner !",

Both were great but we didn't get either until about 30 minutes after being seated, our dinner came out slow as well, about another 30 minutes after we finished eating our appetizers. We got the pad thai and it was good, but not any better than you're average pad thai dish from any thai place. We were catching up with friends from out of town so we didn't mind the wait too much, but it might be a problem for others, or it may have just been a busy night. Our waitress was wonderful and very attentive and friendly and apologized on behalf of the kitchen, I can't remember her name but she had dark hair and glasses and made our experience very enjoyable. Overall, the food was good, and I wouldn't be opposed to going back.",

I recommend getting it hot (the perfect amount of spice--don't worry it isnt much still). The basil rolls were also a great way to kick off the meal. I wish I could take a bottle of the sauce that comes with it home!  The style of the restaurant is also great. This isn't your classic asian-style restaurant. It has a nice modern/hip twist on it. I certainly recommend it to any and all that happen to find themselves in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I must say, I loved Basi but that has been ruined recently by a micromanaging and rude owner. The restaurant has a great ambiance and the food is good. My last visit was horrible though. I typically take my team and my clients out to lunch at this location. The wait is a little long and the price isn't exactly cheap. This past visit, I am with a client and she orders a different noodle in her dish. She substituted a cellophane noodle for a flat noodle. The dish was brought out with the cellophane noodle, not what she ordered. We sent the dish back for the correct noodle ordered. This is apparently not cool at Basil. Some random man wearing jeans, cheap tennis shoes, a wrinkled untucked button up, and a cheap basil hat (who was later identified as the owner) comes out and starts quietly yelling at my client; telling her that ordering a different noodle was not allowed and that substitutions are no longer allowed per a new policy on the menu. He wouldn't even let us explain what we wanted, he just spoke over us. He then offered us another dish or the same dish she was originally given or we don't eat, no exceptions where given here even though this was a new policy which no one was aware of. He would have us rather walk out than get what we want. The funny part of this is that the exact same substitution was made the week prior over the phone. I then asked the waitress for a menu and read this \"new\" policy which stated TWO EXCEPTIONS COULD BE MADE PER DISH. The owner stated that changing a noodle wasn't an exception and that it ruined the integrity of the dish. I'm sorry but changing a noodle counts as an exception. This isn't a 5 Star restaurant, I can order what I want when I am paying $15 for a few noodles tossed in a pre-made sauce. I paid $40 for our horrible meal and left angry; the owner didn't even apologize or provide a discount to us. The waitress even said sorry to us and that she didn't believe in the policy. The owner here is a thai food nazi. He doesn't understand customer service and being polite. He will no longer get my business, don't go here if you're trying to impress anyone or like being treated as a guest. I get better service at Chick Fil A.",

We had a large group of 20 people, everything started off great until it was time to pay. We were informed by the restaurant manager that they would only allow us to have 5 separate checks. We were mostly couples with a few singles in the mix and it was much more complicated then if they had just allowed us to have our checks for each couple. The reason behind why they did this was even better: the waiter didn't have enough time to separate the checks on the computer. When I saw at least three managers standing around. I would avoid this restaurant if you have a large group and are not going to be on one tab. Hope it was worth saving the time to give us 5 checks.",

(they even have a banana spring roll dessert that's uncannily like PF's...not that I'm complaining, it's really yummy)  Don't get me wrong, the food was v.good. Summer rolls fresh, pad see ew flavorful and not soggy and overcooked like some Thai places I've been to around CLT.   The manager on duty was always buzzing around...but seemed super down-to-business, and not all that warm. I think I'd be more willing to pay their slightly elevated prices (I say 30% compared to Thai Taste and Dee Jai) if the service was better and the environment more inviting.   Don't forget, noodle dishes originated as street food, costing 75 cents of a dollar. To adapt them into an upscale restaurant, you gotta make it pop to be worth the $!",

In addition to our excellent waitress, I think everyone should know that the entire staff that we came across was exceptional.  We were visiting from Texas and the staff here made us feel completely at home.  Both of the hostesses independently came to check on us during our meal.  The food runner that came to the table was extremely professional, and very nice as well.    I grew up in two family restaurants, and went on to manage many different roles in restaurants outside our family.  In my experience all of this amazing staff, and such a great experience can only lead back to one place and that is good management.    I spoke with Jason, the manager, that evening before we left and my suspicion was confirmed.  He is just as awesome as the rest of his team.

I loved the atmosphere, it was nice without being over the top. We ordered sake for the table. My husband and I had never had sake but we loved it! I can't remember which one we ordered but it was the recommendation of our server, it was an unfiltered option.  We ordered the basil rolls for an appetizer, some with tofu and others with shrimp for the table and they were delicious. The sauce really made them. Tangy and spicy but nothing over the top, a medium spice.  We all tried ordering various dishes so we could each sample them. I ordered the vegetable delight with tofu and a medium spice and was in love. Now that I have eaten there I would easily go to a higher spice because I like spicy food. The medium was really mild to me.  I also sampled the green curry which was really good. I had never had curry before but I really enjoyed it and the flavor was also subtly sweet to me.  We ordered a round of desserts for the table: the chocolate cake, fried banana with coconut ice cream and green tea ice cream. They were all delicious but the table agreed that the fried banana was the favorite. I am pretty sure the banana was wrapped in a springroll wrapper so it had great crunch and completed the ice cream wonderfully.",

I also loved the atmosphere in this place! The kitchen is open to the dining room and the place is has beautiful and unique decorations. I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for quality thai food in a very nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch and wanted to try something new but I don't think I can stray from the pad thai. It's always reliable. I usually get this dish spicy but I think I should have gone wit the \"Thai-spicy.\"  Service was a little on the weak side, however. He seemed pretty new/nervous/slow/alloftheabove and took a while to run the check. Downgrading from 4 stars to 3. I'd come back for another visit, though.",

    "text": "Drove by this location multiple times and finally decided to try it out. Now, Basil has a couple of locations outside of the Charlotte area and I've eaten at their Charleston and Columbia locations before and enjoyed them both very much. Can't say the same for the foods for the Charlotte location.  We ordered the papaya salad (has a weird taste to it, not flavorful and looks creamy -- kind of different to the type of papaya salad I was expecting), Tom yum soup, chicken larb, beef salad and the basil duck.  Out of the 5 items we ordered, only the basil duck was worth the money. It was juicy! Definitely a hit. The rest... I could careless for. Had better at other restaurants and DEFINITELY better at their other locations for which the flavors were much more on point and more \"authentic\". Must be a kitchen differences. It's True that the restaurant has such yummy aroma walking to the place but the foods didn't live up to that hype.   Service was good even though it was a busy Saturday night. It seems like we were the only table in the restaurant that the manager(s) or whoever they were made a point to kept coming back to check on us. Not exactly sure why...but thanks?",

    "text": "Basil has many elements that I enjoy in a good restaurant. Modern, sleek, contemporary, good service, good food and what else; it's Thai.  I appreciate the new age approach, the decor and the upscale bar.The food is pretty decent and as expected with it's locale, prices can be a bit steep.   While Basil is a great addition to the uptown scene, ahem  I do have some constructive criticism to add. Lets talk prices. Lunch is an average of $11+. Now I don't mind paying that much for lunch, just please make it work my while. Portions aren't that large and worst of all, presentation and plating is laughable. How so you say? Well when you're served pad thai, pad see ew, or curry on a small appetizer plate, it kinda gives you a \"wth\" feeling. Is this my full entree? Are the small plates used to \"suggest\" you're getting large portions? Where's the garnish? No cause for concern for what it looks like?   I'm a little perplexed. Presentation is definitely not a deal breaker, but come on Basil, can a feller get a little love? A big plate is aesthetically pleasing to the eye ya know.",
