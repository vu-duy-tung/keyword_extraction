    "text": "During a recent hunger attack while in Rock Hill at an exit where the options left a lot to be desired, we hit Yelp on a search for decent food.  We arrived at Peking Tokyo in the new strip mall in front of a new Wal-Mart.  They did a nice job turning a very basic space into something that didn't evoke cheap strip mall diner. They used giant bamboo for railing, and used nice paint, etc. They have 4 booths and a number of tables, but is a quaint size, allowing service to be active.  It's unusual to mix Americanized Chinese food with sushi at a small restaur, but they do both here so we tried the Peking Tokyo roll and the orange chicken with brown rice. The orange chicken was nice and came with a good amount of perfectly-cooked broccoli.  It was very crunchy, which means it was very fried. Good, but I probably wouldn't order it again b/c of the fried-ness. I might try the moo shu because they said they have the traditional thin pancakes which I haven't seen yet in the CLT area.    However, the Peking Tokyo roll was amazing! Really one of the top rolls in the area! Fresh, flavorful but without relying too much on sauce, spice,  or frying. It was just a solid, excellent, fresh roll. We will definitely be back to try more sushi and wished we had just ordered rolls! My only complaint? I wish they had gone a little lighter on the fish eggs, but that's probably just me.  Bottom line:  Best sushi in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay area and we will definitely be back.",

My husband and I went in for dinner recently and ordered edamame, as well as one roll each. The edamame was fine, the service was great, but unfortunately I have to say that the sushi was just mediocre. I've had much better sushi at other small local places. The variety in the rolls was also just ok. I was bummed... If we want sushi again, I think we will go elsewhere.",

This is essentially a Chinese restaurant that is trying to cater to both the Chinese and sushi crowds. And that is not the right move for them.  I say that because their Chinese food is excellent! I've tried their Hot & Sour soup, their spring and egg rolls, sweet & sour pork, fried rice - the list goes on and on... Thumbs up on all of them!  Now on to the sushi side of things... My wife tried a spicy tuna roll, and did not feel well afterwards at all! So I do not recommend any of it. Stick to the Chinese food here, people!  Service is really friendly, they're usually open late (10pm?) and therefore are a regular take-away option for us as well.  Considering all of the above, I still consider myself a fan. We just stick to their A game...",

The sushi was so clean and fresh tasting, the pieces were giant sized and filled me up.  The prices were great and it was well worth the cost.  I have to say that the sushi is way better than Red bowl and Asian roll and grill and I love the food from both of these places. Hands down sushi was the best from here.  Go and get this awesome sushi give this place the support it needs!!!!!",

I used to say it's kinda like pizza and sex when it's good, it's great and when it's bad it's still good....but hibachi steak and chicken for lunch take out at Peking Tokyo was horrid. Steak burned and a few little chunks. Chicken looked like the fat I cut off and cook for my dog. The veggies were ok, but everything was in some watery broth. It leaked out of the container trying to get it out of the bag. Yum yum (shrimp) sauce was way too small a container. It comes with a salad and soup for lunch which I didn't want or eat. Just really a bad experience.",

The soup is a little skimpy,  a large wonton only had three wontons in it.  The sushi is also not too bad, I got the spider roll and kids had California rolls.  Fried rice is a little weak, not much in it.  It is good though for the price especially when your craving some Asian food.  It's strange though,  no matter what we order whether it's 3 or 5 dinners, it's always the same price, $38.  I think there is only one button on the register.   The pace also gets crowded for lunch time specials.",

I was expecting Peking Tokyo to be another let down but I was pleasantly surprised. When I called to order I told them I just moved into my development and they offered to send plates, cutlery, napkins, and some ice to go along with our sodas. I ordered the chicken and broccoli meal (with rice) and my husband got sesame chicken meal. Both came with egg rolls but I swapped mine out for a small cup of egg drop wonton. The food was FAST! It got to us (piping hot!) within 15 minutes. My chicken in broccoli sauce wasn't greasy and was very fresh. Broccoli was cooked to perfect. My husband loved the sesame chicken he said it wasn't overly breaded and the chicken was all white meat. My egg drop wonton soup great. Some places thicken their soup with something and it almost jello like. Their soup was thin and more naturally thick with egg. The wontons were perfect sized and tasty. The egg roll had this wasabi taste to it though. I wasn't a big fan but my husband who never eats egg rolls loved it. I think it's more of a preference thing so can't hold it against them. I also loved how accommodating they were. They packed us everything we would need to dinner even down the extra cups of ice. Very thoughtful!   This is going to be my go-to delivery! So happy to have good Chinese takeout again!",

I am a Sesame Chicken snob - not too sweet and well cooked.   3. Cleanliness - Bathrooms were clean (a stickler for me), and quite a bit of care has gone into the details of the interior with a nice design.   I really hope Peking Tokyo stays around...good food, friendly staff, clean environment and affordable.   Keep up the good work Peking Tokyo!",

My husband ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and he said it's boring and nothing special. I got the Orange Chicken and asked for it to be extra spicy. Not only was it not extra spicy, it was not spicy period. It was boring and fatty. My son ordered a spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name) and the shrimp was so severely overdone that when I tried it I almost spit it out. My son didn't like the dish, either. My other son got an order of spare ribs. They were terribly, terribly dry. My daughter had a order of friend chicken. She said it tasted fine but didn't love it.   I felt like I would have better off flushing our money down the toilet than paying for that garbage food. Yes, that is a harsh thing to say but it's the complete truth. I hope my review saves you from wasting your money there. I wish I could write a good review because the people who work there are really nice.",

    "text": "I'm with NP, this place is average at best and I am surprised by the rave reviews as well - so I'm giving it a Meh 2 star review.  As we just moved to another south Charlotte area, we decided to get on the hunt for a Chinese restaurant.  As close as this one is across the border, sadly this will not be the one.   I typically order sesame chicken when I go to Chinese restaurants and it was no different here.  While the presentation is A+, the taste was not as flavorful as other restaurants we have gone to.  I was also disappointed that they put the broccoli on the side instead of letting it soak up the sauce and other flavors, so instead you get bland steamed broccoli.  The sauce was also very thick around the chicken, so there was nothing extra to pour ontop of the rice or let the rice soak up the sauce either.  I am not sure what Kevin ordered, some chicken dish.  Now the veggies in here were nice as they soaked up the sauce and flavor very well.  I think the only complaint is when Kevin has typically ordered this dish elsewhere, it is mild, and here it was very spicy.  Nice little quiet restaurant, but we will try somewhere else.",

I stopped in right before the lunch rush. There is nothing fancy on the inside, a couple of tables and booths but the staff is friendly and the service is very fast.   They have a GREAT lunch menu, plenty of variety with a small price tag of $5.25. I went with the shrimp and broccoli, steamed rice and egg roll (you have the choice of soup or egg roll).   Before I knew it my food was ready, I asked if I could have some wontons and sweet sauce and they very happily put some in my bag. Boy was I in for a treat, no itty bitty shrimp here! They were nice plump, full size shrimp. The brown sauce and crispy texture on the broccoli was delicious. The steamed rice was sticky goodness, loaded up with soy sauce and mixed all together....perfect! I loved it!   This is definitely some good Chinese food. Best thing, it's freshly prepared per order so everything comes out nice and hot. Good stuff here!   Do yourself a favor...give this place a try!",

Also Thai basal chicken with noodles. Oh my god I don't know where to begin it was so bad. Let's start with the service the man at the register is rude. He is not welcoming at all just take your Order and be done with you. When I got my order and the bag was all stapled a young lady handed me my bag of food and said is there anything else I said yes hot oil please. Just in enough year shot for the mad to rush over and scold the lady for going to go get me hot oil and it was in the bag. It's not her fault she did not know she was just trying to service me. Now on to the food I have never tasted hot and sour soup with no flavor st all. I had to Come home and add some seasoning just to make it edible. Next I tried the Mongolian bees with fried rice, The taste was sour and the meat disolved in my mouth. Obviously this is not beef. I found hair not only in my soup but also in my basil chicken. The basis chicken which was supposed to be this came with lomein noodles which should have been my first warning sign which I had to pay a $1.50 extra for the noodles. Next the dish itself had so much basil that you could taste noting else. This is the worst experience and if I could give negative stars I would, will not be going back.",

Peking Tokyo made all of these items the best and they always have great customer service. They also have brown rice which was hard to find.   This is one of those \"American\" style Chinese restaurants that everyone is used to, but it's great. They also have some Thai and Japanese dishes, but I prefer sticking to the Chinese. I have gone for sushi on occasions and enjoyed it. The space is a little small to dine in, but It's cozy and has Chinese artwork on the wall. Also when you dine in, they give you some fried wonton chips and sweet chili sauce to dip it in.   The food is awesome and tastes less greasy than others. Presentation for dining in is always gorgeous and portions are huge. They have combinations that come with rice and an egg roll for lunch and dinner. Some of my favorites are Mongolian chicken, Hunan chicken, lo mein, chow mei fun and sesame chicken.   On my most recent trip, I got a wonton soup and roast pork lo mein. Their wonton soup is not overly salty and has a nice mild flavor. Two wonton come in a small and four in a large. I also always get this when I'm sick. The egg roll is large, nice and crispy and has savory cabbage and vegetables inside. The roast pork lo mein has a slightly sweet flavor, crisp (not overcooked) vegetables, very tender roast pork and tender noodles to soak it all up.   This is a great family-owned business. I've never had a bad experience. It's simply the vest Chinese in Fort Mill.",

My wife came in from yoga and took them up on the drink.   Now for the meal.   My orange chicken left a lot to be Desired. Lots of orange taste, which was nice, but not spicy at all and the breading seemed to turn into mush.  The roast pork fried rice, I felt was dry and lacking flavor.

Then she rushed us to order. When we had questions about the menu she said, \"I don't know what you're talking about. It is what it is.\" I ordered the Pineapple fried rice and it was AWFUL!!! Canned chicken, frozen peas, carrots and pineapple chunks in instant rice.  My colleague ordered a spicy tuna roll and after one bite, she was ready to go. We left our full plates and got out of there as quick as we could! To top it off, they gave me half a fortune cookie (it was packaged but looked like it had been bitten off of) with the fortune fully readable from outside the packaging. We are SHOCKED that this place had such a great Google/Yelp review! Never again...",

They do serve some Japanese and Thai dishes but I just get the Chinese menu items . $6 for lunch specials that are a good portion , and quick .  I like that the food is not greasy, and there are tons of options .   Now I'm not saying this is mind blowing Chinese food, I'm saying it's great service, which if you read my reviews I absolutely will appreciate , and the food is good . Not overly salty, not heavily oiled , and not bland . Can't count how many times we've grabbed a quick lunch on the go , but I haven't had one negative experience .",

    "text": "Situated in Fort Mill, this restaurant is a drive away from Charlotte. Entering inside you get a feeling of an intricately decorated Japanese restaurant but once you see the walls, the size of the small room becomes reality and turns you claustrophobic at times. The menu was quite a large menu with lots of the regular Japanese usuals and a good variety sushi as well. We went for the regulars, General Tso chicken and fried rice. Our waitress was very friendly and brought us some tempura fries and sweet sauce. We also asked for an extra bowl of the tempura and she was glad to bring us one.   We didn't wait long for our order, and everything was hot and fresh. The quantity was huge and plentiful. It wasn't the neither best tasting dish nor too bad. It's also incredibly inexpensive for a Japanese dine in restaurants.  Though Peking Tokyo doesn't offer the best dining experience, it's still worth a try for the friendly service, budget pricing and large quantities of good food!",

My husbad ordered the combination of General Tsos, plain fried rice,  eggroll (it was vegetarian, cabbage only) and many broccoli pieces. This was just ok for me but my husband liked it very much.  Again the heat level was very low.  The wantan  soup was ok made with  light broth  (I don't like dark broths).

The fried rice has lots if stuff in it ( peas, carrots, bean sprouts and what ever protein you chose).   Overall, it's enjoyable food.

I cannot believe that none of the dishes had any flavor except the Tako Su, which I believe had wasabi mixed in the extremely oily sauce, which for Tako Su should not have been oily and the octopus was rough and really hard to find, for Tako Su that's a feat considering that is supposed to be the main ingredient.  I come from NY where we would order 'real' Chinese on a regular basis. I was so disappointed I had to call the restaurant just to let the owner know, maybe he didn't taste the food, who knows.  All I know is that we will never go back ever.  I wonder if those rave reviewers have damaged tastebuds???",
