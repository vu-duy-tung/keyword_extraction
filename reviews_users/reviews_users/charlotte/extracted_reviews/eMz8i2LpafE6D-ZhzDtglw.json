    "text": "I reluctantly review this place, because I want small businesses to succeed, and despise chain restaurants.  But honest, I must be.  Since I live close by, I had seen a \"Coming Soon\" banner draped on the side of the restaurant for a while.  Can't wait for it to open!  Sadly, my dinner here was a big disappointment.  The very young server took our order, and five minutes later returned to take our order again.  Sweet mistake, I suppose.  Unfortunately, the food sucked.  I had the shrimp ceviche, which was downright awful.  The main combo platter was huge; called Bandeja Paisa, it consisted of a grilled steak, egg sunny side up, pork belly, spanish sausage, rice and beans, ripe plantains, avocado, and corn cake.  With the exception of the fried egg, everything else must've been leftovers from last night!  Dried meat, tasteless and chewy.  I do hope this place gets its act together.  After all, it just recently opened and is probably finding its footing.  It is very encouraging to see ethnic restaurants open in Ballantyne, or Charlotte for that matter.  So I am rooting for this place, and I hope you forgive me for the 1-star review.  Perhaps a return visit in the near future will change my rating of this place.  Good luck, Pio Pio!",

This is a Peruvian restaurant but the menu does well explaining what all the dishes are in case you are not what to order. The waiter was very friendly and the price was not bad at all.  For under $50, it would be easy to feed a hungry family of 4. So if you are in the mood to try something different, this place will not let you down.",

    "text": "Just got back from having lunch at Pio Pio.  I was excited to have some Lomo Saltado for lunch and I headed to Pio Pio for the first time since it got good reviews on Yelp.  I try to be fair with my reviews and I'll do the same here......  I was very disappointed with my experience at Pio Pio today.  Upon arriving a little before Noon, I noticed there was only one big party of at least 10 people seated.  A waiter showed me to my seat and quickly got my drink and took my order.  The place is clean and pretty nice.  The waiter brought out two dipping sauces.  One was pretty spicy and the other was a little milder.  I liked them both, so it was cool.  Shortly thereafter, my favorite Peruvian dish was brought out, Lomo Saltado!!  Man, I love this dish!!  At least the one I used to get at Misti's in Port Chester, NY.    Simply put..... The dish is made up of fries, rice (usually white, but they served it yellow) topped with beef strips sauteed in onions and tomato.  The problem with the dish is that it was literally tasteless!!  I mean, I poured some salt and pepper on it and it simply tasted like.................. nothing.  I poured some of the dipping sauces and this at least added some heat to the dish.  I was very dissapointed to say the least.  I don't compare it to what I used to get in NY because I know every restaurant uses different seasoning, but c'mon man!!  :).  I will give this place another try though..... I know Peruvian Pollo a la Brasa is very good, so I will eventually go back and try their chicken, but I don't plan on ever getting the Lomo Saltado again.",

We have carried many friends there who also enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  Today we went there for dinner to discover a sign out front indicating new ownership. Inside once we asked about it we were told that this location and the East Blvd location are now under the same Ownership, and that prior owners had gotten into trouble with kitchen inspections.  They indicated we would love the food that it was tremendously better.  Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  I had pork chops and they came to me and were end cuts, taste old, and were about 1/4 inch thick.  I also had beans and yucca.  To say the food was salty is an understatement, it was like taking the top off the salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth,  I wish I were exaggerating.  Oh yes did I mention their prices were about 40 % higher also?  What a waste of $40.",

The wait was a little long but the portions were great for $35. we fed 16 people for $230  The delivery of the orders was a little confusing, but we figured it easily.  Each portion could feed 2 to 4 people. Three of us men got together and paid the bill and I gave the servers a 60 dollar tip  The taste was good enough for me to want to come back. We will try the Dilworth location next time as it is closer to our home. My recommendation if you like chicken this is a nice place to get something tasty",

Don't ask me how they can have the same name but if you Google Pio Pio Charlotte, the one in Dilworth has a totally different website.  I dine at the Dilworth Pio Pio regularly & it's delicious. Don't let this place deter you from trying it.  I recommended a friend try this new location & told her exactly what to order. They seemed a little confused which I thought was weird. I called Dilworth just to make sure it was the same owners & was told the Lancaster Hwy location is different owners (I asked how they could have the same name but the person didn't know). Then called Lancaster Hwy & asked if they're the same Pio Pio as in Dilworth & they guy replied, \"It's the same food\"...I said, no I want to know if it's the same owners. He said yes. I don't believe that, especially based on the reviews here.  I did some further research & it appears Pio Pio is a franchise so that explains the name. But based on the reviews I won't be trying the other location.",

My favorites are the guacamole and tostones, chicken soup and the rice. Each of these things I could eat over and over again and not get tired of. Before coming here, I never had guacamole with tostones. I am a big fan of guacamole in general, but I had never tried to eat it with anything other than chips. I must say the tostones are delicious and give a pleasant chewiness that chips don't have. Also, the chicken soup is very flavorful! I love soups of all kind, but I usually think chicken soup is boring. Not this one! All the different ingredients like the plantains, corn and cilantro work well together and make it more unique than your standard chicken soup.",

I chose the 1/4 roasted white meat chicken. This comes with yellow rice and red beans with a side for $9.50 at lunch.  For $1 more, I substituted black beans for the red beans.  I chose sweet plantains as my side dish.   The chicken was absolutely delish! It was juicy and flavorful. The yellow rice was a bit on the bland side, but tasted better when eaten with the black beans, which were seasoned nicely.  The plantains were yummy. I didn't try the garlic sauce, but the jalepeno sauce was tasty - not a lot of bite, but nice flavor.     Our service was ok... not outstanding but adequate. Overall, I was quite pleased with my meal and my co-workers enjoyed theirs as well.  I am looking forward to going back.",

The rude gestures came from a male also working at the restaurant (was at the front counter most of the time), when he started insulting my guests stating, \"can you not read?\" and other inappropriate remarks.         I enjoyed the food I had (#4) and I was looking for catering options for an event in Charlotte.  I asked if an exception could be made since we were wanting to be returning customers, the male worker said he'd ask the manager... turns out the manager was only on the phone and was a very quick phone call.       Decided to go to this location since it was closer than the Dilworth chain. (rude gentleman worker said that both locations are owned by same person.  is this True?)   I will definitely not be coming back or doing any business with this restaurant again.  I do not recommend dining in at Pio Pio.",

    "text": "I went there for lunch time with a co-worker and it was a little busy, so I decided to order my food to go. However, after about 2mins I realized that all the people in front of me were actually one group, so I asked the server how long it would take to be seated and he said about the same amount if I take it to go. So I said we will just dine in then. After waiting about 30mins to be seated, they bring all food in the boxes still and serve us at the table. I said can the food be put in plates? The server replied \"Since you ordered your food 'To Go' it's still in boxes\" and then just walked away. Since we didn't have that much time left for lunch, we just decided to eat really quickly so we could get back to work. But this was very disappointing and somewhat offensive, as I don't think I should even have to ask that question in the first place. The whole point of dining-in is so that you can sit down and enjoy your meal at the whichever restaurant you go. It was very awkward to be eating out of boxes when everyone else had plates, etc...   The second issue I had, was after I finished eating I asked for a glass of water (I didn't order anything to drink initially). Right after I asked for my water, about 3 groups finished eating and went to pay at the same time. So, instead of getting my water the server started to ring up every single person in line. And it seemed like they were all paying separately.   So not only did I have to eat of of boxes like an animal or neglected step children, compared to everyone else, I was neglected again and had to wait for everyone else to be tended to first. I ended up just walking out and just got some water when I got back to work. And for the record the manger was the one that brought out our food in the boxes. So he was very much aware of it.  For these two reasons I give one star. The food is good, but I felt somewhat neglected and not appreciated as a customer.",

Mainly, the food was solid - I had the chicken soup which was flavorful and quite good w yucca, chicken and a half corn on the cob. Accompanying rice, avocado and plantains were excellent . Companions had snapper (warning! Whole fish served fried!) which was a bit salty but still good. Sampler platter was heavy on meat - could've skipped this one.   The service was shaky, mainly because our young server was clearly not fluent in English and not experienced managing multiple tables in a busy restaurant. He was pleasant however, as was the host and any billing errors were sidestepped because a different person processed our check. I'd recommend anyone on the fence to at least give this place a shot.",

Have plenty of friends who rave about the Latin fare so we expected good things. While I can say the food was interesting, flavorful, and unique, the service was a little lackluster.   We ordered a few apps: Corn cake, cheese empanadas, and the cold potato dish. The corn cake was rather bland and slightly burnt, but if you add either of their hot sauces it turns into magic. The empanadas are pretty standard and nothing groundbreaking. The potato dish is where our interest was focused. Such an interesting cheese and cream sauce that was slightly spicy, subtle and odd all at the same time. I think the temperature is what made it so interesting. Would recommend this to anyone.   My entree was a little confusing. It was a rice dish....that literally was fried rice...I was a little curious since there is an Asian restaurant next door, but laughed it off. Just a bit odd to taste something like this from a Latin place.   The service was also really spotty. Not too attentive for a Saturday evening. Drinks were a bit low throughout most of the meal, but not a huge deal. All in all, I'd come back, but would most likely look to visit the other location on East.",

My party of 4 was seated immediately and out waiter introduced himself as soon as we were seated and took our drink orders. Seems like good service so far, right? Yeah, that's what we thought but once we received our drinks... We didn't see our waiter again until we were halfway through our meal (another waiter brought our food to the table).   As a general observation, this location would do alright if they increased their staff... There were 2 waitresses serving approximately 15-18 tables (not sure how many cooks were working the kitchen)... this included taking call-in orders and cleaning the tables when parties left. For a Saturday evening, that's not good staffing for a place with such great food (of course the place is going to be packed).   If I'm in the area, then I will not count this place out but I will probably go with the Dilworth location over this one, given a choice.",

Same with the sides, the yucca fries are just a big french fries, their salads could use fresher lettuce and more vegetables.  Customer service wasn't the best either, they used to give you the house sauces (they're not great, but you need something to give your food some sort of kick) from behind the counter, now it's \"do it yourself\" and that took some time to put together.

It was a Thursday, and empty for the most part, but the food was great. The service was attentive and friendly, with enthusiastic recommendations. I tried the rotisserie chicken, beans, rice and tostones. Everything was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The game changer is the green hot sauce. If you can handle heat, just pour it into your rice and prepare for greatness. Another friend enjoyed the same dish I had, with plantains. She loved it. And my other friend tried the skirt steak. I have to try it next time! It looked awesome.   Pio Pio is great for a quiet dinner or delicious take out! I'll definitely keep coming back!",

We were greeted by a friendly staff member who promptly seated us in an otherwise empty restaurant....three other diners.   After perusing the menu, we asked a number of questions and made our decisions. My Bride and I both ordered the rotisserie chicken. She ordered her bird with fries and a side salad.  I ordered the beans & rice, the ripe plantains, fried yuca and tostones.  Our server was patient and informative and made our experience satisfying.  Our chicken was a generous portion of flavorful moist chicken (white meat).  The salad and fries weren't notable nor were the beans and rice. The ripe plantains were flavorful and moist. The fried yuca was bland except for the dipping sauce which could jazz up a hockey puck. The tostones were equally unmemorable except for the dipping sauces.  The staff is welcoming and helpful, the chicken flavorful and moist and the side......just sides but worth a try!",

I asked him about Happy Hour and he seemed to have no idea what I was talking about.   The female server didn't even TRY to pretend like she cared. My simplest requests seemed TO. TAKE. SO. MUCH. EFFORT. Really. I haven't seen this level of apathy in a long, long time in a restaurant settting. These people clearly do NOT like their jobs and it makes me wonder what is going on with the restaurant if wait staff can be THIS miserable - especially when only two customers are in the place, and so many others have also commented on the poor service? Unhappy employees are usually a reflection of poor management.  The food was OK. I was a little shocked that when I asked for chimichurri sauce I was given a bowl of the stuff, charged $2.50, and it contained jalapeno peppers. I lived and studied in Peru (and have spent time in other Andean countries), and have never seen jalapenos in anything. The breaded chicken breast was thin, bone dry and utterly devoid of flavor. The rice was decent. The yuca fries were dry and bland.   Pio Pio, I hope you figure out your issues. Especially why your staff is so miserable. We couldnt wait to get out of there tonight.

I have been to this restaurant menu times before and even though they've never been the friendliest of people they were completely rude this evening.  My family and I sat down and waited for our waiter but one never came out until I asked 'Do we have a waiter?' and 2 minutes later this woman came out who already had a terrible attitude.  We placed our order right away as we have been here many times and already know what we like from the menu and we sat and waited for close to 15-20 mins before our food came out. This probably doesn't sound too bad except typically our food is ready in less than 10 mins after ordering in the past. I asked the waiter ' is there a problem?' and I received a snipe response..'the food is coming' in a very unprofessional way.  Lastly, right before leaving, I asked for the owner's name and how to get a hold of him...\"His name is Ryan but he's in and out and we never know when he'll be here but you can try calling the other location and ask for him\". This was the most dismissive response I've ever received from someone who clearly doesn't care at all whether I'm a dissatisfied customer or not. I did try calling the other location but, surprise surprise, the number displayed (704-379-1911) doesn't work... It rings and rings and no one ever answers. I guess if I was an actual customer trying to place an order I'd be out of luck.  Ryan, if you're reading this, please know that you have lost a customer - not because of your food, which is excellent, but because of the very very bad staff and service you have at the Ballantyne location. Please do something about this ASAP",

I've already been there three times this week and I just discovered it on Tuesday. The yelp photos and reviews just don't do it justice. The place is very clean, open with good ambiance and has outdoor seating. They also have a full bar and TVs. Seems like a good place to be if you're looking for some good food and to possibly catch a buzz.  The food is fantastical. I love the chicken soup and arroz con pollo. The soup has a great broth and is always packed with veggies like corn and potatoes, plus plantains. The chicken is tender and moist and they sprinkle fresh cilantro on top. Mmmm. The arroz con pollo is what really rocks though. If you've never had peruvian, this is a great beginner's dish. I just love it because it's one of my comfort foods. They give you a good portion of rice, mixed with veggies and shredded chicken. It's seriously so good. Even kids will probably like it. Drizzle some of the green sauce on top for a kick...but beware, that stuff is potent.   The service was also really good. The staff is very attentive and they even let me switch out fries for soup with my entree.   If you're in Ballantyne, try this place. You'll love it.",

    "text": "Came here for an early dinner on a Saturday with my husband.  There were 2 employees inside.  One was having a meal and the other eventually greeted and seated us.  We knew exactly what we wanted so we got right to it. Ordered rotisserie chicken, white meanlt only, tostones, salad, rice and beans and a veggie plate.   The food came out soon after but the waitress forgot the salad but noticed that on her own and she came back with it shortly. The chicken was amazing.  Definitely would come. Back for that. The tostones were good but a little too much on the thin crispy side like chips.  I'm used to them being more thick and less crispy on the ends,  so they are a consistent sauce absorbing tiny cake. The rice and beans were yummy and so was the salad. The salad ingredients were pretty decent:  avocado,  and your basics. The veggie plate was OK but not something I would order again.  It was like a spiced bag of peas,  carrots and green beans.  Also,  a small plate is huge,  so don't get a large unless a whole family is sharing.   Each table had a container of green sauce and white sauce. The sauces werw delicious was went very well with the food. I liked that we didn't have to ask for more sauce because we had so much at the table already.  The service was mehh.  Our waitress had a friend visiting so she went and sat down with this friend for a while so we didn't really get the attention we needed. We also asked for a napkin at one point and she said she would bring it, but didn't provide one at all and left again letting the other employee attend to us part of the way.  Then she would come back to wrap things up with us but non-attentively.",

Yes, we went in 30 minutes before closing because we were hungry, wanted something close by and wanted to try a new restaurant. Pio Pio did not disappoint. We sat outside on the patio so they could still clean and get ready to close down. Service was friendly, helpful and professional. They answered our questions, made suggestions and even let us try some complimentary empanadas. And yes, they were piping hot and delicious! I favored the chicken one over the beef.  We ordered the sampler platter, the bistec (steak) dinner with rice, beans and plantains, coconut shrimp, chicken, and Jalea (Peruvian seafood platter topped with onion, tomato & lime juice! EVERYTHING was piping hot, fresh and well seasoned! Even at closing time.  My top 3:  The Jalea, which is a must try. So fresh and the onion, tomato, lime juice is absolutely necessary to bring it to the next level.  The juicy rotisserie chicken with the spicy green sauce was absolutely divine. And to round out my top 3 was the chicharron on my sampler platter.  I absolutely can not wait to go back and eat here again. Fingers crossed that they deliver again and again and again!

Running a kitchen and handling other people's food should be just plain common sense - - the golden rule applies here \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". Commonsense when handling other peoples' food should be the easiest thing in the world.

    "text": "Quite frankly, this unassuming little Latin American joint serves up the best rotisserie chicken in Charlotte (and yes, I mean the BEST, which I rarely say about anything - check my record!) Their two housemade dipping sauces only add to its glow, just beware the light green one as it is jalapeno based. The servers warning that it is indeed hot should not go unheeded.   Although my wife and I have dined here dozens of times, I can provide only one recommendation but it's all you need. Order the quarter chicken with rice, beans and plantain. All the sides are fantastic but in particular, the plantain is perfectly fried and caramelized. My only other strong recommendation is to add a side salad for $3.50. It is always crisp, refreshing and comes crowned with freshly sliced avocado, all lightly doused with its delicious in house vinaigrette. We enjoy it as much as we enjoy the chicken.  The sanitary rating is always in the very high 95s and the atmosphere is quaint and comfortable. One important note however, if they happen to be playing hip-hop or rap just ask them to change it to the traditional Latino music. It's amazing how that can either add or detract from your overall experience.  Now about the service... Yes, it can be sketchy but most of the time it is very friendly and attentive. Don't tell them, but even at its worst, I'm a return customer. This place is a Gotta Try.",

My entree was breaded steak, tostones,  rice and beans. The steak lacked a flavor, but it may be because Peruvians use lots of sauces as compliments with their cuisine. The beans and rice were very tasty.  My wife ordered the grilled steak, maduros and rice and beans. Once again the steak lacked flavor. In our opinions.

While stationed in D.C. in the mid-90s I would always visit a Peruvian joint in Arlington VA for the best chicken.  It would always come off the flame juicy and hot!.  I have noticed a few Peruvian chicken places popping up around Charlotte lately.  I visited another larger chain and was a little disappointed.  The chicken was okay but combined with the price, I was let down.  Pio Pio is on point!  Price is great and the portions are huge. There are only two of us so we had a whole other meal left over...except for the beans.  Those didn't last.  Why do you ask?  Because they are freaking A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!!  Next time we order we are ordering extra beans.  The fried yuka was good and the plantains were cooked perfectly. Just soft enough but not too mushy.  I definitely recommend trying the Latin Combo.  (This is what we ordered). You get a whole chicken, a gorgeous salad, yellow rice (oh em gee), fried yuca, plantains and those delicous beans!!!  Uber Eats had it to us in about 25 minutes and only charged us $2.99 surcharge. Not too bad. Total bill was about $35 with tip.",

Need to go back to the drawing board and define their flavors and identity. Price didn't quite justify the portions. As far as service, I can say they tried. The place has potential, it's fairly new. Give it a try an you be the judge.",

    "text": "After reading some of the other reviews I was a little concerned when my dad suggested we visit Pio Pio in Ballantyne. I think they maybe have read these reviews and got their stuff together a little more. I didn't have any issues when i went.  The restaurant was a little small with about 20 tables. It was cute and cozy with some great spanish music playing. From time to time i found myself dancing in my seat.   My parents ordered one of the combo specials with chicken, yucca, rice and beans. The chicken was tender and tasty. My family absolutely loved the beans and even ordered seconds. The second order of beans was delivered by the owner shortly after ordering it. He made sure we were being well taken care of.  I ordered the arroz con pollo with plantains and was a little disappointed but only becauseIi was comparing it to my mom's. It was definitely tasty but at times i felt like I was on an Easter egg hunt. With every fork full of rice i would find a new ingredient such as green beans, or vienna sausage looking things, or corn. It was certainly an interesting meal.The plantains were sweet and delicious.   I think i would go back if i was hungry for some tasty chicken.",

    "text": "My first, and most likely the last time coming to this place. Unlike some other reviews, I did not have an issue with rudeness of the staff. But my pet peeves are  other customer service related issues, like WiFi access. I am trying to connect to the locked signal, I asked my waitress (Ruby) for the password, and she said she doesn't know. She said it's for the credit card machine only. Seriously??? Com on!!! What place in Ballantyne does not have a free WiFi now days. If the Sam's clubs, McDonalds and grocery stores have it, why wouldn't they.....anyway, like I said, my little pet peeves. Decor was inviting. I thought it could have been little busier for a lunch, perhaps if it was run differently. For lunch, food was little bit on the expensive side. Most dishes are above $10. I know that prices are going up in that direction, but most places are trying to still keep the numbers in single digits. Food was decent, but the whole experience does not deserve double digit price. As for my dish, lunch menu item #2, chicken soup with plantain, rice and avocado. The combination just didn't work for me. Individually each item tasted OK, but I was not sure what to eat with what. Perhaps I just don't understand Peruvian food. Too much cheap starch. Soup was little on the salty side, with few pieces of chicken, potato and yucca. Than, once I am done with soup, eating bland rice with plantain was like eating a white bred with doughnuts. I suppose that avocado was there to bring some color on the plate. Another detail, my pet peeve (as I get older, I get more and more of those - old fart) avocado vas not even taken out of its shell. I see that as not very hygienic, especially when the the shell still had a PLU sticker on it. It was probably taken out of the box, never washed, cut in half and put on my plate. Maybe it was washed, but the way it was presented to me in the plate, I am tempted to believe that it was not. Serving avocado in a shell, to me spells lazy, sloppy an not creative. If it was taken our of the shell, they might have gotten one more star. I ask myself, should be going there again? I can only answer that with another question...why? So many other choices...",

    "text": "Recently my next door neighbors, my wife and myself had dinner at the Ballantyne location. My neighbors had eaten there a few times before, but it was our first time. It was also my first time dining at a \"Peruvian\" restaurant. I ordered some Tostones with guacamole, shared it with my wife. I'm choosy about my guacamole and I was not let down. It was 5 star guacamole. My main dish consisted of strips of beef mixed with brown rice, bits of mushroom and onion. This was an ideal dish for me in that it contained ingredients that I enjoy all the time. I liked the tostones, too. They're fried Plantains although the taste reminded me of potato- nothing wrong with that. The food was all just great, however there are problems with the service. The servers seem to be very young, inexperienced in their work and also in the English language. I paid by credit card and when they came out to give me my bill, they said that my Visa was not being accepted. I automatically assumed that I had done something wrong with my Visa card that I had just used at a gas station hours before. So, I leave there with a \"block\" on my Visa card because the young and inexperienced server(s) did not run the credit card properly. So, expect great food, pay in cash, and learn a few words in Spanish before you go. Return visit to Pio Pio April 15, 2014.   Returned to Pio Pio this past Wednesday. Again the star of the show was Guacamole! I ordered a breaded chicken dish which was tasty but a bit dry. I did not find any decent sauce to put on it. Service this time was better and I avoided complications that may have arisen with my Visa card by paying in cash.",

The young lady proceeded go tell me that I didn't say I wanted white meat but she would fix it for 75 cents more. She then proceeded to tell the cook that I didn't ask for white meat. She was nasty from the beginning. If Pio Pio wants to be successful at this location as they are in Dilworth the need a staff over haul. I'd rather drive 30 minutes for better customer service.",

Then I wanted a Jalea anyone that has had these before.. they are suppose to come with Calamari, shrimp and other seafood items. This restaurant only offers fish and calamari. So I decided to go with Ceviche. What was that for the fish tasted old, had no lemon flavor.. no red onions in it and the piece of sweet potato in it was a joke! My husband ordered a lomo saltado thinking they cant cook that wrong. well it was bland had no flavor it was HORRIBLE.. Worst $30.00 I ever spent. Then when I got home I was super sick throwing up, full blown **STOMACH VIRUS** all weekend!!! I have been trying to get a hold of the owner since Saturday morning. Since the manager of the store says they cant make decisions on refunding customers. Still no luck! DON'T SPEND YOU $$ ON THIS FAKE PERUVIAN RESTAURANT!!",

Lack of customer service, no greeting, no interest, no follow up, drinks left empty for half the meal.  I do not think they have hired one experienced server yet!

    "text": "I love the concept of Pio Pio but have to agree with previous reviews. There is definitely room for improvement.  We ordered a combination of things to get a feel for what they offered. We tried the Mofongo with pork. It was tasty but on the dry side.  I went for the half chicken which was okay. I could taste a slight marinade of garlic and some citrus and it had a good golden color but it probably could have stood to marinate longer. My meal also came with a corn cake which is called an arepa and it was slightly burnt on the outside and bland and dry on the inside. They may benefit to take it off the menu until they can improve that recipe.    The actual show stoppers are their sides and sauces. I went bananas over their beans and rice,  chicken soup, and those little containers of sauce you get to dip the chicken in are garlicky, spicy, and perfect. They pretty much saved the meal which is a shame for the chicken that is supposed to be the star player.    As for our service, it was good but we went during a slow period iin the middle of the day. We met the owner and found him to be very charming and a great host.  So all in all I am not rushing back to Pio Pio but I would definitely return being more conservative with my meal selection. I am certainly rooting for their success.",
