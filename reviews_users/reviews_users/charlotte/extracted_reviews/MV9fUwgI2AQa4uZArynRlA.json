I have been coming here for years and every dish I have tried has been awesome. If you're a huge fan of cheese like I am then I recommend ordering a vegetarian dish. Instead of meat on the items they replace it with a ton of cheese. =) They also have drink specials almost every day and of course you get unlimited chips and salsa.",

It's not worth the $10 you'll spend on a meal to miss a day of work. On top of that, the waitress didn't give me the correct change after I paid. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.",

    "text": "I was a late add-on to my party tonight as I got an invite to dinner after the rest of the party already sat down. When I arrived, I sat about 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. I was not offered a menu, or asked if I wanted a drink, and it was not acknowledged that a 3rd person was now sitting at our table. After those 10 minutes passed, one of the other girls got up and retrieved a menu from the un-manned hostess stand, and brought it back to me. It was at this moment that a server asked me if I wanted a drink menu. He handed it to me, and left me to pore over it for about 5 more minutes. I finally stopped him to ask him for a glass of water and a sex on the beach. The water came out, and he began to scurry away. At this point, the other two members of my party were receiving their plates, and while he was setting their food down I asked if I could order. I ordered a taco salad. The food came out only about 3 minutes after my drink, which I ordered long before. The service was slow, the plates were dirty, and silverware/straws needed to be requested before you received them. I was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment. The beef was bland, the pico had an awkward taste to it that I couldn't pinpoint, and it was nothing that would make me come back a second time. I guess it's time to try another Mexican place in Ballantyne.",

    "text": "While living in California I gained a newfound appreciation for Mexican food.  With many excellent taquerias and authentic establishments to choose from, I overcame my prejudice of Mexican food as bland combinations of rice, beans and tomatoes.  When done correctly, it's pretty damned delicious.  Now that we've moved to Charlotte, I figured that finding a decent carnitas taco or pollo con chorizo would be a challenge.  Would you believe that we lucked out on the first try?  Monterrey was just that good.  As the other reviews have mentioned, like any good Mexican restaurant you are first served with a heaping pile of tortilla chips, salsa and the infamous white cheese dip.  Order a beer (Bohemia is always the best) and a main dish, and you'll be off and eating within 5 minutes.  Service was excellent, and the food was totally on point.  My carne asada was grilled to perfection, topped with a grilled jalepeno and served with great rice and refried beans.  The guacamole salad had a little bit of spicy kick to it, yet the sour cream helped tone down the spice of the dish.  Is this place authentic?  I have no idea, probably not.  Is it a hike from uptown?  Yeah.  The best ethnic food is almost never downtown.  Long story short, we will be going back to Monterrey Mexican.  Often, I hope.",

The food was decent, and the spicy mayo dip was really good.  Today was my third visit. Halfway through my taco salad, I felt a clump of hair in my mouth. I fished it out, and although I really wanted to believe it had just fallen off my sleeve or shoulder, the clump looked nothing like my hair (blond) or my companion's (red).  We calmly asked for the manager and explained the situation. He picked up the glob of hair off the napkin and told us that it couldn't be the restaurant's fault because none of the employees have dark-brown hair. (Every single one that I saw did.)  Then he walked away, said something to the server that sounded like \"wants a free meal.\" They brought me a bill for $3 for my drink and brought my companion her full bill.  Gross as it was, I understand that mistakes happen. But when he implied that I was lying -- that pissed me off. If something similar had happened in my restaurant, I would have fallen all over myself trying to make it right, not insulted the customer.  Total lack of class and decency. We will never go again.",

Upon arrival, you are greeted with an overflowing basket of chips, salsa and some other white sort of cheese - sort of ranch dressing/sauce. I usually get enchiladas, but basically everything is good. Most noteable is the cheese that they put on top of everything. I'm not quite sure what's different about it, but I can't seem to find it anywhere else, it's delicious. Lunch plates usually run between $4-$7, so it's super cheap.

I think the best location of the chain is in the University area but this one has its moments and has improved again in recent years.  The salsa here is one of my favorites for a mexican place. It's spicy and flavorful and it adds a nice flavor to the otherwise bland rice that comes with many of the meals.    For the meal, 90% of the time I order the same thing, the pollo fundido which is chicken wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried and then topped with cheese and sour cream.  But lately it hasn't been as good as usual and I've come away dissapointed.  A few years ago I stopped coming here because they actually sent out Taquitos instead of the regular dish and I was quite disappointed with this change but they seem to be back to normal now.  One thing is consistent, the service.  It's usually excellent here.  You are rarely waiting for anything and this is one of the reasons I keep coming back.",

We are paying after all.) The food was average, at best. And our food came out on old, CHIPPED plates. Absolutely no excuse for that! And to make it a trifecta of negatives: the guacamole was mushy and slimey. There are far better Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Frankly I don't know how this one stays in business.",

The food has honestly always been very mediocre, but that night was a whole new low in terms of preparation, management and service.  Part of our table got their food a full hour after the rest of us.  Twice, our drink orders were taken and completely lost.  At the end, we stood and waited for over an hour for a wildly inept manager to finally decipher and put together an incorrect bill... But I came back...several times.  No change.  Today my guest ordered a shrimp burrito.  He got steak.  1/3 of my order was wrong, 1/3 never, ever came.  Lucio, the bartender, could not POSSIBLY have been more smug and inattentive.  I'll see everyone at El Veracruz or Cabo's because I'll never be here again!",

    "text": "So, tonight I forgot to plan my night out and after two attempts to visit other restaurants, and unwilling to wait for 45 minutes, I somehow convinced my wife that this was the place for us.  One would think that would not be so difficult, but after our last experience, you can see why she was hesitant.....thank goodness I was driving, or I may just have starved.  Now for the night's meal....it was so much better than our last experience so I deemed it an extra star......it is still lacking the consistency, but this time, our server was spot on!   My wife almost placed a bet with me that the meal, and service would be a repeat of our last visit.  I should have taken the bet. We requested the mild salsa and we actually received it. We requested sweet and water and also received them in a timely manner.  ( It is Sad that a highlight of the meal was that you actually received your drinks correctly).  The meals were very prompt, very tasty, and the server was very attentive even though we were located in the back of the restaurant due to the crowd. She even refilled our drinks, prior to them getting half empty.  This was a redeeming visit for this location and as usual, I will continue to follow up on our visits.  I have given three stars, as I mentioned earlier, it just isn't consistent enough to receive 4 stars.  NCFoodGuy",

    "text": "Generic, prefabricated and typical... That's what you will experience when you visit El Monterrey. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but Jesus, we need another Mexican-themed restaurant in Charlotte as much as we need a minor league baseball team downtown!  When you walk in you will feel a sense of deja vu. You've seen this place a million times in hundreds of cities around the nation. The same shitty decor, the same shitty Budweiser and Corona ads plastered tackily all over the wall. The mass-produced, made-in-china imitation \"papel picado\" and the cheap dining tables and chairs. You have definitely been here before. Sometimes I wonder if the same guy bought all the restaurants in the US and recycled the theme and look and simply changed the  name to keep up a False sense of diversity.  Went with Mother Dearest for lunch today and had a very unremarkable experience. Service was good and fast, food was very nice and tasted as decent as any other of these types of restaurants.  The only thing worth mentioning, and it's not really a good thing, is that with your chips and salsa they also give you a little dish of a white dip. I couldn't place it exactly but it kinda tasted like ranch and bacon. It was very artificial tasting too... maybe from a powder and cream cheese? Who knows? It wasn't horrible, but it just did't mesh well with the other stuff.  Also, for what it is, generic Mexican-themed food, it's kinda pricey. You really won't find a decent dish for under $8 on the menu after 3pm. Just thought I'd throw it out there.  All in all, going here is like going to McDonald's for a burger. You go because you're close by and it's there.",

He treats his guests as if they are an imposition in his day.  He is consistently rude and unprofessional.  If you are a regular customer for years he seats you at the worst table in the building, (even with an empty dining room) and then gives you more attitude when you ask for another table.  You may be serving food, but you are selling service as well.  The food is just okay......nothing to get excited about. The quality of the food is inconsistent and dont be surprised if he charges extra for asking for an extra napkin.  Service and a smile are free-neither of these are on the menu.  I would suggest trying all of the other mexican rstaurants in the area.  You may find they treat you like a guest and imposition?  The moral of this story is \"who is paying who?  The guacamole is out of a can, and the chips and salsa too.  Think twice before you go here unless you like doing business with an establishment that does not value its repeat-long-time customers. Hope they can make it with a \"one and done\" customer.",

This guy at front didn't even greet us I had to ask to be sat and after that I waited like ten minutes with no server and my girlfriend and I decided to walk out and they watched us walk out. So that is the last time I'm coming to this place. It has gone down hill",

    "text": "Candyce B was right again - Monterrey was awesome!  Tucked away in a strip shopping center off of Park Rd (near Black Lion, behind Wendy's), this is the typical small Mexican restaurant that delivers good, cheap eats.  I think this Monterrey has been around for a LONG time (since I was in high school and that was back when Hwy 51 was only 2 lanes...).  I was immediately seated when I walked in, but it took a while for my waiter to get to me.  Though once he did, he was attentive and expedient.  As soon as I was seated, a basket of warm, tasty chips; a small saucer of their salsa, which was a deep red, maybe roasted ingredients?, and not loaded down with cilantro, so I was in love; and a little bowl of heaven, which has been described in the other reviews as white dip, which tasted a little like a thin sour cream with taco seasoning in it - YUM!  It was all I could do to not fill myself up on these 3 delicious starters.  My order: Queso with jalapeno dip ($5) - I have to order queso whenever I go to a Mexican resturant - it's an addiction.  A delicious, dairy addiction.  Served in a large dish, it was very good - perfect thickness without being too thick.  The warm chips held up well. Beef burrito + beef taco + rice lunch special (less than $6) - the taco was in a shell that held up to my crunching, filled with mostly beef, with a sprinkling of lettuce and a healthy dose of shredded white cheese on top.  The beef burrito was a medium size, filled with the same beef as the taco, covered with red sauce and a sprinkling of cheese.  Served with spanish rice that was on the better side of the rice that I have been served at Mexican restaurants - quite good. They serve Pepsi products, so I had a Mountain Dew, which for some reason was the most delicious Mountain Dew I have ever had.    The dip, lunch entree and drink were right around $13 - I was completely stuffed, but not miserable.  I will DEFINITELY be returning, delicious!",

The service staff is like a pack of zombies, there is no personality, no helpfulness.  They were more interested in the little kid that was with an employee. I ordered \"grilled chicken fajitas\". I have had fajitas from many different Mexican restaurants in several states, and they are always sizzling on the iron skillet, and very hot. Until today. This was regular chicken that was very bland, and was not grilled. The onions and green peppers were what I call frozen then cooked. Seemed like my dinner was cooked earlier and then just warmed up.  The rice that was served was almost cold. There was no flavor. For 3 people we paid $42 for a disgusting meal. We won't be back. There are other amazing places in town that do not cut corners, use cheap or frozen ingredients, and serve it hot. Getting food cold like this is a risk for food poisoning. Terrible place to go.",

I live in California and have visited many places in Mexico and rice and beans is a standard! Not an extra option unless ordering Nachos. Making me order a side of rice and beans is just ludicrous. My flautas aka taquitos were not crispy as they should be and they came with a \"salad\" which was basically shredded lettuce with the guacamole and sour cream and pico that goes with the flautas.  But I guess that's what this California Girl gets for trying to eat Mexican food in Charlotte. I will stick with the fab bbq!",

I sat down, the only person in the restaurant, I was greeted very pleasantly.  The chips were ok, the salsa was delicious, not dumbed down and they served that devilish mayonaise sauce that isn't all that good, but it's so bad for you, you can't resist it.  I ordered the lunch special #8 for $4.95, I didn't care what it was, I didn't even give a meat preference, very unlike me. My food came out very promptly, I started inhaling it.  It wasn't the best Mexican food, I'm not going to tell you to rush out and try it, but there was something very comforting about the whole meal.  I notice they have daily drink specials.

From the moment you enter, the greeter seems uninterested and from that point on, service, although attentive, is unmotivated and just not very friendly.  I'm not going to spend much time on the food either, as it doesn't warrant the effort. It is, at best, average. The chips were slightly stale and the salsa just okay. The lunch burrito was large but lacked taste. The rice was dry and tasteless. The tacos were okay.  Again, I had hoped that this place would return to what we remembered in years past, but the owners seem to be \"over it\", and quite frankly, I am too. There are just too many better alternatives in the area.",

Their salsa is watery and not freshly made.  I honestly like the pre made salsa out of a can at the grocery store more than I like their version.  I will say that I LOOOOOVE their spicy ranch dip that is served complimentary with the chips and salsa.  It's spicy and oh so delicious! I always ask for refills.  If you're looking for a good deal you should stop by during lunch time and take advantage of the lunch specials. I've tried several things on their menu and so far I haven't really been that impressed with anything other than the chicken tacos.  Really bums me out because I just love Mexican food and the location is so convenient! I tried the Horchata margarita one night and it was cinnamon deliciousness!   They do always have great service and their cheese dip is on point.  I'll keep coming for the lunch specials to try out some new foods until I find a new favorite!",

Reasonable drink prices, great salsa, and friendly staff. The only downside is my friend got ACP and it was melted shredded cheese instead of queso on it, so i'd make sure to specify if you order ACP and prefer queso on it! Overall good experience, and i'd go back!",

This restaurant is everything you expect from a legit, delicious, and cheap Mexican joint. I got a 4 dollar frozen margarita and hubby got a beer. The chips come with salsa and a delicious mysterious spicy/creamy sauce. I ordered the chicken con queso and it was a cheesy dream. My husband was all over my food and everything was so good. The service was fast and I had a great dinner here, I will be back very soon. Our meal and drinks were under 30 bucks. Come here if you want a tasty, fast, no frills Mexican dish.",

    "text": "After a recent visit, I have to say Monterrey definitely did not live up to what I remember. I stopped in for lunch and found the service and food were both just ok. Service, very slow. After being seated I waited almost 20 minutes before receiving chips and salsa and water. As for the food, the chips and salsa are still good. Chips were fresh, hot and seasoned perfectly with salt. I ordered a combo meal: beef taco, chicken burrito and chicken quesadilla. The beef taco was cold and the meat was very bland, didn't bother finishing that one. The quesadilla and burrito had the same shredded chicken, which I still love. However the quesadilla was lacking the cheese and wasn't that hot, almost like it sat for a while. The burrito was by far my favorite, lots of chicken and cheese covered in a tasty red sauce.  I think another Monterrey location is better and may stick with that one when I have my Mexican cravings.",

    "text": "Go to Don Pedro or El Veracruz instead. This place used to be decent cheap Mexican but it has gone DOWNHILL. It's not even mediocre anymore AND they have raised the prices and cheaped out on ingredients! BEWARE: Menu descriptions don't match what you get! Chiles Relienos: chile peppers stuffed with cheese & meat. Not at ALL like that. It's a little 1 inch shred of limp pepper at the bottom of a mush pile of liquid bean and beef bit mix then smothered with cheese. It's a pile of glop (to put it nicely). We got that AFTER my hubs told the surly waiter that he didn't want any beans with his combo.   Fajitas are WAY overpriced. No gaucamole, no sour cream, no lettuce, no beans, no cheese, no salsa or sauce, no sizzle. Just overcooked mush onions and peppers with frozen, flavorless, dry shrimp atop, bland rice and a big pile of dry cabbage and cilantro bits which used to be Monterrey's garnish \"salad.\"    Manager passed by and saw our salsa was empty and did nothing. We never got offered more beer even though our glasses were dry for 1/2 of our meal. All the food that used to come with the meal now costs $2-3 per 1/4 cup as \"extras.\" Waiters are angry, surly old guys. It's dark inside, quiet, no music, no sound from TVs. They won't take your coupon if you happen to order a beer that's on special that night. WiFi is locked for staff use only!? There is NO reason to go here anymore. It's just sad.",

    "text": "Oh Monterrey...you had me at lime margarita pitchers for $11.99!!! Frozen or on the rocks with sugar or salt on the rim...freaking delicious! Oh my Goodness!!! And thank you for making sure I could taste the liquor!!! Really, really appreciated.   This place was a really great find! But normally the local hole in the walls have the best and most reasonably priced food!   Okay...probably the best thing thing about this place os that they serve white sauce AND salsa with the chips!!! My friends and I were delighted! You see, coming from Virginia we are used to getting salsa and white sauce whenever we have Mexican but since we have been down here everyone thinks the \" white sauce\" we speak of is queso...ummm Nooo!!!   But not here! Every basket of chips we had were hot and the white sauce was spicy and delicious...next time I just need them to leave the container with that sauce on our table. Not even close to joking...it's just that good!   I ordered the Shrimp Chimichangas with cabbage salad and rice. It was scrumptious!!! Nice large shrimp, seasoned well with veggies then deep fried and topped with queso. Heaven! The rice and cabbage salad were very good as well.   Overall, this was a very good meal...easily 4 stars but since they have white sauce...and great customer service they deserve the extra star.   Go...seriously you can thank me later.",
