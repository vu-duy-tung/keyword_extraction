Brisket here can be very good and I've found that the Whit Octane goes best with it. Ribs are also top notch. White slaw, red slaw, fried corn and greens are my favorite sides. They do have Brunswick stew and it is good but not outstanding. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if Yelp would allow it.  As far as knowing their hours, they do have a website.",

    "text": "I'm not a food snob at all...until it comes to BBQ. I am very critical of BBQ, more than I would be at any other type of restaurant. When it comes to the 'Q I know what I want...delicious smoked meat complimented with a great sauce. There are a few joints in the area that I was underwhelmed by, as they either don't have a smokiness to the meat or the sauce is too strong or weak and does nothing for the meat. I'm happy to say that I have found my number two BBQ joint in the area, and it's Saucemans.  Sauceman's feels like a good BBQ place from the start. It's a small place with a few tables and counter service, though they will deliver the food to you if you decide to sit inside after ordering. They also serve a few local beers on draft, and that's always a plus for me.   The menu is pretty straightforward, offering a variety of smoked meats either on a sandwich or a platter with sides. The price is in the right ballpark, and the portions are gigantic. One thing I will say is that they tend to run out of food quickly. We got there at 6PM on a Saturday night and they were already sold out of smoked chicken, brisket and collards. Luckily I had come down with the intention of trying out the ribs, so I was not disappointed.  I got the half rack of pork ribs ($14) and was amazed with the quantity and quality of the food. For starters, the ribs themselves were some of the best. They are not super duper tender, but more importantly they had an excellent smokiness to them. There are a variety of sauces to choose from such as a sweet tomato-based, a spicy mustard and a traditional Carolina vinegar. I enjoyed all three, and I'm not usually a fan of vinegar or mustard sauces. What I found to be the best was combining the tomato and mustard together, making a sweet and spicy sauce that played very nicely with the ribs themselves.   The other important thing to note is that their sides are pretty kickass, which is a feature that some BBQ joints just lack. The mac & cheese is made with pimento cheese so it has a nice kick to it and the macaroni is cooked perfectly, so you get a bit of texture to it and not just a pile of mush. The hush puppies were also really good, though they were a bit too sweet for the missus'. The baked beans were good...nothing fancy, but just done simple and solid. The kicker was the white coleslaw which was crisp, refreshing and not overpowering. I rarely gobble up coleslaw by itself, but this stuff was so good I had no problem devouring whole forkfulls of it.   Now you may be asking how my vegetarian wife managed to eat a meal here. Luckily all their sandwiches are actually a bit indepth and just add whatever meat you want to order. So the missus was able to order the Dixie Cuban ($10.50) without meat and got her dream sandwich of pimento cheese with fried pickles. This sandwich was massive with the cheese oozing out all over. The fried pickles did lose their batter while submerged in this ocean of spiced cheese but they were still good.   It's tough sometimes for a carnivore like me to get to a BBQ joint with an herbivore for a wife. Most places don't have any True vegetarian options aside from a pile of sides, but no one wants a dinner of just fries, mac & cheese and baked beans. Thanks to pimento cheese I now have a place where I can chow down on succulent smoked meats while my wife can choose from a couple of different cheese-based sandwiches.   Thank you Saucemans!!!",

    "text": "Listen, I don't like to give mediocre reviews even when I had a far less than stellar experience at Sauceman's a while back. However, after hearing about some changes they've made, I met a buddy for lunch and gave them another go. I'm very happy to report that this BBQ focused joint in South End is now on my good list, instead of my shit list.   To recap:  Interior: 3/5: The interior is still a bit plain and awkwardly laid out but it looks as if they might be making some changes in that department too. Note - the bathrooms were absolutely spotless.   My order - The Poncho Villa w/turkey: 4/5: Big hunks of tasty turkey layered with avocado, pepper jack cheese & lime mojo folded into Texas Toast. It was plenty of food and it was delicious. I also tried a few onion rings and I fully appreciate that they are hand breaded and had great flavor...my only ish with these - they could have been much crispier.   The service: 5/5: The man who took my order was awesome. Super friendly, helpful and honest with suggestions and made sure I had everything I needed. A far cry to the lackadaisical attitude I received last time.   I noticed that this place was a bit busy during the lunch hour and folks were leaving looking happy and full...always a good sign. I'll definitely head back to Sauceman's to try some other sandwich creations or to score some of that savory barbecue.",

I am very willing to put up with questionable service if the food is great, but my experience at Sauceman's just wasn't worth it.    We placed our order and waited 30 mins - so long that the music playlist of 80s hits started to repeat itself.  During that 30 mins, the two female servers proceeded to REPEATEDLY bring the wrong food to our table... and to 2 of the other 3 tables with patrons waiting.  The dining area is split into two rooms, and there were about 10 people in our room, and maybe 6 in the other room, and with about 2 to 4 people waiting for take-out orders.  For 30 mins, we watched these 2 unorganized, poor souls circle around the room, bringing the wrong food to tables, apologizing, asking what they ordered, and then bring the wrong food AGAIN.  My table ordered 2 plates (simple), yet we were brought racks of ribs, sandwiches, and everything except our correct order.  We watched the girls comp the two tables before us (not a good sign), then eventually comp our table.  They were very apologetic, and tried to ease the pain by feeding me free beers to make up for it.  Don't know how this establishment will ever make any money by messing up orders and giving away food and beers for free.  Now, about the food.  The mac & cheese was on the bland side, but the chopped pork, and ribs and sauces were very good.  The brisket was a little on the dry side (but good nonetheless) and the slaw would be better called \"cabbage soup,\" since that's what the consistency was like.  Our food came out cold - that probably had to do with the mess in the kitchen.  And the burnt ends appetizer came out about 5 mins after our entrees did (approx 40 mins after we placed our original order).  But, overall the food was good, but not great enough to deal with the absolute tragedy in the back of house.  There were no managers or owners on site.  If there were, maybe this place would run a little more smoothly.  The food is very good, but so is my grandmother's.  If this establishment continues on this track, it will be another Charlotte casualty within 3 years.  Places with equal to slightly worse food but MUCH BETTER SERVICE will blow this place out of the water.  1 star because the food is good, but the service was awful.  If they get a manager in there to run the show and smooth things out, then this place will succeed.  But until then, I wont be back.",

Tried bites of everyone else's food - chopped pork was super moist and way tasty (also love it when bbq places use a high quality white bread bun, and they do), mac and cheese had huge cheddar flavor and an entirely homeade taste, hushpuppies were basically funnel cake balls.

We decided to take a risk on Sauceman's, and I am so glad we did.  The menu is not extensive, but it's all you really need. The brisket was out which was a total bummer (and part of the reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5), but the pulled pork was really good and definitely satisfied.  All four of us were very pleased, overall. We tried some different sides to go with our meals--collared greens were a big hit, as were the hush puppies and the potato salad.  I had the fried corn, which was delicious, but it had so much pepper on it I couldn't eat it (although my friend Dave gladly finished it for me). The fried green tomatoes were really good, but I had just had Terrace Cafe's that morning, and honestly there is no comparison. Terrace Cafe's fried green tomatoes are the ultimate in Charlotte.  For BBQ, sides, and local beer, this is probably my favorite spot in Charlotte so far. I am still hoping for that five-star gem that will be the equivalent of Raleigh-Durham BBQ, but this is a great place to satisfy until I can travel out there again.",

They have an excellent staff, all of which are courteous, attentive, and just plain nice. You can tell the management cares about what they do and are really striving to prepare the best food they can.  Good sized portions, great taste, and good atmosphere.   One small negative, they could work on the sauces. Maybe one with a little more spice.  They are expanding their footprint! It's going to be needed.",

The hours on their sign have changed so many times I can't keep up. I even tried to call before I arrived to make sure they had mac-and-cheese which is awesome but no one answered the phone.. it was about 8:15 pm. Breweries in Southend close at 10:00! Oh well!

    "text": "Was really excited about trying Sauceman's.  Now that I have, I know that if I travel this distance from home for cue, it will be to go to Midwood Smokehouse instead.  Don't get me wrong, Sauceman's serves above average BBQ but, there are just some things that don't add up to what Midwood brings to the table.  Let's take them one by one.  1.  The meat.  Got a three meat combo platter with Ribs, Brisket and Pork.  The ribs were great, came sauced (dry would be a nice option) with two bones.  Brisket was one fairly large slice with tons of fat and it was dry with little in the way of a visible smoke ring.  Pork was chopped and good with nice mix of pork, bark, etc.  But, it was cold.  2.  Portion size.  Very small for the price tag.  At Midwood, a combo is a four bucks more but I've never ever finished all the meat and always bring some home for a late night snack.  I could have eaten two full portions of what Sauceman's offered up.  3.  Sides.  Good, hot crinkle cut fries which is a must since they're pretty hard to f'up.  The slaw had great flavor but...  The texture of the chopped cabbage in it made it clear it was, at minimum, yesterday's batch.  Think rubbery not crunchy.  The sides at Midwood are always as good as the cue and help make the meal.  4.  Service.  Quick and friendly.  That all sums up to an A-OK place that would be in danger of a 2 Star review update if I went again and had the same meal.",

    "text": "I've eaten at Sauceman's many times since they've been open. My last visit made me so angry that I deleted all my previous glowing reviews, and there were several of them.  ================================================  When I first came here after they opened, their burnt ends pork BBQ was fantastic.  Their barbecue sandwiches were massive and delicious. Their panko breaded onion rings were nothing short of amazing.  Service was decent, but nothing to brag about.  Their postage stamp size parking lot was horrendous then, and it has only gotten worse as the restaurant has grown in popularity.  This restaurant was too small even on day one.   They have added a ton of outside dining to try and compensate for the lack of seating, but what they really need is a much larger building and more parking.  ================================================  My last visit.........the straw that broke the camel's back.  The Rastafarian Brother who was running the cash register was slow as molasses. He couldn't get orders correct the first time around. He acted like he couldn't understand English. He had an attitude. Frankly, he acted like he was high on ganja. He was talking with people in the back of the line, laughing, and doing everything but his job. It took a good fifteen minutes - just to place my order, and I was third in line, because he was being such a Richard. (In retrospect, I wish that I had just left and gone anywhere else.) $#@&#@!!!  After what seemed an eternity, I grabbed a spot at one of the few empty tables, laid down my receipt and order placard, and I went to go get some sweet tea. When I returned thirty seconds later, my receipt was gone, and my order placard was gone! $#@&#@!!!  Luckily, I remembered my order number.  It took a good twenty minutes for my food to be prepared, and the entire time I sat on pins and needles hoping to flag down the runner. When what I thought was my order went by, headed for the outside tables, I quickly asked the employee if that was order #61. He said, \"yes, it is,\" and looked at my table for verification. I told him that someone had removed my order placard, but that was my food. No receipt. No order placard. He gave me a puzzled look, but luckily he believed me, and I got to eat the lunch that I paid for. {sigh}  The food was not nearly as good as previous visits, in fact it was disappointingly mediocre. The portion sizes were smaller and the prices were higher. It just wasn't very good, and it certainly wasn't worth all the BS that I had to go through.   I haven't been back since, and I have no plans to EVER return. Lexington 'Q kicks their rear end, and for that matter, every other BBQ restaurant in Charlotte. Midwood Smokehouse is waaaay better. McKoy's is better. So is Bill Spoons, Mac's Speed Shop, Shane's Rib Shack, Bubba's BBQ, and Bobbee O's. None of the aforementioned businesses are a pain in the rear to visit either.   When I am in the Queen City, I just drive right past Sauceman's on the way to other restaurants that appreciate my business. Who needs that type of aggravation?",

I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and will recommend that you should eat here around lunch instead of dinner when it's fresher. Maybe that would help.  I don't know if I should give them 3 or 4 stars.   I ordered the rough chopped pork. Mostly moist, tender, delicious. Nice smoke and porky flavor. The Eastern style dip was nice. I like mine with a little more seasoning. The red sauce and mustard sauces are both very good. Not overly sweet at all. The mustard was a little spicier than I like.   I wouldn't order the ribs. They're not thoughtfully prepared at all.  Tough and just tasted like the sauce they come slathered with. It doesn't seem like I'm eating at the same place that so perfectly showcased the pork. They only gave me two tiny ribs with my two meat plate and I was offended at first but after I tried them I was glad for the skimpy portion.   I had the red slaw. I hate mayo slaw and happily they serve this vinegar slaw. Wonderful. I like the greens.  They don't need sugar in my opinion. Finally, they serve the worst hush puppies I have had anywhere!!!!!   They probably sat around awhile for sure. They had a really tough, thick exterior and had an over fried and under seasoned flavor. Wow.   I'm confused by how good some of it was and how terrible the rest. I would come back and have a pork sandwich and some slaw. I'll bet the brisket is good.",

    "text": "I can't explain how a once great bbq joint has slid so low so quickly. They have plenty of trophy's and awards on display, but what they didn't have when I visited was a great meal to offer. I picked my Wife up at work, and wanted to celebrate our 25th Anniversary with a nice lunch. Fortunately she picked Sauceman's, not me.   The first warning sign was that they were out of most of the fountain drinks. There was a hand written sign that said to get a can from the cooler. Except the cooler was out of diet sodas. When I asked, the woman behind the counter suggested I drink water. That was strike 1.  We received our meals quickly, but before the server could walk away, I asked her if what I received was the $9 pork plate. The portion of hush puppies outweighed the pork on my plate. She said \"yes, they weigh the pork\", then walked away. Wow! That was strike 2.  My Wife ordered the brisket sandwich, her usual menu choice. At first glance, all looked good. There was so much brisket that she had to take some out of her sandwich so she could fit it in her mouth. Before she took a bite, I looked at the meat on her plate, and showed her how dry it was. When I posted the picture one of my fellow Yelpers commented that it looked like jerky, not brisket. Strike 3.  I don't know what happened to them, hopefully they can turn things around again. If it was just some dry brisket, I could forgive them. But between the issues with the soda, and the terribly small portions, it looks to me like this could be the beginning of the end for Sauceman's.",

My bf and I split the $22 south end sampler with brisket, pork, and chicken. All 3 were amazing. The rub on the brisket was to die for. The chicken was the best surprise though, as I never get chicken when going to BBQ, and it was DELICIOUS. For sides we got mac and cheese and fried corn. Both were fantastic, I highly recommend. The season on the corn was amazing! Even down to the sweet tea and hush puppies, everything was perfect. The ONE thing I could gripe about are the serving sizes...you get a lot more bang for your buck in KC. But I'm also not leaving uncomfortably full! Overall, it's definitely delicious BBQ!",

Smoky Q, of course savory sauce choices and awesome sides make this joint the spot. While I wait in line to order, yes please, I will treat my self to some house made pork rinds. I went with the classic pork this trip paired with mac & cheese and onion rings. On the pork I added Texas Pete and the classic vinegar based sauce to create the slurry that I love on chopped pulled pork. Huge serving, depending on appetite you can even share a plate. Most BBQ places have generic mac & cheese, not Sauceman's. Strong cheese flavors with plenty of pepper made it some of the best mac I have had. True seal of approval, my 5 year old doesn't eat much. He loved the pork and mac & cheese. If it's not pizza or chicken nuggets he won't approve much. Sauceman's is truly five star Q.",

Tonight I had the Sauceman's Original grilled sandwich.  Layers of Brisket covered in Cheddar cheese, fried onions and tomatoes.  Yummy!  My only complaint was the paltry 6 onion rings as my side.  Hey, if I'm paying for a side, give me some onion rings.  These were tiny and left me wanting more of their delicious rings.    Overall, I'd have to say that Sauceman's is one of my favorite Charlotte BBQ spots.",

The hush puppies were small but fresh fried, crispy and tasty. The slaw had the right mix of sweet and vinegar. I don't know what kind of sauce they gave me, but it tastes home made and authentic. The fries were nothing to write home about. Seasoned right and crispy, but awfully skinny, shoe-string size for hand-cut. There were a lot of them on the plate though.

It's a great BBQ joint and the pulled pork is great. They have a really great sweet and spicy sauce and the chicken is really great too. The only downside is they are often short on a couple menu items by late in the day because of the high demand. The past three times I've gone they were out of Brunswick Stew and I've been dying to try it.

I recently had the reuben (The Reub): bread was very good and fresh (kaiser-like), tons of meat but lacked a strong flavor, slaw was ok, and could of used a little more thousand.  I would say its like \"the Fuel of bb-q\". I do look forward to trying their rib and chicken plate someday when I am starving and have my kids with me.  Walk up ordering and they play all kinds of music. Service is friendly (especially the dreaded guy).  They serve beer too.",

I agree that the fries seemed like they had freezer burn prior to being cooked.  Also confused as to why they have so much staff always there - it seems like there is more staff than patrons. I was excited for this place to open and am disappointed that it seems to have missed the mark.  Hopefully a lot will change over the next few months.  I may try it again in 6 months to see if it has improved but I won't be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I normally don't write reviews, but felt compelled to write about some of my visits to Sauceman's for constructive purposes. They are a new establishment and have kinks to work out. With that stated, lets begin. The first time I went with my father, they were brand new. The guy at the register didn't greet us...just ask what we wanted. We ordered two plates and he shouts out red or white. He was talking about the slaw, which we had no clue. I just feel as a new restaurant, you should greet patrons by welcoming them there, asking if this is their first time, and then explain how the ordering process works. Yeah they have a chalk menu (that probably clarifies a few things), but it's high up, very lengthy, and the type needs to be larger. I do recall waiting more than usual for such a small order. The BBQ was good, with good ole charred pieces in it. You add the sauce, which are SC mustard, Eastern vinegar based, and a Western tomato based....and they're not labeled, which is annoying. There may be more...I just remember these. The SC mustard didn't taste good at all....tasted like the plastic bottle it was in. I've never been a fan of vinegar, so I went with western, which was ok. Don't really remember the sides for that particular trip. My next trip was with a friend that had been wanting to try them out. We both got the BBQ sandwich's. His with fries, mine with rings. The sandwich's were plenty big, with meat falling out of them. They were also reasonably priced compared to other local BBQ places. The rings, which can easily be screwed up, weren't greasy, and had a crunch to them. They passed. My third trip was when me and some friends did were in a jam and needed food fast. We got Sauceman's  tailgate special to go. We got que, buns, beans, slaw, and hush puppies. This was a \"basic\" BBQ tailgate meal and we had no problems with anything. The $38 also seemed reasonable. Well....now for the reason I'm writing this. My girlfriend had been wanting to try them out, so we went by last Friday-7/3/12. We both got a pork plate. Mine with white slaw/mac n cheese. Hers with red slaw/collards. They both had two big hush puppies on each plate. First off, the que was tasty, but the sides were just awful. My white slaw was floating in mayonnaise...way too watery. I hate slaw like this. I was told the ketchup/vinegar based slaw was good. The mac n cheese was a big let down. You feel like you should get authentic, homemade mac n cheese at a BBQ place, but this looked like what I used to make as a kid with the powdered Kraft stuff. It literally had these clumps of lumpy, powdered like cheese pieces that made it look disgusting and it didn't taste that good either. The collards did taste alright, but could use better seasoning. We didn't even eat our hush puppies. They were saturated with grease that ran down your lips when you bit in to them...just nasty. Also, the batter was very bland tasting. Needed some onion, heat, or something. So the bottom line for me is that the BBQ is good here. They just to work on their wait staff and sides. Sides are very important. That's where a place like Mac's or Midwood Smokehouse beats them hands down. Wishing you the best Sauceman's!!!",

    "text": "Whatever misguided notions this restuarant had when it initially opened, and whatever subsequent misconceptions people have about Sauceman's. forget about them.  This is a different place than it was 6 months ago.  Who this place is now is an in-and-out Lexington BBQ joint, open for a quick lunch during the week or a BBQ feast for a weekend dinner.  And let me try to put this in the best way that I can:  This is easily the best Lexington-style BBQ that I have had, and I grew up just outside of Lexington, NC!  It's so good, I keep coming back.  Also, there is enough versatility on the menu that if I ever do get tired of this BBQ (which will never happen), I have plenty of other options to try.  But as far as commercial BBQ restaurants in the Charlotte area, this is, BY FAR, the best place for BBQ, including that restaurant not 2 miles away down South Blvd.  I can't even remember the name of it anymore.",

    "text": "I was in the mood for barbecue on this particular trip to Charlotte so I figured I would give Sauceman's a try.  Restaurant was easy to locate across from Bojangles at the intersection of Tryon and West St. It's only maybe a quarter mile from I-77. Only negative is not many parking spots so if you get one at the building you're lucky. Inside is your typical barbecue restaurant. Not many seats thought I'd have to estimate around 30-50 max capacity. The restaurant can confuse you if it's you're a first timer because where you order is in the middle of the place and the drink machine is on the other side of the wall of the register where there are additional seats.  The pulled pork barbecue has very good smokey flavor with three sauces to choose from. A western nc style sauce that tastes like a regular store brand sauce honestly. The eastern style vinegar based sauce is a good choice if that style is how you like your sauce. The third is a mustard based sauce that, you guessed it, tastes like mustard.  The brisket was fork tender and I didn't even need the knife they gave me. It also had a good smoke flavor but between the two I'd have to rate the pulled pork the better of the two. It is North Carolina after all. The cole slaw comes in a French fry tray and I believe it is a pickle juice based slaw and has good flavor but mind you I'm not a big slaw guy. Both brisket and barbecue come with texas toast but you don't notice until you eat down the barbecue because it is piled on top of the toast. The hushpuppies are good and crunchy as well, and just the right size.  Overall you get your money's worth in the barbecue plates and the kids sandwich is the size of a regular adult sandwich at most places. Outside of the parking issue, and getting confused finding the drink machine, Sauceman's gets a good 4 from me.",

    "text": "Since it happens to effect almost everything i wrote about in my initial review I feel obligated to update with some info i picked up on my last visit.  Apparently, there have been some menu changes since they were featured on BBQ Pitmasters. I was told they couldn't keep up with the increased  business so the fried options such as corn and fried green tomatoes are now only available on the weekends. Originally someone said  the grilled sandwiches were being completely removed from the menu (major bummer since those were my absolute fave), but now their website says they are available but only on Fridays after 2pm and Sat. Which is cool i guess that they weren't taken off altogether but those time changes pretty much guarantee that im not going to be able to eat them again anytime soon. So in conclusion before heading there to check out anything mentioned in my review check the time and day of the week to alleviate any potential disappointment in case the items are not being offered.",

    "text": "Saying a restaurant has the best BBQ in Charlotte is kind of like saying \"Moe was the smartest stooge\" But this place has the best in Charlotte, hands down. The parking lot is awkward and the interior layout is weird, and I hate anyplace that makes you stand at a counter and order... but all that aside, I came for the food and I was not disappointed. My wife got a rack of ribs. These are not some anemic baby back, small, petite, minor pig ribs. These are full size, huge, jumbo spare ribs, with so much meat and fat and flavor that a family of four could eat off of them for a week. We brought most of them home for supper. The ribs were cooked perfectly and the sauce was a compliment, not a distraction. I got the brisket, because I didn't want to ride the pulled pork train again, as much as I love the stuff, I wanted something different. Good brisket is not easy to do but they hit a home run on this one too. Tender, moist, flavorful, with that smoky \"bark\" that I love. The fries were outstanding , the first order was limp, but they quickly took them away and fixed them and they were amazing when we got them back. My wife loved the deep fried corn, and we split on the slaw, I had the red, she had the white, both were deemed adequate.  Saucemans is good people, making good food, you can bet your brisket I'll be back.",

The smoked Turkey is incredibly moist & a choice in all of the specialty sandwiches(the one we tried was over the top) We tried several sides;homemade fresh onion rings & hushpuppies were killer ! Fresh cut fries,red & white slaw & homemade potato salad were delicious .Baked beans were good but average.All3 sauces offered were good.   Serving sizes are huge & inexpensive. Service is very casual but friendly. Ambiance is Q shack , but that's what it is ! New caricatures, pig art & a cool \"family tree\" of BBQ  in NC are just being done.Outside a large fence has funky graphics with a few pigs ! Seems the place is evolving.  One of the owners & the actual pitmaster came to our table ,talked Q with us & shared how the restaurant  made a complete turnaround in July with totally different menu & perked up decor . That might explain all the negative reviews that were written prior to July . There is VERY little to complain about now!! That food is SMOKIN' !!  We will become regulars & plan to participate in their Panther game day tailgate packs -- far better than fried chicken and a whole lot more bang for your buck !  Get there while you can still get in ---they are slammed @ lunch & the word is out ! Bon Appetit !!",

I know it's petty but ...AND more beer and better beer.  CLT is a beer hub now.  Get the NODA on tap and I'll commit to putting on 10 pounds.  With all this said, THE BEST Q IN TOWN.",

I dislike barbecue with lumps of fat in it that I have to eat around, but this wasn't like that at all. I was able to finish all the pork on my plate. The portion was just right for lunch, and wasn't a bad deal for around 8 bucks. I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "I came into Sauceman's with a generous BOGO coupon (up to $15 in value) and a friend. I say generous because 80% of their menu is under $10, with only 1 or 2 items even breaking past $15. So, needless to say, this place was cheap.  I purchased the $12 chicken and ribs platter. You get a chicken breast and wing along with 1/3 a rack of ribs (or a \"rib tickler\" as I believe they call it). You also get a large portion of fries, 2 sugar biscuits, and the choice of an additional side. I order the baked beans. My friend purchased the $8 or $9 steak sandwich, which came with the choice of a side (she ordered fries) and whatever toppings you wanted on the sandwich.  The amount of food for the price was absolutely incredible. My platter was literally served on a platter and was only $12. The chicken was a small piece, but the breast was surprisingly meaty. It was very tender and juicy and covered in their delicious BBQ. The ribs were a little bit on the dry side. They were certainly not falling off the bone and they required a little extra BBQ, but they were by no means bad. Again, for the price, they were awesome. The baked beans were very very tasty. They were made with their BBQ and almost had a sweet chili taste to them. I'm not normally a baked beans fan, but I devoured these. The french fries were french fries, but in a massive portion... They were basically a restaurant version of McDonald's fries, which is not a bad thing. The sugar biscuits were the same thing that you find at Chinese buffets, but they were much fresher then you'd find at any buffet.   All together, I was very pleased with Sauceman's. They serve cheaper restaurant quality food, but in a Cook Out or Penguin style setting. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you at your seat. You refill your drinks yourself and when you are done, they clear your table for you. They seem to cater to carry out a lot, but they have a small amount of inside seating for you to dine in at.   At the price, I couldn't help but give this place 5 stars.",

Man was that a HUGE mistake!!  1st red flag was that at 6pm, there was not a soul in the place.  2nd red flag, the hush puppies were burnt all the way thru.  I was not happy at this point, but I was really in the mood for BBQ.  I ordered the BBQ plate with 1/2 turkey and 1/2 pork bbq, well the turkey was cold and was nothing special.  Actually it was like a turkey tenderloin I could cook at home.  Then i tried the bbq, and every bite was either all fat or cold.  My husbands fries were burnt and bbq was cold too.  HORRIBLE",

I went with the pulled pork and rib combo, and opted for their baked beans and red slaw as sides. The pulled pork was very good, and ended up being the best part of the meal. I like the rough chop, which was moist with a nice bit of bark, and had a good smoke flavor. I wasn't quite so impressed with the vinegar sauce, which lacked flavor and did little to enhance the meat. I am a fan of the red slaw, which is a sweet and sour North Carolina specialty.   The ribs were a big disappointment, with not much going on except for an overly sweet sauce. They were tough and surprisingly bad, given the quality of the pulled pork. I also didn't much like the baked beans. So, some things to like here and some to avoid, which doesn't add up to barbecue greatness.",

The employee says that will be $9.74...I give her my card...she swipes it..I sign.  Simple transaction right? Wrong!    We both walk over to the take out window and stand there.  The kitchen staff is looking at us as we are looking at them.  The employee that rang up my order ask them where is my order..they respond there is no \"to go\" ticket on their side.  Ok so there's some type of internal issue going on..nothing to do with me.  I just want my order and continue to wait.  Finally the employee tells the manager the tickets are not printing.  He proceeds to go back up to the register counter to determine what's going on.   Again, nothing to do with me. Still waiting at the the \"to go\" window.  The manager yells at me \"You need to pay\"!  Ugh excuse me sir are you talking to me?  I inform him that I've paid.  In the rudest tone he ask me for my receipt! My first thought is \"shouldn't you have a copy in the register?\" But I comply.  I walk over to the register and provide him with the receipt.  He looks at it and tells to the cashier that she rang up the wrong order.  Again, why is this my issue? He ask me for my card is an abrupt manner \" I need your card\".  Again the tone in which he is speaking is offensive.  Clearly he's frustrated but where and why am I receiving this negativity? And yet still no one has made my Mac and cheese.  He swipes my card and charges me $10.83 and voids the other transaction.   The manner in which he's doing this I ask him if he's going to apologize to me since I clearly didn't cause this mix up but feel like I'm being blamed for this? He looks me in my face and says \"I'm not being rude\" walks over to the take out window throws the container in a bag and tells me to have a \"nice day\" in the most condescending tone.   Let's just say.. I will not be patronizing this place again and unfortunately nothing will probably change there because he appeared to be management!!  Let me know where there's some good mac and cheese without the attitude.",

    "text": "I had heard Sauceman's mentioned more than once when asking friends what the best barbecue joints were in town. Before yesterday I had only been to Midwood Smokehouse. I've always liked what I've eaten there as well, but I knew there had to be a more basic no nonsense type of place like this.   I went on a Monday around 2pm and walked right up to the counter to place my order despite many seats being filled. The lunch crowd had likely left by this point and the place was calm yet steady with customers. After some deliberation on whether to get ribs or pork I went with the pork plate with fried pickles as my side. The plate also comes with two hush puppies and your choice of red or white slaw.   My meal came served on a lunch tray lined with a torn sheet of butcher paper as old school barbecue should be. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of pork. I was also very happy that the meat came out unsauced,  allowing you to apply whatever amount and flavor you like. You can choose among the three varieties placed on the table near each seat.   The pork was really good. My personal preference would be to have a little more fat incorporated in with the chopped meat, however I definitely can't complain about the flavor as it was. I applied two of the sauces, leaving out the vinegar sauce, and really enjoyed them both. The hush puppies were perfectly fried and crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful inside. They were honestly some of the best I've had before. The same goes for the fried pickles. I'm not a big slaw fan so I didn't dig into that too much.   As of now I'll say this is my favorite barbecue place I've tried in town. I hope to explore as many other spots as I can as I hear about them so we'll see how it holds up over time. Next time I go to Sauceman's I'll get the ribs plate, which will be the ultimate test of their barbecue mastery.",

I don't care if they charge 15$ for it, but please bring the SOUTHERN BELL back. It was one of the best sandwiches and now your only options are the most basic meat on bread, and sides. And meat. It feels like it doesn't have the same expertise behind it. It feels like something I would throw together with leftovers.

    "text": "Carolina BBQ at its best. The feel of this corner restaurant is industrial. Big open spaces, wood-topped tables with metal chairs and a self-serve pork cracklings station while you either wait for your take-out, or sit down to BBQ. Personally, I did the eating challenge (not on the menu) which consisted of 2.5 lbs of pulled pork (dry rubbed, unsauced)with 4 buns,  4 hush puppies (which are deep fried balls of funnel cake batter), and a double serving of 2 sides (I went with their red slaw, which is tangy and bright made with vinegar instead of mayonnaise and collard greens, a vegetarian option not made in the traditional style with bacon which retained a bit of crispness and coloration as it also had some vinegar in the cooking process). Their house made sauces have just the right amount of heat. Even their traditional sauce isn't overly sweet nor viscous. Because of this, the challenge was a breeze, their pulled pork was perfectly tender, and the hospitality was great.",

    "text": "Tried Sauceman's for the first time through Foodsby delivery service at my job. Very impressed with their promptness. Since I tend to Yelp everything beforehand, I ended up ordering the Hoff Dog (smoked texas hotlink) with white slaw and a side of mac n cheese. The bun was perfectly soft and the sausage had a kick to it, which I loved. They were kind enough to put the slaw on the side as to not make my bun soggy. Thanks!   The show stopper for me was definitely the mac n cheese. Creamy, cheesy goodness that I ended up eating before I even tasted the hot link. I have to warn you tho...a side of it cost 3.50 for a very small container.  It really is ridiculously small for the amount of money spent but I did enjoy it and kinda want some more right now. :)   I am pretty sure I'll order again to try other highly recommended items; however, I am tempted to pay them a visit just to see if you're given a bigger portion of the mac when dining in since I'm having a hard time re-ordering at that price knowing how little you get.   All in all, if you havent tried it...TRY IT.  I think you'll enjoy it.",

    "text": "I rarely get to review a restaurant's food because there are often bigger hangups to deal with at any restaurant I visit.  Recently I was going to a show uptown and made a special trip to visit Sauceman's, knowing it was on the way.  Typically I have only come to Sauceman's for lunch, or on the weekend, so I am not familiar with their strange hours.  But even if I were, am I expected to keep them memorized forever?  On a Thursday, this place closes at 6 PM.  Why?  Heck if I know.  But that's not really the point.  Point is, I got there at about 5:40 PM, and was excited to eat.  When I came in, I noticed all of the chairs were upturned on the tables, trashcans were empty, without bags, and there was one other customer waiting for a to-go order.  Seeing the chairs the way that they were, I just assumed they were cleaning the restaurant and mopping the floors after lunch, and were getting it ready to re-open for dinner.  I told the female cashier (who I am almost certain is the poorly placed manager - she has been in supervisor mode every visit I have made) my order, and she specifically asked, \"For here or To-Go?\".  I said \"for here\" and she didn't argue.  She took my order, and I flipped the chairs back over at one table and went to the restroom.  When I came back, my food was waiting and I got ready to dig in.  I then noticed that there was no BBQ sauce on my sandwich, and no sauce bottles on the table.  I rounded the corner to tell her there were no bottles on the table, and her response made me want to gag.  Rather than saying, \"I'm sorry sir, that is my fault, here you are...\" the smart mouth turned her back to me while mumbling to her coworker  \"Yeah, that's 'cause we're closed\".  Am I wrong here, or is that how you are supposed to talk to customers that go out of their way to eat at your establishment?  I was stunned.  She got the best of me.  I cannot tell you how hard my teeth were clenched to keep from getting back up and letting these people have it.  Instead I quietly seethed and tried to enjoy the food, which was good, but irrelevant to the matter at hand.  While sitting there I watched a couple come in and ask if they could dine in.  The cashier told her they closed at 5 but they would still take to-go orders.  This was my first time hearing this - something I should have been told the second I walked in.  Maybe I am partially to blame for not questioning the upturned chairs, but again - it's 6:00 on a Thursday, and no normal person has ever looked at the door of a restaurant to say \"Hmm, I wonder if they close early on this weekday?\"  The couple that came in after me waited on their to-go order, and I ate as fast as I could to get out of there and go write this review... and also to remove the incredible burden I had caused them by being there.  I am fed up with people not appreciating the business they receive, and this restaurant can be added to the list.  I am sure the owners would love to know that the workers talk about the customers behind their backs like teenagers, but I cannot find out the owner(s) names to tell them.  That's probably just the way they want it to be.",

After a 4 mile trek in the blazing summer heat, we made it there, still breathing!  My thoughts during our trek were \"this better be worth it!\"  IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WALK!  Small little BBQ joint with with the most amazing food!  I opted for the \"Sweet Smoke\" (BBQ  Pork, Sweet Granny Smith Slices, Cheddar Cheese & House-Smoked Applewood Bacon on Texas Toast).  Heaven in my mouth!  I also had the fried green tomatoes and homemade mac n' cheese.  Both were out of this world, melt in your mouth delicious!  I can't say enough about the awesomeness of this place!  (Also tried the Dixie Cuban (BBQ Pork, Pimento Cheese and Fried Pickles on Texas Toast -  another winner!)  P.S.

The turkey was actually really good, but if I had to guess the portion was about 3oz. of meat. The sandwich is $7.50, so you would expect something more substantial for that amount of money, but no the sandwich was 3oz. of meat and some lettuce on the side to put on top of the sandwich.  Got a side of hush puppies and they were ok, although a little burnt to be honest. No honey butter or anything along those lines to dip it in, so the dryness was accentuated for me with that.  Overall, might go back one more time to give it a shot, but wasn't impressed this go round.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge meat-eater, so I'm going to focus on the veggies for this review....and, comparing them to Mac's down the way since that is my favorite BBQ joint.  Amazing fresh, seasoned crinkle-cut fries. I mean, they're crinkle-cut fries, but try them. Seriously. I've never had Mac's fries, but I doubt they get much better than this.  Lightly battered yet crispy and flavorful fried pickles (edged out Mac's for my number 1 fried pickle, which was not an easy decision!)  Fried corn-good, but with the French fries and fried pickles, I probably would have enjoyed this corn freshly steamed/grilled better. Add salt-it makes it yummier.   Macaroni and cheese. Not bad, uses more of a cheese sauce than melty/crusty/baked cheese. I prefer the latter, and depending on the day (i.e. Mac's isn't skimping on the cheese), Mac's has them beat.  The collard greens were sweet and yummy, but I felt like the serving was a little small. Mac's has a little more spice and tang to the sweetness, adding depth of flavor, but I did enjoy them and would order them again.  The baked beans were just okay to me. They had a little extra BBQ or smoked flavor, but they didn't stand out to me. I happen to love Mac's baked beans so the bar was very high, but I'd probably give them a 5/10, whereas Mac's gets a 10 out of 10 for me.  My son got the beef brisket the first time we went, but it was pretty fatty and from my perspective Mac's has amazing brisket. I got turkey the last time I went and it was okay, a little dry. The BBQ sauce was good though, which made up for it, almost.  Overall Sauceman's will be added to our list of BBQ choices, but probably only when I'm craving their fries and pickles.",

Each provides a very different experience with your meal.  In addition to the slaw, you select a side and I am committed to the mac n' cheese.  I don't like the \"velveeta\" style mac n cheese but a real side with real mixed cheeses.  Sauceman's does not disappoint.  Additionally, I also like that the sauces are kept at the table so that customers can sample different types with their pulled pork, brisket, turkey or chicken.  I usually mix it up!!   The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is the small venue, and the lack of parking.   The food, and customer service, however, are great!",

    "text": "FINALLY a REAL BBQ JOINT for a REAL BBQ lover....  I don't give out FIVE stars very often, so when I do, you can best believe the establishment definitely earned every last star.  I'll jump right to it and say, \"Sauceman's is a BBQ lover's dream!\"   I went here after the MLK Jr. Day Bobcats' game with some friends, and the first thing that struck me was that smokey BBQ smell wafting throughout the parking lot and inside the establishment.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see that it was not crowded at all.  In fact, my three comrades and I were the only ones in there for a while.  After perusing the menu, I settled on a BBQ sandwich with white slaw.  My gf went with the BBQ chicken wings with a side of mac-n-cheese.    We definitely had to wait a good while for our food to arrive.  But sometimes I feel its ok to wait a minute or two.  Sometimes it indicates that your food isn't just sitting under a heating lamp, but instead is being freshly prepared, and the later is exactly what was taking place at Sauceman's.  I know, because I could see pitmasters preparing the food before my eyes.  When our food finally arrived, we appropriately sauced our items, (but not over-sauced) and got to business.  The pulled pork was nothing short of perfect.  It was tender, warm, juicy, succulent, it was EUPHORIA!  The bread was great as well.  There is nothing worse than a flimsy bun that can't handle the sauce and slaw being added to the sandwich without falling apart.  Of course I tasted my gf's wings and I can say without hesitation that they are on my list of top five wings in Charlotte.  The were thrown over a flame before being served and had plenty of sauce.  My gf also ordered a side of mac-n-cheese to go with her wings and I can vouch with a previous reviewer and say that the mac-n-cheese (though pricey) was amazing!  Everyone I was with loved their food.  There wasn't a single complaint from the group.  By the time we were on our way out of the door, we were already planning our next visit.  In fact, the food was sooooo good, I ordered a half-slab of ribs to go! (see pics)   I wanted to quickly mention the following: -Better beer selection than what you would expect. -I hear lunch can be crowded, so you might want to avoid going here during lunch hours, I went around 6pm and the place was empty. -Their hours have recently changed.  They are now open until 9pm on most nights I believe.   -The menu has also changed. -Great blues/rock tunes are played. -Plenty of sauces, in squeeze bottles at your table to satisfy the sauce lover in all of us. -Since most items are made fresh to order, don't be surprised if you have a bit of a wait.  There are too many fake BBQ spots in Charlotte.  Too many BBQ spots in the BBQ business because its the cool thing to do in the state of North Carolina.  Too many spots that are BBQ restaurants in name only!  Not Sauceman's, this place is as real as real can get!",

The hushpuppies used to be my favorite but today and during my last visit they were hard as a brick, cold and dry on the inside. The ONLY reason why I didn't give them ZERO stars, if that's possible, is because the BBQ is decent. I ordered a BBQ sandwich and the bread was soggy but none the less the actual coarse chopped BBQ was decent.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in to Saucemans for dinner on Saturday. He went with the pork plate and I had the Southern Belle sandwich. He liked his bbq though said it didn't quite have the smokey flavor he prefers. My sandwich was HUGE and definitely tasty. I pulled off some of the pork and sampled the many table-side sauces;  all of which I enjoyed. I have to second Suzy S. and say the mac n cheese was awesome, but we didn't care for the coleslaw which had some sweet pickle in it (just not our thing).   The food itself is an easy 4 stars but I would most likely never dine-in again. The place is full of windows and I literally felt like I was baking in the sun. I was rushing to finish my meal because I was so uncomfortable. Considering I am always cold, I couldn't even imagine how some of the other more hot-natured patrons must have felt. Saucemans needs to invest in a better AC-unit or some blinds.   My other issue is that everything felt sticky and gross. They need to do a better job making sure they clean the caddies (containing all the sauces, seasonings, and menu)  on the table. I realize bbq sauce makes for sticky hands, but they need to make sure they are cleaning these as well as the tables as new diners sit down.",

Not as dry as what I've had from Mac's Speed Shop but the smokiness reminds me of the Dickey's Barbecue Pit chain. I suspect liquid smoke is used here.  Also, judging from people's photos on Yelp and my own experience Sauceman's cannot consistently make BBQ slaw the right way. Mine was like chopped cabbage drowning in Kansas City BBQ sauce.  On the plus side, their banana pudding is good.",

The first time around I tried getting a sampling of a few meats and the highlight here is obviously the pork. Unfortunately I was thoroughly disappointed by the chicken as it was very very dry.   The sauces are all great. You can't beat a big plate of the coarse chopped pork with a slathering of various sauces. This order will certainly be my go-to moving forward.  The last time I was here I witnessed some great sandwiches from the grill which look incredible. One of particular interest to me is the roasted turkey with Granny Smith apples and bacon (I think a cheese too). I'll be snagging this one next time.  Overall a great little spot with some great pork barbecue at a very very reasonable price. Highly recommend.",

Lay off the sauce for the first bites and let all the notes of the smoked turkey, the sliced apple, the applewood bacon, and the (equally thoughtful) texas toast just play around a little.  You'll be glad you did.  Then put a sauce out for dipping - don't put it on the sandwich...trust me.  You don't want to mask anything going on here.  Coupled with their collard greens (which are on the sweet side - not in a bad way), this was a very filling and fantastic lunch.  We're going back again soon!",

    "text": "This review covers my first and only experience here so far.  The emphasis is on what I enjoyed the most, though I'm rating everything.  When I'm visiting a place for the first time I want to experience as much as reasonably possible and some of what is unreasonably possible.  In a place like this it is going to be difficult not to break the diet and when POPROCK LOVE is doing the ordering it may be better to forget it anyway!  Small and tight or cozy and intimate?  How about: \"Hello would it be alright if we share your table\" or \"is anyone sitting hear, OK we are\".  I actually LOVE dinning with strangers, only here the strangers are not going to be strange at lunchtime on a week day.  That is OK too and I'm with POPROCK LOVE so who cares what these other people are talking about!  Starting with my favorite at Sauceman's: Best Collard Greens I have ever tasted 5 yelp stars!  Vinegar Sauce - this is a very simple version and one of my favorites, thin and spicy with great flavor 5 yelp stars.  FRESH Hush-puppies ok forget the diet super delicious 4.5 stars.  Red Slaw (no Mayo YAY!) good flavor 4.25 stars.    We are not just here for the BBQ, though since I LOVE Great BBQ it is an important part of the review.  We split (I always eat more) one small BBQ tray of Coarse Chopped Pork BBQ.  The Flavor was very good, not great.  It was too Fatty for me. Still the flavor was very good 3.9 stars (only because I'm not quite a fan).  The rest of this review is where I was disappointed:  The Mac and Cheese was almost A-OK (would not get it again) almost 3 stars.  The Fried Green Tomatoes had great flavor though the Batter was way too thick 3 stars.  The Fried Pickles lacked flavor and again the thickness of the batter ruined it for me 2 stars.  I like BBQ Sauces and Sauceman's has one - the other two I was very disappointed in.  If a place has one great sauce that is all I need, so to me it is no big deal that I did not care for Sauceman's (too Mustardy) Mustard, nor (too sweet) Sweet BBQ sauces, someone else may think they are perfect.",

I always get The Pig which includes a generous portion of slow smoked pork, slaw, two hush puppies, and a side.  At some barbecue places the meat is the star with lack luster sides.

Like all BBQ places these days the prices are a little steep for the portions but phew I was pretty shocked at the side of Mac and Cheese that was $3.50 and in a tiny ramekin! We got servers sides to share and the other sides were there times the size and cheaper. That was a bit annoying and I really think they need to re-evaluate that! The BBQ itself was great I loved the smoke flavor, I had a few little charred ends on my chopped sandwich which was yum! They offer two sauces to use on the tables. One was SUPER vinegar and the other was a Golden BBQ, kinda surprised they didn't have one more that was more of a Hickory/Sweet or Spicy. I thought the sauces fell flat! I found the side item choices really interesting for a BBQ joint, Fried Green Tomatoes (which they give you Ranch for) and Deep fried Corn were both awesome! The service was great and the service told us to have \"Blessed Day\" which is just a True southern hospitality thing to say!   I would return to this place but I wouldn't call it a favorite because there is such tough competition around them!",

Fried green tomatoes, baked beans, onion rings, slaw, and hush puppies. All seemed fresh and were quite good. BUT... The chicken was very dry, including the dark meat, and the pork was dry no matter how much sauce you added.  When leaving I noticed there was no exhaust coming from the building.

So gross we couldn't eat...half was pure fat and the rest had such huge veins of fat there was no way to eat around the fat.  I contacted them via their website explaining my order.  I never heard back from them.  This is the second takeout with a major problem.  Never again!  I'll travel further to get a takeout elsewhere.",

I was very happy that I acted on my urge to go back after many many years.  I used to live closer to the location, so I had order take out a time or two.  I remember it was pretty good, but not as great as it was tonight!  The brisket was as tasty as it gets.  Nice bark and packed with flavor.  My child could not stop eating it!  The slaw and collards were notable, and since I started this draft, I have gone back and ordered again, and it was consistent in the seasoning and appeal.  The sides are definitely memorable, which you do not always get at a BBQ establishment.  The BBQ is a True Eastern N.C. style barbecue, and was  perfectly prepared.  The self serve pork rinds in a popcorn machine, while you wait for you food is a fun touch!",

All the other brisket was moist and very tasty.The mac & cheese elevates everything to 5 stars, just incredible. I snacked on a pork rind & immediately asked for a bag to take home. Might be the best pork rinds in my life. Slaw & hush puppies are very good. Second visit was pulled pork plate with fried green tomatoes. This is my favorite of the two meats we have tried, very well prepared and lots of pork! The fried green tomatoes were perfect. This time we got a pound of the mac & cheese with another sack of pork rinds. Definitely one our go too places for great food. Both times had it as takeout and was packed very nice for travelling.",

    "text": "Sunday September 9, 2018.--So frustrated with this restaurant.  I have had at least 3 situations where I have received the worst service at the counter, basically no one ever seems to know what is going on.  Today takes the cake. My 79 year old mother, visiting from WV, wanted me to take her to Sauceman's and pick up  potato salad to go.  She loves their side dishes and swears by the potato salad.  We get to the restaurant at 4:03 on a Sunday afternoon, Panther home game.  She goes to the door and there is a sign that states they are closing at 4.  Info not on FB or website.  She asks the lady at the door if she could sell her some potato salad.  Woman states that they closed at 4 (3 minutes before) and that they probably sold out of everything.  She did not bother to check or offer any empathy that we had driven all the way to the restaurant to find it closed.  She was so unprofessional.  She closed and locked the door.  Before we drove away, another man came up to the door and was frustrated that the restaurant was closed.  Glad business is so good that you can make up your hours day to day.  Good luck to you as you have just lost good customers from Dilworth.  Midwood Smokehouse is better bbq anyway.  You could offer local convenience, but unfortunately don't.",

    "text": "Oh Saucemans. I pass by you every day when I'm heading to work. I made a very illegal u-turn on Camden and East to come and eat here for lunch. Here is my take on the place.  I love barbecue. I'm a southern boy.. what do you expect? So I'm used to Mac's Speed Shop and other places, but I was very surprised by this place! You order when you walk in, not when you sit down. There's a huge board full of options for you to choose from. I got the pig plate. It's.. pig. And I also got extra meat. My side was Mac and cheese, and it also came with slaw. Oh.. and being that this is Charlotte, you HAVE to get a beer, right?  Alright. So I sit down at the bar, they grab my beer, and I wait probably 20-25 minutes for my food. At Mac's, I'm used to it coming out pretty quick. Anyways, my food comes out. VERY good portions of meat. A small side of Mac and cheese, and same size side of slaw. By the way, you can choose between red or white slaw.  The pork and Mac and cheese was good. Just that. It came out warm, and didn't seem fresh. The taste and tenderness was there.. but I was expecting a little bit more. And being that it's lunch time.. you'd think that the food would be hot and fresh, since they're going through a lot in a small period of time. Well, not so much. The slaw was fantastic though!  All in all, the wait staff as attentive, the service was prompt, and I got to watch replays of Thursday Night Football at the bar, tipsy. Will I be back, yes.. but I hope the temperature of the food is a little better than what it was.",

The lady taking the orders was very nice and helpful. However, this place suffers from what I call a 'lazy kitchen'.  They do not allow you to modify any plates at all. No substitutions for anything on the menu. Furthermore, if you have an allergy and need something taken out of an item, forget it, they will not accommodate. Related to this, we tried to get a sandwich with no cheese on it but they told is the sandwiches are pre-made and they cannot remove the cheese or make new ones.  That makes me think that the sandwiches are not really fresh and they have a stack of them made from either earlier in the morning or possibly the day before.  In any case, not a super deal breaker for me but disappointing they offer no flexibility on the menu.",

    "text": "Some of the best BBQ I've had in Charlotte so far. I have been here twice. First time I got the course chopped BBQ tray. This was very good, authentic eastern style BBQ served with decent white slaw & great, sweet hush puppies. (I love the sweet hush puppies!) It is hard to find good, authentic BBQ in Charlotte, glad I found somewhere that hits the mark (I am a BBQ snob, grew up in Raleigh / Durham area) Macs is good but not authentic for those that don't know about NC BBQ....  The second time I came I just had to try the BBQ sandwich where the bun is a huge hush puppy (I think it's called the Big Squeal). This was a mistake I won't make again - not good at all, almost sickening. The hush puppy bun was greasy, thick & overwhelming, also hard to eat. (I just ate the BBQ off the sandwich) I think (know) from now on I'll stick to the traditional fare. No need to experiment with wacky ideas like that. With BBQ it just needs to be simple. I did try the brunswick stew (or pig slop as they call it) that day though & it was pretty good. (No one in Charlotte seems to know how to make an authentic brunswick stew either but this was really close)   The service both times was very friendly. It is in somewhat of a sketchy neighborhood (between uptown & West Blvd.) but don't let that throw you off. I've seen everyday working people, business people, lawyers etc. in here. Seating is minimal also. I tried to come here last week and it was packed so went elsewhere.",

Well, after eating at Sauceman's a few nights ago, I am compelled to leave a few words.  We arrived pretty late but were warmly welcomed and didn't feel rushed at all. Being pizza fanatics, we tried the Combo pizza and were thoroughly impressed! The ingredients were fresh and held the pizza together very nicely, and unlike a few pizza joints around town, the pizza wasn't flopping around with grease.   The guy who brought our food out was friendly and attentive. We tried the sugar donut balls and although I normally don't care for sweets, these were a perfect finish to our meal. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu but I might have to order another pizza first.",

I feel like I'm unable to get the proper meat to sauce ratio. My friend ordered the pulled pork, & he loved it. I would like to go back & try the ribs or pork. Also I ordered sides of Mac n cheese & collard greens. I wouldn't particularly recommend either... especially the collards, they were extremely bland.",

The onion rings and white slaw were good. The service was fine. We went for lunch on a Friday. They have a nice side patio. The parking is definitely limited and tricky to get to from I-77. I thought turning right at the light and going in from Tryon St would be best, but it's a one-way parking lot going the other way. It looked like they had another lot if you drive past it on West Blvd and turn in. Overall, a good experience, but I still prefer Midwood Smokehouse.",

We joked around that early guy must have been about 45 minutes late this morning. Since everyone else said how tender the meat was when they had it.

While I am not southern, to me, their chopped barbeque is delicious. Somebody in that kitchen knows how to fry: fried onion rings are the best in town as is their fried sugar biscuits (blindfolded they taste the same as donuts just shaped differently). These are the best donuts in town, bar  none. Now how I almost got my double order for free; they were surprised when I asked for a double order. They thought I did not understand that an order consisted of five donuts. I was told if I could eat them all I would not be charged for them. Unfortunately my wife heard them and said no way. I will be back there within a week sans wife and I will down those ten sugared marvels and be glad to pay for them. They were that good. I did go back and I paid for a double order and ate them. My scale was sad but I was glad.",

    "text": "WOW.   Everyone has been waiting for some authentic NC BBQ here in Charlotte, and they don't realize it's been hiding at Sauceman's. On my visit, this place totally under-promised, and over-delivered. I really like the fact that they are not only trying to provide a quality product, but also explain the roots of North Carolina barbeque, which I haven't really seen executed before.   However---on to the food.   I feel like with any new trip to a barbeque establishment, one must always order a pulled pork sandwich, and I was no different. Mine came with a (small) side of white slaw, and I also ordered an additional side of mac & cheese. Let me say that I was at the BBQ & blues festival a few months back, and this pork can place up with the best of them. It was so good, I couldn't help myself just piling the slaw on top of the sandwich and just go after both of them at the same time. The mac & cheese was also killer; definitely homemade & put together with care.   This place epitomizes southern barbeque, with clearly time tested recipes, and just plain 'ole good food...we went with a group of 4, and had no food left behind.   Our experience was truly worthy of 5 stars.",

The manager could tell how disappointed I was and asked me how much time I had. I told him I would be happy to wait, and he proceeded to keep the grill fired up so I could go home happy. It was well past six when I left. It's a small restaurant and small lot, but don't let that deter you. There's big flavor to look forward to once you get inside.",

    "text": "This place is a skip (or realistically speaking, 1.5 miles or 5 mins drive straight down Tryon per google) away from my office yet I never been there.  I believe it was a pizza joint at one point, but apparently since then reincarnated into a BBQ joint.  I am not a big BBQ fan, never have a craving for it but then I can put away some meat if I must.  First tasting of sauceman's foods came from an office catered lunch.  I was impressed by the mac and cheese.  You know it's good when people were scrapping the foil pan.  So today for lunch I decided to give the place a try in person.    Warning: parking is horrific for lunch crowd.  The lot is small at a busy intersection.  I was hungry and hungry folks don't think or drive straight. I felt like I am in a hunger game southend version. We literally just \"parked\" the car at the curb next to some shrubberies.   The place is tiny, and it was packed. The moment we walked in the building, there was a line formed for ordering.  Since it's first time visit, I had no clue if I am in a fast food joint or full service joint. A little confusing. Well, fast food it is. The stack of menu hangs on the wall.  The line moved quickly, meaning unless you know the menu already, otherwise you have limited time to decide.    Menu offering: regular chopped BBQ sandwich or tray or plate, brisket, ribs (but apparently not available at all times, they said the ribs are being cooked down the street... Huh?), specialty sandwiches, sides/veggies plate, wings, and tailgate package.  Food arrived in decent time frame.  Waitress explained the sauces on the table (sweet, Carolina vinegar and mustard based). Food looked appetizing on a big round tray.  My sweet smoke sandwich consists of pulled pork with cheddar, bacon and grinny smith apple slices served between two Texas toasts.  Sounded good. Good portion as well.  However besides the pork and cheese I couldn't taste the other items. I wonder if the apple slices are a little thicker if that would come out more.  And i don't know why I couldn't taste the bacon, i saw it, but they were thin.  Pork was moist and had flavor.  I ended up using a little of the octane mustard sauce and the sweet BBQ sauce to help juice it up.  My (big) side mac and cheese was still good.  Yes it was lumpy but the pasta was moist and had good flavor.  Definitely not from a box. $8.50 is reasonably priced.   My bf ordered brisket plate. It came with red or white slaw.  We got the red, because I remember it was better than the mayo based from catered lunch. This time it tasted good but very watery.  Chopped cabbage price went up? Brisket came with 2 slices of Texas toasts instead of hushpuppies, more filling in my opinion, and a side.  We tried the fried corn. Holy macaroni it was salty.  Someone went crazy with the seasoning shaker.  But I dipped it in the slaw sauce, and the sweet and tartness washed the sodium off.  I liked the corn otherwise. The brisket was a little fatty.  I wouldn't mind but he likes his brisket lean...which means lots of the meat got left aside.  No worried, I finished them :). But does this worth $11.50... A little overpriced in my book, since the portion isnt that big.   Service for what it is was good.  The cashier guy shorted me $2 on the coupon (btw, they have coupons on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvalpak.com&s=a4b9310bd024d60c89d634669302b8292f9216dfd3420329f5ff3d1fe568b836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">valpak.com</a>) and when I asked him, he was nice about it.  They came by and asked how everything was.    Conclusion: This place is worthy of a visit. I am not an expert in BBQ, can't say if this is the best or worst but it's solid quality. And sorry, I think it's better than Mac's, which is just overrated in my opinion.",

    "text": "HOLY CRAP!!!!  This place is amazing!  This is, hands down, the BEST BBQ I have had so far in Charlotte. Why, you ask, did I not give them 5 stars?  Well, my overall experience there was great, but not perfect.  I have to reserve that 5th star for absolute culinary nirvana! Sauceman's comes damn close.   I ordered the Big Squeal.  It's chopped BBQ pork on a bun made of 2\" thick cornbread.  They say it's a hush puppy, but it's not savory like one.  It's more of a sweet, dense cornbread.  It makes the perfect bun!  I could only eat half the sandwich; it's BIG.   The sauces:  I tried the Octane and the Sweet Love Smoke (or something like that).  Both were very good! Sides:  Onion rings were good - not crispy, but not previously frozen, either.  These had to be hand-battered on-site.  Also, the sweet potato casserole is excellent.  I think there are raisins in it; whatever they were, I loved it. The dude working the register was nice, helpful, and made our experience complete. The only downside:  the place is tiny, and the lunch crowd overflows the place.  Also, there are only a few parking places, so that can be a pain. I highly recommend this place; the food makes any parking hassle worthwhile!  Update - 2/24/12 - Went back today for lunch, only to find out that the Big Squeal has been stricken from the menu.  I had a BBQ chicken/ribs combo, which was good, but no better than McKoy's or other BBQ places.  They also eliminated the sweet potato casserole, which I loved.  It is as if they systematically removed all my favorite items from their menu.  I won't drive 3 extra miles to go here anymore, when McKoy's, Mac's, Hillbilly's, and 50 other BBQ places are closer to me.",

    "text": "I am always on the lookout for new places to try in and around Charlotte.  So when one of my employer's clients suggested that I try Sauceman's in Charlotte, I decided to give it a shot.  When I first pulled up the website, I saw that they also did pizza and grill-style foods in addition to BBQ.  I was a little concerned (unjustifiably so) in that the 'que here was going to be sub-par.  Then I continued reading through their site to find out more about them.  Sauceman's was founded in 2010 and specializes in North Carolina style BBQ (Lexington style, to be specific).  It is located in the South End district of Charlotte, NC  at the corner of Tryon St. and West Blvd.  At Sauceman's, you place your order and pay for it, and then your order is brought out to you.  After browsing the menu for a bit, I decided to order the coarse chopped BBQ plate (which comes with hush puppies and slaw) with potato salad as my side of choice.  Less than five minutes after paying for my order, out comes my plate.  One bite into the pork, and my taste buds jumped for joy!  This was some of the most flavorful and moist pork that I have tasted.  There were nice big chunks of bark in the pork that were super tasty, and the meat itself was very moist!  The slaw (a red slaw -- white slaw is also available) was very vinegary and peppery.  It may be a little too vinegary and peppery if you are not used to this style of slaw.  The potato salad was very delicious, with nice large pieces of potatoes that weren't overly slathered.  The hush puppies were very large and very crispy!  I got to speak with Zach Goodyear, the pitmaster for Sauceman's.  We had a very pleasant conversation and talked about some of the many good things in store for Sauceman's.  After speaking with him, I decided to take a look at their sauces.  There are three different sauces available -- a vinegar-based sauce, a sweet tomato-based sauce, and a mustard-based sauce.  The vinegar-based sauce (not pictured) was a classic eastern-Carolina style vinegar sauce that was very tasty.  It  would work very well as a dipping sauce for the pork, if so desired.  The tomato-based sauce was very, very sweet with predominant flavors of brown sugar and molasses.  The mustard-based sauce was also sweet, although not as sweet as the tomato-based sauce.  It also had a little bit of kick to it in terms of spice and heat, though not enough to be overpowering and predominant.  I was getting ready to leave when I saw this beast of a sandwich show up at a neighboring table.  The \"Clark Griswald\" stands at a whopping 3 lbs of pork (although the guy working the register told me that it was 4 lbs) and is served with slaw, hush puppies, and choice of side.  And if you can finish this beast in 30 minutes or less, it's on the house.  Otherwise, it's $14.99.  That's still a heckuva deal for that much pig!!  I can gladly say that I will be adding Sauceman's to my list of places to visit over and over again for BBQ in Charlotte, and I suggest that you should too!  Sauceman's is located at 228 West Blvd., Charlotte, NC 28202.  Their website is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saucemans.com&s=a4fe99ff3c3ab3399a7c06d1621b1d1a700a79c59f82d2524c13c93998a37dea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">saucemans.com</a>.

I'm still working my way through it, but from the \"Sauceman's Original\" to \"The Big Squeal\" and back, I've never been disappointed.   There are dozen's of BBQ joints where you can get a stock pulled pork sandwich (Mac's is still my favorite), but only one place where BBQ takes a road trip through the South and comes back with souvenirs.   The menu is very reasonably priced given the really absurd amount of food you'll get.   Sauceman's just barely misses out on the fifth star because service is a little haphazard. I think this is partially because it's a really small place with an awkward layout - the folks there are about as nice as you'll find anywhere.  Oh yeah... and don't forget to get yourself some of the Arnold Palmer!",

Parking is difficult.  To be fair, this was months ago.  Maybe they have figured things out by now.",

At the end of the hour it was still cold and when thighs were pulled away, it was not close to done!  We have smoked meats for years and know that it can have a pink tinge - this was raw, red, juicy, not shredding meat and just disgusting!  We had to take it apart and put the pieces in the oven to cook it fully. - and then it was dry.  Needless to say, our Thanksgiving was delayed and the fine art of getting everything ready at once was thrown off.  I can't imagine how they could send out an under cooked turkey!!!  I hope others didn't have this problem and that no one was sick from eating under cooked turkey!  I hope our wonderful hosts get most of their money back for this fiasco!!",

    "text": "Sauceman's is serving up some seriously tasty smoked meat.   The menu is pretty classic. Pick your meat, decide if you want a sammie or a platter, choose between red or white cole slaw, and then pick a side and a cold brew to wash everything down with.  I went with a pulled pork sandwich with white cole slaw and a side of potato salad. The sandwich was overflowing with some of the most delicious and juicy pork that I've tasted. The meat isn't served with any sauce, and instead you can choose from a variety of different sauces that sit on the table. I actually liked how the sauce and cole slaw came on the side. Usually when the sandwich is loaded with everything it's messy and tough to eat. So, it was nice to assemble the toppings myself.   Prices are fair, and for 5 bucks you are getting an absolutely huge sandwich. Food is ordered at the counter, and everything came out within a matter of minutes. My trip to Charlotte was a short one, but I'm really glad that I was able to snag some authentic BBQ while I was there. If you are looking to do the same while visiting Charlotte, then make sure to hit up Sauceman's.",

I liked Sauceman's better than Midwood Smokehouse based solely on the chicken and pulled pork as they were out of Brisket at 5:30.  Great atmosphere with live music playing and you can choose to order at the counter or sit at the bar for full service.    Descent selection of beers and top notch Que! The pulled pork and ribs had great smoked flavor and were well seasoned.  The St.Louis Style ribs were moist and and meaty. The pulled pork was spot on and the smoked chicken hit the spot.  Three sauce options including Eastern Carolina Vinegar, Western Carolina with tomato and a mustard based sauce.  Sides included house battered onion rings, house cut fries and baked beans. Several other options including Mac and cheese, slaw and potato salad on the menu as well.  I look forward to my next trip to Sauceman's!

The latter, worst I've ever tried (I couldn't eat them)  White slaw, or cabbage in pure vinegar?   Collards, or greens in pure vinegar?  Saving grace was the potato salad which was edible but I could get that from food lion.

Sauce was decent. Potato salad tasted like it came from Walmart Deli. Baked beans were pretty tasty, but not worth $3 as an additional side. Initially ordered mac n' cheese, but they were \"out of it\" at 10AM (explains potato salad order)? Red slaw was unique and pretty good for a vinegar based slaw. Hush puppies had an okay flavor, but were cold and really dry.   $16 later, I was left full, but really wishing I hadn't spent that much money on lunch from here. Save your money and go to Midwood or Mac's Speed Shop. You'll pay the same if not less and get much better food and larger selection.",

Decided to give it a try. My friend that was with me was trying to steer me away from getting the full rack and then the lady at register was reluctant about pressing some extra buttons on the register to change the order and I was confused as to what to get because everything is kind of separate and then they were out of some items so basically I got a full rack of ribs and that was entirely way too much. But it was tasty, they could have been served hot for a bonus. At the time we were the only customers in the restaurant and basically we got kicked out because they turned off the lights and literally were leaving even though the restaurant wasn't supposed to be closed for awhile. I just think if they improve a few things they would have a lot more customers",

If you post your hours, you should adhere to them! what a rude thing to continuously do to your customer base!   They also regularly \"sell out\" of food, which results in them closing early. If you so often run out of food, isn't that a red flag that you are running your business poorly? Do some simple math, plan ahead, and have enough food. This is simple supply and demand.   Like i said, the food is great, but the way this place is managed just DOES NOT make sense, and it is getting frustrating.

The service is lackluster and slow, the meat is all good portions but I've had much better elsewhere in Charlotte (and to be clear, we've tried most of the meat options here twice now), and the sides are way overpriced for the skimpy little portions they give you. The pork is bland and dry on its own - good bbq shouldn't have to rely on sauce for flavor. The brisket was fatty and dry somehow (and almost half the piece we got was pure fat - bleh!). The chicken was the only redeeming meat this place has.   As for the sides, the ridiculously small side of slaw that came with my pork sandwhich (served in a 1oz plastic condiment cup) was fine but nothing amazing. The beans were dry (like they'd been sitting till they formed a 'crust' on top) but had flavor (and heat surprisingly). The onion rings are cooked really well, but WAY salty. The hush-puppies are literally the best things that Sauceman's has to offer it seems. And charging $0.50 for an extra plastic 1oz of bbq?! Give me a break.   Save your time and just go to Midwood Smokehouse if you want really great (and consistent) bbq with good portions and good service. And if you're in a rush, go to Midwood Smokeshack or even City BBQ. Any of those are better than Sauceman's.",

Being from Texas I have had amazing brisket and unfortunately  Sauceman's brisket was not very notable. The brisket needed more fat since the meat wasn't very moist and flavorful. Same for the pork, which was too lean and dry. The hush puppies were really good and crispy. The mac & cheese was interesting...I can't say I would order that again.

    "text": "A few years ago, a friend of mine in South Florida told me about a fantastic BBQ restaurant  in Charlotte, North Carolina known as \"Sauceman's.\" Fast forward a few years, and I had the opportunity to try it out.  Sauceman's is located a couple of miles south of the Downtown area about 10-minutes or so depending on traffic. I truly love the taste of real pit  BBQ. I have had good BBQ in most every state in the south...Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and of course Florida. Each state and restaurant  offer their own individual twist and \"secrets\" that makes their BBQ flavor unique. I have had very good BBQ in every state that I mentioned.   And now...\"The Gold Standard\"...Sauceman's ! Without a doubt they have the best brisket, chicken, and ribs that I have ever tasted. Not even close. It is incredibly good. Full flavor, moist, smoke, color...all just ideal. My personal favorite is their brisket sandwich with fries and baked beans. No cutting corners, nothing rushed, quality only. The proof is in the rich flavor. Sauceman's gives you plenty of food for your money makes it a good value too. If you like cold beer to go with your BBQ, I highly recommend a draft Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Sure, you will need a forklift to extract yourself after your meal, but life does not offer any do-overs, so when you are in the mood for BBQ, you cannot do better.   I might also add that the young ladies that take the orders are genuinely nice and are very knowledgeable about the menu in case you have any questions. There are three or four BBQ sauces on the table to give you some variety if you want to add any of them to your BBQ. A couple a flat screen TVs and you are set for the duration of your visit. If there is better tasting BBQ anywhere, I want to know about it. But until I discover one better, it's \"all hail to Sauceman's.\"",

    "text": "I'd heard a lot of dry reviews about Sauceman's when it first opened, but recently, the scuttlebut has been wet with praise.  They've been doing a lot of promotion in the Valu-Pak mailers, so I grabbed our buy-one-get-one-free coupon, and off we went.    Located in South End, Sauceman's was slightly off the beaten path (South Blvd.), but still close enough to have some character.  The parking lot is pretty small and gravel, and once inside, the layout is slightly awkward.  You order at the register, using hanging menu boards above or paper printed tri-fold menus to decide what you want, kitchen window directly to your right, seating area 1 just behind you, and seating area 2 behind the register (and yes, seating area 2 is where you'll find the drinks).  After ordering, you're given a number and can select your seat; food will be brought out to you.  Two sandwiches ordered later, we were ready to stuff our faces - and stuff our faces we did.  I got the Southern Belle with turkey, which came out on texas toast, covered in boursin cheese, and layered with more turkey than I consume at Thanksgiving (and yes, the fried green tomatoes atop were delicious); the side of macaroni and cheese, bless it's heart, looks a bit odd, but sure does taste good.  My boyfriend got the Cheesy Sauceman with brisket, and said the brisket was the best he's had outside of Texas; six hushpuppies adorned the full plate.  As good as our sandwiches were, there's a few more from the menu that I'm eyeing and will be trying next time... because there will be a next time.  The Sauceman returneth!",

Place wasn't packed but the staff was quite friendly. I ordered the half-rack of ribs combo that came with slaw and hushpuppies with mac & cheese. I'm not a big fan of slaw so I asked them if I could substitute. Their answer was flat-out NO. :/ Anyways, when I did get my food, the mac & cheese was delicious. I remember eating it at Taste of Charlotte but the ribs weren't fall-off-the-bone which I favor but they did have a nice flavor to them. The hushpuppies were pretty good as well.. but the only thing is that they only gave me TWO. Two?! Why?! Everyone else had a helping but I only get two?! Urgh. I can't comment on the slaw because apparently, \"substitute the slaw please\" meant no slaw given.  For dessert, we ordered the famous \"sugar biscuits\" and being Asian, I noticed they are exactly like chinese donuts or \"youtiao\"... I was expecting real biscuits.  I'm giving this a 3 stars, however, because the sweet tea lemonade is the BOMB! Sooooooooooo gooooooooood. Best Arnold Palmer I've had yet.",

The hush puppies looked good but were soooo dry inside... Yikes! I got a side of baked beans but nothing special either. Tasted right out the can. The BBQ was very yummy however I am a fan of vinegar sauces but Not theirs. Not good at all. But the mustard based was very delicious.

The pork is already cooked - it has been for hours, that's how it has to be with bbq, and the french fries take 3 minutes to drop in a fryer even if they aren't already done. People who got there 5 mins before us were completely gone from the restaurant before we got our food.  I'd give the sauces 2 stars, the pork 3 stars, and the service / overall experience 1.5 stars.",

All three were absolutely delicious, as were the bbq sauces. Great smoky flavor in the meat. The sides we had were baked beans, potato salad, deep fried corn on the cob, and fried green tomatoes. The beans and salad were fairly standard. The tomatoes, though fried, were tasty and delicious, especially with the sauce they provided. But best of all was the corn on the cob. Never had it deep fried before. Absolutely delectable. Not greasy or oily at all. Love this place!",

I ordered the Hoff Dog--a smoked Texas hot link made in house on a hot dog bun--with a side of white cole slaw. I'm not sure why it's described as a Texas hot link? I'm from Texas and I've never had a sausage like this before. There was fennel seed in it which gave it an Italian sausage taste. The slaw was ok--it's a mayonnaise based slaw but it wasn't overly mayonnaise-y.   I tasted my friend's pulled pork and hush puppy and they were both ok also.

But once I dove in, a few problems arose.   1.  The brisket had this hard, jerky like edge all they way around. I am familiar with burnt ends on brisket, but this was chewy and dry.   2.  The brisket was dry in places and needed a dousing in the sauce after a slice with the knife. My experience is that the best brisket just falls apart. And some of this brisket did fall apart at the touch of my fork.   3. The vinegar based bbq sauce was just too runny. How do you shake up an open container??   Now, there were also several successes:  1. The white coleslaw is full of flavor. It is both crunchy and slaw like with a strong flavor of mayo and hints of vinegar. I ate it all and dipped my fries in the leftover liquid.   2. The pickles and onions were a nice touch and very tasty. Super fresh.   3. The two tomato based sauces and the pork rinds. Delightful and tasty.",

A thick slice of beef that was quite \"moist\" and I cut that bit off and to set it to the side.  The hush puppies were excellent, the pickles and bits of onion were yummy. Mac & cheese was a very sharp cheese that was delicious.  Coke fountain, urns of sweet and unsweet tea, they also have a bar with bottled and draft beer including locally brewed beers.

    "text": "My friends and I came to Sauceman's for a Saturday afternoon lunch. We're so excited to try it after hearing such great things. The waitress at the counter was super helpful. She was warm and friendly and had genuine suggestions when you asked. Her personality is bubbly and she took our order efficiently.   After we ordered, she also offered us free pork rinds while we waited. They were pretty decent. You can tell they were fresh and seasoned with just a little bit of seasoning salt. They were also kept warm and accessible for people to eat as many as they wanted while waiting. Before we can could refill the pork rinds, our meal was coming out. Perfect timing.   I ordered the sampler with mac & cheese and onion rings . My friend ordered the pulled pork with the fried corn and coleslaw my other friend ordered the brisket with the potato salad and coleslaw.   The brisket was absolutely divine. Very tender and juicy and perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was most certainly the star of the show. The chicken, sausage and pulled pork were also good to but second to the  brisket. Their macaroni and cheese and fried corn are definitely the must try sides. The mac was well executed and perfectly seasoned. The fried corn was the wild card. Fried and buttery deliciousness with the same texture and sweetness as grilled corn. My friend who got the potato salad and coleslaw said they were pretty good as well.   All their sides are vegetarian which is great and a real rarity at a barbecue joint. Some of the sides (potato salad and coleslaw are prepared without gluten-containing ingredients. This is a great option for a group of people with a variety of diets. In our group alone we had no pork and gluten-free and everyone was still able to eat something and be satisfied.  So you may be wondering, \"Why the heck did she give this place two stars?!\" Welp, it was not because of the food or the service in that initial visit but because we returned today to partake in their delicious food again, we were met with a locked door.   There's a huge sign outside touting their new extended hours (11 am-9pm) and a new schedule on that door states the same. When arrived it was before 8:30pm. When we pulled on the door it was 8:30pm exactly. When I motioned for her, a waitress opened door and told us that they were closed.   When I said that the sign on the door and outside said nine, she said, \"I don't know why but my manager just said were closed. Sorry.\" They offered no atonement or reasoning for why we were not allowed in. There were still other patrons eating inside.    On a gorgeous day like it was, we weren't even going to eat in, but rather order takeout and go eat it at the park. We were very disappointed to say the least and didn't expect an establishment where we had such a great first experience to turn shady on us. They lost out on revenue from a party of four who love to eat, our wood of mouth endorsements and the possible loss of our continued patronage.",

It's way better than Mac's Speedshop now. The decor of the restaurant changed a little and it's really well done now. There's a lot of wood incorporated and a garage door leading out to the patio. They added sauce options so now you have the choice between vinegar, mustard, and smokey bbq sauces. The vinegar and mustard were my favorite, but the smokey was also good. They also have complimentary pork skins now which were very good.   We got the South End Combo with pulled pork, brisket, chicken, mac and cheese, and baked beans. I think the brisket was the best I've ever had. It had a really tastey char around the edge. The pulled pork was also very good. The chicken was my least favorite. The outside was good (a little spicy), but the inside was a little dry. The hush puppies are now my favorite in Charlotte (since Mac's change their recipe). We finished up with the sugar biscuits which were very good - light, sugar coated, donut like balls.  This is a must try restaurant in Charlotte that I highly recommend!",

We are considering doing their catering for our rehearsal dinner, so we wanted to try the food. We walked in and met the manager, and he was so kind to us. We wanted to try a wide range of things, so he told us he would make something special for us.   He came out with basically two cookie sheets full of food. One was full of meat and the other was full of sides. We got to try pork, brisket, half a chicken, fried green tomatoes, onion rings, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, collard greens!  I was blown away by how good the food was. It was also fun to try different sauces. They have vinegar sauce, mustard-based sauce, more original sauce, and even an Alabama white sauce. My favorite items were probably the brisket, onion rings, baked beans, and their macaroni and cheese. The chicken was super moist as well! Their macaroni and cheese is very creamy and not dry and baked like most.  The food and hospitality were amazing and we will definitely be back. Definitely consider them for your catering needs!",

My friend bailed early, perhaps claiming the ladylike non-greedy protocol many small, weight watching women gravitate to, lol.  Anyway,  this proved a fun, delicious time...

    "text": "After getting out with some great friends of ours for the first time in a while, we decided to take them to Sauceman's. I'm a huge BBQ fan and Sauceman's was one of the places left on my list in town. Though this location doesn't seem to be much from the outside, it definitely holds a firm place in my BBQ-loving soul amongst the other varietals in town.   I had passed by this little building so many times on my way in and out of Uptown and always wanted to stop in. It's pretty small inside with some tables and a walk-up counter to order at.   We started with some fried pickles and onion rings. Fried Pickles are somewhat of a ubiquitous app in town. Throw a stone in any direction and there is a joint that serves em the same as a few others in town. They weren't really anything to write home about. I actually wasn't too thrilled with the flavor and only ate a couple. The onion rings were great. Thick, but battered cooked correctly so you don't end up pulling out the entire onion from the inside of the batter housing. Well done here, ladies and gents in the kitchen.   I ordered the thick cut pork. Nice chunks of pork and a nice change of pace from my typical goings of the chopped variety. I really enjoyed the larger pieces and eating them with a fork and knife. The flavor was fantastic and their Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce was a stupendous addition. The hushpuppies they serve with each meal are some of the best I've had in town. Huge ones, too. Not small like others I've had, which was a nice change as well. I just freaking love hushpuppies all around. Very happy with my entree.   Another big plus was the fact that they had Triple C's Smoked Amber on draught. Such an incredible brew and works rather well with BBQ.   The service was great. One girl and a few people in the kitchen were holding down the entire operation.   Next time, I might check out their wings as I've heard they are of note.   Needless to say, I'm stoked about heading back to Sauceman's rather soon.",

I am genuinely confused how it could be so contrary to the numerous good reviews and appetizing photos of the brisket. To make the dryness worse, it was cut WITH the grain, so imagine trying to cut it with weak silverware and watching it simply turn into shredded beef strands instead of succulent bites. The flavor was still somewhat good but had to be heavily masked by their sauce which added most of the moisture.  Hush puppies are sweet and have been the only bright spot in my meals. Collard greens have an interesting kick, but I haven't decided whether that's a good or bad thing. Slaw is extra tangy if you're into that sort of thing.  Food aside, staff has always been friendly. But it largely doesn't matter as smiles and helpful service won't make me come back.",

My only complaint is that they were out of a few items on the menu....I was particularly disappointed that they didn't have any barbecue chicken, but nevertheless the very friendly owner (I believe) suggested the sampler plate which was delicious and satisfying. When I'm in the mood for barbecue, I will definitely consider a drive back to Sauceman's to get some.",

The sauces were great, but I actually thought they would have more of a sauce selection rather than just the typical barb-b-q region flavors.  By this, I mean unusual flavors like jalapeno/honey with cream or something crazy like that - I just made that up, so don't give me a hard time.  The meat itself was nice. The hush-puppies were a little too crispy on the outside and the bathrooms could have been cleaner.  The waitress was great but the host was a little rushed...  I would try it again to see if I had a different opinion.",

I knew I should've made the trek to midwood smokehouse if I really wanted brisket but was so happy with everything the last time I though saucemans might surprise me.  I won't be wasting my time or money on the chance the food MIGHT be good the next time.

    "text": "Conflicted is how I feel about Sauceman's. I went there the other week to grab a quick dinner since I purchased a $12 Groupon. I called in my order right as I was leaving work Uptown and by the time I got there, it was ready. Like that since anyone who has seen the size of my booty knows I like food.   The first thing I noticed when I stepped out of my car was the interesting location---right at the corner of West Blvd and South Tryon Street across from the Bojangles. Good thing I came down Camden since making it into the parking lot from Tryon Street seems like an impossible task. The second thing that hit me was the smell of sweet stuff in the air--was I in the parking lot of a Krispy Kreme?? I soon found out the smell was their sugar biscuits--sugar and biscuits living in harmony together? Say it aint so! But it be so and they were spectacular, more like little dough balls covered in sugar than biscuits though.  I got in, grabbed my pizza and salad to go but got talked into a $1.50 domestic draft that they have on Thursdays (along with $2 glasses of wine), for I just can't pass up a deal like that.  I got the white pizza which has a  garlic/olive oil topping, provolone cheese and fresh sliced tomatoes. It was good but nothing memorable. I was hoping for a little more pizzazz or flavor to come with the pizza but when I got home and took a bite, I was underwhelmed. I added a ton of red pepper flakes and parsley to make it sparkle a little more and once I did, it was fabulous.  Likes: Cheap prices for food and drinks, open seating area with lots of natural light and varied menu with both Italian and BBQ items and a friendly staff.  Dislikes: Unfavorable parking situation and location, lack of flavor of the food  The food was alright and a decent place to try but I don't think I will be saying you need to run right to Sauceman's anytime soon.",

    "text": "One of my recent discoveries in Charlotte is Sauceman's BBQ. When I was growing up in Charlotte the small building at the corner of S. Tryon and West Boulevard was a scary looking Chinese takeout spot - not anyplace I ever thought to stop, although I did frequent the Bojangles across the street! Now with the light rail just a long block away and the burgeoning businesses on Camden Ave. nearby, the owners of Sauceman's have turned this once bleak spot into a highlight of the neighborhood and they serve some tasty BBQ to boot.  I've dined at Sauceman's twice and tried the chopped BBQ, the coarse chopped BBQ, the brisket and the ribs. My favorite is the brisket and the chopped BBQ as well as the mac & cheese, the fried green tomatoes and the hush puppies. The BBQ has a nice smoky flavor and several sauces are available to finish it off. The hush puppies are BIG and tasty. For dessert I indulged in the sugar biscuits - basically fried dough with sugar on top - yum! Next time I want to try the shrimp and grits, which I observed someone else eating last visit. I also saw someone attempting Sauceman's own food challenge: the Clark Griswold - let's just say one person should not be able to eat this giant portion of 2.5 lbs. of chopped pork, hush puppies, bread, slaw and another side dish! If you can eat it in under 30 minutes, it's free - otherwise it's $25. Maybe next time I'll try this with a couple of friends!",

This time the salad came out none of the usual generous size or veggies in the salad.  It had no joke  - 4 pickle slices, 3 grape tomatoes sliced in half, a couple of cucumber slices sliced in half, no corn or cheese, a red onion ring cut into several bits, put the BBQ sauce on the chicken yourself & dry chicken.  It now comes in a much smaller bowl w/Newman salad dressing packets.  I wish some items like the shrimp & grits were avail from the catering menu on the regular menu.  Maybe there was a supply order mistake not sure.  I'm hoping so or sadly my days of completing my bunch cards will be a memory.",

With such lofty expectations, it would have been easy to find something that didn't meet my expectations as far as the food was concerned. But Sauceman's delivered. The ribs were smoked to perfection. The pulled pork was juicy. The brisket was tender and lean. I had to mark this place down one star only because I thought there was an excess of flies on the patio. I understand that flies are to be expected on the patio at a BBQ place, but this was outrageous! A couple of guys near me were forced inside by the flies.   Aside from the flies, though, this is definitely an amazing place for BBQ. Next time I'll just eat inside.",

    "text": "Here's the big question.  Sauceman's or Midwood.  Oh that could prompt an endless debate.  So here's my take:  Sauceman's feels more casual and relaxed.  Almost like eating at a pit stop.  This is where I'd bring a friend who just likes eating BBQ.  Whereas Midwood is the more pretentious, hipster-esque BBQ joint.  This is where I'd bring a friend who I'd like to impress with a cool BBQ spot and share a few local beers.  Sauceman's is BBQ plain and simple.  The red slaw is a perfect digestive to the heaping amount of pulled pork you'd be served.  The hush puppies balances out the BBQ tray by offering you something mealy savor.  Whereas Midwood is BBQ on a creative slant.  Burgers and tacos ... that's beyond the simplified offerings from the pit.  Bacon-wrapped jalapeno is delicious but ... that's just fixin's dolled up.  In a pure side-to-side comparison of solely the pulled pork (ignoring every other meat and side), I'd give the edge to Sauceman's.  Even when absolutely stuffed, I just couldn't put down the fork.  I just kept eating and eating.  Again, the red slaw helps tremendously.  Final Verdict - It's good. Pretty much on par with Midwood so it'll depend on where you are and who you're dining with.

My boyfriend and I took a trip to Charlotte to look for a new place (yay we're moving to the Queen City!) and decided to stop her before a long, rainy day.   And to our pleasant surprise, this establishment was friendly, quick, and gave us great, warm food to make the rainy day that much better! We decided to go with the pulled pork plates, each with either red or white coleslaw, two hushpuppies (they come with the plate already), and different sides. I ended up with the mac n' cheese, and he went with the potato salad. I honestly loved his potato salad more, but the mac n' cheese was delicious as well!   One of the best things that I loved about the place was the walls. They were covered with: 1 - my alma mater - TARHEELS BABY 2 - signatures of everyone that would pay to complain (hilarious, in my opinion)  I definitely recommend this place, however, you must carpool if you plan to bring a crowd, since parking is extremely limited!",

It did not need a sauce but I tried those anyway. I really like their smokey sauce it seems like it is made with just a few ingredients but it is very savory and just a touch of tangy goodness. Prices were reasonable for good BBQ. I got the brisket sandwich, a soda and a side of potato salad. It comes with red or white slaw and some fresh crunchy pickles as well. It was around $12 with everything. My only request that the sandwich have another few slices of brisket. I would of gladly paid $2 or $3 more for a larger portion. The slaw was good crunchy with a good vinegar tang. The potato salad was flavorful with a mustard base and some little bits of crunchy goodness. I will make this one of my regular stops when I visit South End. Delicious.",

It's Charlotte, parking is bad everywhere.LOL. It's on the corner at the red light so be prepared or you will go by it. They had a fire going outside but it was raining or we would have sat there.

I ordered the brisket plate w/ white slaw which was served on 2 slices of Texas toast plus a side of mac & cheese. I also tried some of the the chopped pork since my friend and I shared our main meats. The food was pretty darn good and the price was even better! My entire platter was only about $11 plus a few extra dollars for the mac & cheese, but well worth the value. The service was fantastic - everyone who works there is super friendly and actually seems like they want to be there which makes the whole experience even better.  The only thing that kinda sucked was that we were too early to order from their grill section (after 2pm on Fridays and all day Saturday), but hopefully I'll be back down in Charlotte soon and will try to go when I can order from this part of the menu!",

Some highlights and \"low\"-lights for y'all:  Highlights:  One word to describe the dry rub wings: OTHERWORLDLY.  The sauced-up wings were good, but almost too intense--good thing there's beer on hand to subdue it a bit.  DEF get the wings when you go.  The BBQ (pulled pork) was so good you didn't really need any sauces.  Savory and the right amount of smoky taste.    Lowlights: Ribs were mediocre and inconsistent.  Came here a few days before and the ribs were cooked to where it was fall-off-the-bone.  This time around, the ribs were a bit on the dry side and stuck to the ribs.  I'm no BBQ expert, but as I understand it, there should be a little bit of pull from the bone.  Both times, the ribs missed the mark.  That said, I'll definitely go back at some point.

    "text": "Had their food at a BBQ competition and it was great, so I was dying to take my boyfriend there. Finally took him there tonight- big mistake.  First, I ordered a miller lite- they were out. A Sierra Nevada. Out.  Got a Mecktoberfest. My boyfriend ordered a half rack & fried pickles, I ordered a brisket sandwich with fried green tomatoes. We were pumped.  I noticed one table sent his food back because it was cold. At another table, one person got their entree 7 minutes after their table mate. I thought, so the service is slow and surely- a joint in Memphis is KNOWN for that. I dismissed the lack of beer as a poorly timed shipment. I was wrong.  The ribs looked gleaming and awesome. The sauce was great. The ribs were meaty, but cold. Not cool, not room temperature. Like just taken out of the fridge cold. The brisket appeared to have been sliced by a kindergartener. The meat was so fatty- none of the fat had been trimmed prior to cooking and the smoking process had not rendered the fat out. The green tomatoes were sliced so thickly that despite being deep fried, they were totally raw. Brought the meat home for the dogs- on the up side, the dogs seemed to really like it.   They gave us a voucher for a free meal, but we will just give it away. Also- saw at the BBQ comp that their sweet biscuits are Pillsbury biscuits (like the kind from the tube) torn up and deep fried.   Myron Mixon and Tuffy Stone would not be impressed.",

I was happy when I saw Sauceman's. You know, that place you always mean to go to. Here it was coming to me!  Dove into the brisket sandwich and some dope (and I don't use the word dope lightly) mac and cheese. They had a choice of three sauces. The one numbed spicy (it was not) I doused my brisket and cheesy mac with. What a satisfying meal. The type of meal where your boyfriend stares you down because he finished eating before you and wants some of your food but instead of asking stares at you with starving wolf eyes until you offer your last two bites for the take of relationship harmony. Ladies, you know the look.  Time to make time to try the banana pudding.",

I ordered Mac & Cheese....which was a weird pink color....not worth it. The Hush-puppies and Regular coleslaw were pretty good. Bottom Line \"I'll be back for more\"",

    "text": "I have tried BBQ pork from all over the Southeast and this is BY FAR the best I've ever had! Today was my first visit (unfortunately), so I ordered a \"Sauceman's Original\". WOW! The Texas Toast used for the sandwich buns had an excellent taste and texture (not too crispy, not too soft). The melted cheddar was an excellent touch. I didn't get the onions and tomatoes due to my preferences. To ensure the taste of the pork was really that amazing, I took some out of the sandwich to eat by itself. The taste was just as great! The BBQ sauce provided had a great taste. It was sweet enough and complimented the overall taste without being overwhelming or masking the food's taste. The fries were crinkle cut and covered in a nice seasoned salt that added to the overall taste of the food.   As a huge fan of good BBQ, I seek out great restaurants frequently. Based on my experience, Sauceman's has the best BBQ in the Southeast and has won my business! I would highly recommend to anyone!",

They don't have a wide array of options, which is good since they stick to what they know best.  I ordered the pork plate with red slaw.  I'm a barbecue fan, and even though it wasn't the best I've tasted (Austin, TX bbq still ranks as my favorite), it was pretty darn good.  The sauces were plentiful enough as they have the typical choices for a mustard based and vinegar based sauce along with the traditional.  The place is small but they do have outdoor seating.  I would recommend to add this to the list to take visitors to for some good southern BBQ.  My brother-in-law ordered the half rack of ribs which were actually quite a large portion for lunch and he said this place was the best he's tasted in Charlotte so far.  Another highlight was the mac n' cheese side which will now be my favorite there.   We also ordered the fried doughnuts, which were just ok.  I've had better at asian buffets.",

    "text": "Wow.  Came here for lunch and I'm really blown away.  Got the brisket plate with Mac and cheese and red slaw.  Being from the north east, red slaw was a new experience, but given my dislike for regular coleslaw, which is gross, I was pleasantly surprised.  The regular BBQ sauce is a bit sweet for my taste, but the golden sauce, made with mustard, is perfect, and I wish I'd gotten extra.  The brisket was a nice cut, with an appropriate split of fat to meat.  The mac and cheese had lots of pepper, which I loved, it really helped to cut through the creamy richness of the cheese.  On the whole, it seems like Saucemans has mastered the art of balance, something that particular challenging in BBQ.  They balance the fatty grease of the brisket with the red slaw, the creaminess of the mac with pepper, the sweet of the BBQ sauce with the tangy bite of mustard.  The only item That left me disappointed was the \"sugar biscuits.\"  I was expect small sugary biscuits, I got donut holes or beignets (I'm unsure of the difference and google wasn't very enlightening).  Definitely one of the top 10 barbecue joints in the US that I've been to (better exist in Austin, San Antonio and Boston), and the next time I'm in Charlotte, I'll be stopping by and dining in.    PS.  Free chicharonnes while you wait, 'nuff said.",

    "text": "After reading the low rated reviews (2&3 stars), I decided to still give this restaurant a try because the movers that assisted with my move to Charlotte recommended this place as the best in Charlotte of all eateries. Unfortunately they were all legitimate concerns. I spent $50+ on a pittman's combo, half dozen wings, and banana pudding for my lady and myself. The portions of meat were moderate, but the sides were very very small. The side of corn was basically one fresh ear cut into 2. The Mac' n Cheese was a small cup which was the size of a single scoop. I ordered banana pudding and it was twice the quantity of the Mac n cheese. Again, this combo is recommended aa a shareable for 2. The flavor of the BBQ meat was 3/5. Definitely nothing to phone home about. The sauce was ok but nothing special either. The corn tasted good but again the quantity for a $40 combo was insufficient.  All in all, this place seems like a post-gentrification mom and pop which previously probably was the talk of town but has since been turned into a gentrification meet-up. Sorry Sauceman's, I wanted this to be such a great foodie experience but you undoubtedly missed the mark. :(",

The mac and cheese was okay, it wasn't box mac and cheese but probably wouldn't get it again. Sauces for the BBQ had a good variety, not a big fan of the added smoke in bbq sauces.

We received a $200 Foodie Call gift card at our baby shower and decided to start ordering from places that we have been meaning to try but haven't quite made it to yet.  Sauceman's was on that list.  First, the food.  We ordered the the Dixie's Cuban and the Sauceman's Original, both with pork.  We found neither sandwich anything to write home about but to be fair, I think we both found that we prefer a sandwich with just good BBQ and maybe coleslaw.  Not the best BBQ I've had but not the worst.  (My Dixie Cuban only had one friend pickle on it.  ONE.)  Our sides were mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes.  The mac and cheese has a weird after taste, not a fan but the fried green tomatoes were yummy.  Salty, but I prefer them that way.  The meals were also supposed to come with slaw and we selected the white and the red however this was left out of our order.  We also ordered hushpuppies and fried pickles, both pretty good.  (ok, we went overboard with the fried stuff this order, buy hey, i had been eating healthy for the previous 9 months and needed to splurge.)  Then the service.  I called to just let them know that we did not receive any coleslaw and about the stinginess of the pickles on the sandwich.  I wasn't going to be sending the Foodie Call driver back over some cole slaw, after all, we had ordered PLENTY of food, it was just strictly principal.  The manager says, \"I double checked this order myself and there was coleslaw and there were pickles on the sandwich.\"  Seriously? I guess my foodie call driver snacked on our food before he delivered it.    All in all, Sauceman's left a bad taste in my mouth.  Food and service, or lack thereof.",

    "text": "Honestly, very disappointing.   I came in expecting comparable food to Midwood Smokehouse and Mac's, both of which I love, and I was sorely disappointed.  Food: The BBQ was dry to the point that it didn't really taste good. The sauces were hit or miss but slightly less palatable than the Mac's / Midwood selections. The sides were awful, the fried green tomato and the mac and cheese were incredibly bland. Honestly I might as well have been eating celery! Absolutely no taste. The saving grace of the food (the reason for the 2 stars) was that the red slaw was very tasty, and this is coming from someone that usually hates slaw all together. The beer selection was also pretty good considering their small size.   Ambiance: The service wasn't 'slow' or 'bad' but the place was a bit of a wreck. They only had one person running the register, bussing tables and running food. Obviously this lead to no tables being available because they were filthy and hadn't been cleared! Not cool to severely understaff your restaurant. We had to clear our own table that was covered in sauces, food etc. from the previous patrons.  Go to Mac's or Midwood Smokehouse instead. IMO. We definitely will not be back.",

I ordered plates that was full of Cole slaw, Mac and cheese (baked) and juicy brisket and some toast but now I get a plate with pre portioned slaw and Mac and cheese I have gotten better from publix grocery store two thin strips of brisket and some golf ball like hush puppies and oh yes a 2oz portion of bbq sauces like really and it was 18 dollars omg. I will never visit this place again. Just because you won an award doesn't mean you lose the love in the art of cooking good food. I hope this places looks for its roots and plant them again...",

    "text": "Very impressed! The staff was kind and helpful. One of the cashiers was annoying as she kept nit picking arguments with other staff.    The food was awesome 1/2 rack of rib (the meat was slightly dry), sweet sauce was excellent!, red slaw was unexpectedly wonderful and the Mac and cheese was creamy, perfectly portioned as a side and a great compliment to the lunch.  The sweet tea was balanced wonderfully and fresh.  Side note: GET the sweet biscuits they are a great experience, I did not expect them to be like donuts but was happy about their unusual texture and presentation.  I will be back!",

    "text": "Went for lunch with a co-worker yesterday.  Got there around 12:30 knowing it was a small place, and hoping that some of the inside tables would turn and we could sit inside.  I love it when a plan comes together (RIP George Peppard)  I parked in the grass in an outside parking lot and passed by the big a** smoker on the trailer on the way in and watched the guy with the chainsaw cutting the wood to feed the fire right next to it.  Now that, my friends is how I imagine heaven.  Nice decor, they allowed patrons to write all over the wall which was enjoyable to read the BBQ centered graffiti.  I got the 3 meat sampler which included Smoked Turkey, Beef Brisket, and chopped pork.    1st the chopped pork was awesome.  Whomever is responsible for that smokehouse knows how to smoke pork.  It was moist, flavorful and had a great wood smoke flavor.  It didn't even need sauce.  Beef Brisket was completely dry and not worth even trying, I left it alone.  Smoked turkey looked dry but surprisingly it wasn't.  Again, nice smoke flavor and when complimented with the sauce of which there are many selections was good.  Next time I'd stick with the pork.  I have a steadfast rule that if a place serves Mac & Cheese I must try it.  I didn't care that much for Sauceman's the mac was fine, the cheese was gritty and not smooth the way mac and cheese should be.    All in all, good cue.  The experience with watching the guy and the smoker was enough to get me to return, I love that stuff!!!",

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a really dry chewy bun. It possibly could have been a sandwich set aside from other chicken sandwiches but i guess they were too busy to put the \"special sauce\" on even though there were no other customers. They get two starts because the food was hot",

    "text": "I've read the other reviews and I am surprised with the generosity of the ratings. I live near Sauceman's and was really rooting for this place. I drive by the restaurant often and never see many cars in the parking lot, but I didn't let that deter me. I visited on a Saturday night with my sister. There were about eight adults and one child having dinner. We were a little confused on whether to seat ourselves or wait at the counter. A server explained that we ordered at the register then we could sit wherever. We were handed paper menus and began to peruse. An employee working the register was very friendly and explained the menu to us. He doted heavily on the ribs and chicken so I decided to go with his recommendation. I also ordered the meatball pasta which stated the meatballs were homemade. I intentionally ordered two entrees so I could get a real feel for the restaurant. My food came very quickly and it was plenty. The best thing on my plate were the sugar biscuits everything else was extremely average tasting. Here are my thought on each item: Rib & Chicken Platter: Ribs: tough and undercooked , had to literally yank apart; bbq sauce was bland Chicken: not very flavorful Baked beans: yuck is all I can say Onion rings: average Sugar biscuits: yummy but didn't seem to go with the rest of the platter; should offer this as a dessert item instead of being apart of the platter Garlic bread: good but seemed out of place on a rib and chicken and platter Meatball Pasta (this was a baked dish): Cheese was like plastic, very hard to pull apart; better off eating stouffers frozen lasagna Sauce: bland Pasta: consisted of penne pasta and spiral pasta, wasn't sure if they ran out of one and added the second type to finish the dish Bread sticks: Greasy, flavorless; should have offered the garlic bread with this dish instead of with the rib platter  My sister had the chicken platter with potato salad and fries. The potato salad wasn't bad but it was good either. It was missing something but I'm not sure what. Her fries were good and they gave her plenty.  Overall, I will not be going back to Sauceman's. The service was good but the food was not. Another thing my sister and I noticed but I won't go into great detail about was the configuration. The design and layout did not flow. The owners should have hired a restaurant consultant because the layout made no sense at all. God forbid they get very busy, with this layout there will indeed be food flying, and not into mouths.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed Sauceman's.  I've visited 3 times and enjoyed myself each time.  It's not spectactular, but it has great potential to be a neighborhood favorite.  The ribs are very respectable.  The two times I've tried them, they were nearly fall off the bone style, though my friend's ribs  seemed a little less so.  The sauce had good flavor, but I definitely felt like a little more was needed.  The steak sandwich is pretty tender for a thin cut, but I would definitely NOT order it more than medium.  The relish only on it gives it a pretty unique flavor that's simple, but pleasant.  The onion rings and fries are better than average.  Both come freshly fried and stayed crispy even 15 minutes later - but not like Burger King fake crispy.  My favorite so far has to be the Reuben.  It's very light for a Ruben, but with great flavor.  I ate mine cold since a friend delivered it to me, but I can't wait to try it hot!  The sugar biscuits are fantastic.  As another reviewer wrote, I could eat a dozen easily!  Another huge plus is local beer on tap. Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is on tap and is the freshest beer you'll get in Charlotte!  Overall very good food and will try it again~!",
