It's a decent breakfast spot if that's what you're craving. I just don't see why it's a die hard spot to eat at.",

I love their chocolate chip pancakes, and their coffee is way better than your typical breakfast diner cup'o'jo. The waitress was accommodating and tentative. Just know that when you get their \"hash browns\" it's not the shredded potato strings that you would expect when ordering your usual hash browns. They are more like peasant potato wedges. Still good, just not what you would expect. Also the wait on Saturday and Sunday mornings ranges from 15 to 45 min and you cannot call ahead and make reservations. But you can put your name in and go walk around to the other nearby shops. They give you a text notification when they are ready to seat your party.",

Specially Teresa, who doesn't even say hi and enjoys dropping hints about leaving, like coming by and asking if we want coffees to go, even after being there just a short time. It's ridiculous and ruins the experience.",

Our favorites include the veggie omelette, apple crepe, waffles and the ultimate favorite - the Dutch Baby. If you plan on getting this, be sure to let your server know when you sit down so they can go ahead and start making it. It's at least a 25 min wait, and if you have waited the typical long wait for this place...another 25 min can be painful. This place is every bit worth the wait, and they can text you when your table is available making it easier to kill time.",

The Original Pancake House is a chain, but completely unlike others- one that I actually enjoy.  When you come in, you are greeted nicely and sat quickly. We came on Easter Sunday and were sat right away (pretty impressive for the Bible Belt). Coffee was served right away (good luck getting that at IHOP) and our food came out only a short while after we ordered.  The taste was good, the prices were fair, and the service was excellent. I will return. Did I mention that I dislike IHOP? :)",

The server was busy and our glasses frequently went dry.  The server did make some nice substitutions such as the fruit cup with no grapes or cantaloupe for a young child.  He also brought out alternate syrups upon request.  This place is very busy from the church crowd on weekends and parking is scarce.

    "text": "I visited this place in between deliveries to have a quick bite to eat.  Luckily I didn't have an order for quite some time because if I had I'd be in trouble.  When I arrived I was immediately greeted by the hostess and seated in a booth next to another party.  My first impression of the restaurant was overall warm and the place seems well-maintained with a decent health sanitation score.  They have a few random things on the wall for decoration but it's no biggie because you are here to eat right?  I will say that the food came out slowly but surely.  It was hot and fresh but they don't use any salt (which is good for a lot of people).  The atmosphere is good and service was okay but there was very few people there at the time I went.  I ordered  two eggs over medium, turkey bacon and substituted my pancakes for grits.  I didn't take time to really think much past taking a photo and I smashed the whole meal.  The pricing is a bit higher than what I would like and the whole experience just reminds me of an IHOP knockoff.  Maybe they came first but I really don't know.  What I do know is if you are looking to have a quick bite this would be a great place to try.  I mean what have you really got to lose?  For the area that you are in I would say this is a really good spot.  Of course you can grab something a bit more immaculate since this is located in Southpark Charlotte and there's a McDonalds right next door that does all day breakfast although those folded eggs aren't really my thing.  I can't really comment on this places Pancakes because I have never had them.  Another visit is due at a higher traffic time when it's packed to see what things are like then.  Until next time..",

My 14 yo son typically gets some type of pancakes (he likes their chocolate chip) and my husband always gets an omelet and we split it because they are enormous!!!  During our recent visit, we had the Chorizo Omelet and it was quite good...Chorizo, peppers, onions, cheese with a side of salsa (they have green and black olives in their salsa, which is a bit odd but tastes ok) and sour cream.  Their (enormous) omelets also come with a side of pancakes, but we opt for home fries instead.  Their coffee is ok...it's a bit on the strong side for me, but it's acceptable.    Service is always friendly and attentive.  The only major downside is that there is always a long wait on the weekends....so get there early!!  Our last visit was the morning after a night of freezing rain so the restaurant was only busy and not CRAZY busy so we walked right in...and got the last open table.  Score!  Prices a bit high for breakfast ($11.95 for the Chorizo omelet with side of potatoes), but consistent with other breakfast places in the South Park area.",

As I waited in the waiting area for my table, the gentleman came out to announce my table was ready and let the door close in my face . Then I ordered a bacon and cheese omelette. The bacon was literally black, and the omelette all shades of brown with burnt crust at the end. It was in the shape of a pancake. I thought this was some new retro gluten free crap they served me by mistake. Nope it was the omelette . My question is why would a server serve something she would not approve of. She is suppose to be like the coffee filter making sure the grinds don't get in the pot. Let's not talk about coffee because that's another horrid story. They should just put a sign on the cup that says \"Go to Starbucks.\" They do have cute cups and the keep your glasses full. (Hence the 2 stars)",

He was patient with us while we decided what we wanted to eat and brought our beverages. Then we ordered and he asked us up front if we wanted our checks to be separate which I appreciated. The food came out in a timely fashion. We ordered Corned beef hash and scrambled eggs, strawberry pancakes, an apple Belgian waffle, a Mediterranean omelet, a vegetarian omelet, a side of hash browns and grits. The Mediterranean omelet was great. It had chicken, black olives, feta cheese, and spinach. The omelet was flavorful and none of the items overpowered the others. The vegetarian omelet had spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. It was awesome. The omelets were large enough to feed 2 people. It was light and fluffy. Both omelets came with a side of buttermilk pancakes that melted in your mouth. The syrup was not too sweet but left a smooth but subtle aftertaste. The strawberry pancakes were the same but the homemade whipped cream was a bonus. The strawberry syrup was sweet and subtle and contributed to the fresh strawberries. The hash browns were more like diced potatoes and were not hard but not soft. They were pan seared and had a little crunch too them. The Apple Belgian waffle with apple syrup had diced apple pieces that were marinated with cinnamon and brown sugar. It came with apple syrup which complemented the waffle and it was not too sweet. The Corned beef hash had a crispy outside but the inside was flavorful and moist. The hash and potatoes ratio was perfect and the potatoes were cooked all the way through. At the end, Marc brought us to go containers and to go beverages. He made sure that we had everything we needed. He is a great server and I will definitely be back!",

After reading the reviews on what is good here, I decided to get an omelet and upgrade my pancakes. The people in my group ordered bacon and eggs.  Our server was really nice and answered all our questions and was patient with us while we decide what we wanted.  After placing our order, the food came out fairly quick I feel. My omlet looked kinda of weird at first but when I took a bite into it, I knew it will taste great. After i pretty much inhale my omlet, I then worked on my pancakes.  I went with the Pumpkin Pecan pancakes and the pumpkin flavor was really good. You know how when they flavor pancakes, the flavor is weak, NOT with these, These were very very good. I told my self, I would only eat two, but I ended up eating all three!  My buddies got the chocolate chip pancakes and he ate all three of his! He said they were really good.  All in all, don't let the long line outside scare you, it goes quick, and food comes out quick also. You would be in and out of there in no time! I will most definitely come back when I'm in Charlotte again.",

The steak was less than desirable but I was hungry and too tired of asking the waitress for help.  I wouldn't recommend this place - way too much work to get a meal right...

We started with the fresh squeezed orange juice! It was very fresh and and a large is in a huge glass! A small is all you may need. My companion ordered the Bacon and Egg platter that comes with 3 pancakes. He said that it was all cooked well and the bacon was thick cut and cooked to just the right crispness. I ordered the Chorizo omelet with banana pancakes. The omelet was HUGE! Apparently they make their omelets with 5 eggs! You definitely could share! I took over half of it with me. The omelet was very fresh, just the right amount of spicy, and came with a warm salsa and sour cream. I barely made a dent in it! Then I had 4 smaller banana pancakes with a dusting of powdered sugar. I only need a very small amount of syrup, as the pancakes were sweet from the bananas. I like a little more banana in my pancakes, but overall they were still great. We really enjoyed our meal and would definitely go back...but share next time!",

Partly it's that I love the Tahitian Maiden's Dream crepe, which should be an ungodly sweet mess, but somehow is very satisfying nonetheless.  Except on mid-morning weekends, we are always seated promptly. There can be a long-ish wait on weekends, but they do manage the crowds pretty well.   Has lots of options for breakfast: from traditional eggs and such to less common pancake and crepe options. Everything is solid and a bit on the expensive side compared to say, a Waffle House. However it is much cleaner than a Waffle House too, so it may be worth the price differential.  Service has varied pretty widely. We have had super-helpful and friendly waitstaff as well as cranky, indifferent wait staff. They all seem pretty clued-in to serving tables with children, however, which is a big plus.

Pancakes were good, better than ihop, even after we watched kitchen microwave them before bringing to table. Final verdict?

I switch between the original pancakes and their banana walnut pancakes. The menu offers such a wide selection of options, it may be hard to make up your mind at first. No matter what you choose, I'm sure you'll be pleased.  There is usually a long wait on the weekends, but it is worth it. Please don't let it discourage you. They offer courtesy coffee while you wait, which is an added plus.",

    "text": "It was my genius idea to eat a late breakfast here before heading across the street to get all wine-up at the Great Grapes Festival.  Of course I didn't think of the fact that at 10ish it's packed with people who just finished the cancer walk (the confusing part is this is not the closest one to uptown...).  I was pretty impressed with the quick turnover of the tables.  The menu is big (literally and figuratively).  They don't offer the typical breakfast combo of eggs, meat, toast/biscuit, hushbrown/grits. But you bet it that pancakes come with almost everything. I ended up with the corned beef hash breakfast, which come with 2 eggs and pancakes.  I love mixing my corned beef hash with grits, so I had to order a side of grits (boooo!).  My sweet tooth of a boyfriend ordered an oven baked apple pancake with chocolate chips added.  It's way more exciting to write about his food... that thing is huge and thick, and it doesn't look like a pancake at all.  More like bread pudding or something.  It's not too sweet, but sweet enough that you don't have to put syrup if you don't want to.  He managed to finish it (with a little help from me).  I swear I don't know how he stays so freaking tiny.  My breakfast on the other hand was ok.  The corned beef hash was not as salty as others.  The pancakes weren't as good as I would have expected from a place named \"Original Pancake House.\"  It's a little mushy if I have to say.  I do have to say I wasn't happy with the service at first.  The lady wasn't exactly friendly.  I was without silverwares for longer that I should.  I know this place was crowded, but it's always crowded, so that's not good enough of a reason. But oh well... I was told to chill, so chill I did haha  Apparently I'll be back for their seasonal pumpkin pancakes... let's guess whose idea that is??",

Our waiter, Ana, was unprepared, rude and had to have the last word. When she first came to our table we asked to order and she was obviously thrown off by this. She went to get her notepad, then came back. She then asked for our orders confusing herself as she went. Finally, she went to put in the order. When it arrived she had messed up my order, giving me six pancakes instead of three. I told her that I ordered three and not six pancakes and she claimed that I had ordered six. She then took my plate, went to the back, took off three pancakes and brought my plate back. She also messed up my little sister's order. She omitted my sister's piece of bacon, which was included in the Junior plate that she ordered. After, she simply brought out the check and left. No 'have a nice day' or anything. Very poor service but satisfactory food.",

I went here this past Saturday - the wait wasn't long at all and the host taking names was awesome.  Very nice.    We were looking forward to brunch as I had my bestie visiting from out of town.  We both ordered the Dutch Baby and split an order of potato pancakes and corned beef hash.  The Dutch Baby was just the wrong item for me to order.  I googled it and it was billed as a 'puffed pancake' when really it's more like a thick crepe.  I hate crepe's.  I'm not a fan of eggs frankly.  And this dish was just too eggy.  My bff enjoyed hers.  The potato pancake was also too eggy and not enough potato, though it was pleasantly seasoned.  The corned beef hash was good, but by that time I was just so let down by my poor choices that I didn't eat too much.  The service was great and I will definitely be back - it's funny everyone and their brother seems to know that a Dutch Baby is eggy.  LOL.  I commented to the waiter about it and he said \"yeah that's why i've never tried it, I don't like eggs.\"  So moral of the story - ask the right questions prior to ordering.  LOL.",

After we were seated, no one waited on us. For 10 minutes. They waited on everyone else. A huge disappointment.  @Karen T- I'd rather not share my email. It was a lesson learned for me.

Extremely generous portions. I'd estimate the omelette to be 10 inches in diameter if I recall correctly. Perfect amount and balance of fillings fill the omelette. The best part is how insanely fluffy the omelette is. It really cant get better than this. Best omelette I've had.   I've also had the Eggs Michael. If you're a die-hard Eggs benedict fan, you'll love this creative twist on the classic dish. It's seriously awesome. Mushroom sherry sauce doesn't sound like it'd be good with eggs benedict but it's freaking delicious. Get it. You won't regret it. Also, the potato pancakes that come with this dish are the bees-knees. crispy out the outside yet still has that potatoey stringy hashbrown texture you know and love.   And of course, if you are craving normal eggs benedict, this place does them pretty well too. They do everything right. Perfectly crisp english muffin, perfectly poached egg, perfectly seasoned hollandaise. Not too sweet, not too sour.   One caveat though, ironically, the pancakes here at the Original Pancake House are just okay. I like mine fluffy and moist. These lean a little drier than I prefer.  We always go around 2 or 3 in the afternoon so we never ever run into crowds if you don't feel like waiting. I heard it can get crazy crowded during lunch/breakfast hours.",

Surprisingly, if we don't sit in that section this doesn't happen. It's like they forget there's a whole section of the restaurant they need to work. So if you'd like a good meal here make sure you ask for the main section!",

    "text": "Original Pancake House is always packed on Sundays so it was nice to see only an 18-25 minute wait time online. I was able to put my name in online and have 10 minutes to check in at the door. Once I checked it I only waited 10 minutes, nice! Once seated, service wasn't great! My waiter has a few tables and we all seemed to be looking for him. I ordered the Hash Browns and Eggs, which comes with 3 original pancakes and I added a side of Bacon. My order was delivered with no pancakes. I asked about the pancakes and he looked at me strangely. Needless to say three pancakes were delivered cold.  They must have been sitting out for a while.  My coffee and water went unfilled, and when I asked for some more sugar packets I never received them. As for the food, it was good, although I do wish my pancakes were fresh/hot! I have been to the Metropolitan location and will stick to that one, seems the service and food are better there.",

    "text": "Down in a hold behind the McDonald's on Fairview Ave across from South Park Mall is one of the Original Pancake restaurants.  Hard to find, but an excellent place for breakfasts and lunches.  My 98 year old dad really loves pancakes so this is his place when we have medical appointments at Novant Senior Care next door.    The host and servers are always courteous and friendly.  With my dad, once they see the walker the host will acknowledge the walker to others waiting and put dad into a seat right away.  We are more than willing to wait our turn, but that courtesy is much appreciated.  Apparently this is a standard they regularly maintain for your floor staff and my guess is that they look to hire people with this courtesy attitude.   We get fast and efficient service and one unique item is the apple or cherry crepe.  Dad can wolf down, well...maybe not wolf, but can consume almost all of this three crepe order by himself.  It is that good.  He also likes pancakes with a fried egg, which he puts in between two pancakes.  They really do have good meals here and the prices are very reasonable.  Parking is in the strip mall lot, so you might have to park and walk a bit to get to the restaurant.",

That was 3 years ago -wheat germ pancakes and homemade corned beef hash- and it threw me into an existential crisis, forcing me to question everything I though I knew about a great pancake. Add to that, I'd never had corned beef hash made from scratch until that point. I was never the same.  OPH is a breakfast gamechanger.  One of my favorite things about OPH is that you can order more or less than the standard portion. I awoke wanting crepes AND pancakes for breakfast. Easy fix. Ordered 2 crepes, and 3 pancakes. *Slaying the red 'easy' button.*  Today was the first time I ordered crepes there, and had I known they make them so huge, would have just ordered one. They were more eggy than I would have liked, but the pecan pancakes were exceptional. Outstanding service by Rosalyn today. Lastly, I love maple syrup, so much so I could drink it. OPH is the rare restaurant that serves it in it's purest form.   You down with OPH?! Yeah, you know me :) .",

My usual haunts are Stack's & Charlotte Cafe where 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns & java are priced in the $6-7 range. Being a firm believer in value I can honestly say that all three deliver. OPH bacon is thick cut, well smoked & ample, 4 slices versus 3. Their coffee is a far superior blend as is their buttermilk pancake blend. Service is A+ at all three. Occasionally, having spent 23+ years in the coffee trade, I'll order a French Press at OPH and really bump my day over the top.",

Every server walked right past us never acknowledged that they had a new customer in the empty restaurant. After waiting for no one to come over we got up and decided to leave. As we were walking out some guy shouted at us oh y'all are leaving? We said yes why would I spend my money at a restaurant who treats their customers like this.

The Hollandaise sauce is the best I've had ever - anywhere!  And the potato pancakes that come with them are to die for!!  I don't know how they do it, they are thin, crisp, potatoey and very onioney.  I love them!!  It only makes me sad that I live in Durham and only get to this place about once a year.  I did switch once and try the Dutch Baby, which was big and lovely and tasty with all the powdered sugar, butter and lemony, but I really missed my eggs bennie and potato pancakes and have never looked back.  Oh, you must try it and btw, get the sour cream and applesauce for the tater pancakes.",

Maybe the potato was undercooked because it was hard and had a weird flavor. Coffee was good and service was fine. And the best part was that there was no wait.",

Their pancakes are good, but I prefer IHOP or Bob Evans. And for the love of god, do NOT get the potato pancakes. I was so excited they had these because I make them annually for Christmas, but they were awful.

They accommodate larger groups in the small space, pricing is fantastic (especially for being in South Park), DELICIOUS food, friendly staff, the wait is never unbearable, and frankly, I just love it. For a brief period of time, I wanted to become a franchisee of an OPH and bring it to Fort Mill. I couldn't imagine any possible reason why it wouldn't be successful. I've been to one in Savannah, too. Equally as busy and delicious. When I visit, I visit on Sundays. So, always prime time, busy and fresh. I've still never gotten the wrong order, had to send something back for being undercooked, had a hair in my food...NONE of the common complaints when a restaurant it slammed.  Frankly, if I could sleep in a bed of chocolate chip pancakes and whipped cream (fresh, hand whipped), I might never get up. If you didn't figure out that chocolate chip pancakes are my favorite from that sentence, I'm equally as concerned for you as you now are for me. The hash browns are NOT the fried strips of preprocessed potato flakes. You're going to get real potatoes chopped into chunks, seasoned and sauteed with onion; a masterpiece. I've been here several times and will use anyone visiting or who hasn't been, as an excuse to go. With a HUGE menu, genuine staff and amazing food, you MUST stop here. They have locations everywhere, too. I've found that each location has a a few slightly different options too. Like, Savannah had Reese's Cup pancakes.  Not sure I'll ever get a picture for this review though. Once my food hits the table, it gets in my belly, do not pass go, do not collect $200, ain't no time for that! I'll see what I can do but likely, you'll all have to enjoy an image of me chowing down like a linebacker!",

    "text": "For under $8 (in South Park, that's nothing), I was served two eggs, two potato pancakes, three pancakes and three turkey sausage links.  I went for lunch on election day 2010 and though the place was packed, our party of two was seated immediately.  The eggs were decent; nothing special.  The potato pancakes were pretty good, but not the best I've had.  The turkey sausage and pancakes, on the other hand, were the best I've had in Charlotte.  In my experience, turkey sausage is just something that restaurants keep on hand to please their selective customers (again, this is South Park we're talking about), but I actually feel like the Original Pancake House cared about the quality of even their more obscure ingredients.  As for the pancakes, they were simply the best I've had, which says a lot considering I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general.  This filling lunch was well worth my $8.  The best breakfast restaurant I've been to around the Quail Commons area where I work.",

    "text": "One of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte is definitely The Original Pancake House on Sharon Road, that is if you can get in the door. On any given Sunday the restaurant is packed with people and the wait is over an hour, but it is totally worth the wait. I have never had a bad experience at The Original Pancake House and I've tried many different dishes over the years.   Perhaps my favorite dish at The Original Pancake House is their chocolate chip pancakes. Now I love a good chocolate chip pancake and it's very hard to get them done just right. Most of the places I've been to may put a few chips inside the pancake, but the majority of the chips are scattered on top of the pancakes. However, at The Original Pancake House they put tons of chocolate chips both inside the pancakes and on top of the whipped cream that's on the pancakes. This makes for a great combination of perfectly melted chocolate chips and hard chocolate chips on top that melt in your mouth.  Also another favorite of mine is the ham and cheese omelet. The omelet's at The Original Pancake House are absolutely huge and I don't think I've ever actually finished a whole omelet in one sitting. Not only are these omelets big, but they are also stuffed with whatever toppings you want, so you will not be disappointed with your meal.   The only reason I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because of the wait time and the noise level inside the restaurant (sometimes it gets pretty loud), but if I were basing my rating solely on the quality of the food then I would give The Original Pancake House a 5-star rating. The food tastes fantastic and it is very reasonable for the price. You definitely should check it out the next time you are looking for a great brunch spot and have some time to kill.",

I order my eggs over easy and they don't always come out that way at other places... props to the kitchen for making me some perfectly cooked eggs! Very filling meal, however, the service was pretty lacking. Had to ask the server twice for straws, and once we ordered, she brought our food and we didn't see her again.

Want pancakes? 42 different means of eating it. I haven't seen a Dutch Baby on a menu in ages! It's what would happen if your souffle fell on hard times into a pancake and was working it's way towards turning tricks as a bread pudding. Dense, moist *pan cake* with a fried dough-ish edge. It'll feed a family of four and here it's under $8. I can't have much sugar and was given a cute little pitcher of hot sugar free chemical juice o drizzle on it - perfect. All syrups should be served warm and they are here, bonus! My son had the crepe Florentine (yes, he's weird) and a hot chocolate and both were delicious. My husband's corned beef was an interesting mix of fresh corn beef with a spicy kick and firm potatoes - a winner. The pancakes that accompany practically everything but a pancake order are think and fluffy and perfect. Best I've had outside of Dottie's in SF. We were originally sent there for the coffee and their unique habit of giving you actual heavy cream with it. We didn't order coffee. Idiots, I know.  The staff is unique: a preppy college kid with Death Metal tattoo he surely regrets on his bicep, a large African American man that is confrontational more than welcoming but in a good \"I know everything and there's nothing I can't handle\" way who actually breaks into a smile that changes his whole demeanor.  The total was a bit over $30 for the 3 of us and we each had probably half our meal left over.  It was crowded, loud and definitely worth a visit.",

The baked pancake my friend got looked beautiful and he finished the whole thing - it was as big as a 12-inch plate and two inches thick.  OMG.  So for those pancake lovers out there - this is your place!!!    Well for my meal I had the corned-beef sandwich and it was fantastic (except I know for next time to order it without the weird thick cheese).  And I had a side of corned-beef hash.  I never knew this was what it was supposed to taste like.  My mom gave us corned-beef hash out of a can.  I knew nothing about the real thing until this blessed day.  Sigh.....I could make a meal out of it.  Salty and crisped on the grill to perfection.  I was in heaven.  Absolutely a perfect meal.    Service was super fast and friendly.

Our server, Rodney, was quick to check on our table and get our coffee and order - great server very tentative, and coffee cup was never empty.  I had Eggs Benedict and Buttermilk Pancakes.  You certainly don't go away hungry.  The Eggs Benedict were very good, eggs poached perfectly, and a really decent slab of Canadian Bacon.  My dining companion had strawberry crepes, which were good, but she wishes she went with the Eggs Benedict.  When leaving, the line was now out the door!  Glad we went when we did--get there early.",

    "text": "I came here with my family for an early 7:30a Sunday breakfast. The restaurant is tucked in a plaza with ample parking. When we got there, our party of 11 was immediately seated. The interior of the place is pretty plain. Imagine a slightly more simple than the typical IHOP. Our server was great and didn't mess up any of our orders. She refilled our coffees frequently and was quick to fulfilling our requests. 90% of the meals here are less than $10 w/o a drink. I ordered the fresh strawberry pancakes ($8.40), and I was given 6 large pancakes and a generous amount of strawberries. And these weren't the dinky, small strawberries. They were red, ripe and looked just like those you would pick in the fields. My pancakes weren't too fluffy and were a lot bigger than I was expecting (when I hear 6 pancakes in an entree dish, I'm thinking the silver dollar pancake-sized ones). My pancakes came with whipped cream and a side of their fresh strawberry syrup. The portions that I received would have been a bit of a challenge for a normal person to tackle alone.  My family also enjoyed their meals, and from the looks of it, they also had good-sized portions for the price. Unfortnately, we were on a schedule, so I coudn't order the Dutch Oven Baby, which takes 20 minutes to make upon order. But I would be excited to come back and try it! This restaurant is highly recommended if you're in need of a local, delicious breakfast place.",

Each time I've been there are always a lot of people waiting which makes you think there would be a really long wait, however, even with crowds of people waiting I've never had a wait longer than 15-20 minutes. So don't just drive by thinking it's too crowded.   The staff are great. With a restaurant being that busy it would be easy to get flustered, but I've never had bad service. The guy in charge of the waiting list is great at his job (don't remember his name). He keeps the revolving door of people working like a well oiled machine. The wait staff are also good. I've never had a bad waiter/waitress. Very polite and helpful if you need anything. The kitchen must be crazy with all the orders, but the food is always good and comes out fast.   I take all of my out of town guests here and they have all fallen in love with this place.",

    "text": "I honestly don't understand the love the Original Pancake House gets. The fact that their pancakes and their omelets are above-average sized doesn't make them great. In fact, I'd declare they're pretty mediocre, and I've eaten here several times.  There are quite a few things about OPH that irk me to no end, especially at the South Park location.  1. Regarding their pancakes: yes, they're good pancakes. Best pancakes ever? Hardly. Don't get me wrong: if all I had to eat there was a stack of pancakes, I'd be satisfied. But when you hear friends and colleagues rave about OPH's pancakes, you're expecting to have your dirty, hole-filled socks knocked off.   Not so much here.   2. Their omelets are obnoxious-sized. Seriously. They look as if the line cook tried to shove an entire turkey inside a egg wrap.   Look, I get that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That doesn't mean I want an omelet the size of the Hindenburg. I'm not going to finish it. Hell, I may not even last 3 bites. I'm not fond of places that tend to overdo it when it comes to certain plates.   3. In the 5 or 6 times I've eaten here, I've never been waited on by someone who didn't have a shitty attitude. Ask for extra syrup or butter, and they look at you as if you just asked if you could perform all kinds of illegal and immoral sexual acts upon their mother. Considering this is the Bible Belt, some of those acts would seem immoral here, but where I come from, that pretty much constitutes \"going to first base.\" But I digress...  In addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with. You get seated, and maybe, just maybe, your waiter/waitress will take a few minutes from bitching about how much they hate working here - and mind you, I worked my way through college as a waiter, so I sympathize with having to work a crowded restaurant - and maybe they'll realize your coffee's running low and pour you some. Or maybe they'll realize you don't have silverware...while your meal's on the table. You can't eat pancakes with your hand. I mean, you could, but that's barbaric.  4. Speaking of coffee, their coffee is BRUTAL. A warm cup of water with a pathetic sprinkling of coffee grounds is NOT COFFEE. Then I realized they serve Royal Cup Coffee. This is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate. Apparently, the management at OPH hates their customers.  5. Speaking of customers, something about OPH seems to bring out the shitty in some customers. Apparently there's an addictive formula in their pancakes that makes some customers act stupid, although I seem to be immune. Every time I've gone to OPH, I've been seated next to patrons who speak too damned loud and want to share every excruciating detail of their lives, or behave towards their meal as if they'd just escaped from a chain gang and haven't eaten a meal in weeks.   I know I pointed out the crap service, but nothing gets me as angry as a customer that treats a waitress like shit. Dressing down a waitress because she forgot to bring you your egg whites is uncalled for. And the behavior some patrons demonstrate here is a big reason why I won't return to ANY OPH, wherever, whenever. The joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people.  There are better places in town for breakfast.   The thing is, the existence of an establishment like OPH proves the incestuous relationship that takes place between \"well-established\" restaurants that are merely coasting by based upon past glories and name recognition, and a general public either too ignorant to know better, or one that simply doesn't care.",

Ordered rainbow pancakes for my girls, husband had eggs, bacon & hash browns & MIL ordered waffles while I had the Dutch baby.  She told me that the Dutch baby would take approximately 15min & asked if I would want to have all food wait to come out at once & I said no, pls bring out ASAP since my little ones were already hungry & pancakes should be quick to get out. Did she do this? Of course not & we all waited about 20mim for our food.   My husband specifically asked for hash browns but what came out home fries, or more like a breakfast potatoes. When he asked the lady why they weren't hash browns, she proceeded  to argue that in their restaurant, those cut up chunky potatoes were considered hash browns. That went on for a few minutes... Pretty disappointing.... She should've just asked if he wanted something different right away.  Anyways, food was alright... Service was worst. Prob wouldn't go back again.",

I ordered one for me and I heard him say water. When my son said it's ok (to be nice) she didn't offer to take it and I paid for an OJ that he barely drank. OJ should be cold and it was near warm and not very good. On to the food-I ordered the eggs Benedict, which was so-so and a little salty. The potato pancakes were absolutely gross. My son who eats most anything tried them and commented that they tasted metallic-like. I thought the flavor was more fishy.  They were inedible-Thin, soggy, and nasty. The server noticed they weren't eaten and brought me pancakes to take home, which was nice since I didn't ask for anything. I do think the manager should have come by. I cannot believe this place is so popular and that people wait an hour+ to eat mediocre food. We won't be back.",

This one is a good location but gets very busy on the weekends.  The food is always fresh and the service is also good, plus you cannot beat the price.  The food tastes a lot more \"real\" than IHOP and Waffle House and it's just overall a better experience.",

Each crepe itself could have been its own serving.   But I do have to remember that this is the South...so therefore everything comes in extra large.  I wish I was able eat all of it, but the my body will reject the greasy fatty goodness.  So the one crepe that I was able to eat was yum-tastic.",

    "text": "I love this place, I always order the same thing at this location: Hash browns and Eggs, Sub for banana nut Pancakes.  Here is what you need to know: Original Pancake House is a franchise, however it is not the same in all locations, the Charlotte location's both share what appears to be the same menu. I have also visited the one in Northern VA, and South field MI. The main differences are the prices, combinations, and menu layouts. The main thing they all have in common is the best pancakes that you can find at a restaurant period.  That being said, every year after Ramadan ends, Muslim's usually go to breakfast. I credit myself as the person that fought for everyone to go to OPH, which I we know as OHOP, because everyone always wanted to go to iHop. There was a staunch iHOP supporter in our cliche, but she thankfully has retreated to Jordan, but sadly I have also made a tactical withdraw to Michigan where the OPH is not quite the same.   Why OPH, is better than IHOP:  1. They will allow to sub anything for anything, and pay the difference, IHOP will not. example: IHOP will not allow you sub meat for non-meat, even if you don't eat meat!  2. OPH has better options for people who don't want to eat meat, but do want to eat eggs.  example: Hash brown and eggs Combo comes with Pancakes.  3. OPH pancakes are perfection, IHOP pancakes are a joke and are only eaten as a result of good marketing and advertising.   4. OPH has better syrup, made from fresh ingredients. The strawberry syrup is made with real strawberries, The Blueberry is made with real blueberries.  This cannot be said about IHOP. Think about that next time you are at IHOP trying to pull that syrup jug that's stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy IHOP pancakes.  5. OPH omellets are bigger and better, granted that are different style. Example: I brought my friend there, and before we order I asked him, \"Are you ready?\". He didn't what I was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out. I am sure OPH is a great way to put your kids to sleep for the day, worth trying.   IHOP omellets aren't bad as long as they don't cross contaminate your food, with things you don't want.  I think I have made my point, the take away here, is OPH has the best pancakes period, if you know better send me a message or something.",

After relaying that my wife was celiac, she provided us with the gluten free menu.  When the pancakes came out, they were thinner than normal pancakes, but my wife really enjoyed them. Along with her hash browns and eggs, breakfast was a success.  I ordered a short stack with bacon and I was satisfied. The coffee was okay, but nothing to call home about.

They have variety of omelettes and every dish comes with a side of 3 pancakes. The pancakes are good in size and very sufficient. Particularly loved the cups they served tea/coffee in. A must try place for a filling breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner!",

    "text": "Another Saturday morning, another great breakfast at what I believe to be Charlotte's best breakfast destination, The Original Pancake House (OPH) in SouthPark! Always packed, be it breakfast or lunch, OPH serves up consistently great food, all made fresh in house including its whipped cream, tropical syrup, Belgian waffles and crepes.  On this Saturday morning, I opted for the strawberry Belgian waffle with fresh cream for about $8, with a generous side of sausage links for $4. The berries were sweet, fresh, and piled high and the waffle, a perfect golden brown. I enjoyed the sausage links but I prefer  the bacon which is thick-cut and crunchy. My wife ordered the Granny Smith apple waffle which comes loaded  with waffles inside and out. It was also delicious.   Otherwise, I have had most all of the pancake options and love the pecan, strawberry and chocolate chip, but there's not a loser in the bunch. Just close your eyes and point, only make sure you order a side of homemade whipped cream with whatever you choose. The crepes and French toast are very good as well,  especially the Chicken and Almonds Crepe with a side of potato pancakes with fresh apple sauce.  Expect a wait, especially for breakfast, but complimentary coffee is available while you do. If you do happen to experience an off day here (which is rare but should be expected anywhere), I would encourage you to give it another try because this location is truly an exceptional establishment.   Service is old school friendly and always excellent. Sanitation is consistently high.  Predictably, the management is supreme as they always put the customer first and make it clear that they appreciate you as such. Nothing fancy here, just great food, service and prices make it a Gotta Try for me.",

I'm going back for my birthday this weekend & can't wait. Only problem is trying to decide on what to order... because its all THAT GOOD!   Side note- fellow customers, when you are done eating, checks paid & left overs been boxed up... leave! You are costing the wait staff tips by sitting there for a ridiculous amount of time. We watched a couple with a bunch of kids \"hanging out\" for :20 minutes after the table had been cleared. Do the right thing folks!",

The hash browns were more like home fries - but soooo good. I love the way they make em.   I was surprised the coffee was decent - usually expect burnt tasting coffee from a place like this.   There was quite a wait but worth it, and use the Waitlist on Yelp to get in line before you leave the house. They also have free coffee and water while you wait.   Service was friendly and attentive. They're also very organized with a host at the front door on weekends to organize the waitlist.   This is a very diner-style space.  Clean but crowded and the decor isn't your focus with a giant breakfast in front of you! Prices are very affordable, especially for this area.",

I will say that the fact that they have included themselves as part of the Nowait app has made my visits here that much better. While en route (as a passenger, thankyouverymuch), I check the wait times at OPH and then depending on time left of drive, I will add myself and party to the wait list. Each time I've done this, I've been able to walk right in and be seated. GAME CHANGER.  My normal order is the junior plate which comes with one egg (scrambled), two turkey sausage links, and three pancakes. I clean my plate every time. no shame. I try to talk myself into trying something new every time I go but I like what I like!  I must shout out their DELICIOUS home fries. Potatoes well seasoned and cooked with diced onions as well as their insanely thick-cut bacon. Seriously, they have the best bacon slices to be found. Also, they serve coffee piping hot. The way it should always be.  Everyone here from the hostess, to the waitstaff, and check out person have all been friendly in my experience.",

Ordered the Cobb salad with raspberry vinagrette and it was a pretty big salad--no way that I could finish it.  I think why I didn't think it was as good this time around was because there were a lot of people there on Sunday morning and I don't necessarily get the hype of the place.    The food is fairly average, but priced pretty good.  When things get hyped up too much, I generally dismiss it and places rarely ever live up to my expectation.  Will I come here again?  Probably, can't think of any other place that has the variety, price, and casual dining that this place has.  dmo out.",

    "text": "The Original Pancake House (OPH) is my 2nd favorite place for breakfast on the weekends (Pewter Rose is the first).  And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections, including eggs, waffles, and, of course, pancakes.    Since I'm usually an egg person for breakfast, I'm usually steered past the pancakes and waffles and go right for the omelettes or other egg dishes.  Their omelettes are HUGE.  They seem like they're made from like 18 eggs or something.  None of the omelettes really seem to have a lot inside them (the ingredients aren't overflowing), but my favorite is the sausage one.  Also tasty are their seafood crepes and Eggs Michael (Eggs Benedict with sausage instead of Canadian bacon), as well as their regular Eggs Benedict.  And, last but not least, there's the Kosher meal:  eggs with salami and potato pancakes on the side.  YUM!  I'm not Jewish, but I do love a good Kosher breakfast!  (Miami has an awesome Jewish breakfast place, too, but I draw the line at \"tongue.\")  Potato pancakes are a delicious treat -- more tasty than hashbrowns, but not as filling as regular pancakes.    This particular location of the OPH is across the street from the high-end SouthPark Mall, so you think it would be a little more stylish, but it's got that old 80s restaurant feel to it.  A renovation in decorating is definitely needed.  OPH should feel (and look) more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.    If you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!  Or you're looking at about an hour wait.",

I get one of these dishes every time. The oat meal is really tasty, too. It's thick and hearty, not watery at all. The hashbrowns are the best in town, in my opinion. Chunks of potatoes and onions and yummy seasoning. If you're planning on arriving after 9am on a saturday or sunday be prepared to wait. They move people in and out pretty quickly, though! I've never had to wait very long for my food to arrive at the table and truthfuly, it gets inhaled pretty quickly because it's just so tasty!",

It was during the week and mid morning so we were seated right way.  This is a tight restaurant using every bit of real estate available.  Our server was very attentive.  The pancakes have a wonderful cake flavor to them.  Almost like cake batter ice cream.  My husband got the cheese omelet.  The omelet seemed to be a little watered down.  I got the feta, mushroom, spinach and tomato omelet and it was loaded with fixings.  However the egg was a little thin.   Overall a good breakfast.

I had it in my head that OPH was going to be 1. expensive, because Southpark and 2. crazy crowded.  On a weeknight around 7:00, I was wrong on both counts.  Now, don't get it twisted - on the weekends, this place stays at full capacity, but the Tuesday dinner crowd was light, seemingly consisting of mostly regulars.    With a prime corner spot in the shopping center, parking is plentiful but the lot is crammed and the spots are on the narrow side (for those of us killing the planet in our SUV's).  I was warmly greeted when I entered and promptly seated.  My waiter came over immediately to get my drink order, came back a moment later and I was ready to order.  My food came out very quickly, and was smoking hot.  My food: 2 eggs over well - cooked perfectly.  Eggs were fresh and delicious. 4 slices of turkey bacon - it seemed to be Butterball?  It tasted exactly like what I make at home, only it wasn't burned like I always manage to do.   3 pancakes - so good, so very very good.  Fluffy, not crazy sweet - with butter and some ample pours of the warm syrup, I could have eaten my body weight in these pancakes and I find myself craving them.  The total for my meal, without tip, was $8 (I had water to drink).  The food was delicious, service was wonderful, the gentleman who seemed to be the boss that evening was very pleasant.  I will definitely return to OPH.",

Our waitress greeted us right away and gave us menus to review.   I already knew what I wanted, I was a little disappointed that there was no \"build your own option\" on the omelet menu. I mean don't get me wrong they had some pretty awesome choices Western, Veggie, Ham and Bacon but none that you could customize on your own. Oh well.... I customized my ordered and chose a ham omelet, add spinach and cheese.   My mouth was watering as all the entrees came flying out the kitchen! I could hardly wait, our waitress brought our a plate with some butter and syrup and then it was time to dig in!  My omelet was huge! It's a four egg omelet....I mean does it get much better than that??? It was hot and cheesy! And they did not skimp on the toppings! Every bite had some ham, and spinach...so that was awesome! The pancakes were light and fluffy and just simply delicious!  Everything with this place was totally right, look forward to going back!",

We ended up still going with an omelette, The Western, with its usual side of pancakes. We also split an Eggs Benedict with the crispy hash browns. Everything was absolutely amazing. Service was great, and we both cleaned our plates. Their omelette's are huge so I'm always quite proud of myself when I can make a huge dent.   I especially liked the Eggs Benedict. Nothing quite like poached eggs and Canadian bacon on an English muffin. I've also had their Eggs Michael before, which is equally as delicious. I can't be sure but I believe the hollandaise is replaced with a sherry mushroom sauce.  Every time we come here, we leave happy. We have been to both locations and have never had a bad experience. You get what you pay for, unlike a lot of other overpriced breakfast spots in Charlotte. I highly recommend!",

My personal favorite is the waffle with strawberries.   And it comes with a strawberry syrup.    Their bacon is the best in town.  Thick cured and flavorful bacon.  Yum!  The staff is always friendly and the wait time is never as bad as other restaurants.",

    "text": "I have been here a few times and every time has been less than impressed with both the service and the food. Most recently, I went here on a Sunday for brunch with my family. The chicken sandwich I ordered was awful. The chicken was undercooked. Despite \"looking\" cooked on the outside, I could tell by the texture that it was not fully cooked - it totally grossed me out and I couldn't eat it. I told the server about it, and he looked at me like he didn't believe me and made some comment that it was cooked on a flat top. He walked away with my plate in hand, and never returned to ask if I would like anything else or to even refill my empty iced tea. I just sat there for 25 minutes while my party ate their food.   I never send food back, but uncooked chicken is a deal breaker for me. I understand busy kitchens, and sometimes the chef misjudges how well cooked the chicken may be. We all make mistakes. But there is no reason to mistreat the customer, especially in this situation. The fact that the server proceeded to ignore me completely while I sat there watching the rest of my party eat their food was just rude. Sure, the server took my meal off the bill, but the fact that I was treated so poorly made an impression that no \"credit\" could make up for. I will never go back to OPH and highly recommend anyone considering a trip there consider other options.",

When w got there, there was a wait. They told us 15 minutes, but it was more like 5, which is always a pleasant surprise.   I ordered the strawberry pancakes, which is 6 pancakes, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and warm strawberry syrup. I also had a side of bacon. My husband had 2 eggs, fried, with bacon and an order of three pancakes. Both of our meals were wonderful! The pancakes are smaller than what you get at IHOP, but so, SO much better. They're light, fluffy, and delicious. The strawberries were super sweet on their own, and between those, the whipped cream and the dusting of powdered sugar, you don't need much syrup. But add some anyways ;)  The bacon was thick cut and delicious.   The service was quick, our server was friendly and efficient. This is definitely a favorite spot for breakfast in Charlotte.",

I didn't like the syrup or the pancakes, the taste of one was just a little different and not in a great way. The do have outdoor seating and WiFi , so that's a definite plus. WS were there on Sunday afternoon and it was busy, but the wait wasn't long. Friendly enough employees. I had an omelette, pancakes and bacon. The bacon was a bit chewy. I didn't eat it all and I am a Bacon lover! It's more of a diner feel. It was close to my hotel, so I gave it a try. Next time, I will visit another spot. Don't think I will return.

She got the oatmeal with raisins and nuts. I had the Belgian waffle with a side of grits while my wife ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with hash brown potatoes. There potatoes were big chunks fried. I don't call these hash browns and I am not too fond of then this way.",

Today was the strawberry blintzes, which are crepes wrapped around a strawberry and custard filling, then topped with strawberry syrup and real (not canned) whipped cream.  You can't go wrong here. Their omelets are baked rather than grilled, which means that they come out tall and fluffy, stuffed with goodness. Or try the Dutch Baby, a huge pancake bowl that needs only lemons and hold the powdered sugar. The pancakes are also rather fluffy and I love the doughyness of them, topped with fresh strawberries and hot syrup.  I see people get the eggs and bacon and I wonder... dude!
