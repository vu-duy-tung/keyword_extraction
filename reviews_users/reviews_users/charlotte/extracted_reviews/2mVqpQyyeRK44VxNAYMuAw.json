Congratulations. If you haven't been there yet get there! All of the food is excellent.",

We had a 1/2 chicken with green beans and a house salad, and a 1/4 chicken with green beans and rice. It was all delicious and fresh. We dined in, and while it took a bit to be served, it wasn't horribly long. The reason for the three stars is the service and atmosphere. The server brought the order and my meal was wrong. She did take the plate away but didn't say anything to me and it took longer to replace than we expected. My companions meal was almost cold by the time I was served the right meal.  This location had only been open for a day, and I think every Viva Chicken manager within a 500 mile radius was there. It was interesting none were female. The amount of Bro Bonding going on behind me, to the side of me and in front of me was ridiculous and distracting. One guy even had his fly open. Slightly disturbing while trying to eat after seeing that. Don't get me wrong here. The food is great. The service was not, and the manager meet ups going on all around us for our entire ruined it for us.",

We decided to order out this time, it's cold out we are watching the Saints loose the division game (shamelessly) and we didn't feel like going anywhere. Well, my chicken was undercooked, a bit bloody near the bone  very disappointed because i didn't want to go back out to restaurant and bring it back and face that Waverley traffic that is getting worst by the minute and I'm pretty sure I just got a bit of a stomachache. This place is great in service and I've never gotten bad food before, I can see it's always busy, has become one of the most popular places in the new park. If you read this please keep an eye on your food quality you don't want to risk clientele or even worse get people sick.  1/15 Update :  I was contacted by Viva Chicken with an apology for my experience, this speaks loud of their excellent service and will to continue being one of he best, thanks for listening to your customers :) I will continue going to your restaurant and invite all to try their food if you haven't yet.",

Since it was a new location, the wife and I decided to break away from our regular stuffed avocado and saltado order.    I got the tacu bowl with chicken, and it was outstanding.  Really important to order this with the cilantro infused rice as it adds a nice layer.  The pickled onions on top were a perfect sour note to counter the 'red sauce' that I could eat with anything...I was a happy camper.    The wife ordered the 1/4 chicken, but the star of the show was the solterito side. It had two kinds of beans, feta cheese, pickled onions and fresh tomatoes... Super fresh.    For the first time, we got the Tres Leches, and while it cream soaked sponge cake with a marshmallow frosting (sooo good) it was actually light.  The denseness that usually comes with a dessert was not there.    As for the location, I am so happy I don't have to drive to Johnston Rd now.  There is plenty of parking, and after dinner, we were able to walk around Waverly and grabbed a drink next door.",

    "text": "The absolute best deal is the \"Whole chicken + 3 large sides\" ($23.95). It's enough to feed a family of 4 or 5. As our side items, I ordered Yuca Fries, Green Beans, and the Solterito Salad (edamame, corn). I love the Aji Amarillo Sauce -- it goes fantastic with everything. The Huancaina Sauce (creamy queso fresco) is aight -- it comes with the Yuca Fries, but isn't as flavorful as the yellow sauce. The Cup of Quinoa Side ($3.75) is not worth its price. It is barely a cup's worth and is on top of some lettuce/romaine. The Yuca Fries are the BEST I've ever had at any restaurant -- crispy all over, with a melt in your mouth inside. The rotisserie chicken is the all-star item that brings all the boys (and girls) to the yard -- it's perfectly seasoned, juicy, and delicious. The Quinoa Avocado is fantastic ($6.95) and if you add chicken ($2.45), it's a meal in itself, as it has organic quinoa, red pepper, rocoto mayo, balsamic vinaigrette. The Arroz Chaufa ($6.95) is Peruvian take on Asian fried rice, but with red peppers, green onions, eggs, ginger, and Peruvian soy sauce. I absolutely love this place -- and there is a reason that the line is always long!",

They have different sauces you can try, but my favorite is the yellow one. It's so good with the fried rice. They are usually pretty fast and have plenty of seating-- though we usually get it to go. One order of fried rice feeds two adults easily. I tried a few of their speciality drinks once and didn't really like them, so I would try them before you purchase. This is one of our regular go-tos when I don't want to make dinner.",

I chose a Cobb salad that had the freshest ingredients, including golden raisins, avocado, the hugest kernels of corn I have ever seen, and roasted pulled Peruvian chicken.  Although I have dined at other Viva locations, this was my favorite experience so far. The food just tasted so FRESH!   We sat outside on the patio in perfect autumn weather.  Everyone who worked there was super friendly, almost unbelievably so.  Oh, don't forget to get a side of the yuca.   The world needs more yuca!   Two thumbs up!",

We ordered and everything was smooth until our order. We got home excited to try it and opened the box and IT WAS THE WRONG ORDER. It was missing items that we had ordered. Good thing we only live a short drive away so we could go back and get it fixed. We went in and the lady that works there she said she will give us the items that were missing but she cannot make it fresh. What really got me is how another lady came up saying her order was late and the lady who was helping us ended up giving her gift cards meanwhile we stood there with our order wrong and she gave us an attitude. It has me wondering why she didn't give us anything to make up for the terrible service.",

It's not dry and the seasoning is great. The red and green sauces are my go to but don't forget the yellow. The yellow sauce is a good lighter heat with a honey mustard twang. I got cilantro rice as one of my sides... It is incredible. Seriously some of the best rice I have ever had. For my second side I chose the green beans to balance out the meal. I like the green beans because they don't turn into mush but have a good crunch and are a great combo with the rice and chicken. My fiancee and I definitely frequent this Viva chicken quite often. We honestly wanted Italian and instead we went here so it's pretty damn good.",

The music at the this location is HORRIBLE! Whoever picked this music for your casual dining pleasure should be fired and run out of town. Loud, abusive, with a driving beat that WILL NOT allow you to enjoy your meal or the friends you are there with. It's invasive and raises both your anxiety level and your blood pressure.  Makes you want to either rip your ears off so you don't have to be subjected to that raucousness or to take you food to go.  Looks like the Johnson Road location will now be our go to. Too bad. It's in such a great location and in the middle of a lifestyle center that will thrive and grow. Won't be long before it's replaced by another restaurant at this rate. (Or they'll get rid of the manager who was in the building the entire time we were there.)  And did I mention that the choice of music and volume is horrible?",

I haven't ventured far from my favorite dish, 1/4 white with green beans and side salad. But that alone is reason enough for me to return time after time.  As boring as this meal may sound to some it truly hits the spot and keeps me CLOSE to my healthy eating plans.  I love to double dip my chicken into the yellow mild, then the green medium and a drop of red to top it off. The green sauce is perfect as the salad dressing giving it a mildly spicy kick that won't burn your buds. But the real deal is to top the green beans with just a touch of the mild yellow and VOILA...its the perfect amount of flavor and a TINY bit of heat.",

My favorites are the stuffed avocado- secret- you can get half and add chicken and it's prefect size for me. The stuffed avocado is literally a full half of avocado filled with quinoa and then I add the chicken and it has 2 sauces that go on top.. I love them both. Gosh I love that, but their chicken soup is my favorite ANYWHERE. Just such a clean broth and fresh herbs on top.. so good. They have specialty sauces at the back of the restaurant but they're all too spicy for me, I just request more of the brown sauce, I think it's a vinaigrette. Don't forget the juices when you order. They make 3 in house daily all fresh marinated with fruits and herbs, you can't go wrong. So excited I have one so close now!!",

My friends had sweet potato fries that I got to try too. They're great to dip in the sauces. Same with the yuca. I wish I was given more in my serving haha. They're hard to make and made well here.

The seasonings bring out the wonderful flavor to the chicken so much so that you won't need or want to add one of their amazing sauces. YUM!  And the sides as well. Yuca can be a little tough or chewy, but not today. It is fried perfectly crisp on the outside while somehow still being soft on the inside.  The plantains are caramelized and sweet. And the rice is also perfectly cooked and seasoned. I would have liked a warmer greeting while ordering, but I did finally get my cashier to smile by complimenting her cat eyeliner, which totally rocked, but has nothing to do with my review.  So all in all, WTG Viva-Waverly. You are my fav in this chain!",

    "text": "I went here last week with my brother, and I had no idea what to expect! When you walk in, you go to the counter and order your meal, and then you get a number and they'll bring it out to you. There are so many things to choose from. The salads that I saw looked huge and delicious, as do the sandwiches! My brother said that he always gets 1/4 chicken with two sides, and since that sounded tasty, I decided to follow suit. (Especially since this way I could try two sides, and we all know the sides are the best part-Am I right??)   After we ordered we were lucky enough to find a table. It was hoppin' busy at 7:30pm on a Friday night! Which, I take as a very good sign. Once you've claimed your table, you can go up to the common area to get silverware, napkins, and sauces. There are three types of sauces. One has a red sign, and is hot, so I didn't even try it. Ha! One has a green sign, and it has a lot of herbs in there, maybe cilantro. That one was okay. The last sauce has a yellow sign, and it was good. Definitely the most mild sauce they have, almost more of a creamy sauce.   Then we waited, it did take a few minutes longer for the food to arrive than I would've thought, but like I said, they were busy. The food was really good, and I feel like I got a good size portion for the price. The chicken had a lot of seasoning on it, definitely more than just salt and pepper! There are some other herbs there, and it gives it more of a Mediterranean feel. The chicken had a good skin, and my piece was fairly juicy. My cilantro rice was very good! It had good flavor. Lastly, the plantains. I'm a sucker for plantains, because I never see them anywhere. My order came with maybe 4 of them, and they were warm and big and juicy, and just perfection! I will definitely be back here!",

My usual is the Tacu Bowl, which is rice topped with pulled rotisserie chicken, cilantro, avocado and other great stuff.  Three delicious sauces are available self-serve, but be warned, the hot is indeed HOT. The dining room is festive but maybe a bit too loud for some. Service is consistently friendly and attentive, and sanitation score is typically in the high 90's. Have only had good experiences here.",

The staff is also very pleasant and helpful as you navigate the menu.  I ordered the Sopa de Pollo (chicken soup) and it was fantastic! It comes topped with an amazing assortment of fresh veggies and is very filling.  No noodles,  just a lot of chicken with rice.  I also had the Yucca Fries side. Comes with 8 fries and a delicious dipping sauce.  Definitely a delight.  Crisp and light and a perfect side dish.  I would also suggest getting the Herbal Limeade.   It's different from other limeades but oh so delicious.  The mint flavore comes through and is so thirst quenching!   I'll definitely be returning to try and review additional items!",

    "text": "Viva Chicken Limena Chopped Salad, lime passion fruit dressing w.steak. An ONLINE, pickup order, which I then called to clarify the chickpeas were not breaded & fried bc I am gluten sensitive, and I did not want red onions. She said none of that is in the dish. Super! Fresh chopped kale & romaine (they had me right there!) topped with edamame,  Peruvian corn, (?)baked chickpeas, bacon, a diced tomato mixture & queso. The dressing was a refreshing blend of sweet fruit and acidic citrus that mixed well with the ingredients..... Ingredients which DID have diced red onions. Im guessing in the tomato mixture, which is not listed as an ingredient. Oh well, everything else was delicious. I'm thinking, the next time I will ask how the chickpeas are crisped!:- / Service is so expeditious they even have baggies individually, hand-rolled where to put the sauce cups! This place is one well-oiled machine that pays attention to details!  Yes, one mistake tonight, which could be serious if I was allergic. Thankfully, I am not; it's just a preference. And, I'm confident all of the staff will now know every ingredient (or ask) & their menu will be updated.  Still gives me a comfy, fulfilling feeling every time I come. Everything has always been fresh! Also bc I am somewhat a clean-phobe and this place sparkles!",

They have three sauces that you serve yourself that I don't know the names of, but I love the yellow and green. Yellow is the mildest. They both add good flavor to the rice dish. The Herbal Limeade is refreshing and different, with the hints of mint, basil, and rosemary.",

I'm sure if it got closer to 12 it would be packed. We ordered right away and got a booth by the window.   I got the 1/4 chicken with the rice and soup. The chicken was so tender and fall off the bone. The rice adds a nice touch to it. I was so full by then I took my soup home. The soup is my favorite part. It's so flavorful and perfect for a cold night!!   Service was good and the restaurant was super clean!",

They obviously don't have to and not a lot of places like this do, but it's a nice added touch.  It makes one feel welcome.  Plus you can also tell they work hard.    The food is good like always.

My husband likes to get the wraps (great wrap is his favorite) and they are always pretty generous in size.   This is a good spot to come to with a group, or to get takeout, or even come to on a date. Technically it's fast casual, but the servers constantly come around to check on you and get you refills, so it feels like a more upscale restaurant. We usually sit out in the terrace, and the manager will even come check on us and ask if we need the music down or the heater on. It really feels like a cheers-type restaurant even though it's a chain. Highly recommended!",

The only downside was that the chef was heavy handed with the red onion, which I didn't like, but I just removed them and everything was good.  I also had the herbal limeade to drink , which was a little cilantro forward for me, but I tasted the passionfruit juice, which was soo good. Lastly, I wanted to try a churro, and it was warm and sweet and worth the money considering it was 10 inches long. I'll definitely  be back to try some other menu items.",
