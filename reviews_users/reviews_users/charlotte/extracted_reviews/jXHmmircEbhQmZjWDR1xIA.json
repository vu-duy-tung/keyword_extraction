When we first sat down we ordered cocktails,  which didn't come out until 30 minutes later, and were brought out one at a time, several minutes apart. The food was brought to the table with no plates. Our water glasses were not refilled. The rice and seafood dish was not edible. After ordering a second round of cocktails thst never came despite asking our waiter several times,  we canceled our order and left. We will never go back.",

I asked to speak to the manager to get some type of sympathy, apology, compensation for the inconvenience that was out of our & ofcourse their control! I was told that the manager was very busy trying to attend to the current dishwasher situation & could not speak with me. So, there we were standing outside the restaurant trying to figure out what we would do next. Along comes our saviour, one of the waitresses suggested that we try Soul Gastrolounge, so we did...",

They were not extremely busy but we had a longer than average wait time to be seated.  No one besides us were waiting to be seated.  The waitress, which was also the hostess, informed us that they were cleaning a table off for us.  After about 10 minutes we were seated at a table with hair on it.  I will say our server was very pleasant. After placing our order we had to wait another 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  I ordered the French toast which was delicious, however it was only one slice.  Needless to say I was still hungry. In addition 2 out of the 3 checks were miscalculated.  I was thoroughly disappointed and dont think I will be visiting there again.",

    "text": "Bistro La Bon is definitely a nice place to take that special someone to impress w/ atmosphere (see inside dining area), maybe even for brunch after that special night out. But if you are just \"some dude\" looking for quality food and a nice price...then La Bon may not work best for you. **Note, this review is just based on their Sunday brunch.**   Atmosphere - sketchy parking area in a strip mall, friendly, busy, little noisy, confusing, frantic staff, cordovan colored square wooden tables and chairs, warm colors, dark stained concrete flooring.   Service - It was the brunch buffet on a Sunday, so it was \"buffet quality\".   Food - Here is what I liked: the French Toast (it did rock and was made to order), the macaroons (rival my fav from Enrico Biscotti in Pittsburgh) and...the rest was just \"OK\". The chocolate waffle (made to order) was decent but did not 'wow' me. The all spice or pumpkin flavored pastries filled with cream cheese were just 'eh' (bad that I could not tell the difference). The eggs were...and the chicken and beef were...OKAY, OKAY, OKAY...I hate buffets!!! There I said it! It is a freaking germ fest and the food is NEVER as good as if you ordered it ala carte!   Sh-wooo, I am glad I got that off my chest! I could never work for the CIA, I just cave too quickly!   Overall - I thought $14 was pricey for a buffet and you are probably better served to try this place for lunch or in the evenings for a fancy dinner. Unless you enjoy the possibility of someone being just a sneeze guard away from giving you H1N1. Time to use the hand sanitizer.",

    "text": "Some of my favorite reviewers gave this place 4 stars, so I was happy about going out there today for a scheduled CMYE.  I've been gone almost five hours, and I'm still pissed.  I am not sure if I caught them on a bad day, or the fact that the reviews I respect are almost five months old.  Either way, \"totally unimpressed\" is the kindest thing I can say about both the place, and the CMYE. (I'll pan the CMYE later, if someone is silly enough to open a review page for it)  I approached the buffet table, and the first items I saw were what appeared to be some sort of beef and poultry.  Both absolutely sucked!  The beef was remarkably tender.  I like a braised/pot roast style beef as much as the next guy.  This beef was so overcooked, that had I tasted it blindfolded, I would not have been sure what I was eating.  The poultry was actually a bit slimy, and the flavor was mediocre at best.  I gathered from another review that one of the items I was eating was a black forest ham & pasta salad.  Really?!  As God is my witness, while I was eating it, I thought I was eating some sort of salmon concoction.  I remember seeing the words \"black forest\" taped to the sneeze guard.  I wondered to myself while eating, what is black forest about this salmon?!  No wonder!  It was ham!!  The potato gratin was both cold and flavorless.  The scrambled eggs might have been velvety five months ago.  The were clumped blech today.  The crispy bacon was cooked perfectly.  If it actually had any flavor, it might have been a saving grace.  The swedish meatballs were actually decent, and the sweet potato dish was pretty good, but for $21.00 (buffet, iced tea, and tip) I was actually longing for the Golden Corral.  I missed Howie, Terry, Michael, and Jimmy for this sh#t?!  Not a second time!!!!",

Oh my goodness oh my goodness...whether you favor gratins or chocolate waffles, lip-smacking french toast or creamy orzo salad, buttery brisket or delectable coconut macaroons, there is something for everybody here. And, honestly, this buffet (for $14.95 per person) is a pretty sweet deal any way you cut it. A few of the standouts in this tasty spread...  Macaroons: ZOMG. I was ready to open my purse and go all covert ops on the buffet to smuggle out a tray of these perfectly crafted coconut macaroons. No joke, they are some of the best I've ever had.   French Toast: Buttery, velvety magic. Perfectly made with the right amount of syrup. Just an FYI - you'll have to order the chocolate waffles and this French toast with your server, even though it's included in the buffet price.   Sweet Potato Gratin: It sounds as delicious as it tasted. My tastebuds were dancing a jig of massive proportions.   So, um, yeah, I'll be back to Bistro La Bon in the very near future. NOM!",

Whether you are looking for sweet or savory, simple or creative they have offerings in their well styled buffet table to suit your cravings.  Don't believe me? They have beet salad, roasted vegetables, house-cured salmon and roast but they also offer you fresh, juicy fruit, macaroons to die for, french toast and the unbelievably light and fluffy chocolate Belgian waffles, topped with chocolate sauce of course. (You have to request the latter two from your server but that is only because they are made to order. Don't worry, they are included in the brunch price). They deal in the classics such as scrambled  eggs, bacon and salad, but they also step outside the normal brunch box with black forest pasta salad, swedish meatballs and peach chutney.  The service is adequate and even with a large group, a reservation ensured their was plenty of space for out party. Frankly, you can't really beat the deal either.  $14 dollars gets you your fill of everything mentioned above and more (Drinks are extra, and while $4 for a bloody mary is a deal, I can't really go out of my way to recommend it. Try a mimosa maybe.)  Bistro La Bon definitely knows what they are doing when it comes to a buffet brunch and I am looking forward to seeing what they bring to a standard sit down meal. In the mean time, you should belly up to the warming table and grab yourself a plate.",

The atmosphere is not at all what I expected - don't let it's location in the strip fool you. It's really spacious, great decor, dim lighting... the perfect setting for a date.   The location is kind of sketchy (like a lot of Plaza Midwood), and has had some recent crimes, but it was fairly quiet on the night I went.

After seeing it on the list of restaurants for restaurant week I decided to make reservations and finally give this place a shot. Dinner was awesome the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I was not impressed with the potato hash like substance that my salmon sat atop and the cramp space which caused server rear end on our table while taking the order of the table next to us. This meal was 4 courses which is rare during restaurant week. Course 1 We started with salads 1 yummy mixed greens salad with watermelon and a puree feta topping and 1 beet salad that was so tasty.  Course 2 Asparagus & avocado spring rolls as well as the fried Brussels. Both were amazing, I've never had Brussels that taste so good and the thought of asparagus mixed with avocado is yum-deli-umptious :-) Course 3 Scottish Salmon atop a potato like succotash. I wasn't a huge fan of the succotash but I did eat it. The salmon was PERFECT I ordered it medium Course 4 (Final course) Chocolate mouse and banana bread pudding with ice cream. Ooh my ooh my the bread pudding was EVERYTHING and then some.   This place is a hidden gem as I've driven past this parking lot heading to Soul Gastrolounge on numerous occasions and didn't notice this place. I'll be back to try the brunch with my family.",

    "text": "Although I thoroughly loath Duran Duran's music, Simon Le Bon has succeeded in the bistro business in a way he never could with music. Discount cocktail night has become a regular event for my friends and I not to mention, they always have great craft food available too.  But on a more personal note, last time I was there, I unknowingly left my Ray-Bans at my table. Days went by and I searched all over my desk, house, car, etc. and couldn't find them anywhere. My last ditch effort was going to be calling La Bon because I went there 3 days prior for cocktail night but I highly doubted someone hadn't stolen them by that time and my spirits were low. When I did call, I told the hostess the situation, she took my number down, and said she's ask around the staff. A couple hours later she called me back and said they DID in fact have them and that they'd be waiting for me whenever I was ready to pick them up. CAN I GET A HECK FRIGGIN YES?!?! I have the utmost respect for the staff at La Bon because, if put in the same situation, I don't know what I would have done if a stranger left their valuables at my disposal and didn't call for days. But it is because of the great staff at La Bon that I can continue masquerading as a bad boy wannabe in my edgy designer sunglasses and James Dean jackets. And for that I thank you.",

I started off with mimosas (mine were more like champagne with a splash of OJ... just the way I like them), and had the crab cakes benedict as my entree. The dish came with a potato cake side which was more impressive and delicious than the benedict! Overall, my brunch ticket was around $25 with tip.  The restaurant itself is cozy and comfy, and accommodated our table of 10+ with no hesitation. We were seated at a large \"family dining\" type table with one row of chairs and the other was a padded bench with pillows. Our server, Malakai, was top notch and friendly, and I didn't feel rushed through my meal at all with him.  I heard they have a brunch buffet on Sundays, so I'm excited to try that out, as well as dinner at some point.",

We tried the Vanilla Orange Creme Brulee, Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake, and the Bourbon Brioche Bread Pudding with caramel sauce & vanilla ice cream with mango sorbet. The easy favorite of the night was the chocolate truffle cake and the mango sorbet. The creme brulee was delicious but we missed the vanilla orange flavor completely. Next time you're in the area head over to Bistro la Bon and get something sweet :)",

I guess that's why there are always people eating at the bar.   My recommendation is request a good server when making the reservation. Again, the food is great!

Just understand real estate isn't cheap, and this is a gem among cz's.   The first time I went to BLB it was all about the lunch menu, which was either 10 or 12 bucks and included a drink, salad, bread and a meal. I had the Swedish meatballs and lingonberry...my goodness, this is NOT IKEA meatballs. Tender, juicy, super flavorful and smothered in gravy. Salad delicious and fresh. The value was insane and I vowed to go back again.   The second time, was for brunch, which was spectacular. SMORGASBOARD of culinary delights. The meatballs were there, along with brisket that melted in your mouth. Fresh pastries, baked breads, to-order French toast or chocolate waffles, salads, pastas, you name it!!   The quality was great, everything cooked to perfection.   Then...came my fifth time. (yeah, we went for brunch a whole bunch) Something was sorely amiss. The roasted veggies weren't fully roasted and were hard. The pork was tough. The service with taking away plates, slow.   I'm really hoping the 5th star can be earned with those improvements. Bistro La Bon does up classy food in a relaxed setting. Unpretentious and well executed. Just wish the consistency of the brunch comes back!!",

I mean I love French, and I love Simon La Bon, so come on - a match made in heaven! It was made for me. However, I visited twice and we were underwhelmed. First was a very uninspiring food experience.  The next was decent food but an apathetic service experience. Le sigh.    We started with their equivalent of caprese with buffalo mozzarella which oddly tasted more like bleu cheese than mozz. I left it for him to eat. Then we had the tempura fried avocado and asparagus which was actually quite good with the sweet chili sauce (would be plain without). The gap between ordering and getting our food took so long (65 minutes) that we were starving and noticed that other tables had bread, but apparently you have to ask for it from the server explicitly.  We seemed to get more attention from neighboring table's server instead.  The scallops with deconstructed seafood chowder was good but not filling, so this is good \"chick meal.\"  The fish I had was quite tasty, although a little well done.  A previous fish I had once before at lunch was much less flavorful than this one.  Bottom line: We might go back to try the Sunday brunch, but it's overrated for lunch and dinner.",

    "text": "Overall, this is the best food I've had in Charlotte, which I know doesn't say much, but it's also some of the best food I've ever had, anywhere.   Atmosphere:  This place has an ever so slightly upscale appearance, but down to earth enough that you feel comfortable dressed down. Very open and airy. Classy enough for an anniversary date, comfortable enough for a casual dinner with friends.   Service:  We've had excellent service here. Slightly pushy with suggesting things, which is fine, just not my favorite style of service. Being vegetarian it's always a drag to hear the waitress rave on and on and suggest we try some braised venison or the pork chops that fall off the bone. Perhaps ask of any dietary restrictions before rambling on about something that sounds disgusting or is off limits to a patron.  Food:  This is the thing about the food: The flavors are complex in a perfect way. It's how you'd expect gourmet food to taste. There are layers of flavor that you can't place, but that all work well together and create some sort of symphony in your mouth. And this applies to everything, even the little apple pastries that look like they'd be boring are a surprise of complex flavors. Give everything a try, you'll likely be surprised. I truly admire chefs who can accomplish this.   Cost: It's expensive, no question. Brunch is $18/plate. It's not outrageous, especially considering the quality, but it's not something you're going to do every week or even every month. But it's absolutely worth it when you do.  Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here:  Gordon Ramsey. I think it might be the only place in the world he wouldn't have a seizure over the quality of the food.   Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here:  If you could just make bullets out of everything on the buffet and gun me down in the face, I'd die happy.",

I should say upfront that we went for the Sunday brunch, which is *only* all-you-can-eat buffet for $20. Guess we should have done our research as a) neither of us was $20 hungry and b) the buffet was very limited with just a few items (meatballs, mac and cheese, kielbasa, pastries). Definitely not a $20 buffet. And on top of that, the coffee and orange juice were extra ($4 each). So we each paid $24 for a drink and a piece of French toast.  That's not to say I wouldn't go back on a Saturday when you can order a la carte (which is what they should also offer on Sunday) but I would not recommend the Sunday brunch as it's just mediocre for a kind-of-high-price-tag.",

They're not open on Mondays, so, since my twins are at camp this week, we came in on Tuesday.  This place has tablecloths, cloth napkins, nice china, and relatively comfortable surroundings. They have four or five outdoor tables, and a surprisingly large indoor seating area, with a bar/lounge area near the entrance that looks pretty posh and comfy.   Waiters are polished and polite, attentive without being smothering. They're also very enthusiastic, to the point of almost gushing about the food and how good it is. They're trying hard.   The food IS good. Check out the menus in the photo section here. My wife and daughter and I sampled two small plates as appetizers, and devoured our three entrees. Entree portion sizes are just about right.  The hummus is good, although we are hummus lovers, so we've had better (but not often). The olive, pickle, edamame sampler was yummy!  They did a good job on everything else, too (see my photos). My wife thought the bok choy was a little salty, but my daughter liked it that way. I didn't try it.  The dill potatoes were very tasty. The Salmon was great, according to my wife. Pan Seared Branzino (European Sea Bass) was excellent. I have no idea what's in that sauce, but it's decadent!  The veggie sandwich looked great. I wish I had ordered that. My daughter could live to 100 if she keeps eating that stuff.  The few suggestions I have for these folks are to put some art on the walls and to put some interesting treatments on the (rest of the) windows. The views of the industrial neighborhood and the power lines outside aren't that attractive. A bit of carpet, or sound-deadening material on the floors, ceiling, or walls, is in order, too, if possible. The place was pretty loud, and there were only six or seven other occupied tables there when we were.  Those complaints are minor. All in all, this is a very nice restaurant. My daughter paid them her highest compliment: \"I want my next boyfriend to bring me here.\" She's pretty picky, being a vegetarian AND lactose intolerant, and she found really satisfying choices here.   I concluded I need an excuse to come back here and hang with friends in the bar for a while. It just looked relaxing.    Take $20 to $35 per person, depending upon hunger and thirst for alcohol. I think it's worth it.",

    "text": "Bistro La Bon... I officially award you \"Best Brunch in P/M\". It's a heavy crown. Wear it well.  For 14 bucks (used to be 12, but we'll get back to that in a sec) you can stuff your face (or nibble, delicately, if you're one of THOSE people) with high quality, Scandi-merican dishes, breads, sauces, gratins, meats and of course, buttery, velvety scrambled eggs. And fruit. And salad. AND made-to-order chocolate waffles (really, really good- more cocoa than sweet, topped with chocolate sauce and fruit) OR french toast (soaking with egg and cream, some of the best I've ever had or made).  Service is upscale-dinner attentive. Drinks are extra (and the coffee is pretty bad). But the food is superlative for buffet-style and holds it's own in diversity, freshness and flavor against Lulu's a la carte spread and Zada Jane's vegetarian friendliness.   So, I was admittedly a little cranks when we got our bills and noticed the 2 dollar up. But it seems that the extra couple-bucks-per is being reinvested directly into what's on offer, which is right where it should be going. Today's special plate for me was a roulade - pesto and roasted peppers wrapped in super-thin house-made mozzarella, dressed in olive oil. The first few bites had me wondering whether I was eating crepes or extremely light pasta. It was amazing. Seems to me they made the choice - either tone down the quality and variety, or charge what they need in order to offer something truly unique. I'm glad they chose the latter.  My only wish - better coffee, included in the meal. Then it's five stars all the way.",

    "text": "So, a friend calls me up on a Saturday night and asks if I want to go to brunch at Bistro La Bon.  Being the picky eater that I am I had to check out the menu first before I could commit.  The menu looked doable so I told her sure.    The next day I'm driving to the restaurant and my GPS leads me into a strip mall and I said this can't be right.  With a name like Bistro La Bon I'm expecting valet parking and some ritzy, exclusive location.  I pull into a parking spot to check the address again and realize that I am where I am supposed to be.  I look up and see that the restaurant is at the end of the strip mall by the Family Dollar.  Obviously, I'm thinking where in the heck has my friend brought me.  I walked inside and was pleasantly surprised.  The decor was warm and inviting and the place was packed.    My friend and I were lead to our table and our server explains that we can get food from the buffet as well as order food from the kitchen.  I went to the buffet and ended up with a plate of 4 or 5 grapes and 2 pieces of pineapple.  I had no idea what the other stuff was and I wasn't about to find out.  So, I ordered some eggs, bacon and brioche french toast from the kitchen.  Thank goodness the french toast was included in the buffet price because I got not 1, not 2, but 3 orders.  I'm not the type of person that over eats but I simply couldn't stop.  If I hadn't of felt my pants tightening around my stomach I probably would've gotten another order.    To sum my experience up, the buffet was a little pricey at $20 not including any drinks but the service was great and that french toast is palette blowing.  I will definitely be going back and next time I'll be wearing a dress or sweat pants.",

    "text": "Heard great things about the food at Bisto La Bon and that did impress! But with a large party our server seemed annoyed with us. Yes a large party is a lot of work so maybe they should have two servers take care of the table vs just one who was irritated the whole time. My bill alone was 90 dollars and tipped 20% after, because the food was amazing and the server was working hard to accommodate our large party. However after I left, I received a text that our party was added gratuity onto the total which I was never told while cashing out with my server which I feel like should be disclosed to the patron. (I was a waitress before and feel like it is customary to advise a group of people about gratuity being added onto the bill.) Definitely go for the food because the small plates were awesome, maybe not for the service or with a large party!",

For $35pp you get 10 amazing courses, bigger portions than I thought too. The chef is so creative and I think this is his play time. He puts together ingredients you wouldn't think to but they turn out amazing.  I know the first two and last two plates, but I'm a little uncertain on the order in between.  1. Watermelon gazpacho that was unexpectedly (and delightfully) a little spicy 2. Fresh buffalo mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes, micro basil, and 12 yr balsamic 3. Goat cheese stuffed peppadew peppers with carmalized onions and a ginger honey sauce - this was a favorite 4. Seared scallop over mashed potatoes with demi glaze- dining partner said scallop was perfectly cooked. 5. Crispy avocado and asparagus with sweet chili sauce- another favorite 6. Salmon- don't remember much about it, I don't like seafood 7. Sweedish meatball and potatoes with ligonberry 8. Some kind of cream cheese whipped cream with ouzi? fruit- really good and very different 9. The most amazing cheese plate with a brie type cheese and apricot marmalade that went perfect together 10. Chocolate flourless cake with mango sorbet  The food was just to die for, but also the anticipation of what was coming next was really exciting. I can't wait to go back. It's different every week.",

    "text": "First time here, had to check out the \"famous\" brunch due to all the great reviews. Many times it simply doesn't pan out. But thankfully, it did this time!   First off, we recently moved from Las Vegas (aka Lost Wages!), the epicenter of the best buffets in the known galaxy (well, maybe the one on planet Zorton is better?)...The best buffet of all time, hands down, without question, is the one at the Bellagio. And tourists all over the world agree.  Ok, now that I've said that, I need to put this \"buffet\" in perspective. First off, this is Charlotte, not Vegas. And the restaurant isn't located in a multi-billion dollar casino property. But TASTE wise, this buffet was EXCELLENT! Not a huge selection, but then again, the space is small, so they really do the best that they can.  First off, let me start with one of THE most simple dishes that most EVERYONE screws up: scrambled eggs. Yes, the dreaded scrambled eggs. Most places, ESPECIALLY at a buffet, serve them hard and stiff.......maybe they're trying to find a replacement for Depleted Uranium??? I digress....but at BLB, their eggs were SOFT scrambled, creamy without being runny, and oh so delicious with a little salt and pepper. Now they do make these to order, mind you, so they're not sitting (and cooking) in a steam sauna. But they were perfect the both times we ordered them (yes, I ordered two helpings)! And yes, they come with God's perfect creation: BACON! (Cudda been a little crispier, but hey, I have to nitpick something!)  The other two things you have to ask for that is made it order are 1) French Toast and 2) Chocolate covered chocolate waffles. Both were yummy.   The buffet had something that flipped my lid: slow stewed beef brisket! When I looked at it, I saw large chunks of brisket, and thought....hum, that looks dry and tasteless. Man did I ever judge that book by its cover. When I had it, it melted IN MY MOUTH! In fact, that brisket is as good as any specialty BBQ place in town, minus the Tx style smoke. But it was DELICIOUS!  Then I had the Swedish Meatballs, and they had the requisite tangy sweet sauce on them. Yummy. I saw the potato salad and thought the same (and silly) thing I did when I saw the brisket.....nah, just ordinary potato salad. Again, DOAH! WRONG! They were INCREDIBLE. In fact, the Exec Chef came out and I asked him, what the heck was in there that made it SO good? He said, \"I can't tell you that! You wouldn't come in anymore!\" OK, so I HAD to try.  They also had a yummy kielbasa and cabbage, a housemade Mozzarella roll with tomato and basil, grits with asiago cheese, and of course they had various veggies, salad and fresh fruit. Now being a meat-a-tarian, I RARELY go for the latter, but I did sample some of what my wife had, and they were all fresh and delicious.  The Coconut Macaroons were AWESOME! After we both stuffed our faces (and bellies) silly, I took 2 of these tasty morsels out the door and ate them in the car. Man were they ever good!  All I can say is THAT WAS SOME GOOD EATS! We cannot wait to get back here for dinner. At $18 a person, with $3 Mimosas, this was a great deal! HIGHLY recommend BLB!",

Bistro La Bon hands down has the best french toast I've ever had.    I have not been for dinner, but if the food for dinner is anything like the food for brunch, I know I won't be disappointed.   Also, the restaurant has such a cool vibe and if you sit in the back, you have a beautiful view of downtown.  My one piece of advise, if you go for brunch try to make a reservation and ask for one of the tables with a view.",

The smoked salmon omelette i had was cooked perfectly, had the texture of a cloud, and was complemented by delicious little mini-rosti's. just heaven. service was great and the space/atmosphere is awesome. i literally sat there marveling at how great it was, chew by chew.

    "text": "I visited Bistro La Bon on 01/13/19 for the Sunday Brunch Buffet.  First, there appeared to be a wandering homeless man that came in immediately after me and started to ask the guests questions (assuming for money or food); however, when I brought this to the host attention before being seated, he acted nonchalant.  Second and when seated, I asked my server how much the buffet was for my daughter, who is 12, and she stated $22.  I found that odd since the website advertises $11 for Kids under 12.  Perhaps she assumed my daughter was older, but never inquired her age.  Third and moving on to the food..we ordered French Toast, Bacon, & Eggs w/ cheese for our 'five' selections in addition to the buffet.  The bacon had a weird after taste to me, and the French toast was crunchy..assuming from the sourdough bread. Not my favorite part of the meal.  As for the buffet, I was in love with the brisket until I found a string of HAIR being chewed in my mouth along with the meat! I was over it at this point. The server took my plate and I was comped my meal.  They replaced the brisket in the buffet, but I still found the overall experience disappointing.  I also felt that they should have comped my daughter's meal as well.  Either way, I recognize it wasn't the server's fault, but it didn't seem to be a big deal to her.  Long story short, it was not the best experience and I won't be in a hurry to visit their establishment for brunch any time soon.",

They only had the Queen's Feast menu and not their normal menu which was a good way to try their best stuff. The earliest reservation was for 8:45pm which was weird since the restaurant had plenty of tables open when we got there. Maybe they didn't have enough servers? I could tell that our server was particularly stressed since he was pretty much MIA most of the night and rolled his eyes when we asked for spoons to eat our soup. So I think they were short staffed. We tried to order different things to sample as much as we could so here is what we ordered:  First course - kale salad, beet salad, tomato basil soup  Second course - mussels, grilled octopus, lobster arancini  Third course - lavender chicken, Scottish salmon, pan seared scallops with creamy polenta ($6 supplement)  Fourth course - bread pudding and chocolate truffle  I would order the bread pudding every single time and the chicken with banana bread. Seriously these two things were some of the best dishes I've had in Charlotte so far.",

I was provided to drink menu and decided to try their blanc drink. It was very light and not too sweet. As the rest of my party arrived we transitioned to the table or dinning area smoothly. I had the shrimp churro as an appetizer which was wonderful. I sampled a bit of the Brussels sprouts which were seasoned well. Then  I had the surf and turf as my entree. The texture quality and taste were really good. For dessert I had the espresso cream Brulee. The cream brulee did not  have a nice crisp top. The espresso didn't mix right with this dish it was very overbearing.  I did not quite enjoy the desserts. I was able to sample the other desserts that people at my table ordered. The bread pudding was more like a cake texture and wasn't as soft, but crunchier.  The plate that it was served on was very large. The chocolate cake was okay. The presentation was great and the manager walked around brining out dishes and asking how everything was going. I think it's a great place to go to and I probably return.",

And what a great selection to choose from. The fried avocado and asparagus was unbelievable. The wonton wrapping was perfectly fried and delicate, and the chili sauce was the perfect compliment.   It was a hard decision, but I went with the Swedish meatballs for my main course - another great choice I've made in my long life!  Perfectly cooked, and the lingonberry sauce on top was not too overpowering.   The blackberry swirl cheesecake was a great ending to a great meal. And Oreo crust was a good compliment to the cheesecake filling and chocolate mousse.   On top of all the great food, Wednesday's are half off signature cocktails so of course I indulged in a watermelon mojito - a very refreshing choice that is even better with all this humidity we've had lately.",

Especially since it takes 2-3 to fill up. Save your money and go somewhere else. Cost us $130 for 5 of us and we all drank water",

While the french toast was nice and thick, the sweetness of the french toast and the coffee was a little much combined. There was also no powdered sugar on the french toast, which was a little disappointing.   My friend ordered a plate with english muffins, eggs, potatoes, and onions and it was delicious! I would definitely order that if I come back.",

Cool tables and chairs, great seating at the bar, even great lighting, and very very friendly staff.   Food - we ordered 5 small plates and it was a lot for 2 people, maybe a little too much, but worth it!  Lobster mac and cheese is absolutely essential. We loved everything... gnocchi, brussel sprouts, shrimp and chorizo, meatballs, all were cooked perfectly, and food came out relatively quickly. As we watched other tables receive their food, we had a little order envy because every dish really did look amazing.   I am only disappointed that we waited so long to visit this fun, unique, unpretentious restaurant. It is an excellent dining experience, and a terrific addition to the Elizabeth / Midwood rotation.",

Small plates are the emphasis and the chef is not afraid to throw in unexpected flavors. Had a veggie polenta with very crisp fresh veggies including fennel. A seafood saffron rice dish (served in a hot metal pan) had plenty of seafood and flavor. The desserts were super incentive and tasty. I had a passion fruit flan like dish that had coconut ice cream and basil ice cream on the side. My wife had a flourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse on top and homemade vanilla ice cream on the side. This place is a great pick if you want to get away from the corporate feel of many charlotte restaurants.",

We arrived at Bistro la bon around 10:30 am. I'm glad because we avoided the incoming rush of people. Everything about this place was great from the food, service and decor. The Sunday brunch buffet is $22 which is pricey but worth the money.  Our server Joshua was great at explaining the brunch experience. All the food is organic, farm to table, no preservatives. You can order eggs, bacon, eggs Benedict , French toast and chocolate waffles. They even made me an order of egg whites. All the food options were great. I hope they add turkey bacon or sausage to their menu. Although they do offer biscuits & gravy with turkey meat.   We had a group of five. The seating was chairs and a long bench. The seating was a little tight but we made it work. Even though I don't live on Charlotte anymore I would definitely return during another visit.",

    "text": "Still 5 stars through and through. I think this may be one of those places that's absolutely incredible but flies under the radar. We went here on a Monday night at 7pm for Restaurant Week, and I hadn't looked at the menu prior to coming here. Parking is, and always will be, a bit sketchy. Just deal with it, there's plenty of it :)  We were seated promptly, and given the menus. I love the decor of Bistro La Bon, it kind of reminds me (and don't take this the wrong way) of the Haunted Mansion a little bit? Every chandelier is different and the lampshades are kinda off kilter... anyway, it's very cool.   Anyway, enough boring stuff LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD. Which is perfect. First Course: Roasted Beet and Apple Salad. Diced and placed in a circle mold, and topped with goat cheese dollops, arugula, pistachios, and figs. I don't know if I had ever had beets before, but this was a really refreshing and light start. Second Course: Crispy Avocado & Asparagus. These were cool little spring rolls that had some nice fresh steamed (or blanched) ingredients inside. I also shared The Lady's Spanish Octopus which was really well cooked with a ratatouille (vegetable stew..ish...thing). Third Course (main): Lavender Chicken. This was the star of the night for me. The flavors were incredibly complex and I'm desperate to try to make this at home. Skin-on Chicken breast seasoned with thyme and lavender butter, sitting on top of a piece of banana bread, with a slightly spicy curry sauce that had walnuts and grapes sitting in it. You would NEVER think that this works, but I continued to have magical forkfuls. That's right. Magic.  Dessert: Bourbon Brioche Bread Pudding. Like a dense popover with a caramel sauce and some vanilla bean ice cream. Not a light way to end a meal, but certainly the right choice. Who gets a cheese plate for dessert... come on people.  Service was excellent. Food was brought out timely. Our reservations were honored. We had two glasses of wine by suggestion of our waitress that was excellent. For a nice dinner, this never disappoints.",

The dishes are thoughtful and creative and, well, amazingly good. Try it.   I must say, however, that I especially love Sunday brunch. It is beyond fancy yet somehow simple. The French toast, chocolate waffle as well as eggs/bacon are served to you at your table (order as much as you want) along with the lovely buffet (smoked salmon, capers, veggies, salad, fruit, to name a few). The French toast is probably the best French toast I have ever eaten. Really, it's that good.",

The dishes we tried worth mentioning are kale salad, mussels, crispy avocado and asparagus, lavender chicken (never knew chicken would taste this different and so delicious) Scottish Salmon and bread pudding (never had stuck a great bread pudding before). The ambience was good, make sure you ask for a seat near a window, has good views of uptown Charlotte. Will surely go back",

We were seated quickly, that's where the quickness ended. Our waiter didn't show up for a bit. When he came back the second time he took our drink order, wait again, then he took our food order, wait again. Food was meh. In fact, as I write this I can't recall anything except a rubbery English muffin from my eggs Benedict.  Insert wait again, hold it, hold it, finally he came back and we were able to ask for the bill. We thought he had quit because we didn't see him for about 20 minutes. Wait again to pay... Yikes. Moral of this story, this is somewhere you won't hate, but you definitely won't love. I would go back if I was invited by friends I don't know well enough to complain to.",

    "text": "We came here for a birthday lunch and it was a great choice. The neighborhood is a mixture of new and run-down. Bistro La Bon is newer and popular with the neighborhood. The inside is large with many different seating options. We were in the back in a more traditional area. Saturday brunch is a smaller menu which leans more towards breakfast than lunch. I was in a more lunch mood so I had fewer options. I had the market salad which changes basted on the market. The salad I had was fresh arugula, shaved fennel, cheese, and a poached egg. The veggies were tasty and the egg was poached perfectly. I thought the salad could have used more acid to cut the richness of the egg yolk. I also had their bloody Mary. If you like bloody Marys you must get one here. They bring your vodka in a glass with ice and you go to the bar and fix how you want it. They have several mixes and garnishes. The garnishes did not have labels so you may have to ask what something is or if it is spicy. It was fun and I enjoyed trying new things like pickled asparagus and sun dried tomatoes in my drink. My husband had the vegetable sandwich which was really good. They uses high quality cheese and made both of our dishes even better. Our party brought a cake from a local bakery and our server brought it out with candles. They sliced the cake for us and brought out fresh forks and cake slices. The service was good considering we were a group of six. If you are in the area I would give this place a try.",

It is overpriced and not really that good. The brie appetizer was good, but it is hard to mess up melted cheese. My parents ordered the frito misto and had soggy calamari on top of spaghetti sauce with olives.   For the main course, we had the saffron rice, filet, and lamb wellington. All were VERY undercooked. My mom ordered her lamb medium and it was purple on the inside. Granted you can eat very rare lamb, but it was so undercooked that it was really chewy and unappetizing. The rice didn't have all the liquid cooked off so it had kind of a starchy liquid mush in the bottom that was fish flavored. My dad's filet was also not served the medium rare that was ordered, it was chewy and raw.   My mom is convinced that restaurants have a \"B team\" on Mondays, maybe she is right. Either way, for those prices we will not be returning.",

Trying it out for their Saturday brunch, I experienced the following:  - inside was cold to the point that all the patrons were wearing their coats inside. - Ordered food and drinks at the same time, but the food arrived before the drinks. - When the food arrived, it was incorrect and left one dish to get cold while the other was being corrected. The dish that was left was not even \"complete\" according to the waiter.  - Seeing that my wife was pregnant, we ordered two Bloody Marys, one virgin and one not. Well guess who received the virgin and who received the one with alcohol? - Lastly, the food was not even that good. Examples were an omelet that could have passed as a salt lick and grits that were so under-cooked that they were hard.  The only saving grace was a pleasant waiter. It is just unfortunate that he was apparently short changed by the others players at the establishment.",

The food is decent, but not outstanding considering the price. I have tried dinner and brunch here. I would not recommend it for the later. The brunch menu is uninspired and the service was terrible. It took my friend and I twenty minutes to receive a menu and attention from the waiter. There were about five other groups in the restaurant   Dinner was a better experience. The atmosphere is good for a date night, but nothing about the menu stood out.   I do not anticipate returning.",

There is a random array of kielbasa, salads, potatoes, cheese grits etc....There are a ton of muffins and breads.  They do cook to order breakfast food which has options of eggs and bacon, french toast and waffles.  On to what I love....the cook to order french toast and waffles!  The waffles has a fresh whipped cream that is decadant.  The french toast is flavorful and moist.  But what i love the most....the MACAROONS!  I have been known to grab a few on the way out!  Tacky, I know, but I can't get enough!  If you are a drinker, $2 mimosas are tempting!  The brunch is $18 per person.  If you are hungry and are interested in a an all-you-can eat brunch in Plaza Midwood, this is the spot!",

Passion fruit is my favorite flavor in the world so I love a place that uses it in savory and sweet dishes. The beet salad is divine. I order anything Swedish on the menu. Everything I've tried has been great - from fish at brunch to meatballs with lingonberry sauce and Jason's Temptation (with anchovies).  The desserts are all fantastic. I hate bread pudding but I would order it every time. It's amazing. Caramel sauce. AWESOME.   Love this place.",

    "text": "Can't believe it's taken me this long to check out Bistro La Bon for brunch. I remember see this place come to the odd strip mall and thought it would never amount to nothing. I am pleasantly and utterly incorrect. Bistro La Bon is a culinary force to be reckoned with and has earned every bit of my palate's attention.   First of all, these guys are making their own bread every day. For everything. making baguettes and brioche isn't easy to do when you have a shining menu to go along with it. It's labor intensive and has to be done right. Happy to say these guys deliver hand over fist with flavor.   Love the decor, too. It's not to stuffy like some other French restaurants. It's small-ish, but the bar can seat quite a few people. Also, the waiting area is ridiculously comfortable. Try not to fall asleep here on a Sunday afternoon. Or do.   Brunch is just amazing. Swedish meatballs, brisket, au gratin potatoes, salad, plenty of bread, chocolate waffles, eggs, bacon, and..... dun dun dun....the best freaking brioche french toast I've ever had in my entire life. This french toast is perfect. Simply perfect. Not overtly sweet. Just enough sweet/fermenty taste of brioche, modest amount of syrup, homemade whipped cream. It's grilled on the flat top with just the right amount of charred bits. Goodness. Save room for these as they can be ordered from your server. Get ready to eat a baker's dozen.   The service is fantastic. Knowledgeable and friendly. All you need.   For $18 a head, I have to say this rivals brunch from many other places in town. I've heard it can be hard to get a seat at peak brunching hours. We made it in at 130pm and didn't have a problem.   I can't wait to go back.",

But you can limit how much you're screwing your customer to where they don't leave profoundly unsatisfied. See: Good Food on Montford, Duckworth's Cellar.  The food at Bistro is Good. That's it. There's nothing crazy unique. It's all very standard fare with a french twist at best. Everything came out hot. Our server was actually really excellent (I wish I remembered her name!). She's the sole reason for 2 stars over one.  But the pricing here is spit-in-your-face insulting. $18 for half of a Octopus tentacle and one and a half creamer potatoes? That is not an exaggeration. Cocktails are $13-$16, but unlike Bistro's competitors they're sold in half-height tumblers. Why bother having the bartender make the damn things if you get 4 sips of liquid after all the ice?  We were castoffs from the aggressively unfriendly seating and chaos of Soul across the street. Bistro must survive on the dozens of people who aren't seated there an hour after their reservation. I know I won't make the mistake of migrating here again.",

    "text": "So we don't get to Charlotte often, and I asked a few friends what they would recommend as a restaurant there, since we were going to IKEA and wanted to have something nice before heading home.  I looked around on Yelp as well, and found that there was one place that everyone seemed to agree was good.  We found the place, a little off the beaten track in an area that seems to be undergoing some, gentrification, let's say.  In a grocery store parking lot next to a 5 Guys burgers.  Once inside, this place immediately transported us to Paris.  A rustic chic, comfortable and quiet, with little nooks for the individual sections.  Our waiter, Trip (he asked that we mention him by name, and I'm more than willing to do so, because he rocked ;)) seated us by the window, and immediately made us feel comfortable and welcome.  We decided to make the best of the menu and worked our way through the small plates, sharing each one. We started off with what would turn out to be the best plate of the evening, a warm and delightful Frito Misto, with a combination of perfectly deep fried calamari and shrimp, tossed in a savoury tapenade of nicoise olives, tomatoes and banana peppers, simply heavenly.  We continued on our culinary journey with a wonderful bite of Lavender Chicken, then on to the Seared Scallops.  Delightful, the hazelnut crumb was the perfect bit of texture for the sweet bits of seafood.  The next item on the seafood side of this was the Shrimp and Chorizo.  I don't like chorizo, well, I didn't like chorizo.  What I was expecting, when I ordered it more to please my spouse, who enjoys the spicy, greasy stuff, was exactly that.  What I got instead, was delicately sliced and just enough to send a spicy flair through the creamy sauce that provided the base for beautifully prepared shrimp.  Melt in the mouth..as Manu would say.  (You'd have to be a fan of Aussie TV to get that one)  By the time the Pan Seared Gnocchi arrived, I was already getting a bit full to appreciate the rather heavy dish, but the flavours were spot on, and the hubby certainly dug in.  The only dish that I regret ordering, was the Butternut Squash Lasagna, it lacked salt and the love in preparation that was evident in the rest of the savoury dishes.  Now, we couldn't very well leave without dessert, so we chose what our waiter, the ever attentive and knowledgeable Trip, suggested, the Brioche Bourbon Bread Pudding.  Bread pudding, in my experience is often the result of leftovers from last week's table bread.  Bread pudding in this instance, was light, creamy and a joy to taste, the homemade vanilla ice cream (complete with little black flecks of vanilla bean) the bourbon soaked raisins, and ooooh yes, that completely heavenly caramel sauce, liftingt to heights never before reached by the simple bread pudding.  So, all in all, a big high 5 and thumbs up to both Bistro La Bon, and the awesome Trip! We'll be back the next time we want to spend money at IKEA..soon..yup ;)  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyourfoodieguru.wordpress.com%2F&s=9197756d757124521e9dce00ee2e31d0c3124afea3be33e86f79d1e6806d4c25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yourfoodieguru.wordpress...</a>",

Just not something that most of us could afford but maybe once or twice a year. For two people, you will get out of there for about $55 once you include tax/tip, which is a very expensive breakfast. But still... it really was delicious!  I really liked that they had plenty of savory options. I'm not a big pancake/waffle/pastry person, so their scalloped potatoes, brisket, cheese grits, jalapeno mac n cheese, etc was right up my alley. Their cous cous was so unique and I loved it! Also good fruit/veggie options, and the sweet/dessert options were like something out of a fancy French bakery-- not at all the typical frozen/thawed pastry you would see on most buffets. Loved it.",

The star of the show was the bread pudding with bourbon caramel and current sauce. Light and rich, crispy and soft.",

As an out-of-towner and total foodie, I thought I might have landed on something amazing. The pictures looked great, there were rave reviews, should've been an easy win!  I ordered the french toast - but, it was a bit burnt on the edges. Not like caramelized burnt, just burnt. And, nothing really special about it to be honest. However, the bacon was phenomenal.   I wouldn't recommend the french toast nor order it again. Next time I would order probably a classic breakfast (the people next to me had this and it looked awesome). Friendly staff and nice looking place, but waiting to be wowed by the food.",

You can enjoy small plates or order a full entree, they'll even split the entree as a small plate.  The wine list is great, the atmosphere upscale but far from stuffy. Would I suggest it to a friend, only if I value their friendship :-)",

Atmosphere: curtains, home style rugs, big welcoming seating areas, and relaxed lighting soften the dark woods that wrap you up. It's a restaurant that doesn't feel like table turnaround is the priority.   Waitstaff/ Open kitchen/ Staff: everyone was engaging. It was refreshing to experience a staff that seemed genuinely driven to make sure you were taken care of during your visit.  Wine list: basic, well thought out & easily paired with the menu. I ordered a bottle that our server Javier recommend.  Menu: farm to table meets omg. My daughter and I decided to order a few small plates to try out the menu. Our waiter Javier was knowledgeable and friendly.  Appetizer: Manchego & Spanish Serrano Ham.  Shared Plates: Crispy Avacado & Asparagus, Pan Seared Potato Gnocchi, and Frito Misto. Dessert: this ridiculous bread pudding.   Photos & Thoughts: Sorry, we were busy eating with our eyes & bellies. But the plates are served well thought out & there wasn't a bite we took that didn't melt in our mouths. None of the flavor a were overwhelming. It was just painfully good! Like, we ate so much it hurt like a Thanksgiving dinner at your grandmas house.",

It's located on the corner of a shopping center off Central Ave. there is a big bright white sign with black letters-- you can't miss it. As you walk up, you get a good idea about the decor of the establishment, it's cute and chic.   Upon our arrival, a sever asked that we be seated in his section- and he was a pretty awesome server. He provided us with just the right amount of attention. The service was both prompt and courteous.   In regards to the food I enjoyed it, although it was not exceptionally memorable. I had the spinach and caramelized  onion Benedict. My friend had the fresh biscuit and turkey with gravy. We also enjoyed the $3.00 mimosas- yes that is correct $3.00!!!  This place is a winner in my book because the service is too notch, prices are good? Ambiance is adorable, and the food is decent!",

I went with a big group of girls for a \"Queen's Feast\" event, so it might not have been a typical night at this highly raved Bistro, but I now know what the fuss is about.  First of all, I absolutely loved the ambience.  It was the epitome of \"Rustic Chic\"...if there is such a thing?  Despite its French name, the restaurant's menu seemed internationally eclectic, with several Spanish and Italian-inspired creation, as well as American...using fresh, locally sourced meats (AKA \"farm-to-table\").  I liked the cool blend of upscaled, tapa-style dishes and cozy, warm decor.  For my \"Feast\", I chose the Shrimp & Chorizo as the appetizer, Filet Oscar as the main dish, then the Sorbet as the dessert.  The Shrimp & Chorizo was really good, but I regret not going with the Pan Seared Gnocchi (possibly even better?).  As for my main dish, the All-Natural Filet Oscar, with lump Crab Cake and Mashed Potatoes, it felt a bit short to my liking.  I asked for a Medium Rare, but mine was served VERY Rare.  Though super-juicy, it was a tad too bloody for me (TOO \"Farm to Table\" lol).  I also thought the Mashed Potatoes were a bit too bland.  For me, the lump Crab Cakes and the grilled Asparagus were the best parts of the dish.  Also, the beautiful, edible flower (yes, one of the girls asked if they were edible) was a great accent, making the dish extra-photogenic!  Then the fresh, tri-colored Sorbet...a perfect way to cap off the big feast.  Although I wasn't overly thrilled with the main dish (for the reasons given above), I was impressed with the various beautifully prepared dishes/tapas enjoyed by others...and I noticed several items I'd love to try on their menu as well.  And OH...I forgot the best part of the feast was my \"Rose Sangria\", possibly the best Sangria I've had here in Charlotte!  Despite a few pitfalls in my main dish, Bistro La Bon lived up to my expectations (eclectic, sophisticated menu with artistically prepared dishes)...and in some ways, even exceeding it (ambience/decor).  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this highly anticipated dining experience, and will most definitely return!",

My mother and i made reservations for this place yesterday morning to have a little brunch. She had the shrimp and grits which she mentioned she wished it was a bigger portion size other than that she liked them, i had the salmon omelette with a mimosa, my omelette also came with a side of potatoes, and of coarse you know you cant go wrong with a mimosa i don't even think its possible. Rustic, is how i would describe this place of business. I enjoyed looking at some of the artwork and paintings on the walls here. Our waiter was awesome although he mentioned he was new and from Atlanta you could tell he was a little nervous but he did a great job at making sure we had a great first time experience here.",

For Plaza Midwood, it feels like a random location I'm a strip mall, but the decoration and inside feel really classy and posh. The strip mall thing is nice too because there's plenty of parking.  Brunch is awesome! $22 for really delicious food on a buffet and made-to-order bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, waffles, and french toast. $3 mimosas and bellinis, and $5 bloody marys. I thought the price was really fair for what we got.   We got seated pretty quickly, and the service was really awesome. We loved the french toast and the chocolate waffle. The eggs Benedict and bacon were also really good. We tried these things all from the kitchen. We also loved the fresh fruit, sausage and cabbage, and beef brisket.   It's a great place to try brunch in Charlotte! I'll definitely be back!",

I wasn't sure what to expect to be honest as it is at the end of a strip mall, but I was pleasantly surprised by the vibe and ambiance of this place. Our waiter was awesome and very attentive making sure my beer gals was never empty which is a huge plus in my book.   Ordered the beef carpaccio - to be honest wasn't a huge fan of the aioli/mayo they put on the dish, but it was probably my fault of not specifying I hated mayo to the waiter. Ordered the paella which was full of sea creatures - lobster, squid, shrimp, etc. It wasn't the best paella I've ever had, but the lobster was cooked perfectly which made up for the slightly undercooked rice. The dessert was fabulous, a coffee brulee.  I will definitely be back to try their famous brunch sometime in the near future.",

The location is a little \"meh\" (it's in a strip mall) HOWEVER the inside is beeeaautiFULL and the service is great; food is delightful. Hubby and I had the crispy Brussels and goat cheese poms for an appetizer. The sauce on the Brussels was a little sweet for that pairing....kind of like a hollandaise sauce. Hubby loved it though!! So one thumb up there. We both agreed the goat poms were ridiculous. So simple and so yummy!! The balsamic reduction was perfection. Scottish salmon and NC trout for dinner. Lovely presentation and very good. My salmon was cooked incredibly. Crispy and well seasoned on outside; melt-in-your-mouth on inside. Yum. Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake and what I believe was a blood orange sorbet. It was good.",

The bread is soft and fresh and the added whipped cream is delicious without being too heavy.   The French toast doesn't come with any sides though and if you want bacon and eggs you're quickly looking at a $21 meal, which is pretty high in my opinion for one slice of French toast, two eggs and a plate of bacon.   The mimosas aren't anything to rave about, but definitely a good addition to the brunch.   I'll continue to frequent this place for brunch but will probably have to make the hard choice between eggs and bacon every time!",

I had planned on ordering off their standard menu, but brunch was the only option on Sunday. The ambiance was beautiful- a really cute spot! The buffet was excellent- by far the best Swedish meatballs I have ever had. The eggs Benedict and french toast were also exceptional. The only thing stopping me from giving them a 5 star rating would be the beverages. The mimosas were $3 and they tasted like it too- would not recommend. I like a sweet, flavourful mimosa and it was dry and bland. The coffee was just awful. It tasted like it had been sitting in the pot all day. I asked for a new cup hoping that would be fresher but it wasn't.   I definitely would go again for the food, but the beverages were disappointing.",

She said it was good and I was open to trying something new!  And when I tell you everything was delish, EVERYTHING WAS DELISH!!! Oh my goodness this is a great place for a vegetarian to visit!! This is my new spot to go for a yummy drink and great appetizers!! We ordered the Vegetarian Lasagna, Brussel Sprouts and Mussels with a Watermelon mojitos!! This drink was so chic and gorgeous with the watermelon wedge on the side, I couldn't wait to taste it and it was amazing!!  The food was wonderful as well, my favorite out of the three that we ordered was the Brussel sprouts, it had this sauce, that was out of this world!! It was so delicious I would go back just for the Brussel Sprouts! Secondly, would be the Mussels, which had french fries on top! The sauce under the mussels was mouth-watering as well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not too overpowering, just the right kick! Thirdly, of course the Lasagna, but only because I had to place it somewhere not because I didn't enjoy it. If I had taken a picture of my plate after I finished, it would be shameful how I cleaned that plate!  The service was good, the vibes from the bartender was a little off but overall everything was excellent! I can not wait to go back. I'll be planning a Ladies Night soon:)",

We made a reservation for 8p this time and we were seated right away, so nice we didn't have to wait 30 min like last time.   App:  Cucumber avocado soup- creamy and surprisingly layered with flavor. The cucumber his you right away followed by the creaminess of the avocado. Awesome job.  Beet salad- I love how this salad has evolved over time. There are so many new elements like the dried figs and apples. I was also glad to see a beautiful long line of goat cheese... Yummy!   2nd course:  Mussels- my fav of course! I wasn't too happy about a few of my mussels not opening but, oh well..still tasted amazing! Love that leek saffron broth, very flavorful.  Brie Brulee- the bad loves this one. The chutney was a little too sweet again, I recommend spicing it up..  Entree:  Swedish meatballs- I loved how all the flavors came together in such a balanced dish. The meatballs were succulent, the mashed potatoes were creamy, the gravy had an earthy spice, and the lingonberry jam was a little sweeter than cranberry sauce. Very reminiscent of Thanksgiving! Lavender chicken- boneless! Chicken was cooked very well but I wish there was more curry sauce...  Dessert: We were so stuffed we split a dessert and took one home. The famous bread pudding.. Also an evolving dish the added crumble was a nice texture. Wish they had given a little more vanilla bean ice cream.. Wasn't enough for the bread pudding size. Caramel is my favorite on this plate.    Always a pleasure here!",

Before even walking through the door, the aroma of bacon, eggs and other goodies hit me and I knew I had made the right decision to dine here. This is a smaller establishment so reservations would probably be good and you will see a variety of people there being Plaza Midwood and all. Not being too impressed by the brunch options in Charlotte I was hoping they wouldn't let me down and they didn't, not even in the slightest way.   They have a wonderful selection of brunch goodies such as the standard eggs, bacon and pastries but also some other random bites like swedish meatballs, pot roast, pasta salad (with a kick!),homemade mozzarella with tomato and basil and more. Unlike some other establishments, the selection isn't overwhelming which is a nice change of pace since I like to go to the buffet line with a plan of attack. Along with the buffet you can order their chocolate waffles, which were fantastic but too savory to eat on my own or their french toast----this was my favorite. It was in a pool of syrup and melted in my mouth, I like that. My only complaint was that the sweet potatoes and au gratin potatoes seemed a little under cooked and being a carboholic, that brought me down.  Save room for the pastries such as their Girl Scout Samoa cookie like macaroons (one may have magically slipped in a napkin for enjoyment later) or pumpkin muffins. They also had $4 Bloody Mary's and $3 Mimosas so start your Sunday morning....ehh...afternoon right and check this place out.",

I ordered the Breakfast Burger and it was delicious! I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and we had a wonderful waiter, Jake. Unfortunately, it took 45 minutes to get our food. While Jake was an awesome waiter he forgot about different things that we asked for because he was so busy with tables. It took another 15 minutes to get our check and 15 for him to pick up our check for us to pay. We went on our lunch break and this caused us to be late. If I had known that it would take that long to get food I would've went another day. The food was great...4 stars for the delays.",

The atmosphere was nice , music was a great mix and there was a good crowd. Our waitress Alivia ( I'm probably spelling it wrong), was an absolute joy! My fiance has many dietary restrictions and she took the time to suggest some alternative solutions to what they had on the menu for him. Needless to say everything she suggested for him and myself was excellent! The chef went out of his way to prepare something delicious that we both could enjoy! We were sure to let the manager know how much we appreciated the service we received here! We will definitely be back!",

We came back and had a generally much better experience. Service still seemed a little goofy, but much of that could have been our server feeding off our own vibe. We were all pretty severely hungover, a little out of it ourselves and craving hair of the dog so no points deducted there as our service pretty much matched our disposition. The food was definitely the star, and I am very pleased to have returned. Get the Pyttipanna if you 1) are here for brunch, and 2) eat meat. It was everything I could have hoped for. Thank you.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to eat at night! This appeared to be a very busy Charlotte Restaurant Week for them, but they were able to seat us at the specific table we requested a few minutes ahead of our reservation time.   My husband and I both had tomato bisque for Course 1, which was delicious. For Course 2 I had the fried brussel sprouts & my husband tried the brie brulee ... both were excellent.   For Course 3 I had my usual Creekside Farms filet with demiglaze served with mashed potatoes, roasted onion, and a roasted pear slice. The filet was the perfectly cooked medium that I requested, and super tender. The portions on the filet and pear were a bit smaller than when eating off the regular menu, which was fine as the first two courses were very generously portioned. My husband's Course 3 was his favorite Swedish Meatballs from the regular menu, and I think he would have licked the plate if there hadn't been a friend sitting at the next table.   Course 3 was the flourless chocolate truffle cake with a small scoop of in-house ice cream. That night the standard ice cream pairing with this selection was a coconut sorbet, but I subbed out for basil ice cream at no additional charge ... a slightly stronger batch than usual, but it worked really well with the richness of the cake. Hubby had his favorite bourbon brioche bread pudding with caramel sauce and homemade vanilla ice cream, topped with something that looked like raisins but tasted more like roasted blueberries. I got to enjoy the last two bites of that ... yum!!  Our server was very friendly and clearly knowledgeable about the menu. Food service was a bit slower than usual due to the crowd, but that was fine because we got more food than usual and it was nice to have a few minutes for each course to settle a bit. Usually the manager comes by to check on us, but that didn't happen this visit ... again OK and understandable, as the bar area was quite busy when we left.  First timers need to be aware that lunch/brunch is a different menu, which is OK but not nearly as good as the evening menu.",

The food was great (grilled octopus, scallops, bread pudding, to highlight a few), and the waiter was trying really hard to add to the experience. Sometimes more successfully than others. My boyfriend upgraded to the filet, and really liked it, but it wasn't exactly a man-sized-appetite portion for the extra $$. Also, he said it wasn't as good as Del Friscos. Which was pretty easy to counter with \"well, steak is their specialty\"...so I would caution you to manage your expectations. We saw friends there who said the chicken was phenomenal. Maybe try that.  Atmosphere is a good for a date or small group. A large group (8+) would consume the place and raise the noise level, possibly ruining the experience for others.   The brunch is outstanding and probably the best in the city (way better than that crap Nan & Byron's tries to pass off as upscale). Absolutely worth the price.",

    "text": "I booked reservations through Yelp for a Thursday night birthday dinner with Mike N (after he raved about this place during the Yelp Elite event).  Unfortunately, he got stuck at work, so I kept pushing the reservation - and finally ended up calling in that we'd be late and they were very cool with it.  We arrived and there were only a few other parties there - which I guess is they the reservation was so easy to move around.  I was right away impressed with the decor - especially since its in a strip mall.  Its very cool, intimate, and funky.  We sat down and chose our drinks - I went with a toddy (which is served cold) and Mike N went with the Blood Orange Manhattan.  If I could choose again, I'd totally get the Manhattan.  The orange foam on top is delicious.  I could drink that all day long.  The arduous task of deciding which small plates to order was next.  Luckily, Mike N had tasted almost everything at the Yelp event so he recommended the short ribs, the bouillabaisse and the grilled cheese.  We added spicy shrimp & chorizo and called that a good starting point.  Out of all of those, the jamon iberico grilled cheese was absolutely my favorite.  I almost thought about ordering another one.  We used all of our bread in the bouillabaisse because that was so good.    The evening ended with a passionfruit desert and ice cream.  I loved the passonfruit - but wasn't a huge fan of the flavors of ice cream (pumpkin and coconut).  I'm stoked to go back and try brunch, and more foods!",

    "text": "Had not been here in a while to eat.  We came after work to check it out.  They've completely changed the bar area and there is no longer a TV.  I think I liked it the other way better, but this way gives much more open space and bar area seating including the bar itself, plenty of high-tops and lounge seating - overall a winning combination.  They also play some chill music, which I like.  There is patio/outdoor dining as well as it is very comfortable and spacious, although seating is limited.  We sat at the bar to have some appetizers and the bartender/server for us was Kevin. He is a new bartender, but he was very personable, helpful and informative but still allowed us our privacy.  We had the Calamari with a smoky, chunky tomato sauce.  It was very good with sun-dried tomatoes reduced to provide a nice toothsome sauce with a slight sweetness from the tomatoes!  Calamari with rings and tentacles - crispy and perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all.  We also had the seared gnocchi with parmesan pepper sauce...slightly salty to me, but absolutely delicious with chunks of artichoke that were cooked well so you didn't have any hard parts.  We finished our appetizer selection with the scallops.  Two seared scallops (a little under to my taste) and a dollop of delicious pureed potato with a brown sauce.  Very, very good.  We ended the evening with the Brioche Bread Pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  I think this is the best bread pudding in town.  The chef, Majhid (not sure if I'm spelling this right and I didn't get his last name) came to check on us and he was very friendly and interested in our feedback.  Reasonable pricing for Charlotte.  Not crazy like some places.  They have a Saturday brunch which is more traditional fare and the Sunday brunch which is more of a European-style brunch with cheeses, meatballs and other assorted goodies.  I think they've made some great updates here and I look forward to going back soon!",

    "text": "Pros: Nice brunch spot Strong mimosas for $3  Fresh buffet options  Cons: Limited protein options Slow service Food was just OK  No reservations Sunday   My friends and I went here on a Sunday afternoon looking for the cure to our hangovers. Upon walking in, there were plenty of empty tables since it was 1:30pm and they close at 2:30pm. We asked the hostess for a table of 3. She said give her 5 min but we ended up waiting for 15min so that one person could come out and clean a specific table, despite the many that were already open. That didn't really sit well with us...but once we were seated, we went straight to the buffet. The prices Pp are $22 on Sunday for unlimited brunch buffet. And I must say, the options are pretty solid for that price. There was smoked salmon lox, beef brisket, kielbasa and cabbage, cheese grits, mac and cheese, scalloped potatoes, biscuits and gravy, Swedish meatballs, a small salad and fruit bar, and a smorgasbord of desserts/pastries. In addition to the buffet options you can also order unlimited eggs, bacon, and French toast.   I found the French toast made to order to be the best dish! The eggs were too runny and the bacon was soggy. The bread pudding from the pastry bar was also delicious. I wasn't too impressed with the flavors in other dishes, or the protein options. I guess I was expecting and omelette station or some type of chicken...I found the buffet to hold a little too many carbs!!!   I would probably come back here for brunch, but not without exploring other options in Charlotte first.",

Misto Frito- good breading, sauce to salty (maybe the olives) and quickly turned to mushy food in the sauce. Jamon & truffle grilled cheese had a great crunchy (non greasy) bread. But was lacking jamon flavor, it comes from the the thinly sliced shank.  They need to add another slice to the sandwich. Everything was good, but the mussels sauce was the bomb diggity!  2 best I've ever had!!  Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch!!  I'm sure the quality of food will be good for a buffet.",

However there's this strange mustard-mayo combo that we weren't fans of, just made the dish messy.   The shrimp couscous  (probably spelled that wrong)  was delicious too, however they said the sausage was chorizo but it didn't taste too much like it in my opinion.  Also you gotta get the jalapeno basil martini.    All in all, this place was the right dark restaurant I wanted to be in after a long 60 hour workweek.   I'll definitely be back.",

Our server apologized, and said the next round would be compensated, which we thought was fine.  Our food began arriving way before drinks, and was delicious. We enjoyed everything.  With our next drink order, they offered to comp one of our small plates. Then they took off a $6 app, which wasn't really a great apology for taking an hour to make four drinks.  Later the waiter knocked a glass of water in my lap. (Since I'd only gotten the one glass of water and no refills, there wasn't much, but my lap was soaked!)  We enjoyed much of the evening, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon.",

    "text": "OK, so can I make the oh so cliche yelper remark?  I SO wanted to love this place given the previous reviews.  However, my experience was mediocre on every level.  A friend and I decided to try the Sunday brunch buffet which is a $20 flat fee but it does exclude any drinks (i.e. coffee, soda, etc.).  We walked in and no one was at the hostess stand, not the worst thing that could happen but after standing around for a minute we just walked to the dining room where someone finally popped out.  After being seated a woman walked over and without saying a WORD poured water into our glasses.  It was so odd that I actually asked her how her day was going.  She said good, and then walked away.  We were clueless if this was our server?  We waited for several more minutes and then I flagged down the waiter working at the table next to us and asked if he could get our server.  Well, here comes back Miss No Personality and she literally says, \"Did you need something?\"  We were dumbfounded.  I explained that we had never been there before and we had no idea how to order food/drinks.  So she replies, \"Yeah, if you want something just tell me.\"  Ok, then.    The brioche French toast (you have to order this but it is included) was delicious.  The scrambled eggs were too soft for me and the \"crispy bacon\" that came with it was far from crispy - more like chewy.  I did love the array of fresh fruit on the bar along with a mixed green salad with some unique dressings like ginger balsamic (tasted great).  They offered some meats like chicken, and brisket but I found both to be sitting in a pool of grease.  I also didn't care for the Swedish meatballs - weren't awful but lacked flavor.  The pastries were good.  I would recommend the coconut macaroon - rich and delicious.    For $20, I'd be more apt to recommend Mimosa Grill, which for $20 also includes unlimited soda/tea/coffee.",

As I was deciding on a place to take my sister for restaurant week I just really didn't want to be disappointed and though I would have liked to try somewhere new I just had a feeling that Bistro La Bon would be the place to go.    What an amazing job they did for restaurant week I seriously don't have a single complaint.  The portions were huge and they did 4 courses not 3.  I started with the mussels (prob my favorite food) these mussels did not disappoint leeks and saffron in this amazing broth with plenty of bread to dip.  My sister ordered the eggplant and mozzarella app and that was also extremely tasty.  Next up a salad nothing special but fresh and delicious.  I ordered the salmon for my entree it was served with creamy wasabi mashed potatoes and bok choy.  I know I have mentioned this in my reviews before but you can't leave this place without having the bread pudding it's the best dessert I have ever had.  I have had the famous bread pudding at Commander's Palace in New Orleans and it has nothing on the bread pudding at Bistro La Bon recipe please?",

However, our experience is far from good.  The waitress had a huge attitude.  She got the orders completely messed up.  We were there at 6:30.  The food did not come till 10:30.  The portion is so small that it took less than 5 mins to finish.    The waitress did not come to check with us one single time during the meal.  I order the duck breast.  For how long it took, you would think they are catching the free range duck and killing it in the back!  It taste good, but Charlotte has plenty of restaurants that have the similar quality of food, same price range, but bigger portion and much much much better service.    The waitress brought out the bill and argue with us that it's not her fault that the kitchen didn't see our order.  Seriously?  As customers, we don't care who in the restaurant messed up.  We ate three plates of bread within the four hours.  And by the way, I don't think the bread is complimentary.  You have to ask for it!  No butter comes with the bread either.  When we were complaining to the manager that its been almost 4 hours, the waitress walked by and said \" its only been two!\"  Right, because two hours is acceptable?  The manager is nice enough to come apologize after we complained to her, and she gave the discount to the final bill.  But seriously, life is too short to wait for 4 hours in a restaurant for your dinner.  I have been in Charlotte for 4+ years, we eat out few times a week.  This is by far the worst experience ever.  Save yourselves.  This place is not worth a visit!",

We had to pause conversation everytime a loud truck or motorcycle passed.   The service was terrible. We had to ask for EVERYTHING....from Coffee (and refills) to Salt and Pepper. The only brunch choice was the buffet which offered the strangest choices: it was the first time I'd seen Swedish Meatballs as part of a brunch lineup. Additionally, there were NO egg choices on the line, although you could order scrambled eggs and bacon (no other egg varieties) as well as Chocolate Waffles and Brioche French toast from your server (included in the brunch price). On the line they had house-smoked salmon, but no bagels and creamcheese to go with it (but they did have the capers, boiled egg, and tomato).   The baked goods had some \"brunchy\" choices, but aside from the fruit and grits on the line, the entire line was an odd assortment of lunch options, none of which impressed me...the mac and cheese was bland and the build your own salad was lacking in choices.   Overall, I'd skip Bistro La Bon for brunch. There are much better options in Charlotte. I will give it a second try, but for dinner next time.",

Both were delicious and fresh. We very rarely order dessert, but thought \"why not\" Lauren suggested the bourbon bread pudding. Excellent choice, not too sweet. Great way to end the meal.

For $35 pp, I expected it to be top notch according to previous yelp reviews.  Our waiter had to be flagged down to get service to our table most every time which was another let down.  The Eggs Benedict were dry and not good so ordered simple scrambled eggs with cheese and was charged an extra $1 for the cheese on top of the $35 pp charge.  This brunch did not include coffee or tea either.  Another extra charge of $3 pp.  I've been to other wonderful Easter Brunches at very nice restaurants that charge this kind of fee where you have steamed shrimp, prime rib, fresh salads, a multitude of choices, tea, coffee, or juices, etc.......but not the case here. Nothing special here, definitely over priced and over rated.  What a rip off of $100.  I don't know if it was just a bad day here but I guess I'll never know cause I won't be going back there and chance wasting my money. I should have asked for a refund now that I'm thinking about it.  It was truly that bad.",

    "text": "I still really enjoy Bistro but I have to retract my 5 star rating just a tad. Last night we went in (Valentines Day) and ordered a dessert to go. It is my favorite dessert and I've ordered it several times, the Bread Pudding.  My boyfriend lives less than a mile down the road so it literally was eaten as soon as we got home within 4 minutes of being handed over to us. I was so disappointed to see how the food was served. We were given one setting for two of us (which was fine I suppose), the top was completely burned (not fine), and the bread pudding itself was torn apart making it look like a mess more than a complete dessert. The dessert runs about $7 and usually is presented nicely in one piece and un-burned, if you can't deliver that on take-out don't offer it. I felt a little silly to rave about this dessert only to have it turn out that way.   I would give this experience 2 stars but I still enjoy the restaurant itself generally.",

It helps that I live just down the street and that the food is so delicious that I could eat it every day.  Saturday Brunch ...is soooo good. I have been to Saturday brunch twice and it seems to be the most underrated thing in the Queen City. It is not only delicious, but affordable!  (and the restaurant is not crowded at all). The three times I have been, there have only been about 3 or 4 tables occupied. Go there! The eggs benedict are excellent, the omelet is excellent, and the mimosas are only $3!!!! Definitely a must try, I haven't had a single thing on the Saturday brunch menu that I did not enjoy.  Sunday Brunch ...is also soooo good. I went with a group of friends on a rainy Sunday around 1pm. There was a 45 minute wait, and the hostess graciously let us put our name on the list, and leave and come back (I live just a hop, skip and a jump away, and my friend had just ran a half marathon). When we returned 45 minutes later, the place was still packed and we were seated promptly. If you are going to go here for Sunday Brunch, come hungry! It is an $18 all you can eat situation (an appropriately titled smorgasbord if you will), and we definitely took full advantage. Everything was delicious, and there is a wide variety to choose from (swedish meatballs, smoked salmon, key lime tarts, salads, grits, potatoes, fresh fruit...yum). Plus, there is french toast, bacon and eggs, and chocolate waffles that your waiter brings to your table family style. AND $3 MIMOSAS! woop. We stayed for 3 hours, and then I promptly went into a food coma when I got home.  Dinner I have also been to Bistro La Bon for date night when T was in town. It was a snowy Saturday evening, and we headed out a bit later, and there was not wait (the restaurant was busy though). I can't remember what we got as our starters, but I remember it was delicious. Then, there was a slight delay with our main courses, and the kitchen/our server was kind enough to send out a complimentary appetizer, the trio of dips (hummus, eggplant pesto and tapenade). So good, I and I loved the leftovers the next day. For our main, I had the mussels (it is an appetizer but the portion is HUGE) and it was great. I could have drank the sauce, but the bread it came with had to suffice. T had pork, and he totally enjoyed it. As a treat, I ordered the panna cotta for dessert (I was already stuffed but had to had it) and the proceeded to eat the whole thing. Another food coma ensued.  Can't wait to go back to take advantage of their monday night prix fix dinners and to enjoy some food on their patio in the nice weather. Don't let the Family Dollar lot fool you, this place is the best.",

    "text": "If I had the halvsies option I'd have selected 2.5 stars... I do not like to write negative reviews (except MIA) I'd prefer to write positive reviews and let the great places shine, share my outstanding experiences, and move on.  So I write this not in angst, but in a True hope that they can fix their issues and become a great restaurant one day.  Decor.. blah blah blah it's nice, don't care about that..   Service was good, although the timing coming out of the kitchen needs A LOT of work.  I understand, I've worked the restaurant world, but this place didn't open last week, and while a slight delay is acceptable, a 10 minute difference between first and last entrees shows nothing less than a lack of communication and proper planning...  ..this would only be acceptable if...   ...management or someone is to explain.. something.. lie to me.. I don't care, but at least approach the table and apologize.  Or make a conscious effort to assist (I watched what I assume to be a FOH manager walking around all night, we weren't hard to spot, we were the big 10 top in the middle of the restaurant, 5 of us had whole plates of food in front of us the others simply had plate-envy on their faces).  I do want to stress that the server, the trainee, and any assistants were excellent at what they did, management dropped the ball on this one, big time...  Food was good but.. (there has to be a but)  my wife didn't get what she ordered, they attempted to pass a steak off as a prime rib as if I was born yesterday and don't know what prime rib is... furthermore people will tolerate a bit more rareness in a prime rib than they may usually prefer in a grilled cut, so maybe, just maybe, you should communicate this to your customer and allow them to make another selection...  I know my wife, and she would not have selected what was brought.  I had the duck breast, and it was phenomenal, mid-rare, not too fat-chewy like mid-rare duck can be sometimes, truly delicious dinner.    The wine selection is great, they also have a nice list of beers and a full bar, so aces there.  They have a creative selection of appetizers and we all ordered different ones and swapped plates a bit (I know.. naughty) the charcuterie of mainly spanish meat and pickled veggies is delicious as were the scallops (but seriously.. 2 mid-sized scallops for $8???).  All in all I'd say try it, maybe you'll get what you order, maybe you wont, we had fun but our group could have had fun Fuel pizza that night, for me to spend nearly $200 for dinner and drinks for 2, I can do much better in the QC.    My recommendation, spend half as much, get more consistent French-Mediterranean food at Roosters in South Park, but as I stated earlier, I hope this place succeeds because good food is good for all people.  Best of luck.",

    "text": "B for effort, Bistro la Bon. I enjoyed your atmosphere, and your wine selection, don't get me wrong.  For me and my friend, dinner came out to $63. For hummus, 2 veggie risotto (terrible, terrible veggie risotto), and a napoleon for dessert.  When a restaurant has the guts to charge me $15 for rice with a few pieces of onion, brussel sprouts and beet-- they better be ready to get hit with a real critique. The appeal of the vegetable risotto was that it had \"hints\" of truffle oil. Hints are nice-- presenting a basic aroma while not overpowering the dish with oil and truffle. All of the veggies were almost greasy they were doused in so much truffle oil. The risotto wasn't cooked correctly-- the texture was cooked a pinch under al dente. I personally don't like my risotto even at al dente, but I know thats a personal opinion.  The hummus was decent but instead of homemade pita, it was served with pieces of this flaky, greasy pie crust-tasting stuff. Two-for-two: greasy food.  Lastly! The saving grace of the meal: the passion fruit napoleon. The layout was gorgeous and the texture was spot-on. The only negative was the overly bitter taste of the passion fruit cream. Made me and my date pucker (and I love sour things).  Sorry Bistro La Bon, at least you made quite a bit of money off of my meal.",

    "text": "If nothing else, Bistro gets my vote for Charlotte's ugly duckling award.  Who knew a strip mall best known for it's Dollar General and its proximity to the train tracks could turn out such a pleasant little restaurant with the promise to become something great?  Made it out here for brunch last week with the wife and a mutual couple friend after reading all the Yelp reviews that told me not to judge by the exterior of Bistro. So glad I listened to them!  First off, I'm not a big fan of buffets at any time of the day, but a breakfast buffet especially reminds me of Shoney's and its Big Boy mascot who tried to teach me as a youngin' that french toast can actually be made as identical strips that are uniform in texture and color.  Luckily, Bistro made a believer out of me.  It probably helps that the waffles and french toast come made to order direct to your table along with eggs and bacon served family-style.  The buffet was a great mix of fresh fruits and salads, and then a number of hot dishes for both those meat-lovers amongst us and our more vegetarian friends.  I skipped the meats completely and was more than full on the roasted vegetables, sweet potato hash, fresh fruit, and the wide selection of baked pastries and breads on the sideboard.  However, I am told the roast was wonderful.   I also liked the fact that the head chef was constantly outside of the kitchen monitoring the buffet for himself.  He made a point to ask myself and other diners if we had any questions about any of the dishes.  Now that's service and the kind of thing that shows me this buffet is not going solely for maximum volume of food.    And did I mention the $3 Mimosa specials with brunch?  Seriously can't find much to bicker with here.  Just make sure your dining companions are either local or get a prep talk that you're not taking them to Sketchville for a hobo meal.  This ugly duckling is a swan inside.",

    "text": "When I was 16 I had my car broken into outside of Bistro La Bon when it wasn't Bistro La Bon. Now, 8 years later, I ventured in this morning to try out their Sunday brunch I had heard so much about and was blown away.  First of all, who KNEW that the inside of that dumpy little strip mall could be transformed into such a cool space?! I am a believer! There was a good 10-15 people waiting for tables, but the woman at the front said that we could eat at the bar if we wanted and we headed straight there ~ I like to be as close to the beer as possible anyways.  Trip 1 to the buffet made me go \"hmmm, innnnteresting\". House made mozzarella with pesto and tomatoes, fresh greens with lemon dill dressing, sweet potato hash, braised cabbage and kielbasa, beef brisket, a roasted  vegetable medley, Swedish meatballs, a beet dish, a ham salad dish, and some potatoes au gratin with a ton of breads, muffins and pastries to choose from as well.  I got a bite of everything and was really impressed with the veggie medley, sweet potato hash, lemon dill dressing, braised cabbage, and the house made mozz. All of it was just so fresh and inviting, or warm and comforting with a heavy helping of \"so much better than i could do this at home\" - the other dishes were good too, sans the Swedish meatballs which I thought didn't have a distinct taste to them.  At the bar, our bartender was SLAMMED but remained friendly and attentive. She let us know we could order some a la carte breakfast items included in the buffet from her so I tried some scrambled eggs (delish, and enough came out for 2!) and my amigo tried the french toast (HUGE bread, and soooo moist!). At the end of our great meal, we got some of the fresh fruit they had out (all was ripe and delish) and we ordered the chocolate waffles. CHOCOLATE WAFFLES. Listen, I don't even LIKE waffles, but holllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly breakfast, Batman! These were sinful, amazing and the perfect end to a really excellent experience.  I'll def be coming back here soon, especially since it's so close to mi casa! :D",

There were no eggs, bacon, or anything like that.  You had to order that separately.    Here is some of the items they did feature.  Fruit, salad, crab mac and cheese, beef brisket, biscuit and gravy, curried cauliflower, and an assortment of scones.  All and all, I was a little disappointed in the selection for brunch.  However, I heard dinner was great and I look forward to coming and checking that out soon.  Brunch might not have been the best for me but I'm sure there are others that will love it!!",

I was a little concerned when I saw it was in a strip mall, but this is definitely a book that cannot be judged by its cover. The inside was deceptively large and decorated in such a way that the one large open space would easily be divided in case of large private parties.   Perusing the menu, my sister and I decided to choose a few options and split them. We ended up with the brie brulee (our friends shared an order, too), the gnocchi, and the squash lasagna. Three small plates were basically licked clean and we waddled out completely satisfied. Our friends also had the brussel sprouts and each had an order of the lavender chicken, which they swear is their favorite entree on the menu.   Our waters were constantly magically filled by the attentive staff and we always had fresh plates for our next course. I was really very impressed with this hidden spot and am hoping to return for the lavender chicken in the future.",

The food was very tasty but the portions were small and the service was lacking. Any time we needed something, we had to make several requests to multiple people before it showed up. For instance, we asked for bread four times before we got any. A server even told us our extra bread was warming up, but never brought the additional basket. The flourless chocolate cake was rock hard, and we asked for a candle in one of the desserts because there was a birthday and the server forgot it. He forgot our dessert orders and had to re-take them, and I took the opportunity to remind him but her dessert still came out candleless. To top it off, because we were more than 6 people they included a 20% gratuity. No wonder they were comfortable giving us such mediocre service, they were getting a good tip either way. I will definitely NOT be back.",

The bread pudding for dessert was the only downer; it didn't quite have enough of the pudding texture.   Our service was great. There were a couple of mistakes with the food last night and our server, Juan, promptly had them fixed. The hosts were also great as they seated us.   I would definitely recommend for restaurant week. It was a fun atmosphere and they had live music.",

    "text": "Heard from many that BLB is a hit and sure enough, it really delivered.   Had a party of 8 and ordered quite a variety of small plate dishes and most were really well executed. Tuna Tartare was well presented and delicious.. good balance of heat and salt and very fresh. Swedish Meatballs were also spot on as were the Brussel Sprouts. Only real miss of the night were the pepedew peppers stuffed with goat cheese- meh.   For the mains, both steaks (bone-in filet and a massive ribeye) were fantastic- perfectly cooked and with a beautiful crusty char on them.. rivals any top-end steakhouse. Salmon was excellent as well although one was undercooked and had to be returned.   Sweets were steady but rather unremarkable- a cheesecake didn't taste all that \"homemade\", a chocolate cake was tasty but very sweet and a bread pudding that could have used some of that sweetness. Pretty bland.   Save the best for last- the service. Our server did a fantastic job (as we had a lot of high maintenance peeps) and knew the menu front and back. Cocktails and wine service was right on as well.",

I love that there is a buffet and that you can also order made to order eggs, bacon, etc.. all included. The bellinis and coffee were also really good. My favorite thing on the buffet was the brisket. It is definitely worth more than one trip to the buffet line. I just think this place offers several choices and the service was really good. I think I may be adding this place to my weekend schedule.",

Let me just say for starters that we we're very small girls who order too much for our small appetites, but we definitely finished everything! All of the dishes were very flavorful and delicious.

If you like eggs benedict, there are quite a few options. We also enjoyed bloody marys, which were delicious too. In terms of service, the server was accommodating of a few simple substitutions, which was much appreciated. Otherwise, the service was just okay in terms of friendliness, and we felt a bit rushed towards the end of the meal. Overall, I would recommend Bistro La Bon for the food and atmosphere.",

Everyone, repeat after me: strip malls are our friends. They are home to some of Charlotte's most amazing gems.   Food-wise, I've had almost the entire menu. Well excluding brunch, I haven't been here yet for that. If I'm solo for lunch, I'll get the crab cakes & salad. If I'm with a group, I love to get as many plates to share. The Swedish Meatballs are incredible. Chef Majid learned his craft working in some of Sweden's best kitchens. I love the grilled octopus with the ratatouille and citrus aioli. The crispy avocado & asparagus is exactly how it sounds. Simple, but delicious. The fried brussels, the spicy shrimp and chorizo, mussels, lavender chicken, lamb lollipops-- all great. I'll stop before I end up writing the entire menu on here.   My hands down favorite cocktail is the Jalapeno Basil Martini. I get every time. Thursdays, half price select bottles of wine. Sundays, $3 Mimosas and $4 House Bloody Mary's.   I love the quirky vibes and atmosphere. Great spot for date night, girls night, meeting. Nice little bar and patio areas. You can even make a reservation right here on Yelp.",

My friend got the French toast ($9) .. it was a little disappointing as it was just one piece of bread and rather small. She ordered a side of bacon ($6) which helped.  Only negative comment.. pricing on sides was just silly compared to everything else on the menu.  Our server was so funny and nice - very attentive and accommodating. I'll definitely be back.",

I came in with my Mom, and let him know that we were having brunch to celebrate her birthday.  With a cheeky expression he replied, \"no one ever told me Happy Birthday\"....umm not the response I expected, but we didn't let him ruin the celebration.  He didn't even tell her Happy Birthday! I told him happy belated because I kind of felt bad for him.  He seemed to lighten up by the end of our meal, but I think it's common knowledge to leave your issues at the door when you step foot into the workplace. It's not like he was at a drive -thru (when there's not much to be expected) or panhandling on a random corner.",

The menu is not extremely extensive but at 1:00 on a Saturday the food was delivered quickly and the presentation was fair. The  portion sizes will make you satisfied but probably not full/stuffed. The side eggs my friend ordered were quite greasy and you can see the coat of oil to the side or the plate. The potato cakes are somewhat bland. (And I'm not one to add salt/pepper unless absolutely necessary) The crab and chives omelette had good helpings of crab pieces however it tasted like imitation crab. Overall, the food was adequate and i would go again to try different food options. I will say the signature drinks and mimosas ($3) were great! My friend's French toast was amazing (super fluffy, right amount of powdered sugar and sweetness) I'll definitely go back for that.

    "text": "Quite the revelation. Especially if you remember the shopping center from the 80s and 90s. The Family Dollar a few doors down recalls the down market past, and even the Thomas Ave. funk of recent vintage is stepped up several notches with BLB's take on fine dining in the Plaza/Midwood corridor.  The space itself is surprisingly open, airy, and woody and makes good use of its corner location. The vibe is absolutely more upscale than neighbors like Dish, but not stuffy. That is plus for dinner service -- if it can find a sustainable market.  Both the wine and beer selections seemed well informed, a nice, caring touch. Apps skew toward a Mediterranean palate, but creatively so. Hence a Pan Seared Halloumi (cheese made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk) that won big fans and the duh, no-brainer in retrospect pairing of avocado & asparagus in a crunchy almost egg-roll deal. Strong flavors that stopped stop of overpowering.  Entrees show an inflection point. The Swedish meatballs are huge faves and stretch from the popular Sunday brunch to the dinner menu. Fine. But the specials struck me as particularly creative and well-executed. A cumin and caraway encrusted rack of lamb on a bed of pearl couscous and peas managed to be both rich and very light. And halibut catch of the day was a tremendous example of seafood prepared simply -- without gobs of butter or cheap wine trying to mask the flavor. Or salt. Had to have been one the most lightly salted prepared meals I've had in a long time. Wonderful.  The inflection comes with the price -- $26 for the lamb, $29 for the halibut. Totally and completely worth it for any remotely serious diner. But also pushing the tab to a $50 per person price point that I am not entirely certain the corridor can support (although it should.) Interesting, our server mentioned that they were moving to more of a tapas-style small plate approach -- which is usually a sign that owners are afraid they are pricing themselves out of a market and hope to make up the difference on alcohol. (Must note that across the parking lot neighbor Soul Gastrolounge does do a big biz on the tapas/small plate/sushi tip.)  Aping that approach would be a shame as BLBs top tier fine dining entrees really do set BLB apart from anything in East Charlotte.",

It has the classic techniques of French food with a wider range of European flavors.  My first time here I had the gnocchi with mushrooms.  I make gnocchi so I am very familiar with good gnocchi, not heavy in your stomach gnocchi, that you sometimes find in restaurants.  These were so tender and the flavors were unbelievable!  I used the bread to sop up all that great sauce!!  My second time here, my waiter Julian, gave me an excellent recommendation, Lavender Chicken. I never order chicken out.  Then he went on to describe it.  He made my mouth water.  So, even though I was shaking my head on the lavender, I ordered it.  The flavors again were over the top.  The chef really has it together.

    "text": "Disgusted, and we will never be back.    When we called to make a reservation for Sunday brunch (party of 4) Bistro La Bon told us in 2 different phone calls to the restaurant that they would not be accepting reservations.    Expecting huge crowds, we arrived early enough and were glad to see that we were the 4th party in line (as they open at 10am).  We were confident we would get a table as we were so close to the door.     Upon seeing the completely empty restaurant, the hostess asked, \"do you have a reservation?\"   Surprised, we responded, \"No, we called and were informed that reservations would not be available.'   The hostess replied, \"Oh, we do take reservations for parties of 10 or more.\" We were shocked, because there was no mention of this rule when we attempted to make our reservation.   We were offered a small bar table or wait for \"about an hour.\"   During this exchange, a steady stream of about 15+ people were ushered in ahead of us.  They seamed to have appeared from out of nowhere.  We watched as our seating options dwindled before our very eyes.   Disgusted, we left and made waffles at home.  Happy Mothers Day!     We felt cheated and misled by Bistro La Bon. And up to now, we had always recommended this restaurant to friends, family and out of towners - NO MORE.    I don't care how the food tastes if this restaurant does not treat their customers fairly - take reservations or don't.  I wish I could give zero stars.",

    "text": "SUNDAY BRUNCH BUFFET  While there was nothing on this brunch menu that was the best, most interesting thing I've ever eaten, the food was solid and comforting and hit the spot.  Overall, I was entertained, and that's worth a good rating for me.    SALAD - I know, boring, right?  But the dressings were interesting and good.  I enjoyed the lemon dill vinaigrette.  JALAPENO MAC AND CHEESE - nice!  Stayed creamy even on the buffet.  The jalapenos gave a bit of flavor.    ASIAGO GRITS - I couldn't taste any cheese, but the grits were perfectly cooked.  POTATO GRATIN - I thought everything on the buffet needed a good amount of salt added, but that was easy enough for me to do myself.  The potatoes were what they were supposed to be.  Thin layers of potato in a creamy sauce.  Nothing earth shattering, but a nice staple.  BREADS - They keep a cranberry walnut bread, mini cranberry scone and nice sliced french bread on the buffet. This offering could have been greatly enhanced by adding some butter and jam.  The french bread was good, but the scone was dry and hard and the cranberry walnut bread also tasted a bit dried out.  Again, butter would have covered these issues.  PASTRIES - SO GOOD!!  The mini lemon tarts were fabulous.  Usually on tarts like that the dough is flavorless and often gets soggy, but this crust was perfectly sweet and crispy, and a nice foil to the tart lemon custard filling.  Coconut macaroons were crispy and sweet - absolutely what they should be.  Apple puff pastry was light and airy with a little crispiness to the flaky layers of dough and just enough filling to make it sweet and tasty.  CHOCOLATE WAFFLE - not totally sure this is worth the hype.  The waffle itself was a bit soft and the chocolate flavor clearly comes from the chocolate syrup on top.  The syrup was rich and dark tasting, and did make the waffle nice.  But not nice enough for me to waste more than one bite on it.  EGGS & BACON - The eggs were perfectly soft and scrambled, but the bacon was super limp and soggy.  Not ideal at all.  FRENCH TOAST - I'm not usually a fan, but surprisingly I enjoyed this french toast.  Warning: it comes out completely soaked in syrup.  We had two orders on our table.  One order was perfect, the other tasted way too egg-y.  But the delicious one was worth 4-5 stars.  MIMOSA - Strong and tasty and cheap!  $3  SERVICE -  A little spotty (not available) at times, but waiter was nice and pleasant.    ATMOSPHERE -  I love the casual but pretty interior here.  The buffet was a little painful to get to, as there was only one way to walk and that involved trying not to hit other diners heads or chairs and avoiding road block with another diner/waiter.    $20 Sunday Brunch buffet.  A bit pricey for what you get, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.",

Yes, ok? We are those people.)  Finally, my date ordered the saffron veggie risotto, and I didn't like it at all! I'm not a super picky person, but the dish wasn't good. 1 star.   I definitely need to go back and try out some other dishes to see if they have anything else that matches the gnocchi.",

We ordered four tapas plates.  The first to arrive was crispy asparagus and avocado, encased in a fried spring roll which was light and not greasy.  It was accompanied by a sweet chili sauce.  Next, we were served a trio of dips:  plain hummus, smoked eggplant and olive hummus with crackers.  The plain hummus was very lemony in almost a sweet way, reminding me of lemon frosting.  The olive hummus had full-on olive favor and the smoked eggplant was nothing like I had ever tasted before, in a good way.  Next, my husband ate grilled octopus.  He raved about the sauce, but said the octopus did not have much flavor by itself.  Meanwhile, I enjoyed the fried cheese.  Wonderful!  After all, it was cheese!  Cozy ambiance, good service and excellent cuisine guarantee a return.",

Our server recommended a bunch of items, but i was finding it very hard to find an entree to order and found that i wanted almost all the apps!   So we started with the Fried oysters- good and the Lamb Wellington- ehh...it was ok. We then moved on and had the Branzino per the servers stellar recommendation, it was so dry and barely had any \"meat\" to eat that it was just not like any Branzino we've ever had it was mostly skin, whereas Branzino is a nice white flaky Mediterranean fish with a good oil base to it,  they just ruined it. I had the Grilled Chicken with Spinach Gnocchi in a mushroom cream sauce, good I would have preferred my Gnocchi's a little smaller, they were just too big and doughy, but the Chicken was French Cut and cooked just right.  We didn't stay for dessert, I think we were both hesitant to get anything else so we called it a night and headed over to Whiskey Warehouse :) . I haven't decided if I would be back but the server was very nice.",

Goat Cheese Tartlett: OMG.....this thing is a beauty, with mushrooms on top, flaky crust, and yummy goat cheese inside. I could have eaten another one!  For dinner my friend had the meatballs. They were lovely. The potatoes tasted like they were 1/2 and 1/2 potatoes and potato flakes....which would be my only complaint...but, overall the dish was still excellent.  I had the Pan Seared Dorade Royal. I really enjoyed this dish! The fish was cooked nice and crispy on the skin side, and was moist and perfectly done. The rice was just incredible....loved that flavor.  The portions are perfect. I ate everything, was not overstuffed, but not a lot to take home either.  I am seeing a lot of comments about the neighborhood....it's in Plaza Midwood....which is a fine location if you ask me. I felt comfortable and safe there.  We will definitely be back!!!

They have a full bar in a separate area from the main dining area.  The one negative was that the filet mignon I ordered medium came close to well done.  You may want to order on the rare side and have it cooked a little more if it is too rare, since you can't send a steak back to make it more rare!

    "text": "Bistro La Bon just opened up in Plaza Midwood, next to the Family Dollar store, and it has a really nice look and feel.   Although the menu is French-influenced, the service is much, much faster than any French bistro I've ever dined at.  Note:  Bistro La Bon will not have its liquor license for a few more weeks, but if you go down the street to Common Market and buy bottles of wine from there, Bistro La Bon will uncork and serve your wine without any additional fee.  For this free service, the wine has to be purchased at Common Market (which has good prices on wine).  We were in a hurry, so we only ordered tapas items:  duck confit, mushroom brioche, hummus and baba ganoush, and blue crab cannelloni.  The baba ganoush was extremely good and a little unique due to a slight drizzle of balsamic vinegar laced around it.  I loved the duck although my dining companion, who eats more duck, thought it could have been a little less dry (I disagree).  She loved the mushroom brioche which I also thought was very tasty.  My absolute favorite, however, was the blue crab cannelloni which was rich and flavorful but not too overwhelmingly rich.  I am thrilled that this restaurant has opened because the last time I checked, Charlotte had few real French restaurants, to my knowledge.  We need more French restaurants, and with the Family Dollar parking lot right there, this restaurant is extremely convenient.  Finally, while we did not have dessert, it appeared that their desserts are incredible.",

We had to wait well over our quoted time ( no biggie, a lot of people were there for FREE) they let several parties go ahead if us that came in after us. Granted they were pretty packed, but there was about enough room for 20 seats on the patio and it was a beautiful day, so no reason not to use it. We asked the hostess if we could just go in for a drink while we wait, she said no. It was like Fort Knox trying to even go in. After over 1hr  (quoted 40 min) wait we finally got sat at the bar. The staff was rude, including the manager...he was fussing at the bartender in front if us, totally unprofessional. We asked if there was drink specials, and the response was \"uh-no don't you think free lunch is special enough\" Dirty glasses were set in the bar beside us and ignored for most if the time we sat there. The food was bad, lacked flavor and selection. A little salt and pepper makes a world of difference...that should be culinary 101. Most if the time we went up to the buffet it was empty.  They need to leave the shrimp and grits up to Charleston restaurants, it tasted like instant grits w/shrimp thrown in as an after though....I make better shrimp and grits. No way would I'd pay $10 for this. Either they weren't prepared for the crowd or they have no idea what good food taste like. Also, they were doing free lunch yesterday and several people behind us in line said they had come yesterday for the same... They got in faster than we did...didn't think that was right, they'd already taken advantage if the freebie. Would NOT recommend this place, there are too many other great restaurants close by to chose from...spend your money there. Thank goodness it was free and I didn't have to pay for such a disappointing experience. #lame",

I know, I know, the first thing you're gonna say is, \"Hey, it's free so what do you expect?\"  If the whole point is for me to come back and actually spend my pennies at their establishment, I expect at least good to excellent.    So here it is.  My friend and I went to La Bon hoping to get a sample of their free buffet.  I've never been here and love coming across new places to try.  The buffet started at 11:30am, my friend and I arrived at 11:15am and there was already a small line.  No problem since I knew I wasn't the only one to get the memo.  However, I guess I didn't get the memo about making a reservation to this free buffet, neither did 99% of the people waiting in line.  I found the fact that you could even make a reservation to an event like this odd to say the least.  The restaurant was already full by the time we got there.  Anyway, since most of the people in line did not make a reservation they either left or put their name on a waiting list to get inside; the wait, I was told, was an hour.  We decided we'd wait (since I'd driven all the way from Monroe, NC, but little did we know we had a special wait.  Get this, two parties that arrived AFTER us were seated BEFORE us because they were trying to seat us at a table for the baby.  Oh I didn't mention that, we had a baby with us and apparently, unbeknownst to us there are special tables that can accommodate babies, GO FIGURE!  Being that that was one of the dumbest things we'd ever heard, we told them to seat us at a \"tap\" table which of course was perfectly fine with a high chair.  I still chuckle at how idiotic this was.  The whole process was so unorganized and it showed.  We had to ask for silverware, water, and water refills.  To top everything off, the food was so mediocre.  I was truly dumbstruck at this point.  The only good thing, and I do mean only, were the meatballs.  If the options at the free buffet are going to be on their regular buffet, I truly couldn't see myself paying $10.00 for it anyway.  Maybe their other offerings are great, but based on my experience I will never find out.",

The only thing that knocks it down a star is that we were seated in a table where one side was a bench along the wall and the other was chairs. It was comfortable however the tables were extremely close together - making it uncomfortable to get out and you were also part of your neighbors' conversations. Interesting.",

    "text": "I want it I be good, but it just isn't. I've been there for brunch and was underwhelmed. The food was good, but I left starving and actually went to get a smoothie after spending $60 on brunch.  I decided to give it another try during restaurant week and was immediately disappointed. We were greated by a manager who took our drink order because the server was too busy.  The jalapeno basil martini was too spicy to enjoy on its own. I received the wrong salad as the first course, but decided to eat it since the server just disappeared.  It had no flavor and the lettuce was in huge pieces and was difficult to eat. My girlfriend ended up switching with me because she didn't like her beat salad (which we both ordered).  It too was just bland and uninspired.  Our filet and lamb came, then about 3 mins later we got steak knives. My lamb was almost rare, we waived down the server and he asked if I ordered it that way. I didn't. They brought a new medium cooked plate, which tasted good, but half of the meat was completely over salted and I couldn't enjoy it.  Also, it's too dark in there to see what you're eating or cutting in to.  I definitely will not be returning or recommending Bistro La Bob.",

I got me really excited about the menu.We immediately attacked the small plate section. That's where the diversity in flavor and texture seemed to be. There are some cool Asian and Spanish touches going on here. The crispy avocado and asparagus small plate was a hit at our table. Though we were a little scared about the texture of avocado and asparagus, they managed to get a satisfying crispy shell on it that held it all together. Flavors were really interesting- Asian fusion goodness. Grilled Spanish octopus was a table favorite- perfect tender octopus and a hit of heat with that chorizo oil. Whatever that saffron cream on the Prince Edward Island mussels was all about...we were spooning that into our mouths, mopping it up with bread, using our fingers, whatever we had to do to ensure not a drop of it was left on the plate. We rounded things out with a couple of beet and watermelon salads and goat cheese stuffed peppadews, which were nice sweet, spicy and savory bites that satisfied the vegetarians. Negronis were our drinks of choice. I would say the only downside was that our spot didn't have enough light- so the beauty of the plating was a little lost on us, though we did rig a spotlight with our iphone flashlights.",

    "text": "A wonderful gem in a rough setting. I have had lunch, brunch, and supper and have enjoyed each.  The service is always attentive and chatty, while not overwhelming.  The decor is comfortable with a nod towards more formal dining.  When very crowded, however, the concrete floors and mostly hard surfaces do make for something of an echo chamber.  The brunch Sunday afternoons is lovely, with a great variety of meats, pastas, fruit, and baked goods.  The shortbread/biscuits are not to be missed.  My other favorite is the brisket, which is odd, given that I am not much of a meat eater.   It is positively fork tender and rests in its own delicious juice.  They also cook to order french toast (VERY custardy) and chocolate waffles (which I liked fine despite usually not being much of a chocolate person).  There is often a line for brunch.  For lunch throughout the week, they offer a reasonable selection of small plates, entrees, and desserts.  Supper is more expensive, but still a good value for what you receive.  My other half is a vegetarian, and the chef gladly prepared something to his taste when asked (and it was quite good).  I've tried every variation of dessert they offer and have loved each.  Overall, this is my favorite restaurant on my end of town.",

    "text": "We've been wow'd by a few restaurants, especially during Restaurant Week/ Queens Feast. Yet none have offered a meal such as Bistro La Bon. We chose it because the menu was very tempting, and we were pleased to find that the food did live up to the expectations. Wait, scratch that...it exceeded expectation!!! Bistro La Bon may not be in the nicest area, and the atmosphere is not the best, but the food itself makes up for all that a cajillion times over.  Bistro La Bon is located in a run down strip mall area, across the street from Lunchbox Records and next to Family Dollar. The strip mall looks very rundown and is definitely not appealing, but the little restaurant on the corner of the strip mall makes the trip worth it. Bistro's dining area is pretty large, yet the tables are crammed together too close for my own personal comfort. I was not liking the fact that the server's posterior was right in my face when taking orders or delivering food to the table next to us. The close quarters also made the restaurant a bit too loud and I had difficulty hearing the miss' as she talked across from me at times. But enough about the mediocre ambiance...on to the food!!!  They had a decent wine selection but I felt the prices per glass were a bit much. Most of the wines ranged between $8-10, with the majority being $9...that's a bit much for a glass of Reisling. We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, which came with four courses. For the first course I had the Roasted Beet and Apple Salad and loved it. It was small and simple, and perfect as a first course. The beets and apples were chilled and tasted quite fresh. They were served on a bed of mixed greens, and the passion fruit dressing that accompanied it was fantastic. The miss' had the Arugula Salad that came with pear, bleu cheese and walnuts. The walnuts were candied and that sticky sweetness was great when combined with the other salad flavors.   For the second course I had the calamari, which was NOT fried and was stuffed with shrimp and currants. The calamari was so delicate, it was almost like eating pasta. The shrimp were fresh and they kicked it up by topping the calamari with a diavlo-type sauce, and dumped it all on top of a crispy slice of bread. It soaked up all that sauce and seafood flavor and it was great. I really enjoyed that spicy sauce! The miss' ordered the Prince Edward Island Mussels, and she devoured them. They were a really good-size portion, and the mussels all sat atop a bowl of this rich, creamy sauce. The mussels were cooked perfectly, and there was not a speck of sand to be found. I even enjoyed the mussels, and I'm generally not a shellfish fan. After finishing off the mussels she took the two pieces of bread that came with it and used them to sop up as much of that creamy sauce as possible. It was a really, really good dish.  For the third (and main) course I went with the special of the day, which was rack of lamb. Though the chef recommended it medium I went over his head and ordered it medium rare, and it came out wonderfully. The lamb was cooked perfectly and wasn't too gamey. It came with a bed of chive mashed potatoes which were the bees knees, and I even enjoyed the freaking spinach, something I usually avoid at all costs. The big surprise on the dish was this lone slice of poached (I think), spiced pear that knocked my socks off. I didn't expect this piece of fruit on my dish, and I definitely didn't expect it to be so amazing. The miss' ordered the Wild Fresh Catch, which happened to be some North Carolina Triggerfish. The fish was quite tasty and wasn't too overly fishy. It was roasted to perfection and served with some fingerling potatoes that were also great.   Then came dessert, and this is what really sealed the deal for me. Since moving down here I've become addicted to bread pudding, and will almost always order it if we happen to get dessert with our meal, so of course I ordered the Bourbon Brioche Bread Pudding. This bread pudding was a huge chuck of bread that had a nice, firm consistency. The top of the bread pudding was burned so it got this wonderful crunchiness, and it was served with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream (truly decadent and rich) and this crazy good burned caramel sauce. All in all, this is my official Favorite Dessert in Charlotte!!! This miss' had the Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake, and if you are a chocoholic this is the dessert for you. Since it didn't have the flour it's pretty much like eating a giant truffle. The chocolatey taste blew me away and the richness was almost too powerful. The chocolate decadence is mellowed out a bit by the scoop of mango sorbet. This place definitely knows dessert!  Bistro La Bon is more than a normal restaurant. The chefs work magic back in the kitchen to produce such high-quality food, and every bite was tastetacular. We may not be willing to pay to go on a regular ol' day, but I think it's a safe bet that we will be back next Restaurant Week.",

The tuna crudo appetizer wasn't very memorable, but it wasn't bad either.  The duck main course was something I could've cooked at home, so it wasn't something that stood out much.  Still, it was a good meal.  For dessert, I had the recommended bread pudding.  I am a huge fan of bread pudding, and was surprised to find their bread budding less \"bready\" and more creamy.  Definitely order this.  The service was very friendly and on point, and not obtrusive nor insincere.    Go and give this place a try.  It's definitely much better than most places in Charlotte, which tends to be all about comfort food, or what I've recently read, \"frat-boy comfort food\" -- an apt description for the restaurants in this city.",

They had everything from salad items, to an olive / pickle mix, roast, Swedish meatballs, (and there is lingonberry sauce!), and some desserty type items, like mini muffins, pastries, and my favorite, the warm coconut macroons. In addition to the all you can eat buffet, you can order from the kitchen items that include brioche French toast (my husband declared this the best French toast he's ever had), eggs with bacon, and chocolate waffles. I thought the chocolate waffles would be waffles that have chocolate drizzled on them, and they did, but they were oh so much more! The waffles themselves were chocolate, and the dollop of whipped cream had chocolate in it. They were delicious!  The service was great. Our coffees and waters were kept constantly filled, and what we ordered from the kitchen came in minutes.  I think for the 2 of us that the bill came to about $38. Which for an all you can eat brunch buffet is not bad at all.  We made reservations (there were 4 of us), and when I made them on Friday afternoon, the only times left were 10 AM or 1:30 PM. We took 10 AM, since 1:30 seemed late for a brunch. It was quiet when we got there, but not empty. We took our  time, and by the time we left at about 12:15, the place was pretty boisterous. I would recommend making reservations, especially if you plan to get there after 11. If you get there before 11, then I think you won't have a problem.",

Besides the non choice location the intirior and food are some if the best in charlotte hands down.  My consort and i went to bistro la bon on a slow night. We order a variety of starters because we felt the most creative food was on that menu. We grilled halumi which was like a mozzerella grilled cheese on brioch and served with pears in port redux. Tomato-fennel soup: nuff said! The special mozerella was a miss for us not because of the mozz(amazzing) but because the pesto tasted like it was maxes out with spinich and no garlic or acid. We also got the duck confit which was served with crepe. It was drizzled with a sautern sauce which made me thick the whole dish was a delicious upscale version of chicken and waffles. For that dish to envoke that kind of memory was talent in execution. Dessert was an uneventful jd bread pudding. Iv had better.  Service was fab however i heard another server saying he didn't particularly like a certain wine and while i know u may have a certain taste, you sounded off- putting. You should have apealed to ur customers better. Talk about the flavors in a wine not that u don't like it.  I will be back bistro la bon!",

I called ahead to put us on the list. We were promptly seated around noon.  It was busy but not packed, yet.  Upon seating the waiter asks for your drink order and if you would like the french toast and chocolate waffles. Might I add that he french toast is some or the best you will ever have. The waffles were only OK to me and I love chocolate.  We took our plates and headed for the brunch buffet. The fresh fruit was wonderful, all of the baked goods were top notch. The macaroons are better than Amelies'. The sweet potato hash missed a beat (underdone potatoes) but that was the only misstep. I hardly wanted to touch my eggs due to the amazing smorgasbord available but bacon was quite good. They had an array of cold and warm salads including roasted beet as well as a black forest ham orzo option. The Swedish meatballs are a must if you are a meat eater.   Suffice it to say, you have to visit Bistro La Bon at least once for Brunch if you can. It is absolutely worth every penny. Bring your appetite and you will not be disappointed.",

Yes, I've been totally smitten with the chocolate waffles served at Sunday brunch.  This is not to diminish the  wonderfulness of the other items served, but this is like eating chocolate air further indulged with chocolate sauce and whipped cream.  I ate mine at the end of the meal as sort of a dessert, however, it's not nearly as sweet as it sounds,.  Other items I found delectable were the Swedish Meatballs, the Mozzarella Pinwheels and the Silver Dollar Biscuits.  There was a great selection of items on the buffet with plenty of options for vegetarians as well.    I'll definitely return for a rendezvous with my new love!  I'll make a reservation next time--I was lucky to get a table right at noon without one this time.  As it grows in popularity, which I'm sure it will,  reservations will be a must at prime time.  Luckily they do serve until 3 pm for those who might want to dine when it's less crowded.",

Luckily, the manager was able to step in and save our overall view of the restaurant (good management goes a long way), so we may give it another go for dinner--but it's a no from us on brunch. Eggs were bland and nondescript. The biscuits and gravy were salty and grainy. I requested biscuits on their own and the waitress got caught up loving on her boyfriend and let them hang out under a heat lamp so long they came out hard as frisbees. I'd suggest going elsewhere for brunch--there are plenty of better options in CLT.",

We were seated quickly, but there was a large party in the back so the cooks were backed up and it took a while to get our food. Our server was apologetic and even gave us each a free Mimosa due to the wait. I was not really upset over the wait since I was with an old friend I hadn't seen in 10 years so we used that time to catch up. But not everyone would be as forgiving as me.   I was not very happy with my food today during Saturday Brunch. My guests ordered the Omelette (which he liked) and I ordered the Open Faced Breakfast Sandwich which was hmmmm pretty despicable. I could smell the meat when the plate was put in front of me. It had that old, gamey smell. I'm thinking hmmmm, should I eat this? The meat was so bad, I couldn't eat most of it. Tasted like rubber marbles. I should've ordered the Breakfast Burger which I have had before and was delicious.   My advice. Don't order the Open Faced Breakfast Sandwich.",

    "text": "From the outside Bistro La Bon looks like a small place but upon entering, you see the outside appearance is deceiving.  This is actually a decent sized restaurant with plenty of seating, a bar and a classy lounge area.    It is nicely decorated with local art on the walls.  The tables and chairs are of various styles which compliment each other very well.  The only downside is the music is a little loud that you can hardly hear your server explain the specials.   The menu is brief,  There are a few appetizers, salads and entrees on the menu that they have obviously mastered.  They also have daily specials.  Today I ventured into the land of beef and filet mignon.  It came accompanied with a russet potato and sweet potato gratin, seasoned pear, and green beans in a savory sauce.   The meal was nicely balanced - nothing was very heavy.  The meat was perfectly cooked medium rare as I requested and tender and flavorful.  The scallop appetizer was also delicious although we couldn't figure out what the scallops were laying on.    For dessert, I had a special which consisted of half a peach sitting in a light pastry with a lightly sweet sauce and dollop of vanilla ice cream.  Again, the portion was not too heavy and just the right size.  This is another gem in Charlotte that everyone should experience at least once.  I think I could come here once a week!     The only criticism I have is that our waiter could not be heard very well, partly because he was looking elsewhere when explaining the menu items and specials but he was friendly and attentive along with the rest of the staff.",

Somehow they made eggs taste really really good (and you get a solid amount for $3.50).  The next highlight was the french toast.  It's probably overpriced, but it's really good. The eggs benedict with the potato cakes were quality as well.  The pricing is slightly above average, but you can tell they work hard to make their food taste good.

Don't get me wrong, the buffet, although haphazard, is quite delicious.  It included salad, bread, cheese assortments, undercooked potatoes au gratin, cheesy grits, Swedish meatballs (my favorite item on the line), biscuits with gravy, brisket (which we think was really pot roast), kielbasa, and an assortment of little cakes and desserts.  The Macaroon cookies and Swedish meatballs alone are worth trying this place out.  Our waiter told us they pride themselves on being farm to table and sourcing local ingredients.  The food was good but perhaps a little pricey.  It was $52 for 2 of us drinking tea and ordering the buffet only.  I will say the service was top notch.",

However, I recently went for a la carte brunch on Saturday and was less-than-impressed.  $3 mimosas, however, were the saving grace.  I ordered three sides for breakfast (eggs, potato, toast) and they came out on three separate tapas dishes.  It seems common sense to serve three breakfast items on a plate, but I had to ask for a plate and a couple of other items (such as butter) that I really feel a breakfast patron shouldn't have to ask for.  There was no \"anticipation of needs.\"  The food was also not hot - barely warm.  I noticed the table next to mine sent their food back.  Service was slow, though we were there early and it was not yet busy.  The best part of brunch (aside from the mimosas) were the tiny scones served after the meal.  They were delicious, but it would be perfect if they were served with a tiny pot of jam (ya know, how scones are meant to be served?).  I may be back for dinner in the future, but probably not for brunch.  So sad because I was SO excited for their brunch!",

She handed us off to Juan, who is like the best server ever.  Super knowledgeable about the menu and GF options, amazing sense of timing for keeping up with our table, and a genuinely nice person! And now the food!  The bread was so good!  I ate the whole loaf!  And my crab cakes were so good!  My date had the tuna and avocado, spectacular!  And sides of grilled shrimp and fried brussel sprouts were perfect!   The decor of the restaurant was comfortable and beautiful and had a nice airy feeling, I can't wait to go back.",

They don't have enough servers for the number of people they're trying to seat, so your service is very spotty (you have to get up from your table to find your waiter and ask for anything and you're lucky to get one drink the whole time you're there). So they end up turning over the tables very slowly making the wait way longer than it needs to be for a buffet.  Food is fine but nothing special for the $30 per person you pay.",

I did come when there were almost no other customers, though.",

The staff was very nice & helpful with the menu. Our waitress was also the bartender and we never felt neglected, which is rare when someone has two jobs like that. We stuck to a mostly appetizer meal between three of us. The crispy Brussels sprouts (awesome sauce on it), pork belly (request the GF option & it comes on a soft apple slice), & the baked brief (crowd favorite). I enjoyed that our apps came out one at a time so our table wasn't crowded. Y'all, I almost forgot to mention the KILLER BLUEBERRY MARGARITA. Do not let the blueberry deter you from ordering. It's awesome. And the salt around the rim is mixed with cayenne pepper for an extra kick which we've since adopted for our margs at home.",

At first, my plate came out cold (still good). Our waitress and the kitchen staff remedied the situation very quickly with a new plate. There was nothing left of my food once our waitress came to clear the table. So delicious. Next time, I will try the French Toast as two others within our party were making me jealous of their plates. Also, $3 mimosas, bellinis, and (huge) coffees!   In addition to the food and service, I was greeted by a wonderful hostess. I feel so bad that I cannot remember her name because she took the time to remember mine and called me by it whenever she engaged with me. I loved that.",

I made my first reservation for two, then a made another reservation while eating hahaha!!! A week later I came back with two more friends, everything was delightful!   So clearly, I loved everything about this place!  Bistro La Bon is located in the Plaza Midwood area, across the street from Midwood Smokehouse! Another restaurant I need to visit!! There's plenty of parking available.   The menu offers ten brunch entrees to choose from. Thus far I've had the French Toast, Crab Omelet, and Asiago Grits!! All great selections in my opinion. Just a side note the Asiago Grits are large enough to share between two people. My favorite item so far is the Crab Omlete, which comes with actual claw meat, not imitation crab.  I added their signature Bearnaise Sauce and a side of Asiago Grits to my order. They also offer $3 Mimosas, Bellini's and $5 Bloody Marys.   I can't wait to come back for dinner. I hear the menu is delightful!",

The host for the evening was very friendly and seated my party of 6 quickly as we trickled in.   We came in for restaurant week and our server made recommendations off that menu. For starters my bf and I shared the gnocchi and spicy shrimp with chorizo. Loved everything about both starters, the gnocchi had an amazing sauce and loved the mushrooms in it, the shrimp had tons of flavor but not real spicy. My entree choice was the filet with crab cake and mashed potatoes. Pretty great all around, my steak was a touch over cooked but everyone else's was perfect. Crab cake was not the best ever but very tasty. Two courses down with great food and service, then dessert came out. This is the only spot things fell short for me. I had the bread pudding which is one of my favorite comfort food desserts, theirs was boring. Tasted like bread that had been soaked in milk but with no flavor, not much sugar or seasoning or anything, at least it was moist. I would absolutely return, just maybe try a different dessert.",

The decor was beautiful but there was no music playing, the only thing I could hear was the air conditioner.  Our server never told us his name and he was rather odd and soft spoken making it difficult to understand him when he told us about the specials.  I started with the goat cheese peppadew dish and it was delicious.  Others in my group ordered the lavender chicken and pork belly dishes which everyone raved about.  I had one of the specials, the rack of lamb with finger potatoes, squash and kale.  Every dish we had was very good including the desserts.  We all shared the flourless chocolate cake, carrot cake and creme brulle.  The food was great here but the experience still left something to be desired, eating somewhere that was silent as the grave was awkward.",

As well as thick French toast and chocolately waffles whose sweetness could supplement dessert, but only a fool would pass up a coconut macaroon. The lavish spread includes brisket, Swedish meatballs, a variety of salads, fresh fruit and pastries. With so much to choose from, you'll certainly get your money's worth ($16) and if you leave hungry, you must have done something wrong.",

There were not many people there but it was simple yet elegant inside. Don't let the proximity to a wig store and Dollar Tree deter you! Food: First, bread comes out. It is very good, you will not be sorry to at least sample it, especially the more inventive flavors (they rotate). The salad that comes with most meals is simple but light and dressed in house vinaigrette that is slightly citrusy but very good. I ordered the vegetable sandwich (with lots of veggies and goat cheese). It was served on cranberry walnut bread; although this may seem like a strange combination, it was delightful. The sweetness of the roasted veggies and the tang of the goat cheese played well with the sweet but hearty bread. I would definitely order this again. There are not a ton of vegetarian options but it is definitely doable to have a good vegetarian meal here. I split the Bourbon Brioche Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream with my friend. It was very good. I think that bourbon, caramel, and bread pudding are meant to be. The texture and taste were spot on. It was a perfect dessert to share (we were already very full anyway).  Go here for a date or to meet a friend. I haven't tried the Sunday brunch but that is next on my list.",

I have been here a few times for dinner over the past year and thought it was hit or miss. Heard about the brunch and tried it last June for my dad's b-day and also recently. Conclusion? Awesometown. Really excellent food. Brunch is $16/head which is actually quite fair given the food quality. Eggs/bacon, chocolate waffles and french toast are made to order, delicious, and many orders of each should be obtained.  The buffet has a great smoked salmon platter, delicious swedish meatballs and an wonderful apple/anise torte. I was also incredibly impressed my the level of service---the waiters are really on their game here. Also, very kid-friendly. We've brought our baby here twice, and it was super convenient. In fact, last time I visited, there was a baby shower, people with babies nursing at their table, and young kids around---the venue is a bit noisy so it really works with kids.  A plus in my book! Really, this place is hands down the best brunch place in Charlotte. The end.",

Especially if you are looking for a restaurant with the perfect ambiance, friendly staff, and food that will leave you wanting more after each bite.  My husband and I went to Bistro La Bon for our third wedding anniversary this past Wednesday and left with a mutual feeling...it is the best culinary and dining experience we have had in Charlotte!  We wanted to enjoy a relaxed yet romantic dinner so we chose to make reservations for the ten bite tasting, which only costs $35 per person. Each meal was uniquely different from one another, and we were always so curious as to what Chef Majid was going to surprise us with next.  To make the night even more special, my husband and I were the only ones participating in the tasting, this just so happened by chance.  The bartender actually wrote down our likes and dislikes to have the chef tailor the tastings to our liking.  While it was fabulous to have this attention, it saddened us that more people were not there to experience such amazing and unique food.  Definitely do not miss out on this restaurant!  What made the food so delicious is that it tasted as though each and every meal was made from scratch and that all the ingredients were fresh and complimented each other.  I don't want to give away all the chef's secrets but these were just a few of our favorite samplings: the goat cheese stuffed peppadew peppers with honey ginger glaze and carmelized onion and the brioche bread pudding is out of this world.  I think my husband and I will be making this our go-to restaurant in the Charlotte area.  And don't forget to try out the brunch - just as impressive as the tasting!",

    "text": "Outstanding experience last night.  Everything we ordered was delicious and priced appropriately.  The menu is well thought out and varied.  We ordered 3 sides, 1 salad, and split the burger entree.  The duck confit was delicious even compared to our Paris experiences, the mushroom tart was wonderful as well,  How they can impart that much garlicy goodness into the sauteed mushrooms without them shriveling them into raisins is amazing.  Our caeser salad was great especialy with the white anchovies.  The burger was cooked to our liking and they split it onto two plates prior to delivering to us which was a nice touch.  Finally, the peach tart special dessert was insane.  We washed all that down with two cocktails, two glasses of wine and two coffees (with Bailey's).  All for $100 which I though was more than fair.  Our service was outstanding and Elise (co-owner) stopped by and was very genuine in her interaction.  My only real complaint is that the restaurant can get loud very easily due to its open layout but that's a nit when compared to the overall experience.  Finally the location might seem somewhat sketchy at first glance but the parking lot is well lit and is shared with other bars / restaurants so there is plenty of activity in the lot.  We will be back again soon,  and are very excited to try the Sunday brunch as we have heard nothing but great things.",

    "text": "We had heard such good things about Bistro La Bon, that we finally decided to splurge and give it a try for Sunday Brunch this past weekend.  I say \"splurge\" because it's $22 per person. For a buffet.  For breakfast.  No Disney characters included.  Once you've wrapped your head around that, let's move on...  The restaurant is in a strip plaza, so it doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you enter the room, it feels quite cozy.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic.  It reminded us of the long-gone Pewter Rose and Tutto Mondo that used to occupy the space in Dilworth where Tupelo Honey Cafe resides now.    We were informed by our server (who was great) that we could step up to the buffet whenever we were ready, but that certain items from the kitchen were only available upon from request through her: scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, french toast, chocolate waffle, and bacon.  We told her we'd check out the buffet first and then let her know.  The buffet (for $22) looked a bit disappointing.  I was expecting all of these \"grand\" dishes, but there really weren't any.  There was some brisket, swedish meatballs, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruit, salad stuff, pastries, cheese grits, and biscuits and gravy.  There wasn't really anything very breakfasty.  Or anything that really stood out as exceptional.  I tried a little bit of many of the items, though, but we soon noticed that everything from the buffet was basically lukewarm.  Not a single item was HOT.  So, not to sound piggy, we ordered one of each of the five items from the kitchen to share.  Sadly, most of these, too, were just lukewarm.  The eggs benedict looked like it had been sitting out for awhile (it wasn't runny).  The chocolate waffle was delivered sans syrup.  So we borrowed some from the french toast (which was the only decent thing brought out besides the can't-go-wrong bacon).  We then heard EVERY other table around us asking for syrup for their waffles and were told that the waffles aren't served with syrup.  What?  Have the owner and managers tried the chocolate waffles?  They are hard, dry, and room temperature.  They're practically begging for liquid like a person lost in the desert.    I give Bistro La Bon five stars for atmosphere, but they only deserve two stars for their Sunday Brunch buffet.  I wouldn't normally be so critical of a buffet, but when you're charging $22 a head, you'd best deliver some exceptional options, not lukewarm basics that I can get anywhere.  Even Golden Corral peddles their crap piping hot.",

The non-buffet items include French toast, chocolate waffles, scrambled eggs and other treats. I don't drink alcohol so I didn't pay attention to that section of the menu - but I spotted many a server passing out many a mimosa.

I got the jalapeno basil martini - it's a little spicy!  We tried a few bar bites and a couple small plates. The burger is a must have! So delicious. The scallops are fantastic and the octopus is so amazing.",

    "text": "Dinner before Jazz set at The Stage Door. Parking is plentiful as the restaurant is part of a small shopping center. It was a chilly night and there were heaters in the front outdoor area. We were dining early to make the show, so fortunately did not have to wait inside or outside!  I had a drink at the bar while waiting for my friend. The bartender was personable and made a very good martini. This also gave me a chance to ask him about some items on the menu. By the time we sat down, I knew what I wanted.  The small plate Bouillabaisse was arguably the best I have ever had. Not tomatoey -the base was light in feel, but so rich in flavor, fragrant, with distinct flavors. I like that all the vegetable solids had not been strained out, as I savored every tiny bit. The seafood was tender, the shellfish was not overcooked, rather still tender and amazing. Unfortunately, I was so excited about it I used an expletive when our server asked if I liked it. Yikes, sorry...please chalk it up to enthusiasm.   I only wish I could have gotten a BIG BIG dish.  My friend had the mussels and frites. Again, the mussels were tender and delicious and the portion very generous.  Our server was attentive and was the perfect combination of there when we needed her without being intrusive. She did her best to keep our little candle burning, but it was not to be had. My only quasi-negative comment is that without light in our little corner, it was difficult to read the menu and the check, and to see the food as well as I would have liked. It did not ruin our evening or our meal.  I had been here for brunch before and considered it (expletive) amazing - now dinner. And still so many things to come back and try.",

Everything from the waffles covered in chocolate and whip cream, to the meatballs and gravy, was delicious. I thought I would be able to control myself but alas, I left with a bloated, yet happy stomach. GG.  They've done a fantastic job decorating the restaurant, giving it a rustic, homey feel that certainly adds to the enjoyable experience. On top of that, our server was friendly and very well-spoken.  If I'm back in CLT, I will make an excuse to return to Bistro La Bon.",

We ordered a round of cocktails and couple of small plates.    The cocktails were quite nice and left me looking forward to our food and perhaps another drink as I didn't expect the first one to last long.    Then we waited for our food, or some service, or a shred of evidence that we weren't invisible.  And we waited some more... then some more...  45 minutes went by and no one had come by to check on us. None of our food had arrived. My drink had been empty for 25 minutes.  Not a single member of the staff had even looked in our direction.    After several attempts, I was able to Finally flag someone down to get the bill.  I explained the situation.  There was not a single shred of apology.  The bartender who took our order obviously could not have cared less that he had just wasted our time.  I paid my bill (no offer to comp the two drinks) and left as fast as I could.    This is among the worst service that I Ever experienced.  I will Never go back to Bistro La Bon.",

    "text": "I guess it is a 3-star kind of day for me!    I am not going to write a full review because I think to really LOVE this place you have to visit the Sunday Brunch.  I was under the impression the Sunday buffet was also on Saturday so we came here for brunch this past Saturday and were a little disappointed.  The menu was very limited for one thing and nothing stood out as being unique or exciting.  I tried the veggie sandwich that was to be served on cranberry walnut bread with some type of fancy cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, red peppers, onion marmalade and avocado.  Sounds good right?  Well it was good or would have been good but when it came out I was a little confused because it was an open-face sandwich piled high and impossible to eat.  You couldn't pick it up because it was too heavy and sloppy and to use a fork would have been defeating the purpose of having a sandwich--plus cutting into a thick piece of walnut bread wasn't exactly easy.  PLUS--I still couldn't get a taste of everything in one bite regardless.  It was just a mess.  It had great potential but poor execution.  My dining partner ordered the french toast and that is exactly what it was---a piece of french toast.  One piece.  On a high note it did have fresh fruit on top!  However, the syrup was dispersed for you (not offered at the table) and after about 3 bites it vanished.  It was likely a piece of texas toast battered and plated.  Why?    Service was lovely, atmosphere is sexy, quality of food is decent but not satisfying in my opinion.  I would love to come back for the Sunday buffet and I will do that and update this review at that time!  Until then....don't go there for brunch on a Saturday---go right on down the street to zada janes and get MORE bang for your buck!!!  Please and thank you.",

They have large buffet selection that includes mac n cheese, pastries, fruits, grits and meat options to say a few. They will also make and bring waffles, french toast and egg benedict to your table. It is all inclusive for only $22. Atmosphere is bohemian and our server was very sweet. Highly highly recommended!",

Great deal for a great price  Parking is available in the Bistro La Bon parking lot which is shared with stores.  The waitress was very helpful with suggestions on what to order.   For the appetizer, I ordered the spicy shrimp and chorizo with the help of our waitress.  I was hesitant due to the spicy description but our waitress assured us it was not too spicy.  I'm so happy I listened to her because the shrimp was delicious  and not at all spicy. This appetizer was perfectly seasoned and the chorizo was delicious. 5/5  I ordered Pan seared Trout with blackened shrimp skewers, organic carrot puree, roasted fingerling potatoes, hariot vets almandine, lemon thyme butter. Definitely give this entree a 5/5   For dessert I order the bourbon binoche bread pudding. Jim Bean soaked, caramel with vanilla gelato. This was hit with my friends and I. It wasnt hot like I prefer but it was delicious.  4/5",

    "text": "Charlotte Classic  Don't know why we have not been back but it's been a number of years since we have been here but just probably overlooked. Used to be a favorite of my late Sister-in-Law.  In all candor, this was not our original destination because there is a new restaurant called Snooze that just opened across the street we wanted to try but when they told us the wait was between 90 and 120 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere,  Did not take much to decide where to go because Bistro La Bon is just across the street.  On Saturday, they have a brunch from about 10 to 2:30 and then close and reopen for dinner later. No breakfast and no lunch menu but an abbreviated brunch menu.  Dropped my wife off at the front door while I parked the car. Apparently she was promptly seated because she was already at the table when I walked in a couple of minutes later.  Our server gave us the menus and took our beverage orders in good order. Excellent service. Very attentive but not intrusive and gave you the opportunity to dine in peace.  The Saturday Brunch Menu is somewhat abbreviated and from what I remembered from the Sunday Brunch, somewhat smaller but something for everyone.  I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict which comes with the house fries.  My wife order the Pyttipanna which is a brisket and kielbasa bowl with onions and other goodies.  The Crab Cake Benedict was very good and the house fries were unexpected being cooked up with onions and peppers and a bit of heat.  My wife is from Pittsburgh and goes for anything with Kielbasa even though she is not Polish.  Service as mentioned was excellent and the food was both creative and delicious and the presentation was also excellent.  Atmosphere is great with a touch of Europe.  This has been a Charlotte Classic for a good while and remains so and we will be back. Don't know why we have not been back recently but that will be something that we will rectify.",

However, the brunch buffet at Bistro la Bon is the antidote to this feeling. The buffet is filled with both breakfast and lunch options, including plenty of healthy veggies for a vegetable loving omnivore like myself. And the added touch of unlimited family style breakfast items like their eggs Benedict and chocolate waffles are a real crowd pleaser. It's not super cheap, but you absolutely get what you pay for.",

The Caesar wedge was great although the dressing is a little runnier and not the thick creamy Caesar I was dreaming of. We went salad crazy and also ordered the burrata and the iceberg wedge. The iceberg wedge was good, but not mind-blowing. I wish there was more bacon because that was my favorite part. The burrata was our favorite of the salads.  We ordered a couple more small plates: the ahi tuna tartare and the shrimp and chorizo. The shrimp and chorizo is primarily shrimp and limited on the chorizo part, which was a little bit of a bummer, but it was still delish! The ahi tuna tartare was flavorful but the only thing holding it back from being outstanding was that the tuna was still pretty frozen. That was kind of a bummer.  Overall, we were pleased & would still be likely to return. The restaurant is accommodating (lots of gluten free options, etc) and the service was wonderful.",

I got there after 6pm during happy hour to partake in their $6 specialty cocktail features. Upon entering, it was not busy; which is a plus for me. I like to be attended to so when it's busy; that one on one attention isn't guaranteed.    I started with the Jalapeno Basil Martini, definitely has a kick with extra spice. Next was the Midwood Cosmo with grapefruit liqueur and cranberry drizzled in. To me, it's more of an end the night cocktail.   For food, I tried their best seller the Seafood Mac and Cheese. It was soooooo good. Just imagine someone taking small bites just to savor the flavors of the sauce..lobster reduction may I add...yep that was me. I didn't think it was going to be good, but it was Good.   To end the evening, I had the Cucumber Gimlet. It was quite refreshing.   Overall, the experience was nice. Definitely a go to for an after work evening, hard day or just because. I will be back pretty soon.",

I went here for my birthday about a year ago. It is a really lovely setting, bohemian furniture and soft lighting creating a romantic ambience. A good mix of high end foods, small or shareable plates and large plates. Like the chicken breast with banana nut bread, weird paring but it was delicious.   My family went here recently for brunch and there was a massive line, but I heard how great it was so we still went. The host said that we could sit at this communal table even though there was this giant line. So of course we sat. This communal table at the front could probably sit about 16 plus people but instead there are 8 giant barstools. My family and the group that took up the offer right behind us all thought the barstools were for 2 people, but there was a table setting for only one. Complete waste of space and uncomfortable that we weren't sat like a normal restaurant.   Also none of us received menus, I knew it was a buffet. But (1) I didn't know the price and (2) I figured you would be able to order off the menu as well bc the dinner is kind of formal. So after sitting for awhile and never being greeted I go up and looked at the pitiful buffet. First of all almost everything was empty and nothing looked fresh. Second there were no vegetarian options other than fruit and salad. Third it was smaller than a budget inn's continental breakfast. So whatever the price is for the buffet it is not worth it.  I was let down and frustrated and we left.",

Figured why the heck now, if it's a horrible spot we'll at least get a Mimosa in us lol.   The hostess welcomed us so already off to a good start. We were told there was a short wait so we let the hostess know that we were going to the bar to wait. Unbeknownst to us, the hostess actually thought we were also eating at the bar so we sat at the bar longer than we expected. Luckily it wasn't packed so we cleared up the misunderstanding with hostess and we were off to the races.  Our waitress was the coolest person which besides the $3 Mimosas, great food and damn near perfection on the service she would be a reason I would come back again and again. Literally took our order and me/finacee was having not the most appropriate conversation and she chimed in with some whimsical responses which made our day.  The decor feels very French to me but I'm no decorator but it felt homey. Anyway it's a great spot, if you e read through all of this take my advice and try Bistro you won't regret it.",

To kick off Restaurant Week, I made reservations for 4. The menu options available during Restaurant Week sounded great and I was looking forward to finally being able to check it out.  After being seated we ordered cocktails and some bread to start.  After checking out the menu we placed our order.  Between the four of us, we had a great variety of items and sampled each other's. Definite highlights of the night were the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and the Filet. How do they make the Brussel Sprouts so Crispy yet cooked tender, perfection! The ambiance is very nice, trendy with an intimate feel.  Service was spot on. Overall Bistro La Bon will definitely be on my list for dinner again, and I will have to check out their brunch, because I've heard and seen, in Yelp reviews, how great it is.",

We were able to walk right in around 8:00pm on a Saturday and we were sat immediately. I will say the tables were a little close together. The man and I would normally go for the two seats closest to the window (at a four person table) but the tables next had people sitting in that spot at their respective tables and it would have been uncomfortable to try shimmy over. I am glad we didn't come as a group of four.   Our waitress was friendly and had our food out impressively quick from the kitchen. We had the amazing seafood mac and cheese which was my favorite with gooy cheese and plenty of shrimp. The light addition of truffle oil put the dish into the outstanding category. We also had the octopus which was a bit overcooked, but was served with a great complimentary ratatouille. The swedish meatballs (3) were much better than the Ikea brand and since my fiance was quite taken with them I let him have the odd meatball out. We finished with the madras mussels which were delicious, and my fiance may have taken spoonfuls of the broth after all the mussels had been consumed. It was that good.  I love the decor inside with heavy tapestries and an open kitchen. This is definitely a great date spot for people like me who love ordering tapas and splitting everything. They also have signature dishes which I assume is a main course offering for the selfish souls who can't vibe with a tapas menu.",

Three of us were expected to share one piece of paper that said \"bacon and eggs\" at the top and the rest of the page was beverages.  My water glass was dirty and when the waiter finally came he said we could order from the kitchen (order WHAT?) or enjoy the buffet. No other papers or menus were provided and when we asked what was on the buffet he told us we had to go back outside to read the list on the door because they don't bother to print the contents of the buffet since its SEASONAL and changes so much. I was only interested in the buffet contents right then, not Christmas, next week or even 2 hours later.  A request for a menu of what could be ordered from the kitchen met with a sigh and a very quick verbal description of 4 or 5 things.   If you're into guessing what the goop on the buffet is, having to weave through a stream of buffet-goers back outside past the snitty hostesses to read todays \"seasonal\" buffet list off the door, or having to write a list of what can be ordered from the kitchen on your napkin so you can decide, go on and get you some.   We left without tasting a thing. I'll never go back.",

There are tables outside that promise fun dining when the weather is better. Course one: beet salad. Very good. Course two: mussels. Fantastic! A bit of zing to the sauce. Course three: Swedish meatballs. Beautifully presented, but nothing special in terms of flavor. Course four: bread pudding. Very good but more like French toast than any bread pudding I have ever had. Now we come to the more negative part of the review. We finished at 9 pm. Yes, 5:30 to 9 pm. The intervals between courses were very long. The course were delivered by people other than our server, whom we rarely saw. The place was full. However, there appeared to be plenty of staff so I suspect it was the kitchen that was having trouble keeping up. The food was good enough that I'd be willing to try it again, but the slow service was a definite negative and came close to spoiling the evening.",

I am a college student, so I can't really afford to eat here regularly, but I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary and it was brilliant. The service staff was friendly, we were greeted by both the hostess and the bartender at the front, and despite being fully booked even to the lounge area out service was prompt and precise.  The Swedish meatballs are phenomenal, and the Brie Brulee is nothing short of an orgasm for your pallet.  The only issue we had all night was that our waitress, although friendly, was pushing a bit too hard to sell us the more expensive items.  It took us saying that we were underage to get her to stop pushing their third most expensive bottle of wine.  Other than that minor issue, there are not many places in the city at which I would rather eat than Bistro.",

    "text": "I have been to Bistro three times; once for dinner, second brunch and last a surprise birthday party for my girlfriend--the last being the best experience yet.  I contacted Bistro and inquired about hosting a party between 20 and 25 on a Friday night.  They were able to accommodate and so I started planning.  The chef called me to discuss the cake, twice (the second with a variation of his first idea).  I, and others, have dietary restrictions preventing us from partaking; however, it was beautiful and others noted it tasted fantastic.  I give Bistro four stars.  The food is good, the atmosphere wonderful, and they did an outstanding job helping me with my girlfriend's birthday party.  While the menu is not extensive, my only critique is fewer vegetable choices than I might like (never the less, they were able to accommodate my heavy dietary restrictions).  I've always received great service, be it the host, serving staff or chef.  I definitely will recommend this to others, and for any number of occasions.",

Not the case here.  Every time I have brunch I'm starving by the time we enter the restaurant.  Bistro La Bon delivered with instant gratification.  We were seated and asked if we would like a chocolate waffle or french toast, and if we want fresh eggs and bacon.  We answered yes, yes, yes, and yes.  The waffles and french toast were both out of this world.  I'm a chocolate person, but I still may lean more towards the french toast it was that good.  The bacon was a good thickness and mix between crunchy and chewy.  The eggs were scrambled and good, but I do wish there was more egg options there.  The buffet would be really enhanced by a benedict.  Below is the breakdown of the buffet:  Great:  meatballs, potatoes au gratin, fresh fruit, apple pastry Good:  braised beef, sweet potato hash, sausage and cabbage, pasta salad Meh:  salad   I will definitely be back.  Hopefully I'll be surprised with something new on the buffet that wasn't there before.",

The ambience of the restaurant is nice and definitely not anticipated given the location. The waiter was courteous, but the service overall was average. After sitting down and having ordered and received our appetizers, the waiter more or less disappeared for about 30 minutes.   We waited for our food for almost an hour. After pointing that out to the manager, he proceeded to assure us that it has not been an hour. Well, ok, 55 minutes do qualify as an hour when you are waiting for food at 9 pm. First rule of customer services is a restaurant: don't argue with your customer. Second rule: the customer is always right.   When the food arrived the portions were ok, but a little larger portions would have been appropriate. From the time that the first plate arrived at our table to the time that the last of our party received their food over 5 minutes passed.   I had the salmon, which was good, but nothing to write home about. The presentation was good, but overall the food was not very creative or outstanding in terms of taste.   Considering the overall experience and the prices on the menu, there are definitely places in Charlotte that have better customer service, more interesting and innovative food, and are just an overall better experience.   Pass.",

My other favorites include the delicious lemon dill vinaigrette dressing over the salad, the beef brisket (melt in your mouth tenderness), the pumpkin cheesecake muffins and the highly addictive fresh homemade coconut macaroons. They are truly perfection w/ the right amount of chewy sweet goodness. I would highly suggest reservations for Sunday brunch. Think I will go this Sunday..:)",

Tasting was held on couches nestled near the front door. We ordered a charcuterie plate and it was excellent but it was overpriced for the amount of food on it. There was no cheese or bread served with it. A huge white platter held the miniscule amount of meat.  As we say in  advertising, good use of white space. They need to beef up the amount of food on their platters or get smaller platters. Service there was excellent. A few tweaks and they'd get a 5 star rating from me.",

The wine list makes me happy and has plenty of options for ordering by the glass.  The coffee has me asking \"why does the coffee at my house not taste this good?\"  The food is worth coming back to try more of.  I've never thought of Swedish meatballs as anything special, but they're a highlight of the menu, as is the flourless chocolate cake.  And there was some kind of squid-ink risotto thing that I'm remembering fondly now, too.  And despite what some of the other reviews say, this stretch of Central is far from the seediest place you'll ever have to park in Charlotte.  You'll be quite safe.",

    "text": "4.5, but worth it to round up.  If there's one thing you learn about Charlotte, it's not judging the merit of a business by its cover.  There are good restaurants in all kinds of shabby disguises here.  One of a few businesses in a strip mall type place near a Family Dollar, it would be very easy to just drive past La Bon in an effort to get to some of the more externally flashy, colorful places down Central. If it is a Sunday morning, that move would be a mistake. This was the kind of brunch buffet experience where I sat down with a plate of food and literally had to catch my breath because I couldn't seem to stop myself.  Everything we tasted was very good.  Superb standouts were the French toast, seasonal veggies, gratin potatoes, sweet potato hash and beef brisket. My husband's instinct is to wrinkle his nose at a 16$ brunch buffet but he had the same issue I had - inability to stop fork from going from plate to mouth over and over again.  He said it was possibly the best brunch he's ever had.  I'd say it was definitely the best I've had in Charlotte, and one of the best I've had period.  I'm telling you, I went from my current baby bump shape to a big old preggy belly shape in the course of an hour. The decor is comfortable and classy.  Service was pleasant and present so we had no issues there.  We went right after 10 AM when the place opens, so the big brunch crowd wasn't there yet but there was still some congestion at the buffet.  So the only thing detracting from a perfect is the slightly small size of the buffet.  I don't need more variety - focusing on a small set of offerings is probably part of why everything here is good - but more space would help. Bon appetit, bros.",

I went with my mom this past Saturday, and after checking out some reviews on here I decided to order the french toast and a side of bacon. I normally am an english muffin, bagel type of girl and don't go for the sweet stuff but their french toast was great! The bread was a good combination of soft and crusty, the fruit was fresh (blueberries, strawberries, bananas) and the cream on top was just the right amount of sweetness. The bacon was crisp (just the way I like it). Oh and of course I had a Mimosa because again I was having breakfast with my mom (kidding, love you) which was great. I would suggest trying them out for Breakfast as well as one of the nights they pair various wines with some of their cuisines.",

The service was horrendous ....if Ashleigh is your server....change tables ....she is rude....condescending.....opinionated ....unlikable....the food however....once you get it is really really good.  I think the chef genuinely has a passion for excellence however the overall experience suffers due to poor poor rude service (Ashleigh)......change your profession .....we had 8:00 reservations and at 9:20 were told by Ashleigh that we could not order yet because of a kitchen back-up..... A member of our group approached the chef to ask about the delay and within minutes we were served a number of delicious dishes......why have waitresses when you can order directly from the chef .....he was fantastic btw.....after our $500 bill which included a huge tip for Ashleigh we told each other that Bistro La Bon is definitively off our list .....sorry chef......front of the house service unfortunately leaves the biggest impression .......au revoir  Bistro La Bon!!!!!!",

The scallops were great, the creme' brulee was the best I have ever had. My friend had great tips and chocolate cake, which she raved about. Service was great, waitress was accommodating and it had a pleasant atmosphere. I have been recommending it everywhere!",

The drinks were weak and when I asked to speak to the manager, he clearly thought I was crazy for complaining. He was confrontational, unhelpful and tried to embarrass me by saying that I was the only customer who had ever complained. . Both experiences were way below average - Plenty of Brunch options in Charlotte, I will skip Bistro La Bon.",

OK, so now I've been there almost 10 times (or have I?) and I can officially say it deserves 5 stars.  Yes, every item on the brunch buffet is great and their bread pudding might be the most incredible dessert ever.  It's also a really cool place to hang out (good bar and drink choices, comfy couches).  The hostesses and bartenders are super nice.  I like to tell my South Charlotte friends how great it is and then watch them wet their pants when they see where it's located (in a strip mall next to a Family Dollar).  But they all recognize the greatness and location quickly becomes a non-issue.  If this place were to ever shut down, I would die.",

Served in a comfortable and gracious environment.   You may have dined here for their famous brunch buffet. I implore you to try them for dinner.   For an extra special good time:  1. Sit in the spacious bar area. Many tables and several couches. The couches are where it's at.   2. $6 cocktails on Wednesdays. And yes they even ran that special on New Year's Eve.   3. Snag a handful of bar bites. These offerings are a teensy tiny bit smaller than the small plates served in the dining room but a couple bucks cheaper. You won't be missing out.   4. If it's on the menu- Try lamb belly, tuna tartare, lavender chicken (it's often listed as a main too and the best chicken you'll ever order out), their mussels are divine and the grilled octopus is on point.   Oh yeah, the bread pudding is worth it. It's the bar I compare all bread puddings too. Perfect way to end a meal.",

They have a kale salad that I get with grilled chicken, and it is perfectly prepared every time I go. The atmosphere is good for dates, the service is attentive, and the price is reasonable given the high quality of the food. It's clear that the kitchen takes pride in their work.   The only reason it's not five stars has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but the rash of violent crime in the area recently. A couple was robbed and shot in the parking lot, another young woman was shot and killed nearby and several others have been robbed. Last time we were there the police had a tower in the parking lot, which I'm sure helps, but it's a shame such a good place is being hurt by their location.",

    "text": "I came here for their raved about Sunday brunch. And sadly for my taste, it was a very big let down. While walking inside and enjoying their decor was very eye popping and intriguing, their food was \"meh.\"  They serve about 12 dishes (7 hot dishes) and they also have chocolate waffles and french toast. The waffles, toast, and eggs with bacon have to be ordered so the waiter brings them out. (No worries, they're part of the buffet)  So why 2 stars? Here are the problems I felt uncomfortable with...  1. $18 a pop?! I mean come on the variety of food isn't that extensive at the same time I felt as if none of the dishes popped out to me as absolutely amazing. I believe that 18 for brunch I paid for was presentation of food...  2. The service - it was okay, I mean I did expect a little more. The cups I drank water out of was lets say, a little smelly? The waiters use rags to wipe the glass cups down, and well I think that's what makes glasses smelly.  3. The food - as mentioned before, the food was okay. But the price of the brunch and the materials of the food didn't make sense. Think about it, Swedish meatballs one of their raved about dishes... Everyone compares it to Ikea, yes it's better but the price of it doesn't make sense. Probably the most expensive plate is the \"smoked\" salmon. To me, I didn't feel like that salmon was really smoked at the same time there was no taste in it (maybe because I didn't add the extra flavors to the salmon?)  However, even these reasons are some of the reasons why this restaurant turn me off off..others can see why this restaurant is good. One thing I did notice is that all their food is really healthy. Their dishes didn't have that much oil, their most unhealthy dish is probably the brisket because of the fat. That, to me could probably make their prices a little more, but still I don't still quite believe it would be that much.  Anyways, for me I rather go eat a vietnamese brunch on a Sunday spending a lot less for more variety and at the same time the healthy option is there for me to choose. Overall, I had a positive experience, but sadly this restaurant isn't quite my scene and brunch wise wasn't so great.",

    "text": "My first visit will be my last. It was supposed to be a special dinner for two. The first thing that caught my attention was that the wait staff was a little bit under-groomed. The menu was not exciting as I had expected and had heard about. The server told us the specials. The server stated they had a 'Surf and Turf special which is a filet mignon with a lobster tail served on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes'. It was the only thing either of us thought stood out  I asked the price expecting between $30 - 40. The server had to check and returned telling us it was $46! It was way overpriced comparatively, esp. considering the location and this was not formal dining.   It was a special evening, so I figured I won't worry about the price. We both ordered the Surf and Turf. As the server approached with our food, my blood immediately began to boil. On top of the filets, looked like one large shrimp popping out of both of our meals. It was shocking to see a tiny piece of lobster sticking out of an EMPTY lobster tail shell. Not only was the lobster tail shell small, but most of the meat had been removed. it wasn't possible to be that much smaller than the shell it was in.   I opted to eat my lobster in two small bites instead of one medium bite. Basically It was like cutting a shrimp in half. The lobster 'popper' was too small to comment on. The filet mignon was cooked very well, but it was bland. The garlic mashed potatoes were bland. There were two asparagus sprigs for garnish.   I just resolved myself to never going there again and did not complain to the staff since it was a special dinner and I figured any restaurant that would gouge and cheat their customers that way is not worth my time or my future business. I just cut my losses for the sake of the evening. It would have been a very awkward conversation regardless of it being a special night out.",

In 2018 though, it is obvious something has drastically changed in the food quality and the way they address the menu. This was the first year they offered a limited menu, in the past you could order off of the regular menu which is one of the reasons we always go there. We did not ask, so shame on us for booking the reservation without asking, we had assumed it would be the same. The limited menu featured 4 options, each with a 4 course serving for 70.00 a person.  I choose the halibut and my wife and friends choose the filet, which was nothing like the filet they had in the past. It seemed to be more of a bone in rib eye steak. The cut was different, it was a huge piece of meat which was not nearly as tender as usual. My halibut was pan seared to death, hard and dried up. The entrees and apps were of very large portions, too large in my opinion. It seems obvious they are focusing on quantity and not quality.  Our server was nice enough, fairly attentive. Not nearly as experienced as servers in the past though. She did not offer up one description of any menu item or make any suggestions. More of an order filler than a higher end server. I would expect this at many places, but this is one of the details that made Bistro what it was in the past. After all, this isn't Fridays.  The final nail in the coffin was the ever so famous bread pudding, which I had been looking forward to. Again, the recipe had changed, it was dried out and not nearly the same as in years past. I don't know if they have changed chefs, but this was disappointing to say the least. With drinks, tip and meals my wife and I spent over 200.00 for dinner, all for food and service that was average at best. I cannot say we have much interest in trying it again, which is sad because it is our tradition.",

    "text": "I've been trying to get to Bistro La Bon for brunch since December. When Graham and I were going to bed Friday night it dawned on me that we had no plans for Saturday morning, so I decided that we needed to have brunch. I hopped on Open Table and made a reservation. The restaurant is over on a side of town that was always pretty shady when I was a kid. So it's very cool to see it being revitalized and filling up with excellent, local places.  Graham and I started with cocktails. I had a $3 mimosa and he had a bloody mary. Their bloody mary bar is pretty awesome. You pick the vodka, and choose from a variety of mixers and add-ins. I had never had a bloody mary before, so I had a sip of his. I took one sip and promptly realized I don't care for them and would be sticking with mimosas.  Graham had a breakfast that was, in his words, \"a vegans nightmare\". This was two eggs, a potato cake, and steaks with carmelized onions and bernaise sauce. This breakfast made me wish I liked runny eggs, because this looked so, so good. I did try the steak though, and it (and the sauce) was so delicious.  His breakfast had nothing on my french toast. This was a huge piece of brioche, fresh fruit, syrup and orange zest. This was sweet, delicious and filling. I typically don't like syrup on my french toast, but with the fruit and the hint of orange flavor, it really worked. I would order this again and again. I did order a side of bacon (un-pictured), which was just okay. It was thick, but wasn't crispy at all.  The server was a little slack (it took way to long for her to return with drinks and to take our orders, since there were only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant, but whatever. She was friendly and our food was delicious.",

    "text": "Well, that was a mistake. I thought I would just pop in for a nice and light meal, making a healthy choice for a late breakfast. It's a \"bistro\" so they should have light stuff, right?  Well, it turns out that on Sunday, Bistro La Bon does a huge spread for a brunch buffet. And since I simply can't resist a buffet, I ended up \"forgetting\" my plan for a light meal and ended up stuffing my face with a couple plates of absolutely excellent food.  I don't know if they rotate out the meals, so your spread might be different. I had hand-rolled mozzarella, Swedish meatballs, beef brisket (a little salty, but tender), smoked salmon, hand-made sliced ciabbata bread, yummy potato salad and a pile of Caesar salad. Oh, but there's more. In the kitchen, they hide the hot foods and they are all included with your buffet. So I also had some scrambled eggs (fluffy!) and bacon, a chocolate waffle (I only had half) and the topper, a slice of French toast that was topped with real (not canned!) whipped cream and powdered sugar and syrup.  So much for light, eh?  I opted to sit at the bar and so I had excellent service. A really good deal at $24 or so with tip.",

But foodies in the CLT know a terrific restaurant, and an even better Sunday brunch, no matter where the eatery may be.  I like the cozy, intimate decor. Plenty of Persian-style rugs line the hardwoods, and the lighting and atmosphere lends itself to conversation and laughs. It's a terrific place to bring a date or a group of friends and family for a great meal.  The Sunday brunch is Bistro La Bon's raison d'etre. Keep in mind the buffet is rather small, so if you're expecting a Golden Corral-sized DIY helpings, you'll be slightly disappointed.  I love that your buffet serving also comes with complimentary scrambled eggs, chocolate waffles, thick-cut bacon AND buttery french toast. For real. And, yes, they are complimentary. They say such nice things about me...(*groan*)  One thing to watch out for: if you love your Bloody Marys drowned in Tabasco, then you'll love 'em here. Me, I like 'em not so spicy. I struggled mightily trying to finish mine, but I simply threw in the towel. No shame in admitting I don't have enough hair on my chest to finish this spicy bastard. So I opted instead for a Mimosa. Yeah, whatever. Don't you judge me.  So for what it's worth, BLB is fast becoming one of my go-to spots for Sunday brunch. In fact, I may need to drag the missus and the wee wonder this Sunday...",

We shared a smorgasbord of small plates, including mussels in a creamy saffron broth, selection of house cured meats and cheeses, mozzarella and smoked eggplant tapenade, and the lamb wellington.  All of it was outstanding.  My only disappointment is that they no longer carry the duck confit small plate!   Since I was pretty full off of appetizers, I just snagged a couple bites of my boyfriend's filet, which comes with a potato gratin that is perfectly sweet, salty, and creamy. This steak is better than any steak I've ever had at Del Frisco's or The Palm. The seasonings give a nice, flavorful crunch.  I'm impressed!",

I am re-reviewing and giving Bistro La Bon a low rating for the reason that we were very dissappointed with the food after I had given the restaurant 5 stars about a year ago. The menu have changed. Yes, I know and expect restaurants to change their menu to reflect change in seasonal produce, etc. The portions of the tapas have gotten smaller. Yes, I know tapas are small plates. However, we felt the dishes were way over-priced for the portion and quality. Our bill for 3 ppl (only one alcoholic drink) was close to $150 and my husband was still hungry afterwards. The waiter did bring us a complimentary 2nd plate of lamb shank because he said the first plate of one lamb shank was small. Side note- we did not complain at all, the waiter brought it out on his own initiative. Even with a free plate, Bistro is not worth it for us to drive over there. Sorry. My son remembered how great their seared scallop dish was so we ordered a scallop dish. Scallops were smaller size this time around.",

The brunch is obviously a huge favorite. It overwhelms me. I won't lie- I'm not a big buffet person. I end up binging on EVERYTHING. I feel ill and guilty after it. These are my own issues. No one else seems to mind- it is always busy for brunch (THEY ALSO HAVE A SATURDAY BREAKFAST- hard to find). Apparently, there is a lunch buffet now. I might check that out after summer.  Recommendation: just sit at the bar area. You don't need to go into the restaurant. The bar area is nice because you can laugh loudly without feeling like you are interrupting a date. They always have some sort of drink special. The small plates are really good- especially the asparagus. The bread pudding is delicious. Really, everything is good.  I don't normally like to have dinners with more than 4 people (6 tops). This is one of the few restaurants that I have had a large dinner with successfully. That is a skill.  I love that La Bon gives back to the community.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place 5 stars but I cannot.  I have been a customer for years and have eaten here for Sunday brunch as well as dinner.  The vibe here is very cool, the staff, mainly attractive men in their 20's are all dressed in all black, the lighting is very dim and the decor is very chic with a coffee house style couch seating and table in the center for waiting.  Back in the day the chef and the owner would come to your table to ask how things were, this has not happened for some time.  This used to be my regular Sunday brunch place, however, after trying to make reservations online several times and seeing them full, I experimented by changing the number in my party, trying different Sundays, over a month out to no avail.  I called and was told they no longer take reservations for Sunday brunch.  Well, I will no longer dine here for Sunday brunch.  This place is PACKED!!  There are many large groups and if you are sitting near one, it is like trying to have a conversation in a night club.  Without a reservation, you have an hour or so to wait.  Even with a reservation, I always had to wait 15 minutes. They serve breakfast on Saturday and will take reservations then, but the buffet is not served, only items off the menu.    I always took out of town guests here and they enjoyed it.  Reservation frustration aside, the quality has gone down significantly. My family members who come once or twice a year noticed it also and asked me to find another place for brunch.  I guess this is what happens when the word about a hidden gem reaches the masses.    For Sunday brunch they bring scrambled eggs, bacon, and french toast for the table to share.  The last two times I was there I had to ask for the Belgium chocolate waffles, apparently they are not just brought to you anymore unless you request them. They are very rich and almost like a dessert item so if you have 4 people it is not necessary to ask for 4 of these.  For a table of 4, we had one slice of french toast, a half of one small waffle, 4 slices of bacon and a couple tablespoons of eggs.  The portions have shrunk, as previously they really would give you enough for 4 people, for example 4 slices of french toast.  Speaking of the french toast the the french toast is the BEST ever!  At least that has not changed.  But they have hardly any syrup on them so you need to ask for more. I think this could be part of the problem, having to ask for all these things at what is almost a buffet, slows things down causing significant delays for a table. The buffet is wonderful, delicious pastries, Swedish meatballs, potatoes Au gratin, grits, fruit, brisket, a variable selection of items. These are mostly lunch items since the breakfast items are served at the table.    Dinner here is fairly expensive.  A great place to try for restaurant week.  The conversation is not as loud here as during brunch but for some reason they were playing this loud music which made it difficult to talk. The menu changes so it is hard to comment on entrees but the desserts have been pretty consistent.  I highly recommend the flourless chocolate cake which is sinfully rich and the bread pudding which is made from the same to-die-for bread that they use on their french toast. Parking has become increasingly difficult in one of those horrible zig zag parking lots, but at least there are places to park unlike Zada Janes across the street.",

(I should be an expert on the topic of mediterian food being half Italian, half Lebanese and having an Egyptian born mother.)  The atmosphere, and service is great and you wont believe the price once you taste how amazing the food is!  This place is one of my top 5 favorites in Charlotte.",

It seemed like I waited forever for the french toast and bacon to come out.  And once I got it... I wasn't pleased with the quality.  It was just mediocre.  From the buffet, I had their watered down cheese grits and their not so fresh watermelon.  The items that I thought was okay at the buffet was the biscuits with white gravy and their Mac and cheese.  Typically their buffet is $20 but for Fathers Day...I paid $30.  And it was a complete waste of money.  I don't think that I would ever come back here.  Sorry Bistro La Bon, I'm just not that into you.",

    "text": "We actually started out at Midwood Smokehouse this day as we were craving some cue for lunch but a 30 minute wait coupled with my wife's work schedule sent us, Frogger-style, across Central Ave. to Bistro La Bon.  First off, a much larger space than what you would think looking at the place from the outside.  The decor is a little dark and pseudo ornate for my tastes but, I was there for the food and it was pretty good!    I started with potato/poblano soup that was pureed to a velvety texture, had just the right amount of heat to it and frankly was the best potato soup I've ever had.  For lunch entrees my wife and friend split the smoked salmon BLT while I opted for the roasted trout.  These selections led to a little humor...  The salmon eaters didn't ask what type of smoked salmon it was, e.g. hot smoked where it is \"cooked\" and dry or cold smoked where it is kinda raw-esque and moist.  Guess which kind they don't like?  Guess which kind was on the BLT?  Oh to see the looks on their faces when the cold smoked variety was laid down in front of them!  My wife gave it the old college try and ate half of hers.  Friend?  Not so much!  She choked down the first bite looking as if she would hurl and then I offered for the third time to switch plates with her.  Third time was the charm.  So, allow me to comment on BOTH lunch entrees!  The trout was a smallish filet cooked properly and covered with a Mediterranean flavored tomato sauce.  It was good, not great.  The BLT however was excellent.  The bread was a lightly toasted, slightly sweet walnut variety, the bacon was smokey and very plentiful, the tomato and greens were very fresh and the salmon was perfectly smoked and moist.  I would definitely order it again.  Other items coming out of the kitchen past our table looked yummy, especially the cheeseburger.  That may be my choice next visit and yes, there will be a next!",

I hit the Sunday brunch buffet (which is pricey, but worth the occasional splurge) and enjoyed fresh fruit slices, asiago grits, jalapeno mac n cheese, potato au gratin, cheeses and breads and pastries. As a vegetarian, I was disappointed by their roasted beets and roasted veggies...may taste better if they were grilled first then roasted...or anything to make them a bit more tender. Also, the brioche french toast was like a brick and quite overwhelming in flavor.   All in all, a lovely experience with loads of variety. Gonna go back for their late night bar bites.",

Both times visiting my girlfriend and I have only eaten on the large couches up front so I can't speak to specifics of the formal dining area however I would recommend any small party of 2 to 4 eat up in the front or bar area.  From outside looking into the formal dining area I think the bar or front lounge is just more relaxing and entertaining of an environment to dine.  The food here is just superb.  The meat and cheeses and all the small plates are divine.  The peppadew (sp) is probably my favorite.  It has just the right amount of heat and spice and is surprisingly filling.  The wine specifically is affordable which is nice if you're not trying to break the bank on dinner.    The staff is very polite and always attentive.",

This is a must; it is so smooth and the heat of the Jalapeno hits the back of your throat.  For out first two small plates we ordered the CRISPY AVOCADO & ASPARAGUS SPRING ROLL. They were perfectly fried and the Sweet Chili Tamarind Balsamic sauce is the perfect accompaniment. Also we ordered the 9 FRIED BRUSSELS with a Parsnip & Pear Veloute Sauce, another great plate. For our second round we had the BUTTERNUT SQUASH LASAGNA with Caramelized Mushrooms. This is another great small plate and our third time having it. Also came the PAN SEARED POTATO GNOCCHI set on a Parmesan Cream with Spinach & Mushrooms. The aroma hit us before the plate arrived. The Gnocchi were perfectly seared and the sauce was amazing. For our fifth plate we decided to again try the GRILLED SPANISH OCTOPUS with a Roasted Eggplant, Tomato, Squash and Pepper Ragu. The two pieces of Octopus were nicely grilled but were extremely chewy so we had to trim of the skin and suction cups to make it edible. I have had this dish at several other restaurants and they were tender and juicy. I will not give this one another try. For dessert we had the BRIOCHE BOURBON BREAD PUDDING with a Housemade Caramel Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream. This is a must to finish off your dining experience.",

The personal entree made to order helps to keep you feeling like you're eating at a nice bistro rather than a regular buffet restaurant.

Typically I steer clear of buffet lines at all cost, but Bistro la Bon is the rare exception. I found myself making multiple trips to try a little of every item they serve. They refill the dishes often so you get the freshest of all! Not everything is on the buffet line: the french toast, eggs, bacon, and chocolate waffles are made to order and brought directly to your table. Get the french toast...they melt in your mouth!  You can find fabulous raisin scones (beware, if you are too overjoyed and squeeze them too hard they will burst all over you and draw attention in your direction), the apple pastry is oh-so-good, and the freshly grilled veggies are delightful. Pair the veggies with Swedish meatballs and the sausage and you've got yourself a healthy meal! I can go on and on!!  Like others have noted, it's in the most unassuming place ever, but is completely a foodie's haven. Treat your tastebuds to brunch because you deserve the best!",

It was about 50 degrees with a strong breeze, cold. We were not dressed appropriately to eat outside. They weakly said there was one heater in the corner. We said we would wait for an inside table. We definitely had inconvenienced them by changing their plans. When you make the reservation they should tell you will be eating outside so you can dress right. We waited about 20 mins past our time which was ok. We then went into the area with tables. They had jammed in so many extra chairs and tables so tight you could barely maneuver.  We had to wait for people and servers to move to get through; way too tight for people getting up and down for a buffet. My daughter sat down in an old tattered chair that had a screw sticking out the back which ripped her dress. We let the server know what happened and WE quickly rearranged the chairs so no further damage would be done. The food was decent, but definitely not worth the price of the buffet. Eggs Benedict was wonderful per my hubby and made to order items were better than buffet. The poor server carving the lamb and ham sliced off the meat and then served it to you with his gloved fingers, really!  He had a carving fork there but I guess he felt serving with his hands was better. He was mutilating the meat and had no clue what to do. Please give him some guidance. Gross way to serve food! Our server was awesome and kept our drinks full and made to order items coming timely.  She said the manager would come see us about the ripped dress. I even gave them another opportunity to say something or compensate for the tattered dress but NO ONE ever came over to apologize outside of the server. We left and wont be back.  They need to fix their eclectic old garage sale chairs so that they don't do more damage. Also need a bigger space if they are doing a buffet. It was WAY too hard to move around. Servers seemed to be frustrated as well. I guess it keeps the food cost down when you cant get out to get to it!",

The strip mall where the restaurant is located just opened a healthy food market which has caused a parking disaster!  It doesn't help that there is a CVS and tons of other great dinning options within feet of Bistro La Bon.  Once parking happened, we went inside.  The dimly lit atmosphere provided the perfect mood for enjoying a cozy afternoon.  However, I found myself using the flashlight feature on my iPhone to read the menu.  The gentlemen at the table across from us did the exact same thing!    The small plates arrived and were made to perfection.  They are perfect for the not-so-hungry people.  The mushroom gnocchi is PHENOMENAL!  To wash it down, we enjoyed a mixed drink that tasted like a pineapple upside down cake (NOM NOM).    For the main course, I enjoyed the scallops.  Not only were they free of grit and fishy flavor, they were not over cooked!  The flavors were like an explosion in my mouth.  Wow!  I WILL be having those again. For dessert, I enjoyed the bread pudding.  There are no words to express my love for this sweet dessert. You must try it.    The waitress was very attentive and made sure our glasses were never empty.  I appreciate that!    Bon appetite.",

My friend had a flatbread which was described as a sandwich. If you order the pita with tomato and mozz - you're getting a flatbread and it'll have avocado. I picked the rosemary chicken and I wish I'd known it would be thigh. The flavors were good, I really liked the roasted veg and the mushroom gravy. I subbed fries for mashed potatoes. I didn't eat much of the chicken because I'm not a dark meat fan. Each of our plates were $10. I'd come here again because the food was good!",

The place was already loud but they added a low budge lounge singer to make it impossible to hear anyone at our table.   First we ordered and returned the fried avocado. What we ordered and what came to our table were completely different. We have had fried avocado many times that many restaurants and what came to our table look like an egg roll with mostly asparagus and some red peppers, returned.   The meal was pretty decent, but the desserts were a mess. One never came, and the espresso creme brulee was returned because the inside was totally watery looking like it was very old pudding.",

All were very good but I enjoyed the mussels & fries the most like who ever thought? Mussels and fries .. and cheese on top woah! The decor also caught my eye, I LOVE THE ANTIQUE CHAIRS, very nice vibes! Honestly I couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars but I'm leaning towards so 5 so why the heck not! My only complaint would be the frito misto, it was okay it just tasted like calamari in tomato sauce. Service AWESOME, Food GREAT(they have small plates hollaaa), Decor LOVE..Im really looking forward to come back & try out their brunch! (;",

    "text": "So after reading many stellar reviews about the Bistro La Bon brunch, my husband and I decided to check it out this past Sunday. Unfortunately, we didn't seem to get the hype on this occasion.   Bistro La Bon is located in a shopping center in Plaza Midwood. It's the corner spot and easily visible from the street. Ample parking since the place is in a strip small. Fairly small inside but I loved that they had couches in order to make the wake a bit comfier. The decor inside was very cute!! I also liked the outdoor seating that they had.   We arrived around noon on Sunday and were quoted a 45 minute wait. Grabbed a mimosa and took a seat on one of the comfy couches! $3 Mimosas for the win! After about an hour and fifteen, we were finally seated. Totally don't mind waiting at restaurants....though, patience is definitely one of my personal weaknesses. However, I totally appreciate when places over estimate the wait, so then I get excited when it is under time. Going 30 minutes over the quoted time when I was hunger games level of hungry was not the best start.   Anyways, our waiter came and explained that the buffet contains many items and that we could also order more. We ordered the eggs, bacon, french toast, and the chocolate waffle and then hit the buffet. The buffet contained a large assortment of items from fruit to pastries to potatoes to brisket. I would probably have to say that my favorite item was the biscuits and gravy or the briskett. My least favorite was the jalapeno mac n cheese (I love love mac n cheese and the strong jalapeno flavor was just not my cup of tea!). As for the food that came to the table, the french toast was the winner. As in, we definitely ordered a second order of the french toast! The bacon was overly greasy and not that great. The chocolate waffles were pretty good though to make up for the bacon.   While everything we ate was tasty, I just don't think I can justify the $22 buffet charge (fairly steep in comparison to other Charlotte brunch spots) when nothing that we ate was absolutely amazing. Service was not great (I believe we saw our waiter like 3 times, if that), a long wait for a table, and good (not great) food, made me land at a solid 3 stars for this experience. With all this being said, I do want to check out Bistro La Bon for dinner!",

I wanted to take pictures and stick them on my Pinterest board! Mimosas- Great!! Only $3...I can't believe I only had two.  The bad:  I am going to keep this short and to the point.  The restaurant itself has great potential, but paying $22 for poorly selected buffet food was irritating.  My eggs Benedict (that you order from the server) was Luke warm and dry, the buffet had lunch food and was less appealing, and the service was slow.  I hate buffets.  We were there celebrating a birthday so I tried to keep my complaints to myself.  We paid $80 for brunch that wasn't worth it.  I can't believe anyone wanting to drop that kind of money for that.  Probably won't be back.  :-(",

This was at 11:45 so if you plan on coming with a group, plan ahead and make reservations!  The waiter informed us that there were no menus for the day. It's one price ($20) for the buffet and includes any small plates that you would like to order to have come out. Small plates include eggs & bacon, chocolate waffles, and others.   We ordered the chocolate waffles and eggs & bacon to come out to accompany our buffet picks. The portion of eggs was more than enough for me and my friend. The chocolate waffle was half the size of a 'typical' belgian waffle and yummy but I would have loved for it to have been just a tad warmer.  The buffet was filled with things such as swedish meatballs (thumbs up emoji), potato salad, cranberry relish, fruit, cookies, mini muffins, scones, and much more. Everything I sampled was delicious.   Bistro La Bon is a great place for a group because there is something for everyone. Plus $3 mimosas don't hurt :)",

    "text": "Bistro la Bon is nothing short of amazing.  We finally tried them during Charlotte Restaurant Week, and my first thought upon leaving was, \"What took us so long to try this place?!\"    We had their kale and beet salads to start.  Both were very good.  Next, each of us had the octopus.  That dish was absolutely outstanding.  It was both spicy and slightly sweet--served with ratatouille and a creamy sauce (sour cream based?)--and was unbelievably tender.  I'd return to BLB just for THAT dish.    For our entrees, I had the scallops, and my husband had the filet, each a $6 upcharge.  Mine had four scallops, served with tiny croutons, hazelnuts, sliced fingerling potatoes, and a delicious sauce that tasted mushroom-based.  They were cooked perfectly, and just fantastic.  My husband's filet was also cooked to perfection, served with mashed potatoes and a little gravy.    For dessert I had the brioche bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, and my husband had the maple ice cream.  This was the finest bread pudding I've ever had - so light and delicious, sitting on top of caramel sauce.  As big as the serving was, I cleaned my plate (sharing just a few bites with my hubby).   Definitely try their cocktails.  My husband had the Mule, made with their homemade ginger syrup, and I had the Hemingway.  Both were amazing.  Our server, Crystal, was friendly and helpful.  As busy as they were, our dishes were delivered with perfect efficiency.  They were well-prepared for the crowd, and handled it flawlessly.  I haven't been this excited about a meal in a long time.  This is a MUST visit for locals and travelers alike.  We can't wait to return!",

Super cute decor with a nice bar and an open kitchen you can see right in when they're preparing your food.  Our server, Juan, was adorable, funny and attentive. I  ordered the jalapeno basil martini and my date had the sazarec (bullet cocktail) and they were both amazing, very well made (ok, I admit we had more than 1!) And the food was even better!  We split 3 small plates and an entree and rolled out of there- great portion size. The spicy shrimp and chorizo was in an amazing sauce. The grilled octopus was cooked to perfection, probably the best I've ever had. The gnocchi and mushrooms was an amazing consistency combination in a cream sauce and was so delicious (and I'm usually not a fan of gnocchi) and the duck 3 ways with risotto was fantastic, crispy, moist, flavorful, fantastic!  Their menu also labels gluten free and they have vegan options!",

The portions are very modest, and the prices are premium, but the presentation and flavor are excellent. The wine selection is superb.  The Swedish meatballs were very good. The sauce was perfect, and the mashed potatoes were seasoned to match, creating a very inviting dish.   The salmon too was well prepared and season and the gnocchi was very flavorful. It made a nice pairing.  The decor and atmosphere is modest, a little upscale, but inviting and made to be very comfortable for small groups of people.  This would be the perfect place for a double date or small gathering of friends that want something better than casual fare, and don't mind spending a little extra to get it.",

    "text": "I've been to Bistro La Bon in years past and have always enjoyed their brunch.  Went there for brunch this past weekend. The best thing on the brunch buffet was the shortbread cookies. The grits had an okay flavor but was lumpy, the brisket was nothing special and needed some seasoning, coconut macaroons tasted burnt on the outside as oppose to toasted. There where no eggs on the buffet. We ordered chocolate waffles that came out cold and gooey. Sent those back and the waitress suggested the French toast, okay. That too was cold and tasted like it was dipped in a simple egg batter. Needless to say, this was not an enjoyable experience. Now when we first arrived, it took a while to get service. We were asked if we wanted water but I guess that was just the water girl cause no one came over until we asked for assistance and our waitress was sent over. The place was less than a third full. I don't remember her name but when she did come over she was very accommodating. My sister asked for a hot toddy and they made it for her. She didn't drink her orange juice and wanted a togo cup but they were out (which I totally understand as it was Sunday afternoon and being in the industry myself, it not unusual). Since my sister didn't drink it our waitress did remove it from our tab. I feel like the food had potential...but that's all it had cause it didn't have flavor.",

I've always been a fan of the brunch, best in the neighborhood since we lost Lulu's, but I wasn't sold on dinner here until this past weekend. The food here has always been excellent (please bring back the steak tartare!) but I couldn't understand the hype about the mussels. The sauce was great but I thought the mussels were pretty meh. But my mind has changed. I decided to give them another go and I'm glad that I did because they were delicious. As was the fried avocado, goat cheese stuffed peppadew peppers, kale salad ( a star!) and the brie brulee( always a favorite). The mussels are more than enough for one person.   Im sure everyone had as least heard of the brunch here if they haven't been before. The items on the buffets are well sustained and things that are usually a bad idea on a buffet,i.e bacon, french toast, eggs, are all made to order. Keep in mind this is brUNCH, NOT breakfast, so don't be surprised like one reviewer to find (gasp!) lunch items on there. The brisket is awesome and so are the swedish meatballs (don't forget the lingonberry jam and cucumbers), and of course the in house made mozzarella.   As for the service aspect, there is a waiter guy here that is a bit off, but everyone else is great. Need a drink? Try the cucumber gimlet. Delish. Unlike a lot of the other restaurants in the neighborhood this is actually a great place to go with friends that you actually would like to talk to and HEAR what they are saying on a weekend.",

    "text": "Loved my experience here for Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week (Jan 2017). Bistro La Bon had one of the best restaurant week menus out there, which included 4 courses for $35 per person.   For my first course, I started with the Kale Salad while my boyfriend had the Roasted Beet and Apple salad. I like kale, but I did think the kale salad was a little bitter and the flavors didn't integrate as well as I'd hoped. But not bad enough to knock stars off this review.  For the second course, I ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus with roasted ratatouille, citrus aioli. YUM! If you like octopus (it's a little chewy). My boyfriend had the Crispy Avocado & Asparagus roll with sweet chili tamarind balsamic and he really appreciated the freshness in the texture and taste.  For the third course, we both ordered the Lavender Chicken over banana bread, walnuts, grapes, curry sauce. WOW! What awesome flavor combinations! The chicken was so well cooked and everything was just so satisfying.  For dessert, we also both ordered Bourbon Brioche Bread Pudding with house-made caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. HECK NO, I wasn't gonna share! A-Mazing.  We also each enjoyed a glass of red wine that the waiter recommended.  Also to note, it was easy to make a reservation (through Yelp) and we were seated upon arrival. Despite being restaurant week, Bistro La Bon wasn't crowded or noisy.",

    "text": "Wow! This place is one of a kind. The Sunday brunch here is truly decadent. I've never seen a brunch operate in this way - a traditional buffet table set up but with additional freshly made dishes brought to you from the kitchen straight to your table.   From the buffet table I had the Mac and cheese, the grits, the Swedish meatballs, and the biscuits and gravy. Each of these foods was excellent, but I'd say the grits were my favorite with the Mac and cheese at a close second. I'm a sucker for a good cheese grit and these really delivered.   From the kitchen, there was French toast, regular eggs and bacon, eggs Benedict, and chocolate waffles offered. My favorite from those would definitely be the French toast - super sweet and moist. I wasn't so much a fan of the eggs Benedict though as it seemed a little bland and the eggs were a bit overdone and not runny at all. The eggs and bacon were just what you'd expect - nothing bad but nothing mind blowing. But the yummy things truly outweighed the meh things in this scenario.   Some additional items that I did not try were some cauliflower and salmon. My brunch-mates thought they were both good though!    The place was very busy for the Sunday though, so keep that in mind if you're looking to go to brunch. Also, make sure your entire party is there because they will not seat you partially. Also, the waiters were incredibly attentive and helpful with bringing food.   Final verdict - You should 100% check out this restaurant for a great brunch experience! It is a truly decadent experience and leaves you stuffed and satisfied.",

Wife says her duck was outstanding while the other son fell in love with the saffron rice. The deco is real nice and live music is always a plus. The guy playing the guitar (Vadin?) is outstandingly good, great selection and a master playing it. Overall, VERY HIGHLY recommended place!",

The salmon was cooked perfectly and the potatoe ratio was good for someone like me who doesn't want to load up on carbs but can't help themselves when they are around (oops).   If you're hungry I would definitely keep in mind that the portions are small, even the entrees.  Next time I come back I'll probobly get a small plate as well as an entree.",

We began by sharing a small plate, the crispy avocado asparagus spring rolls. They were surprisingly good, crunchy, and not oily. For dinner I had their equivalent of paella and my husband had one of the salmon dishes. For dessert we shared the upside down apple cake served with pumpkin gelato. I look forward to trying Brunch sometime soon.",

They also do a great job with their cocktails and the wine list is very satisfying too.",

We waited less than ten minutes for a table to open up, and were seated in the middle of the restaurant.   Our server came over to greet us and explained how brunch works there; there's a plentiful buffet near the front of the restaurant, and there are a handful of dishes made-to-order that you can request at no additional cost. We each ordered an additional breakfast item with a side of bacon, and the kitchen put all of our orders of bacon on one plate. What a sight to see a heap of bacon delivered to your table!  The made-to-order dishes were fine; they seemed as though they'd been sitting for awhile before they were brought to the table, as the  the hollandaise sauce was cold.   The buffet, though, was quite nice. There was a nice assortment of fruit, salads, proteins, and desserts. I loved the sausage and cabbage being served by the kitchen window and ended up going back for seconds and thirds. The coconut macaroons on the dessert table were perfect. I enjoyed more than my fair share of those.  I would definitely return for brunch, and I'd like to make my way here for dinner, too. Our group had a very pleasant experience and left satisfied.",

It was a good dining experience.  I later learned that the bouillabaisse is on the regular menu at the Cotswold location.  I noticed on the  menu it has a higher level of seafood in the dish!

My mister was definitely amused by the random trinkets in the bookcase that separates the sofa lounge areas from the main dining space.  We went for Saturday brunch, which seems to be less stellar than the buffet on Sundays. The menu for Saturday brunch was somewhat limited for options. I had the salmon Benedict. I can't resist ordering a Benedict when it is a choice, but I was a bit underwhelmed by this one. The English muffin was super chewy and hard. It frankly may have been stale. The bearnaise was super salty. I think I would have preferred hollandaise instead. Did I finish it? Absolutely due to the price, but I would not order it again. The star of my meal was the potato cake. So good! Think outside crispy hashbrowns with inner flavorful mashed potatoes. The coffee was also great. Our server was nice and quick with the refills, but she wasn't overly friendly by any means.   If I had to quantify my rating, 4 stars for decor and service, 5 for the potato cake and coffee, and 3 for the salmon Benedict.",

    "text": "You know that time you went to a restaurant and said to yourself \"wow, this place is so good!  I have to come back.\"?  That's me and Bistro La Bon.  I've only ever been here for dinner.  Each time, the food has been fantastic and the service a bit slow.  My recommendation:  Perfect place for a date, double date, group catch-up or guests out of town that you're looking to impress.  You want an amazing meal without the wait staff coming around too often.  Last night, I went for restaurant week.  It didn't disappoint.  The beet/apple salad with a few dabs of white sauce was inventive.  Gnocchi and brussel sprout dishes for the second course were fantastic.  Both sauces were absolutely delicious and flavorful.  The Sweedish Meatballs and Lavender Chicken for the main courses were both awesome.  I'm a huge Sweedish Meatball fan...these were larger than Ikea size with more flavor.  Lavender Chicken was really flavorful and light.  I highly recommend this dish if you're having a heavier meal.  Best part was the chocolate dessert and the bread pudding.  Both absolutely fantastic...like so good that we didn't have room left in our stomachs after the main course, but managed to lick the dessert plates clean.  Drinks were pretty good, and I recommend ordering off the cocktail menu.  I'm a huge Cucumber fan so I recommend the Cucumber Gimlet.  Recommendation...if you don't want to do a huge meal, this is a PERFECT place to meet for drinks/apps.  They have a really cool bar area and front patio where you can sit and have a drink with a friend or date.",

I figured it would be in an upscale environment, but it was on the end of a strip mall that featured a Family Dollar. Inside was a nice bar area, and the dining area was an \"industrial\" looking dining room with exposed brick and ductwork. Service was good (our waiter was friendly but it seemed a bit forced) and it was prompt. Now the food was pretty good. The Jalapeno Mac & Cheese was pretty good. It had a nice creamy texture and had just enough spice to open the flavor up but not overpower it. Also the Salmon Benedict was very flavorful, and the eggs were poached perfectly! (always a plus).  Another plus is the Bloody Mary, You order your drink and they bring you a glass of vodka of your choosing in a little ice and then you get to go to the bar and choose your own mixers, spices, veggies, etc. I must admit I make a pretty dang good Bloody Mary!",

The interior is beautiful with a gorgeous sweeping bar and bar area in front.  We try to get the couches in the front to eat our dinner.  If you are feeling more formal though go ahead and sit in the back with the nicer tables and chairs.  The food here is DIVINE!!  The pepperdew app is my fav - so simple and delicious.

Upon entering the unassuming storefront, you are transported into a charming interior befit for  celebrations.  I came here on a lazy Sunday for an anniversary brunch. I was a little skeptical at first as I usually associate buffets with eating sub-par food from troughs, hangovers in Las Vegas, and those trays of nasty scrambled eggs that are somehow runny despite being overcooked.  This brunch is no buffet but rather a self-described smorgasbord that will far exceed your expectations.  Note: NO mimosas before noon on Sunday (Thank you Chapter XIV of the1741  North Carolina General Assembly). But when they do come, they come cheap and strong (only $3!) ;)  Service: our server was on-point. Very attentive and gracious with refilling the coffee (I hate few things more than ordered the bottomless coffee that never gets refilled).   Bacon: Bewarned, one order of bacon contained about 6 stripes of perfectly fried crunchy bacon. I warn you because you will eat all of them despite your hardest efforts. Take it easy there!  French Toast: thick, fluffy, and sweet. Just the way I like it.  Chocolate Waffles: nice as a novelty, but considering all of the other delectable options I'll save my room for the smorgasbord next time.   The smorgasbord itself is an array of awesome. Swedish meatballs that would make IKEA blush, rich potato gratin, juicy beef brisket, the list goes on. There is nothing on there that I didn't get twice. The only thing that we wanted for was cream cheese for the salmon and bread.  Be seeing you soon!",

This being said, I had the WORST experience I have ever had with a waitress on Saturday night.   When I asked her preference between 2 drinks on the menu she replied with an extreme answer about never drinking something like that because she's \"a whisky girl.\"  Following my drink order she barked at me another rude remark about \"That's why you should NEVER ask your waitress what they prefer.\"   For the rest of the meal she was rude, never smiled and was over all very unpleasant.  I do not think the restaurants good food or reputation should be tarnished because of one pompous and nasty employee. I enjoyed my food but the experience of being treated that way by my waitress set a negative mood for the remainder of the meal.  This being said,  I overheard the women at the table next to me talking about how unpleasant she was to them as well.   Overall, despite the good food I am left with a bad taste in my mouth.

The set up is really strange.  They have a brunch buffet on the weekends, and 90% of the food is out and self service, but the good stuff they bring to your table.  French toast, waffles, eggs, bacon are all brought to the table and served family style....however the portions are ridiculously small.  For a table of six we got three corners (1/4 of a full waffle!).  What the heck?   Ditto with the plate of bacon and eggs.  For a table of six we were given three slices of french toast.   This is not huge toast either, picture texas toast size slices.  And here's where the service part comes in.  Getting refills of anything be it food, or drinks is a nightmare.  NIGHTMARE!!  Bistro La Bon is attempting to be trendy, pretentious with the set up - or maybe they are just being cheap, but for $20 a pop I really don't want to have to hunt down my waiter for a 2nd slice of bacon.  It's a shame, the food is quite tasty.  In fact of all of the items, there were two that were not my cup of tea- the potato gratin was tasteless and the chocolate waffle.  The waffle was just too chocolate-y for me.",

Her birthday did fall during restaurant week, so I understand it's a busy time, but we made the reservation early & it was a Monday night. Dinner took 4 hours. At one point we watched as our 2nd course sat in the window for a good 15 minutes with our server nowhere in sight. Third course was only delivered to half our party & server didn't return until much later to be made aware. We were going to a concert afterward. By the time we got there, it was over. And then those of us who had eaten the Brie began to purge it rapidly & had to rush home. Never again.",

The Service was 5 yelp stars off the charts, great teamwork and very friendly, eager to talk about the food and ask the Chef if they did not know!   To me it seems like a fusion of flavors from a range of cultures (I think someone said the owner was born in Syria and raised in Sweden).  The Soup was Summer Squash, Zucchini, Olive Oil, Tomato (cold like Gazpacho and many of the same ingredients - so it will be on my Gazpacho list).  This \"soup\" was very mild and delicious at least 4 yelp stars!  The Salad was simple and very good - the dressing was Excellent (Citrus Champagne Vinaigrette??).  My Entree was Gnocchi with Prime Rib, okra, corn, tomatoes (yellow and red).  The Bread was good one was like Cake the other was like... mmm Bread.  Dessert - I questioned my waiter about Espresso - He said he was not sure they could make it that rich and sweet - Good Call, NO GREAT CALL - This is where I appreciate Fantastic service!!!!!  So I had the Awesome Flourless Chocolate Cake, garnished with Blackberries, Blueberries and Strawberries, with Mango Sorbet instead of Chocolate Ice cream!!!  The Two dinners the most recent November 11th 2011were fantastic! !  !  The Best Duck breast I have ever tasted and cooked Rare as requested, Swedish Meatballs with Lindon berry Sauce on top of Mashed potatoes, a Seafood dish and Fillet Mignon!  Bread Pudding for Dessert all Five yelp star ratings!  I brought my Girlfriend here for her Birthday after we were Married!  This IS a GREAT Celebration Destination!  POPROCK LOVE and I had Dinner here one Thursday Night just so I could break my Never on Thursday Rule!",

I would get it again a crumble a little bacon in it :) One of my friends got the turkey sandwich which was an open faced sandwich with a salad..apparently it was delicious as she ate every bite. The atmosphere is nice inside. Outside, there is seating and heaters, but it's next to the road and a Five Guys, so I don't know if I'd want to eat out there. Overall, I'd return for Saturday brunch!",

I was hoping for some grits, but there  were only cheese grits. I suppose the fact that they cook eggs to order along with waffles and french toast as part of the buffet is pretty good. But the eggs and french toast I got were not great, just OK. Sorry I cant tell ya I loved it (or hated it) but that's the truth - its just OK.",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to check our Bistro La Bon for Sunday Brunch today.  I had heard from several friends that it was great but had I gone into the restaurant completely ignorant of things I think I would have been a little confused.    Sunday Brunch is a buffet of a lot of items that I wouldn't really consider breakfast or brunch type food - meatballs, roast beef, roasted veggies, kielbasa, potatoes au gratin. All of these were pretty delicious but I was kind of sad not to see more breakfast oriented items.  That being said, there were several pastries and some grits available in the buffet.  I think the wait staff assumes you know whats going on when you come in but they do explain that eggs, bacon, French toast, and waffles can be delivered to the table.  I believe these servings were meant for more than one person but 3 scrambled eggs and 4 strips of bacon isn't exactly a sharing amount.  Nor is one quarter of a waffle or one slice of French toast.  Of course you can always order more.  I think the price probably ought to be explained up-front, its 20 dollars.  Maybe they could hand out a little information for you while you wait.  I'm not sure, I just wasn't exactly blown away by everything and I thought the buffet items were pretty weird.  I'd be interested to try Saturday Brunch as I understand its more breakfast food oriented.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited for Charlotte Restaurant week.  We frequented other restaurants in the area but never went here for whatever reason.  I'll break things down as best I can.  Food:  I opted for the farm lettuce salad (1st course), the trio tapenade  (2nd course), the saffron risotto (3rd course), and the flourless chocolate cake (4th course).  The salad was okay--I don't like balsamic vinegar, but Bistro can't be faulted for that.  If you like it, you'll probably like the salad.  The trio tapenade was tasty--it came with cannellini beans for one dipping option, guacamole, and roasted eggplant.  It was quite good--the pita crisps were a welcome change as opposed to the normal pita bread you usually get.  The saffron risotto was bright, colorful and had some robust flavors.  I wasn't expecting it to be that good because it didn't smell that great (you eat with your nose, too ya know), but after three careful  forkfuls, I decided that I had picked the right choice.  I'll definitely have it again.  For dessert, the flourless cake was really good.  That was my first flourless cake ever.  It was accompanied by a mango sorbet, which didn't make much since on the plate.  It came dusted with some type of brown sugar sprinkle, which also made no sense texturally when paired with the sweet and smooth sorbet.  All in all, I'd visit this place again and see what other vegetarian options they have.  Location:  You really can't go wrong with Plaza Midwood.  It's turned into a cultural hot spot and has shed its past reputation for being a seedy and somewhat dangerous place.  It's a great place to visit now and live if you're interested.  The one thing I don't like about Bistro is its attachment to a dilapidated plaza.  Although it occupies the corner, its doing itself a disservice by being located there.  Service:  Umm....it wasn't the best. Our server brought out the courses in the wrong order and seemed new.  She didn't really exude the confidence you expect in a good server.  She was pleasant, she smiled when greeting us, but all in all it could have been better.  Summation:  Go check this place out.  If you're into some decent food a fairly decent price, I think you'll like this place.",

But I finally got around to trying out brunch at Bistro La Bon after hearing rave reviews from a bunch of friends.   Although located in a sketchy strip mall on Central Avenue, once inside the restaurant, you would never guess where it was located. Very nice decor, lots of seating, friendly hostess and good service. For $18, you get a nice little spread.   Some of my favorite items: - French toast: light and airy, this is some of the best french toast I've ever had. I ate it all so we had to order more from our server for my dining companions! - Chocolate cream cheese muffins: enough said - how could that be bad? - Kielbasa and cabbage: I don't even like either of these items normally, but gave it a go; it was a very good combo and I proceeded to have seconds. - Greek salad: I'm a sucker for a good Greek salad, and this didn't disappoint. - Coconut macaroons: best I've ever tried; they were gooey and delicious and completely addictive.  The buffet also had many other items, and the server will bring you scrambled eggs, chocolate waffles, and bacon if you'd like. This is no Vegas buffet, but the selection they do have is very good and well thought out.   My only issue was that we got there at 11:15am on a Sunday so weren't able to order the $3 mimosas or $4 bloody marys. All in all it was very good and we'll be back soon!",

    "text": "Had dinner reservations for 4 people on a Friday night at 7:45. Food was good. Better than 3 stars, but it was SO loud we could barely talk amongst ourselves at the table. Also our table was teetering half on a carpet so we had to move it. I feel like that should have been resolved without us doing so. Maybe it's quieter at different times but I couldn't believe the noise level.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch with my girlfriend this past Sunday. Neither one of us had ever been there before and we both enjoy the decor and thought the restraunt was odd and cute. Unknowingly, they only truly offer a brunch buffet with a few items out from the kitchen. Our server brought us these cute little \"tasting plates\" of the kitchen items and I thought that was pretty cool. We were both hungry and ate with our eyes so we piled our first plates up and sadly got full after that. The Bloody Mary was good, nice and spicy like I like it. A tad bit on the little size but it's $4 so you can't really complain. I'll have to come back the next time I'm hungover and get the True experience of brunch buffet.",

    "text": "Food was good, but service wasn't great. I ate here for Queen's Feast, and it was almost like they forgot that my friend and I were at a table in the corner. It took almost 3 hours for them to complete the courses, and one of the waiters was extremely rude to the patrons at the table sitting next to us. I would advise you to make sure you have several hours to spend at dinner before eating here. I wish that I had a better experience because the food is really good. I would recommend the brie brule for sure.",

    "text": "I have been here for brunch and dinner.  This place is super close to a lot of other restaurants I've been to in the area and is tucked in neatly in the shopping center behind the CVS and is located right next to a brand new Ramen Shop, Yama Izakaya.  Bistro by far is my most visited dining establishment.  I love the friendliness of the staff as they're very attentive.  I forget his name but a waiter I've usually had is a dude with an awesome mustache.  Props man.  I had gone there for dinner and ordered a prime rib.  I seriously wish I could pan fry a prime rib like their chef did.  The bites I took seriously just burst with flavor.  It is a great place to take a date and can be optionally dressy or casual.  However you want.  I usually go there casual dressy.   If you haven't been here you should seriously reconsider your priorities.",
