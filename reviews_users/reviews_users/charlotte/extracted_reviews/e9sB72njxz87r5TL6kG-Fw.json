The sides are awesome. From mac and cheese (delicious) to a pan fried corn (a nice surprise), which was fantastic. I went on a Friday night and it was busy with a really nice energetic vibe happening. But we didn't have a wait, and were seated immediately. And the food arrived timely. The service was great (Jaklyn was our server, great job). Great appetizer choices. We had the Sinatra. It was delicious. Don't be scared of this place if you have a vegetarian with you, the black bean and quinoa burger was amazing. Seriously, check this place out. You won't leave hungry or disappointed.",

The musician pictures on the walls, the waitresses seem cool, the menu looked pretty promising as well with a wide variety of signature burgers...but when I got the food, it just feels flat, just expected more out of the food. The burgers are just alright and not as savory as I expected. The mac and cheese side was a bit too oily and greasy. I also had the disco fries was a Montreal style poutine; now I'm from Montreal and I didn't expect it to be authentic poutine but I expected it to be decent. It wasn't as the gravy wasn't warm and the cheese curds were lacking. As a whole, its a decent place to eat but could be a lot better.",

We started with the chili which was a large bowl of tastiness with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips, and a large hunk of cornbread for the dipping.  The Alamo tex mex salad is quite good too with corn, black beans, tomatoes and avocado.  We went for a couple of dressings on the side and enjoyed the poppy seed as recommended by others.  The Lisa Marie chicken sandwich was very tasty with a choice of side (sweet tots awesome).  They have an interesting cocktail menu, and several wines, draft beers and a cider to choose from.  The waitress we had was fantastic, super efficient and quick on the refills of water and soda waters.... thanks much.  I will be back to try the house specialty burgers some time... can't wait.",

    "text": "I must say I was very impressed with Cowbell! The former Nix location has been replaced by another burger joint that is a sister restaurant of Leroy Fox and Mortimer's. The interior is dark but intriguing and inviting. The feel is much more upscale than you would think of a burger place but in such a good way! I sat at the bar, which is a very good size by the way, but there didn't seem to be too many tables from what I remember. (FYI, this place looks nothing like the old Nix restaurant. It's been completely revamped.)   I didn't even intend to eat when I went in for the first time last night but after salivating over the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the Sweet Potato Corndog. Oh yeah... it was as good as it sounds! The batter was rich and sweet and the hotdog was big and greasy. The fries were up there with the best of them too. I also sampled a friend's sweet potato tater tots and they were excellent as well. My service was on point and I never had to wait for anything. The food maybe only took 10 minutes, which is always a plus. I believe my corndog with fries was only $6 or $7,  which was surprising for an Uptown spot. I only drank one beer while there but I did browse what seemed to be an extensive whiskey menu.   I really dug the atmosphere as it was hip but not too stuffy or pretentious. There were also some pretty rad old school rock music videos being played all night. But what will keep me coming back is the food. I can't wait to go back to try some of the burgers as there were so many options that sounded downright delicious. Only downside? This place might just be a little too close to my home. Willpower is key here... ;)",

    "text": "Some things are better in theory than in practice, and so it was with the burger I had at Cowbell.   But first, the good:  great atmosphere. Much better than its predecessor burger joint, Nix. Clean, inviting, great for watching sports.   The service was also great, if not overeager. I had no less than three people waiting on lil ole me, and it got kind of confusing. When they dropped the check off, I was taking my time (it wasn't busy, so I wasn't tying up a table or anything) and one of my army of servers came over to take it up before I even had a chance to put my credit card down.   The bad:  the side I had. The cucumber salad. Since cucumber salad is the new, hip-happenin side du jour, I'd like to ask all the burger joints to have a sit down and decide how it should be made.   This one was not good. The cucumbers had some weird sweet taste to them. And the vast majority of the cucumber salad was not, in fact, cucumber - it was raw onion. Ack. Go for some other side.  The ugly:  the burger. I'm sorry to have to say that. I wanted to like it -- I really did.  I had The Bruiser, a blackened patty with mushrooms, horseradish sauce, onions, lettuce and blue cheese. Sounds yum, right?  But noooooo. First there was so much blue cheese on it, it killed the rest of the flavors. But just to make sure I had no possible chance of tasting the meat, they doused the burger with about a gallon of horseradish sauce. It came gushing out the sides and it was clear from the get-go that I was going to need to eat this puppy with a fork (or a hazmat suit).  The onion kaiser bun was DOA from all that goo.   There's also the issue of \"blackening.\" Normally this means a little spiciness. Perhaps it was the killer cloaking combo of blue cheese and horseradish, but I'm thinking that the blackening spice used here was... salt. Blech.  Finally, I ordered the burger medium. It came out overdone. And I'm not convinced the meat quality was all that good either based on what I could see after I used a trowel to scrape all the crap off the burger.   It makes me sad that a cow gave her all for that travesty of a burger. Seriously - a huge disappointment.   I'd go back if my dinner companion insisted, but I'd definitely go for a much, much simpler burger or something else altogether. But what's the point of going to a burger joint if the burgers aren't up to snuff?",

The manager Mike brought the fries out after 10 minutes at minimal. We politely told him we no longer wanted them. He immediately became defensive and advised us that he was short staffed and again asked if we wanted them or not with the least bit of empathy or ownership taken? Totally unacceptable from a store manager. I tried to speak with him after our meal, unfortunately Mike brushed us off.",

    "text": "So have been in Charlotte (pretty much weekly) for about 10 months or so and Cowbell has turned into one of my consistent \"go to\" spots. It is a burger joint serving up an extensive variety of burgers and they also serve small bites, wings, and salads. This joint also serves up a good selection of whiskeys and they have what seems like an endless supply of drinks. I have been to this place over a dozen times now and it is a consistent experience that I can totally appreciate.  The restaurant itself is not large with a \"L\" Shaped bar and around 20- 25 tables. They also have live music on certain nights if that's your type of thing. The bartenders & waitresses area always friendly and accommodating and there are plenty of TVs set up for you to watch whatever sports you are into as you enjoy your meal. I have gotten plenty of different types of burgers including the umami, dumpling, Carolina but for me the one that stands out is the PM burger. I always get my burgers naked so unfortunately I wont have a ton of perspective on the bread but the meat is cooked well and the toppings are always plentiful. For the PM burger I love the jalepenos that come out with it and ALWAYS get the sweet potato tater tots .They are just delish (never soggy) and perfect in some honey mustard for me but I figure they will go well with anything. Finishing a meal here with two mcallans double neat is my perfect night meal.  All in all, you know exactly what you are getting here and the food is consistent with good vibes. Nothing more than I can ask for that knowing that I will always enjoy my meal. Will miss grabbing some burgers from this place when I stop hitting up NC.",

So definitely try that out if it's your thing.  The first time a friend and I tried to go, we were told we could have a seat within a few minutes, but it would be a 3 hour wait for food. We wound up leaving, but I have no idea what would have caused that kind of delay.  A couple days later we were able to get in. Lots of unique options for burgers, in addition to your standard fare. Was a little disappointed that when our food arrived, our appetizer, salads, and main course all arrived within two minutes of each other so by the time I actually got to the main course it wasn't warm anymore. I ordered onion rings as my side and was a little bummed that there were only three average-sized rings. Not exactly what I expected for something that required an upcharge.  The restaurant itself was pretty loud and the music is generally rock music - a nice mix of new music and some favorites from the 90s - so I don't necessarily recommend it if you intend on having a nice conversation with a friend/coworker/significant other.  All in all a good experience. I may stop in next time I'm in town, but not necessarily at the top of the list.",

I could see how the people who work in the area would like coming here for lunch or for an after work drink.   Food was very good.  Husband was pleased with his drink. Small drawbacks were: 1) my order was mixed up, but the server made sure it was corrected quickly and I got my food only a few minutes after everyone else.  2) The ladies restroom is in an odd location.

We arrived around 1 PM and were seated right away.  My husband got the Patty Melt which was delicious and I got the Lisa Marie which was also very good. I have to say my favorite part of the meal was the mac n cheese side. I have never had mac n cheese that creamy and delicious before. Definitely something everyone needs to try. We also got a smores milkshake which was also very good. Our only complaint would be that we didn't expect the sweet potato tots to be sweet with cinnamon and sugar, but they were still good.  This was an awesome last minute find! Definitely a place to check out.",

    "text": "I dropped in to Cowbell on a Monday afternoon for lunch with a friend.  We were seated immediately - the restaurant about half full.   I loved the atmosphere - kind of artsy meets rock n roll meets a bit of glam.    The menu has a really large selection of burgers (of course), chicken sandwiches, tacos, wings and salads.  You get your choice of a great selection sides - including onion rings, sweet potato tots, mac n'cheese, fries, pan-fried corn and cucumber salad.    I ordered the Jimmy Page turkey burger - which was topped with candied bacon, granny smith apple, cheddar cheese and pineapple sriracha.  Turkey burgers require a bit of finesse - they have a tendency to dry out very quickly and be somewhat bland.  I was thrilled to receive a juicy and very flavorful burger.  The pineapple sriracha provided a mildy sweet, mildly spicy flavor that paired well with the apple and bacon.  For my side, I went with the onion rings.  Wow.  I received 3 giant onion rings - the outside was crispy and cooked perfectly while the inside was soft and soooooo tasty!    Overall, I had a great experience.  The table next to me had the Carolina burger and sweet potato tots -- that also looked amazing, I'm excited to go back again and further explore the menu.",

    "text": "The wife and I were in Charlotte for a concert and went on the hunt for a local, non-chain place to grab lunch before we made the trek back to RVA.  After a quick perusal of our trusty Yelp app, we agreed on Cowbell and were off.   While downtown, parking for Cowbell is a breeze as there is a parking deck just around the block.  We got there a little before noon and were seated right away.  The menu is, literally, all over the place (in a good way).  While they, obviously, have an incredibly diverse selection of burgers, they also have wings, tacos, salads and a respectable chicken sandwich section for those that may not be in the mood for a burger.   Based on the server's recommendation, we started with \"The Sinatra\" (fried mozzarella with sliced prosciutto, fresh basil, and tomato sauce).  While you wouldn't think that a little bit of salty ham could profoundly impact fried cheese, but it was a very welcome change of pace that certainly changed the flavor profile and was a solid compliment to the mozzarella!   For entrees, the wife went with the \"Dumpling Burger\" (Asian pork burger, hoisin glaze, slaw, and Sriracha aioli), but admitted that it was better in concept than execution.  She felt that the glaze was overly salty and overpowered what could have been a really tasty (and unique) pork burger.  The sweet potato tots that she got as her side; however, were out of this world!  A nice sugary sprinkle really took the crispy pockets of mashed sweet potato to new heights.   I opted for \"Big Will's Breakfast Burger\" (beef burger served on a croissant roll with an over-easy egg, praline smoked bacon, honey mustard, lettuce and onion) and was very, very pleased.  The burger was nice and juicy, and once the yolk of the egg broke, it took the flavor up a notch.  The praline bacon was awesome, smoky with a slight sweetness that wasn't lost amongst everything else that was going on in my mouth.  I selected the french fries, but again at the server's suggestion, went with them \"Dali Style\" with Sriracha aioli.  Awesome heat and a great step up in flavor profile for standard french fries.   All in all, a great burger joint that I can see being VERY popular for late night after the \"Whiskey Bar\" part of their namesake starts flowing.  Will definitely stay on our list of recommendations for folks in Charlotte!",

I ordered the turkey mini sliders, half expecting them to be overcooked or dry as they are in other restaurants - but \"Au contraire, mon frere\"! The meat was tender, juicy, and had a little bit of spicy heat to it for additional flavor. I'm a burger snob and this really hit the spot. The sweet potato tots side are like desert with their yummy cinnamon flavor. The service was great, even with the World Cup crowds. The owner was very warm, welcoming, funny, and actually explained why Jack Nicholson is on the wall of famous singers.   In summary: Great food and great atmosphere with the energy vibe you want to be around after a long day in the office. Check it out and your stomach will thank you.",

On both occasions, we were seated fairly promptly upon arrival. The waitresses who waited on us were friendly and helpful with bith food as well as drink questions. This restaurant has a fairly large selection of whiskey and several good burger and sandwich options.  I have tried the buffalo chicken sandwich as well as the California (full name escapes me) burger. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich was decent..not great but not bad either. The California burger, however, is REALLY good. I know it is a turkey burger and all you burger purists will gasp audibly when you read this, but it really IS that good!  I know this has become one of our regular spots when in Charlotte.. you should check it out too!",

I also had the banana pudding shake (without alcohol) and that was a piece of art in and of itself! So good and worth trying if you get a chance.

I decided on the Kirk burger and it was SO good. I was mind-blown that the patty was vegan friendly and packed so much flavor! I will definitely be coming back to try the other food items.

Although it was flagged as spicy in the menu, I didn't really think it was I ordered this with a side of Mac and cheese which had great flavor overall although I was hoping it would be baked but it was not. However, the panko crust + rosemary did add an interesting twist. A friend of mine ordered the tater tots which have a sweet cinnamon seasoning and I would recommend this side as well. Washed it down with \"The Croce\" because I'm a sucker for a classic old fashioned. Overall great food, good atmosphere; looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "A real mixed bag experience the other night. Some good some bad, nothing terrible but nothing remarkable.  We got to the Cowbell around 10PM on a Friday night. Fortunately we got a table right away and drinks came quickly. Roll in with a party of 4, two of us (myself included) have been before and 2 were newcomers who needed some time going over the extensive menu. We started with beer cheese pretzels which were great; dark, complex Guiness flavor meets a mellow, earthy cheese, I'm a fan. Expecting to followup with an even more impressive burger!  So some of you might not be a fan of the Foie Gras concept (if unfamiliar, do your research). Cowbell claims to responsibly source their Foie Gras, so don't start a protest for my menu selection, it CAN be done. I did indeed order the GFY Burger with Beef, Foie Gras, Greens, an apricot sauce, and creole mustard. After a bite or two I decided to deconstruct the burger because something was not harmonizing right. Beef patty was great, an accurate medium doneness and worked well with the apricot. What didn't work for me was the mustard. I'm not a big fan of mustard to begin with but for a place that touts a $20 burger, I was willing to take it as-is. The biggest problem was that the Foie Gras either on the burger or alone was a let down. I was really unimpressed with the flavor profile, and had a gamy undertone. $20 burger this was not.  While two of my buddies were very happy with their burgers, one of them ordered the Dumpling Burger and it came out drenched in hoisin sauce. I mean, you pick it up and it was dripping out of the bun. I think part of the blame is on him for getting the sriracha aioli on the side. You see, a mayo or aioli on a toasted bun serves as a barrier, the fat keeps other liquid from penetrating the bun temporarily. The aioli indeed was very spicy, but oh well, lesson learned.  We all got drinks and I think this is what Cowbell does best. One of my friends got a premium whisky and coke and I could definitely become a whisky guy after stealing a sip. I got the spiked s'mores milkshake. It was good but I think it could have been better. It was very boozy, it threw it a little off balance because the subtle notes of chocolate, and graham cracker was lost in the alcohol. I almost wonder if I got a double pour... Satisfying, but I was hoping for more unity in the flavors.  The night took a really weird turn when the bouncer left the door for a minute (I'm assuming for a bathroom break) and when no one took his place, a short, young girl walked in and immediately started running to tables. She got to ours and it was clear she didn't speak english. She threw a pamphlet in front of us to donate money to help kids... just kids, no explanation. I told her we weren't interested and she, no joke, sat down in a chair with a notebook and wanted me write my name and a dollar amount... It was very off-putting but she finally went to another table. Before I could inform our waitress, the bouncer returned, seemingly recognized her, and escorted her out. Perhaps if this is a problem they should have someone at the door at all times, it is Uptown after all.  A bit exhausted with the ups and downs of the experience, we forego'ed dessert and headed to NoDa. I'm not sure if I just got series of bad combinations or if I should just view the place as a good whisky bar, boy is that liquor menu impressive. One way or the other I'll drop in soon with a fresh perspective and hope it isn't the norm.",

The Burgers (Duhhh).  Not super-sized but jam-packed with great flavor and ingredients.  2. The Sides Mac & Cheese and Sweet Potato Tatter Tots FTW!! the Tots have a dash of cinnamon so you know they're magical.  3. The Ambiance The decor is dope. Hip and Modern. Art, Music, Sweet Decorations. There's an awesome painting in the men's bathroom called The Punch. Check it out and wash your hands while you're at it   4. Whiskey Because Whiskey + Burgers trump everything else  5. The Dumpling Burger Yes, it's that good that it warranted it's own number. Try it and tell me I'm wrong! I'll wait ...   Side note: If they have the Organic Chocolate Porter available, try that too. Deliciousness in a bottle.",

I will definitely stop here again when I'm back in town.",

I opted for the Boogan's Bacon, which ultimately fell apart and had to get eaten with a knife and fork. The tots were a major disappointment. Sweet potato tots, they were seemingly coated with some sort of sweet glaze. I realize some people like brown sugar with their sweet potatoes, but with a burger this was altogether unsatisfactory. The texture was poor and the taste clashed badly with the burger. Service was good though, and I'd try again in the future.",

This was my first visit and the waitress was able to spend time answering all of my questions about items on the menu.  There was really no wait to order or receive food which is a huge plus on a busy night.   The atmosphere is nice.  Very trendy decor throughout the restaurant.  The bar area is beautiful and chandelier lighting was a perfect touch.  My friends ordered an appetizer: fries with gravy, cheese, mushrooms, & onions.  I usually don't like this type of item, but tasted it anyway and it was delicious!  I was really impressed.  They have a huge selection of alcoholic beverages, almost overwhelming!  The Pineapple Express burger was so wonderful! The only thing I didn't like was the BBQ sauce.....stay away from it!! Awful! Onion rings, corn, and especially sweet potato puffs=sooooooooo yummy!!

This happened at least 8 times during my meal, quite inefficient.  The manager or shift leader was sitting at the bar for so long I thought he was a customer himself...   As for food we got the turkey burger. Do NOT get this. The patty tasted like mush, either it was raw or just mixed with too much flour or white bread even? Honestly tasted like soggy white bread... Sent it back for a beef patty well done. It came back medium well and was delicious. This place tends to cook things under. Fries were good and the Stanley nuts dessert was great (fried sweet potato cake donuts with ice cream and a sweet frosting). Lots of whiskey and beer selection.  I'd come back here for snacks like fries:tots, desserts and beer but definitely the place to sit at is the bar. Much better burgers and service in LA, maybe I'm spoiled :P",

I ate here once before, and didn't remember it being mind-blowing. Since it's a burger joint, it was only logic for me to order a burger. My other half was about to order wings - kid you not, I almost backhanded him on his head - why the heck would he want to come to a burger place out of the wing to have wings!!!??? Once he found his misplaced senses, he went with a burger as well (or for the pure fear of being smacked by me).   I opted for the Jerry Garcia with a side of onion rings. Only 3 onion rings but they were big and perfectly fried and when i took a bite the onion stayed put! The burger was perfectly seasoned (but a bit tiny) and cooked (medium per my request). It's an open face burger with a brown gravy and the entire thing was legit.  He ordered a plain burger as always (bless his heart), but it came with a big portion of fries (normally served with sprinkled cheese, he asked for that plain as well). Fries were tasty.  The 2 burgers were $20 and a soda put it a $25 dinner for 2.   Not sure if I will go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm in uptown and feeling a burger, this is definitely the place to go!",

Our experience was quite the opposite on this visit, however.  Not long after we set and ordered, a group of 4 clearly intoxicated guests sat down close to us and began ordering drinks/shots and an appetizer with the same waitress. After at least twenty minutes after taking our order (and watching that same table receiving and finishing the same appetizer we ordered), we finally received our own lil smokies. At least that's what I think they were (badly burnt and extremely poorly prepared). We've ordered these before and have never been this badly prepared and cooked.  The service continued to remain poor as the group of four (who continued to order shots) were visited several times while I couldn't even get a refill on water. There are many more places we could have gone to celebrate her birthday and receive much better service. We've recommend Cowbell to several coworkers due to fairly good food and service in the past, but don't think we can going forward. There are too many new places opening in Uptown to make mistakes like this with frequent customers.  Sent a similar complaint email to management but never heard back.",

The sushi was great as well, typical choices. They also had a fusion menu called \"burgooshi\" .. Burger Sushi style!

They have a burger for everyone and for whatever mood you're in. Meat is great quality and always cooked right. If you're not wanting a burger, you'll be fine with anything else on the menu. Haven't had anything bad. Can't go wrong with regular fries and the sweet potato tots are borderline a dessert. Drinks are pretty standard, but they offer a great selection. One caveat with Cowbell is the volume level. If you're there on a night where they chose the acoustic guitar player who thinks he's playing in an amphitheater, it's gonna be pretty damn noisy. I always describe this place as a \"gourmet burger joint that plays a shit ton of 90's music videos\". If you're not interested yet, I dunno what to tell you.",

Place was pretty empty... But it was a Wednesday night, so I expected there not to be noisy. However, there was a musician that was playing there that night. He was one of this one man bands. It was great!   I ordered a house whiskey with coke ($5.. Not bad!) and then a house whiskey on the rocks. Both were good... Expected for a house drink. I order d the F'in Tacos, which featured beef, pulled pork, beer cheese, and friend jalapenos. Got it with a side of Mac n cheese, cause ya know... Southern comfort!   Food came out pretty average as far as time goes. Tacos looked great, and tasted quite good. Mac n cheese left much to be desired. But, the tacos were tasty and not too filling.  I would for sure return. It was overall a good experience!  Go in confidence",

Took over 10 minutes to take my drink order.  When my boogens bacon burger came out all I can say is disappointing. The Patty itself look like a hockey puck the bun crunchy like they over-cooked it in the bacon way undercooked almost Raw.

    "text": "As far as the food goes, everyone in our party of 8 loved their tacos and burgers. The service is the downfall here. We called to try and get a reservation for 8 on a Saturday night at 7pm. The hostess said they don't do reservations on Saturday nights but ensured me they aren't busy until 8pm or that it wouldn't be too long if we came before then. We got there 5 minutes until 7pm and were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait, which I expected so it was totally fine. We went next door and had a drink while waiting for a text about our table. After 50 minutes of waiting we decided we should head back to cowbell since our table should have been ready by then. The hostess was rude and acted like she could care less about us waiting. We chose to keep waiting since it was 15 degrees outside and continued to watch her sit tables that she could have easily held for our party. Finally after over an hour and a half of waiting we were seated. An older man kept walking to the hostess stand and we figured he may have been a manager and apologized for us waiting 3 times longer than we were told, but he never said a word to us. It's sad that a place like this couldn't even offer an apology or a free appetizer for being so inconsiderate. Hire a hostess with a smile on her face who actual cares to be there instead of give snarky remarks and playing on her phone the whole night!",

I asked her for a beer recommendation and she brought me an excellent draft, as I was in the mood for something along the line of a Hefeweizen. Following that, I had the Sinatra,  prosciutto and pulled cheese appetizer. It comes with a little marinara sauce and really hit the spot. For my main entree I had trouble deciding but eventually settled on the NYC Burger cooked medium rare and let me just say it was amazing! It comes with sweet potato tots which I've never had before but I love.  I'll be back again before leaving Charlotte, as this place had excellent food.  My only complaint, was the music televisions but Sarah Beth explained that the earlier thunderstorms knocked out the regular tv.  Go earlier and they'll have sports on some.  But I didn't go here for television anyway and can't say enough about the quality of the food.",

They were perfectly cooked and there were seemingly endless topping options.  The atmosphere was everything you want in a mostly-inclusive \"hip\" joint. We saw a couple get seated then decide to leave because of the music volume. Cowbell welcomes everyone with open arms, but it might not necessarily be the right place for everyone.  If you find yourself hungry in the Charlotte area, make Cowbell a priority! It's something you will not regret.",

I always enjoy walking around and looking at everything they have up. The set up of the tvs are cool too! Love the music videos that play the whole time. I always enjoy a good throw back of foo fighters or blink 182! Can never go wrong with that :)  Service- incredible. Our server was so sweet and friendly. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and every section of it. Everyone works together and helps out. They are fast paced but I don't feel forgotten about. My drink never went empty, plates and napkins were brought immediately after ordering appetizers. They are just overall very on top of their job. Which I always appreciate. An unforgotten table is always a 20%+ tip!   Food- holy cowbell! It rang my bell. I got the Sinatra as a starter and was blown away. Everything is made in house from the sauce down to the mozzarella itself. You can't beat mozzarella that's hand pulled in house. The plate set up was nice too! Perfect amount of sauce. For my entree I got the boogans bacon. Uh hello!? Bacon marmalade, where have you been all my life?? It was the perfect amount of sweetness to make the burger impeccable. Hands down one of the best burgers I've had. Dessert I was told to get the velvet revolver. Which they said was a homemade red velvet cake crumble covered over ice cream.. Wait for it.. They DEEP FRIED IT!! OMG!! Life changing. You have to get.   Overall this is one of the best places uptown and I can't wait to go eat there again. Hopefully soon because \"I gotta fever and the only cure for it is more cowbell\"",

When you open a restaurant uptown you need to plan for capacity and know what events are happening. It is uptown, there is always an event happening. This restaurant has been open long enough to know it needs to be staffed appropriately on the weekends. If it's not, it's time to look at management.    The decor of the restaurant is cool and the 80's music was great. It was like dining inside Rock of Ages the musical. Which I personally think is awesome. I had the patty melt with sweet potato tots, which was good. It just wasn't hot. I feel like my burger had been done for a while but my friends was not so it had to wait on the counter. My husband's food came out with mine and his burger was also tasty but there was a 10 minute delay for us to receive our food and for the rest of the table to get theirs. We live in the south. You cannot start eating your food until everyone has gotten their plate. So everything was cold by the time we all got started.  I will give the waitress credit. She recognized the food was really slow to come out and comp'd our appetizer. That was actually very nice and the right thing to do.   With all of the new burger joints in Charlotte I don't know that I would suggest going back but I would not be against it if someone else wanted to go. At least I can say I have knocked it off my top 20 burger joints to try in Charlotte list.",

The selection of burgers was a little overwhelming, as they had at least 5 different burgers I wanted to try, but I went with one of their most popular one with their zesty cheese, bbq pulled pork, and fried jalapenos ontop all on a pretzel bun and yes, it was as good as it sounds. Overall, it was just a really really good burger.  It was cooked exactly to preference and they have a variety of sides including french fries seasoned with Parmesan cheese, large crispy onion rings, and sweet potato tater tots.   I had a look at their whiskey selection and although it was a little pricey for me, they had one of the largest selections. I sometimes wonder if the bold flavors of the burger would pair well with the whiskey, but the option of being able to have a scotch or a burger is always nice.  If you're looking for a unique burger, Cowbell is definitely one of a kind.",

    "text": "After hearing so much about Cowbell and my coworkers convincing me to go with them for lunch, I finally tried Cowbell.  The menu is extensive with about 20 different burgers that include: turkey, salmon and chicken patties. After being indecisive for about 10-15 minutes because the service is a little slow, I will say it was about 11:45 so I guess it was somewhat a lunch rush, I finally chose the Pilgrim burger. I was feeling like eating healthier that day so that was probably a bad decision on my part. The Pilgrim is a turkey patty on a honey wheat bun with brie cheese, apple and bourbon bbq sauce, and bacon. I ordered the sweet potato tots as a side. It was 7 people in our party but we waited for our food for a good while, which is somewhat expected with a larger party.   Sadly, I wasn't wowed with my burger. It was just bland to me even with bbq sauce and bacon. Even though I ordered a turkey burger, the patty was not thick or juicy at all and just kind of dry. I've had juicier and more flavorful turkey patties. The only thing that saved my meal was the sweet potato tots! I loved them, they were coated in cinnamon sugar and really sweet. I will say the sweet potato tots are one of the best in town especially since you don't even need a sauce with them.  I will give this place another chance and order an actual beef patty next time with an order of sweet potato tots for sure!",

    "text": "Don't let the option for late night hours fool you, they aren't about that life. We arrived at a little before 11pm because they advertise open till 2am. It was not crowded at all, which initially I was excited about considering how hungry I was. However, after sitting there about 15mins with no service and waiters looking at us look at them, like is it you or can it please be you. We finally asked a waitress and she \"agreed\" to be our waiter. That's neither here nor there because after she took our order we noticed the kitchen door was propped opened because the staff was watching the fight. Needless to say NO ONE had on a hair net, gloves or anything that would seem logical while cooking food. Nor did they seemed to be concerned with eating their meals in the kitchen while taking forever to cook mine. So perhaps that should have been que #3 for me to leave but too hungry lol! So the burger comes and although I typically order my burgers medium I specifically asked for well done this go round and my friend asked for medium (he's adventurous lol). I had the Bruiser which sounded like it should have been juicy with all these mouthwatering toppings. It was dry and my well done burger was cooked medium. My friend who ordered medium basically received ground beef uncooked on a bun, the meat was as pink as his tomato. Fries and tots might as well have still been frozen. About this time when we got out food the guys in the kitchen had packed up and left (12ish). So I dare not asked for fresh fries but our waitress did manage to get hot fries to us and get someone to make a burger for my friend. So maybe when this horrid adventure fades my memory I will try Cowbell again because I'm the past when I have come during the week this wasn't an issue but definitely an experience this weekend.",

    "text": "So it seems Cowbell needs some training, practice and maybe some direction on handling a large group of people. There were 10 people in my group, so I'll venture to say that this restaurant is ill prepared in handling groups larger than say 4 people. That's unfortunate because they have such great potential. Let's recap positives and negatives, shall we?....  Good: after we walked in without a reservation, the hostess was very accommodating with seating our group. Although we arrived at around 1130, so there were only two other tables of 2-3 people. We were immediately seated, and were almost immediately asked for our drink orders after a few minutes of browsing the menu.  Aight: the food. I had an over east egg on my burger and it came out busted. So there was egg yolk all on the bottom bun and plate, and I know I know, it was going to happen anyway, but I wanna be the one to bust my egg. Other than that, the burger had decent flavor. It has potential.   My drink was aight. It tastes like a regular ginger beer. There was a slight hint of grapefruit but I had to suck on my own tongue to taste it. Wasn't worth the price.   On to the issues.   Mistake #1: our sever was impatient and seemed to have a light attitude. She wasn't really all that friendly, she didn't offer any suggestions, and my whole table noticed. She's lucky we left when we did cause my Godmother and Mother (both native NY'ers) seemed like they were pretty close to hurting her feelings)  Mistake #2: majority of the table had cold food. My burger was lukewarm and the fries were close to being cold. I was starving. Hadn't eaten all day. Did not have time for them to bring out a new burger and probably nuke the fries. So I choked it down.   Mistake #3: My dude asked for ranch for his wings. He got one blue cheese and one ranch. When he told her he had blue cheese, she was like, \"the other one is ranch\" but why would you bring out blue cheese??? Does that make sense? Is it just me? He didn't ask for one of each. Just ranch. That wasn't hard. Now it doesn't sound like that big of deal but when you add up all of the above, and don't even ask if he needs another ranch because you clearly brought out two containers of sauce because he would need it for the amount of wings he has, why even bother to bring out something that wasn't requested???  I usually let one or two things go by without a fuss and maybe the fact this was my graduation lunch and it wasn't all that great, had my senses heightened. Who knows? I might give it another try with one or two other people. Might.",

The place has that leathery lounge feel with an element of rich/money flare.  Tables are stacked close together with booths lining the walls. Very small.  We were a party of 7 so our wait at 12:00 was about 10 min.

Nice thick piece of meat! I also got the cucumber salad and it was very good.    Prices are no joke, though.  My burger was a whopping 12 bucks.  0_o.   That's all I am going to say about that.

    "text": "I was torn here between 3 and 4 stars but, with only one lunchtime visit under my belt, I landed on the 4.    The 4 worthy aspects:  Service -  Ate at the bar and it was friendly and fast.  Taste of the burger - Had one with caramelized onions, gorgonzola, garlic aioli, shredded lettuce and it had a nice combo of sweet and tart and savory it also came with shitake's which I declined.  Atmosphere - A little dark (in a good way) with cool art and those bangin' 80's MTV videos playing on a big screen.  Just an interesting place to look around and soak in.  The closer to 3 items: Burger to bun ratio - While the burger was thick and tasted great, there was way too much onion kaiser encircling the burger.  At least 3/4 of an inch of a bun rim around the whole thing.  Burger Temp - In that, I was not asked how I would like it cooked.  I'm not sure if this is the standard practice and they simply cook everything to medium-well (which is what I got) but, given the choice and the recently enlightened NC rules on the topic, medium-rare is what I would generally order.    While I would not drive down here from LKN to get a burger given the number of good options up this way, I can absolutely see myself walking to Cowbell for lunch again or perhaps meeting a group after work for some drinks and an early, beef-centric meal.",

The bar was pushed back, further from the door, leaving ample room for mingling and table seating, and the vibe is hipper too, with tufted leather chairs and low red lighting.  My favs:  Cowbell Chili & Smoked Cornbread, black bean burger, sweet potato croquettes, which are basically sweet potato donuts balls (or little balls of heaven, as Cowbell calls them), and Dali's fries with garlic aioli, buffalo, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.

Everything was to die for! I had the black bean burger and it was easily one of the best ones I have ever had (I'm kind of a black bean burger snob). They really think through all of their flavor combinations to bring very unique flavors to all of their burgers and all of their food/drinks. My husband and I also enjoyed their alcoholic shakes, oh my goodness they were so amazing!! You have to have one whenever you go to complete your meal! I also adored the atmosphere in here with the tribute to everything bad ass in the 80's! I can't want to come back!",

    "text": "Review Summary: Get yourself the sweet potato tots NOW! Everything else is just decent. I stopped in for lunch today and ordered the PM Burger, which comes topped with pulled pork, beer cheese, and deep fried jalapenos. The burger patty itself was cooked perfectly to medium as I asked but was surprisingly a little dry and lacked flavor on its own. The onion Kaiser bun was okay but nothing special either. The toppings on the burger were what made it good though. The pulled pork added solid bbq flavor but was also a little dry unfortunately. The beer cheese was awesome, and balanced the bbq pork and beef patty perfectly. The deep fried jalapenos were limited in number and weren't breaded very much (which I'm glad about), and they provided a decent level of spice and another complimentary flavor. The toppings made the burger pretty good but not great; if the bun and meat quality had been better this burger would've been killer! The best part of the meal was by far the sweet potato tots! I love sweet potato fries, and these were probably the best I've ever had. They were sweeter than most places with a hint of cinnamon, crispy outside but with a normal texture in the middle- outstanding! The service was decent and my food came out quickly. The atmosphere seemed like it would be pretty cool, especially at night, and the location has a very large bar but not a ton of tables, which I guess should be expected from a place with \"Whiskey Bar\" in its name. One last piece of advice to totally drive the point home: order the sweet potato tots; don't even consider another side. Yes, they're that good and were definitely the highlight of the meal.",

Guys, you are a burger joint.  It is in your name!!!  You have to cook the burgers as requested.  Cmon!  The burger list is pretty impressive.  Other weird thing, they are a burger and whiskey bar, but when you look at the drink menu, there is not a whiskey list....  um, ok.  Also, I ordered sweet potato tots as my side and they were soft and pillowy.  Um....  crispy would have been better.   Sounds like I hated this place so why the 3 stars?   This place cranks great music!!  Soundgardens Rusty Cage is cranking out as I sit at the bar and write this review :).",

Same for the Disco Fries (good gravy, meh the rest, needed salt). Service was...fine, our waitress forgot about us but was nice when she was around. THE BAD: AWFUL mac & cheese. They should be ashamed to have it on the menu. Poor rectangular noodle choice, grainy sauce, icky cheese combo. I sent it back when we finally caught our waitress' attention before leaving. Swapped for slaw, which was not as good as you'd expect a claw to be which is named after a person. BOTTOM LINE: I'm glad I went here with my family and not my boyfriend. There's too many other burger & alcohol joints in Charlotte to bother returning.",

Sat down and the waiter was very chatty, talking about sports and good beer suggestions. We both ordered and our drinks and food came out fairly quickly. I got the bacon burger with bacon and bacon jam along with the sweet potato tator tots. I have literally NEVER had better sweet potato tator tots in my life, no exaggeration. They didn't need any condiments and they were almost dessert like! The burger itself was a bit dry but tasty, all it needed was some ketchup. However, our waiter was nowhere to be found. None of the tables had ketchup on it and you couldn't catch any of the waiters in general. Finally, after 2/3 of the burger consumed and 25 minutes since we last saw the guy, our waiter rushed by while quickly over his shoulder yelling \"do you guys need anything else\" as he headed out the door. Dude, are you serious? I practically had to trap him near our table. If it wasn't for the lacking service, I would have definitely given this place a 4.5 star!",

We have had drinks there many times, but on this particular day we were craving greasy and fried.  We started off with the Deviled Eggs and Fried Pickles. The eggs were great- a little salty prosciutto complimented the creamy filling. The fried pickles were an enormous serving, with just the right amount of crispy batter.  For lunch, we all agreed on the Higher Ground. This chicken sandwich comes either grilled or fried- we chose the latter. It's smothered in pimento cheese (my favorite), and topped with bacon, greens and garlic aoli. This sandwich is huge, and absolutely delicious. For a side, I chose the sweet potato tots. Perfect portion, crispy with a sweet & salty finish.  The bartender (I believe her name was Lindsey) was on point. She was very busy but kept our drinks filled and was a pleasure to chat with.  Keep up the good work, guys!",

They have a main dining area right next to the bar that has about 5-10 TVs displaying different sporting events as well as music videos. Service seemed to be pretty slow as it was pretty crowded but also it looked like they were light on staff.  The menu is a little diverse for mainly being a burger joint as they also have tacos, salads, chicken sandwiches, and appetizers. We opted for the burgers of course which they have quite a selection. I chose the Boogan's Bacon which came with bacon, bacon marmalade, and a roasted garlic aioli spread. All the burgers also come with a side that can be onion rings, french fries, mac n cheese, and others. Our food came out relatively quickly given how slow the service had been.  As for the burger, it was really good but I think it was the garlic aioli that made it stand out. It was nicely sized and definitely juicy but came with a small side of fries. Overall, it was a nice casual spot to watch some football and eat some good food!",

    "text": "Do you like whiskey? moscow mules? burgers? Cowbell is your one stop shop for all of these and more! I LOVED the interior of this restaurant/bar. It was classy and welcoming, yet not too bougie. There are several tables, but also a good sized bar area if that's what you're looking for.  At first we came here for the alcoholic milkshakes, but after seeing the extensive moscow mule menu, we quickly changed our minds.  Mules are my jam, so you could imagine how hard it was to choose one!   -Cucumber mule: refreshing twist on your standard! The cucumber was subtle, but enough to give the drink a good twist. My favorite out of the ones I tried! -Melon mule: a little too sweet for me. They use the melon grey goose, and the taste was a little overpowering  -Irish mule: whiskey instead of vodka! Better version of a whiskey ginger ale  They have whiskeys from ALL OVER, and while I'm no whiskey connoisseur, I learned quite a bit just from reading the menu lol  They also have a huge food menu. Too many choices, and again we had a hard time deciding.   -Pretzel bites: fried pretzel dough was good while hot, but got a little too hard when it cooled down. Cheese sauce is REALLY good though! Best shared with more than 2 people  -Ronstandt wrap: you sold me at avocado! also comes with chicken, black beans, corn. And...SWEET POTATO TATER TOTS!  Pro tip: DIP IN CHEESE SAUCE! mmmm so so good  -Disco fries: omg droooool poutine. Everything mixed well- fries, gravy, mushrooms, cheese curds. Mushrooms added a really nice layer to the dish and it didn't get too soggy! Or maybe that was just us stuffing our faces in an efficient manner...  One of our best decisions while visiting Charlotte!",

    "text": "(More like 3.5 stars)  \"I got a fever...and the only prescription is more cowbell!\" (Am I the first to reference the SNL cowbell skit in a review for Cowbell?)  'A friend and I tried this place out last night (a Saturday) and it was a good time! Granted, the place is very tight on space. Forget having much conversational privacy here - it ain't gon' happen, my friend. There is a large-ish L-shaped bar for your multiple TV screen viewing pleasure. Also, there's a small outside eating area in front of the restaurant  We showed up around 6:00 and it was beginning to get busy. We both decided to have bottles of angry ale cider (cold and crisp!) and I went the chicken sandwich route. I ordered Vince's cowbell with a side of house fries. My food arrived and I was surprised that the sandwich (and my friend's burger) was on the smaller side. With Cowbell being known as burger bar, I was expecting heftier portions but that's not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation.  The chicken sandwich was very good. Slightly spicy and the chicken was juicy. Big plus with it being served on a wheat bun. My friend was also very pleased with her burger. Not exactly which one she ordered since she asked the waitress to bring a burger with a list of her favorite toppings! The fries were good just not anything memorable. They could stand to be a little crispier.  I decided to try one of their desserts - the velvet revolver - and was SORELY mistaken in doing so. It's a dessert that's described on their website as \"fried ice cream with red velvet cake mix, chocolate sauce, and house buttercream.\" Truly, this was the worst dessert I've ever had in a restaurant. There wasn't an ounce of red velvet nor chocolate flavor to be found. The ice cream was coated in this beady, crumbly dark coating that had NO FLAVOR. Well, actually it had a weird greasy taste to it. We let the waitress know and the manager, Aaron, came over and profusely apologized and kindly took the dessert off of our bill. As a nice gesture, he sent over red velvet flavored shots for us.   Overall, the service was extremely friendly, pleasant, and accommodating. The food, there are some improvements to be made but the restaurant has a fun ambiance and makes for a nice place to grab a drink.",

Vegans included.  3rd: the waitresses and bar mistresses are super fly beautimous - if you are a guy, please don't stare as your girlfriend or spouse will likely hit you. You wouldn't stare at the sun, would you?  4th: this place gets hopping on the weekends - so if you like eating and sitting at the same time - make a reservation!  5th: you will be back for more, but this time dressed as Bret Michaels, leather chaps, cowboy hat and mascara.  This place is super awesome! Give me a Kitchen Sink, the Sinatra and a Boogan's Bacon any day of the week!!! You have been warned! Carry on!",

    "text": "I ended up here with a group of about 20 people, so I'll admit that my experience might not have been totally representative of Cowbell.  However, general issues that come with being a large group aside (and hmmm, they seemed quite practiced with handing out 20 separate checks...), a few things really bothered me.  1. I understand that a restaurant cannot control what people on the street choose to do.  However, being asked for money while sitting outside is not a pleasant experience, and reinforced my decision to not leave the group (even though I was pretty tired and really just wanted to get back to my hotel ASAP).  2. You can order any burger naked, which is great for those of us on a low-carb diet.  Except, without the bun, the Big Will's breakfast burger just looked small and sad on the plate, and was ultimately pretty darn meh.  Not much there for $13.  3. The food I received did not quite match what the menu said.  My supposed over easy egg was definitely hard and if there was honey mustard on there, I didn't find it.  I didn't think \"hold the red onion\" meant that...  4. The cucumber salad was at first pleasantly vinegary and tart, but after a few bites, it became almost intolerable.  I'm all for flavor, but yikes.  5. As another reviewer mentioned, the ladies' room is a single-use and uncomfortably situated by the kitchen.  Not a nice place to wait in the inevitable line.  Plus it was super loud inside, leaving me wanting to curl up with my hands over my ears.  So given the vast number of other restaurants in the vicinity, do yourself a favor and pass up another mediocre, overpriced burger.",

We ordered the cheese sticks and it came out cold(ice cold), our burgers came out each missing something we requested (cheese,a bun,lettuce etc) and was cooked improperly when we brought it to their attention they did not apologize not fix it. I'm sure this isn't a common experience at this establishment but unfortunately I will not be returning nor recommending.",

    "text": "Cowbell is one of the most mediocre, overrated, subpar restaurants in Uptown. My boyfriend lives a block away so out of convenience we've been here many times. Every time I want to like it and have a better experience and every time it's almost laughable how bad the service and food are. I've decided I won't be going back and it's time to write a review. The main problem is poor management. I assume the owners have never been around when I've dined here because there is absolutely zero quality control. It's crazy that they spend so much time and money on Public Relations to get people in the door then grossly under deliver. I see a lot of their advertising and features especially in local magazines. Don't fall for it, readers.    Here is a list of the problems I've noticed:  1. Problems start when you walk in. The ambiance is off. Music is always too loud to hear yourself think and they don't show the games that every other bar is showing. Hope you prefer 80s music videos to the Panthers game.  2. Hostess has forgotten to tell the server that she sat us a few times (different hostesses). This is particularly a problem if you sit outside (sat by the hostess). They will forget about you and won't know you're there.  3. Last time I went we waited 15 min before getting drinks and had to go ask them to send a server. In the same meal we also had to ask for a spoon for coffee and silverware about 3 times.  4. Food quality is inconsistent at best. You never know if your food will be under or over cooked or flat out burned. We've had burnt burgers, burnt chicken, burnt bread in appetizer, burnt hamburger buns etc. We've been served cold fries, cold sweet potato tots without the seasoning and cold coffee (during Sunday brunch)  5. Despite an extensive menu, nothing is particularly good. The menu should be re evaluated. Many items are too heavy, too sweet, too much weird sauce or too much bread. Especially the veggie selections are bad but also everything. And everything tastes the same.  6. Orders are wrong a lot. Sometimes this works in your favor (free pickle chips!) sometimes it doesn't. Worst case scenario they will take it off the bill if they mess something up too badly.  7. When things go wrong, staff doesn't apologize. But other random bus boys and staff may awkwardly check in with your table to overcompensate for the ignoring lack of service during the first half of your visit.  8. The burgers aren't good. This is a problem at a burger place. You're better off going to 5guys.  9. It's really overpriced  10. Don't get the salads. They serve them full of rotten lettuce.   I'm sure there are more examples but this should give you an idea. I hope the owners read this because last time I came here I literally thought, these people need to be on Restaurant Takeover. The place has potential but not at all in its current state.",

I was informed by two different people that on Saturday, it would be validated for the day. When time to leave the parking deck, the ticket was validated for only 3 hours. The entire party had to pay for parking, when informed it was validated for the entire day. I called to complain and the hostest would only say \"it's just 3 hours\" repeatedly. She didn't apologize or seem to care. Horrible customer service.",

Our food never made it to us on time and we ended up just having to pay for our glasses of wine and going to the concert with empty stomachs.  The second time we went there, we were told it would be an hour wait for four people.  So we ditched and went down the street to Rockbottom instead where they were able to seat us immediately.

My go to is the dumpling burger or the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Sometimes the chicken is a bit over cooked, but the great sauce makes up for it.  The sides are good, if you are watching calories, give the naked burger with cucumber salad a go - leaves you satisfied without feeling over stuffed - good to have options like that in a burger joint!",

The location is very close to the Bank of America parking deck, and is next door to the Roxbury  and two doors down from Dandelion Market. It occupies the space where Nix once was, but the sign is hard to see in the dark.   The table was a little crammed for four girls so I couldn't imagine if there were 4 guys trying to battle for space. Good luck. Our waitress was nice and took our orders right away. I was feeling adventurous so I got Big Wills Breakfast. It's a burger with candied bacon, and an over easy egg and cheese on a croissant. It also comes with onions and lettuce, but I decided to go without, because I had read that it just makes the burger gigantic. I ordered fries as my side. The other girls ordered the Mexicali hot dog and the Popeye burger.   When we got our food, I was eyeballing everyone else and I was so excited about my food. Lucky for me the excitement was well warranted. It was delicious! I am so excited to bring my husband back because they had really good beer specials as well (and $4 ciders for those of us who don't drink beer). He's excited too because he got to reap the benefits of my leftovers and can't wait to try out the hot and fresh burgers in person!",

    "text": "Our latest outing started with a coin toss between Basil Thai Cuisine or Cowbell Burger & Bar. We flipped our shiny quarter, the coin landed (heads up), and it was off to Cowbell we went. Cowbell is located in Uptown Charlotte next to Dandelion Market (which we love) in the former Nix Burger location... only a few steps away from the Epicentre.  We always find it odd when a restaurant closes and the same type opens in its spot. So when Cowbell (BURGERS) opened up in the old Nix (BURGERS) I was already a little skeptical. Then I found out Cowbell was created by the same people that brought us Mortimers Pub and Leroy Fox. So... I guess I became a little excited and only a few minutes after leaving our house and driving circles around Uptown to find a parking spot we were finally at the front door.  The decor could easily be described (by Curtis) as modern American Rock 'n' Roll with chic decor and a very Uptown feel. When we walked in the first thing I got excited about was the abundance of lighting and I was certain I would be able to get some good photos. My biggest complaint about every restaurant we visit is that they are all too dark. I don't know who created the concept that dim lighting is hip but I hate it and if there are any restaurant owners reading this... TURN ON THE DAMN LIGHTS!!!! My initial joy with Cowbell was quickly diminished after a few minutes when the lights went dim and my photos turned to crap :(  We kicked off the night by heeding our waiters suggestion and we got the Sweet Potato Croquettes with Spiced Honey Butter. These guys were so awesome I was having a hard time sharing with Ella. They had an exterior crust, size, and appearance of a typical hushpuppy but were dusted lightly with cinnamon and sugar. The sweet potato interior was super soft, almost a little creamy, and had the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the crunchy exterior.  Cowbells artisan burgers are created with a combination of chuck and brisket then hand ground by a 4th generation butcher. The burger list is diverse and choosing one proved to be a monumental tast (even by a professional burger eater like me). After hours and hours (or a couple minutes) of intense examination of ingredient combinations and careful consideration about time, location, weather, and the rotation of the moon... I finally decided to get the NYC Burger.  Being the highly accredited burger connoisseur that I am I take burgers very seriously and I loved this burger. The chuck and brisket beef wasn't anything notable especially after eating a Pat LaFrieda burger but the combination of burger with pastrami, aged swiss, sauerkraut, and Cowbell sauce was truly blissful. I loved the burger / deli sandwich combination and had great admiration for the chef that married these ingredients under the lightly toasted onion kaiser.  The burgers come with a side item and despite them all sounding delicious and very tempting I opted to upgrade my side (additional charges may apply) to the Dali's Fries. The photo below is the only photo that was even halfway decent once the lights dimmed but you can aptly see the fries covered in a garlic aioli, parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, and plenty of buffalo sauce. The Dali fries were absolutely delicious and I ate every last bite... but with that said... the fries had way too much buffalo sauce.  Don't get me wrong, I love buffalo sauce and the hotter the better in almost every instance. For the Dali fries it was too much because it nearly completely masked the garlic aioli, parmesan cheese, and any of the herbs that may have been there.  Cowbell is a welcome addition to Uptown Charlotte and absolutely a welcome addition to Charlotte's ever expanding burger scene. We cant wait to go back and can easily recommend Cowbell for your next burger craving :)",

She was so genuine and sweet and worked in a timely manner. She even charged my phone behind the bar for me since it was dead ! The food was awesome. They were only serving brunch but the kitchen let me order a veggie burger that was the best I've ever had!!! If you go here ask for amanda she will take wonderful care of you!    Ashley & chris -",

I can't have tomato or onion so I went with the burger that had the least items & no onion bun, the wills, which is on a croissant with bacon and a fried egg.  You need to be able to unhinge your jaw to get the bun in your mouth, I gave up halfway through and just cut bits off the burger with a fork.  We also ordered the pretzel bites as an appetizer, which are basically very crispy frozen pretzel bits.    The wall decorations are clearly aimed at hipsters & wanna be hipsters (painted deer heads) and there was a weird tv situation going on where the 2 main TVs, which were in my direct eyesight, were on music videos but they didn't match up with what was playing on the speakers.  Rather odd & kept throwing me off.    Don't expect to get out of here cheap, it was over $40 for an app, 2 burgers & 1 beer.  If you're looking for a good burger go to Kickstand instead.  Better vibe, better burgers & better beer.",

I called in a to go order at exactly 7:45 and was told it would be 15-20 minutes.  Upon my arrival at 8:02 it hadn't been placed yet.  Now I am understanding at this point because accidents happen...however the order was placed at 8:06 and I didn't receive my food until 8:42.  Again I would have been fine with this had the manager not come out and been a complete jerk.  His attitude when he told me \"well technically you have only been waiting 26 minutes\" was unacceptable.  Yes my meal was comped as it should have been and again accidents happen but the managers disregard and attitude coupled with the last few visits being less than satisfactory AND when getting home seeing that my order was WRONG has turned me away from this restaurant for good.   Oh well...bad daddy's it is!!",

I came here on a Friday night with the husband after much indecision about where to eat. We easily snagged two seats at the bar and ordered a martini (for him) and OMB Copper (for me) while we perused the extensive menu. Hubby was happy that the bar was stocked with Titos vodka for his martini, and even happier with the huge spread of meaty sandwich options.   We decided on the sliders and deviled eggs to start, followed by a spicy chicken sandwich and salad. Everything was outrageously delicious with the sweet potato tots and sliders stealing the show. The tots seemed to be lightly dusted in cinnamon sugar and were like little donuty pillows of heaven. Holy yum.   New favorite spot, we will be back soon.",

    "text": "We came here during a weekend visit in Charlotte. I'll start by saying, being vegan in downtown Charlotte is challenging. We decided to come to Cowbell since they had, not one, but two \"non meat\" burgers on the menu. Previous reviews described this place as \"hipster\" which is just cute. It's one of the most un-hipster places I've been too. It's more like Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters met a nice interior decorator. We were sat immediately and that's where the good stops in this review (I lie, there's one more thing). It took forever to be greeted. By the time we were seated, we obviously knew what we wanted: Jett burgers, no cheese,  sweet potato tots and a beer.  A few minutes later my beer was delivered and a whopping  50 minutes later our black bean burgers came out. 50 minutes. For black bean burgers. First bite... Barely luke warm. If my food is going to take that long, I'd like for it to be at least hot. The burger itself seemed like it was simply black beans smashed up. Like imagine a whole can of black beans smashed up, formed into a pattie and that's Cowbells version. The only saving grace was the sweet potato tots. Those little babies almost made the rest of the meal worth while. All in all, if you just want to hang in a cool place and drink some beers, this might be just fine. I wasn't too happy, and I really wouldn't give it my recommendation.",

It was because there was a large \"To Go\" order for 30 called in. Unfortunately, they admitted that they knew it was too much so it led to seated guests suffering. They apologized and offered free burgers for the next time. My only advice to the manager was if you know you can't handle the business at the same time try to manage the \"To-Go\" earlier or later or say no to the order if you can't change the timing.

    "text": "Great Food, Worst Service I've Received in a Long Time  I love the food here. I want to start by saying that because I would definitely get food from them again. We were not a large party, 4 adults, one kid in a highchair. Despite having many vegetarian options on the menu, when I asked about specific items not specified as veggie to see if they had meat in them our waiter seemed mystified. He responded both times with \"I don't think so\", and when I asked him to check with kitchen about one item (beer cheese for the pretzels) he looked like it was a major inconvenience. When he came back, simply told us the beer cheese contains dairy. Which is fine (and obvious) but does not answer the question I asked.   Our burgers were great but our waiter only came back to the table after taking our order twice. The other staff member that dropped off our food asked if we needed anything else. We said we were waiting to order drinks but could wait until our waiter came back to table. He offered to put in the drinks for us and took our order but the drinks never showed up. When our waiter finally came back in the middle of our meal he asked how we wanted to pay for the check (he didn't ask if we needed anything or if our food was correct) The last time he stopped by was to drop it off.     I don't blame the restaurant for this at all but we also had a window table and there was a cop car with lights flashing through the entire meal parked on the sidewalk. This isn't the restaurants fault but they also never offered to close the shades or do anything at all to help.  Overall, I love their food, would have loved to try some of their drinks, but I will never take out of town guests to this restaurant again.",

Moreover, the food is on point! Great burger selection, and they encourage you to play around with the menu. Great beer selection as well, and the service is attentive and friendly, unlike many uptown locations. Their Mac n Cheese is not to be missed as a side item, and the fried pretzels: DOPE!  Will keep coming back ~ Thanks Cowbell!",

The whiskey selection is one of the largest in Charlotte, which my boyfriend thoroughly enjoys.  The staff is always friendly and willing to suggest their favorites or any recent additions to their selection.  Overall a great atmosphere, very eclectic decor including two screens playing music videos ranging with all age classic hits from the 60s-90s.   My standard order ranges from the Fiesta Tacos to the Lisa Marie Chicken Sandwich (sometimes in a wrap), and I am quick to suggest the Mac and Cheese or Sweet Potato Tots for side choices.  As far as the burgers I've tried a number of them and none have disappointed!",

Their starter menu is huge, they've got a good selection of tacos and wraps, and their burger menu reigns supreme. From a classic Elvis Burger, to one of my favorites the SodaPop (bbq beef, sriracha grilled prosciutto, onion straws, gruyere cheese, chipotle ketchup) and even the Big Will's Breakfast (croissant roll, over easy egg, praline smoked bacon, honey mustard).

Unfortunately, nothing we've ordered ever quite delivers the punch we're expecting. Don't get me wrong, nothing here is bad, it's just never as mind blowing as I hope it'll be.   The onion rings or sweet potato tots are both solid side choices. Of the burgers I've tried, the Bruiser (gorgonzola, horseradish, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions) and Jimmy's Page (turkey burger with apples, bacon, cheddar, pineapple sriracha) are my favorites. Next time I'm back, I'll probably try my burger of choice \"naked\" (sans bun) as all the bread I've had there is huge and kinda dry.",

At 6pm on a weeknight, we had no issue getting a table. The decor is colorful and edgy and the place has a pretty cool vibe overall.  As for the food, I was actually pretty disappointed in my meal. I ordered the Danny Tacos with a side of the cucumber salad. The tacos are described on menu as having crumbled turkey patty, avocado, smoked habanero cheese, iceberg leaf lettuce, house pico, and chipotle aioli. My issue was the texture. The \"crumbled\" turkey patty was more like mashed turkey and then with the melted cheese on top, it basically turned to turkey mush/pate. There was also way too much of the mush on the small soft tortilla, so everything came oozing out the sides. It wasn't pretty to eat and the flavor was only ok. As for the cucumber salad, it was just a little heavy on the vinegar for my taste.",

The bun and bacon were not included, as requested, but neither was the fresh avocado that was supposed to be part of the plate.  The lemon aioli was underneath the fries, rendering the fries soggy and the aioli unable to be used on the chicken. I don't know if the kitchen staff was tired but my meal left a lot to be desired.

The burgers are gourmet, so don't expect a greasy, messy cheeseburger. They have about 12+ different options- plus build your own- but the Danny California turkey burger is my favorite!! And the pilgrim with apple, bacon and Brie is also a top contender. However, you can't really go wrong with any of them!   I actually get more excited for the sides rather than the burgers. The cucumber salad is awesome and refreshing. Hands down my favorite site option. And the sweet potato tots are also very good. Also ask for a side of ranch with them :)",

    "text": "Do you hear that? The bells are ringing! The Carolina definitely rung my bell today. I just had it with some side salad and thousand island dressing. It was great! Like I told my friend Ryan, it's actually better than the BLT steak burger I had at BLT Steakhouse two lunches ago.  The beef patty was cooked just right - medium rare of course. I could tell it was good meat. And the warm, soft buns... Yes, they were good too. The chili slaw that distinguishes the Carolina sandwiches? Oh, man, they're good too! So bottom line, nothing bad to say about it. It was even the right size for me to hold the whole thing and bite through unlike some high end sandwiches that gets too messy if you try to do that.  Now, service? Yes, it's just as important as the food in many cases. And this place did not disappoint. The crew was hard working, serious but friendly and nice. Most importantly, they weren't too intrusive. Very important for me. So, yeah, although Ryan picked this place because it's connected to his office building, I will be back for more. Maybe I'll try all of them.",

And if you do order them, don't make the mistake of putting them anywhere near the off-brand ketchup they'll provide you with.    Ultimately though, I think this illustrates what's amiss at cowbell -- it just feels confused. Is cowbell a casual restaurant, or a bar? Their menu is very \"creative\", with some burgers which are definitely exceptional and many others which fall flat. The menu is largely standard pub fare, with a pastiche of more exotic ingredients thrown into every other dish. The restaurant itself reinforces this trend: inside there's quite literally a bar in the middle of an otherwise unremarkable mid-sized burger joint.   In the end, although I enjoyed my time at cowbell, it's not a very reliable place to get food and didn't stand out much as a bar in an area with so many of them.",

First the atmosphere is, as other reviews say, very cool with a music theme, with music videos playing on a big screen tv and wall decor of album covers and posters (Farrah faucet and Robert plant).  To me it was odd (and a surprise) that a \"try to be bad ass burger bourbon bar\" would play Justin Bieber and Beyonce videos, (but I'm  sure that is just me).  Anyway, the ambience is warm and cool- the music is just alright.     The bourbon selections and variety was great- reminded me and husband of a few awesome days spent in Louisville!    We sat at the bar where the service was pleasant and prompt.  We both ordered burgers- one well and one medium.  Sides were fries and Mac & cheese.  When the burgers arrived we both commented about the smaller size for the price and both were well done.  Also, not a great burger flavor for the quality of meat advertised.  The onion roll on my burger seemed stale since it was crumbly.  Sides were alright, nothing noteworthy.    So, to sum up...fun atmosphere, great bourbon, alright over priced burger, good service (but be warned...the bartender presented our food and drinks with a \"Ta-Dah\" each time, and she sang along with the videos as well- if that is your thing, you will love it)",

Walking in, the decor seems like a dark, but cleaner NYC pub with ample seating and a Southern vibe.  Big Wills Breakfast Burger - Because when is the next time you will get to eat a burger with and egg and bacon on a CROISSANT roll? The name of the burger speaks for itself, but I can never turn down breakfast items. The menu of burgers is large a may take a while to read, but there's a decent selection for everyone.  The multiple big screens behind the bar are viewable from every angle of the restaurant. The only that was lacking was a Panthers game (they had a bye week) while I was in town. The Southern vibe and service are definitely friendly and this place lives up to it's higher Yelp rating in its area.",

After spending more than 10 minutes narrowing down my options, I finally settled on the outstanding NYC Burger, topped with pastrami, sauerkraut and the restaurant's wonderful Cowbell sauce. Served with a delicious side of fries and a cold draft beer from the extensive selection of local craft brews, the meal was about as close to hamburger perfection as you can get.   The service was prompt and friendly, the music just loud enough to hold a conversation over, and the upbeat, exciting atmosphere welcoming for both young families with kids and hip young professionals trying to impress a date. Cowbell is a fantastic addition to the Uptown restaurant scene, and one I hope stays around for a long time to come.",

Food: I tried the Carolina Burger with sweet potato tots, as per the Yelp reviews. Was really great! Loved that 5th St Chili! I'm not a burger person but I would definitely come back to try out more menu items. I love sweet potato, but I felt like these were a little too sweet. I don't like to add sugar at all to sweet potato. So if you're someone who doesn't like a sweetened sweet potato, I'd probably skip this and try something else. Next time I might try to S'more Shake! My colleague had that and it looked delicious!  Service: Service was friendly.  Environment: The decor was really interesting. Very quirky. Music was very loud though. It was a little hard to talk to my colleague.  Overall, food was solid. I'd definitely recommend to try if you're in town!",

My girlfriend and I split a burger with BBQ on top and had a side of the sweet potato tots.  Shared the tots with some friends also on the bar crawl, and everybody appreciated.  Burger was juicy and BBQ on top added some nice flavor.  Washed everything down with a Moscow Mule in a copper cup.  Definitely a hipster place with a high price tag, but food is good and ambience is nice.  Have to come back and try again when eating a full meal.",

    "text": "I need more Cowbell!  I'm sure you are dazzled by my creativity...but not nearly as dazzled as I am by the new Uptown burger joint Cowbell.  Their location is pretty bold, located just a few storefronts down from Basil and Dandelion Market, Cowbell had to be good to stand up to those two Charlotte staples.    We've visited Cowbell a few key times for dining in Charlotte, once on an early Thursday afternoon and again for a late Saturday night dinner before a show.  Upon the second visit, it was clear that they maintain consistent and high quality service.    The hostess and servers we had both times were friendly, helpful, and outgoing.  There was no quick glancing down at a pad of paper when we asked about the beer list and they asked which type I would like when I ordered a Maker's on the rocks.  It is impressive for your servers to be as knowledgeable as your bartenders. They also have these delightful ice spheres...it makes you feel just as excited as a five year old with a swirly straw.  The drinks are very reasonably priced...another great example of \"you get what you pay for\".  Plus the variety of choices are huge...if you want it...they should have it.   Moving on to the food. Again the service staff shines in the ordering process.  The recommendations we received both times were absolutely delicious.  Don't you dare leave that place without trying to the fried pickles.  The thickness of the pickle slices, the excellent batter that created one of the best crunches I've bitten, and of course a light but delicious ranch dressing makes this a dish you absolutely cannot pass up.   The drinks and the pickles are just a tease until you get to the burgers, chicken sandwiches, and hot dogs.  If you are a burger lover...this is your place.  The menu will please frat boys looking for the basic cheeseburger to foodies who will fawn over the Umami or Asian Burger.  The quality of meat is outstanding and I've never had one cooked improperly. Another interesting characteristic is that despite the huge variety of ingredients some burgers have, the construction and presentation of the burger is actually quite sophisticated.  The kitchen staff does an excellent job with plating and each dish I've had looks gourmet.  And do not forget the Mac & Cheese, you will absolutely not be disappointed.   Now here's the kicker...I've rarely seen anything on the menu that tops $10...and this includes entrees with side.  No joke. High quality food, great drinks, fantastic service...and you can get out of there full and a little tipsy for about $25.  I'm impressed...and you will be too!  Oh! And the only reason I did not give 5 stars was the absence of a dessert menu.  Womp Womp.  Oh well, hopefully they will have one soon!",

They made bacon cheese fries for us which was not on the menu and were quite good. We also orders wings which we prefer hot. They were okay and somewhat sweet which is a personal choice as far as taste goes. So they were not our favorite. Our burgers were quite good, cooked as ordered. The chicken \"twiggies\" (tenders) were a bit over cooked but my daughter didn't seem to mind and enjoyed the fries that came with them, except the parmesan cheese sprinkled over them.

When I walked into the restaurant one thing I noticed immediately was the volume of the music was a bit too loud. It didn't bother me as much since I placed an order to go, but it could be hard to talk over the music. My order comprised of the Danny California with the Wagyu beef patty and the famous sweet potatoes tots.   The good: I loved the sweet potatoes tots! The portion size was more than enough. My favorite part of it was the dash cinnamon on the tots.The Danny California burger was a must for me since it has avocado and I absolutely love avocado!  The OK: I ordered my burger medium-well, but I feel like my burger was a bit well done and a bit dry. The Wagyu patty (extra $5) didn't seem that special to me and lacked seasoning.   Overall, this place is good for getting drinks after work, especially if you are into whiskey. I would consider come back and try other things on the menu.",

Mine was when I read the menu.   And I will never forget about the tots... they were cooked to perfection then topped with a light brown sugar coating. So good. So life-changing. Go!",

They are also incredibly popular, judging by the crowds at just before noon on a weekday.  I've been there twice and have tried both a burger and a dog.  I have to admit that I'm partial to their dogs, since their burgers are just a bit too massive for me.  The Mexicali dog is pretty big as well, but the flavor is dynamite.  It's served in a pretzel roll and topped with pico, avocados, and chipotle aioli.  It definitely satisfied my craving for something different...and spicy!   For sides, I've had both their mac 'n cheese and fries.  I'm definitely a mac 'n cheese snob, and wasn't really fond of theirs.  It was too cheesy without enough pasta.  But I loved their fries.  They were crispy and topped with Parmesan, and I ate almost the entire portion.    Service was quick and efficient.  And I liked that either the manager (or owner?) came over to say thanks for coming and he hoped we enjoyed their food.    I'll definitely be back!",

We ordered a few appetizers (pretzels, twiggy's, and the Sinatra).  Pretzels are great for sharing and they came out hot!  Twiggys we got grilled I wasn't overly impressed, but again, good for sharing.  The Sinatra (breaded mozzarella) was by far the most delicious, but only comes with three pieces so we had to split them... I could've eaten a whole plate by myself.  As for our meal, I ordered the Jimmy's Page... Turkey burger, apples, cheese, pineapple salsa, DELICIOUS.  and the sweet potato tots are heavenly!  I will definitely be back again soon, oh and they have spike milkshakes which sadly I was too full to try!",

    "text": "Watch out, there's a new Brunch spot in town and Cowbell is a sharp shooter.    We moseyed into Cowbell as a last resort on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. We had 13 people and had already been completely turned down by 5Church (snobs!) and then told by Dandelion it would most likely be an hour wait, but they couldn't make any promises.  We were walking by Cowbell and popped our head in just to see if they had any seating and lo and behold, they could sit all 13 of us at once, AND recently started serving brunch.  Also, I think it's important to note that they didn't make us wait until our entire party arrived to actually sit down, which was awesome.  The first thing the waitress told us is that they had been doing brunch for a little less than three weeks and they would appreciate constructive criticism, which I thought was very honorable.  Kudos for welcoming feedback!  The mimosas and Bloody Mary's were poured with a heavy hand - again, a spectacular bonus.  The coffee was on point and they never let our drinks hit the bottom of the glass.    The music (as always) was upbeat and really started the day off right.  Who doesn't want to listen to 90's jams?!  This is AMERICA.  Okay, the food - what you've all been waiting for... The food was extraordinary - which was surprising to me most of all since they have only been serving brunch for THREE WEEKS?!$. Unheard of.  There were lots of options and everything we got was fantastic.  Started with the Apple and Cinnamon Croquettes (for all intense and purposes these are savory donut holes) served with hot maple cinnamon butter to slow dance with your taste buds.  Favorite brunch items of the group were the Breakfast Casserole (a little bit of everything all rolled into one), Lenny's Sleepover (chicken tenders and fluffy waffles), the Benny, and the Sandy.  But I got the casserole and you should definitely just put that in your mouth as fast as possible.  Outrageous.  Overall Cowbell was in the stars for us.  The wait staff was so sweet and accommodating (especially considering that we were already in our NASCAR outfits and deserved to be judged), the atmosphere was upbeat and fun, the food was mouth watering food porn, the drinks were heavy, and service was quick and we had a BLAST!    Overall rating?  HELL YEA!  MERICA!",

I had the NYC burger for $12 which was topped with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese and Kraut. I had high hopes for this combination being a fan of the pastrami sandwiches but was let down when the burger arrived, the pastrami and kraut was barely visible and mostly indistinguishable from the beef on the burger. Kraut has such a distinct flavor but not here, they need to charge a buck more and double the toppings.  The beef was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, when asked about the side options I was directed to the sweet potato tots, I asked are they house made, no frozen....pass, how about the fries are they house cut? No, sorry frozen....pass, I will take the cucumber salad.",

Although, my one gripe is that the Elvis burger misleads you to believe there is peanut butter and bananas on it... but that's just me being silly.  The Elvis is actually the epitome of burgers if you are looking to go classic... beef patty, cheddar, ketchup, mustard, roma tomatoes, onions and a garlic aioli..... my mouth is watering as I type this.  There's a little something for everyone on the menu.  Those a little adventurous with heat... I recommend the Dani California.  Super tasty turkey burger with a great kick.  Not a burger person?  They have salads and chicken sandwich options.  The staff here are friendly and the space is great.  The decorations make it fun and interesting.  I love how you can find something new on the wall every time you go - makes for great conversations.  My last visit they had 80s hair band videos playing... EPIC.",

Very unique and fun.  Typically I go for the veggie burger (get the tots on the side - holy yum), but I went in today to find out that it was brunch aka no veggie burgers. After crying to the bartender a bit, I ordered the veggie scramble. Although it wasn't what I wanted, it was incredible! Just the right amount of spice and protein for a early Sunday.

I was tempted by 3 dishes especially, the buffalo chicken sandwich, \"Vince's Cowbell\", the NYC burger with pastrami and swiss and the fact they will turn any salad into a wrap I was digging the BBQ chicken salad/wrap.   I went NYC burger with no saurkraut and loved it. Have to get sweet potato tots as the side, tremendous. The burger is slightly smaller than the bun but didn't feel bready and was a the perfect size for lunch.   My buddy had the Danny California Turkey burger with avocado and he was seriously impressed. He got the side salad. His wife was on him about diet but this was a pretty solid healthy choice. Service was quick and attentive. Going back here sooner than later for one of the other two choices I was looking at this time but didn't try.",

    "text": "Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 4.25 Stars  Another solid lunch at Cowbell, but this time, the burger was even better! Got the Patty Melt with TWO nice sized patties, lots of carmelized onions and yummy white cheese on a rye bun. Perfectly cooked to medium (my buddy Joe LOVES his burgers next to raw, so he got his \"as rare as you can legally make it\" and they did!). Very juicy, flavorful and FILLING!   Their parmesan fries are really good....as I've learned from my past soiree's here, their Onion Rings are \"hit and miss\" and I didn't want to take the chance, so I went with their always solid fries.  Look this is not the cheapest burger in town....with a coke this rang up to $16 withOUT tip....BUT, I'll pay for a good QUALITY burger anyday....and Cowbell serves up those quality burger.....just don't be shocked when you get the bill. If you want cheap, hit Mickey D's. But in comparison, this is just a TAD bit more than 5 Guys which you've heard me rant as being surprisingly expensive (although really damn good).   This does turn into a cool, \"hipster\" vibe place after 5pm, and they have a great selection of whiskeys....  As my gal pal Nikki (our awesome CM) says, who can not love Rock n' Roll, Burgers and Whiskey?",

They had the music turned up so loud the server had to \"huh\" and \"say that again\" to me like 3 times when I was trying to order which was annoying. The seating is also kind of weird because we had a booth/table against the wall and had to sit next to an arguing couple on the left and an active infant on the right.  For a tasteful  $13 chicken sandwich and fries I'll say the food is pretty good but the whole overall set up is off here.",

The waitress was welcoming and when she came to the table she was nice but she didn't check in on us much. That was one of the reasons for the lowering if one star. I ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese. They were really good. I then ordered the Boogan Bacon burger. That was really good. I ordered it medium but it came out well done. No pink in sight. But I was too hungry to ask for a new one. Hopefully they can work on this. I had onion rings with it and they were ok. The grease didn't seem as fresh so I didn't eat all of it. I would try them again and hope for a better outcome. Don't get me wrong, the were parts to the burger that I enjoyed. I added provolone cheese and the bacon jam on it was so good.",

The burger is hand patted and seasoned which sets this burger apart from a lot of the burger joints uptown. If I had room after lunch I would have doubled down on a banana pudding milkshake   The only draw back to cowbell is its dining room is not the biggest.

It includes one slider (your choice from any burger on the menu, but they make it the size of a large slider) and a side. This is plenty of food for me, but if you're a big eater, you may want to order more.   I've tried the onion rings and the mac and cheese from the sides. Both were ok but not great. The onion rings are really big which is great, but the breading is very heavy.   There is a full bar and there always seemed to be a big lunch crowd. On the weekends, this place turns into a bar/club at night.",

They have a decent selection of local beer and they have a fair amount of bourbon to pick from.  My only recommendation would be to investigate other places for a pour of bourbon.  I wanted to try the Barrell Bourbon, and yes I know that is it not an easy to find bottle.  They wanted $26 for 1.5 ounces... I just wasn't willing to do that so I passed on that. We got burgers and fries or onion rings.  The food was good.. a little better than average bar food.   The music was good but loud.  They played a lot of 80's and 90's rock videos on the tv screens. If you want a burger, it is pretty good, but there are a ton of other places to try in the downtown area.  I don't regret going but probably wouldn't go back.",

However, if you are a whiskey connoisseur, this might be your jam...they have a broad selection, check the menu photo below.  I ordered the Berry mule and salmon tacos with sweet potato tots. The mule was...meh. The fish tacos appeared to be made with canned salmon; however, I am not totally sure. The taco was stuffed with what seemed to be minced salmon but the fresh salsa on top was tasty. Taco...meh. The sweet potato tots were the highlight of my meal....delicious soft bites dusted with cinnamon sugar. I actually recommend them as a dessert instead of a side.   The atmosphere seems like a great place to hangout and watch the game. Lots of televisions around with a great Uptown location and many additional options close by.   Please note, they do not validate parking for the lot located directly next to Cowbell. It will also set you back $21 for about 3 hours...I know that you have NO TIME for such foolery!  I will visit again, have a burger and update my review.",

Eggs had no flavor and wings seemed undercooked. I ordered the Boogan burger, absolutely no flavor. My husband ordered the Elvis and he hated it. He loves burgers and left half on his plate, he  didn't even want to take it home. Both burgers were suggested by the waitress as being the top 3 burgers. We were very disappointed.",

    "text": "We made our first venture into Uptown last night and decided to try the Cowbell Burger &Whiskey Bar. I was sort of stuck between 3 star and 4 stars as I will explain.  First of all, atmosphere-wise it's a neat place. Sort of a combo of a rocker restaurant and a nostalgia joint. But for a dining establishment, the music, while excellent, is just 2 decibels too loud for comfortable eating volume. Just tweak it down a notch please at 5:30. You can turn it back up after 8PM.  We stared with the fresh hot pretzel bites for an appetizer. They were excellent, with two distinct dipping sauces; a honey-mustard that was sweet and a beer-cheese that was savory. Switching back-and-forth between the sauces worked great.  For dinner, I ordered the Bruiser burger, which my server (who was a very nice young man named Kyle I believe) warned me that I better like horseradish (I do!). The Bruiser has a blackened beef patty, onion bun, horseradish cream, Gorgonzola cheese, lettuce, onions & mushrooms. What Kyle should have said was that you better like Gorgonzola cheese (which I do!) because that was the over-riding flavor of the burger. I very much enjoyed the burger.  My son ordered the Umami burger, and he also thought that was very good. But here is where things started to slip.  My wife ordered the fish tacos. In her opinion, the fish wasn't fresh and the tacos were soggy. Even though she only got two small tacos, she only ate one and left the second one untouched.  The House Parmesan fries were just not crispy at all (on any of the plates). They were for lack of a better description, doughy. I almost never leave an uneaten french fry, but I did last night. Secondly, the side order of onion rings was a big disappointment. The rings are not big, they are gigantic, and therein lies the problem. The onions were not allowed to dry out before breading and frying so they were extremely wet on the inside, to the point of being unpleasant. And the breading, while crunchy, is just way over the top. Like I said, visually impressive, but not great to eat.  Lastly I ordered a ginger beer. I received the littlest bottle of ginger beer I have ever sen, 6.5 ounces. When you order a drink from a restaurant, you should at least get 1 cup of drink.  Because of these deficiencies, I pulled my rating down to 3 stars. Good burgers, but the execution of the rest needs some work.",

We were sat at a high-top near the bar area next to another couple. We sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to greet us. Finally a bartender walked over and asked the area if anyone had come over...obviously a no. Apparently there was a miscommunication about who had the section we were sitting in. The bartender got a server over to greet us. We ordered fried pickles that took 30 minutes to get to us. Our food took AT LEAST an hour (there was literally no one in the restaurant). When I got my food there was a nice black hair in it. I sat patiently trying to wait for the server to come over and eventually I had to wave her down. She had the nerve to ask me if I wanted the kitchen to make my food over after I had already been there for 1.5 hours. She wasn't apologetic in the least.",

Great music and music videos playing.  And may I add one thing to this....I am so TIRED of going into restaurants with sports playing on the TVs.  I was so glad for the respite.  Ok onto the food.  There were disco fries on the appetizer menu so of course we had to try them.  Excellent!  They had the requisite cheese and gravy plus some delicious carmelized onions and a little mushroom!  I opted for the\"State\" hot dog which was basically a chili dog.  Fantastic roll, sweetish chili  - very good.  A little light on the slaw for this southern girl but I could have asked for more.  I also had the pan fried corn as my side.  I mention this because they had several sides to choose from and I appreciate this.  Fries get tiresome.  I would completely recommend this place and look forward to my next visit!",

We ordered the sweet potato tots as our side - very good with a dessert-like sweetness to them.  I really enjoyed the 90's rock videos, cool decor, and fun service.

The patties are rather thick, not flat, so the juices retained does make for a messing - fun - interesting meal.    The mac&cheese was out of this world.  Good stuff!  And you can order it instead of fries with a burg.  Also, the onion rings are tasty, served with a spicy sauce.  But, really?  Just three onion rings, errrrrr.....

So we might've had a good thirty years on most of the diners here, but service was friendly and efficient and they put us right at ease. :)  We started with Pretzels. These were no ordinary pretzels; they were small barrels packed with flavor, hard on the outside and soft on the inside. They complemented perfectly with the Guinness cheese sauce, which carried just the right amount of kick. These pretzels were great and something that we will be sure to try again on a return visit.  Dora here. I would've sworn the cheese dip was actually some type of Dijon mustard base. Light and mild to taste, but set my throat on fire. Yum!  For my meal, I chose the Dumpling, an Asian pork burger topped with hoisin glaze, slaw, and sriracha aioli on a Kaiser Roll and a side of Sweet Potato Tots.   This burger definitely had a unique taste with all the various flavors melding together. Makes me want to return soon to try another. If the burger was not great enough, the sweet potato tots took this dish over the top. Outstanding! Now I have never tried sweet potato tots but I can tell you they will be added to my plate whenever they are offered on a menu again.   Dora here. I really enjoyed the Boogan's Bacon Burger. The patty was huge and meaty, and looked handcrafted, and the bacon marmalade and garlic aioli gave it an added pop. And fresh fruit? How could I resist? Check out that heaping bowl of berries and pineapple. Delish!  Looks yummy, right? It was! Even so, my fork kept wandering over to Ernie's plate, and I snatched more than half of those Sweet Potato Tots. Yowza! Those tots sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon rocked! Heaven in my mouth!  We rate this restaurant five forks out of five for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

We had a little wait for our table of 4 so we decided to sit at the bar and order some drinks.  Bartender was great in offering suggestions.  They have a nice selection of Moscow Mules, I've ever seen.  This place has a has the best burger selection it was hard to decide on just one.  We all loved our burgers.  I think next time I will try the tater tots. The fries where good but nothing to jump up and down about.  I'll be back.",

    "text": "I want more Cowbell!  Last time I was in Charlotte, this little burger joint was right around the corner from where I was staying and I debated going in a couple times but never made it. This time (while in route to Ohio) I stopped in Charlotte for lunch and the Cowbell was my destination of choice. Being that it was after the main lunch hours, the restaurant wasn't very busy and I was able to saddle right up to the bar and grab a stool.   After perusing the long list of burgers & getting some beer recommendations from Lindsay behind the bar, I settled on the Bruiser Burger with sweet potato tots for this dining adventure. My blackened beef patty came on the softest onion Kaiser roll with horseradish cream, gorgonzola and caramelized onions. The burger also comes with shitake mushrooms, but I opted to go without. The cooked to medium burger was juicy and overflowing out of the bun. I don't know when it will be, but I'm looking forward to trying more of what they have to offer in the burger dept. The tots were so good, I could have eaten a bucketful. They had the slightest sprinkling of - I'm assuming - cinnamon on them that perked the flavor up a bit without making them too sweet.   I didn't partake in any of the whiskeys offered at the Cowbell, but I'll save that for next time.",

Ordered a medium prepared burger (the Elvis, their staple) and received an overly  well-done burger that tasted like it had been sitting on the grill for some time long before I got there. I could tell that to be so because my food came out like 5 minutes after I ordered it. You know how long a burger takes to cook? At least 10-15 mins, maybe more. Also the bread was not fresh. This type of behavior from a restaurant you should be careful of. I ordered their basic burger for a reason because the more exotic the burger THE EASIER IT IS FOR THEM TO COVER UP OLD PATTIES WITH SAUCES AND OTHER INGREDIENTS. I would not recommend it as good food to eat, or anything close to that. Would give ZERO STARS if I could.",

The walls were an awesome mix of fun \"posters\" and then victorian looking wall paper. The ceilings were made up of cool metal tiles! Service-Friendly and fast! When we were there (1 PM on a Sunday afternoon) it was busy; I am guessing because this is their brunch time. However, this did not inhibit the great service we got!   Food- Flavorful! I ordered the brunch burger which was served on a croissant bun and I could not be more happy about that! The burger was medium rare (as I had specified) and perfection! In addition the egg on top was salted and peppered to perfection! I chose the side of hash brown cakes and was in love! My boyfriend ordered the bacon burger! It was a bacon burger for sure; severed withe bacon strips and bacon jam! I sampled a bite and was blown away! Can you say flavor! YUM! He chose fries as his side and they were delicious!  Price- Reasonable. I felt like the price fit the overall feel of the place and the quality was not compromised! We almost chose an appetizer but they were a little steep ($10 for disco fries!). For us two to dine on some delicious burgers it was under $30! BONUS!",

    "text": "Rock 'n roll, burgers and whiskey. I dig all three of those things.  Cowbell is a product of the same people who brought us Mortimer's and Leroy Fox. This burger joint looks nothing like its predecessor Nix. Hip decor and tremendous 80s/90s music videos greet you when you walk through the door.   The most difficult challenge you may face here is narrowing down your meal choice. On the app side: I recommend the Fried Mozzarella. Make sure you add the pesto and prosciutto for a just a couple bucks more. Yes, I'm in an open relationship with fried pickles, but I've had hit or miss experiences here with them. Sometimes they are just out of this world. Other times, they are way too salty and overcooked. Proceed at your own risk.  My current burger of choice: the Bruiser. It's a blackened beef patty, onion bun, Gorgonzola, roasted mushrooms, lettuce and caramelized onions. Money.  If burgers are not your thing, Cowbell also has a fantastic grilled chicken sandwich called the Winehouse- honey wheat bun, arugula, roasted red pepper, smoked habanero jack and honey mustard.  Now I'm about to get crazy on you with what side item to pick- get a salad with the homemade poppy seed dressing. I know, I'm telling you to get a salad at a burger joint. Trust me... that dressing is beyond amazing. The sweet potato tots are great, too.  Cowbell also has a contraption that makes a giant ice ball for your cocktail... if you're into that kind of thing. It's pretty cool.  Staff is super friendly. The dining area isn't real big. There's usually a wait at peak times... but it's worth it if you have the time. If the tables are all taken... grab a spot at the bar!",

Then we ordered Pretzels (hot & creamy Guinness beer cheese and honey mustard dipping sauce). The Guinness beer cheese sauce was amazing! You might want to order an extra side of that!  For Brunch we both ordered the Frank's Benny (fluffy biscuit, crispy prosciutto, poached egg, grilled tomato, hollandaise, green onions, with a side of grits). We prefer our eggs HARD! I love hollandaise sauce so I ordered an extra side of it. The tomato was grilled to perfection! The eggs were done but not overdone. The meat was beyond flavorful! The grits were thick and full of flavor. The entire meal was full of great flavors! Perfect for brunch! Kaitlyn took really good care of us so be sure to ask to sit in her section! MOST SINCERELY!",

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. 5 stars. We had an appetizer of onion rings. They were very quite good. Large, crispy and served hot. However, two of the rings still had the onion skin still attached.   For a place that advertises itself as a \"Burger bar,\" it was disappointing. I ordered The Bruiser. My burger was cooked medium-well instead of medium-rare (since we were running a little late for a show, I did not ask to have it redone). This burger, despite having a long list of delicious ingredients, was a little on the dry side and neither of the ingredients stood out - they all seemed to blend together. My wife had the Alamo salad. She said was good but noted that the tomatoes were overly ripe and the salad was quite small.  Our chief complaint was the noise. The speakers were blaring music so loud we had a hard time having a conversation at the table.   Where this place shines is in its Scotch Whiskey selection. They offer (I'm guessing) about 130 to 140 different whiskeys. Either available as single serve or in flights.",

    "text": "My objective opinion of Cowbell is 3 stars, but my emotional rating is a 4.   The positives? The staff is incredibly friendly, and everything came out pretty quickly. Granted, we were during the lull after the lunch rush, so it was probably a bit easier to focus on our table, but either way, the service was great! We were visiting the city and had our dog with us, so it's kind of hard to find places that would allow us to eat there, but they were really accommodating and allowed us to sit outdoors without any fuss. Brought our pup water and everything!  The average? The food. My wife and I both ordered the Elvis burger. It was just okay. Nothing remarkable, but it wasn't horrible, either. I just don't think their patty meat is good enough to stand on its own in their basic burger. It's likely better suited as the base of one of their more adventurous burger preparations. We also ordered the deviled eggs. Also ordinary, with at least a bit of texture to add something to the dish. The pickles are solid, though. For sides, we got the fries and their cucumber salad. I loved the cucumber salad. The cucumber slices were huge, but it was a refreshing side on a warm day! Fries were good, but on par with your standard restaurant fries.  The drinks were decent. I ordered a few cocktails. The Immigrant was their Manhattan and was quite delicious! The second cocktail I ordered was the Decker, which was The Immigrant with a \"cherry twist.\" It was too cherry-forward for me, but if you like cherry, it would be a nice option.  Overall, I'd say the friendly staff and their impressive whiskey list is worth stopping in for. Don't go in expecting the best burger you've ever had, but if you're just looking for a reliable meal, Cowbell can certainly deliver that!",

I am on the fence about the deviled eggs as the house garlic pickles were amazing but the crispy prosciutto was scarce. Now the disco fries are a must order. A great combination of caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, cheese, and gravy over fries.  They have an extensive burger menu which will make it difficult to decide. I ordered the PM burger with sweet potato tots and my wife got the fiesta tacos with fries. The tacos were okay but not a place I would consider to have amazing tacos. The burger, on the other hand, lived up to expectations. It was juicy, spicy and cooked to my liking.   If you are looking for a good burger Uptown then Cowbell is the place to go.",

I love the decorations and the vibe of the place. Every time I go, I always tell my boyfriend that I want my house decorated just like this place. It's always busy, so try to go when they open that way you don't have to wait long. You can always sit at the bar and have a great time, but if you like to get a table make sure you get there early. I always get a burger, but they have more options. Yesterday, I had the Boogan bacon burger and it was fantastic. I got it with fries and they sprinkled Parmesan cheese on them. My boyfriend got onion rings with his burger and those were amazing. Next time I need to remember to order these. I feel that yesterday the AC wasn't working because it was really hot in there, but it was the only time I've experience this. Hopefully they fixed it by now",

My wife ordered a New York Sour and they said they knew how to make it.  The first drink came completely wrong then the bartender had to google the drink and then make it,  that wouldn't be so bad but by the time the drink came out everyone was on their Second.     The burgers came out and two of the three were on very stale buns and the corn side was very salty.  When the waitress was called over and told she brought over the manager they offer to give us a free burger.  All we wanted was a new side because we just ate the burger without the bun.  She agreed and then the waitress told us after 15 minutes that the kitchen was too busy.     We told them too forget it and off course 15 minutes later the corn came out.  We then had to wait twenty minutes to get check which then they charged us for a burger and the drink.  What they didn't realize was that we are a group of event planners that were going to book the place for a private party for a convention.",

The restaurant itself is not that big so you are sitting pretty close to your neighbors.  Also it's super loud inside, so not really a good first date kind of place.   I ordered the Lisa Marie chicken sandwich.  The sandwich came with bacon, tomatoes, and avocado.  It was pretty good.  The chicken breast itself was tender and there were not bad parts.  It was kind of on the small side but I didn't care because I chose Pan Fried Corn as my side.  The Pan Fried Corn was delicious.  It was basically corn off the cob fried in butter with some spices and served hot in a big bowl.  It was way too much for me to eat but I sure did try to finish it all.    I would go back just for the Pan Fried Corn.",

I respectfully request a BIGGER table to which she seemed confused and reassigned is to another BABY table! I kid you not she moved us to another table exactly the same size.

I like that they have vegetarian and bun-less options. My friend and I agreed to share what we were going to order and even then it was SO hard to choose which to get!   Here is my overall point of view:  Food: Boogans Bacon Burger - amazing. Although I kept trying to distinguish the bacon marmalade and didn't quite get it. That didn't matter because roasted garlic aioli was a winner! We got the sweet potato tots which were amazing. Crisp, sweet and so so so yummy.    What made the PM Burger so special was the pulled pork. Sometimes you worry adding so many meats and or toppings can take away from the burger but it's what made it. The beer cheese was an amazing compliment. I do love spicy and wish it had more jalapenos. For this burger we got the regular fries which were seasoned and great. Prices are very reasonable.   Service: The service was prompt and friendly, just the way I like it.  Location & esthetics: Great location uptown. Parking is questionable but that's just the uptown area in general unless it has valet (far and few). Cowbell is not a dive but has a smart casual feel and draw.   All in all, I highly recommend.",

Unfortunately, we left slightly disappointed. I love burgers with egg and bacon on it, and I especially like trying ones that have a twist I've never thought of before. I was excited to see the Big Will's Breakfast burger with egg, bacon, red onions, and honey mustard. I ordered it medium with a side of onion rings. The onion rings were good as far as onion rings go, but I only got three. And they aren't the huge onion rings that take up half the plate, so three seemed to be missing a few. As for the burger, it was decent. It wasn't truly medium, but that didn't bother me too much, it was just notable considering this is a burger place. The honey mustard added an interesting zing and sweetness to the burger that oddly matched well with the egg and bacon. However, in the end, my wife and I both left saying \"that was three stars.\"",

My husband and I both ordered the Boogan's Bacon Burger without onions and hands down one of the best burgers I've had! They definitely aren't stingy with the amount of bacon loaded on there and the garlic aioli mixed in gave it so much flavor!  I chose the sweet tots for my side and those little things were like candy! Super addicting, but I had to take mine to-go because I was already so full from my burger. I love how they've mixed together rock n' roll with a bit of rustic glam for their decor!  Pretty unique!  Although I can't remember our server's name, she was a tall brunette and did an excellent job.  Very attentive, stayed on top of refills, and always checked in with us.  She even entertained my 19 month old son for a bit. Would love to try this place out again without the kids and see what their whiskey and beer is like!  Overall great time and would recommend to all!",

The place is super cool, the music is good, there are no better wall hangings in all of Charlotte and the service is great too.  If they get their buns right, then this place will be killer!",

The Dumpling was the right amount of spicy so that it had a kick but was not burning my lips. The cheesecake was the right kind of creamy texture with a strawberry sauce and sort of a funnel cake crust.  We ordered out so I cannot comment on the restaurant service/atmosphere, but I would certainly eat here again.",

On a Thursday night at 6 pm, I don't expect Nine Inch Nails to be BLARING from the speakers...on top of all the tvs being on, etc.  Even if the food was better, the atmosphee would keep me away.  I imagine it's a great place for drinks if youre looking for a bar scene; but I will never go back there for dinner. Sadly, I'm gonna recommend you eat less Cowbell.",

    "text": "So much of a mish-mash of good and not-so-much that I have a hard time deciding!   I'm already over the pretentious new burger joints. I get the whole let's-get-topping-crazy and play with flavors, but there is a lack of authenticity when that idea takes over the comfort portion of your burger.  Had lunch with wife and son. Got there early enough to not have to wait. Got seated quickly and our waitress came by to take our drink order. I always appreciate a quick drink taker! The menu is chock full of wildly topped burger combinations (but no just plain old bacon cheeseburger for the young folks, like my son, so we landed up paying for one of the 8 topping burgers with everything taken off but the cheese and the bacon.) (The bacon BTW was awesome!)   I ordered the NYC (Kraut, Swiss, 1000 island, and pastrami). I like my pastrami sammies different, so ordered it with seeded mustard (they don't have) and cheddar instead of swiss. Seems that changing your cheese is a payable upgrade! Yep, $1 on the bill for a change of cheese! I also ordered the onion rings as m side. The burger was not ample. For $12 (and a buck for cheese) I would have expected a more formidable foe, but flavor-wise it was pretty darned good. Good, flavorful pastrami, and mustard are magic! The onion rings, though, were a patent-damned disaster! They looked phenomenal! Big, inch wide cuts of onion with a thick fried batter. There were only three o the plate but so big it didn't matter! Oh, except for the fact that they had no flavor AT ALL! They didn't taste like onion. They didn't taste like batter. If not for the tasty Cowbell sauce (a spicy aioli) I could have been eating the napkin for the amount of flavor they had. Such a sad waste of a side.   My wife enjoyed her turkey burger but was underwhelmed by the fact that there were 2 pieces of roasted shitake mushroom on the patty. A fair bit less than one would have expected. Otherwise she was pretty happy with her choice. She really enjoyed the cuke salad which is cucumbers, onion and a light vinegar dressing.  Service is where a lot of my issues lie, if you have read any of my posts. Our waitress was a pretty, sweet young woman. She started off fine but then she hit my sore spot about halfway through the meal. I ordered tea with \"lots and lots\" of lemon. On my first refill, there was not a ice cube left this side of the Appalachian mountain range. It was evident as she poured my tea, but was not identified or fixed. I cannot stand when my ICED tea has no ice! Anyone else....Beuhler....Beuhler. It's such an easy fix and yet allowed to just wallow until I have to ask. Also never received any extra lemon's which tweeks my heiny. These are easy service pints which are not being met by WAY to many in the service industry.   Anyhow, overall, not a bad experience, just not a great one. For the price, I would have expected much more. I think, to a degree, they are catering to a crowd that wants to spend 12 skins on a burger just to say they eat there rather than finding a great $7 burger cause it's great. So, no more pricey hipster burger joints for this guy. Have been underwhelmed to often.   I look forward to the day I can write another 5 star review (or a strong 4 star) but until then...Eat well.

I can only give it 2 stars because of the food. I ordered wings in buffalo sauce to start and they were not cooked well enough to my liking. I like wings to have that crunch on the outside and still be juicy. These had soggy/rubbery skin. I ordered a turkey burger after that and there was way too much aioli on the burger and the avocado was black and rotting. I typically do not pick things apart but after a bite I had to. Wouldn't go back for the food.",

    "text": "First time trying this spot out. Parked a few blocks away (it's on a side street with no on-street parking).   The Good: Hamburgers were cooked as ordered (Medium); onion rings and sweet potato tots were tasty. Great dipping sauce for the rings, no dipping sauce for the tots. Great whiskey selection (if you enjoy it). The wife had the Gambler (cheddar, BBQ sauce, roasted tomato), and I had the Jerry Garcia (open-faced on sourdough with mushrooms, gravy, caramelized onions and melted swiss). Both were fine, but nothing too amazing.  \"Bad\": They had a whiskey menu, but no beer menu to select from. The server asked what kind of beer we preferred and when we said \"dark,\" he responded with, \"like an IPA, a pale ale?\" Ummmm....no. The beer he brought was tasty, but the beer selection is somewhat limited. It was a quiet night (the place was maybe a third full), but no one from management stopped by to check on us, and the hostess pretty much ignored us as we left (I don't expect management to stop by, but it is a nice touch when it happens, especially when the place isn't slammed).  The decor is a rock-n-roll vibe with classic rock album covers and song lyrics on the wall, pics of rock musicians and movie stars, etc. The music playing in the restaurant was more modern rock, pop, \"country,\" etc. (Beyonce, Imagine Dragons, Florida-Georgia Line).   The place is trendy and upscale as another reviewer mentioned, but the wife and I both walked out saying, \"meh.\" Not a bad place to grab a burger, but nothing exceptional, in our opinion.",

    "text": "This review is unfair... and I hate writing a review like this.  It is unfair because the food that we ordered was definitely 5 star.  But everything else was so wrong. We were greeted at the door, the girl told us she would be right with us. No problem. She returned with a handful of dirty plates, grabbed menus with her free hand and asked us to follow her.  Ew. I would have preferred to wait two more minutes for her to have dropped the plates off in the back. She disappeared for a while after that. When she returned, we ordered beers. They came promptly but she dropped them without asking us if we had questions or wanted to order. When we finally ordered we chose two appetizers, the Vinny- grilled chicken sliders with spicy sauce and a tangy pepper and the Whistle Stop sliders- a thin beef patty with a fried green tomato, delicious bacon and pimento cheese, and a side of fries to share.  The food took 30 minutes to get to our table. Now let me say it again... the food was incredible!!! But 30 minutes is a long time.  I also absolutely hated the atmosphere which made the 30 minutes feel like an eternity.  It was a Sunday afternoon, and they were blaring the WORST rock music. I'm so open minded when it comes to music, but this was just awful. Waiting and watching, the staff was completely disengaged with the guests. Every employee was congregated at the end of the bar, chit chatting and looking at their phones.  I will be back to try a burger. The quality of the ingredients and the execution of the food is just so good not to give them another try.",

The price point is decent and the crowd on the weekends is lively. They have a good selection of beers and liquor. The sweet potato tots are the best! The mac & cheese is hit or miss. Regardless, this place is my go to anytime I'm craving a good burger and a beer.",

Finally we were ready to be seated and did not wait long for our waitress to greet us. We had drinks to start off, then a sweet potato corn dogs, which looked like little fried fritters. It was delicious btw. We ordered the Boogas bacon burger and the Higher ground chicken burger. I saw on Yelp that the higher ground chicken burger was just like a Chickfila burger so I had to try it for myself. I would have to say that it was pretty darn tasty, but I would love it more if it was a spicy chicken burger. As busy as it was inside the restaurant, our food came out in a timely manner. Our waitress was kind and sweet our entire meal. We could tell she was busy, but she managed to come get our refills and check up on us from time to time. I would definitely try this place again!",

The service was very friendly, and the bartender who took our order seemed to have a good knowledge of the whiskey selection. I've never had the opportunity to try Japanese whiskey before, so I got the business class flight, which is a great deal. We got the GFY burger and the dumpling burger. Both were good, but I don't think you actually get enough of a taste of the foi gras in the GFY burger. The mustard that comes on it, while tasty, sort of overpowers the other flavors. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other menu items.",

His mac&cheese was not too shabby either. I had the Jerry Garcia burger (carmelized onions, cheese, cowbell sauce on an open faced grilled sourdough). The sweet potato tots were slightly sweet and delicious. I highly recommend this place, not a single complaint to be had.",

I am a burger and fries girl to the core and this place was amazing. We started out with the sweet potato croquettes, which were so good. I know they are working on a dessert menu, but these legitimately could be dessert rather than an appetizer.  They were so tasty. For dinner, each of us had different burgers with different sides. There was not a bad option among them. The onion rings were incredible - not too heavy, not too much breading.  The sweet potato tots were great, as was the mac and cheese. Not a bad meal in the bunch.   Overall, this is a restaurant/bar that we will definitely come back to...just the right mix of creativity, fun, and great food.",

The people dining at the bar seemed very happy which is always a good sign. The menu is simple in concept burgers or chicken sandwich we opted for burgers. We ordered the dumpling burger which is a solid 5/5 and the danny California which is a 4/5 just because some bites were bland and some bites were SPICY! Still over all very delicious. The sweet potato tots were good but lacked the crispy crunch I'm used to in a regular tot. Prices on food were fair VERY good prices on beer I don't think I saw a single standard sized craft brew over $5 which is a STEAL where I come from. Our waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. She seemed to be the only waitress on the floor and kept on top of things. the female bartender with short brown hair and tattoos was phenomenal too refilling our waters even though we weren't her table, seating us quickly dropping off our beer etc. Great team work ladies.",

We caught a late-ish dinner in this charming bar/restaurant where the decor is as inviting as one would hope.  Music videos from the 80's and 90's play along with the great array of records on the shelves.  We ordered the sweet potatoes croquettes based on someone's recommendation. I am not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but when Bryan (boyfriend of the year) suggested I try, I gave in.  Um---- where have these been all my life????  Served hot and crispy with honey butter and brown sugar....... They are life changing!!! Then the general manager (who was incredible!) came over and served us complimentary fried mozzarella ..... Which is made from scratch and drizzled with fresh pesto and marinara.  OMG........ Mouthwatering!!!!!  Then Bryan ordered The PM Burger, which was a burger with pulled pork, Guinness beer cheese, and fried jalepenos....... Again, probably the best combination of flavors on a bun I've ever sampled.  Service--- even with a table of 10--- was spot on.  I will happily be making a return visit AND bringing friends!!!!",

We were seated immediately and had a server at our table very quickly after that. We ordered the deviled eggs w/bacon as an appetizer & it was delicious! I ordered the Boogan's Bacon burger for dinner w/sweet potato tots as my side. The tots were amazing, if you like sweet potatoes, I highly recommend trying these! Even though it tasted excellent, I was extremely disappointed at the size of my burger. The onion roll was a generous size but the patty underneath was more the size of a slider than an actual burger. Aside from that one negative we had a very enjoyable dining experience & will definitely go back. There's several other items on their menu that look like must try's! Cowbell has a funky modern decor and although it can be a bit loud inside, it has a really cool atmosphere.",

Go a block down the street to 204 North, Sea Level, or a variety of other restaurants in Uptown and you can find the same glass of Blanton's for $12-$15. Save your money!",

This wasn't. The overall burger was great and the sweet potato tots are seasoned with cinnamon and sugar, just like a sweet potato. If I were to change anything, cook the patty a little longer or hotter. Make it crispier.",

Both burgers are stellar and worth trying out.  The sweet potato tots are some of the best in Charlotte.  For those interested in an appetizer, try the pretzels.  You won't be disappointed!    The ambiance has a hipster vibe with a rock n roll twist.  One TV plays nothing but old music videos, which i love.  They have a nice bar with a respectable beer list.  The waiters and waitresses have been impeccable every single time I've been here.  All in all a solid restaurant that I recommend to anyone asking me for a \"good burger joint\" in the area.",

They offer various local beers on draft and so many creative cocktails. I ended up choosing Sugar Creek ale and Jimmy's Page which consists of a turkey burger, brioche bun, sliced Granny Smith Apple, candied bacon, sharp white cheddar, mixed lettuces, and pineapple sriracha with my side as sweet potato tots. Beer was great!! Tots...delish, a must have! Burger seemed a bit underdone for a turkey burger (although that's how I like it)...and there was only one small piece of bacon, no apple and little to none sriracha. Overall, delicious and very happy that I stopped in!  Love the atmosphere and decor.",

I unfortunately didn't 100% love the turkey burger I chose, but fortunately, plenty of other choices to allow for next time. We also did try the fish tacos, which were very good, especially the pineapple salsa. The sweet tater tots are among some of the best I've tried in Charlotte. I love how they flavored them with honey and cinnamon sugar, so they are a bit sweeter. I'm not a whiskey person, so I can't speak to the whiskey here, but i think it can be a great sell! There is a $2 upcharge if you want to change the stated burger on the menu to a beef/veggie burger, which is something to keep in mind. Prices are reasonable, about $12-$14/burger. Service was good. I would certainly eat here again, and if you want creative burgers with fancy toppings like sriracha grilled prosciutto, apple + bourbon bbq sauce, or praline smoked bacon, this is your spot!",

Everyone I bring here says the same and it's always a conversation starter.   The staff has always been delightful and helpful. They will make recommendations and have never disappointed. I personally love coming here to get any of the burgers on the menu with sweet potato tots. Occasionally, I go for the fries because they are as good if not better than the tots.   I've also come here for drinks at the bar on more than one occasion. They have a few signature drinks that are great but I usually come in for the Moscow Mule. The bartenders are friendly and will carry on a conversation while you sit at the bar.   Probably one of my favorite places in Uptown and I can't wait to eat there again soon",

For appetizers we ordered the pretzels and the Sinatra...both were excellent choices and great for sharing!  For my main course, I ordered the Boogans Bacon.

There was a substantial amount of business types who must have been popping in after work. The location is perfect for the after work crowd. The food is tasty and the drinks are good. I can tell you I would go back to Cowbell for The Red Velvet Revolver dessert any day. If you like desserts, and you like fried red velvet cake (trust me, you do), then you need to try the Red Velvet Revolver. I practically drooled onto my computer writing about it just now. It is like combining fried ice cream, cake pops, and cheesecake all in one; except it is the cake that is fried. It does something magical in your mouth whiny eat it. The burger I had was was also tasty, but after the RVR, I forgot everything else. Get your rear end down to Cowbell,  and enjoy some good food and drink.",

We have ordered takeout on two separate occasions, and both times they have forgotten something from our order. The first time it was buffalo sauce from our Vince's cowbell sandwiches, the second time was today when they forgot a side of cucumber salad. Not a big deal, I realize. But when you walk five blocks to pick up lunch for your office, it's a bit annoying to return and realize something is missing. Both times, Cowbell sent someone to our office with the missing items, but be sure to check your takeout order before leaving the restaurant.",

For an appetizer we had deviled eggs which were wonderful!  I loved the notion of putting a pickle on top (the pickles were the best!) For dinner my husband ordered burger with chili and coleslaw (sorry name slipped our mind) which was very good.   I had the Tomahawk burger (the restaurant donates a $1 to local charities for every order) the burger was named because the Panthers happened to be playing the Redskins this week.  It was very good -  We had deep fried ice cream with \"Happy Birthday\" written on strawberry sauce.  Our server let us know the runner was in a goofy mood and everyone was getting something cute on their plate!  We decided to play a joke with our server to tell the runner we were offended and that was a huge success and we had a big laugh!  It was a delightful experience and we will absolutely be back!   Service was top notch and that is what makes us come back to a restaurant!  Excellent!!!!!",

I will say the menu makes it sound way more inventive than the actually execution of the food, but it was still decent bar food.  I think on our next trip through I'd try somewhere else...not really good enough to draw me back in since I'm not a regular of the city and want to make the most of the time I'm there.  Also, the cocktails were pretty disappointing...again, sounded great, but execution not quite there.  Long story short, no complaints but didn't live up to the marketing.",

    "text": "I ate at Cowbell last Saturday before a performance at Booth Playhouse.  I have to say it surpassed my expectations!  The Good: I ordered The Bruiser-beef patty with gorgonzola, roasted shitake mushroom and a horseradish cream sauce.  It was pretty incredible. I would definitely recommend it.  I also was surprised by how much I enjoyed the cucumber salad as my side. It was heavy on the cumin but I just so happen to be a huge fan.  The appetizers were ordered were also great: fried pickles were a hit and that fried ham and cheese with prosciutto and pesto was out of this world. You seriously have to get that.  The Not So Good: They were out of Basil Hayden, my favorite bourbon, so I tried the Baker's instead. It was very good. They were also out of the peach liqueur in the drink my friend wanted so she got wine instead. Not a deal breaker, just a little frustrating. I tasted my husband's burger, The Elvis, and it was very bland.  The Bruiser was about 50 times better. The fries were also unremarkable.  All in all it was a fun, casual and delicious dinner. I would definitely go back for a casual meal with a small group before hitting the town!",

I wouldn't say they were over cooked; it seems like to be ready so fast and not be the least bit hot, it makes you think they must be sitting it a tray full of burgers in the kitchen. They weren't bad...they weren't good. To add to the disappointment, our buns were stale and we each had s different type of bun. When a place says in their name they're a burger joint, the burgers need to be top notch. They need to be better than I make at home. Ours were not.",

We stopped in cowbell because the hostess actually came out to the street to entice us to come inside. We appreciated her effort and decided to post up at the bar. This was the first of many excellent decisions made that evening.   Our bartender was Garrett, a good dude who knows how to make a proper drink. If you ask him nicely, he'll make your bourbon with a solid sphere ice cube that he fashions right in front of you with this awesome ice-shaping device. If your boss happens to be footing the bill, this place has a great selection of very fine whiskeys and bourbons. Red Breast over a spherical ice cube is a real treat to sip on (and $$$$).   It doesn't stop there, the food is excellent. We had house made mozzarella sticks, grilled wings (ask for them well done), and a variety of their specialty burgers. I even tried a deep-fried bacon wrapped hot dog. I'm a fan of every item I tried, including the sweet potato tater tots--delicious.  The food here is great, the ambience is cool with a good soundtrack and music videos on the few TVs, and the staff is very polite and good company.  Every time I go to Charlotte, we will visit cowbell. If only to give Garrett a hard time at the bar (I was greeted with a \"oh no not this guy\" last time I came in--love it), you should check this place out for awesome burgers and drinks.",

They are perfectly season and have a little bit of Parmesan cheese to make them even more interesting. I got the Big Will's Breakfast Burger without the honey mustard and on a brioche bun. It was fantastic! I always hate when i go to a burger place and they give me some wimpy flat burger, Cowbell is definitely not that place. My burger was perfectly medium and so juicy. With the over easy egg this burger definitely does not disappoint. My friends got the Danny California with a Black bean burger and thought it was delicious. She also had the sweet potato tots which are delicious. They are much sweater than normal sweet potato fries so be warned there. Overall it was a great experience and will definitely come back whenever I am craving a great burger.",

The burger menu was interesting at first, until we realized most of the burgers are basically the same with one or two combinations of house items (like candied bacon, etc) swapped in or our to make \"new\" items. So while the list of burgers appears long, they are all more or less the same. If this one burger is your perfect burger, great, but it just wasn't mine.  My fries were dry and covered with what seemed like grocery store powdered parmesan, which I didn't care for. It was everywhere, and there was no tapping it off. The burger meat was just okay, the mayo on the bottom was so generous it kept blooping all over the plate, and the mushrooms on top were so dry and tough I couldn't chew them--my teeth literally couldn't cut the stems. Yuck.  I also wasn't a fan of the ambiance at large--massive flat screens on maximum brightness blasted flashing music videos to the dated hits that were playing a bit too loud, and that's just a little too much for me to relax and enjoy a meal.",

    "text": "I liked this place!!!  It was a little hard to find but once we got there we realized it was worth the hunt.  I was shocked to walk in on a Friday night at 7pm to a mostly empty restaurant.  Maybe others were still walking in circles trying to find the place but I was expecting it to be packed.  The bar filled up first and by 8:30 or 9 it was definitely \"full\" but you can tell they are still in the \"need to publicize\" phase.  Again, due to the location, you aren't really going to just stumble upon this place...you have to be intentionally seeking them out.    The atmosphere was very fun and as others have described it has somewhat of a \"rock and roll\" theme.  They had a couple big screen tv's showing some throwback music videos!!  It was everything from Smashing Pumpkins to Journey to 311 to Nirvana.  They also had a couple smaller tv's showing a basketball game.  Needless to say, the men were in heaven.    This really could pass for more of a bar than a restaurant and typically I don't seek out bar food but Cowbell really pulls together the combination of a fun atmosphere with a fresh/solid menu.  We started with the pretzels and Guinness cheese dip.  AMAZING!!!!  The pretzels were bite-sized and warm, lightly salted, not too doughy, baked enough for a light toasted exterior and a mouth-watering finish.  They were so good!  Our table had a tough time deciding on an appetizer so I look forward to coming back and trying the fried pickles or sweet potato croquettes!  We all tried a different burger so we got a pretty good sampling of the menu.  Everyone was very pleased.  The veggie burger was the only one that didn't get rave reviews...it was a little bland.  The sides were awesome too...I had the sweet potato tots and these things were phenomenal.  They tasted like little bite sized donuts.  They were lightly coated in cinnamon-sugar and slightly crunchy on the outside.  They were pretty much ridiculous!  They are the kind of snack I am going to crave in the middle of the night and go to Cowbell JUST to pick them up.  They were THAT good.   The regular fries were great too...they had somewhat of a parmesan crusted topping with a few other spices---crispy, long, lean, you get the picture...  The service was good....almost TOO good...meaning, I think our waitress was bored because she hung around our table quite a bit.  Haha...we didn't mind but it is hard to say how the service is/will be because this was a pretty slow night.  The menu is inventive but not over the top.  The food is good quality and the price point is reasonable.  The chef looked like he was 15 so I give him credit.  This is definitely another solid restaurant in Charlotte!!  I'll be back!",

I got the Danny California Burger which was described as spicy....I would describe it more as a mild heat that my grandma could handle with ease, but it tasted great. The staff were all very friendly.   The atmosphere is potentially the most hipster place I have ever been to this far East of Seattle. The music is a mix of 90s Alternative and modern pop/hip-hop. Think Drake followed up with Jimmy Eat World. The most \"Cowboy\" thing in here aside from the whiskey selection (which is pretty decent) is the bull horns hanging on the wall. All the rest is hipster art.  However, the food was good and the staff was nice. That's all I truly care about.",

    "text": "We were craving burgers, and decided to give cowbell a try and reading the nice reviews.  When you walk in, it is a really cool looking place. The decor is nice, but also all over the place.  The service was great, too.  Our waiter, Drake, was extremely attentive and personable. He made good menu suggestions, and was always around to ensure we had what we needed.  For an appetizer, we got the pretzels with the beer cheese.  They were good, but not great.  Mostly because I am partial to a giant pretzel, rather than the nuggets.  The best part of the meal was definitely the burgers, though.  We got the burger with the fried egg on it and the croissant bun.  It was delicious and melts I your mouth. For sides, we had the sweet potato tots and the onion rings, which were phenomenal and complemented the burgers perfectly.  We are looking forward to heading back and trying some more burgers!",

Out of this world, I could've made a meal out of those alone!  We split the pilgrim burger and I can honestly say it was one of he best burgers I've ever had. The candied bourbon bacon was so unique paired with the Brie cheese and apple BBQ sauce. We had the sweet potato tots on the side. I've had sweet potato tots before usually served with maple syrup, these were so fresh and dusted with cinnamon sugar they didn't even need a dipping sauce.  For dessert we had the carmel salted pretzel brownie. Again, simply delicious. Served with ice cream and berries on top. Everything was prepared so well, nothing laid on us or was greasy. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "This afternoon was my first time visiting Cowbell.  First, I loved the ambiance. Nice decor, which was clearly musically influenced, and they played 90s music, along with the music videos, and had TVs with sports. It was also very clean. The service was a bit slow; I'm guessing because they only had one guy waiting & handling the bar & not many workers in the kitchen. I'm guessing that wasn't peak time, so that's why they didn't have more workers. Our waiter did as best as he could. He got our  refills, and he checked on us, too.  Now, I really enjoyed the wings (I had the Sweet Buffalo or whatever the name). They were juicy, and the sauce wasn't typical tasting. I also had the Elvis Burger & fries. The fries were tasty but not the best I've ever had. The burger was okay. I didn't like that the bun was huge, and the patty was very small in comparison. The bun to meat ratio was just off for me. The price wasn't too expensive.  I really didn't know if I should give it four stars or not, but I choose against four stars because the burger, which is supposed to be the crux & namesake of this restaurant, was not superb.",

    "text": "Picked up some carry out on a Saturday night when I wasn't feeling very social and wanted to savagely inhale a burger in the privacy of my own home. My food was waiting for me right in the front when I arrived and I was on my way home in less than a minute.  I had been to Cowbell a bunch of times for drinks but this was my first taste of the food. I ordered Big Will's Breakfast Burger mostly because of the fried egg, and holy shit was it good...I think I blacked out after the first bite. When I came to, there was nothing but crumbs in the box and egg yoke on my face.  I ordered onion rings as my side and they were on par with the burger. They were super crunchy and the spicy honey mustard sauce took them to another level. I guess if I had to gripe about something I could complain that there were only 4 rings, but I definitely still felt plenty full.  I don't know if I've ever paid $14 for a burger before but this was totally worth it. When I win the lottery I'm gonna come back and get the $20 GFY Burger with foie gras.  UPDATE: I didn't win the lottery but I got the GFY burger anyway. GFY probably stands for \"good for you\" but I prefer to think it stands for \"go f*ck yourself.\" Anyway, it was a damn good burger, but not really worth $20.  The amount of foie gras was about as expected. However, the copious amounts of prosciutto (normally a good thing) seemed to overpower the taste. I will say that I really appreciated the delicious apricot marmalade though.  I satisfied my curiosity, but my suspicion was ultimately confirmed that foie gras doesn't really work best on a burger.",

Crumbled black bean patty, spring mix, almonds, blueberries, goat cheese and blueberry vinaigrette wrapped in a spinach tortilla. To be honest, I thought the combination sounded \"weird\" but ordered it anyways to try and be healthy. Boy was I wrong. The black bean burger was super moist and flavorful and all of the different ingredients really worked well together.   Plus it justifies ordering the sweet potato tater tots. They are like mini doughnuts and and sprinkled with brown sugar (or something similar). Oh. My. Gosh. Good.  Atmosphere was a little loud. And while the spiked smores milkshake was awfully delicious, not sure it's worth the $10 price tag. Didn't seem very \"spiked.\"",

I didn't get a chance to get any of the drinks since it wasnt a lazy Friday and I had to go back to work.  The burger was good for a turkey burger. It was thick and most, but want very meaty if that makes sense. The texture seemed like there was more filler than meat.   I'm convinced of all the turkey burgers I had mine is the best lol!! The only downside of my burger was the bacon. I was a little disappointed since it said candied bacon and I was expecting a thicker cut and more sweetness. I barely tasted the bacon.   However the options for burgers are plentiful and I loved the unique combos. The fries were pretty dang good too. My burger came with pineapple Sriracha that I got on the side, which was more tasty on the fries than the burger. I used the Apple bourbon BBQ sauce on my burger instead and it was amazing. I mean there was a while slice of Apple in my sauce.    I will definitely come back here for lunch, dinner, or drinks especially since the drink menu is so large! If you are a beef and pork eater you will probably enjoy more of the offerings.",

I think the aoli sauce is what really made it stand out. The Parmesan fries were good/average. My date had the sweet potato tots which tastes great! Kind of sweet but I liked it like that. I was very full by the end of it. It was a pretty neat environment. Very casual and modern, low light setting. Tables close together. Loud music. It wasn't anything too spectacular but I would come back. The food came out very quickly on a busy Friday night,  so that is a plus. The teamwork of the servers was great. However, I didn't get a refill on my water, but that's okay- I wasn't that thirsty. Haha",

    "text": "I will start off and tell you to skip this place and go to Bang Bang Burger instead!!!!  So I went last week at around 9 pm and I have been here before. Therefore, I had very high expectations. So they are known for their burgers because they are juicy and good from what I experienced the last time I was there.   I don't know if it was the menu changing over that impacted this or the fact that it was later in the night or possible management changes. I try to give people the benefit of doubt.   Nevertheless, the burger was TINY! I order a two patty burger ( writing in the description on the menu) and I was expecting two patties.   I got one patty supposedly rolled up from two. My question to management was how many oz come in one patty.  Standard around 6oz before it is cooked.   So I was expecting like 10oz burger but I got like this tiny burned burger.   In addition, the side I order was freezing cold. Who likes cold Mac and cheese? Not me.   Granted the manager was nice to try to resolved the issues but it was just overall terrible experience and not okay . Never again honestly !!!   Skip it and go to Bang Bang Burger. Trust me.",

The mac & cheese was alright, but I couldn't taste the love.  The place was packed when I arrived, but I found a spot at the bar. Service was OK; the bartenders use the terms \"hon\" and \"love\" a little too freely for my taste. I mean, it's not Hooters. There must have been a reunion or after party coming up; all kinds of industry folks at the bar. I had to move down to make room for them.  The whiskey selection was decent, although not as good as last summer and still overpriced. Understood that it will always be a little different.",

It was a bit cold outside, so it was a bit annoying to me whenever someone else came in. Still, there was a good amount of TV screens to watch the games going on for the weekend. The waitress started us off with our drink order. I got a traditional mule and the fiance tried out a local beer.   For our meal, we both got burgers. I got the \"The Melt\" burger that was made on sourdough bread and had cheddar cheese and grilled onions. It was alright for me. I felt like it was something I could make myself. I also got the house fries which was seasoned well with parmesan and herbs. The fiance got the Boogan's Bacon burger with some sweet potato tots. He liked how it was put together and that it wasn't sloppy, but the taste did not wow him. He did enjoy tater tots and liked how brown sugar was sprinkled on them to bring out more sweetness.  Service was great. Our waitress did a great job keeping up with our order and my preference of having mayo on the side for my french fries (yes, I'm a weirdo).  I think the food just did not wow us... Maybe another try when we make it back in town.",

Not like anyone was rude, they just weren't present.    The place was active within 20 minutes of us arriving, but not even close to swamped at any point.  When we walked in the door, two staff members said they would be right with us, but there were THREE more parties that showed up and were waiting in line behind us before someone finally came to seat us.  A fourth party came to the door, saw the situation, and moved on.  That's lost revenue, folks.    There were at least three female waitresses and a male supervisor on the floor (plus bar staff), but we NEVER got our waitress to actually come take our order.  We had to flag down the hostess and insist that she take our food order (as she really didn't want to take more than our drink order and was sure our waitress would be with us shortly, for real this time).  We were checked on by our waitress _after_ our food came and we had sent the hostess back to get ketchup, but we didn't our see our server again until we had flagged someone ELSE down and asked for our bill.  We specifically told our server we wanted it all together, but somehow she came out and started trying to hand people their individual orders.  It would have been comical had we not said multiple times that we were in a rush and didn't want to spend an hour doing lunch at 3pm which is what we ended up doing.  I do have to say that the food was great.  One person in our party considered their burger to be a bit too small (they are on the small side, but a serving of meat is 3 oz, so I'm not opposed to keeping it in that range).  As served, they do look petit, but they are thick and juicy which isn't a bad trade off.  The sides were great, the beers arrived full (when they finally did come), and the burgers were cooked as ordered--including my cheese substitution.  My personal complaint would have been that when burgers are topped with mushroom and onion, I expect more than four pieces of each of those toppings.  Seeing it be skimpy upon arrival, I planned, but the toppings felt a little light despite the generous serving of gravy.  Would I go back?  I'm actually pretty undecided.  I'm not a burger girl so I loved that the menu was diverse and long, and the atmosphere would have been great if there were any staff supporting us, but I'm not a burger girl so any place that doesn't wow me isn't going to get my vote.  I still prefer the burgers at Ri Ra's Rooftop Patio...",

The place was hopping but we were seated right away.  At first glance the menu is overwhelming...in a GOOD way. Seriously, you could probably order something new everyday for a month and still not try it all. I settled for a turkey burger, bun-less, with pineapple chutney, sharp cheddar, granny smith, and I think there was bacon on it (I think the name of it was Jimmy's Page, but I'd have to see it again). My boyfriend ordered the Jaws salmon burger, and we both had the cucumber salad for a side. His only comment was that his was too spicy. Mine however was perfect. Great flavors and a unique combo....exactly what I want at a burger spot.  The inside was very trendy. Personally, the music was too loud for me (made conversation tough...), but they play music videos of the songs in the background which was cool. Food is incredible, but atmosphere could use a little toning down.   Our server was excellent, though I'm sorry I've forgotten her name! Looking forward to going back to try something else in the future!",

    "text": "Had Cowbell today after hearing good things about it through coworkers and on Yelp.  We were a group of four with no reservations and were accommodated within 15 minutes of arrival, around 7:45pm on a weekday.  They have a vast menu full of burgers and tacos, along with a nice selection of appetizers, salads, spiked milkshakes, and desserts.  Service was quick and everyone was friendly, especially the hostess!  Sweet tea!  Oh how long it's been since I've had legitimate Southern sweet tea.  So good.  For starts, our table got the fried pickles and the \"Sinatra\".  The fried pickles came with ranch sauce and were delicious, though I feel like the pickles were a bit too thin.  The batter was good - not too thick and very crispy.  The \"Sinatra\" was a plate of glorified mozzarella sticks that were shaped like chicken fingers and graced with plenty of prosciutto and some red sauce.  These were nowhere close to frozen mozz sticks - they got a collective \"mmnm\" from the table.  I'm not a massive fan of cheese sticks, so I'll take their word for it.   I chose to have the PM Burger medium, which came with pulled pork, fried jalapenos, onions, and beer cheese.  It's definitely a messy burger that I basically ate with a fork and knife and skipped the bun, which I wasn't too much of a fan of.  The beef patty was not as seasoned as I'd like, but the burger as a whole was decent.  It had some flavor from the pulled pork and the beer cheese, but the kick was just not enough for me.  I would have liked more jalapenos.  The sweet potato tater tots were the star of the show tonight - a little sweet from the potato and from what seemed like a sweet cinnamon dust on the outside.  The outer was crispy and the inside was the perfect texture.  I hate when tater tots aren't soft inside and this was not the case.  I would definitely recommend getting the sweet potato tots.  Decent spot for burgers in the Uptown area with a nice casual ambiance and good service.",

I got the turkey burger (I can't remember the name of it) and fries and each of my girlfriends got something different. The only thing one of the complained about was the macaroni and cheese but other than that everyone was satisfied. In particular one friend had the cucumber salad and it was very delicious. The dressing in which they use is what makes the salad so good. The only thing I'd add is a gluten free bun. But otherwise it was all very good.",

Our bartender Lindsey was very lively and attentive. She sang at times and managed to chat it up with everyone while keeping the drinks flowing, food moving, and everyone happy. She spoke to everyone who came in the door and was simply really good at her job. I had a Peach something drink and stopped after that, as I had a slight buzz and this was my first stop for the evening. Their drinks are a little pricey at $12 average, but I suppose worth it. I'll be returning to taste more of their food menu. Cowbell is a gem hidden in plain sight.",

When you walk in during lunch time, this place is always buzzing. It's busy, and fun and there are music videos playing on the large screens to make you feel nostalgic. The staff have always been attentive and pleasant and I loved this place.   This is another one of those situations though, where I really wanted to try something different, but I just couldn't. I was IN LOVE with their black bean burger!!! I have tried many a black bean burger and this one was by far my favorite concoction. The texture is amazing and the feta cheese is a nice touch. Pair that up with their sweet potato tots that are lightly dusted with a cinnamon sugary flavoring.. OMG.. it's like heaven in my mouth.   I am not kidding when I say that I want to hop in my car and take the 8 hour drive just to go an eat one of those black bean burgers with tots... if you go there please eat one for me, so I can at least live vicariously through you doing so.

    "text": "The fella and I visited Cowbell with some friends on a Saturday evening before a Checkers game. None of us had ever been, but what can go wrong with burgers and bourbon?  We got there before the other couple and grabbed seats at the end of the bar. The atmosphere was fun, and it looked totally different than when it was Nix. There were two staff standing there chatting, but apparently they weren't working the bar? They just sort of stared at us while the bartender helped other people, and after a few awkward looks, one of them finally helped us. Weird. The fella got a bourbon, and I got a gin & tonic. It wasn't my favorite, but I couldn't put my finger on why.  After the other couple arrived, we snagged a table by the window (perfect for people watching) and got to it. They ordered some fried pickles, and even though I saw some reviews that said they could be hit or miss, they were definitely a hit for us. For dinner, I got the Winehouse chicken sandwich (YUM) and a side of sweet potato tots. I was surprised by the tots - they were more like bullets, and they were coated in sugar, making them much sweeter than others... almost like a delicious dessert. The fella got a bourbon flight, which he loved, and he got the breakfast burger with fries for dinner. He said the burger was great, but almost too high quality because the texture wasn't as hearty as he normally likes. I know, first world problems.  Once we got to the table, our service was spectacular, and our waitress was incredibly nice and patient with splitting checks, substituting things for other things, etc. I'd definitely go back for more Cowbell!",

It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either, just kind of weird and loud. I definitely would not choose this type of place to come and drink whiskey though.   For food we got the Boogans Bacon burger. It's one of those beef balls that isn't flattened out into a pattie, not my preferred style but still very tasty. The bacon was pretty sparse and limp for a signature 'bacon burger.' The tater tots were pretty good although my wife thought they were too sweet. Had fried pickles to start which were also good.",

Meat overload but in a good southern way - Fried pickles: I'm an aficionado and these were one of the best. Significant textured crispy breading of thin pickle chips. - Whiskey flight: you choose from huge list of options. Beware: I was expecting small taster glasses but there are 3 very full shot glasses which is a bit much for one person :-o - Banana pudding milkshake: nice fresh banana flavor the hub loved with booze to boot - Ham and cheese: fried flat puck of fried mozzarella with prosciutto on top. Right up the hub's alley. - Sweet potato tots: sweet and tender inside yet crispy outside - Tall tea cocktail: not too sweet and refreshing - Waitress: helped pick the whiskeys for me since I'm a novice and gave comments on dishes we were considering - Atmosphere: nice decor inside with large bright music-related art to make it pretty upscale but with 80s and 90s music videos playing on the wall - Hours: open late (close when bars do at 2am) for night owl bites  Midlights: - Mac and cheese: fine cheese flavor but didn't care for the thick noodles   Lowlights: - A little hard to find but look for the signs. My phone maps told me it was on 6th but it was off of 5th   Loved this place's character and the food to back it up.",

They have a decent selection of beer, and very unique styles of burgers.  Beware of the burgers that come with egg on top because they cook it sunny side up, and my coworker and I had some stomach issues the night & day after.  I would suggest to get the egg over medium just to be safe.  Other than that issue everything else was great.  The wait staff are very kind, and attentive even in busy times.  The music is great with 60s-90s rock music.  I will prob",

The two of us split the turkey burger with an order of sweet potato tots and a side of wings. Both the burger and wings were SUPER spicy (which I love) and the tots were surprisingly sweet. If you want more of a savory side, add ketchup to the tots. Otherwise, they're delightfully cinnamon-y and make for a good dessert with your burger.   The food did seem to take longer than expected, but at 9:30 at night hardly anyone was eating. It probably took the kitchen a few to get ready to start cooking again- who knows. Otherwise, pretty solid.",

The tots, had a slight hint of cinnamon, and were exactly as expected, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The beer complemented my meal very well, a pale ale I believe, smooth with slight hoppy taste.  Service didn't disappoint, our waiter was very pleasant and helpful.",

We found this place while searching for somewhere to eat before the Hornets game and we were so glad we found it. An easy walk from our hotel (about 20 blocks away) and easy to find.   The service was exceptional and the food was even better! We started with fried pickle chips for the appetizer and they were amazing, then my fiance selected The Melt for the burger he wanted....he described it as the best burger he has ever put in his mouth. That's saying something folks. We both got sides of Mac and cheese and it was the most interesting Mac and cheese I have ever ate. There was the traditional cheese flavor but there were also flavored of garlic and Parmesan which made it even better. After dinner I was almost tempted to get The Velvet which was fried ice cream served with red velvet cake and chocolate syrup (or something...I was distracted by the fact that there was fried ice cream and red velvet cake together). Fortunately for our bodies we didn't get that but next time I will need to not get food and just get dessert.   This place is definitely one you should check out and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere, crazy music videos, and the fantastic food!!!",

    "text": "*Burger Review*    I have to start with that just so that you know that if you have \"Burger\" in your name, you better come correct!  I'm tough on Burger joints, if you didn't know.  Luckily, Cowbell brings the heat!!  They do an excellent job of combining atmosphere, beer, whiskey, and food.  It has it all!  Let's start with the burger:  10/10 - With an extensive variety of options to choose from, you would be worried that they didn't take the time to perfect any one of them.  So far, I have had two of them.  Boogan's Bacon and the Gambler.  Boogan's is everything bacon and mmmmm mmmmmm, it was good.  Onion Kaiser did the trick.  The Gambler gave exactly what I wanted.  bbq sauce and more bbq sauce.  Awesome!  Drinks:  9/10 - They have numerous local beers on tap and they is usually some kind of special on something running.  I have gone with the Business Class whiskey flight the last two times.  They have three different levels of whiskey flights.  Business Class, First Class, and some other class that I can't afford.  Best parts of the flight..  The GM came by to check on us and informed us that he created the carrying case for the flights.  Just thought I would add that in because it is a cool unique little tid bit.  And, the bartender knew all about the whiskeys and made strong suggestions as to where I should start so that I didnt wash out the flavors of the other whiskeys.  Thought that was kind and informative.   The sweet potato tots:  10/10 - Yeah, they get there own frickin category.  Have you every eaten a french fry mixed with the deliciousness of a krispy kreme doughnut.  Yeah, that is what these taste like.  The perfect mix of salty and sweet.  Oh man.... They are so good.  If anything, just go here for these tots.  Trust me on that!  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

The place was fairly busy with the work week lunch crowd rushing within their 60 allotted minutes.  Atmosphere - Hodgepodge of 70's memorabilia, dark color accents, close/ crowded, decent noise level, a busy ambience of bankers rushing for lunch  Service - Friendly, quick, attentive  Food - It was okay.  I got the Elvis and a side of Sweet Potato Tots.  The burger arrived promptly after ordering, but it was just okay.  It was cooked to the level of \"done\" that I like; however, nothing about it stood out to me.  It was juicy...yes...but again...just okay.  Maybe it was the size of the burger  (which seemed on the small side) or the bun...whatever it was that day...my choice felt underwhelming.  The tots I ordered came with sugar sprinkled on top.  Others may like this added to their sweet potato tots...I unfortunately do not.  Overall - My experience here was just okay.  I will definitely give them another try in the future as the customer service was executed well and the restaurant has a fun and energetic vibe.    On this day, Cowbell just didn't ring my bell.",

Very tasty though.   Appetizer was the fried mozzarella with prosciutto, basil & marinara - unreal. This is very good, INCREDIBLE in fact. Get it! I command you! :-) You will die happy.   Husband got the PM Burger- cooked perfectly. Topped with pulled pork, fried jalapenos and beer cheese. Incredible also. I tasted it... A few times.   I got the Jet burger - black bean, quinoa, etc. not too great, not too bad either. Forgettable. Kind of dusty tasting, however the burger would have been great with some sort of acid - slaw, pickles, even some sort of aioli with vinegar or something! Needs a little more balance of flavor.   All in all, I would DEFINITELY go back!! Next time if I'm back in town, I'll get the fried mozzarella, a whiskey drink and a real beef burger and I know I'll be able to die happy!",
