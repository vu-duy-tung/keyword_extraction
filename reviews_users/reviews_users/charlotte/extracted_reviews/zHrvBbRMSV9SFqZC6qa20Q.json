It's practically a club at dinner time, with a DJ and lights strobing.  This is not a place for a romantic evening or a family meal. You definitely come here for the ambiance.   My asian chicken salad was okay, but I've honestly made a better one at home.  Sadly, it also may or may not have made me sick? I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.   The owner was fabulous, in her Chanel dress, feather boa, and cowboy hat.  We were celebrating a bachelorette weekend, and she grabbed the bride-to-be out of the booth and danced her around the restaurant.  We also had sake bombs and lots of drinks.  Service was good and kept the beverages flowing.  Most girls had sushi that I think they enjoyed.   Overall, food was okay, experience was a total blast and just perfect for our first night on our bachelorette weekend!",

I find the prices are a bit high, but really the atmosphere is what keeps you coming back. There is a Dj on the weekends and celebrating a birthday or anniversary is always welcome. Sometimes there is a birthday surprise that will be delivered to your table. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar, the chefs will custom make you rolls and give you tips on what to try!",

    "text": "By my check-ins you guys should now know my love for sushi.... That being said, eh.  I went to Nikko because it is walking distance and I am currently unable to drive. Lets just say I'll stick to ordering delivery or getting an uber to drive me to my favorites for now.  The sushi was nothing to write home about. My main takeaway was that the sushi was small and was mostly rice. We ordered the Rainbow, spicy tuna, godzilla, and then the cowboy roll. The gozilla and cowboy roll were recommend by our waitress after asking us what flavors we like (spicy is my jam ;)  ). The gozilla roll was on point, good recommendation. I was excited for the Cowboy roll, I thought it would be like the surf and turf roll at cowfish, unfortunately it was not. My friend took one bite and decided it was awful. I just didn't think the flavors mixed well together. Of course my friend was talked into one more piece, where we both decided that it is much better cold and to not dip it in soy sauce. I finished the rest of it like a champ because momma didn't  raise a quitter. (That is a total lie, mom would definitely say I should stop eating when I'm full)  Our bill was slightly over $100 without tip at that point,  we did have a couple drinks with dinner as well. Ijust wasn't impressed.  Really the stars are for the staff and the ambience. Are waitress was lovely, I have zero complaints besides the recommendation of the cowboy roll. Also the place is pretty neat looking with cozy booths, and large circular tables for big parties.  Good luck fellow Yelpers!",

I've been to Nikko several times due to friend's celebrations, etc.  The food is pretty mediocre and bland for certain dishes.  My biggest complaint during my last randevu would have to be the THICK sashimi slices.  Mind you, I have a LOVE for sashimi but it has to be cut in edible portions for you to devour and enjoy, piece by piece.  The thick slices made the meal less appetizing and I had to cut all of the sashimi down to pieces.  The sashimi gave me an upset stomach, it's either that or the multiple incorrect drink orders that were place in front of me (Parton instead of Tito's).  The pros for this place include the friendly owner and the manager Anthony.  All in all, I know I have to revisit this establishment again in the future and want to provide this constructive feedback so Nikko can fix the cuts of the sashimi.",

Starting with the unwelcoming receptionist and the fact that individuals that put their name down AFTER us received seating before we did. Moving on to the table where the most disengaged waitress came to offer her piss poor service. She would circulate the area and tend to every table except ours. There was an issue with my order and this lady had the nerve to point and rudely respond \"this is what you ordered!\" After speaking with her and demanding the manager, he came over just as disengaged as she had. He offered no solution to the rude service. I was completely turned off by the service and subpar food and have no intention of ever returning.",

There's loud music, a lot of people and it doesn't all fit, yet somehow it does. And that makes it special. The food on every other visit has been extremely pleasing, from comforting miso to the most delectable Akami bluefin that I've had in this city. While my meal tonight would definitely qualify as satisfying I was extremely disappointed in two particular aspects. First the beef tataki was rushed, so much so that the potent charcoal flavors were just as prevelant as the green onions served as a garnish, secondly that the cut of the beef was extremely fatty and since it was rushed there were large pockets of uncooked fat, and third that since my only table utensil was chopsticks that the steak wasn't sliced all the way through, it makes it difficult to eat. The other major issue I had, and this one is MAJOR is the bluefin, while I prefer akami cuts personally I'm not going to throw away a good cut of toro, however the bluefin I was served tonight was so torn and butchered that I had to place a table napkin over it so that I could eat the maguro beside it. When I finally got up the nerve to try it the brineness of the cuts was almost as bad as the unfortunate bad albacore that rates as my worst sushi experience ever. It's not going to stop me from going back to Nikko, but in the future I won't have the bluefin unless it's akami at all.",

The cucumber roll is heavenly due to the presence of shiso and the spicy tuna blend here  is the best I've ever had from any sushi restaurant.  While the sushi is good, the kitchen items are subpar for the price. You can get much better Japanese dishes at other restaurants for less. Out of the dishes I've tried, I've only like the bulgogi which I'm not sure is on the menu anymore.

Our server took forever to get us our drinks and when we asked where they were, she yelled at another server to get them. She took about 30 minutes to even take our order. My friend then tried to order another round of drinks and our server literally walked away in the middle of my friend talking to her. She comes back with the wrong drinks and had an attitude when we asked for the right ones. An hour and a half of us being there had passed and we STILL did not have our food. It was 10pm at this point and we were starving. We asked the manager where our food was and she found me and one of my friend's dishes just sitting on a tray that no one had bothered to bring over to us. My other friend did not have her meal and we asked for the manager to go check on it. She comes back and asks my friend if she's sure that she even placed the order. Um obviously she placed it?! Clearly the server just never put in the order. So the kitchen quickly made it for her.  My friend asked the server if we could have some sort of compensation for everything that had happened. The server asked and another manager came up and said \"I don't know what happened but we'll do the best we can to compensate\". He was so unapologetic and clearly did not seem to care that we were unhappy. Our server knew we had complained and she came over and said \"I'm sorry I can't make you guys happy, I am going to transfer your table to another server\". Why even bother to transfer our table this late in the meal? We receive our checks and they gave each of us 10% off.... it took a whopping $4 off of my meal. They shouldn't have even done anything honestly.  Oh and to top it all off, my sushi made me feel sick after I left. Needless to say, I will never return to this joke of an establishment ever again.",

He told me ANY roll could be made as a cucumber roll. So, loving Rainbow rolls, I ordered that WITH CUCUMBER not RICE. He said ok, no problem. Next, I guess who was the manager, older woman, came out and tried to push the cucumber roll on the menu on me. I told her I wanted the Rainbow roll with cucumber, just as the server told me I could get. I wanted that specific combination of fish. So, she went back to the kitchen, came back out a couple minutes later and said that would be 17 dollars, as opposed to the 11 dollars for a normal Rainbow roll. Long story short, I got the standard, subpar, cucumber roll. Won't be back.",

    "text": "I would have ended this review with at least 4 stars, however the level of service I received in addition to a surprised request by the host from the restaurant via a phone call, I am appalled. So I selected Nikko restaurant to celebrate my birthday 12/01 with eight of my friends. Mind you this was my first time here and my selection was based on other reviews. Music was good however two of my guest had to wait an hour and half before they received their meal. One of my guest waited just for soup and couldn't enjoy eating with everyone. Needless to say my other guest did not eat at all. Food was given away to other guests. However, every time the waitress would return to check on us she failed to update any of my guest of the status on their food and would say 'it is still going'. I had to ask repeatedly about it. So at this point I am second guessing choosing Nikko for my birthday!! Not only that 30 minutes later, after I have left the restaurant miles away, I received a phone call from the host stating my guest took the merchant copies of our receipts and wanting me and my guest to either to send a text message of the receipt or drive out of our way to return the copy. Assuming we are near and still together. Assumptions I do not take lightly. Very unprofessional and making me work. So as they assume the merchant receipt were taken no one had them only the duplicate copy. I advised the guy repeatedly to check the metal tin the receipts are presented in via phone. I was not nor was I informing my guess to part take in this request. After the second call I did not receive another call because why? They had the receipts. I have never had a restaurant to ever do that before and to assume and pin point my table to not pay attention and request that all my party return to the restaurant out of our way, disturbed my evening on my birthday. I would not recommend coming back. It's sad it happened on my birthday. I will fore warn anyone who is interested in coming regarding service!!!",

Didn't mess up our orders or checks. The sushi was great. Huge (overwhelming) menu with a large variety of food for everyone- even the non-sushi lovers. Although the sushi was great and good quality, the sizes of the rolls were small and expensive. Wouldn't giving this place a try again some other time.",

We didn't have a reservation or anything (don't know if they take them for lunch) but we were sat immediately, and our waitron was out within a minute or two. The service was great throughout. Always quick drink refills, knowledgeable answers to questions, and generally joking and friendly.   I am certainly do not claim to be a sushi connoisseur, but I really enjoyed the couple of rolls I ordered. I went kind of vanilla on one, just getting a bagel roll, but what blew me away was the Volcano Roll. To quote the menu, \"A shrimp tempura roll topped with Dynamite mix (scallops, crab, & octopus) topped with a baked spicy aioli sauce\". Yum. A great amount of spice but every single flavor still came out. Some may call it complex, I just say delicious.   Nikko is also in a very good location for South Enders to walk to, and apparently things can get bumping in the evenings after the dinner crowd is winding down. I hear the lights go down and they start pumping club music and distributing Sake Bombs. Had to save those for another day though...",

That's not a specialty roll. Overall she was very accommodating, and a great service provider. The fish had a horrible stringy texture, and had no flavor what so ever. The restaurant is beautiful, must have cost a lot of money to remodel.  That's easy for them, because the sushi is so expensive. I did not want to complain, because I would interrupted the staff on their phones. The only reason this got more then 1 star is because of the timely service, and nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "This review is from over the holidays. I was there to meet a group but had arrived early so I went to the bar to wait and have a drink. It took forever to get either bartenders' attention. They were busy but after watching them go back and forth; not stopping to greet or acknowledge me sitting there, I finally just got her attention. That was a little off putting, I know it was a busy night.  The atmosphere is definitely club meets sushi restaurant. They had a DJ that started about 830 or so. Know that it will be loud if you come here on a weekend.  Fine with our group as we had booked our dinner with the intention of a place to have a little fun. We were seated in one of the back rooms which was nice to put a little distance from the music so we chat and catch up. Dinner was fantastic.  Obviously there is a full sushi menu and other dishes. The Korean beef ribs were really good. I also had the black cod and it was well flavored and a good size portion. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dinner selections. Our server was great and kept up with the constant flow of drinks and champagne bottles being ordered. The owner made it a point to come to our table. She even sat with us for a bit and chatted. She walks around a lot talking to almost every table and chatting with regulars. She really seems like she wants to make sure everyone that comes to her restaurant has a good time, good food and good drinks.  We made our way back to the bar for after dinner drinks. I had a lychee martini-it was really good and strong. I am giving 4 stars because I think you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression, and my initial experience at the bar wasn't the best. Overall a great night out and I definitely recommend it especially if you want to enjoy great food in a club like atmosphere. And I have always heard good things about Nikko's.",

I thought we were out to have a fun evening with good food and friends (two of whom are police officers) for my son's birthday, December 1, 2018. Instead, it turned out to be a disaster with my credit card being run 5 times tying up almost $1,200 for four days and causing my card to be cancelled due to potential fraudulent activity. Two of the charges were fully processed, so almost $500 is still tied up. And I've logged more than three hours on the phone trying to resolve and get my funds returned. One manager pretended as though he would help and rectify the situation fully by not charging me at all due to the financial inconvenience, the time spent on the phone with them and my bank (and now the police), but did not. The other actually yelled at me and hung up on me a clear indication that something is not right. I will never go there again, and will advise all in my social and professional circles not to either.

    "text": "I came here tonight with my friend to celebrate her birthday. She made a reservation for 6 pm, and we arrived a few minutes prior waiting for the rest of our group. Majority showed up and we were seated about 6 pm, still missing two more folks who were almost there. At 6:05 pm (I literally was checking the time at this incident), our server (short, thin, older Asian woman with short hair) came over and asked if we were waiting on more people. We said we had two more people who should arrive shortly, and she abruptly asked how long it would. \"How many minutes?\" We said probably about 5-10 minutes, and we would like to wait on them before we ordered. Her response, \"I need to put the order in soon because it is a busy night.\" At this point, there were only five tables with people, and most of the servers were standing around waiting for customers to come. We asked her to give us a few minutes and then looked at each other astonished. We literally just sat down, and it felt like we were being rushed out. Ten minutes later, the rest of our party arrived, and the server immediately comes over to take our order. She also stood at the table waiting for the other two guests to order even though they had not even had a chance to look at the menu yet. Very rude! The other guests spent about 5-10 minutes trying to decide while she stood there waiting.   When our main dishes were brought out, it was all brought one by one with a couple of minutes in between each. Typically, they should be brought out altogether, possibly one or two closely behind the rest.  We had a group of six and was charged gratuity tip. I'm not sure if that is the restaurant's policy to add that on groups of six or more, but just something to be aware of. One of the guests and I paid our bill in cash, and the server took it up without coming back with our change. I had to ask for my change, but I was still shorted a quarter. With horrible service and gratuity tip already added, I was not going to tip any extra.  The server tried to clean the table while we were still sitting there, and she constantly circled our table waiting for us to leave. A couple of times, she took up our dishes even when we said we were still working on them. Again, what is with the rush?   Food was okay. A bit expensive for what it is. The desserts are delicious though. While I noticed a couple of great servers working hard around the restaurant and providing good customer service to their tables, service at this restaurant overall is horrible.",

I remember when the restaurant was small and quaint, located in Uptown. Service was so much better then. Once it grew, service began to fall. I've made reservations that were not honored. Saturdays... the music is entirely too loud to enjoy each other at the table. Waiting time has been horrific. It seems, on the weekends, operationally.. there needs to be some tweeking to make sure the patrons have an excellent experience. I've said all of this to say...go on a WEEKDAY! You will have your server's undivided attention. Food will arrive in an expedited fashion. There are parking spaces available. The music is at the right volume. You're not waiting 20 mins for valet.

Their downfall is the service. The restaurant starts to get a club vibe after 8 pm on a Saturday and that's all fine and good -- some restaurants are very successful with a club/restaurant scene. But Nikko simply isn't good at it. The servers are far too flustered and backed up and distracted. Three out of 17 of our guests NEVER received their food. None of it. Not even an update. Those three guests left the restaurant to eat at a fast food chain down the street, instead. And again, this was for someone's birthday! The owner should focus more on great customer service, and spend less time dancing with drunk patrons. It was a horrible experience and put a really bad taste in my mouth. I won't be back for a celebration of any sort.",

I also tried the dinner with chicken that I got with miso soup, salad, chicken and fried rice.  A lot of food which I didn't finish but decent sampler. Rice was good.  Chicken had nice sauce but a bit dry. Good dish if u are hungry! It was very loud for being Saturday night so I imagine good for parties not necessarily weary travellers getting off a 5 hour flight. If I'm back here I would probably go back and just try more sushi.",

    "text": "Be prepared for 30 plus minute wait on weekend evening, we told there was a 30 minute wait then not seated for over an hour. We had to inquire as to why we'd not been seated and were told because we'd not closed our bar tab, Ok might have been nice to know considering we told the host we'd be at the bar. They have a full service bar with a very attentive bar staff. Service in general once seated was slow, the variety and quality of food sort of makes up for that issue. If you are a sushi person I feel certain you will enjoy their sushi bar/menu.  My husband had several raw sushi dishes that he enjoyed as well as a veggie roll dish we shared that was very good. My only disappointment was my rice cake, it was very tough, not a lot of taste and dry. My husband \"upgraded\" his rice with meal for fried rice for only $1 but it wasn't even worth the $1!!! It was very much like my fried rice cake, dry, mushy and little to no taste. That said we enjoyed the meal enough that we'd go back again. I'm not sure if our True age is beginning to \"show\" as we found their in house DJ to be playing much to loud. Music with a meal is always nice but when you feel as if you have to shout to hear the person directly next and or across from you, it's not enhancing to the meal. Again all of this said we'd for sure go back, just maybe not on a weekend evening.",

    "text": "This was the first time I ate here.  Met a prospective candidate for lunch.  I gave it 3 stars for the following:  1.  The taste of the House Cucumber Roll was dominated by the cucumber, which probably explains the name.  I had to remove 2 wraps just to taste the Salmon and Tuna.  Priced too high considering you really couldn't taste the fish.  Also the Ponzu sauce was only placed on 1 of the 8 rolls.   2.  Tuna Crunch roll called for \"lightly\" Panko tuna, but the Panko was over done, taking away the taste of the tuna.    Fortunately, the Spider Roll turned out really good.  Considering the overall cost of lunch, with 2 out of the 3 orders below expectations, a 3-star rating was appropriate.  Without the Spider Roll, I would have likely rated a 2 to 2.5 for the experience.",

Then, we ordered our food (again, all at the same time) and the waitress again brought out everyone's order at the table at the same time, but yet again my order didn't come until everyone else was finished eating.  The waitress said that it was a different chef making my order? and didn't apologize for the sushi being so late.  Then, a person in our party ordered another glass of the wine she was having and the waitress brought a glass of the wine I was drinking, not her.  When the bill came, I was still expected to pay full price for my meal and the second glass of wine that I didn't order.....  Food was great, but the waitress we had was less than alright.",

Made a reservation and brought a group there on my birthday, told the hostess on the phone it would be 15-20 people.   People started arriving, and I asked them to seat us. Was told they would not seat us until the WHOLE party had arrived. This place has a VERY small lobby/bar area....having like 12 people in it is pushing it.  Told the man at the host stand this....he just said \"sorry\".  So standing out in the lobby/bar area with a massive group of people is not very fun....while we are just standing there and staring at our empty table. Wasn't even like we could have sat at the bar and ordered some drinks....the bar was already full of patrons.  Pretty embarrassing.",

    "text": "Start by saying the sushi is decent not the worst I've had but not the best either also a little pricey.   Summary: order the sushi and nothing else, don't go on the weekends or you will be at club Nikko's where there is no dance floor but the DJ is pumping out techno so loud you can't hear anyone at your own table, and be ready to pay a pretty penny for mediocre sushi.  Now as for the 2 stars. Went to Nikko's last night for a business dinner and I'm on a no carb diet so I order a NY strip steak with a side salad. Granted I know this is not a steak house and they probably cook one steak a week, but I expected a little better for the 27$ price tag. First off, I asked for ranch as my salad dressing and was told they only have a house dressing. Which is weird since they have literally 8 different full size salads on the menu. I ordered my steak medium rare and when I receive the steak it's barely a quarter inch thick, no was on earth was is an 8oz steak. To top it off it was well done and covered in teriyaki sauce. I sent it back and got back a black and blue steak (raw in the middle) which I much rather eat than a well done steak, but still not what I asked for. That being said service is always on point and quick with the refills and are normally decently friendly.   Side note what is up with the pictures of what I can only assume to be the owner everywhere in different costumes? Also be prepared to see her in rare form on the weekends in a costume or cowboy hat walking around taking pictures with people....",

We came in around 6 PM on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy yet. But my boyfriend says how it's typically pretty busy on the weekends. In fact, on our way out, we noticed a DJ booth set up in the corner towards the front of the restaurant where the host stands were at.   Our server was Jackie tonight. She was so sweet and catered to all of our needs. She was on point with everything! She definitely gets 5 stars.   However, the food gets 4 stars. No complaints about wait time-- All of our food came out promptly. We ordered the sashimi deluxe and calamari as our appetizer. Sashimi was fresh. Calamari had a funny odor it gave off, but it didn't taste bad. It's topped with sweet and sour sauce that I didn't care too much for. We also got a salad that came with this delicious dressing and miso soup that was super flavorful. As for our entrees, my boyfriend got the filet mignon and lobster dish and I ordered the shrimp, scallops, and lobsters dish. In my opinion, it was a tad bit too salty. And I love all things salty!! Or maybe my taste buds were off tonight. I tried my boyfriend's filet mignon, and I'm not a meat/beef person AT ALL but it was pretty soft! I can now see how people say how certain types of steaks can just melt in your mouth. Finished our meal off with red bean tempura ice cream. Pretty good! Overall, it was pretty good here! Will come again. Thanks again, Jackie!",

He stated that he would to look at the security camera to see if they had in fact ordered another entree. The fact was, they never ordered 2 entrees. It was only 1. I am aware of this because I sat directly across from them and observed exactly what they had received. Again, they only received 1 entree.

All so yummy and it's making my mouth watering thinking about them! The owner, Joanna, is a BLAST!! She came over made sure everything was great and mingled with our table! So nice of her! There is a gratuity charge listed on their menu for parties of more than 6 so be mindful but we didn't mind. We tipped more on top just because she was amazing!! Our table loved everything about this place and we will definitely come back again with more friends!! Great service, great food, great experience!",

I'm not sure if it's only on the weekend, but they have a DJ who always plays the best music. The owner is also really friendly and dances with guests, which makes the atmosphere super fun!  I also really enjoy the food! The sushi is great, but my favorite is the Nabe Yaki Udon. Comes with egg, shrimp, and chicken, so good! I also had the chicken yaki soba which was good as well! Most of the menu is pretty pricey, but the noodles dishes are all decent prices.  Would definitely recommend for a fun night out!   I do recommend making a reservation, the wait can be long! There is a parking deck (free), right at the end of the street and a parking lot, so that shouldn't be an issue. One of my favorite places in Charlotte!",

For only $10 we got miso soup, ginger salad, 2 pieces of gioza, fried rice, chicken teriyaki and tempura fried vegetables/shrimp. It was a GREAT deal and everything tasted great too. Wish I got to try the sushi but as far as lunch- go with the bento box!!  Also the ambiance, vibe and interiors were super cool, luxurious and modern.",

I didn't get to experience the thumping music since I came in on a weekday, early evening. There were lots of seats since most of the patrons chose to sit at the bar.  The drinks are very strong, which is always a plus. My date and I ordered calamari, 3 different sushi rolls and seafood fried rice. I wish the rice didn't have imitation crab, but besides that it was filling and delicious.  It's the second best fried rice I've had after Ru San's. The calamari was great, lightly fried- which is a welcome change from some restaurants who serve calamari with more bread coating than squid.  The price is a little higher than normal, but that's expected due to the area. I ate at a sushi place in Steele Creek last week and the price difference wasn't that much between the two. I look forward to returning.",

Located in South End, this restaurant and sushi bar has a bomb Specialty Creation sushi menu that hits on all types of flavor combinations! They've also got full service bar so if you don't like any of their cocktails or want any wine from their large wine menu, you can pretty much ask them to make anything your heart desires.  Service is good. It doesn't get overly busy so request to sit in a booth if you can or sit at the sushi bar and watch them make the rolls! They've even got a private room for if you have a party/celebration.   Recommendations:  * Volcano Roll: shrimp tempura roll topped with a spicy baked mix of scallops, crab, and octopus. If you love warm rolls and/or spicy rolls get this one! * Dancing Queen: steamed asparagus and spicy tuna, topped with spicy guacamole and tempura chips. This roll is cold but super refreshing with the guacamole on it! If you're looking to be adventurous, I would seriously try this one.",

First, the location is close to my work so I was excited about that but the parking situation is terrible, just be ready to hunt for a while.  Second, I got chicken teriyaki with fried rice (extra charge which I was fine with) and miso soup. What I actually got was dry chicken (not overdone but dry as in not sauced) with teriyaki on the side and rice with almost a whole onion chopped in it. Onion is okay but this was just way too much - who really thought that much was a good idea?! As for the sauce, teriyaki is very think and rich until cooked so I really couldn't use the sauce. The soup was just okay so this experience was not great all the way around.  I think I'll probably try it again and remember these things so I can be very specific about how the food should be cooked. Not worth the price when they don't really measure up to any of the other hibachi places.  I didn't try any sushi but I will next time.",

And did I mention that they have great desserts, like the most delightful dish of fried ice cream with whipped cream?  Basically, this restaurant got it all covered.  If you come late at night, it lights up with music...and is an ideal place for a group outing.  You may even catch its owner with her cowboy hat dancing and prancing throughout the restaurant (Yep, this restaurant most definitely has character).  I've also been to the restaurant for lunch, and they offer great discounted specials!  It's much quieter during lunch hours as well.  Service has also been fairly good...no problems as of yet.  There's so much on their menu that I'm looking to try out, can't wait to revisit soon!",

He didn't bring soups for some of the party until we reminded him when the meals arrived.   I ordered a \"round\" of drinks and he came back with only 2 not 4.   CO2 was out in soda gun and we told him yet all drinks continued to come with flat soda.

One we were seated the owner greeted us with a little singing and dancing, and a toast (even though we only had water at this time) to the birthday girl! It was great to see the owner has not lost her touch, still in her cowboy hat walking around, dancing and having fun with her customers.  After ordering our drinks, we started with a variety of appetizers, gyoza, dumplings, calamari, and some others that everyone seemed to enjoy.  As for entrees, everyone ordered a variety of sushi rolls and I got some the tuna roll and nigiri, which was a generous portion and very fresh fish.  I will say the rolls came in 6 pieces where typically you receive 8.  However, I was still full from what I ordered. The drinks were great and the service was on point, filling waters and cocktails and addressing any needs we needed.  We had a party of 10 and all were splitting our bills, yes, we were that group.  However, there were no issues  with the waiter and everyone's bills were on point. Overall, I was happy to see things haven't changed at Nikko and love the atmosphere, music and overall environment especially for a get together like a birthday or fun night out.",

The atmosphere was very modern (I felt like I was in NyC) and the music was poppin. They even had a DJ! Our friends told us in advance about the DJ and loud music so we thought this would be the perfect dinner and drink spot before going out. We even joked later when we went dancing that the music at Nikko was better than the DJ on the dance floor. I guess they have a live DH every Saturday starting at 8.   This place was also packed with birthday, graduation and bachelorette parties-some tables were holding 20+ people so this is a great place for large parties. I recommend making a reservation.   We all started with appetizers and my husband and I got the calamari. The calamari was basic (deep fried), but placed on a bed of lettuce with a spicy Thai sauce. It was tasty. For dinner we all got sushi, but they did have other options including hibachi. The mango tango roll was my favorite roll and it was HUGE! I would get it again.  For drinks I got the cucumber martini, which was on point! Very refreshing.   The owner was also very entertaining as she would jump from table to table and mingle with everyone. You could tell she enjoyed her job.   Overall great time at Nikko and will definitely be back before a night out! Oh and if it's your birthday make sure you tell them ;-) you will get a \"surprise\" treat.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying: I am a HUGE sushi fan. Some friends and I decided to go Nikko's and the staff was very accommodating to our rather large group and were very kind and helpful. I ordered the Rainbow Roll because the sushi was more expensive than what I usually get elsewhere and I didn't want to order anything too extravagant. Our meals came very quickly, which I really appreciated. The sushi unfortunately did not come with a dish for soy sauce so I asked for one and I was quickly accommodated, but I was disappointed that wasabi was not provided. I'm sure they would have accommodated me if I asked for wasabi, but since I already asked for a dish I didn't want to bother our waitress further. The fish tasted fresh, but this is definitely not the best sushi I have ever had. I was honestly disappointed with the mediocrity of the sushi because with the price I was paying, I expected it to be above and beyond my previous experiences.   I also tried my date's shrimp and chicken meal from the dinner menu. The shrimp was cooked well! The meal came with rice and steamed vegetables (squash, zucchini, etc). The vegetables were unfortunately over cooked and neither of us wanted to finish eating them for that reason.   The environment of the restaurant, however, definitely looked appropriate to the price range. It is a very nice place for company outings and special occasions if your focus is a trendy and sleek atmosphere.   In all, I would give Nikko's 3 stars: one for the staff, another for their environment, and a third for the fact that the food was not terrible. They lost two stars in my book because their food did not live up to the price.",

Not to mention our waitress didn't bother bringing out wasabi or ginger or soy sauce which is a given. We had to wait 5 minutes to get that!

    "text": "DO NOT go to this place. I rarely leave reviews but I feel the need to warn EVERYONE and share how awful our experience was.  Our group of 8 women had reservations at 8:45pm on Saturday night. We arrived early, around 8:30pm and had everyone present. It was for our good friends bachelorette party and we told them this was our one night to go out.  The table was not ready for us until 9:20pm.  After we sat down we sat there for a long time before a waiter or anyone even acknowledged our existence.  One finally came by to introduce himself, took our drink orders and promised to bring waters for us first, but that never happened.  It was about 9:45 and still no waters and no update from anyone - and it was impossible to wave down anyone that worked there. I went to the host stand to find someone who could at least bring us waters - JUST WATERS.  And kindly explained our situation to a man who said he worked there but was not a manager. He apologized and said he would find our waiter. 10 more minutes go by.. still no water or update. Finally a petite woman in a cowboy hat came by to hastily take our food orders.  3rd time we ask for water.  We finally were given waters by one if the hosts / managers - NO apology or acknowledgement of the delay or neglect in service.  It is now after 10pm and we are starving and have no alcoholic beverages to at least calm our impatience.  Again I hunt down a waiter who defensively said the bar is backed up.. which I understand happens but does NOT explain why you can't at least bring us WATER for 45 minutes. When we were finally brought our \"cocktails\" they again were hastily delivered in dirty wine glasses (none of us ordered wine), no ice/garnish/anything.  I ordered some fancy cucumber vodka mixed drink and it was basically bright green warm cucumber sugar juice (if that's a thing?!) served with no ice plain in a wine glass.  There were 3 old fashions, (we only ordered one) and all the other cocktails were delivered similarly to mine.  Basically just warm juice in dirty wine glasses. Anytime we asked a question (if we could manage to flag someone down and get their attention long enough) we received very defensive, rude replies. No apologies, no acknowledgment, absolutely no attempt to resolve the issue or compensate.  We were lied to, told by two different people that they punched in our orders 20 minutes ago, then another person said they \"just punched it in\" and meanwhile workers are scrambling and running around with no organization.  It is now 10:30pm, we haven't gotten very far. We have tried our best to be patient and give them the benefit of the doubt but the lack of service and communication was feeling like a bad joke.  Not to mention it was our best friends BACHELORETTE and we were all super hangry at this point. I managed to pull our waiter aside and told him that we were going to have to leave.  We ended up leaving and went to 5 Church who MORE than made up for our horrific experience! They CONGRATULATED our bride (another small gesture we didn't receive from the discombobulated jerks at Nikko), gave us a beautifully placed table, AMAZING service, complimentary champagne, and were so kind, fun, and accommodating to our group.  The food & cocktails were pretty close to perfect, they even gave us a few drinks on the house, and brought a dessert out for our bride at the end.  Even though it was 11:30pm before any of us had any food and completely ruined our other plans for the evening, the waiters & staff at 5 Church totally redeemed the night for us.   We spoke to a few other groups local to Charlotte about our Nikko experience and they said \"yeah... I've heard similar complaints about that place. The food can be pretty good but the service, management, and overall experience is pretty awful. Wouldn't recommend\".    LONG STORY SHORT - if you are a group of normally tempered people trying to have an enjoyable evening with friends and avoid being pushed to starvation and blind rage, DO NOT step foot in Nikko.  Better yet, go to 5 Church instead! Or McDonalds. Literally anywhere else you're gonna be better off than this awful establishment.",

Soup salad and edamame came out within minutes.  That's a great thing. Sushi came out quickly after which is awesome. I asked our sweet attentive waitress twice that I wanted it spread out time wise but that's ok  Food was amazing. Volcano roll and Cowboy roll then scallop app at end to keep us there a little longer.  Free valet parking a plus!!! Got there right at 7pm and gone by 8pm.",

Our server was friendly and helpful. The shrimp shumai was good and cooked well. I got a roll of sushi and it was fresh. My only 2 complaints is that I asked if they had chili oil and they said they did and when I received it I got sesame oil and I went to the bathroom and I saw a worker there who used the bathroom and she didn't really wash her hands. She turned the water on and put her hands underneath and didn't even use soap! Gross.",

    "text": "I've been to Nikko's several times over the years, and have always had fun while enjoying the ambiance, the food and Nikko herself!  That's right,  most evenings Nikko is walking around in her black or white cowboy hat greeting (and sometimes dancing with) patrons and taking pictures.    As far as the food - if you love sushi this is probably a top 3 spot in CLT for sushi.  They've got a loong sushi bar w/several chefs creating a variety of unique and classic sushi options.  I usually run one or two of their daily sushi roll specials.  They also have your classic hibachi/stir-fry/teriyaki-style selections served with steamed veggies and rice - try the salmon.   Service is usually straight here, although I wouldn't say spectacular.  For example, they don't hide the fact that they are closing in 45min and want you to leave - hehe.  Regardless of how busy they are, food always seems to come out in a timely manner and just as you ordered it.  My one complaint is sometimes this place lacks a bit of couth.  I am all for a DJ on Friday & Saturday nights - but does it have to be so extremely loud you can't carry on a convo w/ the person next to you?  If you are looking for a laid-back, quiet experience this is NOT the place.  Complimentary valet parking.   The food is always exceptional.  The service is good.  The ambiance is modern, hip and trendy.  I will def be back,  but could you just turn the music down a bit though?",

The shortage of stars stem from our 1:30-45 minute wait even though my Bestie made reservations for 8:30pm, we didn't get seated until almost 10pm!!!! They did comp is a round of tequila shots but it was still rather annoying. Then when seated we had this new waiter which we probably shouldn't have had because we had a party of 9(birthday celebration). He took drink order and food orders then when they were brought out he didn't know who had what meal or drink. And he acted like he didn't care. I also ordered rice with me rolls and never received them. I didn't remind him because I was waiting for the grand finale....My Bill!!! And lo and behold he tried to charge me for the rice. Smh. One of the party people discreetly ordered the signature penis ice cream thing that they do for birthdays and welp I hope you guessed it...there was nothing shaped like a penis AND he brought the thing out to ME and placed beside me and walked away. Candle had already been diffused. And yes the guy distinctly told him it was the Woman in yellow birthday, I had on a blue jean shirt. Again smh. To add another insult to injury about 10 minutes later we see the crew bringing out the real \"penis\" thing AND they were singing happy birthday. So that was it for me. I had had enough and was going to let my tip speak for itself. But before I'm done reviewing this place when he did the bills he charged one girl twice and she saw that immediately on her phone and he claimed he didn't and said that she was wrong and nothing could be done about it. So manager is needed and he comped the girl her entire bill. That was nice of him. I paid cash but the others that paid with the card the NEW GUY didn't give pens for them to sign their receipts. Might I add he gave two people empty tins which should've contained their bills so we had to call him back for that as well. Needless to say this was an adventurous night. Oh and the bathroom was horrible, there was tissue strewn everywhere. And I can't remember what my drink tasted like because I was too focused on every other wrong thing going on around me. This happened on September 22",

There's also a private area for birthdays and special events. During my first visit, I noticed a DJ in the corner, not sure if this is a weekend thing or not.   Personally I love the sushi! Endless options of unique flavors and combinations. My cousin and I dined here a few weeks ago. She's NEVER tried Sushi before! So this was a first! Everything was perfection!! The service is great, I've never had a bad experience. Parking sucks, so your better off with valet parking.   There's lots of options for non-sushi lovers. I plan to try the Ramen during my next visit. The Cocktails!!! Amazing!! Half off on Thursdays! Be sure to try the Pear Sakitni!! So delish!!",

The cherry on top our server Melissa brought out our dessert and had written Happy Anniversary on the plate. Great experience!",

First--there is a ton of construction going on in the vicinity, so you just might miss it. No worries, turn around and find it! They offer complimentary valet and I DO suggest you take advantage of that!   Vibes--beautiful decor with a sprawling bar! Once you step inside, it's hard to believe you're still in Charlotte! As I entered, I was greeted by the DJ playing some classic hits and I literally could NOT stop bopping!   The owner, so sweet took me to my table as I waited on my friend (for girls night) and emphatically said \"it's party time!\" I loved her energy -- and you can tell she cares about her customers and their experience!   Since I was in the mood for sushi, I didn't even entertain the idea of ordering anything else, but their menu is expansive and similar to other Japanese restaurants.   We ordered a variety of sushi rolls and asked for all the sauces (trust me--do this...and sample each one. They are so good!)   If you're looking for a sushi place, with good vibes, give them a visit and let me know how you like it!!",

    "text": "I used to like this place. Went to Nikko last night with a group of 11 people. We had a reservation for 8pm, and weren't seated until closer to 8:30 at which point we were told a round of drinks was complimentary because of the long wait. The manager told us the delay was because \"the DJ was too good\" .... oh and the drinks never came.  The owner came and took our order at 8:45 in which we ordered drinks again and appetizers (TWO EDAMAME) and our dinner.   At 9, a new waitress came to our table bring a random assortment of about 5 drinks. Meanwhile, people from the table were having to go up to the bar to get anything. We had to ask for WATER 2-3 times before any came around 9:30.   Fast forward to 9:45 - AN HOUR AFTER WE ORDERED - and the Edamame and a few random drinks arrived. We were told that they were out of limes, out of DRINK GLASSES, etc.   10:30, food arrives sporadically. The order isn't even correct. Finally, by 11pm after speaking with every employee possible in the place, we agreed that we would not be paying for the food as the night was unbearable and highly unprofessional. They explained they were missing a couple servers that night. They charged us for the alcohol (which was all over the place).   Meanwhile ... a DJ is blaring loud obnoxious music the entire time. This was an absolute terrible experience and the most horrific display of customer service I have ever witnessed. If you are truly short staffed, then it would behoove you to explain to your customers what is going on and to set the expectation that you will have ZERO service. We would have never eaten there, and will never be back.",

A DJ was killing it - great music selections - and I was nervous there would be a crazy wait. There was, but there was plenty of room at the sushi bar so the bf and I decided we'd eat there.  I loved sitting at the sushi bar. Those chefs were on fire the entire time. Our server, Melissa, was like a ninja and always popped up when we needed water or to check on us. She was super positive and nice.   Our rolls were delicious! We received them promptly which was even more impressive based on the volume of tickets the chefs had.

The owner is lovely, you can see her going around to each table and checking on them!  I've always thought the food was okay. I've had better for cheaper. Drinks were better than food. The food doesn't hit the spot for me. Sushi or the appetizers. The most recent time I ordered myself 3 appetizers and 1 roll (in the past I just got rolls, and wanted to see if I'd have better luck with appetizers) Everyone in the group ordered and we just shared. There was quite a bit left over - and we rarely have left overs.   I'd go here for the environment and popular vote of my dinner party - but not 100% for the food.   The music is really loud (and great selection! - there's been a DJ each time I've been) which is fine if your group is ready to go out but just an FYI if you're looking to have a more intimate setting.",

Yum, not overly strong and love the lycees  My usual: edamame and seaweed salad. Typical and nothing to complain about.  Super crunchy roll sushi: cooked sushi with shrimp tempura. Sooo yum..   Joanne (owner) was lively as ever. Sent our bday girl some birthday bombs (shots) and overall everybody was happy.. Our waitress was on point. Water was alway filled.

It was great seeing other customers got out of their seats and do the \"Cha cha slide\" *The sushi bar was spectacular with the back walls lighted up with different colors. *My lychee martini was on point, strong alcohol topped with the actual lychee fruit. It was so good, I had two lychee martinis and was already feeling the music! The Bloody Mary tasted great!  *Service from waitstaff was on point, we moved and shuffled around our seats and the nice server managed to get our checks right!  *The decor was impeccable, nicely decorated with authentic Japanese statues, trinkets, and pictures of geishas. If you look closely, the pictures is the owner of the restaurant in her beautiful silk kimonos.  *The dinner and drink menu is intensive with specials.  *Sushi to Teriyaki hibachi entrees. *Sashimi and raw oysters were fresh.

The ambience is great if you don't mind the loud music.",

We couldn't decide on which sushi rolls or entrees we wanted as we wanted a little bit of everything, so the waitress was very kind to give some recommendations and we ended up with quite a few delectable dishes.  The Ballantyne roll was amazing, the Japanese fried chicken was quite delightful as well.  The decor was very modern and chic, the music gave it a nice ambiance as well.  The prices weren't too bad, but just a tad bit higher than some of the other places I've eaten great sushi from.  Around 8pm, a DJ comes in and plays some really great selections.  Needless to say, we had a blast and will be back soon!",

Ok so this place is gonna be packed with every seat reserved soon?? The place straight dead!! I absolutely feel like me and my friend was discriminated against!! I told him NO, and we hike our butts to Rai Lay a Block down and had the best sushi and service. I would never go to this place again",

I am allergic to shell fish so, I order the salmon and mixed vegetable salad. It was 'ok' nothing too special! This is a sushi restaurant so word of advice get the sushi and enjoy",

    "text": "If I could give this place a negative star I would! Tonight I attended a birthday party celebration that SHOULD have ended with a great dinner. Unfortunately not only did we have a completely disgusting experience, the night wad ruined because our string or waiters to management insisted on arguing with the group about incorrect food orders, cold food, and overall disgusting attitudes from simple requests. Ive never had a manager speak to a group of grown women as disrespectful ever in my life. A quick example of the service we received: Two out of the group of 10 women who ordered food selected a flash fried sushi roll and a deep fried sushi roll. Both initially came to the table freezing cold. We politely asked out second water for the night, after we were traded out with another because our initial waiter had a massive attitude bringing out JUST waters to the table, to bring out warmer sushi rolls. Mind you these two are put in a fryer, one longer than the other, and should not be freezing cold. They came out with the retuned sushi rolls and insisted the deep fried roll shouldn't be warm. The flash fried roll was warmer than the deep friend roll. The manager literally argued with one of the grown women in our group stating it shouldn't be listed on their menu as deep fried but flash fried and isn't a hot roll. He even had the nerve to go get a menu to prove a point not realizing on the menu it specifically states the deep fried in bold letters lol. Once he was proven wrong he crumbled the menu up in our faces and stated\" Im not going to argue with you all night', and proceeded to walk away from our table. Literally those exact words in front of a group of women who just came out to enjoy a friends birthday. The young lady who ordered the deep fried roll was so upset she couldn't eat and left the restaurant to sit in the lobby after coming in from out of town to celebrate with a friend and feeling completely disrespected by this member of management. THAT is just ONE of the disgusting encounters we had with this restaurant over the course of an hour and a half. Please be mindful the atmosphere is nice, the dj was excellent, so you will be fooled initially. However, the SERVICE and FOOD are well overrated for the price you have to pay. Management sets the tone in any business. As a member of leadership your job is to resolve the consumers issues with the mind that they keep your business running and you stepping into a position to provide a service. Those men and women from waiters to management were rude and completely untrained or aware of True leadership and customer service. Truly a disgusting experience and I will tell everyone I know.",

    "text": "My friends and were planning a girls weekend and I made reservations for 12 at Nikko's a month and a half ago. We ended up needing to push our reservation back and they were very accommodating. Get to the restaurant at 8:45 pm (reservation was at 9), I checked in with the guy at the front and told him we were early, but wanted to check in. He said it would be a few minutes. I told him that was fine as we were 15 minutes early. Five after 9 and they haven't called my name. My friends goes to check and is told 10 minutes. 10 minutes comes and goes, we go check again. We are told that the table they are going to give to us is still seated (they have already paid, but haven't gotten up). About 9:30 I go to follow up again and I'm told the same thing. At this point I'm thinking 1. Either let the table know hey we are extremely crowded tonight and have a long wait, so that they can wrap up their conversation or 2. stop seating these parties of 3 or 4 people who are just walking and start pushing tables together, to accommodate the multiple parties you have waiting . The guy at the front says I can get you a drink on me, well sir there are 11 people in my party and it's not really fair for me to be the only one to get something and not everyone who is waiting, I said what about the rest of my party. He just looked at me and squeezed my arm. At this point I notice that there is another customer who keeps going to the hostess stand as well. I went to ask him what time was his reservation and he tells me his was at 9 for a party of 10 and he keeps getting the same run around. Finally get seated about 9:45 (45 minutes later), get to the table and there aren't enough menus, so we are sharing menus, its another 10 minutes before the waiter actually gets to our table. He finally comes, brings us water, takes our orders. Food comes out and it's even more problems. My friend sitting across from me  ordered one of the same sushi rolls I did but she asked for no mayo. He brings the plate out with my other sushi roll on it, but no mayo on the roll we had a like. He goes did you all switch seats, I said no we didn't. He goes oh ok I'll fix this. I said well just have the roll prepared with everything and I'll just take my other roll from her when it comes out. He brings back the roll still with no mayo. One of my friends asked for the tempura app and got the tempura roll. Another friend wanted shrimp with veggies and got the tempura roll. She told him that wasn't what she asked for, and explained what she wanted. He came back with tempura shrimp and veggies (Still not what she wanted). When the checks came, we were all ready to pay and had our cards/money ready. It took about 20 minutes for him to cash us out. When he came back with our cards and receipts he had the nerve to say gratuity was already included and if we wanted to add extra we could. We could clearly see that gratuity was included when we looked at our bill the first time, and his service nor the service we received at the restaurant was worth what was included, so to basically ask for extra  was an insult. The manager,  nor the owner (who was in the restaurant) apologized for our 45 minute wait or the multiple mix ups that happened with our food. The best part of the night was the live DJ they had.  I will not be going back nor recommending this place to anyone else.",

    "text": "I should start by saying the food isn't bad. It was actually quite tasty.   I'm giving them 3 stars for 2 reasons:  1. Price was a little high for the quality of the food. We ended up spending over $50 for 2 entrees and and appetizer. We each ordered the teriyaki chicken entree and as I mentioned earlier, it was good. We had the firecracker shrimp for an appetizer and that was delicious but a little over battered.   2. Atmosphere. The place feels like you walked into a some weird fusion between a high end night club where you might find pro athletes and musicians / some type of Asian mafia in the back room.   Staff seemed friendly enough and we didn't have to wait long at all for our food.   I should mention we did not try the sushi which seems to be the route we should have gone after reviewing others comments.",

Of course I washed mine before the food came, but no towels at the table? Unheard of.  It's a bit pricey. It is a little loud (we were there on a weeknight- I was told weekends are very very loud). Service was 2 stars. It was a week night, not busy, but our server was not paying attention enough that we needed to remind her she did not bring everything we ordered. Yet, 3 stars is totally warranted if only because the sashimi was so fresh and delicious. (The roll we ordered was some Americanized concoction so I won't hold it against the restaurant.) I'll come back for the sashimi any day.",

    "text": "Both of us ordered the $14 Tonkotsu Ramen.  Took 25 minutes for the food to arrive, and the soup was only lukewarm.  Not a good sign already.  Things only went downhill from here.  The noodles weren't Japanese ramen but more like the Korean variety (soft, not curly), and the broth was way too salty.  The pork was ok but the cold soup and wrong type of ramen had ruined it for me.  Seriously this was worse than frozen ramen from a Japanese grocery store.  I know they call themselves a sushi bar and Ramen may not be their specialty, but at this price point I had really expected a whole lot better and won't be returning.",

The music may have been a little loud considering the place was empty but 90s hip hop is so classic it kind of worked. Tried a few rolls including the Dancing Queen specialty roll. This restaurant is on their sushi game for sure and the rolls were excellent. In all this was a very good experience and would be four stars, but reaches five stars because the service was outstanding",

I hate to leave negative reviews, but after being a loyal customer for years, even as the food and service declined, my recent visit will be my last.  The sushi quality was unacceptable, and the service was downright rude.  So sad to see service go down hill.  Oh well.  Glad there are plenty of other options.",

I was also impressed with the fact that we had 8pm reservations but the guest of honor didn't arrive until 8:45 and they still held her table ! Other than that, that was the highlight. It was a table of 10 and 2 servers yet they failed to ever be on the same page. One waiter took on side of the tables order, while the other waitress seemed to be no where in sight. Service was extremely slow and the waiters were hard to come around when you needed something as simple as a fork. We had multiple misunderstandings throughout the night which maybe I can attribute to the DJ. Overall the food was pretty good and I would definitely give it another shot with a smaller party.",
