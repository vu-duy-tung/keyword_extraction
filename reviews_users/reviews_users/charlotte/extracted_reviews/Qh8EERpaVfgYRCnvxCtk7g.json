    "text": "We were here for New Year's Eve, and the place was not very busy. The upstairs VIP with the DJ seemed like it might have be \"jumpin'\", but downstairs was not very exciting... Individuals and couples occupied the booths on the other side of the bar... The heat lamp was not on outside... Based on their advertising, we were in after 11 and paid the cover ($10) ... However, when the flyer said free wings 11:30-12:30, I'm not sure what they were talking about; we ordered drinks ($9/shot of Ciroc) then asked about the wings since it was after 11:30, at this point. The bartender looked at me and said \"all we have are hot wings\"... I nodded and said \"that's fine.\" He said \"10?\" then as he cashed us out, he also added the hot wings to our drinks. I wasn't too worried about paying for the wings since we were out with friends trying to have a good time... However! The hot wings were $11, and the worst part is that they only gave us 9 wings! Smh.  Then, to make matters worse, the champagne toast they advertised was apparently not available to men because my boyfriend and my friend's boyfriend both tried (as we were behind them), and the bartender didn't give them to us until my girlfriend asked.  We were not impressed.",

Chase took good care of me, the weather was fab! Saturday there is a pianist. Now to the food: their secret balsamic  dressing recipe needs to be whispered in my ear-- wow!! Had steak which was cooked to temperature & tender. Pimento cheese hash was off the hook!!! Give me a shovel, hello!!!  Everyone was attentive and friendly. The inside  atmosphere is lively and classy but not too stuffy or loud. Tv in bar for basketball fans on this important evening!!  Will return next year for my annual conference-- can't wait to see predictable quality with some fun, creative additions!!",

    "text": "Really enjoyed our dinner here.  Great atmosphere. Minor downside: Our waitress was a little \"cool\" but I don't think she was getting my husband's humor or was maybe just having a bad day. She wasn't rude but not what I expect of a higher end waitstaff.  On the other hand, the hostess (even though new) was super friendly and cheerful as was the bartender.  Now, onto the highlights - LOVED the food here...Apps: Was looking forward to the tuna tacos from the website instead they had Grilled Tuna Tacos.  Yum - quite a bit of kick and very tasty, nice presentation. Small portion so I'm glad we ordered some other apps for the table.  Drunken Mussels - really good.  My hubby isn't a mussel fan but he was scarfing them up.  Lamb Sliders - very flavorful, nice presentation too.  I think I could easily come here and just do tapas for dinner.  I had the Shrimp and Risotto (twist on Shrimp and Grits).  It was awesome.  I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of the dish. Our friends had a steak and the grilled salmon. They both thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  My husband got the rack of lamb and he also raved about how good it was and prepared perfectly.  Since my stepson will be attending UNCC in the fall, we'll be back in this area and I suspect we will be making this one of our frequent stops when in town.",

The pickles were good.  We order crab legs, rack of lamb, pastas, filet, gyro, seared tuna.... everyone said their food was good.  Overall great evening in this establishment.",

    "text": "We came here on our wedding anniversary last year and decided to do the same this year with another couple.  I was so very disappointed.  Reservations got screwed up; I requested 7pm but they had me for 5pm.  (I think I had made my reservations online at around 5pm)  Not too big of a deal.  We waited at the bar, had a drink and appetizers.  It was nice of them to offer the first round of drinks on the house.  Bangin Shrimp and seared tuna were excellent; steamed mussels were fresh but because I prefer wine & garlic prep over their spicy broth, I didn't quite care for it.  We also were advised that they just recently had an ownership change.  'Gasp!!'  Different menu and some of the chefs had changed.  They no longer had their fantastic crab cakes in the appetizer list.  We had that last year and we were so looking forward to it!    In retrospect, we should have left after drinks and appetizers.  Dinner was what ruined it all.  My friend's seared tuna dinner was not warm at all.  It appeared it was not served immediately and cooled off. Tuna, rice and veggies were all cool.  She had it taken back and they re-did it and they promptly served.  My husband's meal was pathetic.  He ordered the surf & turf which should have been alaskan crab legs and a 6 oz sirloin w/ white cheddar mashed potatoes.  1) This dish was also sitting out instead of being served immediately.  So naturally, nothing was warm including the mashed potatoes 2)  The sirloin was complete junk.  Three small bites of steak and the sirloin was done because the rest was fat and gristle.  They should be ashamed of serving that cut of meat on a sirloin plate because it should have been throw away meat.  3)  Alaskan crab?  I think not.  Let's say snow crab so naturally there was very little crab meat to pull out of it. He is typically not one to have a meal taken back and he didn't on this one either.   For $24, a complete waste.  My other friend had a burger and he was happy with his meal. I had the seared salmon dinner which must have been the last dish cooked before serving because my salmon was hot, although the rice and veggies were a little cool.  Our waitress was pleasant but her attentiveness borders fair-poor.  It was a very long wait between drinks.  We had ordered more drinks (3 martini's and 1 beer) but neither of us had ONE drink throughout our dinner.  I mean, one of us had a bottle of beer, yet couldn't get that served?  We didn't even have iced water served until after our meal was served.  It may be more the bar at fault but I think the waitress shares some of that fault.  After this experience, I highly doubt we will entertain dinner here again. I didn't like the menu and the meal itself was comparable to an Applebee's but certainly not the price of Applebee's!  Perhaps just a drink and appetizers but that's it.",

    "text": "My experience with this restaurant was really... odd. My husband and I were in the area for a concert and decided to stop here for dinner beforehand. It looked pretty cool from the outside - trendy, hookah bar set up on the patio, etc.   Once inside, we were seated quickly by someone who looked like he was probably a manager. The problem, though, was that we ended up going to three tables before we found one that wasn't broken. The first was a booth where the seat was completely deattached, the second was a table that wobbled so much you'd spill your drink. We ended up at another booth that was fine... but had caused damage to the wall it was up again.   The decor is weird. It looks like they're trying to be modern but the furniture is outdated and damaged. Plus, it wasn't very clean. From our booth, you could see a shelf that lead to the bar area and it was covered in hair and dust. There was trash on it that had fallen behind the bar as well... can they not see that??  Our waitress was actually very attentive and sweet; very knowledgeable about the menu and willing to give her advice. She was pretty quick considering they were very under staffed.  The food was mediocre at best. My husband had the FireWater Burger and I had the FireWater Chicken. You'd think these would be pretty awesome since they're named after the restaurant but they were 'ok'. I think the burger was better than the chicken but his fries were super bland. My chicken was actually pretty tasty but the presentation was disgusting. I don't even want to describe what the plate looked like. I can imagine that it has been sent back in the past because of the way it looks. The good news, is that the veggies are fresh and pretty flavorful.  We also ordered the cream of broccoli soup before our meal. This was actually pretty good! The broccoli was fresh and added a little \"crunch\" which was unique. My only critique is that it was a little salty but that could just be my taste.  I also found it odd that they didn't have beverage napkins, etc. There was nothing on the table to soak up the condensation from your glasses and so the table was always wet. At one point (because the table wasn't level) water actually started dripping off of the table on to my lap.  There seemed to be live music going on upstairs; I think they do private events. We couldn't help but laugh, though, when we saw a microphone wire hanging randomly from the staircase going upstairs. It actually swung and hit another customer in the head at one point.  The bar looked kind of neat so if you go back, maybe check out the bar or the patio. Or, just go to Applebee's across the street.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner last night after purchasing a Groupon for the restaurant. It's a nice and clean restaurant with some friendly staff. I was a bit nervous because when we walked in at 6pm with a reservation I was shocked to see that there were only two other tables sat, and two more came in while we ate. The place is plenty big but just didn't draw a crowd by the time we left at a little after 7. Despite the quietness of the place, the food was excellent and the service was decent. Oh, and the best thing about going then was that Saturday's are 1/2 price bottle of wine nights, so we got a bottle for a little more than the price of one glass.   Our waitress was either new or having an off-night. We had to ask her if there were any specials and we also had to confirm that it was 1/2 price bottle of wine night. The other waitress serving some of the other tables did a much better job of informing the customers of what the restaurant offered. However, our waitress was very attentive and checked on us multiple times throughout the course of our dinner.  For an appetizer we had the salmon flatbread ($8). I was expecting a crispy, cheesy appetizer but it was four huge sandwich wedges of the smoked salmon and cold, mushy pita with cream cheese. The salmon tasted wonderful but I think I was anticipating a crunch that just wasn't meant to be.   For dinner I had the 12oz ribeye ($24) that was served with hand-cut fries. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was extremely tender. It was also one of the leanest ribeyes I had ever ordered at a restaurant. Sadly, the fries were a bit soggy and oily, but at least they were fresh and not frozen. The miss' got the seafood pasta ($16) which contained fresh, homemade pasta mixed with shrimp and scallops. The homemade pasta was awesome and the scallops were cooked perfectly.   All in all, it was a great night. The half-priced bottle of wine, the steak and the seafood pasta were all delicious. I wasn't ecstatic with our appetizer but that wouldn't stop me from going back and trying something else. I would definitely go back to Firewater again, especially on a Saturday night!",

    "text": "This review has more to do with the staff and food, than the restaurant itself...as I did not actually have the time to visit.  While staying at the adjacent Hilton, I had the pleasure to meet the Executive Sous Chef, who was hosting the evening's happy hour in the hotel's \"Executive Lounge\". I found him to be amiable; and more importantly, the food was outstanding. They had prepared a buffet of \"small plate\" type food...foie gras with a tart apple compote-type-thing (I don't know the proper culinary term, sorry) and baked brie. There were also these pot-roast \"cones\", which were also delicious. All-in-all, some of the best fare I've had during my week long visit to the Charlotte area.  They had also put out some menus for us to peruse, and although only 1  of the items we tasted (baked brie) was actually on the restaurant menu, I am very confident that an evening here would be well spent. They only get 4 instead of 5 because, although very very good, the food I tried was still in a buffet format...and nothing that isn't made to order and delivered direct to your awaiting palette will be perfect.  Being that the only other \"high end\" restaurant anywhere  near here is The Melting Pot (blah), I'm pretty certain this is probably the best restaurant in town...or at least in North Charlotte.   I look forward to visiting the actual restaurant the next time I am in the area, and hopefully upgrading to 5 stars then.  Cheers.",

    "text": "Okay, let's get the good parts out of the way... The food was really good. I had the FireWater salad, which had dark greens, cranberries, candied pecans, apples, goat cheese & balsamic viegarette. It was super tasty, but kinda small for the price. I also got the veggie medley & coconut rice. They're sides, but I don't eat meat, so I was happy. I felt though, like the total of $9 for some rice & veggies was a bit high. It's JUST rice and veggies, y'all. My husband got the blackened tilapia fish tacos. He said they were very good, but the meal only came with two, and for the price, there probably should have been three. He also got the cheddar mashed potatoes, which I sampled and they were very creamy and smooth. All in all, I would give the food four stars, but it really wasn't super special or unique. Not many options for vegetarians, but that happens.   So, the rest... there were two groups of loud women there, and we were sat between them, which sucked because we were there for a quiet dinner out. We asked to be moved. The waiter obliged, understandingly. Once we were moved, we were bugged again by the awful club music. I am all about some LMFAO at the gym, but not on a romantic dinner date. We also were serenaded by Lil John & Rhiana. Blah. I went to the restroom before leaving & it was a hot mess. There was tp everywhere. The counter/sink area was kinda nasty, as was the floor. Two of three stalls were totally unusable. The air in the restaurant wasn't moving much & I felt sticky/flushed the whole time.  The waiter was nice and attentive, which was a plus and made the experience tolerable.   Bcause it didn't really give me that \"wow\" feeling, I probably would not recommend this place to a friend or go back on my own, but if I had to go for a group event, I could deal.",

There are some items my friends have gotten that they haven't been thrilled with, but the staff did everything they could to make her happy.   They have a new chef, so definitely check them out if you haven't done so recently!",

Then the manager said \"oh that's for the Lake Norman location.\" Well NO- the website says it's at the Charlotte location. Plus we got there at 2:15ish and began asking about the special then the manager said it was until 2:30 which by this time it was 2:30 and on top of all that he was terribly RUDE. We ended up getting the watered down Mimosas for #10. But this place is NOT where you want to spend your hard earned money- he didn't appreciate our business at all!   I DONT RECOMMEND FIREWATER.   Food was Mediocre.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me so I decided to try. My husband and I visited on a Friday night. From the jump we waited about 10-15 minutes to even be acknowledged by host. The host was busy being a host to others in front of us AS WELL as being a waiter. Yes he was trying to multitask. Short staffed maybe? Once we finally made it to the host table the first thing he stated was, \"I have bad news. There is absolutely no tables available for us to be seated at\". Mind you my husband and I had a reservation and we were on time for reservation. Once I mentioned that we had a reservation, they did accommodate us by moving a table from some random non-used corner and placed two chairs to it for us. The same host was out waiter. He took our drink order, brought our drinks, and took our appetizer order. Then he disappeared. We had to flag down multiple waiters to go check our food. We ordered a Caesar salad and bangin shrimp. It took about 30 minutes or so even get our appetizers. We eventually got our entrees. My husband ordered the \"Cajun rajun\" pasta (I believe that's the correct name) and I ordered the filet migon entree. Both were just okay. Nothing special about either. I told waiter I wanted my steak with little pink-medium well. When I got it there was way more pink! I sent back to cook longer. When he brought back out it didn't even look like it cooked more because there was still the same amount of pink. I didn't send back again. We just decided to get our check to pay and leave. Besides the good drink specials and the music I would not return for food. This could be a good spot for late night drinks and music. My husband got $2 bud light beer and I believe my pomegranate martini was $9. They definitely have to get their customer service issues together.",

    "text": "This restaurant is easy to get to when meeting my North Charlotte friends.  The interior is nice, and it also features a beautiful outdoor area. I met a friend for dinner recently and was immediately seated and offered a drink.  When my friend arrived, it took him a little longer to get a drink, and they happened to be out of the beer he requested.  However, the waiter brought him a similar beverage.  We ordered the fried pickles with Ranch dressing.  The pickles were thick sliced, and they were not greasy. For his entree, my friend ordered a rib sandwich.  It came with fries, and he also ordered the Mac and cheese.  He was pleased with the generous amount of food. I am a vegetarian who happens to like Cobb salads without the chicken and bacon.  However, when I ordered the salad as such, the waiter began to laugh and act like I was foolish to leave off the meat.  \"If that's how you want it,\" he chuckled.  I should not have had to tell him this, but I instructed him to include whatever extra veggies were available on the salad.  This is Charlotte, people.  This is not Morganton, NC, where you have illiterate servers who become dumbfounded when they discover that you don't like meat.  He would not have batted an eye if I requested no avocado.  But, the chef made up for the waiter's lack of finesse.  A salad was delivered, complete with egg, avocado, tomatoes and grilled vegetables.  My only complaint is that the Gorgonzola crumbles were few to none, but, all in all, the salad was good.",

The waitress was attentive, sweet, relatively quick, but used every single pet name (sweetie, honey, etc, etc) known to mankind.  The menu was in one of those plastic sleeve things and was somewhat sticky.   I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but for some reason a week later it sticks out, not even in a draft I'd penned: the glassware seemed outdated. I never notice things like glassware, but its just etched in my mind. Anyway....  Had an order of the wings, hot.  They were somewhat bland in flavor but had a good crisp to them.  The carrots served with them were bendy in the \"they've been sitting a while somewhere humid\" way.    Shrimp tacos were next, they were served on flour tortillas with coconut rice. I found them a bit slimy, and overly sauced. The coconut rice was very, very sweet, and dry.  If I come back to Charlotte, I'll skip this place.  Clean from what I saw, but only visited the bar area. Heard live music as I walked by another night.",

I don't why, but the exterior just doesn't appeal to me.  Once inside....much of the same story... The decor is um..odd.

The NY strip: Now this is a steak. Far from Del Frisco's, but great cut and what a steak should look like.   The drinks: As the name implies, they seem to specialize in cocktails..Martinis.  $8 Dirty Martini: Yea buddy. This price might be the cheapest in town.",

Then I asked for a French coffee and was brought a martini with brandy and Kahlua.  When I said that wasn't what I ordered they poured it into a pint glass with coffee and cream. I was a little disappointed because the appetizers (calamari) and the entree (NY strip and salmon) were delicious.",

We were told by the incompetent hostess they couldn't give us an exact time, could be 15 minutes to an hour. The restaurant was less than 2/3 full and I could see 6 tables that were empty the whole time we waited.  In the next hour they seated only 2 parties and one of them got up and left after they saw the depleted brunch buffet and lack of service. We were the only party left and the restaurant still felt mostly deserted when I cornered the hostess again and she said she still couldn't give us a time estimate.  When I asked for the manager she reluctantly said he told her she wasn't allowed to seat anyone, that they were \"basically closed\" and it could be 45 minutes more, she didnt know (even though their brunch wasn't scheduled to end until well over an hour later). They were going to let us sit there and never seat us! The manager refused to come speak to me.  I would really like to see this pathetic excuse for a restaurant go out of business and a real dining establishment open in its place.",

We found this place online and where we got there the signage was a little old looking.  It looked like a bar and not a restaurant.  When we were seated I looked around and noticed that the decoration was like my grandmother tried to decorate old timey about 6 months ago and neglected to dust since then.  The walls were dirty and the shades that would divide a room were hanging lopsided.  They left the door open and cigarette smoke was coming in to our table and gnats were flying around my food! Yuck!!!!!  Onto food... I ordered pickle chips a cesar salad, and the filet, which came with seasonal vegetables, mashed potatoes and some sort of sauce.  The pickle chips were great! Thats all I can say good. The ceasar salad was canned cheese and store bought croutons on some wilted romaine.  The filet was not cut right. I am glad I got the sauce on the side. it was like milk and butter with some mushrooms floating in it,  The mashed potatoes sure tasted like they were instant and very grainy.  The seasonal vegetables were overcooked squash and some bits of broccili and bell peppers. This was not good either. I felt it was slightly upscale hospital food.    I would avoid the place.",

I checked the menu online, but it seems like they need to update because the in-house menu was different.   I had a Caesar salad with salmon. Pretty good meal, albeit not the largest I've ever had. It is listed as a side salad, which I was expecting the option of a full-size. The salmon was very good - cooked properly and seasoned correctly - had a slight sweetness which made me think it had touched a honey- or teriyaki- based glaze or pan.   Overall, not bad. I'd probably come back to try something else on the menu. Their salads are all based off the Firewater Salad - goat cheese, apples, and greens - and then add one or two other ingredients. So not a huge variety.",

    "text": "The dinner group ended up in the University area last night at Firewater.  The place used to be Lava Bistro and the inside of the place really hasn't changed much except for maybe a paint job.    There were 10 of us for dinner and we were assigned to the Lake Room was in the back of the restaurant with a view of, yes, you guessed it, the lake at University Place.    Anyway, the service here was exceptional.  Our waiter was spot on efficient and for one of the people at our table was great to recommend higher end vodkas.    It appeared that everyone at the table ordered a different entree and all of them had wonderful presentations.  I ordered the Black and Blue meatloaf which was a slightly over salted meatloaf with blue cheese sauce over roasted potatoes and topped with broccolini.   My two complaints here are the over salting as previous mentioned and the fact that the portion was a bit small.  Normally when you get meatloaf in the south, you get a good plateful.  But still the price was decent at $14.95.  For dessert we were given the options of a chocolate mousse torte, cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory, bread pudding, Kahlua creme brulee and maybe another choice.  I went with the cheesecake.  It was delicious but you can't go wrong with cheesecakes from the Cheesecake Factory........unless....when you get your bill you find out that the cheesecake here costs more than it does if you would buy it at the Cheesecake Factory.  For $9.95, I would have expected cheesecake of monstrous proportions but this was just an average sized piece.    So generally the food is excellent, the service is exceptional but the portion sizes are lacking and definitely stay away from the desserts.  I have never had a dessert cost me more than my glass of wine!",

We ordered an appetizer which took forever and when the waitress brought it, she told us our food was coming out right then as well. Only two of the four of us received our entrees when the appetizer came out. We ate the appetizer and proceeded to wait 10 minutes for the third entree. Then after we waited for the final entree (the burger), the waitress told us that the cook put cheese on the burger (we ordered no cheese) so the cook was redoing it. She comes back out 30 seconds later and says, \"never mind, it's ready!\"  They just scraped the cheese off leaving some on the burger.... so when we all finally got our food (because we are in the south and we wait until everyone has their food), most of it was cold. Other than that, the food tasted good.",

Nice decor, nice bar, nice outdoor seating but the food lacks creativity and most importantly lacks flavor. I ordered the Fire Grill side salad which was the best part of my meal. My main dish was the Mahi Mahi that was dry and had the strangest combinations of flavors. They didn't complement each other at all. Under seasoned dry fish with a sour taste to the vegetables. The waiter obviously didn't know the menu. I asked what the restaurant was known for and he said everything...and what he recommended was the Mahi. His recommendation was not the way to go. This was on the dinner menu, I noticed other reviews mentioning burgers. I wish I saw a burger on the menu. Or an Entree size salad would have been great. Oh well on to the next.",

Manager comes out and says the party in front of us came in an hour late bc of the rain and all the large seating areas are booked. Asks us to convene outside until they can figure it out. While we're moving 15+ people, graduate comes in; surprise ruined. Sat outside and ordered drinks for 30 mins... still no table. Manager says they'll setup cocktail tables and provide apps and champagne until they can sort it out. At around 915 - with no apps or champagne, I follow up with the manager. Told him we had a reservation and were the ones on time. I ask manager why not call us and give us a heads up that the resys are running behind. He says 30 mins wouldn't have made a difference. I told him it absolutely would have; we would have been able to make an earlier decision as to where to go. I told him we're all hungry - what's the ETA on the promised apps and champagne, he says it'll be awhile. Huh? I tell him, bad business - better communication would have been helpful. He shrugs his shoulders and says \"it happens\". Thanks for that. Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere. But surprise parties ruined; manager didn't care. Will never return. Oh and the sanitation  score was 92.",

The restaurant looks cozy and sleek when you walk in, but their food is not overly expensive. They have this 6 oz sirloin deal that comes with a salad and white cheddar mashed potatoes for only $14! what a steal! I went with the firewater salad as a starter, which was mixed greens, strawberries, pineapples, candied pecans, goat cheese and balsamic vinegarette. It was decent, but the pineapples were canned I believe. For my entree, I went with the healthier option of the Sesame Tuna, which was a sesame crusted rare tuna, which also came with a soy vinagerette, coconut rice, and sauteed vegetables. The dish was pretty darn tasty, although the coconut rice was very overpowering.  All in all, a decent meal, but not the greatest I've had.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed (and somewhat confused) by this place.  Let me start off by saying that the service we received was great. It was a Tuesday night, and while I didn't interact with the hostess, the bartender and our server were both very helpful. The bartender, for example. offered to give me a taste of the local IPA on draft, and the waiter was very attentive without being overbearing in any way.  But the food wasn't memorable, and for the prices they are charging, it should have been.  We ordered two appetizers: spring rolls and calamari. The spring rolls were perfect - light, crispy, and delicious. But there were only three of them, cut in half diagonally. For $7, it felt a little stingy.  But the calamari was easily the most confusing dish of the night. The breading was everything you could ask for, and although it was fried, it didn't taste greasy. So why use frozen squid that had the consistency of chewing gum? I don't get it. It's like being offered a golden, buttery grilled cheese sandwich, only to take a bite and discover that while the bread is perfectly toasted, the cheese is actually a store-brand version of Velveeta.  I say the calamari was confusing, but so was the main entree. I ordered the filet mignon, and I have to say the cook on the steak was amazing. It was easily one of the most beautiful steaks I've ever seen.  But it wasn't seasoned at all.  Again, I don't get it. Why would a chef who obviously knows what he or she is doing not use seasoning? If that steak had tasted like it had looked, I'd be praising FireWater to the ends of the earth. Instead, I'll never go back and I've warned my friends and co-workers not to try it.  I didn't care for the corn risotto at all, but in all fairness, that was a substitution, so I don't hold it against the restaurant.  But the other side - the loaded potato latke - was also unseasoned. The added ingredients helped make it edible, but the lack of seasoning really worked against it. I ended up eating all of it because I was hungry (the cheese added a little flavor, which was more than the bland steak could offer).  I thought the service was wonderful, and Joe (the owner?) could not have been more welcoming and gracious. But this was the worst seasoned, and yet bizarrely the best cooked food I've ever seen. Yes, presentation counts for a lot. But in the end, all that matters is how it tastes.  And other than the spring rolls, it didn't taste good at all.",

The ambience was nice, we elected to dine outside because the weather was cooperating so great. I love Bang Bang shrimp so I was immediately excited to see they had a version available on their appetizer menu called Banging Shrimp. The description states \"lightly breaded, sweet chili sauce\", simple enough, so I order it. When the appetizer arrived, the shrimp were a nice size and it was a good amount however, the shrimp were fried entirely too hard and the sweet chili was so non-existent, I cannot give you a True opinion on the flavor and how it measures up to the beloved Bang Bang shrimp. Before we could finish the shrimp, our entrees came. My entree was the Rajun Cajun, which is penne pasta, shrimp, chicken, peppers, onions and a spicy cajun cream sauce. As separate as I listed the ingredients is as separate as they tasted! The sauce was indeed spicy. I love spicy food and it was spicy to me! I asked my friend to taste it and he immediately broke out in a sweat. The peppers were very hard which almost made it seem as if they were slightly blanched ahead of time and thrown in as someone orders the entree. I never tasted or saw any onions. The chicken and shrimp were blah. I did have a small taste of the crab cakes my friend raved about and they were quite tasty. They appeared to have a lot of breader but really didn't. They were not completely Maryland style but definitely not a Carolina crab cake either. His entree came with mashed potatoes, they were bland, and he chose vegetable medley as his other side. It wasn't the best meal I have had but the ambience and the fact that it was my birthday kept me eating! I will think long and hard before I return, that is for sure!",

There was no soap at all in the bathroom which is a health violation since there are signs that staff must wash hands.

Probably will not order that again. Just okay.  So in summary, very nice looking restaurant with decent food.  Good for large parties as well.",

We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio to get started only to be told they were out of all Grigio in the whole place......who runs out of Pinot Grigio? We start to order something else when the Manager comes by with three bottles of Pinot Grigio apologizing saying the staff just didn't look hard enough. Granted none of the three bottles were the bottle we ordered but it was appreciated. So we ordered the crab cake appetizer, marginal flavor looked like pressed cat food. We go on to order the firewater chicken with the sauce on the side to share. When it arrived on the table we both looked at each other and commented this looks like school lunch. The chicken was so over cooked and so dry, the mashed potatoes still had the form of the round ice cream scoop... tasteless. The sauce tasted like glue. We actually started laughing it was so bad.  We should've taken the hint when we noticed hardly any customers in the restaurant. We mentioned how bad the entree was to our lovely waitress and she mentioned it to the manager who removed it from our bill, very polite service. (we only took one bite each) Never would I return without a complete overhaul of the menu and chef. Again great staff friendly service, terrible food.",

Salads, which were good, arrived at the same time as the appetizer. Mussels were only lukewarm, and rather chewy. Entrees arrived too quickly. Dirty dishes from the appetizer and salad course remained on the table far too long. Ribeye steak was mediocre at best, and only lukewarm.  Waiter was very nice, but monopolized the majority of our time spent there, not allowing us to eat in peace or have our own personal conversation.",

When my Mom asked for a refill of hot water, the server brought her water in a mug that clearly had a lipstick stains on it...the second mug she brought was just dirty.  The servers brought out fresh food on uncovered dishes, the drinking water also had a brown tint and the bathroom was so dark and tight that I could barely see the toilet.  Gave them 2 stars jut because I spoke with the owners about our experience and they apologized for the poor service.  Needless to say, we won't be going back again.",

Located on the lake, outdoor seating is a must if the weather permits.   Our server was super nice and patient as we waited for one member of our party who arrived super late.   We started with appetizers for the table: calamari and crab cakes.  Both were very tasty. The crab cake had very little filler which was a plus. Calamari is served with a nice aioli sauce that's like shrimp sauce with a bit of heat.   I chose the lobster ravioli. When my plate arrived, I thought I had been given the wrong dish. From the description in the menu, \"tomato cream sauce\", I expected a creamy sauce with a hint of tomato. My raviolis were covered in this thick, dark red sauce from a can! There was no hint of cream anywhere. It was not a good pairing with the sweet lobster inside. I ate two of the maybe six or seven on the dish. The server asked if I needed a box and didn't seem too concerned that I said \"no\" despite my plate being almost full.   We did have a southern peach martini. It was \"okay\". Great flavor but stingy on the alcohol. It almost tasted like a virgin version.",

No room to dance but the music was loud and changed the atmosphere. Would go back but not on a Friday night.",

The private room is spacious but doesn't have a door. The background noise from the restaurant made it difficult to hear the speaker. Our event included 25 people and we only had one waiter. It was a Friday night that was disappointing. He did the best he could but he never followed up with me after I received my meal. I ordered the black bean burger and it was really disappointing. The burger looked and tasted liked like a flavorless veggie burger with pieces of corn and black bean. Overall the experience left me feeling disappointed and hungary.",

Looks are deceiving. I ordered at the bar ( big mistake) and had a salad. When I paid the bill the bartender had the nerve to tell me that my tip was not enough! I left 20%. He said it was insulting that I didnt leave more because he only makes $2/hr. I got a refund when I complained to the manager. There was a group of four who turned around after seeing how I was treated. The bartender was either a prick or racist! Maybe both. The manager was understanding but appalled at his behavior. The best part? This guy only brought me a salad...he never took my order or waited on me!",

    "text": "So far I have been to this restaurant twice in the last couple of weeks, which were last Thursday for dinner and today for lunch. I decided to document each experience separately so that I do not confuse anyone.   On 9/27, I came for dinner with some friends from out of town who were staying at the Hilton. We were seated quickly and our waiter was charming. He gave some guidance regarding what menu items were most popular and raved about the tuna and the fact that they get it from water to restaurant in about two days as well as how yummy the sweet potato wedges were. It was the lamb burger that caught my eye on the menu, my friends ordered the salmon with coconut rice, as well as the shrimp tacos. We all loved our food. The only thing that was a bit of a downer was that they were out of sweet potato fries. My lamb burger was juicy, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked but it was so SMALL!  We did stay to have dessert and elected to go with the flourless chocolate cake and the creme brulee cheesecake which was suprisingly light and not overly sweet.   Today, I went for lunch with a group of ladies that I lunch with once a month.  Our waiter came over took our drink and food order and then went on about his day. The restaurant had a total of 8 customers in it and we made up 5 of the 8 customers. Our wait for food was WAY long and the waiter did not even come over to update us. So, we inquired about it and low and behold our food finally arrived. After inquiring about the tuna, which they were out of, Five of us ordered the lamb burger and  one ordered the fish tacos. The best part was that the sweet potato fries were back so we ordered them as our side dish with the burgers. The burger it was just as juicy and well seasoned as I remembered, but it was even SMALLER than I remembered last week. It was as if they took the burger used for the lamb sliders and put it on a regular bun. Ok, it was slightly more meat than that, but not by much!  Everyone enjoyed the taste of the burger, but all agreed that it could have been bigger.   FireWater has the bones to be a great place, but it seems like they are still working out all of the kinks of being a new restaurant.    Good: Food (\"beef\" up those lamb burgers!), outside seating, entertainment in evening Bad: fruit flies/gnats, slow service, service charge on bill (what is that???)",

What I didn't add to the Facebook page was that the manager said he would \"take care of us\", which I can only assume meant ignore us the entire time and do nothing for the bill and then take down my post off of Facebook later. YES they removed my comments later and reported me as spam. I definitely will not return. The food is not that great , nor was the service",

We went around Christmas and as soon as we were seated we were advised there were about 4 entrees they were out of. We asked for bread and were advised they were also out of bread. We have been two times after that and on both occasions were overcharged for the wine. The wine list stated $8 per glass, I had 2 glasses and my total was $18. We once again asked for bread and were advised this time that \"it comes with an entree but only by request\". This was a Saturday night about 7 PM and the restaurant was occupied by maybe 4 tables. The food was average at best. I did speak with the manager about this situation and his sarcastic response to me was \"Next time we will try to make it more perfect for you\"? Really? Read the other reviews here, and it seems other have experienced the same lackadaisical service we experienced. We will never visit this restaurant again and suggest anyone else refrain from going here. In today's economy one expects much better than fair to average service. We had a coupon, so I am assuming, Firewater was trying to recoup some money by overcharging. He did remove the extra $2 from our bill, it was not about the $2 but rather everything else we have experienced in our last 3 visits there. BUYER BEWARE!",

First, we had to seek out a host in the kitchen to get a table because there wasn't an employee in sight. Second, the wait time for drinks was ridiculous. Third, the restrooms were DISGUSTING and there wasn't any soap in the woman's restroom, so I wonder how the waitresses washed their hands. YUCK! The restrooms were so bad that we almost left just because of that, but before we could make up our minds our drinks had arrived. So we stayed and ordered food. It was pretty good, but definitely not worth the $20-$25 price tag for each entree.   At the current state of this restaurant, I would not suggest it to anyone.",

There was a horrible stench that smelled like sewer issues coming from the drains. Though my stomach was weak, I stayed. I sat in my booth and the table was  in need of repair; it was coming away from the wall creating an unstable table. The next surprise was the pricing of the food. It should note $$$ not $$. My friend and I opted for a late lunch pasta @ $15.95-salad was an extra $7.95-No bread was offered; not even cheese for the pasta. There wasn't even a sprig of parsley for garnish. The waitress was very pleasant but we had a miscommunication about red peppers when She asked if I wanted my Rajun Cajun prepared as is. I hate red peppers and she assured me there was only bell pepper (I assumed she meant green; she thought I meant hot) I understood. My friend and I traded dishes. We both enjoyed our food although the Pepsi was very \"off\". The experience could have been such a wonderful one except for the issues listed above. My friend went to see about the smell in the ladies room and was as put off as I was. She felt like it was an old musty mold smell. Upon leaving I noted a 92 health score on the wall as you leave. I normally draw the line at 95, being in food service myself. I hope the items are noted and corrected for the sake of the business. It just felt like complacency.",

    "text": "Okay, I'll open as always by saying that I am a culinary student with extremely high expectations for restaurant quality.  I've worked in restaurants from Uptown Charlotte, all the way to the Hollywood Brown Derby in Disney World. I'd like to think I know good food when I eat it.  Now, FireWater, yes. Overall I believe that FW is a great bar with a good atmosphere. I have been here several times and feel that I have had pretty consistent results.  The food is always good, the new Exec is creative and certainly talented, and the service staff is friendly even in the busiest of rushes. I've never had a problem with the way my food was prepared, and I've never had any issue with the staff. The only thing I dislike about the restaurant is that despite their label as \"American New\" there really isn't terribly much of a True theme. There is obvious Mediterranean influence, and then there are spots of French, Italian, Mexican, and Asian all over the place.  I understand that America is kind of this tossed salad of various different cultures but I feel that if they specialized just a little bit more and maybe cut ten percent of their menu, they'd be able to improve on the subtle shortcomings I've noticed in some of their dishes.  Overall, I think firewater is a great place to eat and have fun. They have a great location in a great area and I hope to see them succeed long into the future.  Fun fact: One of the owners is former Charlotte Checkers player and coach Shawn Wheeler.",

    "text": "This space has so much possibility.  They are in a great location, with a beautiful outdoor patio.  The interior of the restaurant has potential, but it needs some TLC.  Chipped paint and scuff marks on the walls.  The bar area is very nice and has the high ceilings,  some tasteful decor and a fresh coat of paint would really make me take this place seriously as an upscale dining choice.  However, a fresh coat of paint and cohesive, updated decor can not make up for the below par food.  The menu also needs some updating-again- identity crisis- what does Firewater want to be?  An upscale, overpriced version of Chili's, Applebee's, Fridays, or an excellent unique gem in University City?  I dined at Firewater on Friday.  The hostess who seated me acted as if she were doing me a favor and gave me a lot of attitude when I asked if I could be seated far away from the very large speaker on the patio. (there was apparently a private party later that night) My waitress was very personable, friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Ribeye Pork Chops and the grilled seasonal vegetables on the side.  The meal was bland, and nothing I couldn't make at home-better.  For dessert, I ordered the Creme Brulee.  This is by far one of my favorite desserts, but not at Firewater.  It was cold through and through, which means that the top, carmelized crust, the \"Brulee\" was actually done hours earlier and then just served cold.  I understand that each dessert cannot be made to order, but while 98% of the dessert is made in advance, the Brulee needs to be done right before serving.   I would go back for drinks on the patio, but one last comment on Firewater's ongoing identity crisis.  After 9, 10 pm on weekend nights, the bar area turns into a rather uninviting Ghetto nightclub?  Very strange/confusing- definitely cheapens the place and undermines any credibility as an upscale dining venue.",

The restaurant's atmosphere is sophisticated but, at the same time, almost homey, making Fire Water a very pleasant dining experience. Prices, too, are reasonable for the quality, and the service is unmatched.",
