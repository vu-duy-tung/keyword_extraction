It took us forever to be seated and after we were we had to wait 15 minutes for just drinks then we're ignored untill we decided to take our business elsewhere. On another note the salsa was also horrendous. It was very bland and thin. I will not be returning and I would advise people to eat elsewhere if you are looking for a good atmosphere and good food.",

The soft tacos are the best menu item I have had and you can get a pretty decent variety to choose from. The one downside is that one of the tacos I picked out, the chorizo, was absolutely horrible. After a couple bites I could tell something was off with the meat and let the waitress know. She knocked a few dollars off my tab which was nice but in all honesty I was just trying to help spare the next unfortunate soul who ordered this in case they needed to make some changes back in the kitchen. The second time I went there we ordered some chips and queso and the queso was served up in a tiny side cup which for the 3$ left you thinking \"really?\". I probably won't go back here unless I am absolutely stuck in Mint Hill and need a taco fix.",

Thankfully, the rude woman has been gone for about a year. But the current staff don't seem very well trained in how to wait tables -- you're lucky if they return one time before you get the tab. If it wasn't convenient & the food wasn't good, I'd never go back. The tip I leave is going to start to reflect the poor service. They don't even deserve 15%.

I ordered the large combination of tex mex fare.  The food came quickly and was hot.  Unfortunately the flavor was bland.  I was hoping it would be spicy with some heat.  The meat in each dish lacked spices, almost to the point of being plain hamburger in the burrito and tostada.  Even the chile poblano had no heat whatsoever.  The margaritas were excellent and reasonably priced.  The service was also excellent.  I will be going back and trying some of the more traditional Mexican fare.",

I was really excited to see a Mexican restaurant coming to this area.I have a few guys I work with that live in the Cornelius area that have eaten at that location and said good things about it,especially the Margaritas.We tried Taxco 12/24/12. The inside was done nicely to suit a Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were good not great. Unfortunatley the Margarita was on the bottom of the list with worst ever and we actually ordered top shelf. I ordered the Cesina as the menu description looked really good. The steak was honestly so thin there would have been no way to cook it and it not be completely dry and it lacked any taste at all. The plate came with rice, not much taste at all,re-fried beans,more soup like,and a small bowl of lettuce with only a few diced tomatoes and onions on top. It looked unappetising and tasted about the same. The service was so that they actually brought each one at the table their food seperately about 2 minutes apart on each.I really want to like this place as it is minutes from our house. I think I will give it another chance and try a more commonly ordered dish. As far as the Margaritas I would recommend passing on, even if they were free.I will review again if I re-visit.",

It was all good though because the order was exact.   My mister had the steak burrito and I had the fajita fundidas (isn't that fun to say?) and a half-order of guacamole. We were pleasantly surprised with random bonus salads and that chips and salsa were included with our carry-out. I agree with the other reviews though that the food is slightly bland. Despite that though, our meals were generally good, and the amount of food for the low price was great.",

I am not desperate to return and no new cravings developed from my visit.  I tried the shrimp fajitas and hubby ordered his usual beef tacos.    My meal came with a salad before the entree and it was basically just chopped up iceburg lettuce.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  I guess in theory it was a nice \"addition\" but they can keep their bag of lettuce...seriously. The fajitas were okay.  The black beans were dry and bland and I ordered a side of guacamole that tasted like water.  It was gross.    Everything else was just ok, as mentioned.  The salsa was okay, the service was decent and the food was basic/decent.  If in the area, it isn't a bad option for a quick bite of Mexican food.",

When finally acknowledged, was treated extremely rudely and informed to \"stand in line\". Another patron waiting for takeout then replied that he'd been there for over an hour. Again, the wait wasn't really the True issue, the rudeness of the staff was. When we informed them that we would cancel the order, the response was just \"okay\".

    "text": "After watching the last restaurant in this space (The Palmetto Grill) struggle for a while, and never really recover, I have vowed never to review a newly opened restaurant again.    Now that we have been here 4 or 5 times, I am happy to say that every time they get better.  Yes, the food was *yawn* in the beginning and the service was a bit...scattered, but they have come along nicely.  We still like Azteca's food much better, but for walking distance in Mint Hill, it's not bad.  The margaritas are excellent (which is another reason to walk), reasonably priced and frequently on special..in fact....they have drink specials most nights.The guacamole is fresh, but pretty boring.  (Perhaps once you have Azteca's guacamole made before your eyes at your table, you are ruined for life?).   You can order \"half orders\" of a lot of their appetizers, (the hot queso is excellent) which is a nice touch.  My favorite entree so far is the enchiladas with the mole sauce. Three Enchiladas, your choice....chicken, beef or cheese, topped with mole sauce and melted cheese. Served with rice and beans.  The rice is good..the beans...meh.  The partner likes the Chile Verde, big tender pieces of pork in what I understand to be some really good verde sauce. Service has gotten much better (much more friendly and efficient), chips are warm and fresh, salsa is ok.  HINT:  If you like spicy (as we do) ask your server for the \"Hot Salsa\" they keep hiding in the back (my guess is habanero), mix it with the house salsa and you are good to go!    If you are looking for something in the area, want to have a drink or two...maybe pick up a little Mexican... (food!) ...you won't be disappointed with Taxco.",

The service is great, friendly staff that are quick and constantly kept the refills coming. The location is ok, the decor is ok, everything is ok. Large portions, not too expensive, but the food tastes a little bland. Certainly not bad, but as Chad said, a bit lacking. Everything lacks flavor and tastes the same. That being said, it wasn't a bad experience. I suggest trying Taxco if you're in the Mint Hill area and want Mexican, but don't go out of your way for it.",

I thought the food was very flavorful and the restaurant looks clean enough. That said, the recent 95.0 sanitation rating leaves a little to be desired. Good lunch choice - particularly for the \"meat averse\".  While maybe not the most authentic or the absolute best Mexican you're ever going to find, the food is good and it's an excellent choice for lunch and an alternative that's sorely needed in Mint Hill. I really hope this restaurant works out where so many others have failed in the same space.",

The bottom of the bowl was filled with meat.  The remaining toppings were not sufficient for a large order!  It had a few slitters of lettuce, a few chopped tomatoes, a dash of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream.  I guess I remember why I've only been there once over the course of 3 years.  The nachos were $9.74!  Get this....they charge you 25 cents for a to go order!  I will not be eating here ever again...ever!!!!",

What I am used to is a big strip of skirt steak nicely charred grilled with a piece of cheese melted on top. The rice and beans tasted generic. Nothing like our previous visit. I even ordered a pina colada and it was horrible. I asked the waitress if the drink was made fresh, fresh pineapples at least. She said it is just a standard mix they use. Well now I know they don't make fresh fruity drinks at their bar. I get really bent out of shape when I spend $$$ on food that is not good. This was a very disappointing dining experience.",

They were NOT busy since apparently everyone was there the day before!!! Therefore, we had excellent service, a great pitcher of top-shelf margarita, and good food. Their salsa isn't really spicy, but still good, and I truly did like the fact that they bring a smaller basket of chips - unlike many restaurants that will load you up with them.  My husband had the grilled chicken salad and I had a 2 choice combination: 1 chorizo taco and a chile poblano with rice & beans.  Both of our dinners were very good, and we had a good time.  :D",

    "text": "Do not go here anymore! I live in the neighborhood and went to get to-go food and they have decided to change the prices on everything. I was charged  25 cents for each ITEM I ordered to-go as a fee This place had really gone down hill since Edgar left, and there are always young kids bartending who ignore customers and have their friends at the bar drinking. I'm sad to see what has happened to this place.",

    "text": "Mint hill location....  Great place to eat. The queso dip is awesome and the service is good. I gave 3 stars only because if they are busy, they do not handle it well AT ALL! It is like they don't know what to do!! Sorry you have business- deal with it! We went there one time when it was very busy (big party in the next room) and waited about 30-40 minutes for our food, then decided to leave (we have two boys, one is 13 months). They apologized but it was not sincere- maybe offer our meal for free -- to go??!! Just a thought. Learn to deal with heavy traffic- not my problem!  My advice is.., if they look busy- DO NOT go! If not, go and enjoy the queso and chimichanga! However- we have not been back since that incident...",

    "text": "Came to this place once when I recently moved to Mint Hill a year and a half ago. Coming from California I know what real Mexican food tastes like. The chips and salsa that were given to my husband and I seemed like they came straight out from a bag and the salsa from a jar. The food was dry and bland. Never came back to this place and never will.",
