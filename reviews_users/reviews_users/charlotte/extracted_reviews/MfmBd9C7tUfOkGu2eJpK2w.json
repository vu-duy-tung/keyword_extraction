    "text": "Today was my first time visiting Sunflower restaurant and the service was HORRIBLE. The food was good. Unfortunately, the customer service was terrible. Our waitress was amazing, but the hostess and cashier was rude, irritable, and unprofessional. Prior to being seated, the hostess rolled her eyes as we counted the number of people in our party. This type of body language will make anyone feel very uncomfortable and unwanted. After spending $50 & leaving our waitress a tip well over 20%, I purchased fried shrimp to-go and sat in the chairs in front of the register and waited for my order to be provided to me. The waitress walked by and told me that it would be ready in 10 minutes. I waited 15 minutes and politely asked the cashier if she could provide me with an estimated wait time for my order. She told me that it takes 10 minutes to be cooked. I told her that it had been 15 minutes & her exact response was \"Well we are busy and there is nothing that I can do about that. You'll have to wait.\" Which I didn't mind doing, but her attitude was unnecessary. She forcely pushed the kitchen door open, came back, & told me that it would be 2 minutes. Another 10 minutes goes by.. as I waited I watched the cashier process cash transactions without making eye contact nor smiling at customers. I also saw someone place my food on a shelf under the register area, but I didn't say anything. I waited for the cashier to notice. She finally noticed, with no smile, no apology for the delay she said \"You paid for this right?\" I responded yes ma'am with a smile and she practically threw the food in my hands. At that point, I did not want the food anymore so I asked for a refund. The cashier called the hostess over who just so happens to be her mom and her mom said, \"Well she paid for it so what's the problem? Go tell your dad.\" The waitress went in the kitchen, came back, & processed my refund. There was a party standing at the counter that complained of bad service as well, which is sad because I've heard so many good things about their restaurant. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't the same as others. Their first impressions made a lasting impression and I will never eat there again! Advice: Great customer service is the key to a thriving Organization. The cashier lacks proper customer service skills, but obviously is overworked & may need some help. Today might have just been a bad day, but regardless of the day you're having or how busy it is that shouldnt affect the way that you treat customers.",

Sunflower is like my home away from home on afternoons I am home alone and haven't eaten. The apple topped pancake will cuddle you right up. I am getting the spinach feta today. If you wants some.

One time the soup wasn't good and we complained to have it changed and then the owner came out to tell us it tasted fine to him. After that experience that had been our last time there. The staff is always been friendly and there's usually never a wait for food but after the few times I've having bad experiences we have decided to find closer and better establishments.",

Boy, we have been missing out!!!  I've always seen this place packed each time I have driven past it and always thought to myself that I'll go there one day.  The grits, egg whites, and turkey sausage are my favorite items from here as well as the fried apple sticks.  I prefer cooking my own grits as usually when I order them in a restaurant, I have to doctor them up.  Well... that's not the case with the grits from here!  I did not have to add anything to these grits, which is an A++ in my book (lol).    My husband and I are hooked and are fans of this place.  We have yet to try the other dishes, but we're completely sold on the breakfast.  The prices are very reasonable and the food portions are great, so you do get your money's worth (I can only speak for breakfast, that is).  We usually call ahead and place our order and it's always piping hot when we pick it up.  I have a list of favorite breakfast spots here in Charlotte, but this one is definitely in my top 3!!!",

I go to this place minimum once a week and feel negligent for not haven written them a good review sooner.  Everything I've gotten has been great. You're going to want to try those fried pork chops. The salads are big enough that it's a challenge to finish it. The soups ALWAYS taste home made, not just some junk out of a can. This place will give you the warm fuzzies of a home cooked meal. The service is always great. There's this beautiful little greek lady running the front end of the place that always remembers our names and our common orders. These people deserve your business for lunch/breakfast.   You won't be disappointed. It gets packed though around noon, (because it's so good, obviously) but the waitresses and cooks get people in and out quickly. Comfort food at its best. Healthy options, too. Enjoy!",

Pro: Kitchen from the view of the back door on the side seemed to be very clean. Large portions.  Cons:  Food is not good. It you like bland and unseasoned food this is your spot. They charge you for everything.  Parking is barely any.  Bathrooms are small.   Suggestions:  Change cooks.  Change locations or at least buy some more space for parking.  By all means get some tables that match the width and length of the patrons.",

The breakfast here wins me over. It is affordable, it is good eats and feels like home. They always over a daily special. Last visit, I had sausage patties, grits and 2 eggs and white toast for $3.99. They have a vast option of breakfast items and their omelets are pretty good. They aren't overcooked and come in many varieties. It must be a southern thing but if you want fish for breakfast, you can get it here too.   We recently tried their chicken fried steak and it was not so traditional but very delicious. It was well seasoned, juicy and crispy. The grits are always creamy and well cooked. Served plain so you can season any way you want, sweet or savory.   They are only open for breakfast and lunch. And depending on the time you go can be very busy. I was shocked at how busy they get. They have definitely have their stream of regulars. I mean the food is good.   Very easy to call in and pick up your food too. This is definitely a rotation in my family outings. My son loves this place.",

    "text": "First Time Visit today but definitely not going to be the last.  I've wanted to try this restaurant for a number or years but finally got around to trying it today.  Cool wet August for a change and not much else planned on the agenda.  Greek immigrants and their decedents play a major role in the Charlotte Dining scene.  For a long time, they would open either an Italian Restaurant or a Southern Style Restaurant based on the traditional comfort foods we grew up on.  This is one of the later.  Drove down to the restaurant which is in the Nevins area of Charlotte although normally listed as Derita.  It's a small building on the East Side of Statesville Road a little over mile North of the junction with I-85. Building is Red and White although I remember back when it was Green and Yellow.  You have to look carefully to find the restaurant because the Marquee out front is so faded, you can hardly make out the name of the restaurant.  We got there around 12:30 and it was packed. They are only open till 2:00 pm Monday thru Saturday and closed on Sunday.  They were extremely busy and we had to wait a couple of minutes for the hostess to set us but in that time, I had occasion to observe a very well run restaurant.  As soon as one table became open, they rushed on the table to clean and sanitize it and get it ready for the next table. They are also very well staffed and the servers are all well trained and experienced.  We were seated in a small booth and our server Missy was there shortly to take our drink order. I ordered unsweet tea with lemon and she volunteered that did not have lemon but offered an Arnold Palmer heavy on the tea part that worked fine.  The servers support each other and if my glass every got low, Missy or another server would check by to insure that we were fine.  The menu is very large and extensive and they serve breakfast all day till they close at 2PM.  I decided on one of the Saturday Specials which was Fried or Grilled Pork Chops with two sides.  I had the Chop Fried and Fried Okra and Apple Cobbler as my two sides.  My wife went with the Roast Beef with Mash Potatoes and Gravy and Apple Cobbler as her sides.  They also offered a choice of two soups and we both ordered the Vegetable Beef Soup.  The soup came out in a few minutes and it was great. Plenty of meat and perfectly cooked vegetables that had not been rendered to a mush.  Came out piping hot and was fresh.  I so inspired me that this evening I went to Publix and bought the ingredients to make a batch on my own tomorrow.  Lunch came out shortly thereafter and they do not skimp on portion sizes.  The Pork Chops were perfect. Nice and moist under a generous breading full of flavor. Not the least bit dry. The Okra was perfect and still a bit crispy and not overcooked as you find it in most places.  Not a big desert fan but the Apple Cobbler was outstanding.  My wife loved her Roast Beef and again portion sizes are amazing. Potatoes were great with a generous amount of gravy and she felt the same about the Cobbler.  By the time we left, she was already planning what she was going to order on our next trip.  Busy place but at the same time, great food and service and while a bit noisy, a very popular local place.  I'm with my wife and we will be back in the near future.",

When you pull up you can tell you are about to step back in time!  It's simple, cluttered with nostalgic touches and loud with the chatter of what you can tell are locals who would rather eat with the sunflower family rather than in their own kitchen but want the food to taste like it came from their kitchen.  SPOT ON!  While the exterior is nothing to write home about it does welcome you in with porch seating and a view of the busy road it sets on but I kinda like that.  :)  When you step in you can tell it is a family owned spot where they care more about how you feel and that you enjoy the food than that you ate or drank from an overpriced piece of pottery.  This is plain simple food folks at it best.  Anytime you see bologna on the menu you know its good simple food.    My hubby had the fried fish and grits meal with toast and I had the corned-beef hash (straight out of a can but I ain't mad at it) with eggs and grits.  They put a lil crisp on that canned hash and sat my over medium eggs on there with yellow stone grits and I was one happy camper.  One NOTE - do not salt your grits before tasting I made that mistake and they were almost too salty to eat since they come well seasoned already.    The place was bustling and I enjoyed every LOUD minute of it.  I wish I was a fly on the wall to hear all the wonderful stories being shared and made in this \"step back in time\" place.    When you want to keep it simple and good and fill up for less than $10 let the SunFlower family help you out.  :)",

My daughter and I between basketball games(New Life Fellowship, 1337 Samuel Street) right down the stree was looking for a close by breakfast spot.  Thus place had great reviews on Yelp, do we tried it. I am so glad we tried Sunflower Restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Farmers Omelet with hashbrowns and my daughter ordered the short stack with bacon. My server was very pleasant and attentive. My food was very tasty and served warm. My daughter said the bacon was a little greasy for her but the pancakes were good. It was served with warm syrup  I will definitely try Sunflower again and I will bring the rest of the family.",

Their burgers weren't as great as their home cooking entrees but they were still pretty good.

Yes, the parking lot is very tight.  Yes, there are rules to follow here.  For example, my lunch companion, Toni, arrived a few minutes before I did, but couldn't be seated prior to my arrival.  These are small prices to pay to dine in such a funky and good place.  Where else can you go with deer heads flanking the wall, alongside funny little relics and clever little signs?   For me, breakfast was the star of the show today. I had a veggie omelet with some turkey sausage.   They brought a heap of cheesy grits (delicious) and a basket of different kinds of toast.   I regret that I didn't try their apple sticks, but maybe that's a compelling reason for me to return.  It was very crowded and a bit loud, but somehow that added to the spunk of the joint.  The service was good and this is one of the more memorable places I have been in awhile.  My only suggestion is for them to stock Sweet and Low.  I don't like the yellow packets in my iced tea.   I never understand why restaurants won't just stock all the sweeteners.  It can't cost them a lot of extra coins, but would make a lot of patrons even happier.  Regardless, two thumbs up.  Go for both the food and the experience!  Tell the deer heads that I said hello.",

Came in for breakfast around 6:00am and found the place well lit and cheerful (but not too cheerful) and with a little effort we mananged a table for six. Fresh black coffee was quick to the table and kept hot and filled throught breakfast. Special was Eggs and Grits and biscuit with choice of bacon, sausage, livermush, or Spam so I went  with the Spam. A hot plate full of food arrived shortly: I generally prefer my spam medium-well with some crispied outside and hot inside but didn't think to ask (didnt think I had to, but it's the south...) Eggs up are easy wreck but these were delish: set whites with warm, soft, runny, yolks just begging for hot sauce and crumbled biscuit bits. Firm, creamy grits covered half my plate and didn't need any help, no salt, no pepper, no butter, just a fork. Fresh hot moist biscuits...",

The food was hot, homemade, and full of flavor (especially salt -- everything is seasoned very, very well). The portions are enormous, but don't think about splitting that meal -- It'll cost you. I enjoyed the Country Fried Chicken. The fried squash was more than passable, but was the one thing that could have used a little more seasoning. The mac and cheese was so creamy, but could have used more of a cheese flavor and less of a milk flavor. The pancakes are huge but delicious. The banana pudding is also fresh and right on the money in terms of what you would hope it would be like.   This is a tightly run family restaurant and they have their own ideas as to what hospitality is and what they will and will not allow.   1. Don't ask for plasticware or expect to eat something to-go inside the restaurant.  2. Don't ask or expect substitutions. You will have what they offer.  3. The management is usually inflexible when it comes to the rules they have established for their restaurant. 4. You must pay if you want to split that entree.   Now here is my rub... if you want to have all of these rules and guidelines in regards to your service, please place it on a sign and let people know right from the beginning. That way you will have less irritable customers and probably have happier servers too!",
