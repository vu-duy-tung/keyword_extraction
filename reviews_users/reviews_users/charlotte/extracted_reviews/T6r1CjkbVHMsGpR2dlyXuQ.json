    "text": "Coming from D.C. we weren't sure we were going to be able to find a sushi restaurant that would match our expectations.  We were blown away by Sushiya and feel so fortunate to have found it.  From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and attentive.  The interior is decorated beautifully, soft lighting, and although the dining area is open the noise level is low so we were able to have good conversation.  The overall feel is casual, but tasteful.  Onto the sushi.  We had Tuna and Octopus Nigiri, the Godzilla roll, Spicy Yellow Tail roll, their Halloween Specialty roll and the Rainbow roll (not pictured).  The presentation was beautiful and the taste was excellent.  If someone in your party is not a fan of sushi or if they are allergic to fish the menu is quite extensive and seems to have something that will please everyone.  We cannot wait to go back and I am looking forward to bringing out of town guests.  Thank you Sushiya for a delicious evening!",

A friendly wait staff and excellent Sushi Chef made for a most enjoyable and delicious dinner experience. I will definitely be visiting this wonderful restaurant again!",

There was a bit of a lunch rush but the service didn't suffer because of it which was awesome.  My only negative which many may be okay with was the extensive 'fried sushi roll' options... I just don't understand it but hey they have other options.  I had the sashimi bowl which was delicious and complete with a quail egg on top.  Yum!  My husband enjoyed his fancy roll(the name escapes me) but all around it was good and I would return.  Okay I lied, there is one other not so positive mention.... I ordered a lunch special which came with miso soup.  The miso soup was brought to me in a cup(which was fine... It was a lunch serving) but the cup wasn't even half full!  Did someone get hungry and help themselves to it on the way to table?!... Weird but overall tasty food.  I'll be back",

    "text": "Decided to venture out last night to find somewhere new for Sushi, as we have tried a ton of places over the past year, so last night was all about searching for a hidden gem so to speak.  As we embarked on our quest, we ended up near the Arboretum, and as we drove through the parking lot, we were amazed to find a whole new section of the shopping center that neither of us had even known existed.    We were shocked to see a row of restaurants representing all different cuisines from standard American fare like Chili's to Chinese (Cherry Blossom), quick Mexican (Qdoba), Asian (Malaya Kitchen), Breakfast (Le Peep), to many others...As we both mocked each other for not knowing about this \"bizarro Arboretum\", our eyes simultaneously came upon a Sushi restaurant called Sushiya, so we chalked it up to fate and decided to venture inside to give it a shot, as you shouldn't go against fate right???  As we entered the unassuming storefront, we were greeted with a huge welcome from the staff, a la Norm from Cheers, and the hostess/waitress said we could sit wherever we liked.  Not much in the way of ambiance, as there was a small Christmas tree at the front and a few assorted decorative pieces scattered about, but we weren't there for the decor, we were there for the sushi, so we didn't mind at all.  To put it mildly, the sushi menu is HUGE..about three pages worth of \"house rolls\" and \"specialty rolls\", and no pencil and paper was provided to mark selections, so it was a True test of our collective memories to keep track of all the various rolls we wanted to try, since we have nothing to note our choices on.  After multiple times through the extensive menu, we settled on a total of 6 rolls so we could try a little of everything.  Solid value on some of the specialty rolls by the way, as a lot of places these days price most of their specialty rolls in the $12-$25 range, but Sushiya had some creative rolls under 10 bucks, which was a definite plus.  The server was friendly throughout and did a nice job of making sure to ask if we wanted our waters refilled before they even got down to 1/2 full.   She was around just enough without being overly intrusive on our meal, and she was personable enough without being irritating if that makes any sense.  The sushi was fresh and overall I would say that 4 out of the 6 were hits while 2 were misses.  One of the misses was just devoid of flavor, while the other was overly drenched in a sweet mango sauce that was just too much in our opinion.  The hits were all solid but not spectacular.  I would say overall the sushi was better than what we found at Koishi, 18 Asian, Liu Liu, and other similar places, but a notch below some of the selections at Nikkos, Cowfish, NZ Cafe, etc.    Definitely solid and worth a trip to check out for yourself as this place to me would be the definition of a 3.5 star yelp selection, but I decided to round up to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3, because of the variety of options available from a specialty roll perspective.  Again, if you are looking for decor and ambiance, this probably isn't the right place to find those things, but if you are looking for a solid place to get sushi on a Saturday night that you can walk into at 7pm on a Saturday night, get a table of your choosing, and not spend triple digits for 6 specialty rolls, then definitely give it a shot.",

Only good thing we had from there was the gyoza (fried dumplings) and the customer service was very good. Oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross. Nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls. Really wanted to like this place but sadly never coming back :- (",

There's a TV screen that is constantly playing their specialty sushi which I thought was cool. The waiter was really nice, he gave us all samples of a salad. The miso soup I have to say was just okay since there was little to no tofu in mines =/ but it was really tasty.  I ordered the crazy crazy roll, mind you I don't really like fried sushi, but this one was delicious. I always eat my sushi with extra spicy mayo, but I have to say this didn't need it. My boyfriend had the Panthers roll and that too was spicy and delicious, It all tasted really fresh and was beyond good. It was all a bit pricey, but it was definitely worth it.  The only thing I'm sad about is that it's far from where I live. Regardless I will deff be returning here abs will possibly drag some friends here as well",

The spring roll was okay, it was small but but the sauce was good. Definitely not worth $6 for 2. The eel roll on the other hand was not as okay. It was small and there was hardly any eel in it, again, definitely not worth $6. My friend got the bojangles roll (we shouldve known it was bad in the first place) and it was absolutely terrible. The fried chicken with rice and avocado did not create a good taste at all. I ate 3 pieces and just got full from that. The only good thing i can say about the place is the service. We got our food to go, and the woman took us straight to the menus and and ordered in maybe 5 minutes. The food took 10-15 minutes to make, but it was expected. Overall, it was not a good experience, and im definitely not going back.",

I had no intention of eating at Sushi-Ya Japan, but I couldn't find the restaurant I had wanted to go to, and it was getting late, and I was getting very, very hungry.    On the night that I went here, it was pretty quiet.  There were about only three other customers.  I mention this because the service was really, really unprofessional.  No one was rude, mean or anything like that.  It was just that the wait staff appeared to be untrained, young family members of the owner.  They didn't know what to say, and didn't know how to interact with the customer (me).  One female server actually wore what appeared to be gym/running shorts!  This is fine if it's a Hooters, but I wasn't at Hooters.  When I was done with my meal, I had to flag down one of the servers, after waiting and waiting and waiting.  The four or five servers had all congregated around a cashier/POS system, and were all busy doing something that seemed like socializing.  They all seemed to be brothers and sisters perhaps, and I felt like I was intruding on a high school social group.    When someone finally brought me my bill, there was no \"thank you\" or any other acknowledgment.  I really don't like conversing with servers (I'm a pretty private, quiet person), but I do expect a professionally trained staff.  As for the food, the noodles were ok, and the sushi was dry and awful.  Never was offered a refill on the Coke. Tip to management:  hire professional wait staff, or train the ones you've got.",

My father and I got the bento boxes which were okay, but served shrimp sauce when I ordered the white rice, and my father got dumplings when he ordered the fried rice. I think they should switch that around. The bulgogi was really good, it was juicy and tender. The teriyaki salmon was sub-par. Not too bad but was a little dry for me. The only problem was that my family and I were seated in a booth near the back and were right underneath the music speaker. This may not be too bad but the music was very loud and they were rapping in Japanese (they weren't too good either) Everything but that was pretty good. Would recommend if you want sushi and not go too far.",

The food was spectacular, the Playboy roll was out of this world and was so good, my entire family has a new roll.  I am half Korean so when I ordered the spicy Bulgogi, the meat was not the normal cheap and fatty stringy meat you see at many Korean restaurants but were tender and chunky high quality beef with a great but not too spicy marinade that went far for taste yet was still very hearty and savory.  The vegetable Tempura appetizer was very crispy and not greasy with great flavor.  Again, the magic is the high quality of ingredients.  This is now our new favorite Japanese Restaurant.",

On another note; Bulgogi is not an easy dish to master and it's one of the best I've tasted. It's son the Providence side of the Arboretum so it's not easy to see unless your looking for it. Highly recommend it!",

Every piece of meat was flavorless, the shrimp looked like it was just soaked in butter and the vegetables were extremely bland. The rice tasted like it was something you would get from a instant rice package. Did not taste like hibachi at all. & for the price and portion, definitely not worth it. I've had better hibachi for $7 at Hanako in fort mill with triple the amount of food for half the price. Sushi might be good, but I don't eat sushi. Stay away from hibachi plates.",

The server was very friendly and not overbearing. It would've been better if she understood English a little better. The atmosphere was casual and not very busy although I think the rain kept folks inside. Overall, great experience and we will surely return!",

Our leader and her family order take out here quite often and she suggested we dine in while discussing our latest book.  Service was excellent! We were all served complimentary miso and ginger salads for a bit of a wait, and our rolls and food was beautiful as well as delicious.  I chose the Leaning Tower roll after deciding between several choices.  The menu at Sushiya is quite large. All the of the entrees were beautifully presented and several people got the Playboy Roll, mentioned as a favorite by other Yelpers.  The atmosphere is low key Asian with the focus on the Sushi Bar which includes a flat screen slide show of all of the specialty rolls.    What a gem for the Arboretum neighborhood!",

I was seated and served a complimentary salad. The salad was good, but overdressed..crazy overdressed. I ordered the onion soup and egg rolls. The onion soup was basically broth with a few onions, but no real onion flavor, which is what I was hoping for. As for the egg rolls, can I say frozen. Onto the sushi. I chose a roll based on the waitresses recommendation, however it had a mango sauce that was so overwhelming I sent it back. I was not offered anything else and was charged for the roll, $13.95, after eating only two pieces. I questioned the server about being charged and she expressed the fact she told me what I was getting and I ordered it. Whoa, was I surprised. I expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do. She disappeared and came out with an older women. Upon returning to my table she did remove the roll, but was very unpleasant about it.  Although I appreciate the fact they removed the roll, but was not impressed otherwise and will stick to my other favorites.",

It's surely changed since the 1980's when \"Tokyo's\" was the only Japanese restaurant available.   Having said all that, my hubby and I spontaneously bolted out late Friday night and landed here for the first time and we are so glad we did!  Huge selection and variety are found here, I must say! With many sushi rolls and sashimi from which to choose, you won't leave unhappy.   A favorite of mine now is the bento box that my hub ordered which has your choice of meat and includes the following: soup AND salad AND tempura AND rice! It's very tasty and generous.  I ordered the grilled chicken salad that was very flavorful, even though there was nothing but lettuce on the salad. I also ordered a sushi roll, so I was more than happy when finished.   Plus, it's nicely decorated, friendly and very neat and clean.   Last, but not least, the waitress was incredible and, as I mentioned, it was late but, her smile and service were as fresh as that awesome meal!",

Happened to go on a Tuesday night and 99cent hot sake carafe is dangerous. If you like sushi you must try this place.",

    "text": "I ordered online using their new delivery service. It's important to note I've never eaten here before other than this particular time. Based on my experience I would not order from here again. I ordered teriyaki chicken and mandu soup. The teriyaki chicken it's self was okay but I didn't like how the fried rice was cook. It had a weird orange color that I wasn't used to (tasted overcooked as well) and the vegetables had no flavor but was soaked in watery sauce. The good thing about it though was that I was able to drown it in shrimp sauce, which made me able to enjoy the food more. The mandu soup was the most disappointing part out of the meal. The dumplings tasted very soggy and old (I could tell because the dumplings had dark residue all around them). Also the soup was extremely salty. I had to add water to it to eat it. I gave this place two stars because 1. there isn't many places around here that deliver other than pizza  2. The chicken was okay and shrimp sauce was good. 3. food came around the time stated",

The service has been great and the restaurant is clean. I've had the panko appetizer, shrimp and vegetable tempura, Thai roll, crispy California roll, and the crispy Japanese bagel roll. Everything was on point and tasted fresh. The only small complaint is that the Thai roll was slightly overcooked on the second visit and looked a bit sloppy.       This is our new go-to sushi place since one-u bit the dust and Osaka doesn't have shrimp tempura (it's just shrimp coated in panko breadcrumbs).",

    "text": "On Friday June 9th 2017 at 7:00 PM my wife and 8 year old child with autism and high sensory problems among over issues and I came into your restaurant.  We sat down and after a waitress came over to clean our table that has served us many times left another waitress came over and told us we would have to leave because my son had McDonald's chicken nuggets with him.  They didn't allow outside food in their restaurant even though we have eaten many times before without issue. I then informed the waitress that my son had an extreme case of autism that he can only it just around 5 things and he throws up almost everyday because of his stomach problems she still made us leave. This is the only way we can ever eat out.  He is still in diapers because of his problems. Life is hard with a child and family that have these everyday problems. My wife and child went to the car. My wife was crying when I decided to come back in and inform the manager of how wrong they were for doing this to a family with a disabled child.  The manager asked the waitress if she was told by us that our child was disabled and she said yes. The waitress said to the manager you never told us that made a difference. The manager said each case is different.  The manager said we could come back in but my wife was crying.  Plus after being embarrassed in front of everyone and my child crying because his mother was crying we would just have to go back home. People who don't have children that suffer everyday can't understand how hard life is for parents to just simply go out and get something to eat. My son had been sick and throwing up for three straight days  and well one. He wanted to go get McDonald's since nuggets are the only thing besides pizza he will eat. I don't know how many normal young kids eat Japanese or sushi but it's your right I guess so you can try and sale your food. May want to revisit that policy. I wasn't wanting anything free. I just think after knowing you made that mistake. Embarrassing my wife and child and making them break down in a car. I would have thought you would have at least offered to come out and apologize to my wife and child. I just got a sorry. I just want you to know who it was that is leaving a bad review on your restaurant and why.  I don't want to hide behind a website.  I sent you an email so you would know who did this. If anyone has a child with similar disabilities and want to eat here make sure you call first and make sure your welcome. The whole restaurant watched us get told to leave without knowing why.  Being a human I wanted to explode but being a past Captain in law enforcement I knew I wouldn't be the right thing.  This place needs a heart.  And feelings maybe try and catch people at the door. I had the bag and drink in my hands. This was a very bad day for us anyway. My wife just wanted to be like normal people for 30 Minutes and eat and leave. After being such a great mom to a very sick boy she came home and ate cereal. My sons teeth have been destroyed by body acid he has been so sick in his life. But I guess it is more important to try and sale sushi to an 8 year old rather than let him eat what he can since he is 1% on his weight scale.  But hey, you said sorry inside.",

I personally had the beef bulgogi and got to try both the chicken and kalbi. Overall, the portions here are really BIG! Each bento box comes with miso soup, salad, California rolls, gyoza, AND tempura. It is definitely a lot of food compared to normal bento boxes. But the dinner portions are usually $15+ which is understandable for how much it comes with. The kalbi is $18.95 which can seem pricy but they cook the kalbi REALLY WELL and the flavor is really good. I almost ALWAYS order the BBQ Kalbi Bento Box whenever I come to Sushiya but decided $18.95 was too pricy for my lunch. Their lunch menu is reduced but does not include the kalbi which is why you are forced to order their dinner portion at $18.95 if you want kalbi for lunch.   The beef bulgogi bento box was pretty decent and tasty like what you would expect from any Korean bulgogi. The Chicken Katsu was also good and cooked well. The tempura is abundant and also really delicious (it comes with every bento box). One complaint I do have is the amount of miso soup they give you. It is very little (barely reaching half the bowl). The last time I was here they gave us more so maybe they were just having a shortage. Overall their food is delicious and the service is always good. Sometimes there is a longer wait for the food to come out but otherwise, I'd come here if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks for large portions.",

We did notice the time and asked about coming so late but the very nice waitress said it's no problem at all. I ordered just a dessert and my friend wanted sushi. I had no idea that this restaurant would have a great dessert but WOW I was very impressed. I ordered the creme puff with whip topping. I believe it has a different name but its AMAZING. The outer bread is soft and delicate while creme inside is very cool and sweet almost like icecream! It was light and perfect and I ate all of it! My friend ordered two rolls, one was the crazy crazy roll and the other an eel roll. The crazy crazy is absolutely a new favorite of mine even though I only had a few bites  The crazy crazy roll has a fried outer shell and shrimp inside among other delicious ingredients. Like I said, I had only a few bites of that roll but extremely impressed with the quality. The service was nearly perfect to match the food. Interior was slightly upscale and good enough for a first date. I'm giving 4 stars and not five only because they started blinking lights and moving furniture right before closing. However, over all, very impressed and I definitely recommend a visit!",

The atmosphere is quiet and very conducive to conversation.  The service was impeccable. I had the chicken and vegetable dish with the soba noodles.  It was really good.  It was preceded by the traditional Japanese salad with iceberg lettuce and ginger dressing.  The menu options were numerous and they had rice dishes, sushi dishes, and a lot of noodle dishes. I much prefer their format over the traditional Japanese steak house and all the theatrics!  This is low key and so very well done.  I usually don't go to the Arboretum much because I deplore the parking lot there.  This restaurant was not close to Wal-Mart, so it was a much easier in and out.  Not hard at all.  I had no idea that this restaurant was even there. Deanna wanted Japanese food today and I relied on Yelp to tell me where to go. As usual, YELP came through for me.  FIVE STARS!",

I got the udon soup with seafood. I was surprised at how large it was. It was filling and good. The only thing I noticed was that the broth was super thick, very similar to a sauce.

Sometimes it's spot on and tastes great but sometimes the sushi rolls aren't that fresh or it's mostly rice. Today I went in with a money mailer coupon that I had pulled up on the website. The moment I said I had a coupon the woman looked confused. Two servers didn't know what to do with it and one of them got on the phone. I was told that they couldn't except the coupon unless I had the mobile app, not the full website, or had the physical coupon because they need a code. I ended up leaving and going elsewhere.   Although this experience was not horrible, it doesn't seem worth it if they can't be consistent with the food and their promotions.",

    "text": "My first time here. My mom was Japanese. I'll see if they can hold a candle to my mom. At least they have a good health score!  Service is reasonable; the sushi chefs are businesslike but friendly and have fun messing with each other as I sat at the bar; food is pretty good.   Nigiri was absolutely fresh, almost melted in my mouth. You could bite right through it in three pieces if you wanted. Takoyaki was okay, almost not cooked in the middle but still reasonable. The taste reminded me of the ones my mom used to make.  Their bento box is plenty big enough for at least one meal for sure, probably two. Their Korean bulgogi was tender and tasty. Tea was lighter than typical for an Asian restaurant (tea bags not loose tea). Green tea ice cream was basic, but good after months of being cooped up inside from winter weather and rain!  I wanted comfort food and got a good dose of it. You need to come check them out when you're in the mood for good Asian cuisine.  All the chefs were good. Ask for Jesus, their Salvadorian sushi chef. He was very nice and accommodating, friendly, and kind and a very good sushi chef!  UPDATE: I went back seven months later to try their yakisoba, a basic Japanese noodle dish typically stir-fried with vegetables and meat of your choice. Usually pork, chicken, or seafood/shrimp. *I don't know what happened, but I was very disappointed. *Yakisoba is typically stir-fried with cabbage, onion, and maybe some thinly sliced carrot strips. Meat offerings typically include pork. Not here!  *I asked them to not put in the zucchini or broccoli and to please substitute shiitake mushrooms. You Japanese food connoisseurs know that shiitake is a staple in any Japanese restaurant if they do anything more than sushi. Not these guys! *They only use button mushrooms. They did not shred their carrots. And they used no cabbage. The cashier became offended when I explained about the shiitake. *They put some sort of sauce on the noodles, but the entire dish was rather tasteless, including the chicken.  *If you only want sushi or bento box stuff, Sushiya is good. If you're looking for something else, you might really want to consider going somewhere else.",

It also came with miso soup and ginger salad, along with the other sides in the Bento. The meat was delicious and there was a bunch of it as it didn't really had any bones except for one large one.

I ordered their lunch special on Katsu bento box, which included a salad (with the ginger sauce that I love so much!) and a miso soup (very small, but very good), and a super-generous selection of items...which even included fried dumplings (a True rarity with bento boxes).  Basically ALL this (just check out my pics) for just $12.xx!  Although I have a big appetite, I couldn't even finish them all....though they all tasted absolutely delicious.  BTW, I also appreciated the fact that their menu also included some Korean items, like Bulgogi entrees (even a Bulgogi Bento Box) and even a famous Korean drink, Soju!  Although they weren't crowded at all, they seemed fully staffed in the sushi station...and the waitress was quick and courteous (though she seemed to be in training), with the hot, freshly prepared food being delivered to the table within minutes!  The restaurant itself was fairly typical looking, and not as stylish and swanky as some \"hot spot\" Japanese restaurants in Charlotte, but the food more than made up for it.  Since I happen to do a lot of errands around The Arboretum area, I think I may have found a place I'll be revisiting time and time again.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and I am happy I did. The store front and decor are completely ordinary, but don't be put off by the lack ambiance. My waiter could not have been more pleasant and yet not overbearing at all. He greeted cheerfully and invited me to choose a table.  I received a complimentary salad of crispy fresh lettuce with ginger dressing. A tasty treat to start. I ordered a spicy yellow tail and spider roll which were both well made and tasty. The rice was done perfectly and the sauces complimented the rolls nicely.   The price was very reasonable. My lunch with salad and two rolls was $ 14.42.  I've been looking for good sushi in Charlotte and have not been able to find it too often. Today, I did. A definite keeper. I will be back!",

The house made ginger sauce on the salad is amazing as well!  Sometimes the service is a little... non existant.  Had to wait a while to get the check. They brought boxes and we waited about 15 minutes after that for the check. There were only 2 other customers in the restaurant.",

    "text": "I've never had sushi before, so when my friends recommended we go out for sushi on New Year's Eve, I was a bit apprehensive. Sushiya Japan is located in the Arboretum near the second entrance off Providence (the Qdoba/Chili's corner). I've seen it multiple times, but it never really registered to me.    When I entered the building, I was surprised at how nice it was. Hardwood floors and dimmed lights made it appear very upscale and trendy for being in the Arboretum. It was mostly empty except for two couples at side tables. Our drink orders were immediately taken and it only took a few minutes to get the drinks. We then ordered our food. I, and most of my friends, ordered the California Roll sushi. It was super affordable at $4.25 for eight rolls. The presentation was gorgeous and the service was ridiculously fast. Our waiter was so kind and constantly checked on our drinks and food. I found the sushi to be okay. I've never had sushi before and I'm not a huge fan of anything that is in the California Roll, so that's probably to be expected. My friends, who have had sushi before, both liked and hated the California Roll. The salads were delicious and several other foods that were ordered by my counterparts were really great (meat dishes). My final bill (for sweet tea with tons of free refills and the California Roll sushi, with tip included) was around $8.   Overall, the great service will have me going back to Sushiya (tonight, actually). I'll definitely try something different next time, but this place is pretty good for the price. Definitely a standout in comparison to the other eateries at the Arboretum.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service!! We  attempted to eat here, but left after they would not serve the onion soup instead of the miso soup with the combo.   Menu says  \"soup\", no particular type.   I asked what kind and was told miso only, onion would be additional 1.95.  Waitress said I could double rice, but no soup change.   This makes no sense - onion and miso soup are the same price on the menu.  Good luck getting/keeping customers with this rationale.  The place was empty when we got there and when we left. ...no wonder.   One star because  zero wasn't an option.",

    "text": "What a place. My wife and I came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky.   We showed up early as it was an early day all around for us. This place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back. Now for the long wait until next time.",
