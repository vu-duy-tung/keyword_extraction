Round 1, Question 2: How many different beers does a Flying Saucer U.F.O. club member need to drink to get a plate on the wall?  Round 1, Question 3: Who would you rather have guide you on which of the delicious libations you should try next than a friendly, knowledgeable gal in knee socks and a short skirt?  Answers: The Flying Saucer, 200, Nobody  The Saucer is routine stop for me, both for dinner and to just go have a beer and play some trivia. I couldn't, in good conscience, give it 5 stars because there are only a few things on the food menu that pique my interest (you MUST try the aforementioned beer cheese soup and the rocket tots!) and I have a thing against their pizza, though the slice my roommate ordered last week looked tastier than what I remember. Food is in the $5-$15 dollar range and beers run the scale from $5 on up.   Whether you are a lager lover, all about ale, or drool over dopplebock The Flying Saucer has many an option for you, so come on down and try one or two...hundred.",

    "text": "Having been to my first Flying Saucer via Houston I just had to see if Charlotte's location could meet or exceed that one.    I noticed the moment I walked in that the interior is acutally a little smaller but decorated almost identically.  Plates on the ceilings, booths along the wall and large sofa and chairs for lounging.  I really want to come back and just sit in those chairs and drink some cold beverages.  The food is a little better than bar food, although my girlfriend was a bit robbed when it comes to value of her roast beef sandwich she ordered.  Personally I love the rocket tots and the space club I got was delicious.  Now for the most important part the beer.  Yes, this place has tons of it and while I really wanted to take a run for getting my own plate on the wall, the location of this place is just too far from my house for me to really give it a go.",

    "text": "My advice - come here for the beer if you're in the University area, but skip the food.  Flying Saucer does have an amazing selection of beer, especially great beers on tap I'm not sure how many they have, but it's more than 30).  On certain days, you can pay $3-4 and get some sort of mystery beer.  What can I say - I love the mystery of it!  I got a Mexican Logger and thought it was pretty good.  Their menu has pretty standard bar-fare, with sandwiches, wings, and pizza.  Their pretzels were decent, but I had a River Rocket sandwich and was thoroughly unimpressed.  For the portion sizes and quality, their food is seriously overpriced.  One Sunday, my partner and I came in while he got an oil change.  It was probably a little before noon, and we came here because we thought breakfast places would be busy.  We intended to just get lunch, but lo and behold, we say people with plates and breakfast food on them.  Not knowing anything about it and asked the waitress, who did not tell us much except that apparently it is $11 if you are not a member.  It turns out this was a TERRIBLE idea.  So, I asked if they had coffee, which they did - SERVED IN A REGULAR BEER GLASS.  It was a very weird situation for us.  All the food on it was cold, it had only eggs, sausage, potatoes, and some muffins.  First off, it was GROSS.  Second, there was barely anything left on it and they were not refilling it (when we left, it was all gone).  It would have been nice for our waitress to tell us this before we ordered, but she looked like she could not be bothered.  I probably would have complained, but we decided instead to pay and leave.  It was a lesson learned to check the buffet before just blindly ordering.  Another family came in afterward for the buffet, which turns out had no food on it by that time.  I can't believe the waitress did not warn us of this before we ordered.  Because of this last experience, I don't think I'll ever go back.  I have no doubt Sunday afternoon is just a bad time to come, but this visit just completely soured me on the place.  They really have nothing here I can't get somewhere I like better.",

I've snacked here before but usually have a liquid dinner since there's so many beers on tap. I grabbed a Purple Haze, on special for $3 (woot woot!) and we ordered rocket tots for an app. The tots come filled with cheesy goodness and served with jalapeno sour cream for dipping - delicious and just a bit of kick! And with me being a sour cream fiend, that definitely helped my opinion on these.  I ordered a turkey burger with pepper jack cheese and a side salad. Both were quite tasty and the burger was nice and juicy. My friend order her burger with a side salad and received fries instead but the waitress came over to check on us and quickly corrected it. Great service here! The food was a bit slow, which wasnt a big deal since we had the time, but my friend Bryan mentioned it's good food but always tends to take a bit long to make it to the table.  Only thing downside about Flying Saucer is all the tables and booths are very close together. With it being busy last night, it was a bit of a maze weaving through it all to get to the bathroom. But other than that, great hang out, always a beer on special and our server was very knowledgeable and friendly!",

Great place for beer specials, to taste things you would not normally have the opportunity to taste and just hang out with friends and meet people.  In fact, met two of my closest friends there.  The food is better than 'typical' pub food but should not be your purpose for going to the saucer.  They have an outside deck which is great.   The bar maids are are for the most part really friendly and helpful.  They have great deals most of the days.  Glasses on Wednesdays, Tuesday they have $2.50 draft specials, new releases.  They have great guests there.  Got to meet and drink with the founder of Avery beers.  If you make it a habit, they will get to know you and you will be treated like family.",

The food is decent, and what you would expect from a place like this, burgers, sandwiches, apps, ect.  The atmosphere is awesome and you will not be disappointed.  They try and have different events at least once a month which is nice if you are a regular it keeps things interesting.  The staff is very kind and always knows exactly what my wife wants to eat and drink.  The one thing I am disappointed in is their \"health score\" and I hope they bring it up.",

Each time I've visited, the beer selection seems to have grown or something has been added that wasn't previously available to the human race.   The walls are lined with plaques from local Pro Beer Drinkers. You can register your beer-capades and work your way up to earning your own plaque. Sounds like grounds for a great DYL, am I right?!   I've enjoyed most every nook of this fountain-esque beer haven. Great outdoor seating, cozy inside seating and the bar is long and hospitable. Here's a tip: order the pretzel. Oh, man. I can't think of a better pairing of food/beer. Salty, warm, chewy, soft pretzel with melty, melty cheese. Throw in a tall German beer and it's like being 21 all over again. What a treat.   This is the premier establishment to grab a craft or import beer north of Uptown. Can be overrun with UNCC students and other beer fanatics. Sometimes difficult to find a table for large parties. Absolutely love this joint and always stop in for a quick brew if in the area! Cheers!",

The venue inside was just as I have remembered in Houston, with all the saucer decor. It was packed on a Saturday night. Thankfully, my friends and I managed to grab a table!  Service - out waitress was attentive and brought us out what we had asked. So she gets an A+  Selections - they have a whole bunch of beers in bottles and taps. I chose this place for their Linderman's Framboise -- which they ran out that day! Man, talk about my luck :( The waitress was kind enough to suggest other beers.. She missed the first one (didn't like the beer much), but got it on the second one (better suggestion).  Sorry, forgot what those beer names were.  Price - decently priced. At least they were not over $10 for a beer like other places. So this is definitely an establishment I would revisit someday.  Music - one live man guy playing the guitar was cool. Played various music of 90s, 00s, and etc.",

We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely friendly. Of course their beer list is extensive and has something for just about any beer lover. I like that they categorize their beers by styles. I hate searching and searching for a beer to try in an unorganized list. I ended up getting a sour and it was the perfect treat for the summertime heat! The bartender was also very gracious in allowing us to taste several beers we had never heard of and we chatted a bit about our favorites. My husband got the bahn mi for dinner and he said the pork was very dry, unfortunately he used my blue cheese from my wings to give it a little more pep. It has a really great atmosphere and I am thankful I don't live close to one, because we would be competitive in trying all the beers we could.",

The first time was with a large group, and the service was ok, but this past time, it was just downright terrible. A friend and I came in, were told to sit wherever we wanted, and then had to wait ten minutes before being finally served. The place was not packed, and the servers were not busy at all. One server even seemed to be so bored that she was standing in the corner massaging a customer's back. When we finally did order, we were served the wrong food and even got the wrong beer. When I brought this up to the server, the response was \"Oh, ya. I figured you didn't order that.\" Ok...then why did you bring it to me?  I will not be back.

There is a Flying Saucer in Raleigh that my friends and I would frequent in college, and this location makes me feel like I'm right back there. Located right of of N. Tryon right across from the UNCC campus, this Flying saucer has plenty indoor and outdoor seating. Parking is sometimes an issue, but if so you can always park in the golf course parking lot right next door.  I've recently had the grilled cheese and the cheese pizza. Honestly, anything I ever order food-wise is great. Actual quality bar food, and of course a plethora of beers on tap.",

Outdoor seating if you can find it. Servers are very nice. And can give good suggestions. The menu is many many pages.  And it seems they keep it well stocked. They also have beers on fire sale... meaning time to get rid of it so they can bring something new in! So many to try! Food is typical. Good but nothing to rave about.  Good portion sizes too.  They have trivia on Tuesday nights. It's challenging too. Very fun. Three rounds....   Throughout October they are doing different decades... so brush up before you go!",

We came here on Saturday evening, since we were in the University area. (I wish there was one walking distance to our apartment in Uptown!!!). We sat at one of the small semi-circle booths....these are cute cause we can sit side by side and watch football. There was a wheat beer on special so I immediately ordered that without even looking at who brewed it. It was delish so I drank that the rest of the night. My husband ordered various beers throughout the night. They have so many beers on tap! We are huge microbrewery fans and love to support local breweries....so we usually stick to the NC ones (Lonerider, Natty Greens, NODA, etc, etc, etc).   The food is basically German with some American dishes. We ordered the soft pretzals with beer cheese. We have ordered this many times in the past and new it was a winner. Dang those pretzals are awful for you but so good. The beer cheese is some of the best we ever tasted AND we recently went to Germany!   Spent the evening drinking beer, watching football, and playing darts. It was great! Service was spot on as well",

After eating at a TGI Fridays or the like I feel like I've done irreparable harm to my innards, but \"the Saucer\" offers veggie sandwiches, really decent pizzas, salads on top of the regular bar cuisine. My coworkers and I head out there every Tuesday for half-priced lunches and we're usually back on Friday nights to kick off the weekend. The saucer raises the bar on the \"cute girls and beer\" business model and usually attracts a very outgoing / easy-to-socialize with crowd.",

Service was great, Emily stopped by the table consistently to see if anything was needed.  When you ordered a beer despite how busy it was, it was on the table in a minute or two.  Had the Sheboygan Side-by-Side with fries instead of potato salad.  The fries were a little cold, but Emily quickly addressed the situation by bringing out hot fries making this a five star review.  If you like a a variety of beers, good brat's, and great service come to the Flying Saucer.",

This is a good locals spot for UNCC students, workers in the area and folks that live nearby (you get some walkers like myself).  The beer can be a bit pricey if you plan on having more than a couple (beers average about $4.00-$5.00 a pint) unless you go on a Monday, in which they have \"Damn Near All\" for $3.00 a pint.  The girls dress nice (for a guy like myself - Hey! I enjoy the atmosphere).  They usually wear some type of kilted dress and that gives the place some bonus points in my opinion.  The food here is pretty stellar too for a bar joint.  Bratwurst, pretzels and the spinach/artichoke dip is pretty of the chain here.  Overall, a good experience except for the pricing.  Beers are a bit steep but that's what you pay for when you want craft beer from across the world/country.  If you are a beer person, step right in.  This is the place to be!",

My boyfriend and his roommate are in the UFO club so they come here pretty often, from what I understand it's a pretty cool deal if you are local. There's a  $18 membership. After you try out about 200 varieties of beer you get a shirt, name of a plate with they will hang on the wall (or ceiling), free brunch every Sunday, discounted beers and a $100 bar credit.  The beer gets a little pricey, but it's not ridiculous. Yesterday we ordered the chicken strips and pretzels. The chicken strips and fries were good with ranch and ketchup sauces included. The pretzels were huge! The queso that came with them was not as impressive. Felt like theater style nacho cheese and not spicy at all.   Will be back... Maybe even join the UFO club when I'm local.",

They did not have my go-to, the \"Kick Ass Chicken Sandwich\" on the menu (so good!).. They did have burgers though which is something Raleigh does not have. Most of them sounded pretty good too. I ended up ordering the Saucer Dipster with fries & ranch for dipping. The sandwich was great! A heavy portion of tasty roast beef and the horseradish mayo was a nice touch. Perfect with the Au Jus! The fries left a bit to be desired though and the ranch was basically Hidden Valley, store bought.   I also ordered a local North Carolina flight of beers which was a cool menu option. Our waitress was great. She was really sweet and made sure we always had what we needed. I think they were having issues with the music though. It was really loud and scratchy sounding at times. I'm not talking like old people don't like \"loud\" restaurants either.. It was uncomfortably loud.  Just a quick tip.. I did not order them this time, but if the pretzels are the same as in Raleigh.. They are life changing with the queso and mustard! The mustard is spicy and a game changer.",

Everyone seemed to feel the need to be heard in their groups by getting above the white noise.   I sat across from my wife and could hear her fine without her screaming,  but then again,  we hadn't knocked back five beers either.   It's not a romantic spot,  it's a place to drink beer.

They have a great selection of beers on tap and bottles. On game day they have beer specials. They have  plates all over the wall. If you join and drink so many beers you get you name on a plate and it placed on the wall.  The food was pretty good. We just had wings and fries but still pretty good. Our server was friendly and I look forward to hanging out there again.",

The waitresses are very knowledgeable with the different styles of brew, and are more than happy to give you a sample pouring if you ask them. The food is good. There's some solid appetizer options like the large pretzels or the bacon wrapped jalapenos; it is a little pricey though. For the most part, the service is great, but I've had a few hiccups. This isn't anything extremely note worthy though. They have made a loyal      guest out of me.",

Came back Sunday night after the NASCAR race in Martinsville to watch the world series game 4, mets and royals.  You know by now that Jeff Gordon wins the NASCAR race and the royals win the world series.  Here's the rub: the door  clearly states the hours on Sunday - 12pm to 2 a.m.  I checked on the way in. I wanted to watch the world series if it was on or I would've gone elsewhere.  The Royals had a big top of the 12 inning running up 5 runs to make it 2-7 Royals.  When I turned back to the game from talking to the guy next to me the giant screen was black and they are closed, \"no were not turning it back on\".  Jerks.  It's the world series for Christ's sakes.  I go outside to my car and by the time I figure out how to find the game in my phone the score is 2-7 final.  They could have waited 5 minutes since the Mets rolled over in the bottom of the 12. Thanks I would have liked to see it.",

With a beer selection that appears to approach national debt numbers, it's pretty tough to not find a beer you are interested in. The food is so-so but really, who cares. Knock back a few of your favorites and that soft pretzel with cheese and mustard to dip it in tastes like a gourmet feast.

However, the wait staff and food is below average. An exception is made for the pretzel, but the cheese served with the pretzel was stale. The saucer pies (12 inch pizza) is among the worst I've had in Charlotte. The sauce had a bitter taste, and the ingredients used didn't taste fresh.   Our service was slow. Definitely could have been an off night for the wait staff. I'm skeptical though. I gave our waitress the benefit of the doubt until I repeatedly spotted her behind the bar chatting with co workers. Meanwhile she neglected refills, messed up food orders, and forgot drink orders.   If you are only interested in grabbing a few beers at a pub, then the flying saucer is the right spot. If you are looking for dinner and drinks, then you're better off spending your money elsewhere.",

I then had a salad and the tomato soup, both of which were good, but nothing to write home about.   The beer selection here looked good, and I loved the neighborhood feel of the place. They've got a beer club, where you can join and once you've had 250 beers you get a plate on the wall - which makes the wall full of quirky quotes and personalities of the many folks who've achieved this honor and is of course a great ploy to get folks to keep coming back.   Overall the food is average, but seems like a great spot for beers and I'd imagine the vibe and crowd is good on the weekends/evenings.",

Back in May, two of my friends from Ohio went to the 300 race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and had dinner here afterwards.  It's a nice place with good service and a somewhat whimsical menu.  Main selling point is their Saucer Club where you consume 200 different beers or ales and you get a Saucer with your name on it mounted on the walls or ceiling.  Considering the number of different bottled beers and ales and the broad selection on tap which changes weekly, not hard to have two hundred different one.  Food is a bit of an afterthough but what they do have is very good. I have the Reuben-esque, while my friends had a Saucer Dipster and the Chicken Sandwich. The Chicken Sandwich sound plain but with the bacon, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, etc, is anything but  Room is like an old pub with the exception of the several hundred Saucers on the Walls and Ceiling from those who have come before and have been sucessful",

For starters, this is just not a place for people of color to hang out. The staff seem hesitant to be helpful/accommodating and the only difference I can generally distinguish between myself and other patrons is the color of my skin. I hope this is not a universal experience for people of color, nonetheless, it quickly became apparent that my white counterparts were receiving a much higher quality service experience than myself.   Additionally, the quality of food and delivery time is just abysmal. On multiple occasions, I was served cold, not warm, but COLD food after a significant wait and requested a replacement, only to have a plate returned to my table with soggy and lukewarm food.   The one star I've provided is for the extensive beer list. Nonetheless, even the beer I was served appeared to be from the bottom of the barrel...",

The cheapest beer is $5 and there aren't many $5 options. The average price for their beers is $6-$7. A little steep IMO. They do have $3.50 domestic beers on Sundays and I *think* all beers are $3.50 on Mondays but I could be wrong about the latter. We ordered the pretzel-bratwurst board to share. That was more than enough food and good bang for your buck at $15. You get two pretzels, two brats, sauerkraut and bread with queso and mustard dips. They do allow dogs out on the patio, and the patio is really nice, as long as you aren't sitting right next to a party of 8 in their mid-fifties, totally drunk and openly flirting and getting touchy-feely with the servers. Not sure how they tolerate this behavior? Must be regulars, I guess. We will probably be back, but this might not be our go-to spot for beers and hangouts. Not at $6 beers... Ain't nobody got money for that.",

The bar was the place to be, apparently.  I waited for a while to get a seat at the bar so I wouldn't take up a table by myself (I hate when people do that).  Despite the completely full bar, the staff was on point.  I was quickly brought a food and beer menu, made aware of the specials going on, and was pleasantly left alone to go over the menu.  The bartender was really good at reading her customers, knowing when they needed something without asking and making everyone feel welcome.  The food was good, although the beer selection was much more impressive.  Between the value, customer service and liquid product, I would definitely make this a stopping point in the area.",

I am joyed the tomato soup Odell I got quite a few bits of those little rolled up tomato skins which was a little offputting but the flavor was quite good nice consistency the right balance of richness and tanginess The house green salad is a beautiful mix of really lovely cream is not just crunchy Romain or iceberg I'm not too much baby greens but really nice green leaf lettuce my complaint and it's kind of a big one the blue cheese dressing has a weird chemical taste and is quite off putting sort of meat you got hungry for the rest of my food.  It's too bad they don't make their own it's a very simple it makes such a difference plus cheaper to make them buy",

The saucer is a special place that is hard to fully appreciate by those who do not share a passion for enjoying beer other than bud light, however it is a great place for people who are willing to try something new and expand their beer horizons.  Be cautious when experimenting because they do carry some very expensive brews.

This place is aimed more at rich college students than beer aficionados. Some pluses and minuses: Food price and taste-4.5 Most everything I have had there is good and reasonable price. Beer quality and selection-4.6 Samples are available, huge amount of selection, beers served in appropriate glasses, don't think if I have ever gotten a \"funky\" beer (some places don't clean their draft systems), and fairly knowledgable on the beers. Beer prices-2.5 This is where the \"rich college kids\" comment comes in to play. They have specials, especially NC beer Sunday and pint nite Monday, which is about the only times I go. But the normal prices for most beers are .50 to $1.50 too much. Wine-2.0 I know it's a beer place, but sometimes people in your party don't like beer. The wine is overpriced, mediocre at best, and often has been open for days. Service- 4.0Most the staff are cute and helpful but there is the occasional terrible service night. Atmosphere- 3 Gets very loud at nights! Combine walls covered in plates with the customers and music volume knob constantly trying to overcome each other, and your throat will be sore the next day. No seriously! Drunk frat boys, noise, and on hot summer days it is 90 plus inside. Sunday afternoons and early evenings are best times to go to actually \"hear\" yourself taste the beer... The dark wood walls would be nice if it were not for the tacky plates. In summary, if you want to enjoy a good meal and a good beer plan to do it earlier in the day.",

Any place that has a wall full of beer taps is awesome and when it has a great selection and great service - it becomes my favorite. We had a trainee as our waitress (Leslie, I think her name was). She was great - I was surprised at how attentive the wait staff was considering the place was full. The girl who was training Leslie was equally attentive and pleasant. Hopefully the level of service is a norm and not a fluke.   The beer selection is great, although I would love to see more asian beers and couple German/Austrain ones like Lowenbrau, Hofbrau and Steigl on the list.  The place has a cool decor and comfy booths to sit in. It also has outdoor seating if you're one of those who likes to bake while they drink.  The food needs to get better but I will say that it is an innovative menu for a bar and their pretzels were awesome. I also had their beer soup in a bread bowl and that was great as well. The bread itself isn't spectacular but the soup was very tasty.  And on Wednesdays they do a keep the glass thing, where you can get the beer they have for that day with its own glass and keep the glass.   All in all, a good place to go for great beers served by efficient waitresses.",

And taps are placed every foot or so along the entire stretch.   Intrigued?  If not, don't attend.  One thing keeps the Saucer from being tops in Charlotte: the menu.  After having eaten here 3-4 times, the only edible I'd return for is the soft pretzels, (which are orgasmic after a couple brews.)  They offer stereotypical beer accoutrement like sausage and cheese.  But the fried foods lack in number for a bar-eatery.  And damn it, if I'm drinking beer I want more than one or two burgers to choose from.  The wait staff is knowledgeable enough to recommend a malty beverage for the less-than-beer-literate.  And pint-nights offer a bartender selected brew for under $3.  Which means that $3 can buy you anything from a summer swill to a Belgian Framboise brewed by monks in a slate tub, (worth more than $3.)  It's a beer-venture!",

Lots and lots of beer to choose from and if you have any questions about any of the beer someone will always be there to help you out. Very friendly staff and service is awesome. Food is great! Tasty and not greasy which is a nice change from typical bar food. This place has definitely opened the \"beer door\" for me. I've been trying lots of different beers that I don't think i would ever have done if not for discovering this place!",

    "text": "Beer aficionados rejoice!  If you're like me, you're sick and tired of going out for dinner and having 3-5 draft beers to choose from. I'm thrilled if I can pull a beer not slapped with a \"Lite\" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.  Walking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college - just much larger. And cleaner! Almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. It's cluttered but not oppressive, and again, it always feels clean and comfortable. There's a couched section up front for those really lazy days; elevated booths on the wall for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...  Bellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From this bastion of beervana, you can see the real reason you came here - the jaw-dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give some kind of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout. Any style you could ever want, well, it's here. It's impressive. It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. Saturday's \"Beer Poker\" is my favorite - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely not just the leftovers.   As for the food, well... It's decent. Let's be fair, I'm not coming here for their burgers. Food at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah - spicy cheesy pepper tater tots. You'll find something.   I guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely nice and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check in on the table frequently and always have a good recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends.  One last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. There's a reward every 50 - I just earned a free pint - and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't it?  So bottoms up, there's a lot to drink. As for me, I'm going to discuss with my Beer Goddess which brew is next on my list!",

So I came here for dinner and comradery and was pleasantly not severely disappointed.  Most bar food is wretched and disgusting with little selection and bad service.  But here the food was almost decent in quality and quite tasty with a wide selection and above mediocre service.  It's actually OK.  I wouldn't come here just for dinner, and it's terribly noisy so that having a conversation is basically impossible, but the patio is almost nice and the people here are friendly.  So I wouldn't refuse to go here again...but I won't recommend it either.",

Sooo not my thing! I have spent a LOT of time here, but no longer go for personal reasons that are not germaine to this review. How much time, you ask? 8 plates worth! (I was the number 2 8th time around...but I had my plates removed when I ceased to patronize their establishment. See also personal reasons not germaine, yadda yadda yadda) If you truly like beer, this is the place to go. The staff really knows their beer, so ask questions, sample and take direction!!! The pint specials are good, and the \"beer poker\" is worth it if you are adventurous and like a wide variety of styles of beer. As a suggestion, eat elsewhere first, or shortly after. I mean, how many chicken caesar rollups, wings and salads can you stomach? The one plus to the menu? They often undercook the burgers, which means this little Yankee got rare beef on a regular basis...which I crave but rarely find in NC. They also overcook a lot of other choices... so...it's a mixed bag food-wise. If the atmosphere wasn't so decidedly sex-sells-beer-to-men...I'd like it better. Sorta. maybe. But those personal issues still work there- I mean, exist. Without the emotional baggage, this is worth checking out if you are serious about beer.",

However since, they've banned smoking in restaurants a few years ago myself and some guys from work stopped by one night and I've been coming here about once a week since.  The pretzels are awesome, the brats are as well. Beer selection... well if they don't have something you like chances are you just don't like beer. Hell, even then they have a full bar not to mention beer drinks with flavors that most people who \"don't like beer\" wouldn't imagine to exist in beer. My wife (who isn't a big beer person) loves the hummingbird water which is a pear cider and raspberry lambic that tastes like a liquid jolly rancher.  The girls that work there really know their beer and usually make excellent recommendations. It can be a bit loud if it's busy so sometimes talking can be a challenge. The backroom is usually better in those situations. They've also renovated the back room so, it isn't so hard to get a table these days.",

It's much more than the thousand or so saucers on the walls and ceiling and almost as many taps behind the bar, although both are quite impressive. The best description I can pull off that contradicts itself is a classy, yet non-corporate atmosphere, with scantily-clad waitresses that remind you of anything but Hooters. The staff has a camaraderie with each other and they invite their patrons to join in, which can make for a playful evening.   The menu offerings are largely conventional, let it suffice to say you are not going to The Saucer for food. The big pretzel with cheese is always my standby when the draught flows more than anticipated. There are a few great options to keep you occupied throughout your visit: Join the U.F.O. club, try your hand at a dart competition, shoot a game of pool in the back, or relish the trivia and live music several nights a week.   It is imperative that I elaborate on the sheer multitude of taps that twinkle like stars behind the bar. They beckon you over to try the trendy name of the month, or the same old lover you've had for years. It's a steep price per pint, and I like to be well acquainted with what I'm drinking. A good option, if you're not an ale aficionado, is trying the beer sampler to see which flavors perk your interest.   You can't say you've toured the University area without a stop at The Saucer. Experience that \"certain something\" it has on the competition and let me know what you think!",

I'm bummed that I can not remember her name, however she was top-notch!  Answered all our questions with a smile, offered tastes for any sort of beer we were thinking about trying, and was always there when we needed her.  As far as food, I was most impressed with the cheese plate and the side salad.  The side salad was no leftover iceburg; I got some fresh spring mix and a few yummy toppings.

I guess they just could have come off differently.  The food is okay, the sausages were kind of bleh.  The nachos were really small.  The pretzel was pretty good, I'd recommend that.  Good place to hit up if you have never been.",

Traveling on business, the Flying Saucer is a good call for dinner and a real surprise for beer lovers.  The menu is dominated by sandwiches and burgers (in the $8-$9 range), but nothing really special.  I'd bring my wife back with me, but would leave the kids at home.  I'll be back for sure.  Follow up, a few months later.  I've actually been here twice since the first review.  The second time was pretty good, but I realized that the menu really doesn't offer much as far as 'real food' goes.  This last time was yesterday (Sun, 6/13) and the bartender was kind of an a-hole.  I think it was because I'm not a \"local\" as he was pretty condescending when I asked about the local beers.  I'll probably go back, but not for food and will avoid the brown haired putz pouring the beers.",

The only thing i can say about he Saucer is that they are on top of it.  The staff is as friendly as a bar staff should be even when customers are being somewhat suggestive and just down right gross.   The menu promotes some typical bar fare, some that's good some that not so good. I recommend the beer cheese soup that comes in the bread bowl. Its smooth and creamy with just enough of a bitter bite and spice that let's you know its made with the restaurants name sake.   You won't find a lot of pampas jerks in this bar like other places in the university which make for a pretty nice time for the non-fratty crowd young and older alike. Try the standard Monday night Pint Night or Trivia through out the week. You will not be let down.",

    "text": "The best place to get a beer in Charlotte, period. I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 \"pint nights\" where everything on the wall (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat ANYWHERE!  The glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn't offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great too. It's awesome to be able to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.  The food at the bar is, well, bar food. If you're expecting something amazing for dinner here then you're definitely here for the wrong reason. While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.  The one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable. The saving grace is that there is a great patio outside where you can go if cancer isn't your thing.  One final personal note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated.",

I mean they had a mean nachos but their variety of beer selections are off the wall.   So first stop after late lunch was here where we started off with dark beer which was pretty good. I forgot the name of it which means it did the job hahaha. When we arrived, this place was packed and I didn't want to wait so we just went to the bar and started with drinks. After couple of rounds, we thought it was a good idea to get some food so that beer can sync in.   We had a good bartender who provided drinks and food in timely manner however I kind of felt like she was really ignoring us and was busy gossiping with her coworkers who were serving the floor. None of us misbehaved so there no reason for us to ignore while giving more attention for gossiping. Granted they were busy but they had enough staff to take care of all of them.",

When you walk in you know they mean business in terms of beer. Taps on taps on taps.   This place can get busy so show up early and grab a good spot. If there are any types of games going on expect somewhat of a crowd to be there. The layout of the restaurant is pretty open so it can get a bit loud in there. There is a back room with separate tables that can also be rented out for certain situations.   Make sure to show up on Monday's. All drafts are 3 dollars.

Their inability to keep up with the volume on a night that should be typical for them is unreal to me.

    "text": "This place makes me wish I lived closer to Charlotte! Perhaps they will put one in Lake Norman...  Both my fiancee and I joined the UFO club.   My thoughts: if you are going to be here more than once, it is worth the $18 to join the club. Shoot, even if you will never be back, you get a cool t-shirt when you join. But, if you will be back, your goal is to try 250 different beers. You can only add 3 every time you go, so all you crazy binge drinkers are just going to need to make multiple trips like the rest of us! (I jest, but it is nice to know they discourage binge drinking) What do you get after 250 different beers? A saucer on the wall. The coolest part, you get to add a quote to your saucer. So, start planning now! The other perk of the club: you get free brunch every Sunday. It's a fairly nice spread which includes scrambled eggs, sausage links, ground beef, muffins, and tortillas to turn any or all of that into a breakfast burrito. Not at all bad for free!  The best part: The amount of beers on hand, at any given time, tops that of most other restaurants and tap rooms! You will easily accomplish 250 beers without having to settle for beer you would rather not drink.",

    "text": "The Flying Saucer is a cool spot in the sea-filled chain restaurant University area.  There is a HUGE beer menu, which is what the bar and restaurant is known for.  Certain days of the week there are different beers on special.  There is an inside and outside seating area.  If you keep walking back, there is another large seating area that you'd never know was even back there!  We had a work function there over the holidays and got to try a lot of different appetizers.  The pretzels were definitely my favorite!  The other thing I liked a lot on the menu was the chicken wings.  I just didn't love the portion size, but the actual wings and flavor were great.    If you want to skip the chain restaurants and don't mind girls in short skirts check it out.",

    "text": "Went there for the first time last Saturday. While the beer menu is impressive, being out of a couple of beers I wanted to try doesn't help. And our waitress, while cute and helpful, was new, so she needed our help in getting the right beers ordered.  We then ordered food. My GF's \"Rocket Tots\" were tasty, although she only got like... 14 of them for $6.99 so it wasn't a good value at all. I ordered a burger, which was the worst I've had since I moved to Charlotte in 2003. The meat had a sour, \"off\" taste, and the meat was cooked within an inch of its life. It was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid. What's more, I ordered it with Red Dragon cheese (and extra $1), and it was a depressing, congealed mass on top. The 9 fries that came with the meal were served at a less than ideal temp, but were nice and salty in spite of this.  The bottom line is that the waitresses are cute and in skimpy outfits, and the beer selection is good. But if you want to go here, eat somewhere else before you come. I'm also (literally) offended that the Flying Saucer charges 99 for their iPhone and Android apps... but that is neither here nor there.",

Had the chicken cheesesteak for me meal and it was pretty good, though the meat to bread ratio favored the bread.  As for Trivia - they run a tight ship and it's a blast!

    "text": "Holy crap! How have I not written a review for this place yet?! I'm here easily once a week! They have a great selection of beer and the wait staff is WONDERFUL. They're friendly and funny and if they have time, will usually sit down with you for a couple of minutes to talk and laugh. There are one or two waitresses ( the second may have left) who seem to favor certain groups over others and have given pretty lackluster service every time we have been. There's one in particular who seems to favor groups of guys over our group (probably because she thinks they'll tip better) which I think is a huge mistake on her part because I always tip 25-30% or more, even for just average service. When I went a few days ago, we had this waitress. We planned on getting three beers and some food but since she didn't seem interested in getting us drinks until we were out of beer, taking our food orders, or even just checking up on us in general, we sat there for two hours and only got two beers. If I had this experience my first time there, I never would have returned, but thankfully the other waitresses make up for it. They're wonderful company and always give really good recommendations for new beers.   Their food is delicious. Try the soft pretzels with warm cream cheese-chive dip. Or the spinach artichoke dip. Or the queso. Lauren's Goat Cheese Salad is terrific too, along with the sandwiches. The only food I have an issue with is the hummus. I'm not big on spicy hummus and  theirs has some spice mixed in that I just personally don't like. Someone else might though. Just a personal preference.  And I cannot say enough about the beer. I have had a Crem Brulee Stout. I have had a maple bacon beer. I have had beers that most people generally could not fathom. The lowest price on any beer is $3, but it's always worth it. They have a very wide selection and if you're a beer nerd, you should really consider joining their UFO club and becoming a Beer Knurd. After 200 beers, you get a plate on the wall with your name and as crazy of a quote as you can think of. It's really fun to stare at all the plates on the ceiling after a few beers too.   All in all, despite the tiny issues of the spicy hummus and the waitress that gives biased service, this place is still deserving of the 5 stars. Their trivia night is also always challenging, but very fun :-) Oh and they allow dogs on the patio so we bring ours every once in a while.",

I just wish it was a little closer to Uptown (where I roam).  It is located up near UNC-Charlotte where I dont think the college youth truly respect good beer.  They are drinking the natty ice and PBRs of the world while this place serves over 300 better options.  Just sad.  Seriously, when you walk in to this place you are figuratively smacked in the face with originality.  They do it all their way and you either love it or you don't.  I became a UFO member in about ummmmm 3 mins and 32 seconds.  $18 and you get a free Tshirt, membership card, and free brunch every Sunday 12pm-3pm for the rest of your life.  The brunch alone is worth it.  I went for beer on a Saturday and came back for brunch the next day.  The other perks are listed on the website and take a little time to accomplish.. Like try 200 different beers and get a $100 tab and your name forever enshrined on a plate on the wall.  I'm going for it!!   Don't care about joining the BeerKnurd club... Thats cool too.  Just go on in and try the pretzel.. Let me rephrase that... YOU HAVE TO TRY THE PRETZEL.. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and we are used to brick pretzels.  Though the sad thing is that we like them.  Here, you get two huge... soft... fluffy.. wonderful pretzels.  How can someone be so excited about a pretzel, you ask??  Just trust me and order it.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

Yes, some of the beers can get pricey, but there is nowhere else around that offers this combination of beer selection, atmosphere and service.  The beer selection is fabulous, there are so many great beers and many varieties.  It's a beer lover's paradise.  The atmosphere inside suits me.  It's dark, dark furniture, dark walls, covered with plates of course.  If you like a bright cheery clubish atmosphere, this isn't for you.    The food is pretty good.  It's a little different than your standard bar fare.  The rocket tots are really good, so are the pretzels and most of the sandwiches.    I've been here many times, and the service, IMO, has always been excellent.  Even when I've gone at peak times, these girls know how to handle it.  In my experience it's been very rare that I've had to flag down a server, they are almost always on top of their game here.  I definitely recommend this place if you are a beer fanatic.

We started with the two soft pretzels with queso and spicy mustard. Not a fan of the mustard at all, but the queso was decent. Anything with pretzel salt is delicious to me, but these pretzels made me question why i don't eat pretzels more often, they were soft and delicious. i also tried the buffalo chicken wrap and was pretty satisfied. It had good spice and i enjoyed that they threw in a little carrot/cucumber in there. (note to self reminder: sub ranch for blue cheese minus cilantro).    The main reason to come here if you haven't heard is for the beer. They have an extensive beer list that is tough to beat anywhere else. It looks like Monday is the best day to enjoy cheaper beer, $3 for most beers.  i enjoyed a few including Big Boss Aces & Ates, Sam Adams Winter, Foothills Seeing Double IPA, and my current favorite Olde Hickory Black Raven IPA. i opted to join the UFO club to begin the journey of getting my name on the wall or ceiling...If nothing else, i paid $18 for a t-shirt and a membership card. Fair enough.     We came with a group for a little unofficial Yelp event on trivia night and we won first place...no big deal.",

This place is 5 miles from my office and 5 miles from my house, no wonder I made it to 200 beers so easily!    The Flying Saucer literally has approximately 300 unique beers, with at least 100 on tap, and some of them are rotating beers.  Additionally, they have daily specials, like pint night with $3 pints and biggie beers for the price of a pint and even beer poker.  Their loyalty program is also rad, drink 200 unique beers and get a $100 tab on the house to have a party with your friends (I'm 421).  Fear not non-beer drinkers, they also have liquor drinks.    Their food menu is decent, I mean, it's bar food...The pretzels with queso dip are the best!  And the scenery, aka the waitresses, aren't bad to look at either...in their school girl uniforms.  They have pool tables in the back and good music streaming, unless a crappy band happens to be playing.  If a band is playing and there is a cover, Beer Knurd members get in for free.  Prost!",

Fun specials like 'beer poker' where you get bottled beer for cheap (waitress' choice) or local beers cheaper than usual on certain days. There is a gimmick for every day of the week, and they are actually interesting and make you want to come again another day of the week.  The waitresses are dressed as schoolgirls, but are highly beer-educated. They can suggest beers to you that maybe you wouldn't have tried before, and bring endless samples as well.  The food is good (Rocket Tots are great, the soft pretzels are phenomenal, the best I have ever had, and consistently)  Newly non-smoking (as are all NC places now) and friendly atmosphere.  A small complaint is it can be busy around 9pm or later as a band starts playing LOUDLY, so keep that in mind; also around lunch time during the weekend often people bring their babies (They bring a BABY to a BAR!) which is annoying if you like to say the F word or talk about your hot hole.",

    "text": "First let me disclose that I joined their beer club.... So, you know it must be good.  Still, despite my membership, I do not visit that much because it is always overcrowded and very hard if not impossible to get any seating during popular times ( Friday, Saturday, certain week nights).   Seating is a first come, first served basis so you really do have to fight to get a seat when one becomes available.  People are freaking aggressive!!  So, make sure you wear your running shoes and maybe a helmet.  The last two times I went I ended up leaving with out eating or getting a beer.  Once I had friends with me and after waiting 45 minutes, gave up on getting any seats.  The other time I went with my wife and my 18 year old cousin and we had to leave the premises because despite being a restaurant, if you are under 21, you must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.  Seems stupid since they ID and there is no way we would have let her drink anyway.  Bullshit aside, this is a fun place if you manage to get seated.  There is an immense selection of beers.  In fact, there is nearly anything you could possibly want.  I am craving a beer thinking about it!  The food is pretty good too!  I have had most everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all.  Aside from the beer, it is the atmosphere that sells the place.  Picture a cozy pub, sometimes with a live band, plates all over the walls and ceiling - mostly to do with the beer club,  hot young women in tight shirts and plaid skirts, etc..  The only thing I would improve is the building itself.  It should be 3x the size and maybe have an upstairs that is like a huge wraparound balcony so you can see and be part of all the action below.",

They don't serve liquor, but with the selection they do have, you are sure to find something that you will like. They have different specials on different days and usually have a couple beers on \"fire sale\" if you want to save a couple bucks. If you want to join their ufo club I believe it's free to join, and after you drink 200 different beers you get a plate party which gets you a $100 to spend on food and drinks, as well as your own plate on the wall.  Food is also served here in case you get a case of the munchies while imbibing, I recommend the soft pretzels! They have tvs on the walls usually on sports channels, as well as projector and big screen. They have darts as well, in case you get bored just sitting at the bar, and occasionally there is live music. It's near the UNCC campus, so expect to see college students here often. It can get loud inside when they're busy, especially since the walls are covered in plates.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the place is pretty clean.

I'm now just 16 away from my 6th plate, so I'm getting really excited about the approaching Plate Party!  Also, I had accidentally left my credit card in a check-booklet on my last visit and the Mgr w/whom I'd previously had the not so great encounter was actually very pleasant and got me my card on my next visit. So, mayhaps he was just having an off day when I had brought my concerns about not being correctly credited for my beers on multiple visits to his attention?  In any case, for the moment at least, this Saucer location has regained my affections! Hope they can keep the streak alive and I can proudly hang my plate by Oct!",

I went with the Saucer Burger which was a Blank Angus burger along with usual condiments, mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, red onion and then topped with Pepper Jack cheese. I added bacon as well because... well it's Bacon darn it! The burger was delicious and served with shoestring fries.  I really enjoyed it and the Purple Haze washed it down easily.   The service was great. I don't recall the name of our server however she was on the ball and answered all of our questions easily. Especially when we inquired about the saucers on the walls and what the various color differences indicated. I can say without hesitation if I lived in Charlotte I would be visiting here on a regular basis and I look forward to coming back in 2019.",

I find the service is always great and the servers very knowledgeable about the different beer styles. They also have food and I particularly like their San Miguel burger with a fried eggs and avocado. Another favorite of the food is the huge pretzels with mustard or cheese sauce.  So if you like the pub scene with great beer as the focal item and great food, stop by the saucer!",

I was not in the mood for coffee, especially because I wanted to sleep that night. I was very glad that I was able to open up my laptop (I travel with a Mifi so I can get Internet wherever I am) and worked at their bar.   To start, they have an EXCELLENT beer selection, both on tap and in bottles. My bartender allowed me to taste small portions of a few beers to help me decide which one I wanted a pint of. I was excited to try several local draft beers.  I started with a salad which was quite refreshing. I then went less wholesome and had the chicken tender basket. While listed under \"starters,\" it is a meal of itself. You get 3 large chicken tenders with a large portion of shoestring fries.",

We had all heard of it but none of us had been before.  All we knew was that it was a place for us to have a drink or two or three.  Who's counting.    My friends are beer connoisseurs or enthusiasts if you will.  I on the other hand am not.  I don't know the first thing about beer except that what I've had in the past I didn't like.  Fruity cocktails are more my speed.  So, I was thinking to myself great I'm going to have to sit here and watch my friends celebrate as I sip on a Sprite.  Woohoo!  Lo and behold there are mixed beer combos that are sweet.  Yay!!! Who knew.  Maybe you did but I sure didn't.    I had the Hummingbird H20 and it was yummy.  I then tried the Snakebite which wasn't as yummy but it wasn't terrible.  Our server was great and really knowledgeable about all of the drinks (the Snakebite wasn't her recommendation for me but I was being adventurous).  Which is quite impressive since there are hundreds to choose from.    Greatest part was that the drinks were cheap.  Only $5 a piece for my tall glasses of brew.  Definitely a great place to chill with good people and kick back a few.  There's also a full menu.  Always best to drink on a full stomach just something I learned over the years :-)",

    "text": "This is my first time to the Flying Saucer.  They have a lot of draft and bottled beers, a lot of locals and a lot of imports (from other parts of the world and US).  They have a large bar and lots of tables.  There are good decorations and a nice atmosphere for friends or small groups.  However!! I work in a restaurant that actually sticks to the health code!  That means no nail polish!  No dipping glass cups into the bucket of ice since little pieces of glass (or big pieces) can very easily chip off and get lost in the ice and only be found again when they scrape someone's throat.  For this same reason, glasses are not suppose to be stacked for any reason- the inside will get chipped and the spare glass can end up in someone's mouth.  Also, it can chip the outside of the glass which can cut someone's hand.  Lastly, bar fruit (aka limes, lemons, and oranges) are meant to be kept on ice and handled with tongs.  I saw the opposite of all these things at TFS.  The fruit was left on the counter and I even saw a customer reach his hand in from this side of the bar and grab an Orange slice.  I saw servers and bartenders doing the same thing.  The food tasted ok but based on their 92.0 sanitation score and what I saw going on front of house, I'm kind of worried to eat here again.",

The Saucer is a staple in University City and has the best beer selection in East Charlotte, hands down. Local brews? Check. Big-name crafts? Check. Imports galore? Check.

Food is pretty good, I go there more for the beer, so there's that.  I typically stick with the pretzels, they are phenomenal, get the regular queso, the cream cheese based dip will harden as it cools.

    "text": "Great idea, good menu, service is inconsistent, prices are slightly high for beer, average for food.  So there are different aspects of this place.  First off, the menu.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Hummus, spin-art dip, soft pretzels, tater tots, pizza, cheese plates, 2 veggie sammies, some salads and a Spicy Beer Cheese Soup that I wish I had tried.  So I definitely give credit to a place that tries to be veg-friendly.  I ordered the Hippie Burger (veggie patty).  It was OK.  But the thing was that it came with a side, and I asked the server if the potato salad had bacon in it.  She said no.  But the first bite had bacon in it.  So, I'll just say that I was very dissatisfied with that.  Whatever, I kept trucking.  And anyways, the real reason to go to this place is the beer.  I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.  This one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).  So take that 3 I gave it according to what you want out of this place.  Oh yeah, this place can be REALLY loud inside.  Like uncomfortably loud, so might want to grab seat outside if that bothers you.",

Bryan had a Seeing Double (I sipped it, delicious!) and Nikki had a Purple Haze, on special for $3.... What a deal!  The service was good, but a bit on the slower side. We placed our order for food and while I ordered a side salad in place of fries with my burger--- and it didn't arrive that way---it was quickly corrected! We had these Rocket Tots as an appetizer and the jalapeno sour cream they serve them with is perfect!!!  Really enjoyed those spicy tots! :). My burger was great, too and so was the salad.  Overall, a great place in the University area to come chill and have a pint-or three- and have some good bar food.",

As for the beer - I can't think of anywhere else you can go to find as many selections.  I'm not a huge beer drinker (check out my profile - Bacardi always makes my party :p ).  However, that being said, I've had some pretty damn good ones here!  On Monday it is $3 pint night and on Thursdays they feature a $3 beer.    On top of the good food and drink, Flying Saucer also does Trivia nights, DJ nights, and live music nights!    Not a huge fan of the servers in mini skirts but I have a feeling that may be a gender related bias :)",

Lots of dark wood lines the walls and the place is covered in saucers, some merely decorative and others representing those in the \"UFO Club\". There is an area for live music, and a couple of dart boards, I did not wander around or to take in the entire place, but I was told that there is an area with billiard tables as well. Really, it's a nice change from some of the Charlotte area drinking establishments that lack character and are littered with TV's...  The service was terrific. The waitresses are wearing school girl outfits, complete with tiny little plaid skirts, knee high argyle socks, and skin tight tank tops. Somewhat similar to the outfits worn by the Tilted Kilt girls. Quite appealing. Aside from thier appearance the wait staff seem to have at least a rudimentary knowledge of the beers on thier list.  The beer selection was outstanding, somewhere around 100 taps, and at least as many bottles covering a wide array of styles. If only they planned thier food menu as well.  The food was uninspired, and fairly plain. Fairly standard chain pub fare, and not terribly well executed at that. Not that the food was bad, just not terrific. And definately not worth the prices.  They do have some specials, I think they have a couple of days a week where drafts are $3, but overall I found the beer and food pricing to be a bit high.  Overall, I would definately go back. The atmosphere and the extensive draft list are alluring, even if the food is not.",

Where they raise the bar is with the uniqueness factor. It's hard to miss the hundreds of gold rimmed plate-plaques filling the walls floor to ceiling - and the ceiling! You can drink to your delight a pint-sized sampling of a couple hundred *different* beers to claim your own fame-plate on the wall. The contest doesn't stop there. Do the same thing 10 times over (yeah that's something like 2000 pints) and from what I understand you will have earned yourself a trip to some epic beer-bash in Colorado.

We had a relaxed lunch.  They serve good pizza and the queso dip was delicious. We had chicken pizza, and it's good. They have huge selection in beer. I am not a beer drinker but I can tell and my friend had a pint of good beer, and was impressed.  The place is big and very spacious.   Overall this place is awesome.",

    "text": "Flying Saucer is one of the first bars that I went to when I  started going to graduate school in Charlotte. It seems to draw a pretty solid college crowd mixed with some older beer drinking fanatics. The space is pretty large and has a huge bar and great outdoor space in the warmer months.   The selection of beer is great - every one is sure to find a beer they love or one they've been wanting to try!   Any time that I have gotten food here it is pretty standard bar food - burger and fries kind of stuff. My favorite is the pretzel appetizer! So for me, I would suggest going here for beer and maybe share a few appetizers more so than dinner or lunch.",

But I wound up meeting a friend for a few drinks and ordered some food.   Even though the place was jam-packed on this particular Thursday night, service was still very quick, and we weren't kept waiting long at any point.   Our server was overly-knowledgeable on the beers, and everything she had recommended was pretty spot on. And not like it was ever bad, but food was a little better than before.   Don't know if they were just having a good night, but they have totallllllyyyyy redeemed themselves in my opinion. And yes, I had to ask about the particular manager from my last encounter and found out she was no longer with them. Added bonus!",

Speaking of servers, the service is almost always spot on, which makes the experiences that much better.   Get the cheese fries, they're some of the best in town.",

A lot of my friends also love the place, so I'm either there with either a group of 4+, or just me and my roommate. Indoors they have lots of booths and tables, and outside on the patio there are wooden picnic tables. The waitresses are all very friendly and know their beer.   I usually just stick to the ciders and Hummingbird Water (raspberry framboise and pear cider) or mixed drinks, since I'm not a beer drinker. It's hard to resist their big soft pretzels, which comes with queso or other dipping sauces. Their pizza is also very good. I haven't tried much of their other food, but my friends say the saucer burger is amazing. They have the UFO club, where you can sign up and try to reach 200 different kinds of beers. (3 per night can be counted toward your total) My roommate signed up and has been working her way through. If you can reach 200, you get a plate with your name on the ceiling/walls. (The establishment is covered in plates, both the name plates and also just decorative plates.)  Some nights it's more crowded than others, but I don't think I've ever had a bad experience. It's a pretty reliable a good time.",

When you walk through these doors, you will see nothing but plates everywhere. You must ask yourself, what are all these for? Well my friend, these are trophies for those who come here very often and earn it.  Anyways, I came here several times and have been procrastinating on my writing. Thus, here it is: Beer that's unheard of / unknown + Incentive to drink = fun times. Now, they don't only just serve all types of beers but they also have appetizers and food that will accompany your taste in beer to fill you up in that part of your stomach (if the beer didn't fill you up already)  In the end, this place is definitely a place to hang out and just conversate (you'll notice a ton of college students during the school year as UNCC is not even 5 minutes away). Hours will fly by especially if you're curious on what type of beer is good and what isn't. The only problem here I find is that it is a little pricey, especially when you're a heavy drinker. Other than, have a beer or two and join the UFO club and get that plaque!",

I asked 3 waitress if they could take our drink order. One walked off, one looked at her watch and said something to the other  waitress. I pointed to our booth and went to sit down.

All the servers were beautiful, attentive, fast, and beer knowledgeable. The food is good but not great. Had the Hippie Burger which was supposed to have a jalapeno pesto. The burger was good but there was no taste of jalapeno at all which is what I was hoping for. The group I was with shared the pretzels (incredible spicy mustard) and the rocket tots. The pretzels were good but the tots were nothing to rave about. The next time I went had the beer and cheese soup and shared a pizza, which again both were good but not great. I would definitely come back again for the beer and service though.",

    "text": "I usually go here just to drink the $3.50 pints on Monday nights, but I occasionally come by during tap takeovers and other such events. There is always an enormous selection of craft beers as well as the mainstream national brands. There are always a plethora of options to choose from, no matter what type of beer drinker you are, novice or (perhaps self-described) expert. Particular attention is paid to local breweries, but beer comes in from across the country and beyond.  The food is almost always excellent. They have a charcuterie board that varies as market dictates, and their pretzels and bratwurst are delicious. Usually I end up ordering a side of fries, which are thin cut and crispy. I will mention that I did have one bad experience with fries where, when questioned, the waitress admitted they had run out and were using grocery store frozen fries. However, I got a full refund and apologies.  The atmosphere is nice, cozy, and interesting people are always milling about. Busy nights include the weekend as well as Monday nights, due to their wonderful $3.50 special, but it's still very easy to hear your friends and get your order in quickly when it's busy.  If you're from the area or live near another Flying Saucer, joining the UFO club is a must. If you get 200 unique check ins for beer bought at the Saucer, you get your name on a plate on the ceiling and a free party with free beer. Can't go wrong.  Parking can get congested on busy nights, but due to its strip mall location, there's always somewhere to park.",

When I first started going to Saucer a few years ago in college, I think it was under different management because the menu has changed. They took away my favorite item: the Hippie Hollow, which was an awesome vegetarian option with veggies and either ranch or jalepeno dressing in a pita served with a side (and I always got fries because they were amazing!). The past few times I've gone, I've been limited to the soft preztels, the hippie burger or a salad, none of which are much to write home about. The fries have also gone down hill as well. They are crunchy and flavorless whereas they used to be my favorite and on the level of hot McDonalds fries, but with some salt and pepper too. I'll still come to Saucer for beer and events, but I'd probably grab dinner somewhere else first now.",

In my pre-gluten-free life, I would have really enjoyed the extensive beer selection. They probably had 75-80 beers available. Saucers hung throughout the restaurant celebrate those who have successfully tasted 200 beers at Flying Saucer. OK. I might be off on the number. I think it was 200. I could be wrong.  Since I was unable to enjoy the wide selection of normal beer, I settled for the gluten-free Lakefront New Grist beer. Not bad. It's no Belgian white, but it wasn't bad at all.  The German plate with two brats was delicious. I love a good sauerkraut with a brat, and Flying Saucer definitely hit the mark on both.  More importantly, the wait staff was great. I got to the restaurant about 20 minutes before the rest of my party. The waitress Lauren was more than happy to chat for a couple of minutes while I waited.",

    "text": "They have awesome food! That I will say. They also hold brunch, which then they serve breakfast beers which I never thought existed? Their burgers are great, their hummus is fresh, and their grilled cheese and tomato soup is awesome!  My friends and I go here every Monday night and it never ceases to please. Good food, good atmosphere, it's a great place to chill and get a beer or drink. I'm not one for beer, so I usually get a Lambic Framboise, hard cider, or a vodka tonic. I will say don't go to them if you want a good cocktail, it's not their specialty so it won't be as good.  They also hold events there throughout the year celebrating numerous things, so it's always nice to go and see who's there.",

    "text": "Stopped in before a show at PNC Music Pavilion for an indoor tailgate. Beer selection is outstanding - some craft beer joints go for quality and not quantity. Others focus a little too much on local brews. This place has the perfect combo of both. Well thought variety from around the world. And who would have thought the food was good, too?!? The wife had a turkey burger and said it was the best she ever had. She prompted me to write this review. I had a turkey sandwich that was extremely delicious, as well. Bartender was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Glad I don't live closer. I would give them a lot of my hard-earned $$. Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "This is a cool spot to come before shows at the Charlotte amphitheater, as it is close and has just what you need if you aren't prepped for a long tailgate.   They have a HUGE beer selection.. and apparently if you try all 200 of their beers, you get a gold plate with your name on it on the wall. Granted... this achievement would take some time... but hey, who doesn't like a challenge?   I had one of their Cottonwood pumpkins and it was delicious. I highly recommend that if you like beers of the fall/pumpkin variety.   Our party of 6 shared an array of appetizers that spanned from brat corndogs to pizza to bacon-wrapped jalapenos, in addition to an assortment of dips and such. All were pretty good and did the trick.   All in all, a good stop before a fun show.",
