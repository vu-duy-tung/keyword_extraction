They make falafel on pita/salad/rice and its tah-die-for!  I cant even count on all my fingers and toes how many times (ok super late nights) my guy and I have dragged our not so sober selves to stand in the what will seem at first to be the longest line that isn't even really a line because drunk people were in charge of forming it so its a complete circus but somehow someway they guide you in take your order and off you go to enjoy your halal cart magic that will simultaneously delight and surprise and leave you wanting more and have no fear my non adult beverage indulging friends I have also had this on a few sober occasions as well and I can soberly attest to it on those days too.  I have also enjoyed the chicken dishes and my guy has raved about the gyros and phillys they offer also. This place radiates flavorful scents better than fast food joints so if you don't believe me just walk by one night on your next trip uptown and check it out for yourself and don't let the \"line\" scare you away from this little gem.",

    "text": "Eat at your own risk.  I was excited to see this cart in the university area.  Passed it many times and always wanted to stop there.  Finally did.  Based on the reviews I was excited to get home and see what the fuss was.  Ordered Gyro, Chicken and Lamb Combo, and the falafel salad.  I opened the chicken and Lamb first and didn't see anything mind blowing but had high hopes on the taste.  Excited to see the rest I opened up the falafel salad.  The salad looks to be made with green leaf lettuce mix but then I noticed black marks all over the salad.  I thought maybe they sauteed the salad and thought maybe some of it was charred however that was was not the case.  Upon closer inspection... I noticed that the leaves were brown/black and rotted/spoiled.  It was an appalling sight.  I had to take it back within minutes of getting it home.  I thought maybe there might be some understanding with the establishment but I was wrong.  I got back and showed the salad to the gentleman who took my order/money.  I told him it was rotted/spoiled salad and he had a shocked look when he saw it.  I also asked him if he would eat it and he didn't have a response except scramble to refund me.  Lucky me, the owner was there and the gentleman giving my refund pointed him to me.  I asked to speak to him and the owner came out and said the salad was fine.  He also then claimed that it was balsamic vinegar dressing.  I love balsamic vinegar salads and salads in general so I  have had my fair share of salads.  Ive also made many salads and have handled all types of lettuce/produce and I know what fresh salads/greens look like.  I also know what spoiled/rotting lettuce/produce looks like.  All the black and brown edges and spots were slimy and horribly wilted.  Not to mention the rotted leaves were slimy and quickly fell apart when gently rubbed between the fingers and I mean I did it gently.  Long story short, the owner claimed that his lettuce leaf was predressed with balsamic vinegar.  He then pulled out what looked to be a bulk bag/maybe 10+lbs of lettuce and there was brown juice all over with many leaves that looked horrible.  I could not believe my eyes and his bold claim that it was prepackaged balsamic vinegar salad.  He also said he could open it and allow me to taste it.  The funny thing is when I asked them if they would eat what they served me no one responded.  Maybe I'm clueless but of all the prepackaged salads I've bought, I've never once seen salads that have been predressed in the bag already.  Normally, any supplied dressing comes in a package packed in separately with the greens.  Why would the owner state this when it's a cardinal sin to have/serve soggy salad??  To think that a company would prepackage salad greens that have already been dressed in dressing that could be sitting for days/weeks and then be ok to be served is beyond my little brain.  That said, I would love to see this owner tell food services/the health department what he told me and let them confirm.  This is the first and last time I will visit this establishment.  To those that do... good luck and hopefully you don't order the \"predressed\" balsamic greens that are rotted/spoiled.  I can not believe this was the exchange/excuse provided from the owner.  I could see a worker but the Owner???  This lack of care/concern is quite disappointing and is clearly reflected in the food that they are willing to put out.  Sadly disappointed as i really wanted to support this establishment because I love this type of food!",

But the smell hits you first, as with all good Halal carts, and when I saw it I immediately pulled over, parked my bike and made an order. The chicken with rice is outstanding, as is the falafel, pita, all of it. All are authentic, flavorful, fresh tasting and well executed. I've been back here several times and could probably eat here every day. Plus, the prices are very cheap -- seven bucks gets you a great meal. Highly recommended!",

He told me he would take my order & pointed me to the nearest ATM which was a min away from the cart (they are brilliant with this location). I paid them & within minutes they had my food ready.   When I got home I felt like a kid with candy. I opened it & fell in love instantly with the food. I wish they had delivery because I would order more right now so I can eat it all day lol!!!

There's a little bit of lettuce that's always on the side, it makes me feel like I'm being a little bit healthy by eating it, but the meat and rice take over the entire meal.

The lamb and chicken over rice is delicious. The gyro and chicken pitas are amazing as well.  Make sure you try the yogurt sauce and the hot sauce they offer. They're usually pretty busy during lunch hours, but it's worth the wait. Only negative is they only accept cash.",

I had their gyro, lamb & chicken combo, & the next morning before heading to the airport I NEEDED another!! Sadly, I now live in the DC area, & I'm craving one now but nothing comes close here!!

It's a few blocks from SpringHill Suites. We ordered a burger, philly cheese steak, and wings with fries and onion rings. The burger and cheesesteak helped fend off the hunger and were not horrible, but definitely could use some tweaking. The wings were delicious. The guys running this cart are super friendly and happy to help you. I felt bad for them because in waiting for our food, we observed a lot of people being jerks towards them. They handled it with class. Always smiling. We will definitely hit this truck up again when we have those midnight cravings while downtown.",

Now that I am closer to Uptown, I come here at least once a week for their chicken and lamb combo over rice.  Here are the downsides...the small \"salad\" that typically comes with each combo is way too little to counterbalance the piles of savory protein they stack on top of your rice. Secondly, good luck with parking. Thirdly, CASH ONLY.  Now the good news is that they have a sister restaurant around Matthews that accepts credit cards, has unlimited parking, and offers huge ass portions for under 7 bucks!",

It's just so damn good. The seasoning is always on point, the meats are super tender and the rice is well cooked. The portion size is super generous too given that most dishes are only $6.

I went with the traditional combo, lamb and chicken over rice and wasn't sure what to expect having eaten my fair share of halal carts in NYC.  I quickly took this delight back to my room as the area was a little sketch and devoured my meal.  The combo was honestly better than most of the ones I've had in NYC if not better, watch out halal guys. The meat was finely chopped and well seasoned over nicely cooked basmati rice.  And the kicker was the white sauce, not sure what was on there but wow the flavor was on point, well balanced and perfect compliment to the dish, just wish I had more!  Bravo!",

I ordered the Chicken plate and the husband ordered the Chicken and Lamb combo. So much food for $12!!! We asked for the hot sauce on the side and I'm so glad we did. It has quite a kick (and I love spicy food). The white sauce they use is delicious, the guys working were super friendly, and we waited for our hot, fresh food for about 5 minutes.   Life is good with this Halal Cart in my life.",

The food is simple and delicious.  The portions are generous enough.  The menu isn't diverse but what they offer they are excellent at.  I usually go for lamb and rice or the gyro.  The food is on the fatty side but I just can't get enough of it.  There is a bit of a wait, even during the sub freezing temperatures of late.  If you are in uptown this is a must stop location.  This attraction serves better food that the satellite location near UNC Charlotte.  My favorite is the lamb over rice, I am thinking about having them just put the lamb over lettuce instead.  The lamb over rice isn't a rice version of the lamb salad, but it shares a lot of flavors with the lamb gyro.  My second favorite is the lamb gyro, and this item also satisfies people who can't stand any spice (lamb over rice is a dish best served spicy).  I had the Philly cheese-steak because I wanted a point of comparison for other establishments.  The cheese-steak is alright but suffers from being smaller than the lamb over rice and costing just as much.  I also had a problem where the cheese was stuck to the wrapper and I lost some of it as a result.  See the picture.",

The first thing that gets you is the delicious smell from at least a block away. I got the Chicken/Lamb combo: $6 gets you a big scoop of chicken, big scoop of Lamb, two big scoops of rice, lettuce, tomato, a tangy/creamy white sauce, and hot sauce. There was at least a 1/2lb of rice! Food was perfectly seasoned, rice, Lamb, and chicken was cooked great! I went light with the hot sauce this first time but next time I'll go how it comes, the sauce has a lot of flavor and isn't just 'in your face' spicy. Outstanding value and flavor, I'll definitely be back for more!   Notice: Cash only, but the prices on the menu is the final price, tax included in price!",

You roll the dice anytime to visit a new cart in NYC  Convenience: (6/5) Went here on a Sunday night at 10:30pm! I hard to find decent food at this time  Value: (4.5/5) The various plates and meals run around $6. It's a decent amount of food but it won't feed two people or completely full you if you're hangry. NYC portions are definitely bigger and come with some pita bread on top and cost around $5-7.   My go to order: Lamb & Chicken combo. Spicy. White Sauce. ($6)  To-Dine. Yay or Nay: Definitely Yay.

Gyro was good flavor but not nearly as filling as the rice box for the same price. Either way, I'd happily eat here again anytime I need a quick bite in uptown.

They're already giving you half of what you would get at the main location but having to pay double the price is ridiculous. If you want to get your money's worth then go to their main location for better portion size (and for the same price as the cart).",

I told her I wanted extra sauce on the side because you know lots of times, places are a little stingy with the sauce and when you add rice into the equation, it soaks up the sauce and then your food is dry. She assured me that extra sauce wouldn't be needed. I trusted her and she was correct!  I ate that food so fast! I promise I didn't put my fork down once. I was honestly a little sad when I finished.

I'm not sure what it is but there has to be crack in the food cause it's addictive. The tangy white sauce mixed with the red sauce and with the finely chopped meat over the rice is mind blowing.   If you don't get in line early you will have a wait. They only accept cash and the girl taking orders is very frank. It's just her personality. They get your order placed and your food to you in a timely orderly fashion.   I think the quality and flavor of their food is better than some restaurants in the area.

Check the picture on the truck for you want  2. You'll find a friendly lady taking your cash only orders to the right of the truck  3. Pay and give your name and wait to be called  4. Turn around and see the 15 or more people waiting too  5. Grab your soda from the cooler for a $1  This spot gets nothing but love!!

Expect a line of 10 ahead of you to be cleared within 5-7 minutes, but that's just for ordering and paying. Then you have to wait to get your food. That take a a bit longer. Usually, it's about a 10 minute wait for the food.   I always order chicken over rice. It's what I've always ordered at halal trucks in new York. So, was super excited to find this really popular place. The first time I ordered, I got the wrong order... Someone must have ended up with mine too. I ended up with falafel and rice but it was pretty good and the sauces were on point and I didn't have time to go back so. I just ate it.  But now I always check to make sure I got the right order.   Their rice is on point,  their sauces are on point,   and their chicken is good.  It's chopped up so much,  it looks a little like cat food to me,  but that hasn't been a huge detterrant so far.    The chicken over rice is 6$. Pretty solid for what you're paying for and pretty good even when comparing to the NYC halal carts I used to frequent.",

Doesn't get much better than that.   $6 cash only for lamb over rice - also served with a little iceberg lettuce and some kind of amazing white sauce.",

    "text": "Delicious NY Style halal cart food that comes in massive potions at an incredibly cheap price (seriously, $6 for a plate of lamb and chicken over rice and salad with white and red sauce WITH a drink is unbeatable). The service is very friendly and fast and the food always comes out superb.  The lines can get super long around lunch (12:00) so bear that in mind.   Definitely recommend stopping for a quick lunch, as long as you're sharing or starving!",

First off, it is CASH ONLY. There is typically a one but it moves quickly.   I went with the chicken and lamb combo. Minced chicken and lamb over rice with some lettuce covered in a white sauce. Even better then it sounds. Tons of food and absolutely delish! They definitely didn't skimp on rice or meat!  This food cart is absolutely going to be a regular lunch time spot for me!",

    "text": "Omg, what an amazing treat. When I first saw the cart, I thought, \"is that the cart I've been reading about?\"  So my wife and I went to a concert, and in the middle of an amazing show, I look at my yelp app to see what time the cart closes. The answer? 4am! So my dancing and singing was amplified knowing I was going to have some food afterwards.  After the show we hustle over to the cart and order a falafel salad and their combination plate of chicken and lamb. The food was prepared super quick at the cost of $11.  When my wife and I got home, we tore into our meals. The taste was fantastic. I couldn't have been happier. The look of the dishes wasn't something you'd see in bon appetit magazine, but boy was it good.   Would I recommend? Absolutely yes! Great food, ample portion and cheap prices. Who could ask for anything more?",

I tend to get the same things (lamb and/or chicken over rice) but I've heard the cheesesteaks and gyros are good too. It's worth the trek uptown at anytime as they stay open until 4am just about every night. If you haven't stopped in def do so, best $6 spent ever!",

The most popular meal is probably lamb and chicken over rice, but I prefer just chicken over rice. It comes with a tiny bit of lettuce and a white sauce over everything. I ask for spicy sauce on the side - it's pretty hot.   It's my favorite lunch. I eat here at least once a week and I crave it constantly. I dream of Halal. Seriously, go eat here ASAP.",

    "text": "Yes!  A chicken and lamb combo over rice with a side salad for $6?  Not only is the deal amazing, the food is tasty, too.  I asked for the spicy sauce, which gave the right amount of kick to it all.  My friends and I stopped by the cart on the way to a Panthers game - great location, great price.  Service was quick, too.    A few minor downsides: 1. It's a cart, so we had to sit outside, and it was rather cold that day. 2. Its sanitation grade was an 86.  I didn't get sick after the meal, though... but if that's enough to prevent you from going, you've now been warned. 3. It's cash only, but that's not a big deal to me. 4. Parking - we were walking to the game anyway, so it wasn't an issue, but I could see it being a problem if we went just to eat there.  I don't think the parking is all that easy to find around there.  If you're in the uptown Charlotte area, make sure to stop by this halal cart.  Get the chicken and lamb combo over rice and you won't regret it.  I will be sure to be back.",

I've never deviated from ordering the chicken over rice, lamb over rice or the combo, nor have I found any reason to. The line may seem to be long during the lunch rush, but they run an efficient operation and the wait is never too bad.  My main qualm is that they only take cash, like seemingly every other halal cart in America. At least they keep the prices cheap.",
