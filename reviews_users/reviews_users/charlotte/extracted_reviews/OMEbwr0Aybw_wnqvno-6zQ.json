    "text": "Cheap forgettable food in a loud, bright atmosphere. A fork and knife in  paper bag on your table. Service is what you would expect from an overworked staff. Our waitress was pleasant but hard to find when you wanted something. The chips are tasty but so thin its impossible to dip any guac with them. The salsa is more of a Pico De Gallo than salsa you may be used to. It's fresh, tasty and has a nice little kick from fresh minced chilis. For my dinner, the beef burrito was more beans than anything else. The side of rice was dry and tasteless. I ordered a beer and I was brought a can and I had to request a glass. Maybe an ecomical fun place for a family with several kids? If your idea of a good restaurant is On The Boarder (which is much better in my opinion) or IHOP, you won't be disappointed.",

Chuy's certainly has an industrial sized ice maker as the drinks are bursting with frozen h2o!  My Bride ordered the  Quesadilla  which came in the form of 4 tacos. She was satisfied although thought the protein was a bit sparse. I ordered the Chicken burrito with the green chili sauce (3 chilis hot). While advertised as \"big as your face\" it is a bit of a over statement especially if you ask to omit the beans, which I did. If it is as big as they say....must be a lot of beans!!  Our waiter was very pleasant, knowledgeable and well schooled in the art of up selling. Each recommendation he made was highlighted in green, on the menu, was the most popular and coincidentally the most expensive. I fell prey to his strong recommendation of the Boom Boom sauce. It was good as I ordered a side sampler and payed $3.59 for 3 tablespoons full.  We'll be back for Happy Hour but dinner probably not!",

I ordered veggie enchiladas since I'm vegetarian, and they gave me chicken enchiladas. I didn't realize it until I took a bite and it was too late. And the veggie enchiladas, one of the few vegetarian options, weren't good either. Definitely not coming here again.",

The margaritas are also very good at reasonable prices and a good selection.   Now the bad:  Food. It is bland and flavorless. My wife and I have eaten here two times and tried various dishes. All have been disappointing. Too bad because we love Mexican food and good Tex mex. this trip I ordered the steak burrito that was supposed to come with a green chili inside. The only thing inside was steak. So what I received was a flour tortilla with chunks of meat inside. Nothing else, that's it. When I asked the waitress she shrugged her shoulders and said \"oh\" that's funny. It should have stuff inside. My wife ordered the sampler appetizer plate so she could try a variety of items. All were bland and disappointing.  I can see how this food might appeal to many people who have not had flavorful, good Mexican food.  For me, I will come back for drinks and chips and salsa, but I will not eat here.",

The waitress returned in 10 minutes with my actual order (shrimp tacos). One of my tacos didn't have any sauce at all, the rice and the beans were lukewarm and dry.

The chicken is actually kinda bland in the flautas. The nachos are really good because they are not just chips tossed on a plat but rather they have attention placed on each one. The Boom Boom sauce is excellent. My biggest downside is that the last two times we've been there we had the same server and he is extremely lackluster and doesn't pay much attention to his customers. He's walked away from me twice as I was making a drink order and trying to ask for more salsa but he didn't hear because he was walking away from me. I'd definitely want a different server if I went back. Decent place and always busy but not the best Mexican food in the area.",

During the week they have a free nacho bar during happy hour. Our favorites are: make sure to request the creamy jalapeno dip (it's free) with your chips, tortilla soup is the best I've ever had, beef fajitas, boom boom enchiladas, shrimp & cheese relleno, Baja shrimp tacos, their refried beans are to die for, hatch green chile rice and Mexican Martini (you can ask for 2 glasses). My 5 yo son loves to get just a side order of fajita chicken, refried beans and Mexican rice. Since we moved here I've been about 3 times and the service was fine.",

During that visit we found the staff to be friendly, the food came out quick and it was delicious. On our second visit we took our sons out for their birthday's for dinner and we had to wait over 45 minutes for an appetizer to come out and then another 20 minutes for our dinners to show up. The food was good, not as good as the first time but that is the only thing that would bring us back again. The wait staff was pretty much non-existent during our 2nd visit. The hostess had to take us to 3 different tables before she found one that was supposed to be vacant. They seemed to be totally disorganized on the 2nd visit. Hopefully the service improves as they have a good food selection and it is good.",

YOU MUST TRY THE CREAMY JALAPENO DIP!  I also really like the beef fajitas.  The flour tortillas are fluffy and delicious, and I always order extra.  Don't skip this place because \"it's just a chain.\"  That's crazy!  It is a chain because it is good and they expanded.  Whoo hoo!  I have been to so called Mexican food places out here since I relocated with flour tortilla enchiladas (what!!?!), \"nacho cheese dip with jalapeno\" (just, NO!), and other terrible so called Mexican food abominations.  This is uniquely TexMex.  They do not claim to be authentic Mexican.  It is fun, inexpensive, and good rock n roll music to boot.  The ritas are great too.  This is the only place this homesick Texan can find good TexMex east of the Mississippi! Oh, and the Tres Leches Cake is unbelievably delicious.

We waited for 2 hours and he just continuously kept sitting other people into the empty tables that we were told would be kept together for us. If her couldn't handle the situation, which was obvious, he did not need to continue to feed us lies. We finally confronted him and demanded he seat us anywhere because he was accomplishing nothing for our benefit.   When we were seated, he told the waitress to make sure her table was taken care of immediately, but forgot to tell the waiter of the tables the same thing. By this time it wasn't important to be served quickly, but we would've liked to have been served together.   I might have gone back to this restaurant for the mediocre food, but with management like this establishment has, I am certain my money won't be spent here ever again.",

The waitress stood off to the side talking with another waitress, making eye contact with my husband as he tried to get her attention and ignored him for a good couple of minutes.

    "text": "Chuys isn't much to talk about for me. It's not authentic Mexican in my opinion so you have to take it for what it's worth.  The frozen margaritas & sangrias are worth a seat at the bar or in the bar area especially during the week between 4pm - 7pm where you can munch on nachos for free while you sip via the Happy Hour complimentary Nacho car. We've had take out from here once and wasn't impressed as the food lacked flavor and seasoning. My husband and I had the fish and the shrimp tacos and the batter on the seafood wasn't very tasty. Our son had the a child's chicken quesadilla which wasn't very yummy for him either. The cheese seemed to be like American cheese which isn't good cheese for a quesadilla. I returned today for some frozen margaritas with my neighbor for her birthday and we dined in at the bar. I wasn't interested in trying the good again so we stuck to the FREE nachos and ordered cocktails. I had the frozen sangria and she had the frozen raspberry margarita. ALL In ALL my fav item was the Tres Leches Yum Yum Yum did I say Yum?",

Sometimes the battery on the remote would die on my way there and I would have to phone a miniature horse to get me the rest of the way. Once Chuys moved to its new location it only became a few days away traveling by hot air balloon. I come here often when I can get my hot air balloon to start up. This place is as good as some butternut squash on a hot day. When I come here I try to see how many chips I can stuff in my body before they ask what I want as an entree so that I can leave like the cheapskate that I am. I prefer the creamy jalapeno dip here, it is fantastic. A lot better than the chunky, moldy cheese that I've had in my refrigerator for the past 2 decades :)",

Sometimes you get a good sever and decent food, others ( and more often)  it's an apathetic server or snarky bartender who can't mix a drink to save their life and subpar food.   You guys are gonna have to do better if you want to compete with everything else opening in this area. Start by teaching your staff to care and then teach the bartenders to be welcoming and learn how to make a margarita.   We ordered top shelf liquor (tres generaciones anejo and don julio silver, respectively, both with grand marnier) and they will remain on the table when we leave due to the bartender mixing sooooo much sweet n sour in them. Just gross. Oh, and we caught attitude from the twat mixing them because it was a half hour before closing and she wanted to socialize with her coworkers vs waiting on customers. Smh",

The restaurant atmosphere is fun and festive, with colorful mexican decorations inside and globe lights outside. The food was good, pretty average tex-mex, but what pushed it over the top was the sauces. I had a bean and cheese burrito, which on it's own would have seemed a little plain, but paired with the creamy jalapeno sauce-worth coming back for. The highlight of the evening was definitely the service. Our server Danya was one of the best servers we have ever had.  She was friendly, yet still polite, informative and helpful. She helped us with anything we could need and she even moved our table when it started to rain (we were sitting outdoors).  We will definitely be returning, and we hope Danya will be our server!",

Further, there are pictures on the wall of who-knows-who, and they just seemed really out of place with everything else.  The food was bland. I had the soft tacos and the beef was overcooked. The \"regular salsa\" was scorching hot (way too spicy). Portions were large. Nothing to write home about. Service was good and attentive. Prices were okay. Nothing really special about this place to make me want to come back.",

I'm just standing there, waiting to be seated, but they're talking about a boy asking one of them out.  Completely rude and apathetic.  I can't imagine why the manager has these kids at the front of their establishment.  I waited a good 5 minutes before I told them that I was going to seat myself at the bar.  One grabbed a menu and escorted me.  She had an attitude the whole time.  Customer service clearing lacking.  The bartender, on the other hand, was great.  Personable, checked up on me several times, kept my drink filled...did his job & did it well. I'll go back, but I'll say something to management if those kids up front aren't doing their job.

So once I heard there was one coming to Charlotte, I was ecstatic. I've been to this location a few times and it was average but tonight was horrible. It started off great, no wait, and the host and hostess were super friendly. The waitress came over quickly and was friendly as well. She kept our chips and salsa, along with our drink cups filled. But after this party came in beside us, it was as if we didn't exist. Our drinks didn't get filled, our requests weren't delivered and we waited, and waited. The table beside us had all of their needs met and all of ours were just forgotten. A member at my table asked for lemons to go with her water twice, I asked for Togo boxes twice, and we said we needed to place a Togo order repeatedly. Once we finally got our bills there was an error and she changed our bill AFTER we had given her our card. I understand completely fixing the error, but please inform me before you change something on my bill when you have my card in your possession. A member at our table gave cash as payment, and she gave her the incorrect change back. It seemed that there was just issue after issue with the service, which is a shame because the food was fantastic. The food is ultimately what kept me coming back all of these years, and the reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars instead of 1.",

We had a great time chatting with the bartenders and owner, even though they were crazy busy. I had a frozen margarita and it was delicious and CHEAP. We ordered queso and it was to die for. For entrees, we both had the enchiladas with the boom boom sauce, it was so tasty!!! We had a great time and I was excited to come back which leads to a tale of great triumph.  I dragged my husband here on a Saturday night and since I had seen it crazy on a Tuesday I was expecting the worse. It had a crazy wait at 6:45 and we just went in to see the wait time. We were right behind a disgruntled middle aged man who dramatically hands the buzzer back to the young hostess and tells her \"I give up\". She politely asked if he wanted her to check his party's spot on the list. He says sure and she come back from looking at the list and I saw the most awesome thing I've ever witnessed at a hostess stand. She says so politely with a smile on her face \"sir, you got here 5 minutes ago and I told you the wait was an hour and 55 minutes\". He just looks at her and embarrassing leaves. You go girl!

    "text": "Completely disrespectful. My wife and I came in and sat at the patio. Our waitress Christin came over and asked for drinks, we both got waters, she came back with them and chips and salsa and then things seemed to horribly decline.   My wife asked a simple question about a menu option (about being able to select a certain enchilada on a combo) she seemed very annoyed, rudely said \"I'll make it happen.\" Then just walked to take my order. We both wanted Charro beans instead of refried beans but were both so distracted by the attitude, we completely forgot and she never asked what kind we wanted anyway.  Following this she never came back to refill our chips and salsa or waters, and ignored us, we watched her bring more to several other tables around us. (We know she saw we were out of everything as she looked at our table several times) We sat there with nothing left to snack on and no water. (See Pics) we literally finished the entire meal and sat around for about 15 minutes and she never once even asked or offered anything. Following our food coming out, she didn't even check back in to be sure everything was ok or that it had come out correctly.  After about 15 more minutes of sitting there trying to figure out what we could have possibly done to her, she returned with the check without asking about needing anything else, or dessert (which we originally planned on getting). At this point she did ask if we wanted boxes and we declined. When she returned with my card, she sat it down on the table next to me and said \"here you go.\" And then walked off. No \"Thank You\", no nothing. So awkward.  On the bright side, the girl who ran our food out was really polite and thankfully she came because we weren't given napkins or utensils. Not sure what her name was, she seemed around 20's possibly and had several tattoos and she was great. The food was also pretty good and the space had a nice vibe, but that was crushed by our waitress who just seemed mad at the world.  Overall, the food was very good, but the service killed this place for us. And just to clarify, the restaurant was busy, but not crazy and she seemed to tend to the tables to our left and right without any trouble. We just felt very singled out for no reason, it was very strange.",

    "text": "First off.. I never post and if I do it is a short summary. I used to manage restaurant and understand the business. That being said......  We went for a little family fun Friday night. They are supposed to have a little cart in the bar with chips, dips and taco meat until 7pm.At 6pm the cart was barren. no queso, no salsa and the taco meat that was left was dried out.   We sat in the bar and asked if it would be restocked. They refilled some but never refilled the meat. Not the end of the world but if you offer it to attract customers don't do it 1/2 as@.  Dinner was disappointing as well. Food was fair. Hence 2 stars and not 1. The first drink from the bar took a long time and had something in it. The waitress returned it to the bar and I watched the bartender give it away to a regular sitting at the bar. (I was also walking by the bar shortly after and the bartender gave the same group another apparently free drink since he said here you go I made this by mistake.)  The food came but was hard to eat without silverware or plates. The kids taco looked horrible. After 5 minutes and cold fajitas we got silverware. A third drink that  was ordered during dinner arrived 10 minutes later when we were done   In short, average food and poor execution .",

If you do risk a trip there, order as quickly as you can, since their kitchen is extremely slow!  The food is pretty uninspired. The \"enchilada\" was some seasoned meat inside a regular tortilla, not even baked together with melted cheese on top.  The relleno was very small.  The tacos were made wrong and had to be re-made.  We have tried eating there 3 times, and have been pretty let down. We tried ordering to go, and it took forever as well.  They have some issues to work out.  Hopefully they get there.",

When a party left the staff quickly turned the table around for the next party.  We were regularly visited by Bri and other staff dropped by to make sure everything was okay.  This seemed like a well run operation.   This is a family restaurant.  Our party was much older than the typical patrons, but that was not a problem.    The restaurant is surprisingly large in size and is divided into several sections.  Maximum capacity was posted at around 287, as I recall.  They have a large outside open porch/dining area that would have been great if it hadn't been so cold.  Maybe next time.    I ordered the No 5, which was a chalupa and enchilada, with rice and refried beans.  There are no photos of the dishes, so I ordered strictly by the written description. When it arrived it looked like the sort of dish I would not have typically ordered, but it was fantastic.  Our party also ordered two servings of fajitas and one cheese and bean burrito.  We were all very pleased with the meals.  We will definitely be back.",

Although the food at this location is good, the chuy changa being my personal favorite with the creamy jalapeno sauce, the service is still lacking. I don't believe I've ever been there no matter where I get sat, and have been given silverware and  napkins without asking for them. A place that has a free nacho bar, which I love, those are some damn good chips,  does not think it's important to give you a napkin and silverware!  And when you do ask for it, they seem surprised.   I've held off complaining about this to let the newness wear off but it's been open 8 months now, and it's still happening.

Upon arrival the hostess seriously appeared as though we were bothering her. She dumped us at a table right in front of the kitchen (seriously high traffic and the waitstaff kept knocking my purse off the back of my chair). We ultimately moved to a booth. The young lady that waited on us was sweet. VERY YOUNG, so I can let it slide that we waited a long time for her to take our order or check on us. (Seriously, we never complain about that either - but it was a noteworthy amount of time between visits to our table). The guy who filled our chips was hysterical. He appeared so angry at everyone and definitely seemed hung over - at one point he literally missed half the basket and chips were all over the table and on our laps. (Nope, he didn't even look at us to notice his mess or our chuckle). The food was fine - came out warm, was seemingly fresh, but a bit sloppy (tacos had cheese, lettuce and such falling out instead of actually just being on the side). Our little guy seriously LOVED the kid mini tacos and he cleaned up the rice and beans too, so that's something. (He never does that). If service was a bit less comically tragic, we'd consider going back - but it's ok, we figure it'll catch up eventually. This place is rocking busy and people won't tolerate that for long before Management catches on. We'll try again in the fall.",

It kept breaking every time I tried to get some dip. I got one of the combos that come with chicken. enchilada and chicken chalupa. It looked almost the same as my friend's combo, who had a Taco and enchilada???? If anything my chalupa looked more like a tostada. It came with rice and beans. I told my server that I didn't eat beans he stated he would give me two sides of rice. When the food came I got beans and rice. (Honest mistake, I told the runner that gave us the food. She told me she would bring it out and we never got it) I usually eat all my food...my friend and I ate less than half of both of our foods. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because our server was nice and refilled our cups and chips often. The nacho bar that was included with our meal was nice, though there was only three things to select from. It probably woulda been better to have salsa or hot sauce available at the bar. With that being said though, I also added points for the dips we got at the table (salsa and guacamole). Just for those two points though, I wouldn't come and eat their food again. I might come back for some drinks because they looked good but that's it lol.",

We actually like hot food ,but this was so hot/not enjoyable, starting with the complementary salsa that comes with the chips on the table. We have eaten at Chuys before, and this was not the same. When we asked for less heat in the salsa, they graciously brought us different sauces that were milder.   There was WAY too much jalapeno in everything we ordered, except for the guacamole and the kids' meals. But that may just be our taste.  On the bright side: Our waiter was great, and the service was fast.   The kids loved it too!  My only truly negative comment is that there seemed to be way more hostesses than needed (3+ on a Sunday afternoon) , to the point that they would rather stand around socializing than bring people to their tables. And the girl who originally greeted us was sitting off to the side on a bench with a giant make-up kit, putting on her make up, not even acknowledging guests, when we left. Very unprofessional.",

We will continue to make the 30 minute drive out here for our favorites, not to forget the creamy jalapeno sauce and the homemade tortillas.

I am very please with his attentiveness and commitment to make sure his customers are treated well.  Today, a week later, we went back and the service was horrible. There was no one on our side of the restaurant, only our table and another table. The hostess was wonderful and fetched our chips for us. A waiter or waitress did not come by for ten minutes to take our drink order. This isn't acceptable for how slow they were. To make things worse, a waiter and waitress were whispering right in front of our table trying to figure out who had us. I finally spoke up and let them know we had been sitting there for 10 minutes. The waitress, maybe she's new, but she would forget everything. She forgot the straws, my order did not have the guacamole I asked for, she hardly checked up on us, and our drinks were never refilled. I'm really disappointed that our second visit was subpar. Somebody needs to increase Madison's hours, because she is the best waitress in that place. I'm sad we couldn't have her again today.",

The chips were warm and very light. And the salsa has a nice little kick.   I was hungry so I went with the chicken burrito. With burritos, you can pick your sauce. I'd sugguest taking the sauce your online ahead of time so you don't hold others in your party up. There are several, maybe five or six to choose from. Kara had to help me.  I went with the deluxe tomatillo sauce. Excellent choice. It was a creamy white sauce; I wasn't in the mood for a red sauce after salsa.   Burritos are HUGE! They come with a choice of rice. I selected Mexican rice. The dish was very tasty. It was just too large even for my hunger status. I probably finished about 3/4 of it before waving the white flag.",

Chicken I so dry!   I was disappointed. They really need to revamp recipes or monitor to see if they are being followed.  I couldn't eat my food. My son didn't eat his and my husband ... well he was hungry and ate it but complained the whole time of how awful it was.    Another thing that threw me off was I told them I had a cheese allergy.  My plate arrived and under the wilted salad garnish was dry stuck on cheese.  Made me think. Did they spill a blob of cheese by accident or was this what didn't come clean from the last user.  Just weird as it was completely covered with the lettuce and salad. Maybe it was on purpose. I couldn't eat after that.   We won't be back, unless we just want drinks, chips and salsa.

Food was not good, bad experience! 2nd visit, was in the area and we tried it again, waited 10 minutes for waiter and another 25 minutes before food came out. Food not good at all and waiter was rude, dumped a refill of chips in tray with a large scoop and most went on the table. Had a friend with us this time just a bad experience overall. That's it... never eat there again.",

The chips are light & crispy, but the salsa is just so-so.    What bothers me the most at this location is the lack of cleanliness on the menus, tables, and ledges.  (Yet, they'll sweep right next to you while you're eating!  Just let me enjoy my meal in peace.)  I just can't look past the sticky/wet menus and dead flies in the windowsill.   Service was good tonight but has been horrible in the past. Team members don't smile and seem like they're just trying to get out of there.    Just disappointing.",

    "text": "I have given this restaurant two tries. And have been completely and utterly disappointed each time. The last visit I literally had a panic attack and vowed never to return.   The first time we went, we were a party of 5. It took an hour to get seated and an hour after ordering to get our food. We had no intention of being there for the whole night but we were stuck. And then when we got our food, our friend's burrito took another 15 minutes. My friend didn't want to cause a scene, so we didn't say anything about it even though a good manager or waiter would have taken that off the bill. However our waitress was the most unobservant human on the globe, so she probably didn't even notice.  Despite that, the food was pretty good. Very Americanized mexican food, lots of cheese, which we liked!   Second visit we went for lunch, just me and my husband. We put our name in and the hostess told us 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, we went back to the hostess stand to ask what was up. Some guy (manager) started laughing at the hostess and told her you gave them a dead buzzer! They seated us right after with no apology. Whatever, I didn't really care that much about that. They sat us in the tiniest booth ever right in front of a huge 12 people party with at least 4 babies screaming their little heads off. They were literally 1 foot away from me. I couldn't even breathe it was so loud and tight. And then the sun was beaming through their blinds and blinding me, making me regretting forgetting sun glasses. Whatever. I don't care, we finally got our food!! ... but it was wrong. They got both of our burritos wrong, So they took them back and we waited another 20 minutes and finally got our food. But at point, we were exhausted and I wanted to leave so bad.... the manager was sweet and comped our food but the experience was truly awful. Oh and for the love of god, stay away from the beans.",

I could decide between the Chuychunga(steak) and a taco salad. My wife ordered the taco salad so i went with the chunga. I was deeply disappointed.  It was pretty dry and it was supposed to come with queso that was missing. The flavoring was bland and very lacking. The plate included mexican rice where the serving size probably would have sufficed for our 2 year old. There was no sour cream on the side with the smidget(country term) of lettuce and salsa that garnished the plate.  My wife enjoyed her taco salad so it wasnt a disaster but as far a return visit...Negative. The service was ok. The waitress was nice but she was pretty absent the entire meal. She came back once after i was half way through my meal and at that time i had to ask for more sprite as my cup was completely empty. I wouldnt return nor recommend Chuy's but i can say I've tried them.",

I ordered the chicken stuffed avocado. Pretty tasty it was but it left this weird after taste in my mouth.

Soft tacos are also served with guacamole ~ another taste treat!  My only objection is to the noise level.

I'm not complaining about it because I clearly knew what I was ordering.  I liked the sauces and the margarita was well made.  The margarita tasted like it was scratch made.  I didn't see if it was or not by DJ Toots or T Crush or whatever the bartender calls himself did a good job.

My sister got the chicken quesadilla and added jalapenos and it was so good.  We also ordered dessert which was awesome.  We noticed there was a free nacho bar and lots of pictures of dogs on the wall.  Our waitress was awesome.  I enjoyed her!  She was there when we needed her and very friendly...  I'll personally return to this location.",

I chose the stacked enchilladas made with blue corn tortillas.  Was very happy with my choice.  Service was very good - our waitress was very attentive to keeping the chip baskets filled.  The chips and sauces were a highlight.  Super thin and crispy and interesting dipping a to along with.  I order a frozen strawberry margarita, nothing to write home about the best I can say is that it was a nice fruity drink...minus the salt which was a bit surprising.  If you're thinking of trying it out, bring them the framed pic of your furry family member, they'll pop it up on the wall and give you a free appetizer!",

    "text": "Chuy's is not your typical Mexican restaurant. First of all, it is Tex-Mex. which in my experience has usually meant Mexican food for the \"gringo \". And while some of that may be True here, the food was better overall than say on the border or the like. That being said, Chuy's could make some small changes that would make a big difference. Firstly, and most importantly, why in the world would you not have any beers on draft? Bottles only? Really? Next, you would think that on cinco de mayo you would have some great food and drink specials right? Not so much. 5 dollar queso or guacamole and dollar off Dos Equis bottles. I asked for a spicier salsa option and was surprised to be offered Tabasco. I've been to Texas, heck I was born in Texas. We like our salsa spicy. Salsas were neither Tex or Mex. I must say that they did have some spicier sauce options for burritos and enchiladas but those were for covering not dipping. I gave Chuy's 3 stars instead of two for the reasonable prices. As you can see from the picture of my entree, I got my monies worth for 11 bucks. It was also nice that the kids meals came with a drink and desert. It just wasn't enough to make me want to run back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Menu was decently large. Lots to choose from.  Food was very good. That's the end of the pros. We were seated and waited 11 min before our waitress showed up. Took our drink and food order. 35 min for our food to get to us. It was a Saturday night, so not really complaining there. Once our food got out, we realized we didn't have any cutlery. Waited and waited before our waitress came back around.  Finally asked for some. About 5 min later, another waiter came by and said Sorry, we are out of silverware. But you can just use these. And set down plastic cutlery in bags with a napkin and I think salt/pepper.   I was like I'm NOT going to eat a $15 per person meal with plastic. I want silverware. So we sat for 35 min (no exaggeration) before I saw someone in the back bagging up silverware. I figured our waitress would bring it out. Nope. I had to track her down again and ask for some. By this time our food had cooled down a good bit. I would have figured someone would have just hand washed 2 sets and brought them out instead of what did happen. Sheesh.   Like I said, food was pretty darn good. Wasn't impressed with the portion size I received either. Guess this place is just a one visit show for me.",

    "text": "I love this place. I was first introduced to Chuy's at it's origin - Austin, TX. My sister moved there and every time I come to visit, she makes sure we at least eat here once.   My favorite dish there is Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Pulled chicken in tortilla smothered in green sauce (boom boom sauce), rice, beans, tomatillos and jalapenos.   Drink of choice: Tito's Cherry Limeade..........Tito's Vodka another Austin staple. (if you like Sonic's Cherry Limeade, this is your adult version)  Always get the queso with the chips. I do like the salsa the chips come with. I often mix queso with the salsa.  Atmosphere: It's eclectic, it's loud, it's Elvis - in True Chuy fashion. I still don't know what Elvis has to do with all this, but there was a shrine in the back where we sat.  Service: We got seated quickly on a saturday night. Seems like it's a go-to place for family dinners. Lot's of families / groups there. Staff is quick and friendly.  Parking: Again, we went there on a Saturday night, parking was packed. Encountered a jerk that was racing to find the next available parking spot going 90 mph. So maybe try to avoid the \"rush\" hours?  Will definitely be back here.....the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom tasted just as good as I remember from my times in Austin.",

I had the Friday special of the fat daddy enchiladas and let me just start with there was nothing \"fat\" about them!! They were just regular enchiladas and sadly lukewarm, even though the restaurant was pretty empty. The chicken inside was white and didn't have seasoning, tasted like it had been boiled while the tortilla was dry and felt more like a cracker even though it was topped with cheese sauce (asked for queso instead of the green sauce it normally comes with)....I couldn't even finish one!  This Tex-Mex is more like the McDonalds of Mexican food...if you've had the real deal and love flavour, this is not the place for you!  Our waitress was friendly, chips were fresh and jalepeno sauce (with a ranch base) that came with the chips was pretty good. The salsa was fresh but bland. I visited their SouthPark location way back and hated the combo plate I ordered. I thought to give them another chance but that was a big mistake!",

The salsa that came with the chips was really, REALLY good. I had 2 chili rellenos: roasted chicken and ground sirloin, that came with the usual refried beans and rice.

Sadly, the Shrimp & Cheese Rellenos were so overstuffed with chopped cilantro, you couldn't taste any of the interior ingredients. The fried crust on the exterior of the massive Anaheim peppers was freakishly crunchy - almost like Corn Flakes - and peeled off in one giant sleeve of shell-like goodness. Still, the cilantro -packed into the peppers like grass clippings in a lawnmower bag- completely spoiled the dish.   The Elvis Green Chili Fried Chicken saved the day with its quirky deep-fried chicken breast breaded with Lay's Potato Chips and smothered in green chili sauce and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese - certainly a dish worthy of \"The Kang\"!  The boozy margaritas help wash down the bagged tortillas and watery pico de gallo-style salsa - we were unimpressed with the rather flavorless guacamole.",

But service was prompt and accurate. We could have been given a third table which would have helped. The guacamole was especially good.  It was a combination of pieces of avocado plus mashed, allowing the 3 colors of avocado to shine through. It was not overly spiced and they added chopped tomato on top rather than stir it through which meant it was not watered down. There was a jalapeno dip that was excellent and not too spicy too. The tortillas were extra thin the way I like them. I had quesadillas, and those who had fajitas were pleased. They handled 7 patrons with ease.",

Our waitress immediately came by with fresh warm tortilla chips and salsa. My friend asked for their jalapeno sauce which she then brought two of. This is a great sauce in which to dip the tortillas! I enjoyed the house margarita (had to smile when asked for my ID) then ordered the Deluxe chicken enchiladas with mexican rice and refried beans. I also ordered a side scoop of guacamole because well - because! The chicken was tender and moist, wrapped in a fresh tortilla and smothered in that jalapeno sauce - yum.

    "text": "So, I wrote the home office. They say you'll be contacted shortly....I guess two plus weeks isn't shortly enough. We loved the Southpark location. What a shame they couldn't replicate it at Waverly. We went the first time during their second week after opening. Having been in the business before I put it up to new location, new employees, still working out the bugs. I'll always give a restaurant the SECOND CHANCE. I waited six months...boy was I wrong. The most enjoyable part of our second time was our waitress, the Beer and the Margarita. It started out with Chips so salty I had to slurp up two tall glasses of water. Maybe they were trying to up their Beer sales. Off the Children's Menu the Burrito was tasteless and not even hot enough to melt the cheese. My Shrimp Tacos were so heavily breaded I had to peel the breading off so I could taste the Shrimp! There were six thin slices of Red Cabbage and the Cilantro was crammed on one end of the Taco. My Rice was just two degrees over room temperature. My wife's Stuffed Peppers also had an overabundance of breading. For some reason her rice was hot. My wife had walked over to the free HAPPY HOUR NACHO BAR and came back with a total look of disgust; over picked, crusty cheese sauce and dried out toppings. When our waitress came by with the bill she asked how everything was. I had to be honest and I told her she was great but the food was horrible. She said she would get the manager. I explained everything to him and he apologized. He did the correct thing and comped the food. He also gave me a coupon for three free appetizers and entrees and asked me to give them one more try. I said I would but truth be told...no restaurant gets a third try. I gave the coupon to my sister who fortunately had a good dining experience there.",

    "text": "This is pretty great Tex-Mex food! The chips are thin and crispy, the sauces are great, and I love the enchiladas. Chuy's enchiladas beat your standard Mexican restaurant enchiladas in my opinion hands down. The tortillas are fantastic too, so you won't get a cold corn tortilla with some last minute sauce thrown on top, the sauce actually soaks through. I usually get the Elves Presley Combo and take home a bit over half every time, because it's SO MUCH FOOD. I like that you can get one of each enchilada (beef, cheese, and chicken) so if you haven't tried their enchiladas, it's a good way to try them. I will say that the regular beef tacos are average, but you can ask for some of the sauces to spice them up, and they do come pretty loaded with filling. I think what I like best is that a lot of the offerings have a little kick to them, and you can taste the fresh ingredients. We haven't had any bad experiences with the servers, and everything's been fine for us. Remember, this is Tex Mex you guys! So don't expect authentic Mexican tacos!",

The wait was short, around five minutes, and the food was delicious (I recommend the fish tacos or the oven roasted chicken burrito). The real reason for this review though is our waiter Matthew, who was incredible. I have never had more attentive service anywhere. He kept everything topped off, checked on our food, brought the check immediately... His hard work and attention to detail made for a very enjoyable experience and we will definitely be back soon. Thanks, Matthew!",

Handmade tortillas, queso compuesto and a variety of unique sauces for enchiladas (or chips!) are the pillars of its greatness. And don't forget amazingly fresh tortilla chips and salsa and of course, the dot and swirl margaritas! Stop by weekdays from 4-7 to enjoy the free queso bar- you won't regret it! The fun atmosphere and funky decor works for date night, family night or any night!!",

I had the classic enchiladas, but found them to be simply two, flat unrolled tortillas with chicken in the middle, covered in unremarkable sauce.  Standard Mexican rice and re-fried beans accompanied.  Nobody at our table of five thought their meal was more than \"ok\".  The pricing was reasonable, but we did limit additional purchases of drinks and dessert due to the apathetic server.  When I talked to a manager about the poor service and the word-of-mouth reputation Chuy's was developing nearby, he apologized and provided a full voucher for our next meal.  As a result, we will give Chuy's a second chance but we were far from impressed in our first visit.",

They said they'd have one cleaned off for me first. This took a good 10 minutes.  When we got to our table, our server was not very engaging.  She did not recommend anything, or come back for a drink order, even though I had told her I might want something other than water, but wasn't sure at the time. She never checked back on drinks.  When our food arrived, we did not have any silverware. We asked for silverware and napkins, and they brought silverware, but no napkins.  A while later, I hadn't seen our server. I saw the host come by, and asked her for some napkins. She said she'd get them for us but NEVER brought them. My wife had to get up and get the napkins herself!  Finally, no offers for dessert, just a question \"do you want your check?\"  Very poor customer service. This is the third time we have been to this Chuy's. I expect it will be our last.  Oh, the one redeeming attribute? Even though the service was terrible, the food was good.",

We went when it opened in Dec and had horrible service and food was mediocre at best   i chalked it up to a new opening and figured I would give it settling time.  So we came again tonight.  Waited at least 10 min before being acknowledged.  We were finally brought drinks after 2 servers came to us, 1 beer and 1 margarita.  Took another 5 min and asking where my daughter's coke was before we got it.  Food was ok, not the best but not the worst.  Could have maybe been ok with it and coming back 1 more time.  However, ordered another drink and waited 15 min, 2 servers checking and both said it was coming.  When it was finally brought to me 1 of the servers whispers to me how bad the bartender is and that they are tying to get rid of him.  Proceeds to tell they have had multiple firings for drinking behind the bar.  Needless to say I doubt I will be giving more of my money to this establishment or recommending it to anyone else",

My husband and I walk in for the first time on Sunday evening and the first thing we notice is the trash in the lobby (dirty styrofoam take out). We don't realize how bad it's really going to get until we're taken to our table by the hostess. With the hostess in front of us, all we see as we walk around the restaurant to get to our table are dirty dishes and trash stacked everywhere on the tables from previous customers. The feeling of filth was only exaggerated by the amount of food on the floor. With much disappointment, we could not bring ourselves to eat here. We explained this to the hostess before leaving and what could have been a manager. Finally, as we are  walking out, we notice that even their doors had the look of not having been cleaned all day, while the two hostesses stand there with nothing to do. Sad for Waverly.",

Then when we were finally seated we waited 15 minutes until the waitress even came up to take her drink order.  Next, salsa was delivered with no chips and we had not received the drinks yet they arrived about five minutes later.  The waitress then took our order and brought the wrong queso about five minutes later that we sent back.  When the food finally arrived 45 minutes later it was cold and one of our party's salad was not served with the others... We addressed this with the waitress. While we were waiting for her food to arrive about 10 minutes later the waitress comes back and says that she's told the kitchen three times that she was missing the Grilled Chicken Salad but they still have not made it for her so she was sending the manager to our table.  When he arrived he had salad in hand and did not apologize for such the delay.  Very poor service....oh yeah and we had to ask to receive silverware twice.   We will not return",

My only gripe, and it is a small one, is no draft beer. But they have a great selection of Mexican and local beers. They even have some of that yellow water with bud or coors on it if that's your thing. Great service from the bar. Not much of a liquor drinker but the wife loves their skinny margaritas.

This location leaves a lot to be desired, bar area is small, dining area smallest of any Chuy's we've ever been to, and the service can be horrendously slow and poor in general. The South Park location was so much better, but also a lot less busy even considering the Cowfish overflow people.   Still, I give this place 5 stars because the food never disappoints. My wife gets the same thing every time, Chicka-chicka Boom Boom. If you like chicken enchiladas and spicy sauce, this is the go-to dish esp with the hatch chile rice, that you can also sub with any meal.   I've ventured all over the menu, my favorite is the chile relleno with shredded chicken. Also the cornflake fried chicken is good, always the big as yo face burrito is a good choice esp if you are hungry.   Hopefully the service improves and the wait gets shorter, sometimes it is as long as 2 hours for a table of 5!  You can always try the open seating at the bar.  With the rest of Waverly slowly opening, I can only hope it improves.",

Side note, if you like slightly spicy ask for a side of jalapeno ranch.  You can eat this with chips or with your meal.  I wish they sold bottles of this deliciousness!  The perfect margarita was exactly that, perfect.  We had one lime and one mango.  Lastly everything is fresh and waiter was very attentive.  He was working quite a few tables but he moved quickly and stayed on top of things.  Manager stopped by all tables to make sure everything was ok.  Very nice gesture.",

The server, who didn't give us a name, came up after nearly 5 minutes and said \"are you ready to order?\" Well, no. I would like a water, maybe an appetizer, actually just a little bit of hospitality. His trainee (maybe) brought us chips & water quickly, but don't worry, we were immediately asked again \"you ready to order?\" Then a different server came by about 2 minutes later, asking the same question.. so we went ahead and ordered. Our server never checked back, except to drop the check, which had his name on it... Andrew. His $20 loss, since we were going to have another margarita. We never saw a manager, until our departure, when he was perched up in the bar area. Overall less than pleasurable experience",

After observing servers and others walking around us assisting others for about 10 mins we decided to leave. Upon leaving I asked for management. He apologize and wanted to take care of us.

Usually we can tune them out but when you add the stench of skunks/drugs it was too much. Our server Melissa was passive towards us and seemed to be too busy gossiping then taking care of us. Luckily, the food was a good distraction. We will not be back unless for takeout.",

Food was good though, but our waiter was so bad I would have to give 3 stars.  Love the Greenville location, you guys should go have dinner there and see what you need to do",

Outdoor area to sit and eat/drink. Located in the Waverly complex-this will be a mad house in a few years. Parking lot with multiple other shops and restaurants and apartments.",

    "text": "I definitely won't be back. We sat on the patio on a nice 65 degree night. The chips were the only good thing like people have said. Also, this is the first place I've ever been to that gives you extra spicy salsa with the chips, which I didn't mind but my bf sure couldn't handle it. The queso was meh. It took us a long time to get our drink order then our appetizer ordered. Then we sat with our menus closed for thirty minutes before getting our entrees ordered. Finally when our food did come it was delivered by a manager who said \"wow if you can survive sitting under this heater you can survive anything\"... from the manager. Yes, we felt like we might need to put on sunscreen, our table was literally hot but at least the Above food warmer made sure our food didn't get cold. Who tests a heater at max level when it's only 65 degrees and doesn't even turn it off after realizing it's burning hot! The food was not so great. Beans were dry, rice hard and dry, cheese enchilada and tacos not great. Burrito bad. They have a lot of work to do.",
