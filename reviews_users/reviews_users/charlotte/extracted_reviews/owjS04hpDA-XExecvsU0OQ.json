    "text": "I love this place, for one main reason: California Salad ($10.99).  Grilled chicken, walnuts, goat cheese, berries...what a trip.    The negatives are there - serious wait, usually lots of people outside the door for a 2-3 hour stretch saturdays and sundays.  Also, bacon/meat isn't included in a breakfast platter - so the $6.99 breakfast has to be upcharged $3.29 if you want those two or three strips of bacon.  Occasionally I can get 12 oz or even a pound of bacon around that price.  If you can't tell, I am a big bacon fan so this makes me sad...skipping the bacon makes me sad.  :(  But the food is a good time, they offer sourdough toast, their drinks (mimosa, peach bellini, etc) are awesome for brunch, their servers are fantastic, and holy crap they have a lot of people running around.  I would do that California Salad every day if I could.    As for outside seating - its a screened in and roofed outside, no separate exit or anything, but you get the breeze and air which is nice.",

    "text": "First of all this place seems to be the kind of place you would find in Myrtle Beach or Pigeon Forge ... and I mean this in the worst sort of way. We were there on a Saturday morning, looking for a nice place to eat breakfast. This was not it. We stood in line and were finally rushed over to a table that was squeezed between four other tables ... to be honest, I am surprised it meets fire code. This also means that you get bumped by everyone else being rushed out. And rushed you are. The food arrives so quickly, one wonders how they can cook it so quickly .... I guess they are fast with the microwave, great at thawing stuff, and cook as much as possible in advance. So, after waiting around for a while to sit, the server impatiently taps their foot waiting for you to quickly pick something from the menu. Hey, here is a tip: WHY don't you post the menu near the door so that people waiting to get in, can go ahead and make up their minds ... The food is about the same quality as Cracker Barrel, or Bob Evans .... definitely nothing to write home about. The big difference between Cracker / Bob and this place, is that the other two resturants are quieter, and you have more room to sit and to eat. Also, you are not given the bums rush after the food arrives. I mean, my plate was literally whisked away BEFORE I was finished eating. I would have been upset, but the food just was not that good, and so was not worth getting upset over.",

We felt rushed the entire meal as several different servers came up to take our order within a few minutes of being seated and throughout which felt very impersonal (like they wanted to get us out as quickly as possible).

We finally had the chance and everything we ordered was very good.  I thought the pancakes were light and fluffy and had really good flavor and the bacon was really good.  The only drawback for us was a few of the charges.  I ordered the combo and when I was asked how I wanted my egg, I ordered only the egg white.  When the bill came, I was charged an extra $1.99 for my selected style of egg.  I was also surprised at the cost of a kid's juice.  We ordered a kid's plate, which was $5.99 (pretty average price) and the juice charge was $2.99.  So we ended up spending $9 for a 4-year old.  Again, the food was very good and we will likely go back, I just may leave the kids at home.",

    "text": "They've lost the original magic.  We live in Cornelius, NC, about 5 minutes from the original store in Davidson.  Toast was originally one of our favorite places for Sunday brunch when the opened years ago. Apparently it was the favorite of a lot of other people and it quickly out grew the tiny space it occupied on Main Street but they never moved out.  Consequently service at this location suffered. To compensate, they started to open other stores throughout the area.  This one in Tega Cay is one of the more recent additions.  Decided to give it a try since we were in the area yesterday and unfortunately it proved to be a disappontment.    To start with, we were shuttled to the covered patio after being told that we would have to wait if we wanted inside.  We reluctantly agreed and walked by four tables ready to go as we were escorted to our table which fortunately was next to the fireplace. (Remember this is February).  While they were prompt in taking our order and food came out fairly promptly, after that we never saw our server again and had to flag down other servers to get coffee refills and in the end, our check.  My wife said her wrap was OK but my meatload sandwich was very bland with no flavor and the potatoe salad side was so undercooked, the potatoes had a crunch and a raw taste to them.  Service was lacking and the food quality was not there.  That said, this is not an indictment of the whole chain.  The Toast is Dilworth is still run by one of the founders and they have managed to hold onto the qualities that drew us to Toast in the first place.  Hopefully, some of the other expansion locations have manged to hold onto the original princlples and have grown.",

    "text": "My family and I were in town for a wedding and decided to grab breakfast before we head back to our respective cities. I didn't want the typical franchise places since it was our first time visiting this part of SC so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and found this place on Yelp. It was about a 12 minute drive from our hotel which was perfect. Unknowingly, Ive eaten here before but at their Charlotte location wasn't too impressed with the food. We came here on a Sunday and the place was packed. The hostess give us a 30-40 minute wait time so we used some of that time to head to the bar for drinks. They have a good selection of house made cocktails; we ordered a round of Rumosas which is a twist on a Mimosa but with mango. Sounds good right? Well, it actually wasn't. It was too bitter for me. I like sweet. After we got our drinks, we had a seat in their waiting area which is by the entrance. It's roomy, maybe about 8-10 seats. After 15 minutes, our names were called. The server was nice and personable. My sister is from Jax and she shared with us that there's a location in the area. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp n grits w/o sausage. Not a pork fan. Our ordered arrived in about 20 or minutes and unfortunately it came with sausage. The manager I'm assuming was making her rounds to each table so coincidentally to she at ours and apologize for the mistake. I received my replacement in about 5-7 minutes. The dish was average; I've had better. My sister ordered the lobster scramble and I could visibly see the lobster pieces. They didn't skim on that. My other sister ordered French Toast and lastly my dad ordered a basic meal of eggs, toast, sausage and turkey bacon. He ate it all. My nephew had pancakes and potatoes. I stole a few from his plate and they were delish. Seasoned well and there was no need for ketchup. I'm giving them a 3 for taste and the mess of up my order.",

This time as soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by two friendly hostesses who used an app to notify us once our table was ready. Our waiter Colton, was attentive, friendly and great at his job. Our food, just like the last time, was delicious. Our waiter checked on us several times as did the new restaurant manager, Valerie. They had no idea I had written that previous review. Everything was much more organized this time and the traffic in/out of the restaurant flowed nicely.  So happy I gave this spot another try. They impressed us with their service, food, and their willingness to consider customer feedback and take steps to improve. Highly recommend and WILL BE BACK AGAIN!!!",

    "text": "We decided to go check this place out on a Sunday morning and got there around 9:00 a.m.  There was not a wait, but by the time we left, there was a line out the door.  Service was quick, but I'm not sure how I like the random servers flocking to tables once someone needs to order, refill, etc.  It is almost too much.  Kevin ordered the quiche special - cheese, broccoli, bacon, and tomatoes.  It was good, but we both felt we have had better.  The broccoli was flavorful though, I did like that.  I ordered the apple cinnamon flapjacks.  They were okay, the flavor was kind of bland.  I still liked the sweet flavor the pancakes had, but I was really expecting a big kick with apples and cinnamon.  Unfortunately it was not there for either flavor, it was just a small hint.  I also thought there might be chunks of apples in the pancakes, but they failed on that part.  Don't just do a flavoring Toast Cafe, actually have apples in the pancakes!  I will say, it makes it to three stars because they have an excellent value.  It was a lot of food, in fact neither of us finished.  I didn't even come close, I think one pancake with one sausage would have been enough, but instead there were three large pancakes with two sausages.    I'm not sure we will be back as we would prefer to go to Terrace Cafe, but it is an option low on the list for breakfast.",

    "text": "Famous Toastery was one of the first establishments I visited after moving to Charlotte.  I'm a grits fanatic, but the only thing resembling a traditional Southern grit in Hawaii was rice.  They have rice everywhere and look at you dumbfounded when you ask about grits.  \"What's a grit?\"  Now Famous Toastery does understand what a grit is.  They make them not to hot and not to cold.  They're just right.  They even have a fantastic taste that requires very little, if any, additional butter or pepper, let alone cheese.  Grits are not the only southern delicacy in their repetoir. They have a full selection of comfort foods ranging from their Pumpkin Spice Pancakes, which we had in November, to the Greek Omelet with spinich, onion, tomatoes & feta. I had that on Sunday.  I have not ventured much beyond their standard fare.  I've had their toast, some eggs, and a few slices of bacon. We had the hash browns too: although that was more like a roasted potato dish. It was good, but nothing more.  Their eggs Benedict and Florentine are likely part of my future as well as their Buffalo Chicken and Blue Cheese Wrap.  In fact, all of their wraps look and sound delicious.  Although I generally think of this joint as a breakfast stop, their menu is beyond extensive. It's borderline encyclopedic.  From sandwiches and burgers to salads and meatloaf, I think they've covered your pallate.  They even have tofu if you're the sort that prefers to go meatless.  To go orders have been a challenge for me on the occasions I chose not to dine in.   It often takes much longer when you call ahead than waiting to be seated and served.  I live 15 or so minutes away and when I call I'm told it'll take 10 minutes. Unfortunately when I arrive 20 or so minutes later, they are usually still preparing my meal. I've waited as much 15 more minutes at least once after arriving.  That wasn't to my liking. Also things usually get missed on these orders. Didn't get the toast this last go around.  Bummer. Love that toast.  Another challenge with their to go orders is their boxes are paper based. If you're planning to drive somewhere make sure you get there fast. The box falls apart fast: it's like serving steaks on a paper plate in my opinion. I know it's environmentally friendly and all, but by the time I get home the food is just a bit to soggy for my liking.  The omelets are easy to resuscitate on the grill or in the microwave, but potatoes and bread can get messy.  I usually have to put those sorts of things in the toaster oven to drown out the paper taste they absorb.  A good to go box should last at least a half hour in my opinion.    All in all, I give their food a 5. It's great comfort food. They have a lot of choices and I could take all my meals here for a month without trying the same thing twice.  Their service is a 3.  They always seem rushed and that can make for a less enjoyable experience, especially when their is a line of folks waiting to get in.  I'd also say their atmosphere is a solid 4.  It's nice inside and they have a decent waiting area when there's a crowd. They even serve beverages outside while you wait.  If it weren't for the less than stellar to go experiences, I'd rate this place a 4. I think they are a solid 3 for the moment and I'll keep trying them out and update in the future.",

We had ask for the bread that is supposed to be provided at the beginning of the meal, and we had to follow up because our meal was not taken down correctly.  The pancakes were OK.  My boyfriend got the Eggs Benny, and while the overall concept made sense, the execution was a bit lacking. The eggs were cooked great, but the entire dish lacked salt.  The avocados would have been better if they were served in slices since they were really messy.  This place has potential, but overall the service is extremely lacking for the price.",

That said, if you are looking for a fancier country breakfast, this is a great place to start your day. The menu provided enough variety for a family and boasts a certain flair compared to some other local joints.  However, the prices are a bit high. More of a \"brunch\" than breakfast. For a large family, stick to IHOP or Cracker Barrel. The seating arrangement is tricky for parties larger than 4, maybe 5.  On a busy day, like my first Sunday attempt, the staff was a little slack. I'll give them the gloomy outdoor atmosphere but to make tips, at least smile and fill a water. I visited with my boyfriend at the time and he always told me I was too critical of servers. So, I try now to be more understanding. However, the visit does stick out enough that I prefer other restaurants but won't chime in if Toast is the suggestion among friends.  My mom has quite enjoyed her visits for lunch and if she Yelped, many she would have better insight to share and would prove I'm a bit picky.",

What a great idea to keep people warm and caffeinated while they wait! We were lucky enough to be promptly seated. As we were sitting down my boyfriend made a joke about a round of shots and the waitress said we would have to wait 15 minutes. After a weekend of festivities we didn't order any alcohol but found out valuable information - they can serve alcohol after 10am on Sundays. I have lived in NC for 8 years and I am excited at the prospect of having a mimosa one day without having to wait for lunch.   Our visit started with a complimentary round of cornbread and the best apple butter to accompany it. I ordered the lobster scramble and a coffee. The workers here wait on all the tables which meant someone was always circling with water or coffee, or stopping by to check on us. The food arrived freshly and swiftly. My scramble had a generous portion of lobster and cheese with the occasional broccoli incorporated with the eggs. The fruit cup was the perfect pairing and I gave away my toast to my boyfriend. The portion was so large I couldn't finish all of it though I desperately wanted to.   I can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu items.",

I ordered corn beef hash and asked for it to be brown on both sides, the server kept saying crispy and I corrected her twice.  The corn beef hash, which was served as shredded potatoes topped with corn beef, was not good.  There was so much grease that I had to blot it off.  The potatoes and meat were hard, I had to pick through it for the decent parts.  Thankfully I ordered scrambled eggs and English muffin because they were the best things I ate that morning.  I ordered orange juice that tasted like a cross between tangerines and something tangy.  My dining companion had an omelet with grits.  He thought meal was just okay, we both were not satisfied.    I gave three stars because the service was okay and the meal was served in a timely manner.  Also, the ambiance was drab but what made it okay was that we sat on the enclosed patio with ceiling fans on low.",

One cool thing about FT is they have adopted a program where \"every server is your server\" and I think that is very helpful because it doesn't necessarily leave you sitting there waiting on your original server if they 'disappear!'   When it comes to the menu, there is plenty to choose from and typically takes me a bit to decide what I want - even if I roll in thinking I have a slight idea what I'm craving! I haven't really been disappointed by any of the food. Some of the drinks are questionable... my girlfriend ordered the bakon bloody mary and it very confusing how it came out almost 'frozen?' - the crushed I was a weird way to do it... I also ordered a peach bellini (my first) and I didn't necessarily care for it (not sure how to compare to others since it was my first.)  The food is always on point and always fulfilling! There is no walking away hungry. You definitely pay a premium for it, but it comes out as described and I've never had to send anything back - which is always a plus...  Famous Toastery will always be an option as long as I remain in the Charlotte region!",

For the whole experience its 3 stars and for the food its 4 stars, heck 5 stars for the damn delicious Mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice. We only made it the second time we tried going to this place, first time we gave up looking at the line waiting to get a table.  In fact the second time we got seated because we were okay with patio seating.  Weekend morning are crazy busy and the wait time should be crazier I believe. As with any popular, crazy busy restaurant the waiters took their sweet time to attend us at our table and we finally got our water and mimosas came right after few minutes.  One sip and that's it, I had this fresh new perspective of the restaurant LOL. So we ordered our food, I was going with a French toast (Challah bread cinnamon) and wifie is a huge egg benedict fan and she orders that with house potatoes.  Loved my French toast with turkey bacon (not a big fan of turkey bacon is what I realized) but the challah bread was so tasty and had a nice bite.  The French toast wasn't overly sweet unlike some places I have tried before and I loved that mild sweet taste. The egg benedict was looking good and tasted even better,  Eggs were poached perfectly like my wife wanted and those house potatoes, WOW!! All this while I did not realize we were supposed to get complimentary corn bread and butter and only came to know of it when someone asked for it.  Our waiters did not even care to mention about that when she got our orders.  Couldn't hold myself asking to my waitress about it and she replied \"sorry we were out of corn bread today\"  which is obvious but the point was why wasn't we were told about it.  I understand during busy times the hospitality factor goes down a bit, but isn't that what makes it or breaks it ?!",

The servers are very friendly and attentive throughout your whole meal, not just up until the food is delivered. This restaurant uses a model that every server is your server so there is always someone available should you need anything or have any questions.     Now for the food: everything that  I've gotten has been excellent! I really enjoy the flapjacks and of all the flavors the chocolate chip and raspberry walnut are by far my favorite. The stuffed French toast with strawberries is also delicious and each of those comes with a generous side of thick sliced bacon.      Finally, the coffee is some of the best I've ever had. it's a dark roast which I don't normally like but it is amazing. Overall the meal is well worth the money for the quality and experience!",

The staff was very nice and attentive. I like that everybody is pretty much your server so you can ask anyone for help. The ambiance was pretty good - A little rustic/cottage-y vibe.  My issue with this place was that it was really expensive- especially for items that shouldn't be. It was like $12 or $14 for a turkey sandwich. Is this Tom Brady's personal turkey they're serving? And it only came with chips I believe. I feel a $14 turkey sandwich should come with a side of a cheeseburger that comes with a side of fries. And a pickle. I have a friend who is very well off and even she was like \"they're so expensive.\" I ended up having biscuits and gravy since it was the cheapest thing they had that could be considered a meal. My wife got a sandwich and she said it was ok. The biscuits and gravy were actually really good but not good enough to want to come back.   I can see how this is one of a few places that you can have a quality breakfast/brunch in the area, so maybe that's why they're always packed? That and they do have great service.",

Everything you get is fantastic. My go to is the avocado, bacon, and parmesan omelet. It is always tasty and made with big chunks of avocado. The lobster rolls are a must have as well, especially with the cucumber salad.

    "text": "Update 5.26.18 Definitely sliding down... The food is 'okay' (presentation and quality have gone down some - slab of quiche, thin pancake syrup, tons of separate plates on a tiny table for eggs, pancakes, grits, etc.) and the front of the house needs a major overhaul and retraining. The last few times we have been the wait staff has been confused at best. Today we sat for 15 minutes and finally flagged down a busboy to ask someone to wait on us; he said he would but proceeded to start cleaning off a table first. So I went inside and asked the hostess to send a server. When she came, she asked for our drink order and I told her we'd been waiting and were ready to order. I got a quiche and when she and the other server brought out food, mine was missing. I thought she went back to get it and my bf didn't get any syrup for his pancakes plus I needed another drink. When I flagged her down to ask if my food was coming a while later, she said, \"yeah, they made the wrong quiche\"... ok, thanks for telling me?! Every time we asked for anything we literally had to flag someone down. We had one guy ask us how we were doing after we were served. Also, I'm not sure it isn't a health code violation the way some servers carry the food and for a server to have long fake nails on the edge of your plate. Not sure we will be back for a while, too many other options. Definitely not worth the $. When I checked out, the little girl at the register asked, \"How was everything?\" so I said, to be honest, it's gone downhill. We were seated for quite a while and I had to come back in to flag down a server.\" All she said was, \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  Again, this is not the first time we felt the service was lax but after this visit we verbally confirmed to each other we probably won't be back.",

Got the 3 egg breakfast with toast and potatoes.  It came out in about 5 mins(alarming to me) The eggs were decent. The potatoes were cold, flavorless, mushy outside and hard inside(undercooked and had been sitting) The toast was cool to the touch too. Coffee was menh.  I head up to pay my bill.. It was around 11 bucks or so, I paid with 15. The cashier instead of handing my change to me just asks if I want to put the rest in the tip jar... I was going to leave the tip but that isnt how you do it. She mustve seen my face and started to correct herself but I just let it ride and chalked it up to a loss.  Now I did go later but they serve breako all day.. My three servers were decent so no complaints about that.  Just the food.",

Sausage gravy is nice and creamy. Grits are a little runny but it's not a deal breaker. Perfect eggs, fluffy biscuits. It is a tad cramped but at the same time it's nice to see a place thrive so it's easily able to be looked over. Really wish the entrance and exit wasn't through one door. It's challenging to get in and out. Again, easily able to be looked over. I'd choose this over IHOP every day!",

My comment was on the pancake itself. I did not realize I needed to request my pancake flavor to be mixed in. If I would have ordered chocolate chip pancakes, are the chips just sprinkled on top?    And as far as the sausage patties go, they ARE the exact same as McDonalds sausage. As stated, my daughter even agreed but she actually LIKES McDonalds sausage so she knows EXACTLY what it tastes like. I also said that it was replaced for me. I did speak to a manager. That's who replaced the sausage! Yes. I explained it tasted like McDonalds.    I did not swoop into your restaurant to write a bad review. We WANTED to have a good experience. I'm being honest in my critics and experience. Sometimes it can offend as it seems to have you. But I did try to rectify some of it with a manager and it was handled well. No attitude or remarks. It was not taken personally. Just an apology and resolved. By the time we got to the pancake, it wasn't worth it to say anymore. I paid our entire bill, without incident or holding up other customers, and we left.       Please remember that if you come across another displeasing critic, just apologize and try to resolve it. Maybe invite us back for a 2nd chance. The way you handled my review is the reason a lot of people won't go to a manager for resolutions.",

One , didn't know we could seat ourselves , had to ask because no one greeted myself or my coworker . Picked a table in the corner on the backside of the restaurant, waited a good ten minutes before anyone came to serve us. I saw 2 waiters pass us by 3 times and no one smiled , asked if we needed help, notttthhing. Finally, a nice lady asked if we had anyone help us, noticed her section was on the other side so I'm still wondering why the tall, Ken Barbie wannabe didn't wait on us and we were obviously in his section .   I absolutely despise bad customer service . These 2 stars are solely for the nice server that did take care of us .   I ordered the smoked sausage omelet, eh ... no flavor , tasted like carton eggs and it was a bit cold . Wheat toast was burnt , fruit smelled funny (yes, it had an odor) so I didn't eat it . Also ordered a Cobb salad to go bc I knew that little $11 omelet would have my tummy growling by 3pm ... What's going on Famous Toast? Nothing taste the same . My coworker however enjoyed her special ... so I don't know did I not order the right meals ? Doesn't even matter when you aren't acknowledged in the first place .  Won't be visiting this location again ,  cost too much for the negative experience, and bland food .",

I wouldn't say it's the best thing I've ever had but it was refreshing and a healthier option. When they served it, they mixed up our orders a little bit but it wasn't a big deal. $13 for the avocado Benedict",

Two ordered the lobster scramble special while the rest of our group ordered off the regular menu. We were all pleased with our meals. The staff was friendly and attentive. My only complaint is by the 5th time we were asked how everything was it was a little much while we were trying to enjoy our meal and have conversation. By the time we left there were people even waiting outside. If you are trying to go on a Sunday the earlier the better! Overall, we were pleased with the food and the great service given.",

The waitlist system is pretty cool (you can see where you are in line and are tested when your table is ready). Once you are seated is where the problems start. The acoustics are terrible between the reverberated conversations of the whole room and the music (why??), you cant have a conversation without yelling. The prices are pretty high (which would be fine if the quality of the food matched). I have ordered eggs Benedict twice. The first time the eggs were cooked all the way solid (is hard boiled egg and very wrong). I gave it another shot several month later and this time the yellow was runny (good) but so Were the whites (or should I say clears). Getting a coffee refill was difficult.  We only wanted one and had to flag down another waiter for help. Also There always seems to be a wait even though there are always open tables. Short staffed? The staff were all super nice just the ambiance, food, and prices leave a bit to be desired. Or we had bad luck the 4 plus times that we tried it...",

I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy.  This dish literally makes you want to pick up the bowl and lick it,until of course you realize you are at a busy restaurant.

My sister got the pancakes which tasted more like raw flour than chocolate chips.

    "text": "Really liked the atmosphere.  the first time I went I ordered a traditional eggs, sausage bacon breakfast.  It was ok, hard to mess that sort of thing up.  Price was high however.  Second time I ordered the french toast.  Man, I gotta tell ya, that is when you get the gist of a place.  When you don't cook the toast enough and you start putting your own little twist to it.  That's when a place blows it.  French toast is pretty much eggs, some cream or milk and bread.  There isn't anything else though you can have a separate cinnamon version.  So, I guess I like a traditional American breakfast.  I don't want California influences or European tripe when I sit down for a good American belly full of breakfast.  Again, the price was ridiculously high.  'A' for atmosphere.",

Servers were attentive and kind to the baby who was kept occupied with a blank kids menu and crayons. My French toast was delicious and didn't even need syrup. Husband's omelette was cooked perfectly - not just a mess of scrambled eggs. Coffee was tasty. Prices are a bit on the high side... Paid $75 for 4 meals and coffee (including the tip). Totally worth it!",

    "text": "We haven't been to this location in over a year.  One and COMPLETELY done.  Why?  Because of the way they treated us, right out of the hospital, no less.  My daughter had just been through an endoscopy and had not eaten for almost sixteen hours.  We went to this restaurant based on someone's recommendation.  We were one of only three groups in the restaurant on a weekday; another family and a couple were the only other customers there.  What a thrill it was to see the servers, ours included, spend every single moment they could catering to the family right beside us, while it took us twenty minutes just to get a stupid drink order.  Want toast, Other Family?  Done.  Want jelly?  Done.  Extra orange juice?  My pleasure!  Need me to cut your sausage?  Absolutely.  And what about us, the only other family in the joint?  \"We'll get to you in a minute.\"  In this place where \"everyone is your server\" we couldn't TACKLE a server to help us.  I'm guessing it's because we were in jeans and t-shirts and the other family was dressed like Stepfords, but we had no intention to wear our suits and dress clothes to the hospital, so excuse us for our state of dress (sarcasm intended.)  I wanted to leave, but my daughter was so hungry I figured we needed to wait it out.  When we finally got our food, instead of being presented to us like the other table, they literally threw it at us, bumping our drinks which had not been (or would be) refilled.  Imagine my surprise when we were served tiny servings of food we could have easily gotten at Cracker Barrel for a lot cheaper and a LOT friendlier.  We ate what we could, I fetched some to-go boxes myself (because I didn't want to wait an hour for the servers to drag themselves away from the Stepfords to do it) and we packed up to go.  And your lousy ten-percent tip?  Not the norm, since we usually tip twenty to twenty-five percent, but we don't pay for a fat lot of nothing.  I lodged a complaint but never heard back, so that pretty much proved to me just how little they cared for our patronage.  For the record, I did give the Indian Land location a shot and it was a lot nicer.  And I didn't have to dress like a Stepford to be treated decently.",

It looks like a renovated fast food building, but the service is awesome and the food is great. The wait at 10 am on Saturday was only a few minutes, and they've got classics and some more interesting items on the menu. I had an avocado omelet, which I thought was pretty good considering I would have never thought to mix avocado and eggs. Portion sizes are pretty large, so the food is good and you're definitely getting what you pay for. Would definitely recommend for friends!",

    "text": "We have been coming to Toast since they opened, and unfortunately, I think the quality of the food--and the size of the portions--has decreased. We usually order one of the lobster items, like the lobster Benedict. We loved Toast, from the service to the ingredients in the food to the sides, like the cucumber salad. However, the last two times we were in, our hashbrowns servings were so small, they almost felt like half-orders. And, they were cold--I mean REALLY cold. Even the size of the eggs seemed small, compared to what we were used to. And while before the lobster chunks were truly chunks, our last visits were more like tiny bits sprinkled in the Hollandaise. the sliced tomatoes were mushy--it was just meh overall. Part of what made Toast truly great was the portion size--if I wanted tapas, I'd be eating tapas. For breakfast or lunch/brunch, I tend to save my calories so I can indulge in large, comforting servings, and Toast always delivered there. The menu prices supported the large sizes, and we were okay with walking out of there spending almost fifty dollars on an amazing breakfast. The service is always good, I will say that. It's great you don't have to hunt for \"your\" server but can ask questions of anyone. The serving staff remains outstanding. It's become inconsistent regarding if you are offered cornbread, which used to just come with your meal without inquiring. I don't know if the place just got too popular or what, but I'm not sure we'll be back again--the items we prefer are pricey, and if the portions we experienced this time are their new normal, it's too much money for the food on your plate. So sad...we will miss it, but we're not sure if we're willing to try again for the price.",

    "text": "People love brunch and Famous Toastery is a local chain serving up brunch daily. This Tega Cay location is always busy. Of course I've only been on the weekend which is their busiest days, I imagine. We've had anywhere between a 15 and 45 minute wait when we've gone. There's a small waiting area and they do put coffee outside while you wait.   Staff always seems friendly. It's the type of place where everyone is your server so you can grab anyone if you need something. Even with this concept, sometimes it's hard to catch someone. Be sure to ask for the complimentary corn bread and jam. Sometimes the server brings it automatically and others you have to ask. It is delicious.  As far as the menu goes, there's your typical breakfast items: breakfast plates, omelettes, eggs Benedict, pancakes and french toast. They also have salads, sandwiches, wraps and burgers if you're in the mood for that. There's also daily specials and of course drinks. I'm a fan of the food and that's why I keep on coming back and there's healthy options too. Some of my favorites are the crab cake Benedict or hash. Those potatoes are out of this world! My husband loves the peanut butter and banana stuffed french toast and my best friend loves the huevos rancheros.   When it first opened, food seemed to come out pretty fast. Over the last year, it's been slower. On my most recent trip, it was about 30 minutes to get our food. And once mine came out, it was the wrong quiche. I ordered the spinach one and got the sausage one instead. It was a quick fix. A manager came over to apologize. She explained there were new cooks and the kitchen was backed up. She also took 50 percent off our bill which was super nice. I appreciated the explanation and understand things happen. The rest of the service was fine. Hopefully the kitchen will get back in their groove and get the food moving out quicker.   This is one of our favorite places and definitely one of my overall favorites for breakfast, lunch or brunch in the area",

Additionally, I had misposted a poor review on Famous Toastery that should have been posted on the new First Watch on 160.  The manager, Jason, handled this very diplomatically and kindly.  I am very impressed with the management, the service and the food.  Thank you!",

Warning you will have to wait for tables even if they are empty, but enjoy some of the complementary coffee and hang out for a bit while they do their thing. This wait was easier once I knew what to expect.   This is our second review; because our first was not the best, so the owner reached out and asked for us to try it again.  He gave us compensation and some incentive.   The food:  Ruben with chips- \"good, nice, and sloppy! plenty of everything. The chips are chips. \" Kids Pancakes with eggs, cup of fruit- \"good, it was fine. Gave me too much. They gave me syrup; because they did not have Nutella \" Mac and cheese-  \" delicious, but I had to wait for a spoon\" Runners omelette- I am glad I got it. Not a huge fan of the turkey meat inside. I really enjoyed the vegetables. I loved how crispy the cabbage was and it was tasty in the omelette. I would order it again and next time just ask for double Brie and hold the turkey.   The food came out super QUICK! We did have to ask and waiter for silverware to eat it and again our server was hard to gain their attention.",

We visited early on a Saturday, ahead of the rush. After a short wait, we were seated and promptly served a bowl of cornbread with a fruit chutney. The cornbread was a little dry, but the chutney was delicious and we ate all of it.  Our server asked had we been there before and explained a team approach service. My wife ordered chocolate chip pancakes, bacon and an order of eggs over easy. All cooked perfect.  I ordered an avocado omelette. It was large and nicely filled with a delicious mix of avocado, tomato, bacon & parmesan cheese. For cup of fresh fruit of nice. I also appreciate there are plenty of choices for toast, not just the standard white or wheat. Had a hard timing finishing my breakfast but it was so good I wanted to eat all of it. Also, the coffee is excellent. Dark and strong but not bitter.  We look forward to coming back.",

I know this is a minor detail, but they need to fix this especially after the manager told me: \"we are aware of this.

Within 10 minutes of being sat we were asked at least five times if we were ready to order (we were not obviously, because I just sat, we were catching up and we also each had children under the age of two to tend to!). Once we finally did order we weren't really checked on but at least there are many waitstaff walking by. However having said this, the food did come out rather fast and my chicken sandwich was positively delicious. The pasta salad I ordered was kind of bland and my friend ordered the kids mac & cheese for her 1.5 year-old and it appeared to be kraft.

Huge chunks of lobster, shredded lettuce and a whisper of mayo on a delish buttered roll. On the side was a cucumber salad with diill and a light dressing.  Simple and fresh. The food showed up very quickly and the waitstaff were attentive but not hovering. We met the owners previously at their Ballantyne location and she was there today greeting customers.

    "text": "For the lunch break of my second day of work ever, my girlfriend and I decided to try The Toast Cafe, which I had heard about from a compelling newspaper review. She had been before in Charlotte and the Davidson area, but this particular one was going to be a new experience for us both. As opposed to Father's Day, when it was predictably packed and impossible to obtain a table, the Tuesday lunch hour provided a lull for accessibility. She had already gotten a table and water by the time I arrived, shortly after she did. I ordered a club sandwich, and she got a Western Omelette. I was surprised and impressed by how quickly the food arrived at our table after we ordered. Hers looked good, and mine tasted great. As opposed to many club sandwiches, which are unwieldy and almost unmanageable in their size, this one was just about perfect for an afternoon meal. Her side hash browns looked incredible. The potato salad was pretty decent, but it wasn't terribly remarkable. I could've done with an option for French fries or maybe soup/salad. No big deal there though. The sandwich was the star of this show, and it delivered. She said the omelette was excellent as well. The atmosphere is very nice, casual and laid back, and there is porch seating for fresh air as well. One thing: it is kind of confusing when dealing with staff because their policy is apparently that every waiter is your waiter. While this can be helpful for both patrons and staff members, it does kind of take away from the personal touch one may usually find at other restaurants. Overall though, it was a great experience. I imagine we'll be back there soon.",

    "text": "Went to Toast for the first time this morning.  Soooooo glad they have opened, as there are precious few breakfast places in these parts.  The menu is full of variety, so we'll be able to find something new every time!  The pace of the kitchen is good, and we were not waiting too long at all for food.  Presentation was nice.  Everything is freshly made and not processed, but prices are pretty high.  My spinach, mushroom and gruyere quiche (on the special menu) was about $10.  A fair portion with a small bowl of fresh fruit and baby lettuce/tomato wedge garnish, but I was still a little hungry when I was done. My husband's \"Avocado Benedict\" (unusual open-faced whole avocado with cheese, egg and pico di gallo, no bread) was $13+.  The complimentary cornbread with apple spread when we sat down was a nice touch, but in general the entrees are overpriced by $1-2.  I didn't try the coffee.  My husband and brother-in-law said it was 'okay'.  Funny that the most expensive thing on the menu (as we calculated from a food quantity perspective) was the item namesake of this restaurant!  Ha!  A 'side' of toast is one lonely piece of toast and I think costs $1.29 or something like that.  Really?......    The best thing about this place is the True team service.  It's nice to know you can wave down any of the smiling servers and get whatever you need.  Amazing also with this approach that although we felt well cared for we didn't feel smothered.  Good job on this training, Toast!    Ambience isn't bad, a little loud.  This is a family restaurant with apparently no shortage of high chairs.  We definitely hit toddler hour.    I don't know how things go day to day, but I will say this: Get here early.  They go on a wait fairly early and I would suspect are busy all day.  They do not take reservations.  If you do have to wait, though, you can do it in the comfort of a screened porch and the folks at Toast put out a little free coffee to tide you over until you sit down.  So nice!",

    "text": "Ate Sunday brunch here yesterday. The food is usually pretty good but today was not the case. May be partly our fault (or not) because we came at 2:30 and they close at 3. We usually try not to go to restaurants near closing time out of respect for employees and the food is usually not as good. In this case we knew what we wanted and ordered pretty much immediately after sitting down. The food however was not the food I'm used to from Toast. My breakfast was just OK overall and the potatoes were luke warm and kinda hard. I didn't send them back for new ones because of the time and just took one to the chin being we came so late. I will probably never come so late again unless pressed to do so. The service, as always was good and food is usually the same. I will go back.",

It came with a meat and eggs to my liking. Of course I did sausage as I don't eat bacon. It also came with eggs which I had scrambled with cheese. So delicious, the eggs weren't dry while I like. Also, I recommend getting the mimosas. It literally comes to the rim of the glass and taste so good. It's a little loud inside which is fine with me. Also, I wasn't exactly sure how to get in as it looked like a insulated patio. (Tip, it's the side door, lol) toast is fantastic and I highly recommend. I will definitely return!",

Was told it came with herbed mayo... Pretty sure it was just regular old mayo... The avocado was half brown  and sliced but all clumped together in one section ... Over all horribly thrown together  with no care! The pasta salad it came with looked like pesto but it literally just tastes like plain pasta... And the pasta was way over cooked... Ordered an additional side of fruit... Out of the whopping 6 pieces in the container only the two pieces of pineapple were any good!   The French toast was okay... The scrambled eggs were okay....The hash browns were clearly cut like homefries but under the supervision of the less than mediocre cook who must've been angry.. They arrived half chunked half smashed up... Nasty!   This was the worst toast experience to date. Won't be coming back!!   When you're paying $40 for 2 people you expect to be extremely pleased with the food you've ordered! But instead we are so utterly dissatisfied  *Maybe a manager can go babysit the kitchen and make sure all orders are well put together and not ruined*",

If you like them on Facebook they usually put out coupons every month or so for buy one meal get one 1/2 off or 20% of your meal or some other type of coupon and those really make a visit worth it! My husband and I go here for brunch every weekend when we have a coupon and absolutely love sitting outside by the fire. The servers are all so nice and the manager is also a hard worker and very cheerful and kind! My husband usually get the blueberry chocolate chips pancakes and I get the strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast with bacon and it's to die for! The coffee is also fresh and the waiters are wonderful about making sure you have a full cup. We have never ever had a bad experience and always recommend this restaurant to others! The food portions are wonderful, the service is super quick, and the kind staff always make for an enjoyable experience! I would always choose Famous Toastery over IHOP or Cracker Barrel!",

I can't stress enough how good the coffee is. I had The Usual omelet which was sausage cheese and onion. It came with stone ground grits and toast. Before the food came the server brought two slices of cornbread with apple butter. Yum! I was only disappointed with the side of bacon. It had good flavor but it was soft and a little cold.    It is a little pricey... My one meal cost $20 with tip. For breakfast that's a bit much but considering the quality of the food, I guess you get what you pay for.

I only took off a star because the service is hit or miss. More misses than hits but the food quality makes up for it. Lobster omelette has large chunks of lobster meat, simply delicious. I've had a variety of the French toast, pancakes and salad wraps, all were great, yummy and super fresh. Food quality is always good just the service staff doesn't seem well trained in using the iPads, which are a recent addition and for another example, my sister ordered a Lobster omelette and they gave her a southwest omelette. The waitress never came and apologized but another member of the staff corrected the concern. There might be a wait during busy times but the food is worth the Wait.  Enjoy just bring your patience. Signed with Disappointment and Calories, The Original Charlestonian #LEWReviews  Update: I took off another star as after speaking with the company. They quote stated that they are \"sorry that I feel that service wasn't exceptional\". Further justifying that service is their priority. Ummm well unfortunately it wasn't on the several occasions that I've been and will be encouraging my family to not go again. It is clear by their clear disregard of my bad experiences, repeat...I've been and gotten poor service on multiple occasions, they aren't focused on customer service.",

I really don't like the constantly changing server model because you are always waiting on a refill or a check.  I've eaten there twice now.  Sausage is horrible.  Its a large flat rubber patty resembling a drink coaster, with very little taste.  I expect a flavorful sausage for a place that charges me this much.  The home fried potatoes are excellent and are my favorite.  To me the rest is just bland.",

The ham they used was of poor quality, very chewy and had a lot of gristle. My husband's eggs in his New Yorker were watery, and his toast came out with no butter on it & it was burnt.  Although our service was reasonable (she came to take our order in a reasonable amount of time)-she never refilled my coffee, and did not refill my husbands water once. For this place getting 4.5 out of 5 stars, we were quite let down. And for us paying $30 for just two of us to eat brunch, it was not a good deal for our $$.",

I'm not that far away...as in...Rock Hill...but I won't likely travel to frequent this breakfast location.  Why not?  Well, the food isn't as spectacular as some are making it out to be.  Don't get me wrong, it's good...just not as good as what we have near my house.  What do you mean?  The hash...the main component of the dish ordered...just not good.  Very little corned beef.  Just sort of plain tasting.  The biscuit.  Are these premade?  Your gravy tasted great...the biscuit?  Not so much.  So why four stars?  The ambiance, the decor, the service...all five stars.  The rest of the food was pretty decent as well.  Nothing I'm writing home about....but still good.  If I lived near Toast, I'd likely give it many tries as I like the potential.  TBH, this place will thrive due to its location and the fact that they have some uppity sounding dishes on the menu.  They're a perfect fit for the local community.  Try:  Their bacon...they cook it perfectly  Avoid:  The corned beef hash",

    "text": "Finally! I've been dying for a good breakfast place to make its way to Fort Mill/Tega Cay, and Toast has filled the niche beautifully.   The fella and I ventured in on a Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m., and the joint was jumpin'. We were afraid there'd be a long wait since there were quite a few people siting in the waiting area (which is pretty large), but the bar was almost empty, so we bellied right up. A waitress got us drinks and sweet cornbread with apple butter almost right away.  As their menu says, every server is your server, which can be awesome or awful, and they lean more towards the awesome side. Our service was solid, and the food was good with large portions. It's rare that I can get full off granola/yogurt/berries, but that's exactly what happened this morning. The fella ordered two eggs over-medium, grits, sausage patties, and toast, and he said the eggs were good but not great, but the potatoes - which he got instead of grits - were pretty delicious.  There are still a few kinks to work out - it seemed like there was an army of servers (maybe too many?) this morning, and although the fella ordered grits, he got potatoes and didn't feel like making a fuss about it - but all in all, Toast is a much-needed, delicious option in the neighborhood!",

This place is pretty cool, they have a half inside/outside area which is nice. The food was pretty good. I got the rasberry walnut flapjacks which were good but they were a little sweet so I couldn't finish it. The hash potatoes were DELICIOUS though. I loved them. They are the cubed style potatoes and they are seasones perfectly. This place is a great breakfast place.",

I'm not a big fan of everyone is your waitress, because as soon as you sit , 5 people will ask if you're ready to order . I also think it's also a bit overpriced as my omelet and coffee were over $15 without tip and to me that's a lot for one person for breakfast.",
