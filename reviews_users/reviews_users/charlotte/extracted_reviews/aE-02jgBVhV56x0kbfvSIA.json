I had heard it was hard to know when building your own bowl what was included in the price and what was extra.  But, I was told, the white dishes are add-ons.  I had the grain bowl (1/2 jasmine rice and 1/2 couscous), feta, tzatzki, chickpea salad, tomato/cucumbers, red cabbage and added beets and chicken.  Delicious!!  Everything was fresh and packed with flavor!  We also had 1/4 chicken with two sides (potatoes and tomato/olives).  Moist chicken and the potatoes needed absolutely nothing, they were that good!  The cilantro sauce is drinkable, it's that good.  Last, the shawarma wrap with a side of brussel sprouts, again amazing!  Next time I will get a mezze plate because the vegetables are flavorful and everything I could ever need.  Can't wait to try the falafel, too!  I was beyond impressed with Yafo.  Thrilled to have food in Charlotte that is outside of the bland box!",

    "text": "great review of this new place in charlotte agenda on monday so 16 yr old daughter and i went to try it out. i wanted to love it. i got to meet Frank Scibelli, the owner. I have always liked his other restaurants. i ended up just liking it. I thought it was a little odd that no side items come with it. i ordered the marrakesh lamb wrap for $12.99. the flavor was good. it would just be nice to have a little scoop of rice or couscous as a side. daughter ordered a wrap and ordered a side of rice and it was 2.99 for a side of rice. a little pricey for what you get.  we came up to the door on the Earth Fare side and it was locked. we had to walk through the patio construction to get to the unlocked door.  lastly, to get from the dining room to the restroom, you have to walk through the people waiting in line to order. it would have made more sense to put the restroom in the dining room area. the food is good, worth a try.",

We were in Israel (tel aviv) last spring and an Israeli told us he is a wonderful chef and had a restaurant in Tel Aviv until he came tot he US..  I really liked it and you can combine proteins like lamb, kibbeh, etc with all the wonderful salads, baba, and a huge variety of other things along with some nice beers.  I would definitely go back.  My husband on the other hand gave it a 2 and did not like it.  I think he was spoiled by the Israeli food and did not think it was authentic enough.  I will go back though.",

I just think that ordering process is a little overwhelming. When I first got in line, I figured out what I wanted, but there was no menu board listing the sides, I actually ended up looking them up on my phone while waiting to order so I would know what's what. The staff are very nice, but I think they need to start asking customers if it's their first time at the restaurant or not before they order, the person helping me had to repeat themselves a few times because I wasn't sure what they were asking. They forgot to give me any laffa bread with any of my items, I even heard the cashier ask for some, get no response, and then just give up and tell me to have a nice day so she could speed the line along. I think if the ordering process could be a little more streamlined, then this place really would be a real gem. Maybe I'll just try ordering online next time.",

I have been probably over 10 times and I have never had a pleasant experience with the staff. Today was no exception. It is a busy restaurant because the food is great, but the process here is so terrible. It's like the line employees have never been instructed on what to do or how to keep things moving. Communication in this place is bad and only seems to get worse. They finally put labels on their toppings which should have helped but didn't seem to help at all. I've waited this long to write a review because I was hoping the service would improve with time but they really need help. Take notes from the process and service and speed at Chipotle or literally anywhere honestly. I guarantee I'll be back soon because of the falafel bowl but I won't enjoy interacting with the staff. Also since when do y'all charge for pine nuts??",

    "text": "Visited for the first time on a Sunday after church after hearing a segment on this new restaurant on the radio earlier this week.  Yafo is a great option for fast, fresh, and tasty food.  There is tons of variety on the menu, which is one of the beauties of this type of cuisine.  We wanted to taste everything!  However, the variety, can also be very confusing.  It is set up similar to the Mexican \"fast food\" chains like Chipotle and Qdoba - you make your selections (hummus bowl, salad, wrap, etc.) at the counter and move along down the line choosing toppings, accompaniments, proteins, sides, etc.  There is a menu posted above that you can reference, in addition to a chalk board listing the day's \"mezzes.\"  The only thing is, if it's your first time there, it can be overwhelming to know what is what - what you're allowed to put on what, what you're exactly getting with what you ordered, or what is an uncharge and what isn't.  We didn't want to hold up the line too much by asking too many questions so we ordered what looked good and was surprised by the uncharges on some of our items that we weren't clear would be upcharges. Once we sat down, we grabbed one of their printed menus to take a closer look and better understand how it all works which was somewhat helpful...I'm thinking they may have a few kinks to iron out in this system to maybe simplify things or make it clearer what goes with what or how to build your particular hummus bowl/salad/wrap.  I definitely wouldn't want to see it get over simplified like Chipotle where you only have X-number of choices, but some clarification would definitely be helpful.    Overall, the food was tasty and again, there's a great variety to choose from.  As for authenticity - I would say the proteins in particular are not your typical Middle Eastern style.  The \"beef kofta\" is more like a meatball in a red tomato sauce.  Tasty for sure, but not what you'd expect for kofta.  The lamb is more like pulled pork in texture, which is disappointing when you see the beautiful roast on the spit in the kitchen.  But again, it tasted good.    We would definitely visit again, especially now that we understand the menu a little better.",

It was totally empty when we got here and I decided to have a bowl with rice, hummus, falafel and salad. My husband had a lamb wrap to go. While I thoroughly enjoyed my bowl I will say that I had to use a lot of the sauces which had been kindly given to us on the side (tahini, coriander dressing and a habanero) in order for it to be truly delicious... the falafel was small and crunchy and the hummus was tasty. I'd give it 4/5. My husband didn't really enjoy the lamb, saying it didn't have much taste and he didn't care for it being pulled rather than typical gyro style - he is extremely fussy though... the price was pretty ridiculous however, $26, the portion is generous but I don't think the price is justified. I also expected to get bread on the side with my bowl, but didn't... I used a wrap from home instead",

I mean you can get their Greek yogurt Mac and cheese as a side along with the healthy choices of roasted cauliflower, mixed veggies, and their soup du jour.

Two massive scoops of hummus, and lots of options for add-ins. We opted for fresh tomatoes, roasted red peppers, purple cabbage, chick peas, and a little quinoa. The bowl was big enough to split, unless you're starving.   The staff behind the counter was great and despite a line at lunch time, they were able to answer any questions we had and gave great suggestions.   Will be back!",

    "text": "So good! Really really good! We went on a Friday night around 8:00 figuring they wouldn't be too busy and boy, were we wrong! We waited in line for 20 minutes. Being that this was our first time, we didn't exactly know what to expect. I felt alimony as if we were in line to eat at a cafeteria. We looked at the menu while in line and kept changing our minds as to what to order. One negative is that they do not have their sides- or mezzes as they call the listed. So one we got up to order, we had to ask what they had for mezze and they answered us with the response that everything is considered a mezze. That caused us to hold up the line longer and that was a bit of a negative to me. Who wants to make a rushed decision in ordering food?? Our food was well with the wait but costly. We paid $60 for four of us to eat and that is without alcohol. After standing in a cattle call line and cafeteria style service, that's a hard pill to swallow for a quick service restaurant!!  Will we return? Sure, but I think that we will be more vigilant as to what we are ordering so we don't have another crazy bill.",

I've been twice during this past holiday season and depending on the day or time, the line could be out the door. Fortunately, it's fast casual enough to where you can find a seat by the time you get your food. The portions are hefty even if the price is a bit high (if you add meat). But you can get some healthy or non-healthy options to fulfill the Mediterranean cravings.  Managers seem to check on you in the dining room and have all been very nice to make sure you got what you need. Interior is clean, open and vibrant. The flavors aren't as deep as Jasmine Grill on South Boulevard, but the ambience, service, and area trump it.",

With so many choices and great looking food it was a tough choice.  We arrived shortly after 11:30 and the line moved well, a total of 5 min wait.  My falafel wrap was amazing and the potatoes on the side were very tasty.  The kids chicken and rice bowl was huge and more than enough for my daughter.  We loved the decor though the napkins blended in which took a minute to spot.  Great food, friendly service, and plenty of additional options to try on our next visit!",

Fortunately we had some from vegetarian friends visit, so we thought that would be a good time to try Yafo since they have a lot of potions for non meat eaters and carnivores alike. Most of us tried the create your own bowl. It is basically Chipotle with mediterranean food, but with way more options. I mean tons of ingredients. Plus they put extra attention to make sure each ingredient is prepared right. Unlike other create your places where you get more variety than quality, you get both at yafo. Prices range from 9-15$ but the portions are quite large. We'll definitely be going back soon.",

Upon entering, you are welcomed by a comfortable seating area adjacent to a walk through, counter ordering system, similar to a Chipotle. Being unfamiliar with Mediterranean delicacies, my questions were welcomed and answered kindly by the first employee in the ordering chain. Options ranged from bowls to wraps to rotisserie chicken with sides called \"mezzes\". I chose a very Americanized meal with 1/4 rotisserie chicken, seasoned rice, and Mac and cheese; of note, the Mac and cheese was created with a slightly different flavor which made the cheese flavor pop even more. Other options that come to mind were couscous, potatoes, and many other specialty side items. Lamb and steak were also other main meat choices. My colleagues selected very traditional dishes, all of which looked very appealing. The variety of colors seem to make the order aesthetically pleasing, yet even more tasty. At the end of the line, Nutella balls await to top off the meal as well as a choice of bread for the table. Beverage options included beer, sodas, or a selection of organic/herbal teas.  This restaurant is a great option to become a weekday staple or a new flavorful adventure. While a specialty restaurant, there's something here for the whole family.",

We could not resist the brussel sprouts after reading several reviews and we were not disappointed (actually they were outstanding!).  The servings are quite large (ate our fill and had enough left over for dinner the next night).    You cannot go wrong - fresh, healthy food with a friendly service.  Perhaps my only complaint - because this place is so good, it gets crowded - not an issue for the line as it moves fast, but not a lot of places to sit down and eat, so be willing to get it to go.  Tastes just as good at home as it does in the restaurant.  Enjoy!",

We did not know that Mezzes were side which turned out to be some really good looking veggies lime Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and more. We kept it simple, she had the chicken shawarma over a bed of quinoa and jasmine rice and added more to the bowl such as the baba ghanoush , onions, what looked to be garlic and chopped cilantro. I order the beef kofta shawarma and added everything on the line I could over a bed of Jasmine Rice. We both took our first bites and instantly knew we found a winner to return too. The beef had a great flavor and mixed with the baba ghanoush and all the other additives was an explosion of well blended flavors. The same was said with my girlfriend's chicken shawarma. The staff was friendly and very efficient in clearing trays and trash off tables. We sat outside on a mildly  warm night which made our experience much better. Next time we are there we will definitely try the mezzes and split a shawarma bowl.",

The restaurant is very much still in its early growing stages - I came around 7pm to grab dinner and waited a line of 10ish people for 25 minutes. The line moves slowly since there is only 1 person per each station (i.e. one server for rice/salad, one server for toppings, one server for sides, and one server for meats). This will probably be improved once the staff gets a hang of things but at this point it means you choose your base and then wait a few minutes while the person in front of you chooses their toppings, etc.  I got the impression that the Mezze/Toppings change often, but it was difficult to see what the Mezze/Toppings were since they were handwritten in a chalk board above the lettuce/salad fridge. I would recommend having labels or a diagram on the glass case so the customer can easily read. It was not clear what qualified as a Mezze or a Topping (for example the cauliflower is an extra $1 if you build your own bowl but it's in the same area as the chickpeas, picked onions, etc.  Overall, there is a lot of potential for Yafo Kitchen, hopefully they can improve lines and wait times. The food was fresh but I was underwhelmed with the flavor of the pulled chicken. Keep in mind that this place is pretty pricy for a fast casual restaurant, I ordered a salad bowl with pulled chicken and a soft drink - the total was $16. This is a lot pricy compared to the competition and other fast casual restaurants in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I love Yafo Kitchen! When I was an amateur I ordered wraps. THEN I realized if you get a bowl, it comes with that lovely laffa bread on the side and you can make your own wraps out of the contents in the bowl. The bowl also holds a lot more than a wrap will and you can get things that would be funky in wrap form, like beet salad or chickpea salad. Just order the bowl, okay??  The falafel is fantastic and the real unsung hero is the mushrooms! Get them on your bowl, trust me. I don't know how they're seasoned but they add an awesome flavor to the bowl.   My favorite bowl: 1/2 and 1/2 bowl with greens and cous cous  Hummus and baba ganouj  Beet salad  Chickpea salad  Tomato/cucumber salad  Pickles  Kalamata olives  Sumac onions  Cabbage slaw  Falafel  Mushrooms  And a side of schug!   I can easily make two meals out of this.   My only gripe with Yafo is that they were careless with animal products, twice.  One time, they were scooping chicken for another customer and dripped the chicken liquid across my wrap.  A second time, someone had spilled feta into the pickles. When I asked if she could try to avoid the spilled feta and just give me pickles, she replied \"we cannot guarantee our ingredients will be vegan\". I just replied, I get that but as you're scooping can you try to avoid the feta that fell into the pickles?   I'm still giving them 5 stars because the food is so good! But if you are vegan, just watch for the potential cross contamination.",

Coming at the peak of lunch time and being my first time was slightly overwhelming, so I'd recommend checking out the menu online prior to, just so you have an idea. I went for the half and half BYOB, and I'm glad I did because I was able to try a little bit over everything. Their hummus is delicious and smooth, and their taziki has that tangy cool texture you want. I'm not vegan, but I chose the falafel, and I'm glad I did, they were delicious! The bread that you get with the oil/herb sauce on the side helps to scoop up all the goodness in the bowl, getting all the delicate Mediterranean flavors!   Parking can be a little tricky in the center, so just find a spot and take a stroll!",

I got a salad bowl and felt like I was mainly eating lettuce and hummus, plus the romaine wasn't even good!  I asked for cauliflower on top, which is an extra $1, and I always felt the extra dollar was worth it.  This time I got 3 cauliflower florets and they were not big.

    "text": "Yafo is my literal definition of happiness and I am proud to admit I live here once a week.  I love the fresh ingredients they use (organic hummus!) and the quality of the food. It is a bit overwhelming, but after 10+ visits, I think I have it down. Here we go!  1. Choose your base (salad, grain, hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush or half and half). I always get the hummus bowl and ask for a bit of tzatziki and baba ganoush on top. Also, yes to the olive oil and paprika that they drizzle on top of the hummus! 2. Choose your toppings. I get the onions, beets, quinoa salads (there is one that has cranberries and it is MAGICAL - \"lemon and cranberry quinoa salad\"), cauliflower rice tabbouleh, purple cabbage slaw and cucumber/tomato salad. 3. Choose your protein. I usually skip the protein because my bowl is so delicious on its own! Yafo makes me believe I can be a vegetarian.  4. Choose your sides. I get mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and the potatoes on top. Lifehack: if you get the side items on top, they're $1 instead of $3. I do recall a visit where I literally put every single side on top (got a little too overzealous #noregrets).  5. Choose your sauces. My favorites are the cilantro jalapeno sauce, spicy reg schug (habenero.. beware!), garlic sauce and lemon tahini. The cilantro yogurt is also yummy!  Yafo offers a happy pick me up and makes me feel like I'm being healthy, which it is until you eat it with a pound of Mac and cheese. Second lifehack: If you put mac and cheese on a hummus bowl, it becomes healthy. Who knew?",

    "text": "Short summary - farm to table Chiptole version of Mediterranean food. We were in Charlotte and hoped to grab a quick but delicious dinner. Yafo came highly recommended on lists I had seen AND it was a ten minute drive from our hotel. This Yafo is located in this mixed development - part residential apartments and part ground floor commercial and restaurant spaces. We came around 8 PM? Parking was so hard to find! There was already a line inside but people came and left quickly. They have a window where you can see a worker making pita bread. We both got bowls that we built. I got the chicken, white rice, 3 toppings, and an add on of the veggies (Cauliflower?). I should have been more careful with the add-ons because it ended up coming out to about $13/bowl... The only thing I would add to this is that the menu doesn't clarify too well how much each add on costs and the workers didn't really say o, btw, this is an add-on and not part of the build your bowl. Regardless, it was still a lot of food. I only finished like 60% and took the rest to go. R totally fell in love with everything and ever since then, can't help but comment how great it would be if Yafo came to the west coast. I liked the whole concept because it's healthy, quick, and affordable. The pita bread was okay, a bit dry and it was nice that it was included in the meal.",

I started with the falafel wrap. AMAZING. So I came back the next day and got falafel again and brought hubby home a Yafo Shawarma (chicken). Their laffah is amazing. Soft. Warm. Everything from their pickled toppings to their condiments are seasoned so well! Such colorful and tasty ingredients, I've come back probably 8 times in a month. Eggplant, falafel, mixed mushrooms, this is a vegans heaven! After the falafel wrap I tried their bowls and I haven't gone back since. Some days I'll get falafel and keep it minimal but they have many delicious toppings and dressings, it's so hard to not try every combination! So far, my favorite combo has been half salad and half rotating grain bowl, hummus and zaaluk, falafel, cucumber and tomato salad with sumac onions as Mediterranean pickles, spicy red schug, toum, and lemon tahini  writing it out just makes me want a bowl right now!   Parking can be difficult to find at times so try to avoid 12pm if you can! Lots of people dine here for lunch  and the line gets long but they're very quick to get everyone's orders fulfilled. If you eat here often like me, your bank account can dwindle right before your freaking eyes!! But for high quality ingredients and tasty food, worth it! Thanks Yafo!",

I had a couscous bowl with hummus, falafel and basically all the veggies they had, and it was very good and fulfilling. All the ingredients were very fresh, and the hummus was full of flavor.  Did I mention the awesome bread???? You will want more than one. It is freshly baked the bread in house so you get it warm, (you can actually see the process through the window) and it is the perfect side for the bowls, and I am guessing that the wraps are amazing too. It is buttery, but not greasy...  They also offer different healthy teas.  I really enjoyed this place. Will come back for sure!",

Yafo Kitchen is a fast casual type concept, but way elevated. A focus on fresh, quality, and local ingredients. If you're wondering why it costs a little more than other fast casual places, this is why. It's totally worth it. I mean, they even fresh squeeze the lemon juice. Authentic, daily made from scratch bread (you can watch them make the laffa there in house), spreads, and juices (seriously, skip the sodas and pay more for one of these). And, THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE. They also have local beers.   My problem is that I like everything here, so ordering is a struggle for me. I love all the sides. If I build a bowl of some sort, I end up basically adding every topping possible. The portion sizes are generous. I can usually make two meals out of a bowl. Don't be afraid to ask questions. The menu can be a little bit intimidating. Everyone here is nice and will explain it all to you.   It can get pretty crazy here for lunch, so plan accordingly. There will be a line. It does move fairly quickly. I recommend off-peak times or ordering online for take out.",

Up until now I've never had hummus that I truly liked. I never understood why people went crazy for hummus. THIS PLACE MADE ME A BELIEVER!! I ordered the build your own bowl because this was my first time. The workers were very helpful in explaining how the build your own bowl worked. There were many different varieties but I opted for something simple. I got a rice bowl with hummus, chick peas that were seasoned to perfection, purple cabbage and falafel. I didn't add a protein on this trip but next time when I'm not poor I will. They also had a seasonal coconut limeade drink and I was super upset when it was gone. The bowl and drink came to about $15. Good quality food and the workers there are all nice. I had a great experience. I can't rave about this food enough. I will be making this a regular spot.

Because of me being on a diet I decided to order a kids meal for portion control. I got two tiny spoonful of chicken and asked of a third. The server complied but then told the cashier to charge me higher than the price listed. Sometimes the guys have a bit of an attitude and then they expect a tip for doing their job! They're not serving me at a table. Yafo is not on my tops list!",

Today was my first day there and the server had me try practically everything before I built my bowl. It might seem expensive but you get so much food it could easily cover a couple of meals. I built a bowl with so many tasty sides I can't even remember them all. I'm not even much of a chicken person since it's so played out however how they season theirs is definitely worth a try. One of the sides I tried was the macaroni and cheese and I have to give them credit it's delicious",

    "text": "Very happy about the new wave in healthy and fast Mediterranean food that's sweeping the country right now. Like Cava in DC and Naf Naf in Chicagoland, Yafo takes on the Chipotle \"customize it how you like it with fresh ingredients\" model with Mediterranean favorites. Choose from grains, salad, or hummus bowls (you can choose 2 if you want) and the variety of spreads, veggies and grilled meats. I loaded on every single free topping that I could! My only cuisine gripe is that the laffah pita gets hard as soon as it cools. If you are able to avoid the lunchtime rush-DO THAT. Because it's so choose-your-own it can take a while to get through the line. Even still, you'd wait that or more at a traditional sit down place, so no biggie.    The staff goes above and beyond to be helpful. I came in with a dying phone battery and they carried all my food and drinks and keys to the one booth with an accessible outlet. I would have given 4 stars for wait time and lack of seating area to accommodate the crowd (I felt especially bad for monopolizing the only outlet booth as a solo diner), but an extra star is warranted for the friendliness!",

I keep going back because the food is great but every time the staff is more rude than the last. Everyone I have mentioned to says they have the same experience.

The beef kofta is the best protein if you're a meat eater - if you pick this it's grilled-to-order and may come to you a few mins later if they are backed up. The falafel are a must try even if you're a meat eater. I love that it's a side option...and honestly since it's so good I haven't tried the other sides - it's not like falafel anywhere else, they're like a large tater tot size and are super crunchy and burst with flavor! Things I wish were a little different: I love the cauliflower rice tabbouli, just wish it has more herbs/flavor. I wish they would add scallions or red onion to the cucumber and tomato salad or separately...the sumac onions are just not the same as fresh. The cucumber lime mint juice is a must try, but I wish there is an option with those flavors with at least half the amount of sugar added as a healthy alternative. The customer service at Yafo matches the great food they have. They make sure you have everything you need and more. The chef/co-owner walked around to check on everyone and chatted with me about spicy foods and brought me a very spicy sauce. Keep up the great food and service, Yafo!",

You also get a side with each, we got the cauliflower and that was really good too. We could not complain about anything it was all so delicious.

There are a lot of choices, which could be a tad overwhelming, but the bigger issue for me was certain options mix better with other ones. For example, if you want lamb, certain sauces and veggies are best. The staff is very good at helping you managing the process, but personally I wished there were more notes on the menu to help you out before you begin ordering (I hate being the holdup). It's a minor complaint, that does not stop me giving 5 stars, nor will it keep me from going back.",

While I'm a little over the amount of \" fast-casual\" places popping up all over Charlotte, I really, really like this one. Fast-causal with good prices for the quality and quantity. $10-13 bucks for a large meal.  You can build your own 'Greek bowl' and fill it with many delicious flavors and everything seems very fresh. The Greek Mac and Cheese was great too!  Go check this place out, I don't think you will be disappointed.",

Most of the staff are friendly but some folks behind the counter behave as if they are serving the food for free. The only thing they need to do as far as communication is talk but some of them just think they need not interact with you and keep moving away from the customer even before asking if the customer wants anything more. This was not during a rush hour and we usually go there for dinner around 8..",

I also never ever get fountain drinks or anything besides water at restaurants but when I go here, I can't help but to get a fountain drink and do half hibiscus tea and half cucumber drink. Not too sweet and SO refreshing!!! ( Must try!) We got to try their hummus with sauteed mushrooms last time and OH MY! it was SO delicious!   I can't say enough good things about this place!

The menu seems overwhelming at first but it's really not and the staff is very knowledgable and will help you choose toppings etc or explain how the menu works.   All the ingredients were extremely fresh and flavorful. The chicken was so so good as well. I would suggest trying their teas because they are great (the green mint one was my favorite) The portions are huge so you can def make two meals out of it if you need to!   I also noticed the employee wiping down the tables was very attentive and brought us napkins and to go boxes without us having to ask. I also saw him notice there was a family in line w a small child and he set up a high chair at the end of a booth before they even sat down, I thought that was A+ service.   Will be back to try other things on the menu",

The prices are a bit steep for a fast-casual place but you get what you pay for with good quality, fresh food. My favorite is the build-your-own grain bowl with falafel and almost all the toppings! I love that they are willing to let me have a little bit of each of the spreads instead of only choosing one, and I typically like a drizzle of the mint vinaigrette on top. The roasted potatoes topped with Granch aka Greek ranch are such a guilty pleasure! I crave Yafo regularly.  My only complaint is that its often difficult to know which of the toppings are included in the price of the bowl and which are extra (i.e. beets, brussel sprouts) as you're going through the line.",

Service was provided by a bevy of teenagers whose enthusiasm ranged from disinterested to giddy. We'll definitely return (but will  order the chicken next time).",

    "text": "Absolutely delicious. Everything that I tasted was delicious, and since I went with my family I got to taste most of the menu!  Yafo has a lot of variety of options, but my personal favorite is the sabich, which is fried eggplant, hard-boiled egg, pickles, slaw, and delicious sauces wrapped in a house made lafah bread. In terms of salads and sides I loved the quinoa salad made with preserved lemon and cranberries, the roasted Brussels sprouts, the hummus and babaganush. The flavors are incredibly fresh, lots of produce is locally sourced, and the concept is authentic. Reminds me of eating in Tel Aviv.   Other table favorites were the falafel, the Yafo shawarma bowl, the kafta meatballs and the Marrakesh lamb bowl. They even have a kids menu and high chairs.    We loved it, and can't wait to be regulars.  Updated: went back ... Again... I took a break from the sabich (my personal favorite) and ordered the Sharon salad- it was delicious. Over the greens you get a scoop of the quinoa salad with preserved lemons AND a scoop of couscous, beets, goat cheese etc with yummy vinaigrette. The veggies are so fresh, and the flavors are so crisp and vibrant. Throw a few pieces of falafel on top!  Friends ordered the kofta aka kabob aka Middle Eastern meatballs, served in a red sauce that is simmered with warm Mediterranean spices (think cinnamon...). Unlike any other meatball you've had.",

Everything we had was delicious, with lots of leftovers to bring home and chow down for a few more meals. The hummus and baba ganoush are silky smooth and sooo garlicky, and the tzatziki is nice and thick. The lafah tastes really fresh and handmade with pleasantly varying thickness and a great chew. We also split the sabich which was enjoyable, but I might have liked it better if I'd had it hot - still, even at room temperature the flavors of eggplant, egg and pickled veggies were excellent. The shredded brussels sprout salad seemed a little out of the realm of what I'd expect from mediterranean cuisine (not that I know exactly what to expect!) but it was good too, with big chunks of bleu cheese and walnuts.   Prices seem reasonable, especially if you order a few different things and share with someone else. I'm super excited to go visit on my own and try the falafel and pretty much everything else on the menu. I can see this becoming a new favorite lunch spot for sure!",

I don't think there are many resturaunts in Charlotte that fill the void in this food space and I am so glad that Yafo has answered our prayers.   Where do I even begin at how amazing this place is? Well first, there will be a line, but let me assure you, its worth waiting for. While in line, make sure to check out the staff making homemade pita. They create the dough, knead the dough, and fire it in the oven right before your eyes. Choose your base, protein, toppings, sauce, and any sides. There are so many choices, and you know what? I don't think you can make a bad choice. Don't fret about worrying what will go together with what, it will all taste amazing no matter the combination. My favorites are the hummus, lamb, chicken, and sauces. The falafel is delicious and make sure to try the pita! It is the softest, and airiest pita you will ever eat! The portions are huge. Its big enough to share or you can bring home enough for another meal. This is now my new favorite place in Charlotte. Well done Yafo!",

I tried a Chicken Laffah wrap and it was really great, however the way it was wrapped, I had a hard time eating it like a sandwich ( what can I say, I'm a novice to Mediterranean). I ended up forking my way through it. It's what is on the inside that counts anyway. The chicken that comes with the laffah is pulled chicken, savory and tender, seasoned with herbs and spice. I couldn't taste very much salt, so it's likely this is lower sodium fast food, however I couldn't find nutrition information on their website. Nevertheless, my sandwich was AMAZING and did not taste salty, and the Laffah itself (bread) was a little bit TOO good...meaning it was perfect.",

    "text": "Decided to check this place out at the recommendation of a friend. The process is similar to Chipotle and other fast casual restaurants..you go through the \"assembly\" line and pick the items you want and pay at the end. If your item takes additional prep time then it will be brought out to you.   First off, before your start your order you get to watch someone making pita bread.   I had a bowl with half hummus and half romaine and added my toppings from there. The assemblers put everything in its own spot in your bowl and it's your job to mix all the flavors together. Loved the beats and the tabouleh options. There are carnivore options and plenty of vegetarian options to meat everyone's palette. Additionally they have a few creative options at the drink stand. Note: napkins sre below in the counter.  The staff is super friendly and helpful. I was greeted at the door by the cleanup crew who instructed me how this place works.  My only complaint is the amount of hummus is a bit too much. I only had half. I can't imagine eating the full bowl.  Good place from one of Charlotte's well known restauranteurs. We need more of these locally owned places around town.",

I typically order the Shawarma bowl w/tzatziki, hummus, feta, tomatoes and cucumbers and tahini dressing over rice. I tell myself every time I will not finish my bowl and have leftovers and every time I am wrong. I will say the rotisserie chicken and feta are both salty but it all balances out in the end with the remainder of the toppings. If you're on the fence, give it a go! Would make an excellent meal to go, not that I will ever find out. Pro tip: make sure you ask for the schug!",

However, the ingredients are really high quality and diverse. I got a quinoa bowl with falafel, veggies, and the mint dressing. There also appeared to be some unique drink options, but I just had water. There were tons of vegan and gluten free options available, which is great to see. The freshly made bread was amazing when warm but got oddly hard and tough as it sat. We lingered for a hour or more but I am still not sure why the bread became tough and almost stale in such a short period. Overall, it is absolutely worth a repeat visit but I may ask them to hold the bread next time.",

WE stood in line for about 10 minutes. There are lots of tables, the patio was under construction but it didn't look long term so I'd expect it'll be open again soon. The first person who helped us in line was very friendly, the second didn't give a dang about anything. Alas. I couldn't stop piling things onto my plate. I did half hummus/half salad bowl (I personally think getting a hummus bowl would just be too much hummus). I got falafel, beets, slaw, mediterranean salad, and brussels sprouts on top. Everything looked so good I would have gotten it all if I thought I could eat it all.  The food: It's seriously so fresh. EVERYTHING was good. The brussels were particularly delectable. Really blew me away. The lemon dressing was refreshing. The hummus was great. The not-actually-pita that they give you is gooey and warm and amazing. A vegetarian paradise, for sure.  I will be back to Yafo SOON to try those delicious-looking potatoes and everything else that i didn't yet have. So good.",

My sister's family was in town from NY and with my nephew's limited food options (allergies and no meat), Yafo was the perfect place to meet my cousin for lunch. We all enjoyed the big window displaying the laffah bread-making process and individually made our way down the assembly line with our meals. The fresh juices (cucumber mint lime, lemonade, watermelon lime) were in full view of the cashier, so it was easy to order something besides water and on a return trip I'll certainly grab a cookie.  I went for a half and half bowl (lettuce and bulgar) and the guy behind the counter had plenty of personality, which made assembling my bowl more fun than normal. Everyone else eating with me for lunch enjoyed their meal and the service was both fast and friendly. Strong work Yafo.",

The mezzes (sides) are awkwardly in the middle of the line - bowl/wrap/salad, spread, veggies, sides?!, protein, sauce - which doesn't make sense to me, and the meats and sauces are basically out of sight (crammed next to some small beer fridges).

It's a chipotle style line where you select what type of entree you want then add your toppings as you go down the line. I added pretty much anything that looked familiar and mannnnn. It was delicious. Also, get the Brussel sprouts as a side and baklava for dessert. Both crazy good. Can't wait to go back and try more!",

They have a bunch of flavored juices by the tea.  I strongly recommend the cucumber lime mint.  It was so delicious.  And hooray for crunchy ice too!",

Oh my gosh, it's just so fresh and tasty!  My  delivered experience was SO much better than my in person experience.  No chalk boards to read, nothing to try to figure out, no sliding a tray or getting my own drinks, and certainly no fighting that parking lot!  There was simply no comparison- today's postmated Yafo experience was 10 times better and I will repeat it  :-)  ATTENTION YAFO:  PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN THE STEELE CREEK - RIVERGATE AREA!  There is no competition for you in the Steelcreek area (beyond Showmars, which is not the same business model), and we really need a better Mediterranean option  :-)",

There is also an upcharge for additional  toppings in color coded containers. Thats too expensive for that starving for business shopping center.

    "text": "Went on a Tuesday night..close to 7:00.  The line was backed up to the front entrance, so very busy.  However they prepare the food for you as you are in line (similar to Chopt or qdoba) and as you finish in the line you have your food (no wait for them to bring it out to you).  Wanted to try the rotisserie chicken, but they were out of all white meat (what??).  So I ordered 3 mezze (sides).  I ordered the falafel, cauliflower and babaghanoush.  Unfortunately, I got the bottom of the barrel (last remains in pan) of the falafel and cauliflower so they weren't as warm as I would have liked. The cauliflower was very good, falafel on par with other Mediterranean joints, but the babaghanoush was a little too thick for my taste..I've definitely had better in Charlotte. The pita was warm and soft, so bonus points for that. It was so crowded that I had to wipe my own table before sitting down, but when asked for a to-go box, was promptly given one.  I think I would go back, since it's close to work, but won't wait in that long of a line again. Maybe it will be less crowded once it's been open a while.  Reasons for only 4 stars:  \"86\" on white meat chicken, luke-warm veggies,  babaghanoush too thick.",

    "text": "I know this is blasphemous, but after my first visit to Yafo, I wasn't crazy about it. I went right at noon on a weekday and ordered one of their \"pre-set,\" signature bowls because, quite frankly, I was freakin' overwhelmed by the entire experience. From the minute I parked, I was confused... I tried to enter from a side door (right beside where I parked) but couldn't get in. Cue the hunt for the magic door. Once inside, I was greeted with a monstrously long line and super confusing menu. I wanted to ask the employees what they recommended, how all this Mediterranean magic worked, etc. but felt rushed because of the 20+ people waiting in line behind me. So, anyways. I ordered the Yafo Shawarma Bowl. It was OK. Nothing amazing. Nothing awful. I had to wait with tray in hand for a couple minutes until a table opened up. Faced another line to get a drink from the serve yourself fountains. I left not entirely impressed.   I say all that to highlight what a pleasant surprise my 2nd visit today was! Wanting to avoid the crowd, I showed up at 11:30am. Scored a parking spot right out front of the magic door. Things already looking up! When I walked in, there were a couple patrons seated, eating already and only one person in line. Happy day! I wandered up to the counter and stood, staring at the menu for a few minutes. It was so un-crowded, I even had time to stop and watch them making fresh Pita bread to the right of where you start your order. When I was finally ready to order, I was able to ask all sorts of questions as I built my own bowl! What do you prefer -- the cous cous or the rice? Can I have hummus AND babaganoush? Are those pickled onions? (They're sumac onions, btw.) What spices are in the beef? (They gave me a sample to try!) What sauce should I get? Yep. I was THAT girl but I regret nothing! Now that I've been able to take the time to get to know the concept and all the options, I'm in love with Yafo! My bowl was SO good and SO filing. And, let's talk about that pita for a minute! Soft and warm, buttery and salty. So delish! My creation was pretty pricey at $16 with a fountain drink. Service was so friendly, I felt obligated to leave a tip, too which brought my lunch total to $20. Don't get me wrong, the flavor and freshness is worth it, but I won't be able to afford to make Yafo a regular lunch spot at that price point. And, that makes me a little sad.   I'm happy to have discovered the secret to Yafo -- get there early and make your own bowl, taking the time to ask questions your first visit or two -- and looking forward to many future visits when I'm in the mood to splurge a little!",

You order, build your own bowl, wrap or salad, then seat yourself with your creation. Upon entering, watch the worker make and bake the delicious laffah bread.  The food was fantastic. I had a bowl with chicken. Others had wraps or bowl with lamb. Portions were large (for the bowls). The cucumber mint juice was refreshing. Oh, and the macaroni and cheese made with yogurt is rich and delicious.  If the owner is reading this, please consider opening a location in Boca Raton FL.",

I was with my sister and brother in law and sampled some of what they had, and it was all great.  It seems like you can't go wrong with whatever you choose here.

For that, it is 3 stars and not 5.  I feel that if you have a product that is on the pricier range, you should probably have employees that want to sell it to you.    I feel the employees just don't want to be here, and they certainly don't want to be making your lunch.  I have had groans, eye rolls, and flat out refusal to make a late order request.  The menu can be intimidating, and for this reason, the order process doesn't always go as smoothly as possible.  The employees seem to forget this.   I seem to always feel like I am doing something wrong here.    Having said that, the food is simply insanely good, so there is no way in hell I will make this deter me from enjoying it.   It kind of reminds me of the \"Soup Nazi\" episode of Seinfeld, and there will always be soup for me.",

I built my own salad and had the most delicious beets and garbanzos and chicken and finely chopped cucumbers and tomatoes.   I topped it with a lemon vinigarette. Lip smacking good.  I loved the beverage selections too.  I would suggest trying the lime cucumber drink. It was yummy and I refilled three times!   My only recommendation to management would be to turn down the music a notch or two.  While we were eating, the music became more of a distraction than an enhancer of ambiance.   The vet called me to give me some lab results for the pooches, and I had to struggle to hear what she said.  And no, I don't think it's because of hearing loss.

    "text": "I struggle to give it a three today. I have been here many times and it is always excellent, today seems like the manager either was not there or not paying attention, the line staff could not get the order right twice, and the cashier was distant,rude and seemed like she not only disliked her job ,but the customers as well.  The three stars is strictly for the food which is always excellent, the negative review primarily hinges on the cashier. Line staff getting the order wrong was not that big of a deal it happens. But the cashier is the last and main point of contact with the customer, she made no eye contact, did not smile, and when I asked for extra hummus and Laffa bread (which I had requested at the start of the line when I initially placed my order) I asked the cashier twice and the second time (since she failed to even look at me the first time and acknowledge she heard me)I asked someone down line and then the cashier, again without even looking at me, said in a very rude and aggravated tone \"I heard you\". When I finally paid the bill she flipped the screen over and said \"sign this\" which I did, she then turned away and never even said thank you. Unfortunately this is the impression I left with, A place with degrading service, unhappy employees, and not caring at all  I will try it again, because the food is really good and typically the service is excellent. Perhaps this is just a bad day. Really wish the manager had been anywhere near the cash register ,as I would've addressed this to Management directly, but if the manager was anywhere nearby, they certainly did not make their presence known or pay attention to the cashiers attitude and behavior.  I responded to the email from your first customer service representative this morning since no phone number was furnished, I received no response at all as of 6:12 PM today, once again serious customer service issue here when the home-office doesn't even respond to their own request...  5/6/18 After hearing from their main office and providing them a copy of the check and a full description of the people (which they requested), I have never heard back from them, no offer of a complimentary drink or anything of that sort.  Very disappointed, if that is the attitude of the home-office, it is understandable that the service is degrading at this location. If there is that sort of lack of caring about keeping a customer, you can only imagine how the employees must feel. So to sum it up, the food is good, the service is degrading, and the home-office has a laissez-faire attitude towards it all",

    "text": "It saddens me to leave this review today, but after my family's recent (and fourth) visit to Yafo's resulted in a food-borne illness that included chills and severe diarrhea for four of my family members, I felt it was time I shared my experiences eating here. In fact, my husband and two children and I are still trying to recover from whatever we contracted from Yafo's food as I type this; our symptoms of food-borne illness began within 12-48 hours after eating Yafo's, and continued for 4+ days.   If you like Mediterranean food, which we do, you will LOVE the food here. We enjoyed our first meal at Yafo's around 8 months ago and on that occasion, we had a great experience, overall. However, both our second and third meals were ruined by hair in the food, and when I reported this to management, I was not initially believed, which added even more insult to injury considering I had spent nearly $180 on those two meals for my family of six. Additionally, we were offered a very pitiful refund after 3 weeks of back-and-forth discussion for the contaminated (hair) food we purchased on our second and third visits.   Despite being put off with the hair incidents, my family and I decided to give Yafo's another chance at redemption this past week. We went to the restaurant on a weekday evening and spent around $90 in food to go. Unfortunately, this last visit resulted in four family members contracting some sort of food-borne illness that has spanned the past 4-5 days straight. I'm talking cramps, severe diarrhea, intermittent fever, vomiting for one person, and chills. And yes, this is the only food my four family members and I have eaten (together) since the onset of symptoms; the two family members who did not eat the food have been 100% symptom free. I'm submitting a stool sample to my doctor if the illness does not resolve by tomorrow and if so, I will post an update. Bottom line - this illness has been so horrible, my husband and I both had to take off from work, one of our kids also had to stay home from school, and we had to reschedule two appointments.   A couple concerns I noticed while visiting the restaurant this last time: one of the line associates (guy who serves food at the bar as people walk down the line) picked up a couple things off the floor but never changed his gloves; he also served food (touched the serving spoons and bowls, etc.), as food moved down the order line. I also saw a couple guys walk into the food prep area and come back out to serve food without changing gloves. Another staff member left the food aisle to do something in another area of the restaurant (used a soiled white towel to wipe up something and brought the used towel back into the serving line area), and also maintained the same pair of gloves. The young lady who handles the bread always seems to have a clean space so no complaints there.   Staff was friendly on this occasion, but it certainly seems there could very well be some cross-contamination going on given employees were doing multiple things without changing gloves. I truly hope whatever contamination occurred is both discovered and addressed so no one else becomes ill, especially since the food is unique and delicious.   For the above reasons, I'm giving Yafo's a single star. Sadly, our family will not return to this restaurant in the future given how sick the food made us this past week. Foodies beware.",

Next time I want to see if they will mix the hummus, rice and greens all up.   Hummus was delish but I think for me an all hummus bowl would have been too much.   I told the folks behind the counter it was my first time and even though they were packed they were super patient with me. Giving samples of the meat (that lamb!) and explaining all the toppings and salad dressings.   Fingers crossed for a second location in a different part of town soon.",

Always add on beets and don't skip on the Brussel sprouts either. Yafo sweetens the Brussels with dates and they are Devine. If you have time grab a glass of wine with dinner. The service is ALWAYS cheerful and helpful and the line moves quick. It will become a staple in your life once you've had it!",

    "text": "I work nearby the Yafo Kitchen in South Park and usually have it for lunch 1-2 times a month. I'm excited to hear they're opening one in Plaza Midwood as well since that's close to where I live. It's a great fast-casual concept with fresh ingredients and quick service. Even at peak lunch time I'm out the door in 20 minutes if I take my food to go.   I always get the Yafo Schwarma bowl with chicken. I like to add in hummus and chickpea salad. I sometimes also add avocado. It's really delicious and reasonably healthy with lots of fresh vegetables and grains. The flavor combinations are delicious. I like to get a bit of everything in each bite. It doesn't look like that much food but I am rarely ever able to finish the whole thing in one sitting. They give you a side of their fresh flatbread with every order - It's almost like a pita. The bread, grains, and chicken fill me up quick, leaving enough for a second meal later on.   I've had the wraps as well and they are just as delicious, but very messy. All of the sides are amazing, particularly the Brussels sprouts. They are sauteed with dates to add a sweet flavor. The mac and cheese is creamy, crunchy, greatness.   Yafo will be a go-to spot for us for years to come.",

    "text": "I discovered Yafo on a Saturday and have been three times already - today is Monday :) You are getting quality ingredients, delicious flavors and all around fresh food. I've tried their salads, grain bowls with their shwarma chicken, rotisserie chicken and mezze plates - all delicious! Their laffah bread is soft and a great compliment to the meal. For the mezze plates, we've tried tzatiki, hummus, Brussels sprouts, mac n cheese, and falafel. I can't get enough of their Brussels sprouts and tzatiki! My kids ate up the Mac n cheese and bread.  We ordered pb&j too for the kids once, and I'm not sure it worked so well because it came on their laffah/pita bread. I'm not sure the combo worked and it was difficult for the kids to hold and eat. They also serve chicken nuggets and a rice bowl. My kids enjoyed some of our Yafo shwarma rice bowl. I wish they served milk - if you have a kids menu, you should serve milk too! Overall, great quality and service. The food is fresh and delicious, and portions are great. You order your food, watch them make it, pay and seat yourself. The place is clean (bathrooms are updated and clean) and they've got staff turning around tables fairly quickly. It gets pretty crowded so they may need to set up some outdoor seating.  Follow up review: we revisited Yafo at around 4:30pm. The place was empty due to the odd time. We got some of our favorites, and everything was great with the exception of the bread and hummus. The bread was really hard. Previously we've been at peak times so they're constantly making fresh bread. The hummus was overly salty this time around.",

Then came ordering - I'm familiar with the cuisine, but not fluent. I watched in awe as those who went before me confidently pointed and picked and colluded on off-menu items.... I ordered two dinners and one of pretty much every mezze they had. I was taking it home and could sample to my hearts delight. My food lasted me four meals... Probably should have stretched to six. There was not one thing I did not like. The trick to ordering is to promise yourself you will be back. Don't settle on your favorite too quickly. Keep sampling the menu. You'll find your favorites and you'll rotate those, too. The food is of amazing quality. I allow myself to be mesmerized by the Laffah Crew. Their movements are the zen you need right before you order. Don't be rushed... set the pace for yourself. Ask questions. Sample. Don't let that loooooong line behind you worry you one bit. Everyone is happy at Yafo because they are about to eat an amazing meal. Also try the Cucumber Lime Mint elixir.",

Like another reviewer said, they could cut the portion size and charge about $2 less, my lunch was about $12 without a drink, which is kind of expensive for lunch and I could not finish. I know I can take the rest home but just prefer a smaller portion that is less $$ (the most I want to pay for lunch is $10) Only other thing was that the bathroom is on the side of the restaurant that in order to access it, you would need to cut through this huge line of people, and they keep the outer door to that side of the restaurant locked.

You can see the chicken on the rotisserie and the laffah bread being backed in house, which is awesome. I only tried the chicken, but my friend said the lamb was excellent as well. The prices are a bit steep for fast casual, but the portion for my bowl was very large after adding toppings and a protein as well. I'd definitely recommend giving Yafo a shot, especially if you can come at a time that wouldn't be super busy.",

On my visit, the amount of garlic in sauces and vegetables was overwhelming. I eat Mediterranean often, and normally it is not prepared with this much garlic. Otherwise, this place is 5 stars in casual dining.",

I had been to Yafo before and didn't have a good experience, so I was anxious to give it another shot especially with the incredible reviews.  I ordered half hummus, have quinoa, with chicken, cucumber, feta, and chickpeas.  There was some delicious taziki sauce drizzled on top.   I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this bowl was.  I also ordered the cucumber green drink that was really refreshing and delicious.  I wish Yafo published their nutrition because I can't tell how many calories I ate.   I will return.",

I got the 1/4 chicken with falafel and a mixture of cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. The cauliflower was my fav! It was slightly browned on the tips and seasoned with oil and a hint of spices.  The falafel was just ok...they were dripping with oil as they're deep fried.  You also get a naan type of bread which was not bad for dipping. Be sure to try their sauces! I had the taziki, a green one (cilantro, jalepenos & olive oil) and a tahiti one.",

    "text": "My husband ate here with some coworkers a few weeks ago and raved about it. So when we found ourselves in South Park this weekend, we decided to stop in for lunch. After dining here, I must say that I agree with him - the food is great. We both built our own bowl (half rice/half salad) with a ton of toppings. I had the half chicken/half spicy ground beef and my husband had the chicken. It was all so tasty and the delicious, fresh made pita bread was the perfect vessel for all of the Mediterranean goodness!   So why 4 stars instead of 5? First of all, customer service (other than the nice gentleman who started our order) was not great. When my husband asked one particular employee \"how are you?\", she went on and on about how miserable she was to be at work and how she was counting down the minutes until she could leave. Now - we've all had days like this so I get it, but complaining about being at work to a customer who is trying to pay for their meal isn't great customer service. Also, there was an employee walking around asking customers if they needed anything. This man literally walked past our table 3-4 times and never once acknowledged us but offered assistance to every other table around us. It was odd. The other reason I am giving this place one less star is the price. I felt like $30 for two meals with two drinks was about $5 more expensive than it should have been. After typing this, I kinda feel like I would give it three starts but I'm taking into account the quality of the food, the taste of the food, and some of the employees we interacted with who did provide great service. With that being said, I think this place has room to improve.   Note: I sampled the brussel sprouts and even though I didn't get them this time, I definitely will next time because they were delicious!!!",

I'll admit, I was totally overwhelmed the first time I went into YAFO. I felt like such a Mediterranean newb. Thankfully the staff were more than happy to explain the menu and ordering process to me! (PRO TIP: For your first time, try going during a slow period so that you don't feel rushed by the long line!!)  The basic idea is that you can build your own bowl, salad, or wrap. The price for that is $8.99. Most of the toppings are free to add, except proteins and hot toppings, like their Brussels sprouts and potatoes. To get the most bang for your buck, load up on free toppings!!  If you're unsure about your decision-making skills, just go with a Signature Item. All you've gotta pick is whether it's a bowl or a wrap. My personal favorite is the   bowl (without olives), but I think the most popular one is the Yafo Shawarma bowl!  Oh, and if you're wondering what the heck a \"mezze\" is, it's just their fancy word for \"side.\" You can make anything into a side at Yafo. The best mezzes are the Greek Yogurt Mac & Cheese and the Rotisserie Potatoes, though!",

Actually, Yafo changed my feelings on lamb, because the way they make it, you could tell me I wasn't eating something more familiar like beef or pork. Delicious. The variety of options and the well seasoned food keeps me coming back.   I have tried the Brussels sprouts as a side and they're amazing. Honestly, I think this is the only side I've tried, because .. well, if it ain't broke don't fix it, right?  I usually get the Marrakesh Lamb bowl because again, the lamb is amazing. This time I got 1/2 salad and 1/2 hummus as a base. Before I had grains.   Now the part I'm not happy with .. it's a little on the pricey side. $17 for lunch is a bit much IMO. I prefer to keep it around the $10 range. Get more for my $$. But I don't come here often, so I splurge every now and then. Fortunately I'm not feeding a family at that price.",

You order in the front and take it back to your table, much like Chipotle. I got the Half and Half. Originally, I had asked for half grain and half salad but he ended up giving me half salad and half hummus. After being passed to the next lady, I told her the mix-up and she was very snarky about it. She might have been stressed or whatnot, so I just told her it's fine so I can leave her alone and move on. I got the Cauliflower and Tomato Salad as one of my toppings.   I love the pita bread they give you. You can see someone making it in the window and it's so fluffy and chewy, I love it. I mixed my bowl and put it into some pita bread to make mini tacos. Super delish!The Cauliflower and Tomato salad was good, but I could barely make out the cauliflower. I got chicken, which was seasoned very well and not dry. I want more cheese like feta on it because eventually everything in your bowl turns to mush with the amount of sauce and everything tastes the same. Nonetheless, the veggies are very vibrant and fresh! I would love to come back again when I am in the Southpark area.",

Of course the presentation and plating of the food is beautiful here.  This place has a great ambience and super tidy around. Makkaresh Lamb bowl is what I ordered and it was delicious, the lamb was so succulent and loved the taste.  I chose couscous instead of rice and some of the complimentary fixings (they have plenty and for the first time one might need to ask specifically what is what, coz there are no labels for the food).   My lady's salad bowl with chicken was tasting just as good, the shwarma chicken was so delicious and with the fresh veggies and salad fixings, it was a great meal.   you wouldn't feel guilty at all dining here unlike other Mediterranean places coz, their actual meat portion is small and all these fixings make up the major part of the bowl (ultimately making us eat lots of fresh veggies, grains, sprouts, chickpeas etc etc) Loved the place, a bit on the expensive side.  the above mentioned two bowls costs about 25 bucks but its worth it.",

I had heard about this place from a few friends, and decided to try it out. I'm so glad I did!   Yafo has this amazing quality that makes the food filling without being too heavy. I love the idea that you can build your own plate! This makes it a great spot to take everyone--there will be something on the menu every person will like.   Great flavor, unique combinations, good location.   My only gripe is that it's a little pricey for a \"fast food\" restaurant. And their flavored water was a little bland and blah. But honestly, those aren't good reasons to stay away! Highly recommend!",

I really enjoyed their hummus and their bowl concept is very unique for this type of food and Mediterranean culture. Their choices for combos are really good. I love they have options for vegans and meat eaters. Their hummus and pita bread is really good. They have a couple of rice options and even quinoa. Just be careful if you go with the option of \"create your own\" when creating your bowls, unless you like messy wet food you don't want to end up with a base of two large scoops of hummus and tahini sauce mixes at the bottom of your bowl and then have your rice, meat, lettuce soaked in it, unless you like hummus soup. My friend went for that option and then didn't want it as the bowl couldn't hold the drip of wetness and honestly it did look kind of nasty. But that's not a restaurant issue that's your choice, so don't say I didn't give you safe tips!  prices are good and quality too. I recommend.",

Super friendly and helpful employees checked on me multiple times after I sat down to eat. I was genuinely smiling to myself while I dined alone. I'm a little rusty writing yelp reviews but I knew I would be doing a great disservice if I didn't share how fantastic this place is. Well done Yafo!",

Every time I've gone, normally around lunch, the line takes about 10 minutes to get through.  Seating is limited. It's a little pricier than what you would expect to pay at lunch.  You have to park in a lot or parking garage, which can be kind of frustrating if you've never been to this area, which was exactly the case for me the first time I went. Now I'm a pro, so parking has nothing on me.",

Mezze gives you 4 little bowls of cold and/or hot items (not including meat). I ordered beets, potatoes, brussels and falafel for 9.99 which you select as you walk through to pay.

I chose the option of a hummus bowl mixed with a grain bowl. Their portion size was huge. I loved all the veggies. I selected their pickled onion in surmac, the roasted red peppers, and so much more. However, those two toppings really made my food so excellent. And the green dipping sauce they give you... oh my so delicious. The reason I did not give this a five star was due to the cashier checking us out. I hope that the restaurant manager reads this and looks back on the schedule for that day it was from the time frame 12:40pm. So we had a good bit of food left over and I asked the cashier for a to go box. She said \"Give me a second ma'am.\"Yes what she said was polite. However, the way she said it definitely had some attitude. And I understand she was busy ringing other people. So I politely just waited, and I felt horrible for even intruding. I mean if there was a designated area where you could just grab the to go boxes. Or if they placed it around their fountain drink area that would make the most sense. So she rang up two other customers and then she gave me the box and I walked off. Another person in my party went up and asked for to go boxes. She said the same thing. Another employee more towards the back side of the where the cashier was located I guess where they are prepping food provided with her to go box. She also mentioned that she felt like the cashier was rude. My suggestion, please provide a to go box area. Or just have a sign located to point where we could go to grab the to go boxes to avoid receiving attitude from a busy cashier.",

The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but when mixed with all of the ingredients (including tahini dressing and a terrific tzatziki sauce), it worked.  You can hear people all over the restaurant raving about the food.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it's painfully slow; the guys behind the counter are not quick, and because there's so many options and unusual items, people ask a LOT of questions. Your selection gets passed down to another 2 or 3 people as they build it and so you have to keep asking/answering questions or specifying your choice. They'll need to iron that out or folks will walk in and leave immediately if there's any kind of a line.  There were maybe 10 people in front of me and it still took almost 15 minutes before I ordered and another 5 before I was finished.  But it was worth it.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious, absolutely delicious. The reasons for my rating are the following: $30 for two shawarmas, a side each (small portions) and two fountain drinks seems excessive. I was going to go 4/5 because the food really is tasty and fresh but what left a sour taste in my mouth was the amount, or lack there of, of chicken that was put on my chicken shawarma, 3-4 small pieces of pulled chicken breast. I've had shawarmas in Turkey and Romania and those babies should be stuffed, STUFFED, with that tasty rotisserie chicken seasoned to perfection. I also wish there was an option to add fries right inside of it, it takes the entire experience to a whole new level.   My significant other and I had lunch, we were full and satisfied, I just feel like we could have gotten a bit more for our money for $30. That is all.   Everything tasted great and I have to say the organic tea and watermelon juice were the best I've ever had. You know how anything watermelon flavored usually does not taste anything like watermelon? Yeah, not at all the case with their juice. It is like the very essence of the best watermelon you have ever tasted squeezed into a delicious nectar. I had to get a second cup on my way out.",

    "text": "My husband and I finally got a chance to check out Yafo last weekend!  Yafo is located in South Park near Earth Fare. We were able to snag street parking in front...score!  When we first entered, I will admit that I was extremely confused. The menu is not laid out super user friendly. Fortunately, I had done my Yelp research and knew a bit about the menu. I ordered the build your own bowl and the guy making my bowl convinced my husband to get the special of the day (Side Note: I really wish the guy convincing my husband to sway his order would have explained the special a bit better cause it was fried (and we arent really fried food people) and took about 10 minutes longer to cook cause it was made to order....which is normally fine but we were in a rush). For my bowl, I went half hummus and half salad with half chicken half falafel. The falafel portion was pretty small but good. The chicken was delicious. The star of the bowl was definitely the hummus. We piled it on with a ton of extra stuff that I really don't know what it was but it was all tasty. Huge bowl that was enough for both of us. The special came with two sides. We got the brussel sprouts and mac n cheese. The sprouts were fantastic!! Ended up enjoying the fried chicken (it had some pesto layer in between the fried and the chicken that was super good). Just wasn't what we expected. The laffa was perfection.   I am excited to go back to Yafo simply so I know what I am doing when I go there. I think the confusion lies within the odd layout (cue random door that was locked so we had to walk around to get in), little help from the staff as a stare with a confused look in my eye, and food that is a bit unknown/unusual. At the end of the day, we had enough food for two meals and it was all really delicious! My suggestion is to go, pile in whatever you think you may like, and enjoy cause all the food was obviously super fresh and tasty!",

What seemed to the be the manager was very rude to these guys behind us. It was just a really negative, weird experience with a lot of attitude.  Not even an attitude with us but all of the staff seemed to hate  each other. I don't know weird vibe. Totally ruined the experience.  Mostly likely won't go back. I want real Mediterranean food!",

These people know how to run a good restaurant! Morgan couscous isn't supposed to have flavor. Do you expect the white rice you get with Chinese to have flavor? No, It's the specialty crafted sauces, dips, vegetables and meats that pack the flavor and they do an awesome job!  2. JB the reason there is a long line is because the food is truly 1 of a kind! Yelpers ignore JBs review and any other nay sayers. It's worth the wait! The staff moves as fast as they can with the high volume of guests they serve and always go above and beyond!

The setup is like Chipotle where you can either build your own custom order or order from the menu. I did a build your own bowl with rice, chickem, tatziki and a ton of other toppings. It's pricier than a chipotle, mine came out at around $11 but it was A TON of food and the quality was excellent. The pita bread is also freshly made and its incredible. My meal was delicious and Im dying to go back. Their sweet tea is also some of the best I've ever had. Im so glad to have found this place!

Yes, service is great, the line moves reasonably fast, because it is always busy, and the food tastes good, nothing is great. On my most recent visit, I ordered the 1/2 chicken with Brussels Sprouts and Potato Fries. Although the chicken was cooked to perfection, moist and piping hot, the two sides were pretty bland and probably wouldn't order again.  If you like Mediterranean food, fast casual atmosphere, typically a wait, and decent food, Yafo is your place. As for me, I'll probably go elsewhere.",

It's the first fast casual restaurant he's done and he did it well. It's a Chipotle-style Mediterranean restaurant.   I always get a build your own bowl. For your base you can choose hummus, salad, or grain. You can also do half and half. I got hummus the first time, but it was a ton of hummus. I love hummus, but it was too much for me. I recommend either doing a half and half or getting a different base and just getting hummus as a spread. I get almost all of the free toppings. They're all great. The Brussels sprouts are really good if you want to pay extra for them. For the protein, I've had falafel, chicken shwarma, and lamb. The falafel and chicken are my favorite. It's also served with awesome warm laffa. I also highly recommend their cucumber lime mint drink (also good mixed with the lemonade).   The portion for the build your own bowl is huge, so come hungry!   It's pretty popular, so the line can get long at popular lunch hours. It moves pretty fast though.  If you haven't been already, Yafo is a must try!",

    "text": "Came here with a friend for lunch after being down with food poisoning for a day and a half. This was the first meal I'd had since then. It probably wasn't a good start a meal because of all the flavors, but it was definitely delicious  and worth it.   As many others have said, the concept of this place is like Chipotle. You walk up and order your food from a steam table with lots of options. They have some premade options and some build on your own. They also sell rotisserie chicken. Per my friend suggestion, we both got the Marrakesh Lamb Bowl, as is. Of course with the delicious Mediterranean flatbread that comes with it. The line was pretty long when we got there. So in an effort to hold the table, my friend stayed seated while I ordered for both of us.   The Lamb was pretty pricey, coming in at  about $15 bucks a piece with tax. But honestly, the food was spot on and worth it.   The lamb was shredded in a way that I haven't seen before, kind of like pulled pork. Admittedly, I was initially a bit leery. I like my lamb sliced. But it was absolutely divine: tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned.   The other flavors of the ball were amazing and all melded together very well. I only wished that the harissa yogurt was a bit more spicy. The flavors of this bowl were very rich in a bit too much for coming off of a two-day food poisoning induced fast, but I still managed to about a quarter to a half of the healthy portion. The flatbread was absolutely wonderful: Pillowy, soft and chewy.   We didn't try any of their signature drinks though there were many. We were advised of the coconut limeade was absolutely divine.   The customer service was excellent overall. Very fast and efficient and we ended up getting through the line fairly quickly. As we were finishing up and engaging in conversation, a nice lady came by and bussed our table for us.   The one blip I will mention is that when I walked up to request take away bowls for our leftovers, two employees were engrossed in a personal conversation. They looked at me, but never acknowledged me. I waited patiently and after I was finally acknowledged, I was passed the bowls as the conversation continued with no further eye contact or apology. This is significant because one of those individuals appeared to be the line manager.  Overall the experience was great wait to go back and try them again. I think that this will be a great lunchtime place in a day off since it's on the opposite side of town from me.",

    "text": "I hesitated writing this review because I feel if you have nothing nice to say, don't say it. My wife convinced me to write it, because management should know where to make corrections.   My experience here was good until the very end. My wife and I thought the food was good. Unfortunately, when I went to get a refill on my drink, I saw a baby roach walking across the juice counter. I grew up in NYC, so it's something I'm used to seeing. But this is a nice place and that sort of stuff should not be happening. Where there's one bug, usually there is a bunch more. I said nothing to my wife because she has a very weak stomach.  But if I had to choose between Yafo and Cava, Yafo does have better flavors. Unfortunately, I don't see myself going back.",

At first I was overwhelmed on what I should get, but the server was helpful in explaining the options. I decided to build my own bowl. I appreciate that they have the choices laid out in front of you with labels to go with it, because I don't know what some of the words mean and having a visual helps in deciding. I got the half-and-half bowl (half couscous and half salad) with cucumber and tomato salad, chickpea and roasted pepper salad, cauliflower rice tabbouleh, beets, sumac onions, shawarma chicken, and tzatziki sauce and Schug (cilantro jalapeno sauce) on the side. Everything was delicious! Yafo is reasonably priced for a healthy meal and they give good portions. One bowl was almost enough for me to get 2 meals out of it. I've tried CAVA before and it has the same concept, but I honestly like Yafo more. I'll be coming back!",

My mom and I popped in right before the lunch crowd - having never been there I understood the concept, but was unsure of what to order. I felt as though the staff was slightly aggressive (pre-rush) with taking my order. The gentleman handling the meat additions was extremely rude - not acknowledging us for an extended period of time and just genuinely not engaging in a friendly way. Despite it being before the rush they were out of Kofta and  was told it would be 5 mins I declined as I didn't want to hold up the line. I believe this ordering system would be much easier if staff offered friendly suggestions and didn't slow down the process my demanding answers or ignoring customers.   I might try this place again, but improvements need to be made in regards to customer service and providing menu clarity.",

I got carried away with the toppings and would scale it back next time.  This is a really good concept and quality food.  You order in line and they make it in front of you.

    "text": "Why do I crave Yafo Kitchen all the time???  Maybe because it's delicious maybe cause it healthy!!! Plus It's really close to work so I can pop in anytime.   Now when you come in might be overwhelming looking at the menu board, the employees on the line and the cooking process going on in the background but take your time. It's very simple. They will also let you sample anything on the line.   I'm in love with their mezzes. My faves are the creamy Greek Yogurt Mac and Cheese and the Roasted Cauliflower. If I'm not that hungry I grab those two for lunch and will be completely satisfied. Now if I'm trying to get 2 meals out of one order than I get the create your own options. I'm normally a half grain half salad type of girl however today I chose the half hummus half salad option. It was soooo delicious!!! I added shawarma chicken as my protein and tahini on top. I always get the purple cabbage slaw, the pickled sumac onions, pickles, feta, the chick pea red pepper salad and the quinoa salad. I tried the black kalamata olives once and they were too salty for me. I also really like the green Schug sauce they have on the side. You have to request it. It's amazing and really add a lot of flavor to your bowl.   I rarely eat inside but always take it to go. The meal really holds up well and I'm able to eat part for like lunch and save half for dinner. All of the employees have been helpful and really know the menu.

There are various meat and vegan toppers like falafel- lamb- grilled mushrooms - chicken ......  But let's talk their Shug sauce insanely simple (oil cilantro salt n pepper n garlic) but ohhhhh so good  I mean slather that stuff on everything y'all   They have an assortment of sweet or non sweet black and flavored teas and your basic fountain drinks   We don't live on this side of town and good thing as I'd find it hard not to keep this in heavy rotation",

We ordered the shawarma chicken bowl and it was awesome to eat on a lovely spring afternoon . We also got the cucumber mint  juice whuch my husband loved ! He even asked me to get mint to try making at home and he is not a fan of mint ! So I could tell he loved that juice! Portion sizes are huge and we packed the leftovers . Prices are reasonable ! I would definitely visit again especially since it's in the South Park area which we visit most often .",

I ordered a rice bowl. I must say -  it's a little confusing that Yafo even has a menu posted on the wall. It's kind of like Subway (gross) or Chipotle in that you watch your food being assembled as you go down the line, so you order as you go. I'm not sure why a menu exists except maybe to make suggestions.   My rice bowl was assembled as I progressed down the line, which moved quickly thanks to their quick and friendly staff (Hi Ben! You're the best!), and every addition to my bowl made it more and more delicious. From the rice to the falafel, to the garlic sauce - it all mixed together to create an insanely delicious and healthy (sure, why not?) meal.   It'd be awesome if Yafo could make a gluten-free version of their ridiculously yummy-looking pita bread, but the boyfriend was more than happy to eat my gluten-ous version that came with my bowl.   We will definitely be back very soon, and I'll be counting down the days until the new location opens down the street from me in Dilworth!",

The eggplant and the beef with pine nuts, with hummus, a variety of toppings including the cucumber/tomato salad, olives, onions, cabbage with toasted almonds and cilantro yogurt sauce. It comes with bread that is soft and warm and so delicious! The whole bowl was such a wonderful collection of flavors and textures, from the beef, wheat, hummus, cabbage etc. Seriously it's a little bowl of food heaven!!  The eggplant is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and absolutely delicious!!! The beef was wonderfully flavored! The best thing is that you can come here and make a whole lot of different combinations and thus have something new each time!  Pet peeve- they have recyclable cups but don't recycle!!! WHY?!!! I took mine home to recycle! Please do that too if you care about the environment and want you kids and grandkids see the beautiful earth that we do!",

Unlike other places that limit the amount of items to be added to a certain number, I just didn't feel that way here. The staff was so kind and gave suggestions too. The rice were so well cooked and chicken well seasoned. The hummus tasted great and everything on my bowl was finger licking good. The interesting thing is my 4 year old enjoyed this food as much as I did (kids can be picky but this food is just amazing). I want to come back often but the south park location is a stretch for me. I wish to go again soon and highly recommend other to go check out this delicious food.",

I ordered their signature marrakesh lamb bowl. As this is my first time, I was a little confused. Their signature menu looks what will be included for the bowl. But the staff asked me what kind of ingredients I want to add. I chose a couple and it turns out 'my own dish', not a marrakesh lamb bowl.   I don't know if their system is like this(Even though I chose the fixed menu and I can still add some of ingredients?)or there is a miscommunication with staff. Anyway, the lamb was tender and all the ingredients were fresh. I just didn't like the combination I chose. Better try their signature bowl next time. Their lime mint drink was very refreshing and goes well with any dishes. Good place for healthy eating!",

They do get super busy and this \"fast casual\" place can turn just casual (because the line is out the door and it's no longer fast), so avoid peak times if possible. If I'm coming here for lunch, I try to arrive before 11:30 and if I'm coming for dinner I try to arrive before 6.   My favorite is the build your own bowl. I order it to-go even when I plan on dining in as the portion is large enough that I ALWAYS have leftovers. I do the half Romain, half rice bowl and I pack that thing full with cucumbers, tomatoes, hummus, pickled onions, falafel, tahini, and more. Each bowl also comes with a huge piece of pita bread.   They have great family style options, which makes this place a great deal for groups. They also have indoor and outdoor seating. I love their food and the service is always great as well!",

Some of the items they will let you taste if you just ask.   Hit: -Hummus -Wheat grain -Cauliflower -Mixture of tomatoes and cucumber -Cucumber -Cilantro  If you order for a group you can get fried pita chips. I got these during a home tour in plaza midwood. It's so amazing that it's pretty much the only reason I came to this place. The hummus, tomato, & cucumber mix on the chips were to die for!!  I was completely bummed out the pita chips aren't ever on the regular menu.

Who doesn't want fast, gourmet Mediterranean food that leaves you feeling satisfied?   The second time wasnt the same. My main girl and I decided to grab food after Crossfit about 10 minutes before they closed. We got there and placed our order along with a couple other employees that were being let go early. It was when our wraps were being sloppily put together with scarce leftovers where we felt our love for Yafo fade. They didn't ask us if we wanted certain ingredients our wraps. They automatically put our food in to go cups (ultimately making our food soggy). We ended up sitting on the bench outside because we were pushed out of the restaurant after snide comments made from all the employees. I don't care if I walk into the restaurant 5 minutes before you close, keep your attitude to yourself. I work in food service and never in my life would I run a customer out of the restaurant just because I've had a long day and want to go home.",

    "text": "This is a great addition to the casual dining scene in Charlotte.   I would thoroughly recommend!  The food is delicious and very healthy.  I've only been here twice but I want to come back and try everything!  So much to pick from.  I've had the Shawarma Chicken wrap and the felafel wrap...both were great.  Both are wrapped in fresh Laffah bread (sort of like naan) which they make right in front of you when in line.  The wraps comes with a mezze side.  Both times I got the Brussels sprouts with dates as I side because it was amazing!  My friend had the build-your-own bowl which he loved.  Food is great quality but a bit pricey for casual.  It's sort of set up like a Chipotle when you get in line and select your food.  The decor and ambience is much nicer and they do serve wine and beer.  I love the decor...modern wood, pendant lights, bright green accent chairs.  The plates are very cool...white distressed metal.    It's always crowded, so on the down-side the line can be long and sometimes it is hard to find a table.   Hope they open more locations.   This is a winner!",

It took about 30 minutes to get through the line at 7:30 but it was only their first week in business so they'll probably iron those kinds of kinks.   We tried the hummus bowl, grain bowl, and kids Mac and cheese and shared everything! The Shawarma Grain Bowl was the best, filled with all kinds of fresh and savory flavors combined perfectly. My 9 year old gobbled down the hummus and freshly baked Laffah.   Good place for pre movie meal or workday lunch. Can't wait to go again",

It still wasn't a bad taste. The chicken shwarma was also a little bit different but I still enjoyed it. The mint lemonade was awesome. I will be returning to try something else.",

They have great rice (My favorite food there) and awesome potatoes, too! I love the chicken, and always enjoy my free cookie ( I would recommend snickerdoodle). They have pretty good seating. Yafo is kid friendly and everyone in my family loves it. I also like the macaroni, but prefer the chicken and rice bowl. I would recommend Yafo to anyone looking for a good place to eat. The lines aren't to long, and I think it's good how you immediately get your food (Unlike other restaurants where you have to wait). So, everyone, get in the car and head to Yafo Kitchen!",

I love the open menu where you can either build from the bottom or choose an item already designed for you. Both times I have built my own salad topped with chicken, tabouli, chickpea salad, purple cabbage, hummus, cucumber/tomato salad and tzaziki. I have yet to try the sides from the hot bar but the grilled cauliflower always looks amazing, along with the brussel sprouts and mac n' cheese. I will definitely be coming back to mix up my menu next time! Also the Watermelon Lime juice is AMAZING! Definitely worth the extra cost",

I have tasted other items on the menu (via the plates of friends and family) and they are delicious as well. The major plus is that it is guilt-free eating, the Mediterranean diet is healthy AND delicious! Another plus is that the staff is made up of a great group of folks! When my family and I come in, we are always greeted with smiles and have become friendly with a few of the regulars we see.  Bottom line- Yafo, always puts a smile on my family's faces!  #faithfulcustomer",

The set up is very similar to Chipotle so I was able to see all of the ingredients and pick what I wanted in my entree. I had their falafels which were some of the best I have ever had. They were seasoned perfectly and fried to perfection. I also ordered the sabich which included eggplant, hummus, cucumber and tomato salad, hard boiled egg, pickles, purple slaw, amba, tahini, schug with tzatziki sauce and garlic naan bread on the side.   I loved that the eggplant was lightly fried, i wish that the dish came with more. Overall I thought all the sauces went perfectly with the dish. I think my next go round I will order extra eggplant.

We came here around 1145am hoping to beat the lunch crowd and the line was almost out the door. The good news is that the nice goes by pretty quickly.   It's hard to pick what you want to eat but I decided to try the BYOB with rice, chicken, onions, cucumber, chick peas. I wanted a few sauces on the side. I tried their really hot sauce (I forgot the name), granch (amazing) and their jalapeno one. They were all good. I got my husband a chicken wrap to go with a side of brussel sprouts. He loved it as well as the sauces I got him.   We were lucky to find a table after we paid. They do have a drink station as well as utensils and napkins in that area. The layout of the restaurant itself is weird, you have to pass by people in line to get to it OR go outside and around the the other door.  Overall, good experience.

    "text": "If Chipotle and Fresh Kitchen and Greece got together and made a delicious food baby, this would be their love child.   It has the structure of a Chipotle while having the delicious freshness of a Fresh Kitchen and the delicious Grecian/Mediterranean flare.   It has far more options than a Chipotle which makes it tough. EVERYTHING looks so good and everything I tried (hummus, spinach, tabbouleh, pickled onions, Brussels sprouts, roasted cauliflower, and a Cilantro dressing) was delicious.   Ohhhh! And it comes with freshly made pita that you can actually watch them make.   Plenty of fresh iced tea drink options and even a couple beer options.   Decently priced, huge portions. Easy to get you and the whole family plenty full.   And it seems nice and quick for the quality! The line did move slower than Chipotle, but with so many options, I get it!",

I've never been a huge fan of hummus but this place changed my mind. I will say the desserts could have been a little better, but everything else was great.",

We arrived around 11 am, took our seats scoped out the menu and then ordered. There were maybe three people in line.   The food is already prepared and ready to be out on. Your plate as you go through the line.  So there is no wait from order to table which is awesome.    I ordered the half chicken and my wife ordered the lamb dish.  Both were very good and had leftovers to take home.  Total bill was around $36.00 and included one drink and a side of mushrooms.   Everything was great and I have no complaints.  However it was not what I expected and a little disappointed because of all the 5 star reviews.    Overall great place but not to die for.",

Yes and I would try a bowl with the fresh ingredients...all kinds of veggies, hummus, etc.  And the service was outstanding.

The serving size is generous and the staff was super helpful and friendly. My wife and I eat at Zoe's a lot due to healthy options and she said she liked this better than Zoe's. Gasp!

I usually get the build-your-own-bowl with half rice and half salad. Then you ad a spread option (like hummus) and what seems like unlimited toppings before you choose a protein option.  They also have amazing sides - which you can add on TOP of your bowl for a cheaper price.   Protein: The falafel (protein option) are smaller but this allows them to be extra crispy.   Sides: The sides are delicious - so far I'm loving the crispy cauliflower and the crispy potatoes! I've heard the Mac n cheese is amazing too.   Sauces: There are tons of delicious sauces to put on top- I like to try - few on the side so my bowl doesn't get soggy. Harrisa yogurt & cilantro yogurt are my favorite!  Drinks: their house made drinks are SO SO delicious. I love the basil lemonade and coconut lemonade!",

She's on a keto diet (very low carbs) and so I expected a certain amount of challenge with finding a way to fit that into her program. As it turned out, that worry was unfounded!  Mrs. ordered the quarter rotisserie chicken and for her sides, the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Maybe there were hidden carbs in the sauces, but overall this fits well on her eating regime. As well, she declared it super delicious and \"five stars worthy.\"  I chose the lamb bowl, with a base of white rice. Nicely loaded with tzatziki, tomato cucumber salad and garbanzo beans, it was delicious and super filling. The lamb was very tender and very tasty. I enjoyed it thoroughly.  We really like Yafo and I can see being back here soon!",

This place is a a Mediterranean restaurant concept with lots of great flavors and food choices.  You can either get a pre-set item or make your own salad or rice bowl.  You have a bunch of free toppings that come with the bowl, such as hummus, cucumbers, couscous, etc.  You also have a choice of protein for $2.00 extra (I tried the shredded lamb and it was pretty good).  Even though your bowl will totally fill you up, save room for some of their sides.  If you add them on top of your bowl, it's an extra $0.99.  If you get it on the side to have a larger portion, it's an extra $1.99.  I tried the Brussels, cauliflower, and Mac & Cheese and they were ALL great.  Also a plus are the fountain drinks they have on the side as soda alternatives.  The lemonade was awesome, and they also had cucumber mint and watermelon.  By the time I finished piling everything on my tray, my bill was $23!  Yes, a bit pricey, but I will tell you that everything was totally fresh and I was full for most of the next day (yeah, I admit, I ate too much).  I will certainly be a regular here.  It's great if you just want to sit down for a casual, good quality lunch on a weekend or dinner with family/friends.  I went on Sunday night and it was totally packed.  Expect to wait in line, but no worries on the seating because they have plenty of tables.",

The food is alright, nothing great as I am a huge Middle-Eastern cuisine lover. I feel this place could do better in management and food management. Also, is there a reason to always place bread in foil wrapping? The reason I am asking if the bread is freshly prepared and warm, wrapping in foil causes the moisture to be trapped inside making the bread soggy. I visit this place really for convenience as it is close to where I reside, don't really know what the hype is about this place......",

It's a new concept restaurant opened by the same restaurant group that runs Midwood Smokehouse and Paco's Tacos & Tequila.   Walking in for the first time can be a bit overwhelming. The menu is pretty huge for a place that feels like it should be quick. The basic idea is - pick a bowl, a wrap, or a salad to start, then top it whatever strikes your fancy. The toppings in the black containers are free and the ones in the white containers will cost you a bit extra. I really love the hummus bowl with chicken ($10.99). The portions are HUGE. The hummus bowl starts with almost 2 FULL scoops of hummus. The bowl was served with fresh made laffa bread (think pita without the pocket) and a great cilantro jalapeno sauce. It is easily enough food for two people and then some. Both times I went, I split the hummus bowl with someone else and took enough home for a third meal.   I really enjoyed their pickles, brussels, and falafel.  Honestly, my suggestion would be to make the portion sizes a little smaller and charge $2 less for the mains.",

    "text": "After hearing all the buzz about Yafo Kitchen, we decided to stop here for dinner one evening while shopping in SouthPark.  Yafo is a fast casual place, where they prepare the food in front of you.  The menu is pretty extensive--with lots of options--so I'd suggest previewing it online so you're better prepared for your order.    I got the falafel wrap.  It's served on their homemade (and delicious!) laffah bread with one large side.  I got the couscous, which had an interesting spice that I liked very much.  At $10.99, it's a little more than I usually pay for a falafel wrap, but it was so delicious that I have no doubt I'll order this again.  My husband got the six mezze plate, since he wanted to try a variety.  He got the hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, beets with goat cheese, cumin rice, tzaziki, and of course, laffah.  The portions are pretty large, and we could have split fewer mezze dishes.  His favorites were the hummus, rice, tabbouleh, and tzaziki.  And I loved the tzaziki on my falafel wrap!  I hope they open another location soon in Lake Norman!  Until then, we'll keep coming to this location.",

One of the food preparers was very short with us as she made my bowl and then the woman who rang us up followed suit. I simply asked her if there were any sauces to accompany the bowl. Obviously very annoyed, she didn't even attempt to answer my question, quickly made 3 little containers of the different sauces available and told me my food total without even ever making eye contact.   When it comes down to it, the food was delicious and very fresh. I just wish our experience had been better. For that reason, it does not make us want to return again which is such a shame. This would be a great go to lunch or quick dinner spot otherwise.",

Can't imagine how good it'd be even more fresh earlier in the day. Another thing I noticed was how much food they'd give you. Normally, in places like this, where you order down the line, they serve you tiny little scoops of each thing. But here they just pour it on (not excessive) but a good amount, even if your protein choice. Kind of appreciated this.",

    "text": "After seeing a review about Yafo on Charlotte Agenda and then realizing that it is close to home, it quickly jumped to the top of our list of places to eat. We went in today for a late lunch,  it was an odd time of day so it was fairly quiet inside. We were greeted by several friendly faces. Decor is nice with a modern edge to it, very clean inside (including the food prep line), and the patio appears that it will be a wonderful addition once complete.  The gentlemen that took our orders and assembled our meals were very polite, a little shy still, but informative about any questions regarding menu items. I ordered the Sabich which comes with (among many other delicious things) a tomato mixture, they had currently run out of the mixture and were very apologetic, so they offered to add more of another ingredient which was just fine with me! The Sabich was delicious!! The flavor combinations were brilliant. It is large and packed full of wonderful and obviously fresh ingredients. It comes with a side, today I chose the rice mixture that had a mildly spicy oil-based cilantro sauce. My boyfriend opted to build his own wrap, which also comes with a side. There are plenty of ingredients to choose from leading his wrap to be of generous portion as well, which he thoroughly enjoyed.   After we had chowed down on every bite of our meal we had a lovely surprise, Chef Shai Fargian stopped by our table. He offered complimentary Nutella Truffles and personally greeted us. He asked how they did today and what they could do better and chatted for a couple of minutes. 1) It speaks volumes of how much pride he has in his food to personally approach customers 2) He is a super friendly man whom is very skilled in his trade and 3) We advised him that we honestly could not think of anything to do better, the whole experience was lovely and the food was amazing. Somehow we mentioned how many rave reviews we have heard about Yafo's hummus and how much my boyfriend enjoyed it on his wrap. We were pleased to hear how they hand make the hummus in-house from organic chickpeas and how he said it was one of the restaurants \"labors of love\".  Super great gentleman who made this afternoon dining experience even better. And just so you know the truffles were killer, so good!  So come in and grab a meal at a place you can enjoy many options, including Vegan and Vegetarian, and not have to sacrifice flavor or the amount of ingredients. You can even have a fresh made juice/lemonade or beer- they have some on tap and some canned options. We will definitely be back, there's nothing like being able to grab a meal that you trust to be fresh and made from ingredients you would actually buy for your own home. A+! :)",

It is setup like most other fast casual places, you choose a wrap or a bowl and go from there.  I chose a wrap.  It comes in this wonderfully soft fluffy nan type bread.  You then get humus, tabouleh or babaganoush.  After that add your veggies, choose of meat, I got chicken and then choose a side.  A little pricey but very tasty and such a nice clean setting with very helpful people behind the counter.  I had no idea what I was doing and they guided me right through.  All in all, a really good dinner, even if you don't love this type of food, give them a try!",

There aren't any signs for any of their items so I decided to get one of their predefined bowls to make it easy on myself.   I tell the 1st worker that I want the Kafo Schwarma bowl and the order starts. Then I have to tell the next person the same thing. Once I get to the 3rd person, I get asked about my addons. I ask them what each one is and tell them I would like some falafel. I don't realize til after I pay that there was no chicken and I was charged a build your own with falafel.   While I have no problem with that and I wasn't incorrectly charged, I feel that the process could be just a bit better since I might as well just make my own bowl every time if it's going to get lost in translation. Besides that, the food was good and fresh so I'll still give them another shot.",

I love the \"create your own bowl\" option and the staff was super helpful at explaining the ingredients. I wasn't sure if I wanted quinoa or cumin rice as the base of my bowl and when I asked which one is better, my servers response was \"why don't I give you a scoop of both and you tell me which one is better next time you come?\" which I thought was really nice (for reference i liked the rice better)! I also got the cucumber and tomato salad and chickpeas on top with falafel, hummus and tzatziki sauce.  My boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken plate and absolutely loved it. The mac and cheese and potatoes that he got as his sides were tasty and good complements to the chicken.   It is a bit of a hike from the uptown area but definitely worth the drive! If you are a fan of places like viva chicken and chipotle I recommend that you try Yafo as soon as possible.   It is also a good spot for a cheap date night: get your food to go, pick up a bottle of wine from winestore. next door and bring them home enjoy while watching a movie!",

I did my build your own hummus bowl and it was probably enough for two meals. everything looked and tasted delicious. it's certainly not a Michelin-starred meal, but it's great for under $15 lunches. 5/7 would come back again",

The staff behind the counter are always friendly and even when the restaurant is busy the constant flow of people going in and out allows you to always find a table.  The hummus is amazing, as well as their laffah bread, which is made right behind the counter.  Their unique drinks include Cucumber Mint Lime tea and Watermelon Mint tea I believe, each of which are great.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Charlotte!",

But they have signs up describing each item to decide what to add.  The mezzes (appetizers/sides) are so scrumptious. baked cauliflower, falafels, mac & cheese, etc.   I think the staff realizes that a lot of folks don't know what or how to order so they're friendly and can help you decide.  We usually get the build a bowl. They start with a base like rice or quinoa, then add the sides to the bowl. The protein is an extra $2.  Oh, and you have GOT to order a juice. It's real juice, not processed. You can get cucumber with lime and mint, or watermelon with lime. These drinks are very, very good. It's all you can drink, so fill up before you leave!! We will definitely be back. We've eaten here twice now and each time has been wonderful.  It can get a bit pricey but what you're getting in exchange, your body will thank you for.",

The outdoor space was beautiful with benches and pillows but that day was too cold to sit outside.   The Mediterranean restaurant had a real easy menu. You choose between a wrap, bowl or a hummus and you get to choose the greenies, sauces and protein just like any other deli.   The hummus tasted great and the vegetables were super fresh. The best part was the freshly cooked vegetables - the falafel balls were crispy hot, the cauliflower was fried to beautiful brown color, the potato wedges were cooked with skin on, and the Brussels sprouts were awesome.   I had a grain bowl with half quinoa and half rice, chicken shawarma and a lot of veggies. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and took our resolution to come back here often.",

This place gets busy, which is to be expected, so around peak times build in time to wait. It's worth it though, I promise. I typically stick to the falafel and the bowls. If you want grain and hummus, get a mixed bowl with both. It's still an incredibly generous portion of both bases, and I get tzatziki on top, which is great. They have so many awesome toppings and don't skimp on any of them. The falafel are smaller sized but crispy and tasty. And the bowls come with a laffah, which are perfectly baked breads you can watch them make fresh as you wait in line. I also recently tried the greek yogurt mac and cheese and it's pretty life changing. Not to mention a good sized side of it is only $2.99. Yafo also has so many fresh sauces, the cilantro yogurt is a favorite. My husband gets the chicken when we visit and while it's delicious, it's definitely messy, so know that going in. He looks longingly at my perfectly cold and fresh bowl with the falafel on top because by the time we get it home, his is melted into kind of a soupy bowl. I'm not sure if they could drain the chicken a little better or if there's some way to combat this but regardless, he loves it and keeps ordering it. I haven't tried the half chickens but they look great whenever I see them get ordered, so I'll have to come back soon to try one of those.",

They pride themselves on healthy food with an authentic taste. During lunch it gets very busy so I suggest getting there early or get it to go if you are on a time schedule. While you wait you are able to see them make there freshly made Baked Laffah which is basically a type of pita. When you get to where you order, you can get a signature dish or make your own. For the first experience I suggest trying one of their signature bowls so you figure out what you like. They also serve sides that you can get on top or on the side. The brussel sprouts were SO delicious. They give you a lot of food for the amount you pay. So don't be discouraged if its expensive. You will definitely have to take some to go.",

    "text": "I'm picky about Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants. I'm Persian and I've had people rave to me about Mediterranean and Middle Eastern places multiple times and I'd ALWAYS be disappointed when I tried them. They were always a waste of money and I'd leave thinking eating at my parents' house is way better than that place.   Well, I came to the conclusion a long time ago that no restaurant is better than Mom and Dad's house, but Yafo Kitchen comes in second place! I'm so glad I listened to all the rave reviews and tried it today.  I went at 3:30 to get takeout and there were more people sitting there eating than you'd normally find at a restaurant at that time. There was no one waiting in line and the man behind the counter was helpful and excited when I said it was my first time eating there. He made me two samples of tahini and lemon herb vinaigrette. I wish I had tried the hummus also, but I completely forgot about it. I liked the tahini, but the lemon herb vinaigrette was just ok and I didn't order it.  I ended up building my own bowl with a base of Cumin Jasmine Rice, Tzatziki spread, Tomato, Cucumber. Tabbouleh, Purple Cabbage Slaw, Feta Cheese, Chickpea & Roasted Pepper Salad, Cucumber & Tomato Salad, Shawarma Chicken and Tahini just on the Shawarma Chicken.   The bowl was so yummy! I asked for more feta cheese twice and I appreciated not getting any sass or side eye from the employee about my triple feta, which was so worth it. My bowl was so ridiculously big that I couldn't figure out what was in the bowl that I didn't like since there was so much food. I think it was the tabbouleh or the purple cabbage slaw.   I'm all about getting multiple meals out of takeout and I definitely did with this bowl. You also get a side of pita bread (something else I'm picky about since I'm Middle Eastern) and it was delicious. The base of cumin jasmine rice was good too and it definitely didn't taste like boxed rice - I'm sure they use a rice cooker!   The rave Yelp reviews and a recommendation from a friend who said I had to get it made me order the greek yogurt mac & cheese, which was some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had! I highly recommend everyone try it. I'll never go back to Yafo Kitchen again without ordering it.  I can't wait to come here again and try out more items on the menu, especially the falafel and hummus. This place is a little pricier than Chipotle as a takeout option, but is well worth it! I'm excited they are opening another location this summer.",

I think In the 10 minutes we were in line they powered through 100 orders. It was busy but you can tell there was some crowd engineering that went into the workflow of the place.

    "text": "This was our first visit to Yafo Kitchen.  As newbies, we knew going in that this was a \"fast casual\" restaurant, but we were a bit bewildered by the menu and ordering process.  After staring the menuboard for awhile, we finally stepped up to the counter and confessed that this was our first time and we needed a little guidance.  Put simply, imagine a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern version of Chipotle.  It made it easier for me to think of it like that.  We each ordered the bowl and then walked down the line, deciding what ingredients we wanted in it.   They do have pre-designed bowls and entrees, but they cost just as much as building your own, so you may as well get what you want.  I built my own, starting with a combination of rice and bulgar and then topped it with a variety of veggies and flavors, finishing with a \"protein\" of Shawarma chicken.  The combination of flavors was amazing.  I loved every bite, and it was definitely very filling.    As for drinks, they have a soda machine, but they also offer 3 types of juices, which reminded me a bit of the offerings at Viva Chicken (but you can get free refills at Yafo).  I tried the cucumber/lime/mint.  It was delicious.    For a \"fast casual\" restaurant, it's a bit on the high end for pricing, but you do get good quality food, and seemingly lots of it.  We spent $30 on a meal for two.  There's a place on the bill for tipping, which is normally a huge pet peeve of mine.  I didn't mind giving a little extra because the first employee we encountered did a great job of explaining how everything works.  Still...these employees I'm sure aren't getting the standard $2/hour server pay.  They're also not bringing my food TO me.  But I digress...  We got there around 8:30 or so, and they were closing at 9:00 (which seems a bit early).  They were still pretty jam-packed by the time we were leaving, just before 9:00.  Before that, after we sat down to eat, we observed one seemingly disgruntled employee, already turning off the juice machines and getting buckets ready to empty them out.  My partner had already had a grumpy encounter with him when he was trying to get his drink; the employee was standing in front of the drink area blocking everyone's way, not really doing anything at all.  He was also the same employee who grumpily took the plates away from our table.  I said \"thank you,\" but it went without response from Mr. Grumpy Pants.  Look, I'm sorry you're at work, dude, and it's obvious you want to get out of here the way you're closing up shop while there are still a lot of customers in the restaurant, but if you're unhappy with your job, find a new one.    Despite this one employee, everything seemed to run pretty smoothly at Yafo and everyone else seemed happy we were there.  I'm definitely a fan, and we'll be back.    p.s. It looks like Yafo gets its name from a former (ancient) city of west-central Israel on the Mediterranean Sea.",

They have different base for bowls: hummus, rice, couscous, etc. I asked if I could get a 3/4 rice, 1/4 hummus base and the employee was very chill about it. Then, because toppings are unlimited, I got it with cucumber, tomato, the cucumber-tomato salad, beets, feta, red cabbage and sweet onion. All the veggies were sauced in some way where if you ate any of them separately they would be flavorful! I praise the onions because I usually dislike red onions, but the vinegar covered up the tanginess super well. I got pulled lamb as the meat, which honestly reminded me of a sweeter pulled pork. The price is a bit expensive so next time I will probably get chicken. Lastly, I got the mac and cheese (I heard it is made with yogurt)? which is super rich and has a slight crunchy texture because of the breadcrumbs but gives it that baked comfort food feel. I wasn't sure what sauce to get so another employee recommended the orange dressing, similar to chipotle mayo, and told me that it was good to dip mac and cheese in (the mac and cheese is tasty on its own but the flavors do go together). Lastly, as if I hadn't gotten enough food already- it comes with naan! I got a basil strawberry lemonade to top which was refreshing- the basil makes it taste more herbal. All in all, I love the concept of the bowl, but it fills you up super fast and there's a lot going on because all the veggies are flavorful in their own way. My advice would be to have a balance of densely flavored sides and refreshing ones (i.e., the beets.) The restaurant runs pretty efficiently as well, I think there's customers like me that don't know what the menu items are which can slow down the line a bit. But the employees are super helpful with recommendations and I appreciate the service! Definitely not to be missed out on when you go to Charlotte- it hasn't expanded past CLT but I heard there's 3 locations in the city already!",

    "text": "More like Blahfo Kitchen.   While the food isn't necessarily bad, I certainly don't get the hype either.  I've been here twice now.. Once about a year ago and once yesterday. Both times I've opted for the Build Your Own Bowl with Half Salad and Half Hummus. My first visit I added falafel as my protein and remember not being too impressed by it. Yesterday I was stupid enough to add it again. The falafel is some of the blandest, driest chickpea fritters I've ever tried. It was comparable to the disappointing falafel I had at Maoz in NYC a few years back. Not impressed. I will say that the hummus was very good & the salad was very fresh. They have an interesting variety of toppings & I've added pickled onions, olives, a chickpea mixture, & a tomato/cucumber mixture to my bowl both times, with some lemon herb vinaigrette. It's kinda dumb that the toppings aren't labeled so you just have to point at everything when you order. Also that's probably why the line can get so long. I'm sure it gets backed up because customers have questions about the ingredients, etc. Most of it is pretty good though & I can get a couple of meals out of my bowl. I do also like the laffah bread that's served on the side. It's pillowy and warm. Their falafel still sucks though.   Also their \"mezzes\" annoy me for some reason. First because you don't know what they are until you get up to the counter. Second because they have stuff like mac & cheese as a mezze (really??) but no stuffed grape leaves! What's a Middle Eastern/Greek restaurant without that as a mezze! I get that they can serve whatever they want on their menu but I'm just surprised those were left out.   I'm sure I'll be back but only if a friend suggests it and shoots down my other ideas first. I just need to remember to never add the falawful!",

We stopped in on a Saturday evening and there was a great vibe to it. It's been on my bucket list for a while.   Some of my favorite parts: - Build your own bowl (you can get certain toppings, like grains, hummus or tzatziki, vegetables, olives, chickpeas included automatically). It's a great way to try a little bit of everything! There is an upcharge for other toppings, such as beets, avocados, cheeses, falafels, and other meats/proteins. - They are very generous with portion sizes - They have some fantastic dressing combo's. My favorites were the mint vinaigrette and the tahini.  - Everyone is friendly, tables are clean, service is great  My only complaint would be the location of the bathroom. It is extremely inconvenient to get to, and difficult to navigate around the ordering line to walk to the bathroom, which is in the far back corner of the restaurant.   Everything else was fantastic and the service was top notch. We had two managers come check on us to ensure we had everything we needed and someone took our tray away immediately after sitting.",

As a first time visitor, the biggest downside is that getting my food was a bit daunting. While I am no stranger to greek food, it was very unique to see so much in front of my and decide what was going to go into a single bowl. I decided pretty quick that my strategy was to just get everything I wanted without worrying about how it was going to go together and I have no regrets.   I ended up with a rice bowl packed with everything from hummus to tabbouleh to stuffed grape leaves and olives and so much more. Somehow, everything worked together. To top it off, I really felt like I had a bowl filled with real food. Everything was healthy except for the portion - the bowl was massive and it was loaded.  Perhaps my favorite part of the experience was watching the flat bread hand made while we were in waiting to order. Fresh bread is great. Bread that was made while you were ordering is even better.",

As mentioned in my previous review, I haven't had Yafo in a while but I finally had it again today.   The laffah is still a problem. Today, the consistency is decent but the taste is off. Weirdly sweet but mostly tasteless overall.    The new problem is that other kitchen items taste different. The tahini is far more bitter, leading to bitter hummus. The tabbouleh is extremely sour. Same goes for the grape leaves. Put all of those extreme flavors together and nothing really paired well like it did before.  On the plus side, my portion was much bigger than usual. However, I would trade that in for how Yafo's food used to taste in a heartbeat.",

The recipes and menu were created by Chef Einat Admony (who has 3 NYC restaurants and a food truck).  The actual execution of this deliciousness is taken care of by Executive Chef Shai Fargian (also Israeli) - he even stopped at our table during our meal to make sure everything was to our liking - pretty cool!  Everything is made in house and fresh (local and organic ingredients) including the Laffah Bread and Falafel - both of which are incredible by the way! Laffa is kind of like pita but better - and when it's fresh from the oven - whoa! The falafel, I dare say is perfect - not oily/greasy, great crunch, great flavor!!  You can order a grain bowl or a wrap with anything from shawarma to lamb. We ordered a chicken shawarma bowl to split and a tray of 5 Mezze (side dishes). Everything was amazing. You can choose from hot or cold Mezze. We tried pickled vegetables, brussel sprouts with dates, Israeli Couscous, roasted cauliflower and beets with pistachios and goat cheese.  I would eat anything off the menu - it's just all so well done that it is mind boggling!  House made teas with different flavors and flair - about eight local beers on tap including - OMB, Triple C and Birdsong!  I can't even remember what color the chairs/booths were or if there was any artwork on the walls! That's how much attention you'll be giving the food!!!",

I had the Chicken Shawarma Grain Bowl and loved it. It was bursting with flavor. I had a choice of quinoa and jasmine rice and went with the rice. I couldn't resist ordering a side of Falafels and was really pleased with them. They were not dry like a lot of other places that serve them. They are smaller in size so maybe that is contributing factor.  My friends had the roast chicken, shawarma wrap, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts. Everything was incredible. I love there is another place in Charlotte that now does fantastic brussel sprouts.  It is fast casual dining so it is really easy for everyone to go through the line, order what you want and then find a table or get it to go. Knowing that (different from Scibelli's other creations), I can visit a lot more often when I am eating by myself or need to grab something quickly.  They had a lot of delicious looking sides and mezzes so the hardest part will be deciding what to eat next time I visit. Everything was reasonably priced and I can be filled for $9-16 depending on if I get sides and such.",

    "text": "This place is right up my alley so I had a very difficult time deciding what to get. It was a toss up between the falafel wrap or the bowl. After talking to a few of the employees they steered me towards the BYO option. You can do a salad, bowl, wrap or half n half.   I got the half n half bowl ($8.99) with chicken added (+$2). The bowl came with a generous portion of jasmine rice and hummus. You can also pick between couscous, tzatziki or baba ganoush. For toppings I kept it very simple and went with the cucumber tomato salad and chicken. I know that's basic, but next time I will venture out. They have about 7 toppings included within the original $8.99 price, but also a variety of other toppings (avocado, beets, roasted cauliflower) for an additional price.   The bowl was amazing! The hummus was smooth and probably one of the best I've ever had. The cucumber salad was a nice touch and I drizzled a little tzatziki on top of it! Even my husband enjoined it! The bonus is that I didn't feel like crap after eating it. It was heathy, filling and damn good!   My husband got the 1/4 chicken with brussel sprouts and Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was out of this world. It's made with Greek yogurt and it was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I highly recommend getting it as your side.   However they real reason I gave this place a 5 is because the executive chef came out at the end of our meal and thanked us for coming in. He also asked if there was anything else they could do to improve our visit- the answer was no. Yafo was great and I will be returning again soon!!",

I love the build-your-own concept, especially because you can do a \"Half and Half Bowl\" which makes it easier to choose between salad, grain, hummus, etc. The staff were extremely accommodating and even let me do a \"Thirds Bowl\" with baba ghanoush, hummus, and salad.  All of the toppings were really delicious, although it's easy to rack up quite the bill due to additional add-ons for certain items. It gets above the $10 mark quickly, but I thought the food was better than most sit-down restaurantsin the $$ range here in Charlotte. The laffah bread served with your bowl is mouth-watering AMAZING and I couldn't get over the wonderful combo of flavors in my bowl. All the ingredients tasted fresh and nourishing, but I was still very stuffed afterward.  I can't wait to go back and try more combinations here. The value and quality is unbelievable!",

Every time I go, I find myself setting at the table and taking that first bite and just dying with happiness.  We visited Yafo Kitchen in its opening weeks and watched the head chef working tirelessly to make things happen - we were impressed.  That feeling has never faced.  The ingredients always taste (and look) fresh, the combinations you can make offer more variety than you could imagine, oh and it helps that they give you free bread and don't judge when I mispronounce things and have to make requests like \"yeah, the purple one? Thank you!\" It doesn't seem so strange to be a vegetarian, vegan or anything else here.  This is our GO TO spot when bringing non plant based family members out to eat, too.  I can't say enough good things!",

The chicken was not so good... very salty and I am not sure if it was great quality, vs. a Purdue type bird. .(I buy chicken from Whole Foods and Earthfare... ) From other reviews, I imagine something was off last night.)

The servers move so fast that some lacked the time to tell you what is what, so be familiar with your choices before you go or read the menu as you wait in line.  Some of the line servers are really friendly and will help you,  others not so much. I would suggest they label the options to make picking what you want a lot easier.",

Plus, they have this super delicious watermelon lime juice that the general manager said is made fresh every day. It's even better than I thought it could be, which was already a high bar. To top it off, the staff were all very friendly, offering up samples of the shawarma and sides. They really capped off a great dining experience. Can't wait to return!

    "text": "I have been to Yafo's three times and based on the delicious food choices this would be one of my family's favorite restaurants.  But the extremely poor customer service I have had each time unfortunately far outweighs the menu choices.    There are so many selections and all of the servers aren't willing to answer questions about what is available.  It's almost like they have been on the \"assembly line\" so long that they just want to get you through as quickly as possible.  All questions were answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\" response and they weren't willing to elaborate.  I felt as if I was bothering them so I just did my best to choose items on my own.  The absolute worst service was from the woman at the register.  She didn't greet us, seemed bothered getting us the sauces we requested (they come with the meal), didn't make any eye contact and didn't even thank us at the end of the transaction.  I would like to say maybe she was having a bad day but she has been there all three times and I've watched her with other customers.  We were also charged for three drinks and when we asked for cups she gave us water glasses which we filled up with juices and felt like we were going to be called out for stealing but didn't want to \"bother\" her again.   Growing up in the restaurant business I know the importance of excellent customer service.  The initial greeting and the \"thank you\" at the end are very important. My advice is to get rid of the poor employees who obviously don't want to be there or retrain them and expect more from them.   I am very surprised I have only seen one other comment about the service, is everyone else ok with the way you are treated here?    My adult children and husband were with me and were so upset by the way we were treated that none of them will return.  We hope things get better but since all of our friends have decided not to go back because of the service we may never know!",

    "text": "Went there for lunch with coworkers.  I ordered the Shawarma and found it very tasty.  I'm not as experiened with this style of food to critique.  Interestingly, the vibe I was getting was this place is attempting to be the Zoe's or Chipotle of this type of food.  Can't really pin it down, though.  Nevertheless, the lunch was good and I was plenty filled up and my coworkers seemed pleased.",

    "text": "It's the newest hot spot in the South Park area!  I've had various people tell me to check this place out.  I finally did for a lunch adventure.  Luckily, I came with someone who has been here before, and we came before the lunch crowd which starts around 12pm on the weekend.  I was overwhelmed (in a good way) by all the options and choices you have.  I ended up getting a half rice and half lettuce bowl.  Then you choose from a bunch of different ingredients to add.  I tried it all and added some chicken at the end.  The bowl you get is huge, but it was so good that I ate it all.  The staff that work there are super nice and helpful too.  I highly recommend this place!",

Our current favorites (Kebab J in Matthews and Jasmine in South Park) weren't enough, Mediterranean is my 2nd favorite and requested meal.  The parking hasn't been a problem on the two weekend days we've gone and every single thing we've ordered has been delicious and fresh (except, the potatoes-just meh and not worth the purchase, didn't even finish them.)  All brussels sides have been incredible (double points for the dates!), hummus is wonderful, yogurt mac and cheese heavenly and between our trips we enjoyed rotisserie chicken, wraps and salads all to our delight.  Here it is 2pm on a Tuesday and I'm counting the minutes until I can go back for dinner.",

We've been here at least 3 times since they opened and everything we have had is amazing: falafel side, dip trio, Marrakesh lamb grain bowl, chicken shawarma wrap, chicken grain bowl, and chicken salad bowl. The chickpea salad is awesome, and the cilantro jalapeno sauce is a must have. Oh and get extra bread, you'll want it!",

It would be good for some of the daily sides to have more detailed descriptions (I was disappointed to realize that my Brussels sprouts were full of raw onion, which isn't my thing). And the hummus was a little salty for my liking. But the grilled chicken used in their dishes was spectacular and I can't wait to taste more of what they have to offer. Definitely a new favorite in the area - I'll be back!",
