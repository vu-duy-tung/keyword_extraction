    "text": "Yes! Yummi Banh Mi truck is awesome and a welcomed addition to the charlotte food truck scene. I recommend trying the lemongrass pork on either a sandwich or rice bowl. The marinade they use has such a great flavor, especially compared to the other crisp, fresh toppings.   A huge plus for me is how genuinely friendly and enthusiastic the staff is. If you've never had vietnamese food, they are excited to tell you about their products. They chat with you and get you know you while you wait. It's overall a great food truck experience.   I usually check to see if the truck is nearby when I'm getting snackish. Check it out!",

It is shredded pork in a delicious gooey citrus marinade. Topped with lemon grass, cilantro, shaved cucumber and carrot. Slapped on a perfect baguette. It is so incredible that i have never had anything else from the truck and probably will never try anything else. i look forward to wolfing this sandwich down every week. I never get full though. Portions should be bigger. I usually catch them next to Romare Bearden Park Uptown",

The light lemongrass vinaigrette just brought the marriage of this delicious bowl together!! Thanks for a Yummi lunch! Until we meet again!",

It's a very generous bowl of rice, meat, and veggies. The pork was yummy with great flavor and the veggies were very good as well. I wish the rice were stickier, it was a little too much on the soft side. If they perfect the rice, I would give it a solid five starts.  I also wish I hadn't gotten the jalepenos because they are quite hot (duh) and if they get on your fingers, don't rub your nose or your eyes because it hurts like hell. The limeade was very tasty too and goes great with the meal. The guy who owns the truck is a super nice guy, very personable and welcoming. It was fun to order our food and then go sit in the park and eat. I think he has a win here.",

I usually hit it up when it parks at the Element Uptown (next to Romeare Bearden Park - next to the 7-Eleven) on Tuesdays for lunch.  So great to have great food and to have a nice park to consume it in.  You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've had a little bit of everything and I have not been disappointed.  Their flavors pack a punch... and some heat (if you don't mind the fresh peppers sliced into your sandwich, tacos, or rice bowl).   My favorite is the BBQ Pork....  The guys working the truck are super friendly and just sling out good food.  Luckily my lunch break is later than most folks so I hit them up around 1pm and there isn't a line, but usually they have some war stories of the line stretching out really long, but I think with this new Tuesday stop, people are starting to figure out their schedules and staggering their visits.  A number of beverages are available in a cooler: sodas and even asian drinks (which I have yet to try) maybe next time.  Will always be looking out for the tan truck with a giant pac-man logo wearing an asian style conical hat.",

Basically you choose your protein - chicken, beef, tofu and a few other options and select your vessel - of either a roll (Banh Mi), Taco, or Bowl.  Being health conscious (except for the beer), I went with a tofu bowl.  It came with cucumbers, carrots, daikon, rice and what I assume was fish sauce.  For a food truck, it was decent food.  It was better when I added Sirracha sauce. It really needed the heat.  Still not bad for a first experience with this truck. And definitely a nice addition to the local food truck scene.",

I wish I could tell you what he said about them, but I was too busy inhaling mine to care.  That said, the only reason I didn't go full 5 stars was because the fella's taco portions were tiny. I was glad I got the sandwich because I'd still be starving if I got the tacos, and considering they were the same price, you'd think they'd be about the same size.

Their sandwiches pack more meat than other bahn mi sandwich shops around Charlotte. The bread was perfect, nice and crispy and just enough to hold it together. Meat was flavorful and well cooked. Veggies were perfect and fresh, balanced it all out.",

We were lucky to catch up with them at the food truck rally in Matthews.    My husband got the lemongrass beef sandwich and the Asian in me was compelled to get BBQ pork Vietnamese rice bowl....delicious! I highly suggest ordering the egg on top of the sandwich (got this little nugget of info from one of the yelp reviews). The meal came with a ramekin of sauce. We weren't sure what it was or even what meal it was supposed to go with so we didn't ask questions and dumped it over the rice bowl. It complemented the dish well without over powering it.    This place is worth following to its next destination. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "So, I'm no Banh Mi expert, but I'm in love with this food truck. We were at Sycamore Brewing Sunday afternoon, Yummi Banh Mi was parked outside. This was exactly what I wanted on a Sunday afternoon, and a nice compliment to my beer. The wait was short (yay) and the food was prepared timely (double yay).   I ordered the bbq pork banh mi sandwich (8 dollars), and it was well worth it!. The bread was amazing, it tasted fresh and was nice and crusty on the outside. All the toppings that come with it (jalepenos, pickled carrots, cilantro) were fresh and tasty! Oh and how could I forget the pork?? It was sooo delicious. When you hear of \"bbq pork\" (at least in the south), you usually think of pulled pork. Well at least I do...This is NOT that. It's more like grilled pork pieces (like the pork I've gotten at Vietnamese restaurants). SO SO GOOD.    Please park outside of my house and make me sandwiches. I seriously could eat this sandwich everyday..   I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but everything looked good from what I've seen!",

Unfortunately, they were sold out of the Lemongrass Pork, my first choice. My alternate, the Lemongrass Chicken, I'd say made up for it; all the right flavors, cradled in fresh, crispy bread, hitting all the right notes on my taste buds.   Solid product, quick service but a little pricier than the \"brick and mortar\" competition and who runs out of napkins.....  Look forward to trying the pork in the future and maybe one of their rice bowls!",

We first were headed 85 N when we stopped by their restaurant in Salisbury. The owner Scott was in the kitchen cooking ( that's what you love to see in local eats). I ordered the Vietnamese fried rice bowl with lemongrass shrimp and a fried egg to finish it ( like it was recommended on their Instagram page). IT WAS AWESOME. Make sure to order a side of spring rolls ( or maybe 2 sides if you plan on sharing).  2 weeks later, Yummi Banh Mi posted that it was their trucks last venture out for the year. We hopped in the car, drove to Sycamore Brewing in the rain and ordered the same thing, again besides the spring rolls. Scott was on the truck with his bursting personality. He was thrilled to hear that we had been to his location in Salisbury. I look forward to venturing to the truck in the New Year and congratulations on another baby girl!",

They do a great job of  providing well seasoned flavorful meats and I think on my first few visits I would always get the chicken until they guy taking my order mentioned that the bbq pork was the best and he was so right on that recommendation.

I just prefer my bahn mi on a a baguette vs. a French roll. The meat was seasoned properly but it was just too much bread for me. For me the BBQ pork is greater than the lemongrass pork.  The rice bowl was banging. I added a fried egg, and should have asked if they could have left it runny. This would have made my rice bowl perfect. The pork was cooked well and seasoned righteously.

My buddies and I were on our way down to Charleston for our friend's wedding and needed liquid caffeine (aka coffee aka the nectar of cacao) for the 3.5 hour drive. We literally parked behind the Yummi Banh Mi food truck and that's when I realized it was destiny for me to order something. We were in the Third Ward neighborhood of Charlotte.   Initially walking past it, the truck was closed. It opened at 11 a.m. and we got there around 10:40 a.m. I stood and stared at the menu for a good 4 minutes before one of the workers came out and said \"Hey man, we'll be open soon, so you'll get your banh mi soon!\" We went to the Starbucks and got some coffee. I thought the coffee would quell my hunger for the banh mi, but it only amplified it. I went back out and there was already a dude standing to get his food. It was 10:52 a.m. I knocked on the door of the truck and the worker came out and said he could take my order. Score!  I ordered the Lemongrass Pork Banh Mi. For a $7.50 price tag, the sandwich was pretty pricey but delicious nonetheless. Pork was seasoned well and it came with pickled carrots, cucumbers, and 2 pieces of jalapenos.   A+ for the customer service, A for the food, A- for the price, and A-mazing for the yellow theme truck with the bomb ass logo!",

Yesterday I tried their rice bowl and it was also really nice. It has good flavor and the rice had a great texture to it that made the bowl very enjoyable. For all you spice lovers, I'd ask for some extra sriracha!  The only thing I have left to try are the tacos and I'm betting they're pretty good. This is a great go-to food truck and I definitely recommend!",

This means I've had plenty of time to try the food in Charlotte and it goes without saying that there is a ton of it. This food truck is my favorite place I've tried so far. The food is amazing. It's delicious,  very fresh and very visually appealing as well. What stands out as much as the food though is the service. The people that work on this truck are genuinely nice and fun to talk to. In fact, last time I ate here my card got declined for some reason and the young lady told me that I could just pay for it next time I came back. All the food is great but I recommend the lemon grass beef rice bowl. Even though I'm usually more of a chicken man...*bagok*",

I had been telling the people in my office about it so today I place my order via email and went and picked up lunch for several of us here and they all loved it. I can't say good enough things about yall's food.",

    "text": "Confession: I'm pretty much obsessed with these guys and their truck. How could you not be? Solid food and a truck with a giant Asian Pac Man on it? Sign me up all day.  My first Yummi Banh Mi experience was during a NoDa FAM event and the line was a mile long. Okay, maybe it wasn't a mile. I have poor depth perception. But, it was long and a long wait for food. This was back when they were first starting. Add to that: everyone wanted to try out the cool looking new truck. I remember being annoyed and thinking this better be worth it. I went with one of the rice bowls. It didn't look like a lot of food until you started eating, but tt was so filling and delicious. I was hooked.   So what should you order? I don't think you can go wrong with any of it. I've had the rice bowls, tacos, and the banh mi sandwiches. The BBQ pork and the lemongrass options are all delicious. There is also tofu, if you're into that kind of thing. It's hard for me to order now because I really do like them all. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone who works on the truck is super nice.   How to find them? Follow them on the social medias. They post their schedule each week. Congrats to Scott on all his success so far. The Observer just did a great story on him and the truck a couple weeks ago. Nice to see good people doing well.",

Lol...The meat was well-seasoned....they gave me enough jasmine rice and veggies. The food truck staff asked me if I wanted to add the egg on top ( yolk uncooked), but I'm not gangsta like that...not yet. I definitely recommend Yummi Banh Mi and their rice bowls as well!!!",
