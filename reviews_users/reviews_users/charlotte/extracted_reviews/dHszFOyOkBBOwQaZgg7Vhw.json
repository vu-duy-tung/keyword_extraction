The rice, beans and plantains were done right as well. I used a coupon deal and would come again without a coupon",

This was fantastic though!   I had the ceviche and it was fantastic! I also had some other dish that I can't remember but it was also great.  My suggestions if this is your first time would be to try something new and you'll definitely enjoy it.  The spicy is very spicy, like sweating up a storm spicy.  The staff is pleasant so be sure to leave them a great tip.  Prices were fair and the portions were generous.",

We had a delicious and moist tamal with a yummy onion salsa, followed by aguadito de pollo (chicken and rice soup with lime, carrots, peas and hominy).

We ordered calamari,rellena,1/2 chicken and arroz chafas.  Unfortunately they were out of the 1/2 chicken so we asked for 2 arroz chafas instead.  Calamari were ok,the breading is a little bit too greasy for me and it lacks of spices. it comes with 4 creamy dipping sauces , the fried yucca were really plain and dry,I'm not a fan.   The rellena is like a ground beef stuffed potato cake,my partner liked it. It's alright for me,because I'm not a fan of ground beef,but the flavor is there.  The arroz chafas is like fried rice dish, it comes with fried plantains too. It reminds me of thai fried rice, which it's a good thing, it is really delicious!!!! Nom !   I would totally recommend the arroz chafas! Probably skip the calamari and the fried yucca.",

When I later asked for a glass of water I received just that: a glass of water. No ice. Later I noticed the couple behind us being delivered their entrees. The woman waited a few minutes then called her waitress over. It turned out she had received my meal. Which was then removed from her table and then delivered to me. Unsanitary. Later we had to ask three times before receiving our check. Finally it arrived, and our plates, along with my unfinished drink, were removed. I had to yell across the room to ask the waiter to return my drink. Horrible experience.",

    "text": "I honestly love the food here but what kills me is the lack of structure on running the restaurant and customer service here at this establishment. My boyfriend and i have been long time customers of this restaurant from the days when they were located off of E Independence and have always loved their food. However after my past few dining experiences here haven't been the greatest so I'm going to back off for a bit.  What brought it home for me on backing off of this place was when i went to grab lunch last Sunday there with my girlfriends. We walk in the doors and the front lobby was packed full of people. There was no hostess to be found anywhere to even help direct the traffic of people. Everyone was scattered everywhere just anxiously waiting to be seated or have their name put down on a wait list. Hell no one knew where the line began or ended, people were just making their own lines.  From the time i walked in to the time i finally got to put my name down on a wait list was literally about 10 mins of just waiting for a hostess to greet us. The hostess was fine with my group, but i watched her interactions with other customers and it made me cringe. She was rude and would have an attitude towards them. We were told it'll be a 25 min wait which ended up being 45 mins but who's keeping count haha. I could tell the frustration grew with other clients as well because the hostess would come out and then go missing for long periods of time. Some people weren't even greeted as they were standing there waiting and waiting.  Again no form of structure and it drives me off the walls because i come from working in restaurants. It's just unprofessional and poor customer service. For the 45 mins that i waited to be seated, I literally watched people walk in and walk out because again no staff to be found to greet them or inform them of what's going on. I would see them stand there for 5 to 10 mins and then just walk out because they couldn't deal with the madness Fast forwarding to when we finally get seated, our \"hostess\" ended up also being our server which was just madness to me. Hence why she would go missing for long periods of time since she was \"hostessing\" and \"serving\". On that note, service was just slow, our orders got messed up. My girlfriend and i spoke up and our server/hostess had the audacity if we still wanted our order corrected. I was just so taken back by the ignorance.  Again, i dont necessarily take the mentality that the customer is always right but seriously?!?! If you made the mistake then fix it, point blank. I just couldn't believe she was seriously asking my girlfriend if she still wanted her side that she didn't receive. Like hello we're paying for it and if we ordered it then yes i would like what we ordered. As i keep repeating just the lack of customer service kills me.  Anywho, it was 2 hr lunch that was honestly a waste of time. I wish i listened to my gut and had gone elsewhere to dine cause honestly all we received was ok food and hands down horrible customer service. They have some serious issues to work on so until they get all their kinks worked out, I'm backing the hell off for a long while on dining here.",

    "text": "Eating here made me miss Miami big time. Saturday at lunch it was pretty busy with an all-Hispanic crowd (I think more Central American than Peruvian) with lots of kids eating chicken and french fries everywhere.  But I came for the Ceviche, and that's what I ordered. Ceviche mixto $14.50 (South Beach prices on S. Polk street?) medium spicy please  The traditional complimentary basket with fried  pan de Yuca was served quickly - if you're not familiar with it the best way I can describe it is like fried dough, like a sugarless beignet with yellow chili sauce to dip it in.    Bad start, the dough was chewy, greasy, lukewarm, old ... in a word awful - I didn't subtract a star because after all it's a freebie.  Ceviche is supposed to be as freshly made as possible, in fact the better restaurants prepare it only after you order. Here it had been sitting the fridge for days. The fish was mealy, the shrimp had the consistency of an overcooked limp noodle, the calamare and octopus was harder than leather, even the leaf of lettuce it was served on was the most wilted lettuce I've ever seen. Even the potatoes were old, I couldn't even recognize the taste of the sweet potato and had to ask if indeed that's it was. And the medium was very mild.   I'm awarding it 2 stars because the Tigre de Leche sauce was pretty good - not great - and someone could  eat a meal here and enjoy if they're not picky.  No way that this type was an isolated incident, just by looking at the photos of the Jalea here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FgkmZl8WuIzVUGBLCbOIVSA%2Fl.jpg&s=7aa9d8aee39063a597520630b850b5636f74609353a17edb6237fd773cd22cba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>   you can tell it was fried to death.

I was a fan of it when it was in independence (a not so nice area) It moved to Pineville and I still think its worth the trip, specially because the ceviche here is the best you will find in Charlotte. I do not like Genaro's cevhice I feel like they are tricking people on believing thats the actual ceviche.. and ITS NOT. Go to Machupicchu and you will taste the closest to our real ceviche. I love most of the dishes in Machu Picchu, my favorite are the pan de yucca (yums) and the sauces, ceviche and chaufa de mariscos.  I just wish they would open another restaurant close to uptown Charlotte (with this much variety of options)",

Ordered the Tallarin Verde, Bistec a la pobre, an order of yuca bread, and a cup of Chicha which is an ethnic Peruvian Drink. So lets begin with the Tallarin Verde, the flavor was good, but the type of pasta used was not my favorite and a bit on the soggy side, they add chicken to it but, I do not like meat. The Bistec a la Pobre looked decent, but the taste tester (yeah, im so fancy, I have taste testers) Subject stated the Bistec or the steak was not good, actually on the hard to chew side and lacking in flavor. The rice was not very nice on the palate, either. The only good things were the french fries and the fried plantains. Moving on to the Yuca bread, that is the reason why I might come back to this place, only for the Yuca bread, hmmm nummy! Hey you got something right! The Chicha was pretty good, but come on, if you can't make Chicha, then there is no way you are a True Peruvian Restaurant.",

Arroz chaufa was good. Inka cola though . You always need one of those.  The food came out super fast that's why I gave it a 3.",

A lot of selections in their menu. Had the shrimp in garlic sauce appetizer that's also served with yucca. So yummy, we finished to the last morsel and even scraped off the sauce. My hubby lives ceviche and he tried the fried ceviche...he loved it! There are a lot more varieties to try so we are definitely coming back. I had the tacu tacu with seafood. Really tasty! Finished it as well. For drinks, pisco sour, of course! A little pricey at 9 bucks, considering half of the glass was ice We had no more room for dessert but we shall return!!",

Machu Picchu is one of the restaurants that had maintained the taste of peruvian cuisine. I would recommend for breakfast a large plate (for 2) that resembles a morning in Lurin. Their ceviche is fresh and tasteful with Peruvian corn. I also recommend the \"pescado frito \" with a bean portion. For desert many people ask for their alfajores, best in town! But If you wanna eat light, like I normally do go for anticuchos and picarones, which are my preferred dishes in the menu.  Prices are reasonable for Peruvian food and they have many very tasty dishes and great service.",

    "text": "This place came recommended before they moved from the east side of town to Pineville.  After reading the other reviews, I finally decided to check this out on my own.  Thankfully something decent replaced the horrible Mexican place that used to occupy this space. The decor has not changed much inside except for there is now a photo of Machu Picchu on the wall.  There is also a counter up front where they sell what I assume to be Peruvian foods.    The menu is broad.  I was gravitating toward the rotisserie chicken but that's what my server recommended as well.  So I ordered that, plantains and a salad.  Service was good although I could barely hear my server as she spoke quietly and I was sitting near one of the music speakers.    I was presented with these miniature croissants with a spicy sauce that were quite good.  After I finished both of those, my meal arrived.  The chicken was juicy but I couldn't really taste the flavors of the spice rub.  The sauces were a bit watery but were similar to Genaro's.  The salad was unappealing and was primarily made up of iceberg lettuce and onions but it was tolerable by adding the green dipping sauce.  The best thing about the meal was the plaintains.   They were plentiful and flavorful.  Perhaps I should have tried something else but if chicken is their specialty then I think you can do better at Genaro's down the road.    So I think this place is worth about a 2.75 so I'll round it up to a 3.",

As soon as we were seated and given the menus,  a basket of what looked like chorros was put on the table with a bowl of sauce.  The chorros were cold and stale.    We ordered appetizers,  the tamal tasted good but had chicken bones in it.  The other appetizer was supposed to be Peruvian choclo (large kernaled corn) with feta cheese. They brought out unflavored corn and fresh cheese cut into cubes.   Next was the entree. My husband ordered tallarrin saltado with steak,  and it was deliciuos. My order was ceviche (fish), and what they brought was not ceviche. It was raw fish that smelled spoiled with no onions or cilantro or flavor. This was the first time in my life that I sent my plate back to the kitchen.  Maybe if they find another cook it will get better,  but we are not planning to ever return to this restaurant.",

Other reviews state that the service is a bit slow- but to me that was fine- we didn't want to be rushed! And I'm not even sure I would say \"slow\".... More like casual and UN-hurried- which is exactly how things should be! The restaurant is clean and well maintained. Light Latin music playing- not too loud.

Also had yucca fries and canary beans. The beans were great but the yucca fries were out of this world - crispy outside and creamy inside. Not to go on and on but this place was terrific. I will definitely return and when I do I am going to come hungry and get the half chicken. The quarter that I had was good for lunch but I want more - the half chicken.",

    "text": "It started out promising when we were greeted with a knowledgable host, then waited on by someone else. The decor is simple. There is some hot hominy kernels they put on the table. Not for me. My Pisco sour was citrusy, a little sweet and sour and delicious. I ordered a Tamal and a Papa Relleno. My Papa Relleno  came out piping hot and was nicely seasoned, with beef inside, filled with creamy mashed potatoes. I asked about a sauce, that I was supposed to have gotten and she brought out a tiny Salsa Criollo, definitely not the big one in the pic. Same for the tamal, which was dry and tasteless, definitely NOT  GENEROUSLY filled. I ordered the pork tamal and it had 2 small, dry pieces and about 3 or 4 pieces of pork fat. Gross. Baldie had Tacu Tacu con Lomo Saltado. Steak with fries and tomatoes and onions with some kind of fried beans. The bean thing was delicious. I don't know why they asked Frank how he liked his steak because it came out well done anyway and a little chewy. It was good, don't get me wrong, he ate the SHIT out of it, but not the best. New York on a Main Street In Port Chester, where all the Peruvian restaurants are, has the best Peruvian food. Overall, it was good. I'd go again and try something different.",

Poor management. I avoid going to Viva chicken or any Colombian rotisserie restaurant just to have a different dining experience and I did not get it. Total disappointment with the Machu Pichu Peruvian rotisserie chicken.",

I can't wait to go back and try more here!",

    "text": "This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" takes us to Pineville to Machu Picchu, Peruvian Cuisine, named after the ancient Inca City near Cusco, Peru. Now I can truly say, I have never had Peruvian food, but I am always up for trying something new and my wife was in an adventurous mood. Dora here. Haha!   Just inside, we noticed pictures of some of the menu items on the wall and a picture page was included with the menu. This was especially helpful for us to understand the menu. Dora here. I noticed something else. The pungent aroma of seafood. And the interior is quite dim.  I chose the Arroz Con Mariscos which consisted of yellow rice cooked with an assortment of seafood, mixed vegetables and spices. This dish was very good, not too spicy but very moist and tasty, and packed with perfectly cooked seafood. It would have been great if they reduced the massive portion size and included one of the interesting side items from the menu like fried plantains or yucca.   Dora ordered Bisteck Apanado, lightly breaded deep-fried steak served with white rice and French fries. The star of this dish was the deep-fried steak, which had the right amount of breading, juicy, and so good. It was strange that this dish was served with both white rice and French fries. Dora here. This steak reminded me of Palomilla steak, my favorite dish from when we lived in Tampa. Tender and tasty, and I'd definitely order it again!    We opted for dessert instead of an appetizer this trip. At our waiter's recommendation, we chose Alfajores, two shortbread cookies with Dulce de leche in the middle sprinkled with powdered sugar. A nice way to end the meal, just the right amount of crunch and not sweet. The dessert case was full of them, so obviously they sell a bunch.   I would rate this establishment 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.",

It took us a minute to get seated because the lobby is difficult for the staff to see if no one's in there, and the ambiance is seriously lacking (think dimly/oddly-lit fish camp), but I appreciate the Peruvian movie being shown and the mural of Machu Picchu on the wall.  Our waitress was really sweet but knew nothing about wine. They were out of the first two the fella ordered, so he asked for just any white wine, and she pointed to the Pinot Noir. Thankfully, she asked a gentleman (the manager?) to help out, and he was really knowledgeable.  I got the rotisserie chicken with yucca and plantains (mmmm... plantains). The chicken was good but maybe a smidgen dry, but the yucca and plantains were heavenly. The fella got the Ceviche de Camarones, and he was pleasantly surprised by how good the sweet potato and Peruvian corn were. He said the shrimp was good, too, but there was a little too much juice. (The menu says lime juice, but he said it tasted like lemon juice.)  There were quite a few other parties there on a Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m., which I was surprised by and glad to see. Since it's in a weirdo Food Lion strip mall, it put us off, but the food is definitely worth coming back for.",

The servers and waitstaff are so friendly and immediately greet you upon arrival. The inside is lit pretty dimly and includes a full bar. If you have a large group or a party of two, there's plenty of space to accommodate you. In terms of large parties, they prepare food and meals 'family style' so lots of sharing can be done.  I personally recommend trying the Peruvian beverages, both non and alcoholic. I've tried the chicha morada (purple corn juice drink) and the mango/passion fruit flavor. I found the original chicha morada to be a tad too syrupy sweet but the mango/passion fruit flavor was/is delicious. Also, if you're in the mood for an alcoholic Peruvian beverage, go for the Pisco Sour. Tart and delicious. Goes down a little too smoothly.  As for the food, my favorites include the plaintains which are sweetly charred, the arroz con chaufa(very similar to Chinese chicken fried rice), and there's a beef dish that I completely forget the name of but is served with peppers and potatoes.  The menu is quite extensive and there's something bound to please every taste bud in your group.",

Sent it back and went with water.  Elsa grabbed a margarita, it was way too sweet.  It gave her a sugar rush instead of a buzz.    I ordered a milk for my little guy, that didn't come out at all, was then told they didn't have any. Ordered apple juice instead.  No big deal.  I ordered the bistek encebollado. 14.99.  This is why I'm giving 2 stars.  The steak was underwhelming. The meal is basically onions tomatos and rice.  Way overpriced for what it ended up being.   And that not considering how long it took for the food to come out.  Long story short,  this place is overpriced, and the service is slow.  They don't have a kids menu so heads up there as well.

It had just the right amount of lime and I even loved the cancha.  My issue with this place was that they refused to honor my Groupon. At the end of the meal they told me that I needed to order 2 entrees, but nowhere did it say this in the fine print (I read it multiple times beforehand). Groupon refunded my money, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (unlike the food).",

I've never had a ceviche that was so tasteless, the fish was cut into very small pieces and it was lacking that kick, the combination of acidity and spice, that is basic when you eat a decent ceviche. Very disappointing. We were offered some free yuca tempura-style fries at the beginning, that apparently were heated in a microwave since they had the texture of a piece of chewing gum. My friend had a seafood chaufa, which had pieces of uncooked rice and it was not even appealing to the eye. Please don't go to this place if you appreciate good food! I just moved from California where there are several good options for Peruvian restaurants (even though they are never like the ones in Peru); unfortunately, there are not many options around the area that serve fine and a more variety of Peruvian dishes. I hope this changes in the near future.",

I was born and raised in Peru so I am very critic when it comes to Peruvian food.   I lived in California for 15 and was able to find 3-4 great places there.  In North Carolina I have mostly found restaurants that sell \"Peruvian rotisserie chicken\"( which are great) but no good place with a menu offer more Peruvian option.  I wasn't sure what to expect about this place because of the mixed reviews but I have to admit that it was pleasantly surprised. The ceviche was tasty, the tacu tacu with seafood sauce was excellent.  Chicha morada was also good.  The service was fast and it was clean.  The only reason why I didn't give them a 5 star is because the \"papa a la huancaina \" was not very good, it lacked flavor as if it was missing more aji amarillo or something else.  They brought me extra potatoes and a different \"aji amarillo sauce\" to compensate though,  that one was good!   I will definitely come back next time I am in the area.",

I ordered some items to share with my wife and the wait time for the appetizers to come out took over 20 min. A huge pet peeve of mine is reheating food especially in a restaurant in a microwave. My tamale was just that heated in the microwave. When you start to eat it the tamale starts to break. Followed by the papa rellena which was mushy and watery fried potato. Then our entrees came out the chaufun chicken rice and fried seafood platter.  Rice was subpar and overly salty drenched with soy sauce and really no additional flavor to it. The seafood platter was over cooked and extremely chewy. Can't say I really enjoyed my meal. I should have just kept on driving past it. If you enjoy bland and over cooked food this is your place. I was really hoping this meal would have been better and it wasn't.  Wish I could turn back time and keep driving past this place.",

For my meal, I chose to go with the Aji de Gallina, which was a shredded chicken and potato dish that had a really good cilantro and aji Amarillo sauce.

We were never sure if she heard us. We went on Sat and they had entertainment. Not sure if that's regular but it was fun. It's a bit loud because of the music, dj and dancing but not loud enough that kids won t enjoy it. Definitely family friendly and easy parking. Food quality was a 5. For me to give them a 5 I would like the servers to dress the part. Servers look like they rolled out of bed. And a host at the front desk at all times, it took awhile for someone to acknowledge us but none of this hindered our overall experience. Just a few minor improvements.",

    "text": "From 5 star friendliness to 2 star food, what a let down.  Looking to expand our culinary range we thought Machu Picchu might do the trick.  The menu seems extensive but in reality it is a lot of choices with many of the same players coming off the bench (so many carbs: rice, plantains, and fries).  Lori ordered the Jalea Single which is a lightly fried assortment of seafood and white fish served with a side of golden fried yucca, served with salsa criolla.  The white fish was moist and tasty but the rest was basically an overfried assortment of breaded shrimp and calamari straight from the freezer.  The yuca was hard as a brick.  Yuck-a.  My order of BISTEC A LO POBRE: \"A breakfast for kings\" was plentiful but the \"steak\" was merely a tough cut of cube steak that was nearly impossible to carve.  Again, the fries were straight from the freezer bag, and while good, I don't consider $14.95 a lunch bargain with such cheap products.  The winning ingredients were the side sauces and plantains which were excellent.  We decided to order their Mil Hojas dessert which looked enticing.  Described as \"puff pastry filled with dulce de leche\", we struggled to find the filling and basically suffered through a plate of crumbling phillo dough.  Bone dry and tasteless.   At this point we simply stopped ordering--it just kept getting worse.  The staff was wonderful, and the vibe of the place promising; however, I cannot give a recommendation.  Bummer.",

LONG wait until seated and then our server didn't check on us at all. In fact, we had to bother another waitress 3 times in order to get the attention of our own.   The food price wise?  A TAD bit overpriced. 70 bucks for 2 cocktails, 2 plates and an appetizer. Meh. Was tasty though.   Waiteress didn't refill our water when there wasn't a single drop left!  Besides that, food and beverages are a definite hit!  Maybe I'll order take out next time, or.... just be prepared to have a wait. I guess I'll decide when that day comes! :)",

The restaurant was a humble looking Peruvian cuisine in south Charlotte. The interiors was amazing, you will be in awe seeing the huge machu pichu scenic picture on the walls! The tables were somewhat small for an average human. The menu felt like Authentic Peruvian with little or no Americanization. The waitress apologized she knows only Spanish and little English- but she was super helpful and we had fun communicating to her.   The dishes came in after a short wait. The quantity on the plates were barely enough! The fried fish and white rice tasted very bland and with onions side, you would wonder how to eat the food! Lucky we asked for sauces and got some smaller cups of three sauces ( more like the ones you get in Viva chicken). We finally left home wondering if our dinner was pleasant or not!   Would recommend trying here just for the pisco sour drink - haven't been impressed on the food yet!",

The sauce was good but we couldnt get pass the horrific seafood. So we asked for a doggy bag after 3 bites and put it in the garbage on our way out.",

They've updated the menu for optics but the food is mostly the same. Weeknight specials are available like BOGO 1/2 price apps and a small discount on the 1/2 chicken. The prices typically range in the $10-$20. If you order something you don't like the first time, I'd recommend coming back and trying something else. I believe you'll quickly find something to enjoy.  They still have the tv's for futbol but it's never crowded when we've come to just eat. Nothing spectacular with the service but a nice casual dinner suits me perfectly fine.",

She basically is accusing me of stealing 32 dollars from her because chownow refunded me the money for my order. Keep in mind I called chownow right after the incident and let them know about the situation and that I would NOT need my money back as the restaurant already refunded me in cash. Soooo rather than respond to this lady who clearly has a screw loose and has my phone number I called chownow again to confirm they did not issue me a refund. They had to call the restaurant to ask the lady to no longer text me?  This restaurant took crappy service to borderline harassment. If you can see in the first pic the restaurant clearly received the money I paid chownow as reflected in the balance that was paid out to them.",

The 1st thing I noticed when I entered the restaurant was that it had a nice  bright atmosphere of  red and black decor. We were greeted by a very friendly waiter who explained the food on the menu and suggested some dishes for us to try  since we told  him we were new here  . Fried corn kernels were brought to our table as an appetizer . My dining mate ordered the papa rellena- mashed potato puffs filled with ground beef, egg and olives and served with salsa criolla, a red onion , lime and cilantro combo. This was delicious. I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with 2 sides. The chicken was marinated and smoked.  It was tender and delicious. My sides were a salad and sweet potato fries. My dining mate ordered Aji De Gallina, or shredded chicken with a yellow bell pepper sauce  with sliced boiled potatoes and rice. The flavor was mellow and pleasing. The food came out hot, nicely plated, good portions and everything tasty. A bit pricey for some dishes. Menu features a variety of Peruvian, fish, beef, chicken and specialties such as Ceviches, rice  and pasta dishes, soups , appetizers as well as desserts. The variety of sides:, fried plantains, yucca, beans and rice, salads, sweet potato fries, eggs  served any way plus other sides. There is something for everybody here. We will certainly return.",

The waiter took ten minutes to get to us, the food came out cold because he was too busy, another waitress brought it out, I asked for a refill it did not happen, the manager was concerned asked who my waiter was and still no results. Getting the check was a task itself, I had to get up and ask the other waitress could you please get my check. Finally he came and delivered it. When he gave me the check he tried to slip a fast one and put a more expensive dish on the check to bump the automatic added gratuity on the check. What restaurant automatically adds gratuity for a $30 meal? So yeah I caught it, I maybe white looking but I speak Spanish buddy. Def heard your little \"gringo\" comment as I left the restaurant too. Growing up in New York and eating at all the authentic Peruvian restaurants in North Jersey, place is nowhere near as good. Best of luck and I will never return!",

Very Latin America atmosphere which is nice and they start you off with fried corn to munch on while you decide which awesome entree you'll be eating. They have a ton of different options to choose from but the potatoes and rice are consistent with almost all the meals. I give 4 stars because me and my girl friend came here for Valentine's Day dinner which I thought would be a great idea because they're kind of hidden away in pineville and didn't think it would crazy busy. I was right about them not being crazy busy but unfortunately they were crazy slow. Took an hour to get our appetizer and about 30 more minutes after that to get our food when parties of 4 that were seated after us were getting their food way before us.. Just didn't make sense. They still receive 4 stars because the food is amazing here there is no denying that, but the service side has A LOT of room for improvement. Received a free 3 dollar dessert for the wait (which wasn't enough in my opinion) but it is what it is. Maybe I'll do carry out next time and we'll see how that goes!",

I ordered the ceviche and it was amazing!!  We spoke to the server about all of the food we ordered and the owner even came out to talk to us about it.     The service and the food were outstanding.  Our server was very friendly and I was impressed the owner came out to talk to us.  He spent at least 10 minutes at our table talking about different dishes and how they prepare the food (my boyfriend is a big foodie and had a lot of ?'s). As I came on here to write this review, I read another one that said the ceviche was terrible.  I don't know if they went in on a bad day or I went on a good day, but the ceviche was the best I've ever had!  The server also told us that people come in all the time for the ceviche!  My boyfriend had some sort of steak with eggs on top. I forget what else, but we enjoyed everything we ordered.  We decided we will definitely be going here again soon!",

My latest experience with the food there was not a good one so I think I will finally give up on this place. I ordered the seafood ceviche, the calamari was tough felt like I was chewing on rubber, the shrimp were also pretty hard. The dish was just not good at all. My husband ordered another seafood dish (can't remember the name). They brought it out with the rice burned and obviously the seafood had also been terribly overcooked, he left most of the seafood - also not a good dish. They desperately need some sort of quality control in the kitchen. Aside from that the kitchen seems to be located in the front of the restaurant - adjacent to the bar. Maybe someone should tell their cooks to lower the volume on their radio (and maybe their singing voices), there really shouldn't be competition between the kitchen and the music playing for your customers in the dining area.",

The one thing that  have made the experience a perfect 10 was when they have a live Salsa bands on Saturday. Sometimes they have a salsa DJ on Saturday i would call first to ask, good prices on beer buckets. The staff is always extremely friendly  I am so going to try everything on the menu.",

This doesn't happen much in NYC where I come from.   When we go we try to change it up and not order the same food over and over. They have a big selection of Peruvian food. This is one of the best restaurant in the Charlotte area. I've try 2 Peruvian restaurants and is nothing compare to Machu Picchu. I recommended the staff from my kids school. They loved the place and they will go again.  Consider in trying to roasted chicken, lomo saltado, arroz chaufa, el seco, these are all very good tasty foods.

If you've never tried ceviche, the idea of it might put you off but it's well worth trying & sharing. The Papa a la Huancaina (potatoes with a cheese sauce) appetizer is another simple yet tasty dish - also a great vegetarian choice.",
