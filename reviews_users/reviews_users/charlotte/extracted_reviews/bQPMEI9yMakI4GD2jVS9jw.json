Must be slumming from 131 Main as could just about eat at Firebirds for this cost!  Over $30 for two that has a 'decent' burger and fries that look very similar to Ore-Ida Frozen Fries?  I would hesitate going again even if the beef was truly Wagyu/Kobe, but then again, i get 1/2 a cow ground up into hamburger from Frontier Meats annually!  After the typical initial hub bub of the restaurant groupies, will be amazed if this place is still open in 3 years..but then again, Panera makes it !",

    "text": "First of all, the staff here is SO nice. Second, they offer a number of gluten-free options (*not* just salads), and all their delicious sauces are gluten-free.  The first time I visited, as soon as I mentioned I wanted a gluten-free bun, the staff was quick to let me know what was and wasn't gluten-free on the menu, down to the seasoning on the sweet potato fries. The second time I visited, I found the staff just as knowledgeable and helpful.   The staff is very hospitable - they check on you without being obtrusive, and no request is too small or too silly. The second time I visited, my best friend from college had come down to see me after more than a decade of not seeing each other, and when the manager came over to check on us he asked if the music could possibly be turned down a bit. (Since we were early and the first ones there, it seemed louder than it would have otherwise.) The manager immediately turned it down and soon after, came out to check to see if the new volume was as my friend hoped. So nice!  Another thoughtful touch: the hand-washing sink near the back entrance.   The prices are a tad high for burgers and fries but not more than other local places, and their sauces are amazing, especially the honey mustard and apple cider sauces. (Try the toasted marshmallow sauce at least once!) And you can use your Ballantyne card to get a discount.  My one wish: if you have a gluten allergy and you also don't eat beef, there are no burger options for you. The turkey and veggie burgers are made with bread crumbs. During my second visit I ended up just getting a basket of sweet potato fries since I really don't eat beef, and the staff obviously felt terrible. They kept asking if there was anything else they could possibly get me. Again, so nice.",

    "text": "First, I must start out by saying that I am extremely critical of Burger spots.  It feels like there are a million burger joints and I really think you need to stand out to get a 4 or 5 star review.  Having said that, allow me to tell you about my two trips to Burger 21.  First trip --  If you have a Tex/Mex Burger with onion rings, bacon, and bbq sauce... I am going to order it.  Period.  The picture of the Tex/Mex in the gallery is spot on.  They do an excellent job with cooking it as ordered and using nice and fresh buns.  The bun is half the burger and crucial. Overall, I would give this Tex/Mex burger a 6.9 out of 10.  The 6.9 is overwhelmingly decided on due to comparison with other burgers.  The burger at Bad Daddys and Cowbell Uptown blow this out of the water.    I was rather disappointed with the fries.  Now this may be just because I generally like more of a steak cut type of fry (or at least some body to the fry) but B21's were shoe string and rather plain.  To their credit, they do have a sauce stations and you can load up on variety of flavors.  I would suggest the rajin cajun sauce.  It's good!    Although, I couldnt get myself to order one of the milkshakes or floats, they looked BANGIN!  I would imagine it would rather difficult to not enjoy one of those.    Second trip --  I got the Tex/Mex burger another go around.  Hahaha.  What can I say.. I like bacon and bbq on my burger.. Sue me!  Overall, same review.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that I will definitely go back but if they keep sending me a buy one get one free burger coupon.. I will probably venture that way again.    Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

It can be hard to find a spot near Burger 21 upon arrival, but I looped around a few times and was able to find a spot within a few minutes.  I was greeted by a vary friendly young lady at the register who helped me decide on what to order by going thru the menu with me.  I ended up ordering the Black and Bleu Burger with regular fries and a Coke.  There was plenty of seating and within a few minutes I had my food at the table.  The dipping sauce station was very cool.  I tried the Thai Ketchup and the Chipotle Mayo.  Both very good!!    My burger was cooked perfectly!!  The fries were very good as well.  The place is very nicely decorated and very clean.  Just an overall good experience and I will treat myself again every now and then.....  Happy Yelpin'.......",

Burger was medium well, much more medium rare, but that's so much better then all dried out. Fry's average at best. Never did taste any bacon. Sure not Five Guys, my standard,  at about the same price. Best thing was the different dipping sauces you can choose from. I just wasn't real impressed.",

    "text": "Burger 21 always does right by us! The owner that we met is awesome and the food & customer service is great! We've been here several times and love this establishment. It's always clean and they have a \"no touch required\" hand wash station behind the dining area that is very convenient.   The BBQ Bacon Burger is sooooo delicious! I've tried the Cinco de Mayo and Tex-Mex Haystack & wasn't a fan of them but the owner/manager on duty definitely made up for it (another reason we love this place). He personally came by to see how we were doing and offered to give us a new order (but we were a little full from the fries and what we had eaten of the burgers already) - so instead gave us vouchers to come back and order something else AND free cookies lol!  So yes, we love Burger 21. Next on the \"to try\" list are the milkshakes and some non-beef items. Oh and the basket of fries are always hot, fresh & delicious. There are a ton of sauces at the condiment bar. Definitely can't forget about alllll of the sauces, thai ketchup being a favorite! This place is a must try for a great burger day or night. Hopefully I'll be able to move this to five stars once I try some of their other menu items :)  #NoMoreFiveGuysAfterThisPlace",

    "text": "What a nice addition to our neighborhood eateries. Burger 21 is a short walk from our condo nestled in Ballantyne Village and just the place to visit for to get your burger fix. This is like an upscale fast food burger joint. Kind of an oxymoron but no better way to describe it. The menu is filled with gourmet burgers or you can craft your own. Also chicken, turkey, fish or veggie burgers are available. You can even order a salad, but the burgers are their main thing. You order at the counter and they deliver your food to the table.   We've stopped in several times before for a shake or snack before so this wasn't our first visit. We stopped in again on July 4th because 1. you have to have a burger 2. you must watch fireworks and 3. 'Merica.   We both ordered the BBQ burger - with bacon, onion straws and BBQ sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was beautiful. We also shared a basket of fries. Thin crispy fries reminiscent of the days when I used to frequent the ol' Golden Arches. Everyone loves fries. Seriously. What's not to love about these were the perfect fix for a McDonalds style fry without the shame if actually going to a McDonalds.  We've tried the multitudes of sauces. Some are just weird. Like toasted marshmallow. I get the idea behind it, but still, it's just weird.   We've stopped in several times for burgers, shakes, dine in and carry out, and each time the service is efficient, our orders are accurate and the facility is clean. These are things that make for an overall excellent visit.   Can't wait to visit again!",

Every month they have a special burger as well as shakes. I would recommend this if you want a good burger and fries.",

The guy was eager top tell is about his best sellers. My boyfriend got the tex mex and I ordered the bacon cheese burger. The guys also told me I could add and egg to any burger on the menu. So I did! We ordered fries with a side of the cheese ale sauce. We made great choices! Everything was amazing! The sauce bar is what makes this place stand out. They have close to 10 different sauces and you can try them all! One other key ticket for me was that they had local beer on tap. I picked up a JAM session from Noda Brewery.   All I can say is go here asap!!",

She enjoyed her creme brulee shake, saying the flavor was spot on and it was very sweet. Our burgers were brought out and they were cooked exactly how we wanted. I definitely liked the brioche bun. We both devoured our burger! I was at Smashburger a few weeks before and I will say I prefer this burger over theirs.  I wasn't so impressed with the fries, but whether it was habit or hunger or the fact that I hate to see fries wasted, we both ate every last one so how bad could they be? Lol!

If you don't like beef, no worries! They have seafood, chicken, etc. I personally loved the ahi tuna burger but if you're someone who loves to Instagram their food- the burger itself didn't look very appealing.   Some other pros: 1. Sauce bar! They have so many unique sauces. They even have a toasted marshmallow one but I'm pretty sure someone told me it's for the sweet potato fries. 2. They have milk shakes here! Love the concept of the place.  3. Food comes fast.  4. Check your mail for coupons! Sometimes I get BOGO and it's definitely worth it.  Cons: 1. Burger doesn't come with fries...that always bums me out.  That's about it! I'll be back soon.",

    "text": "Burger 21 is one of the relatively recent burger chains that has popped up.  I knew it had been here for a while but only recently tried it one day when Extreme Pita was permanently closed.    My first two visits were very good.  I got my orders two go.  Whether you dine in or out, you place your order at the counter and they will bring it to you.  The people working are always friendly and very accommodating which does need seem to be the norm these days.  My orders were accurate and the burgers and salad were good.  The burgers were cooked medium well as requested.  The fries leave a lot to be desired.  They are previously frozen and always have way too much salt added to them.  Thankfully they have a sauce bar with twelve sauces to drown out the salt.    On my last visit I again got my order to go.  I ordered the burger of the month which was a burger with fried egg and bacon.  It was quite messy which I initially thought was from the egg.  There was so much going on in the burger though the the toppings hid the rareness of the burger.  It was almost entirely pink except for the outside.  My stomach hurt so bad that night that I hardly slept. I did not return the burger because I just live too far from the place.  I did fill out the survey though to let them know about it.  This was the only issue out of three experiences so I'll go back.  I will just make sure my burger is cooked next time.",

It seems like they have a good selection of burgers and change them how you like. I LOVE the in house sauces, the Ragin Cajun sauce... I could put it on everything! I also really like the Thai Ketchup.    I sadly found my burger disappointing, it seemed frozen compared to all the in house black bean patties I have had. That's not cool when they are serving all natural and organic etc. meat patties. Its not too hard to make black bean patties, very easy and super cheap. My boyfriend's burger was a lot better than mine, I guess I have to get the chicken here from now on. The fries were tasty but a little pricey for $3 for a small.   I'll be back to try out the chicken burgers and stock up on that Ragin' Cajun.",

The variety in sauces they offer are stored at right way and at right temperature avoiding bacterias etc. Burger 21 provides small containers so you can pick the sauce you want in the quantity you want.

We walked up to order, got 2 burgers (Mediterranean toppings on a beer burger and Tex-Mex Haystack), fries, ale cheese dip and an espresso shake (which comes with chocolate covered espresso beans). The woman checking us out was very friendly, attentive and helpful. After ordering we picked out a few sauces (including marshmallow, which was actually delicious with fries) and picked our table. We only waited a few minutes for our delicious food. The burgers were cooked exactly as requested. Buns were delicious as well. Throughout eating our waters were refilled multiple times. I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food and excellent service for a good price. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I've been to Burger 21 twice now for dinner in the past week.  I guess it's safe to say that I love it.  Five Guys?  Meh.  Give Burger 21 a try.  When you first walk in, you grab a paper menu and study it intensely.  There are so many choices that I think they need a better system so the doorway doesn't get clogged, but maybe that's just me because everything sounds so good that it's hard to narrow my selection down to just one.  You order and pay at the counter.  Now, here's the part I don't really like:  on your charge slip you're given to sign, there's an OBVIOUS place there for gratuity.  I can either (a) leave a tip at a \"fast food\" restaurant in advance, hoping I get what I paid for or (b) not leave a tip and look like a total dork and run the risk of my food being tainted.  Can I just say how much I hate the expectation of a tip at anything other than a full-service restaurant?  If you're making more than $2/hour like a server does, then you're already getting paid to do your job!!!    Okay, I'll get off my soapbox about that ridiculousness and, yes, I have left gratuity both times in advance I've dined there this week, most likely so I didn't look like a big d-bag at the counter.    The decor inside is fresh and modern.  The outside patio offers a lot of seating to enjoy the nice summer weather (there's even an awning over it in case of rain/heat/what-have-you).   While you're waiting for someone to bring out your food to you, you can stock up on a variety of dips from their condiment bar.  They have so many unique offerings.  By far, my favorite is the Ragin' Cajun to dip my french fries in, although I have trouble distinguishing between the Ragin Cajun and the Chipotle Mayo.   I'm not a big fan of ketchup, but I tried the Thai Ketchup, hoping it would be something special and tangy that didn't resemble ketchup.  Nope.  It tasted like regular ketchup to me.  I thought the Apple Cider was going to be a vinegar for my fries, but it ended up being a creamy dip.  It was good, but tasted almost like Honey Mustard to me.    The first night we dined there, I tried the Mediterranean Chicken Burger.  It was really tasty, but probably could have used more of everything on top, especially feta cheese and grilled red peppers.  We shared a big basket of \"Cheese & Ale Fries topped with bacon & scallions.\"  It's really a basket of fries (plenty to share) with a cup of hot soupy beer cheese with bacon and scallions mixed in.   It was good, but after discovering the condiment bar with its multitude of free sauces, you don't really need the cheese.  Maybe if it was melted over a mound of fries it would make more sense.    The second night this week we visited, I opted for a regular beef burger, and went with the Philly Cheese burger.  Wow--GOOD CHOICE.  It was cooked to my liking, very juicy, and the beef was extremely flavorful and well-seasoned.  Combine that with the gooey cheese and pepper and onions, and I was more than satisfied.  It was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.    Obviously, I'm going back.  The only question is...when?",

For me, it's always a challenge to find a veggie burger that is more than a Morningstar Farms patty that's overcooked.  Search no further. Burger 21's Black Bean Burger is a game changer. I ordered mine sans red onion and substituted their utterly perfect brioche for the whole wheat bun that comes standard.   I devoured every morsel happily. So, so good. I'll easily recommend this place to meat and veggie lovers alike.  They also have banging fries, of  both the regular and sweet potato variety. And a plethora of dipping sauces ranging from toasted marshmallow (you either love it or hate it) to thai ketchup.  The burgers are thick and juicy, and there is no end to the number of combinations you can try. The Mr recently ordered the tuna burger, while friends went with The Skinny (turkey burger).   I think this chain is doing things right, and I have no doubt that Burger21 will be successful in this new Ballantyne location.",

What a thoughtful recommendation, yes please!  I got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger which seems almost identical to what Red Robin calls their Whisky River BBQ bacon burger.  No matter, I didn't want unlimited fries anyway.  I asked my ole lady what she thought after our meal and she commented she couldn't recall having a better burger recently.   I will be back.  YUM.

I got the Texas burger which comes with a multitude of premium toppings like avocado, deep fried onion strings and gouda cheese.  I knew I was about to become a fan when the guy said I could have it cooked rare if I wanted. I opted for med rare and it came out perfectly cooked. We got a pound of sweet potato fries to share.  A perfect accompaniment to the fries was a huge sauce counter with a dozen or so choices including some bizarre ones like toasted marshmallow and apple cider. I enjoyed the Chipotle mayo, Thai ketchup, and ragin' cajun. The apple was surprisingly good as well. Fries themselves were thinner than I prefer but decent enough. As for the burger,  outstanding! Easily the best I've had from a casual joint and rivaled the best from a high end restaurant. It's worth the 8 dollar price tag, but when you add $3 for 1 order of sweet potato fries and $2.19 for a drink, you're talking $14 per person with tax.  Another downside  is they don't have any grilled chicken sandwiches on the menu, which is basically all my mom orders at these places. They also have veggie, ground chicken and turkey patties if red meat isn't your thing. I tried a bite of my brother's chicken parm burger which was quite yummy.  But ground beef is the way to go if you ask me.  Other than the price and somewhat limited options,  I can't really complain about anything. Will definitely make it back when I return to Charlotte.",

The burger was juicy.. even with transit (but not soggy).

I didn't get a chance to try anything too fancy or \"artisan\" if you will.. that night I was just in the mood for a classic cheeseburger with carmelized onions done right, and they delivered.

I thought it would be whole shrimp sort of like a shrimp po'boy.  Instead, it's ground shrimp in a patty form...with a lot of spice!  Quite interesting.  Be sure to brace yourself for the heat if you get it.  Burger 21 also has awesome shakes.  But you could get on serious calorie overload if you get a burger, fries, and shake.  But what the heck, right?  Overall, I like Burger 21.  Keep it on your short list for a more refined, \"faster food\", burger.",

Not a huge beer selection but a couple of decent local brews. Kind of a fast food setting, you order at the counter and they bring it out to you. If you want a second beer you have to get back in line. Again, not a gourmet burger but pretty darn good.",

    "text": "Let me just tell you.....not many places get Five stars from me....but this is a rare exception!  At first I thought, great ANOTHER burger place (since that is all the rage right now).  Boy, didn't take long to figure out this was no ordinary burger joint.  The location is awesome of course being at the village.  The interior is bright, modern, clean, and cheery.  There is also a huge covered patio outside that is really fun.  The staff is amazing.  High-end restaurant service at a burger place.....unheard of!  They are all friendly, fun, energetic, and really helpful!  They suggest things for you, answer questions, come by the table several times while you are eating, etc.  A manager usually comes by at least once, and is always super friendly.  When you walk in, you mosey up to the counter where you are warmly welcomed.  They have menus all over the place, and eagerly await your questions (which there always are).  The have tons of burgers, and they even have \"real\" chicken burgers...not just a breast or a ground up mess, but a unique textured patty that is lightly browned on the outside, and juicy on the inside.  There yummy sides...but the best are the skinny crunchy sweet potato fries!  Did I mention they have a hand-crafted milkshake bar???  OMG is all I can say about that!!!  After that, you pick a great table or booth, then you get to browse the dipping sauce bar!  That's right, a row of awesome dipping sauces like toasted marshmellow or thai ketchup.  They are incredible!  Finally, a fresh and friendly take on a greasy burger joint....simply put, delicious.  One of my favorite places in Ballantyne now...I am addicted and go pretty much once a week!!  Everyone enjoy, and to the employees, managers, and owners...BRAVO!",

    "text": "In Charlotte you basically have limited choices for awesome burgers.  If you follow my reviews you know my thoughts on Bad Daddy's (Yuck) and there's Five Guys.    BURGER 21 lays the smackdown on all of them.  Hands down heavy weight champion of the world type smackdown.  We showed up right when they opened on Sunday morning and were immediately impressed with all of the choices.  I orders the Tex Mex Haystack on the recommendation of the nice young lady behind the counter. Applewood-smoked bacon, Gouda, guacamole, onion strings, chipotle-jalapeno sauce, toasted brioche bun...who the heck puts Gouda on a burger?  THIS GUY from now on it was just yummy.  Another thing to point out is that the \"Bun : Burger : Topping\" ration was simply perfect.  The burger didn't over power or over juice the bun where it fell apart and you had to relinquish a man card by eating it with a fork.  They also allow you to choose the way you want the burger cooked so I chose Med Rare the way a burger should be.  They also have a multitude of sauces including the Thai Ketchup with was awesome with fries.  I'm glad I found you Burger 21 and will be back.  I do realize that location has been cursed for quite some time but hopefully the sheeple that are eating terrible burger across the street smarten up and check you out.",

It was topped with bleu cheese, bacon, fresh lettuce & some kind of delicious sauce.  My husband loved his burger, too! And the milkshake was simply amazing - it was the perfect consistency & flavor.  The fries were delicious as well.    The staff is all so friendly and helpful.  They have a ton of really good burger combos/choices on the menu or you can build your own if you don't like their combos.

Take the extra time to make an awesome fry! - Condiments are plentiful, but none are fresh or homemade. Again, the devil is in the details.

I think hat you always need to have a little of both in order to use all of their sauces that are delicious. The Thai ketchup is great with the fries and burgers, but I personally love the apple cider sauce and marshmallow sauce for fries.  The burgers are always very moist and I love to order their salads with a blackened burger to top it off. Don't forget to order one of their milkshakes.

    "text": "I'd been wanting to try out Burger 21 for years. Finally I made it in when I signed up for their rewards club and received a coupon for free fries. I placed my order online. I loved that their online system allowed you to select how much of an item you wanted with each item. For example you can select EXTRA lettuce & LITE cheese. I also enjoyed that you could choose to pay cash in the restaurant and not online, which allowed me to use my coupon. I placed my order and it told me about how long it'd take to fulfill which was 15 minutes. I arrived and went to the area with the big sign for Take Out Orders. I presented my coupon and they applied the discount. Pretty quick and seamless process. But once I paid, they handed me my receipt with no direction. So I just kind of stood there wondering where my food was. I didn't see a kitchen so I was confused. I walked around the corner to see if I was supposed to go to another counter but there were just restrooms there. So I found a tablet and sat down until about 5 minutes later my order came out.   The burger was seasoned nicely. It had a lot of flavor so I enjoyed it for the most part. But the extra lettuce that I asked for must've disappeared or melted away. I'd consider what i received a typical amount, not extra. And it was soggy under the burger. Then the cheese wasn't that great either. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries with the Apple Cider sauce. I was excited that they had sauce options for them unlike other places that only serve typical condiments with them. I thought the Marshmallow sauce was too sweet but I could see how it would be a good option for others. For the most part I enjoyed my meal, though it's not a place i'd \"crave\". It didn't leave a lasting impression.  After I wrote this review, I received a call from the Manager, explaining the ordering process and apologizing for my experience. I really appreciated this and it showed that they really value their customers opinions and take it serious. She stated she'd be making sure everyone explains the wait for fresh cooked fries to customers. So I bumped this review from 3 stars to 4. I'll be giving them another try!",

So not knowing what to get and leaning on someone behind me suggesting the sliders an audible was called at the counter and one that was converted to a touchdown at that. The lady at the counter suggested to try the Bayou Burger because we like spicy. This was the featured burger at the the time and feel like it came straight out of Louisiana.  Comes with andouille sausage and on a turkey burger (yes I like I this turkey burger) , blackened grilled shrimp, remoulade , sirachi, and I even liked the Cajun Coke slaw . All comes on a brioche bun.  So good and did I mention that 5 out of 6 got this burger and all happy about the choice .    So they also have a sauces bar with many different sauces that I recommend.  Get the Cajun one for your fries.  Also if you order fries you may opt for the cheese dip on the side which is ok but a little runny .  All in all a great experience",

They have a very full menu full of burger offerings, which made it very hard for me to decide. Always a favorite at other burger joints, I decided on the black & bleu burger - with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, tomato & onion. You are able to choose how you want your burger cooked. I chose medium well. And of course, I had to have fries. We chose our sauces at the \"sauce bar\" - there was favored mayos & other dipping/topping sauces to choose from.  While we waited, I went to the restroom - very clean AND they have the Dyson airblade drying system! I LOOOOVE Dyson products, so I was so excited to see this in the restroom.   After I came back out, only a few minutes later our food arrived. Presentation was neat (check my picture). Burger & fries were cooked to perfection & they were oh so tasty. I had a fountain drink of Barg's Root Beer & it was deliciously refreshing.   Prices are pretty steep, but the burger was pretty big & the fries were a plenty.  Parking can be an issue, since they share space with many other businesses & restaurants.   I'm pleased & so was my belly!",

My go to burger includes bacon and avocado. Their milkshakes are delicious! They rotate flavors so there is always a different one along with the usuals to choose from.",

I got more than 3 words review from my hubs who said it was a nice combination and the burgers were juicy. If i get more than it's good I'm happy.  My 10 year old enjoyed feeding us fry sauce combinations and devouring her burger which was messy but delicious! definitely a good break from cooking dinner without sinking to regular fast food fare.  Have to Add on the way out when kiddo wanted to take her shake but we needed a flat lid the staff was awesome about changing the cups out and getting us one with a lid. So helpful.",

I had the shrimp burger which was medium on flavor but very much edible and appreciated. It's not often that I go to enjoy lunch or even dinner for that matter out with my family at a place like this on the go because burger spots don't have enough variety for the non burger consumer.  My husband had the burger special since it was a feature burger. It was a turkey burger with a layer of grilled shrimp and some amazing avocado sauce. He enjoyed his burger very much. We ordered fries to split, they were sweet potato fries which we were very impressed with. The sweet potato fries were the highlight item for us as they were perfectly crispy. Many times you get sweet potato fries that are soft and lack crisp and flavor. These were perfect ;-) The cost was a bit much for the one order if fries as well as the burgers. I'm sure we will be back, we will try w shake next time.",

You walk in and pick up a menu and order at the counter.  They give you a number and bring your order to the table.  I ordered the Tex-Mex Haystack burger with the jalepeno sauce on the side.  We had a shareable size sweet potato fry.  You can pick all the sauces you want at the sauce bar which is a huge deal for me as I'm a self proclaimed sauceaholic.  I picked up some honey mustard and chipotle mayo.  Only complaint - Our sweet potato fries came out about 5 minutes ahead of our burger.  I do wish they would have come out at the same time so they stayed warmer longer.  The sweet potato fries were great.  Perfectly saucy, thin, and crispy.  I love dipping my sweet potato fries in honey mustard.  The burger I ordered was phenomenal! One of my favorite burgers ever.  I did not eat the jalepeno sauce with it - it was a little spicy for my taste but the chipotle mayo was really great on it. We will make this a frequent place we visit from now on!",

Unfortunately, I am limited in what I can recommend as I never make it past the first item on the menu, the Burger 101, which is their standard burger all the way. Be prepared to use plenty of napkins as these juicy angus burgers will require lots of them. They realize too that the bun matters, for a great burger on a mediocre bun ruins the entire product. Theirs is a simple and delicious toasted brioche bun.  Regular and sweet potato fries are also delicious and are available in three sizes. Their sauce bar is  even worth noting and includes mayos available in more than a dozen flavors from self-serve pumps beside the fountain drink refill station. Mayo flavors include Ragin Cajun and Chipotle. Service is attentive and friendly. Open and airy dining areas available in and out.  We love the handwashing station in the eating area, which is a real testimony to their impeccable sanitary rating. Not sure if I'll ever make it to them but their menu is loaded with other choices other than burgers, including delicious looking chicken and turkey sandwiches. In its category, this joint is, again, a Gotta Try!",

Additionally, when you add the friendliness of the staff and those hand made milk shakes.......oh my what a winning combination.",

    "text": "Honestly, I was very impressed with this place. Sure, it's a burger joint, but they also have something for everyone, even the non-burger lovers. From sliders to massive, melty cheeseburgers, everything coming out of the kitchen looked great.   I ended up trying to be a little healthier on my trip (had enough red meat for a week) and opted for the buffalo chicken salad, and this salad was epic. First, the size alone was massive, but it wasn't just all lettuce. It was a even mixture of toppings, from buffalo chicken to avocados, they certainly didn't skimp. The boys I went with both got different sliders, and three was more than enough for them. They also got kids milkshakes, which were decadent in and of themselves. If your thinking of getting one, go for it!   Although I didn't get any fries, they have multiple dipping options, ranging well outside the normal ketchup/mustard range.",

I decided on the Greek veggie burger (I'm not a big beef eater). Burger doesn't come with fries or a drink. I decided on the sweet potato fries and the cashier said most of their sauces are homemade and the toasted marshmallow sauce goes great with the sweet potato fries. And yes, it was delicious!!! Like so so good.  Burger was good. I thought the bun it's self was too thick and definitely more bread than burger when I took a bite. But the veggies were fresh and cut a little thicker. A friend at the table had a shake and it looked yummy, so I'll have to stop back for one!",

The cheese steak was a little bit salty and the cheesy bacon was OK. Not really something to rave about but they were decent burgers. I like the sweet potato fries but the french fries tasted like they were fried on a-million-times used oil. Now here's the punch. After eating our tummy became bloated. And then the nightmare began. I got diarrhea and was up all night going back and forth to the bathroom. My partner who had the cheese steak was throwing up. That burger made us sick and I'm sure it's something from the meat. So no more Burger 21 for me and maybe for you, too. Think twice.",

I ordered a burger and a beer, my wife ordered the chicken tender basket  We were told to take a seat and they would bring our food out to us in ~8 minutes.  We stocked up on sauces and sat down, unfortunately I finished my beer in 15 minutes, but still didn't have our food.  So we people watched, and watched the people coming in after us get served when we did.  The burger was bland and boring, just skillet cooked and not very good beef.  The side order of sweet potato fries I got were shoestring thin and wonderful though.  My wife liked her chicken tenders, which might have been the reason for the delay, but the extremely large order of regular fries that came with her tenders were plain jane.  The Sauces bar was a disappointment - the marshmallow dip was gross but worth a try, but didn't really go with anything.  The tai ketchup was the best, but was not spicy enough.  The BBQ sauce tasted like cheap kraft BBQ sauce.  Just a letdown really, I am not a big fan of five guys, but I would have rather brought a five guys burger and eaten it there.",

    "text": "Another burger place in the Ballantine area... Great!  Unfortunately there is limited street parking in front of the building, so be prepared for a walk from the nearby parking deck during busy times of the day.   Walking into Burger21 you are greeted by a PPP predominantly white & open space that is somewhat on the small side. Everything is clean, but the lack of color makes things look a bit hospital-like.   Everything is ordered a LA carte. Choose from 19 different Angus beef burgers, two seafood, four chicken or two vegetarian option. This is a fast-casual design, so you order at the counter, get a number, and the food is brought out to you. The lack of a large wall mounted menu means you are scrambling for the paper menus.   The burgers themselves are nice and juicy, but I found them to be lacking in flavor. Some additional seasoning would really help with the flavor.   The fries on the other hand were excellent. Thinly sliced and nice and crispy. These were some of the best fries I have had in a long time.  Burger21 also has a large selection of different types of ketchup, so you can flavor tour fries to your liking.   Prices were in line with what you would pay at a full service sit down restaurant (at least as far as lunch prices are concerned).   Overall Burger 21 is not a bad option, but it is nothing special either. There are better options for burgers in this area.",

The burgers are roughly a half pound, the applewood-smoked bacon is cooked just right, and the BBQ sauce is sweet. The fries and onion strings are not really seasoned but there is a sauce bar with a wide range of selections to make them tastier. There is currently a special shake: the kitchen sink. Highly recommend it as it tastes like every candy bar you want to have in your pantry was put in the blender. If it's just you and one other person, consider sharing a large side as it's enough to enjoy but too much to fill up on and miss out on the shakes, floats, sundaes! Seating can be tricky on colder days as there are a few tables and booths inside and they are placed close together for maximum possible occupancy. There is a sizable outdoor patio for outdoor seating. We will definitely be returning to this place for burgers, fries, and shakes.",

Now on to the reason for visiting this establishment... FOOD: Very underwhelmed.  If they are competing with Wendy's, Burger King, and such they win on most counts except price of course. But if their True competition is Red Robin, Bad Daddy's even Five Guys they lose on all counts.  I ordered the Bacon Cheesy and found the dominate taste was bun. Burger was very undersized for the bun. Bun was so coated on the top I had to put a napkin over the bun prior to cutting the sandwich in half. Tasted no cheese... little bacon. I accepted all standard accompaniments offered, i.e. mustard, catsup, mayo... it they were present they were the blandest versions of these products I've ever tasted...or not. Ordered the large fries which comes in the small size cup. Mostly full of 3/4 to 1\" size fries. Not the best for catsup dipping unless you require your fingers to be a part of each bite. Bottom line... way overpriced...far too many much better places to dine in the same neighborhood. Thank God I had the coupon!",

All the staff was very friendly, they made a point to make it feel like a normal sit-down restaurant despite the fact that you order your food at a counter. They bring you and pick up your food when you're done. They have a large menu, including several burgers, chicken sandwiches, turkey and veggie burgers, sweet potato, regular, and cheese fries. For a healthier option, they have a few salads. However, it gets a little pricey when ordering because fries are not included in a combo price. They also have many delicious milkshakes that add to your overall bill. A sauce bar adds some uniqueness to burger 21- they have around 10 different sauces you can dip your fries in or add to your burger. Overall, I enjoyed Burger 21, but I wouldn't be able to eat there very often considering it is pretty unhealthy. I mean, how can you go to a burger place and not indulge in a burger, fries, AND a shake?",

Immediately in looking at the menu I noticed right away that they were priced lower (for the most part) compared to its nearby competitors. I feel they have a variety of burgers to choose from so one can definitely find something. If you can't, there is no \"build your burger\" option but I am sure they can substitute if needed (most places can). I ordered the 'shroom and my husband ordered the black & bleu. I ordered mine medium because I noticed that medium here is closer to medium rare, and indeed it was, which is how I prefer it. The burgers aren't overly big 6.2 oz before cooking so I don't feel as guilty about eating it. We both enjoyed them. The sauce bar is also unique, but the marshmallow one  was very sweet and I am unsure why you would add that to a burger, but then again I am more of a traditionalist.

Ordering was a breeze. We got our number at sat at a booth.   We got the fries to share. The fries are skinny and they were hot at crispy. The only thing I didn't like was that it had way too much salt for my liking so next time I might ask to not add so much salt. My friend got the black bean burger and she really liked it. I got the monterey chicken. The flavor was good and the chicken wasn't dry. The avocado and pico added a nice touch to it. The only thing I noticed was that everything was warm except for the bread. It was cold. It was good other wise.   Overall, this place is good and has a lot to offer. I do like they have a sauce station as well!",

The burger was small and was just decent. May eat here again in the future but it wouldn't be my first choice for a burger joint.",

I met some friends here for lunch and we had a pleasant experience. There is seating inside and outside on their canvased patio.  I opted for the \"Gruyere burger\" and asked for it at medium. It didn't take nearly as long as the ten minutes I was promised, which left enough time to get a couple of different dipping sauces (thai ketchup! honey mustard!) and my drink from the fountain of coke products.  Burger was excellent. Very messy due to the fried egg on top that burst on the first bite. Grilled onions, tomato, bacon, and thin asparagus on a brioche bun. Tasty stuff, here.

They donate 10% of the day's proceeds to a local charity or school on the 21st of each month!   Located apart of a shopping center and right next to Moe's. Today was a perfect day to sit outside and they had outdoor seating. Not so great when it is super windy though, because the wind will lift your skirts, snatch your babies, and more importantly steal your napkins.   The environment was nice, clean, and they had free wifi. Staff was very friendly as well.   The featured special is a #21 Korean BBQ burger that has bulgogi, kimchi, fresh herbs, salad, Korean Ninja sauce (gochujang), and its packed with a bit of fiyyyaahhh. Their menu consists of 11 beef burgers, 4 chicken burgers, 2 turkey burgers, 2 seafood burgers, and 2 veggie burgers. They also have chicken tenders for your picky children or grilled cheese, gourmet hotdogs, and sliders for the indecisive peeps. French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, beef Chillis, salads, shakes, and cookies and sundaes.   The sauce bar includes 8-10 different sauces like Thai ketchup, Ranch, ketchup, BBQ, Raging Cajun... They have a few toppings as add-ons like Chilli, fried egg, avocado... I wish they had bacon jam. yummm bacon jam.. fruity fatness in a jam.   I ordered the chicken parm sandwich. It was not as messy as most burgers and tasted better than expected. The cheese was perfectly gooey and you could taste the fresh tomatoes in the sauce. I would recommend this burger and can't wait to be back to try the others.   The Fries were delicious. I asked for extra crispy and they came out perfectly golden with a great crunch! They were long and perfect for trying out the different sauces. If you wanted to get real naaaaasty, you can mix them and try them all together.",

Speaking of which, they have about 8 different condiments, including ketchup, mustard and honey mustard to add to your burger or use on the fries.

The sauce choices are all great with my favorites being Thai ketchup, Raging Cajun, Toasted Marshmallow and Ranch (a condiment staple and this is a \"good\" ranch not one of those stale kind of ranches).   On this visit I got the Buffalo chicken burger no tomato sub red onion and half and half fries. My mom got the burger 101 and my niece kids cheeseburger. My burger was delicious. The ranch dressing, blue cheese crumbles and Frank's red hot sauce was a great addition to the buffalo chicken burger. I could only eat half the burger after eating the fries.   They delivered our fries out before our burgers (the burgers were still cooking) and I really appreciated that. We were starving plus that allowed us time to eat the fries while they were good and hot and then enjoy the burgers will they were hot.   All of the employees were very helpful and polite. The atmosphere was nice and the place stayed packed with customers.   Burger 21  14825 Ballantyne Village Way Ste 160 Charlotte, NC 28277 Friday January 12, 2018 1:30pm",

The low rating comes from the bathroom looking like a bathroom at a dive bar (and, as is well known, the cleanliness of the bathroom is the best indicator of the cleanliness of the kitchen) and the fact that the quality and portion of the food is not proportional to the price they charge. All in all, not bad but it's unlikely I would return.",

Now here is where it gets gross.  When I wiped down the table with an alcohol wipe, my wipe turned black.  That has to be months of buildup because you don't just have complete filth everywhere from one day.  Not coming back until they clean up the restaurant.",

Never eaten in, but it seems like a cute litte place to grab some quick food. Oh, and they always have a smile on their face, great service.",

I looked on their menu and was really impressed with their options, they have 2 vegetarian options, and a couple seafood and turkey burgers besides their beef options.  I chose the black bean burger, which had salsa, avocado, aoili, lettuce, and tomato on a whole wheat bun (it also comes with sourcream, but I didn't want that).  It was what you would call an upscale stacked burger, delicious!  The price was steep for a burger.. with tax it came to about $7 and some cents, I thought it would have came with fries, but you have to pay extra for those.  I wanted fries but they were an extra $3, so I declined.  I ate part of it while it was hot and the other half after work when it was cold, and the burger was excellent both hot/warm and cold.  Next for the milkshake I selected the seasonal Pumpkin or Pumpkin Pie milkshake, it was good also, but didn't taste much like pumpkin.. it tasted more like eggnog.. but it was good nonetheless.    The staff was friendly.  The food was good.  I would go back, especially if I had another coupon.",

We had not heard of Burger 21, but decided let's give it a go because we are a little mad with another burger joint and their recent changes.  I was excited to try some of their burgers as they had quite a few different options and what looked like fun burgers.  I tried the Philly Burger and Kevin had some mexican burger, can't recall the name, but it had salsa, guac, etc. on it.  The burgers came out a little on the cold side, and they lacked flavor.  They are nice thick burger, but they were too greasy and dripped way too much for my liking.  I'm glad we had a coupon as they are on the pricier side compared to other burger joints.  Probably will not return.",

And mostly, they've been disappointing.  Until now...  Burger21 is less than 1/4 of a mile from where I work, so I decided to hop in and check it out one day for lunch.  My expectations were fairly low (based on past experiences), but the results totally blew me out of the water!  The meat on the burger was thick, juicy, and full of flavor.  There are a variety of burgers available (along with the required \"build your own\") to cater to all tastes!  And if you want to take your burger creation just a little bit further, a sauce/topping bar with a number of available sauces is available for your perusal.    Price-wise?  A little bit on the high side, but I don't mind paying for good quality.    Atmosphere?  Very clean, with a variety of tables and high-tops.  Bar seating (at the milkshake making station) is also available.  The one thing that didn't really impress me?  The fries.  Meh... take 'em or leave 'em.  But that burger will be bringing me back again and again!",

We'll be back - but probably on a week night.",

First thing I asked was do you dry or grill your burgers, the guy says \"grilled of corse\" We place our order, 2 burgers with cheese, fries and two drinks...$26.00! The guy says you want the medium well right, I said no hockey puck for me, medium please.  The medium well thing is suggested to everyone behind me I'm a bit amazed.  Food comes out, small portions, especially for $26.00, I look at the burger, the fried not grilled burger, greasy as all get out (which is expected with a fried burger, this is why I asked), now I get it why they recommend med well, it's a real chore to cook a burger on the flat top and get it anything but med well.  Although a bit tasty, im really disappointed they lie, I mean if you going to serve McDonalds style burgers own up to it.  For the money I could have had 4 times the food and at much better quality from cookout.  2 stars because the place was clean and the girl who brought the food out was very nice.",

As with all of their burgers, take on plenty of napkins as juicy is a well used adjective at Burger 21.  Service is a trust issue as you are given a number to put on your table stand in the hopes that a server with what you ordered will appear with your meal.  It is an \"L\" shaped dining area so not all tables are in sight of the main counter.  But it works and I watched the server casually and routinely fetch napkins, hot sauce and other things for a customer with a cane.  Nice to see.  They also have a child size shake.  I appreciate it as I like shakes, esp malts, but hate to wolf down all the calories of a regular size portion.  The kid size is excellent, giving you the flavor and experience without the potential weight gain.  Parking can be a problem as once the interior parking places are taken you are relegated to the back 40 two story parking garage.  A good walk for the elderly or handicapped, so if you have any such in your party, drop them at the door, at the annoyance of the backed up potential parkers, so they can get in without the hump from the garage.",

Unique and decent variety of menu items, of which the stars are the burgers (obviously) and even pays homage to some old school joints of olde.   You're bound to land on a burger that you'll like under this roof. My favorite is definitely the Tuna Burger. Though, anything with rare tuna is going to be a hit with me. I will note that the TexMex Stack Burger was good, but lacked structure. The burger artist who assembled my most recent mess decided to put the lettuce and tomato on the bottom. Not sure if that's the Burger21 doctrine, but it made for some slippery handling. Not a fan.   Biggest aspect to approach for you first-timers? The sauce bar. Do yourself a favor and order the good ol' NC favorite -- sweet potato fries, and try out the Toasted Marshmallow sauce. Yep. You read that correctly.   Others of note are the Thai Ketchup and Chipotle Mayo. Both a nice touch.   Prices are decent, though you'll probably pay a little bit more for a full meal.   Have to say it's a big positive for Ballantyne Village. This place will do just fine in the 28277.",

I have extremely sensitive celiac disease and can never eat out when I'm in my hometown, as no restaurants there understand how to cook for and serve someone with celiac disease. I always get sick. While in Charlotte visiting family, we went to Burger 21 and I decided to give it a try since it had great reviews on the Find Me Gluten Free app. I'm so happy I did! They have a gluten free menu so you don't have to wonder at all what's safe. The people working there seemed very cautious with my order as well. They have a completely separate preparation area and fryer for gluten free orders. The burger I had was delicious, and so were the fries. Not a single hint of a reaction, either! My family also loved their meals. I definitely wish we had one of these in Houston.",

Had the bleu cheese burger & the bacon cheesey buger and they were well worth the calories and the $8.  The French fries are thin like mcdonalds which just happen to be my favorite kind.  The sauce bar is so good, the apple cider sauce with the salty fries is a match made in heaven.  What really impressed me was that we saw the manager making sure all was clean, little things like that go a long way, especially at a chain.    The 4 out of 5 is because my husband had a bowl of chili which he said had no flavor at all.  Regardless of that fact I will be back for a burger next time I come across another of these.",

    "text": "Burger 21's mission statement is to deliver chef-created taste without the chef price and according to the guys at the Charlotte Burger Blog the burgers are \"Excellent\". The menu is comprised of 21 chef created Certified Angus burgers and the vegetarian, chicken, seafood and turkey burgers are all hormone free. Burger 21 has a gluten-free menu featuring gluten-free Angus beef burgers on French Meadow Bakery gluten-free buns, along with gluten-free shakes, salads and fries. Most of the burgers come equipped with a toasted brioche bun and for the most part sound pretty delicious.  With all of great menu items and rave reviews you might be surprised (or maybe not) that I gave them a fail rating... but I did.  We checked out the Cheese & Ale Fries topped with bacon & scallions but thought they were nothing more than McDonalds fries with a side of cheap cheese sauce and .25 ounce of chewy bacon chunks. The Bacon Cheesy came with lettuce, tomato, red onion, applewood-smoked bacon, and our choice of American, Cheddar or Swiss cheese, on a toasted brioche bun. Besides the delicious brioche bun the Bacon Cheesy is your average uninspiring bacon cheeseburger with no more personality than any of its predecessors.   The Philly Cheese came with grilled peppers and onions, provolone and white American cheese, a dijon chive mayo on a toasted brioche bun. All of that sounded amazing... but it wasn't. Instead it was overwhelmingly greasy, messy, and all together a waste of time. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Milk Shake was too Chocolatey for me and too Peanut Buttery for Ella, so I guess you could say it has the perfect balance.  I find way too many fancy dishes with a lack of personality being dressed up with truffles or truffle oil and at Burger 21 I felt like that was the role of the toasted brioche bun. The meat had no density, the Angus Beef burgers were uninspiring and without the brioche bun nothing worth writing about. If you're in the Ballantyne area go to Five Guys, if you're on Park Rd go to NomNom, and if you really want to try a chef inspired burger that will make your eyes roll to the back of your head... go to Toast Cafe.",

    "text": "Burgers in Ballantyne.  It's not an original concept - you don't have to look very far in Ballantyne to find place for a burger and a shake.    But what's different about Burger 21 - located in Ballantyne Village - is that, not only do you get a wide variety of patties to choose from, you can also choose from a wide variety of sauces to with your meal.  Patties range from beef to turkey to black bean to tuna to shrimp!  The sauces ranged from a Thai ketchup (yum) to toasted marshmallow (interesting).   My hubby and I decided on Burger 21 for a late Sunday lunch. When we arrived, we were greeted immediately and the cashier offered to walk us through the burgers and the point out the sauce bar.    We decided on the Half & Half basket of fries (potato and sweet potato), so in my carb-loving guilt, I ordered a salad - the Black & Blue Wedge.  I thought it might have been a mistake on my part but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a HUGE wedge covered in blue cheese, dressing and bacon - topped off with 3 beef slider patties.  I found it very good. The patties did get cold quicker than I would've liked, but it was on top of an iceberg (lettuce, that is).    Back to the fries, we definitely had some fun with the fry/sauce combos. My favorites were the sweet potato fries with the apple cider sauce and the potato with the Thai ketchup. YUM.   We both said we'd definitely be back - maybe to try something else. They do have chicken tenders --- Can you imagine how much fun chicken tenders and all those dipping sauces would be?",

Our burgers were delivered in fairly short order, but after we went back to the counter to order ice cream, it took nearly 30 MINUTES for three sundaes to make it to our table. And THAT was only after we pestered the waiter to check on them before our kids started having a meltdown. From our vantage point, it looked like they had ONE guy making all the ice cream AND answering the phone to deal with take-out orders. Not really his fault, but management needs to figure that one out ... FAST.  So, Burger 21 COULD be one of the best burger/beer/sundae joints in Charlotte. If they can just get the service issues worked out. Until then, I'm docking them a star.",
