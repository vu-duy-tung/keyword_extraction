However, if you wretch at Subway's preservative-laden mystery meat, chintzy portions (measured out slice by excruciating slice by disinterested stoned employees), dry bread and awful toppings, read on.  I discovered Sileo's a little less than a year ago and make the trip from Weddington once a week now -  a take-out lunch order has become part of the weekend routine for our family.  As much as I'd love to try another menu item, the Philly cheesesteak and Italian are so good and consistent, it's hard to deviate.  The turkey club comes highly recommended (wife and daughter) while our son inhales the grilled chicken.  All the signature sandwiches come on GREAT rolls, are PACKED with meat, cheese, and fresh veggies (when included/added) and they wrap in wax paper AND foil?  Why does this matter?  Takeout hot sandwiches are still fresh and piping hot after a 20 min drive (thanks to the foil), and the wax paper means they don't taste like foil!  You'll probably catch owner Steve at the flattop in back, coordinating orders or working the register.  I've watched him patiently coach nervous new employees while simultaneously working the grill and greeting customers with his arm in a sling following an injury!  Simply awesome establishment that gets everything right.",

They also don't skimp on desert if you have a sweet tooth. Do yourself a favor and try this place out, seriously, it's fantastic and you'll love it!",

I wanted to try this place after seeing so many wonderful reviews, it's conveniently located near the movies and we decided to grab lunch before the movie. This was my first time. Staff was friendly . There weren't that many people today. We chose our seats. It was about 1pm, it's a smaller place. Looks like a great selection of items. My friend wanted to order the pizza but was told they don't serve pizza on Mondays. I ordered the special number 1. Chicken wrap with lettuce, cheese, tomato, bacon & honey mustard dressing.  It was ok. Although they did forget to put the bacon. Which probably would have made the Sandwhich. Idk if I'll be back. 1st impressions are hard to make up for. But I did notice they had an awesome selection of desserts so I may come back to try that. A bit disappointed on the Sandwhich I chose.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited \"Silo's\" this afternoon for the very first tine. I have to report that the experience was a very sad one. The best part about the visit was the young man (15 yrs. old) he was more professional and courteous than the adults. They can actually learn \"customer service\" etiquette from him. Here are the details of my horrible visit.  There was another couple dining at the same time as my wife and I, they were white and we are black. The lady that works in Silo's would pass our table constantly to offer refills on their drinks and to make sure they were enjoying their meal.Only time she would say anything to my wife and I, was when I would summon here to our table before she dashed back behind the counter. One of her many trips to their table, the female worker even suggested dessert to the white couple, then hurried back behind the counter without offering my wife and I desert.  If that behavior wasn't bad enough, the owner who was cooking, came from behind the counter, walked past my wife and to share a story about the establishment next door. He walked over to the table with the white couple, shared his story and a laugh, then walked past our table without so much as an 'eye contact' and returned behind the counter.   As for my dinner, the taste was very bland. There was plenty of meat on my 'Philly Cheese Steak' however it lacked any kind of taste. Here's the finally to the whole discriminatory service we received. As I payed for my meal, my hand accidentally touched her hand during the exchange of money. The white female worker then wiped her hand on her cloths as if I were a diseased Infested person or that the blackness of my skin was hazardous. \"The more things change, the more they stay the same\". That was the first and last time I will ever frequent a bias establishment that displays discriminatory practices.   It's apparent that this is the culture of this 'mom and pop' shop located next to Sun Valley 14 theater, I only hope that their ignorant, bias, 1960's behavior doesn't affect the 15 yrs old young man, because he has a bright future ahead of him!!! I'm speaking from professional experience of 20 yrs. in the role of Sr. Customer Service Manager for various fortune 100 companies!!",

He brought us our food and told us to pay at the end. It made me feel like his friend lol. This place somehow has everything. While we were there, fresh cannolis came out of the oven. Someone else came in and got pizza. Is there anything this man CANT do?!?!?! Not all heroes wear capes.

I ordered a philly cheese steak (their no. 1 seller) with potato salad and my boyfriend got a meatball sub with French fries. One thing I love about a restaurant is serving drinks in a to go cup and not being shy about drink refills. Everything was just so on point! Our food arrived and not one disappointment it lived up to what I had heard. The sandwich was pretty big so I ended up needing a box and taking more than half home to eat later that evening. Pro tip though bring cash as you get charged a 4 percent fee for using a credit/debit card.",

    "text": "Today, I branched out and ordered the Southern Style Hotdog which consists of mustard, onions, slaw and chili. Now, me being from NC and the owner being from New York, I was curious as to how it would be. The owner assured me it was good and gave me a small sample of the chili. Ok - I'm game!  The hot dog is pretty dang good and what I really loved is that the wiener is split lengthwise before grilling it which, in my opinion, adds to the texture and flavor.  The slaw has a bit more mayonnaise than I'm used to on a hot dog but still good.  Sileo's makes a good hot dog \"all the way\" - as it's known in the south - and don't forget to add a piping hot order of french fries to your order. I would LOVE to see them add a Chicago-Style dog to their lineup - I would be first in line for that one!  I may be a southerner by birth, however, I'll order a Chicago Dog (run it through the garden!) over a hot dog ATW.      Last and definitely not least, the service, as well as their health grade have always been outstanding - a 99-100 health grade is their norm!!  It's very obvious that the owner really cares about the customer and takes pride in his restaurant and the food he offers.  This is why his deli is such a success!",

On top of all of that they have tableservice something that doesn't normally come in the deli environment.

I was dining by myself (no biggie) and the entire time, I felt as if I was intruding on a private party or something! I was very uncomfortable. The owner (I'm assuming) was exchanging pleasantries with the other costumers. Maybe if I was a regular or a friend I would have been treated better. The philly cheesesteak I ordered was about the same as one would get through any pizza delivery place. It was OK. I was really hoping it would be good. I ordered fries as well. Everything was a la carte. The total, for just me, after leaving a tip was $17 and some change! I cannot recommend this place and have absolutely no desire to dine there again. There are much better restaurants in Sun Valley.",

    "text": "Stop! Wait! Look very, very closely and before you choose either of its two behemoth neighbors - Hickory Tavern or American Burger - that it is wedged (and somewhat hidden) between, give this authentic little NY style deli a try. On each of our visits, we were greeted by its enthusiastic do-it-all owner, Steve, who obviously loves his business. The dining area is a little tight but immaculate and comfortable. A large poster on the wall makes it crystal clear who the boss is - you, the customer. The entire restaurant glistens and had a 100 sanitary rating during this visit, another indicator of pride of ownership.  A full array of burgers, sandwiches and wraps are available. The Philly Cheese Steak Hoagie and triple decker sandwiches are terrific as are the sides. They also serve up perfectly prepared breakfasts any time of the day.   On this trip, we went with the Italian hoagie and the turkey wrap with a side of fries. Both sandwiches were fresh, stuffed full of quality cold cuts and tasty (and ran about $8 each.) Unfortunately the the bread was unspectacular, which as my readers know, is a pet peeve of mine.  The fries were piping hot and delicious, but be warned they start at $2.50 for a small order. Adding in a couple of fountain drinks, our total tab came to $24 without tip, which is comparable to its more affluent neighbors. The place was packed and the service was okay even though no one offered to refill our drinks.  A wide selection of tempting desserts are also on display. The black and white cookieos were very enticing; however, I once again chose a couple of rainbow squares at 50 cents each and once again the edges were hard and they did not taste fresh so I cannot recommend the desserts (but I will keep trying.)  I plan to try the Reuben and a Black & White on my next visit. At this point,  although not a Gotta Try, it is a legitimate 4 stars and I have not regretted by-passing its better known neighbors.",

There is a counter where you order and a small dining area.  There is a dessert and cookie case that greets you as you approach the counter.  I ordered pancakes and bacon and my dad had the same plus eggs.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy, with a nice flavor, and the bacon was crispy.  My dad thought the eggs were mediocre at best.  I bought some whoopie pies before I left, because everything looked so good. Unfortunately, they were dry and I ended up throwing most of them away.  Hopefully I just made a poor choice and the other items are as good as they looked.  I would like to come back and try lunch here, as their sandwiches look delicious.
