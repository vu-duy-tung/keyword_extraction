Our waitress was fantastic and accidentally brought out the wrong tacos but brought out the right ones shortly after and they were great! I, along with 2 others, enjoyed our tacos. All were fresh and full of flavor. We could not believe they took care of our tacos for the mix up!! The food was awesome and the drinks were great too! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great tacos and margaritas. The wait may be long but this is a great place to hang out with friends!",

    "text": "I came into Bakersfield two weeks ago on a Friday night with a rather large party of friends (7). We hadn't made a reservation, so we happily agreed to wait the suggested hour for seating. We all purchased a few rounds of drinks from the bar while we waited for a table to open up. When the host grabbed us to sit, we were happy and ready to eat, however, he put us at a high top round table where we were a little crammed. It was a chillier night and the garage doors were open as well as the fans running on high. We first requested that the fans be turned lower if possible, which was quickly denied by the male host. We then kindly asked if we could be moved a few spots down to a large picnic table (that was vacant), so we could have more space for our large party as well as be a little further away from the fans. Again, our request was denied. The host informed us that the table was being held for a reservation that was about to be seated. We waited about 15 minutes and that table still had not been filled. A party did eventually move there but it was a total of 4 people. I don't understand why they couldn't have moved us (party of 7) to a table that made much more sense, and moved the smaller party that had not even arrived yet to the high top that we were at. The most disappointing factor in all of this is how rude the host was. I have worked in the restaurant industry and am well aware that the host is often the face of the company and the first interaction a guest has. His foul attitude towards us made our entire evening rather dismal. Our server was able to have the fans shut off, which we greatly appreciated, but having such poor service from the host stand really left a foul taste in all our mouths. Half of the guests with me were first timers and do not plan on returning :/",

My  $4.00 Mahi taco only had a single finger sized piece of deep fried Mahi, raw corn tortilla, and  just tasted ok.    I'm sure it would be a fun place to get a drink and watch a game.  Cabo Fish tacos still has the best by far in my opinion.",

    "text": "Sadly, I have nothing good to say.  I have been to places with much better food, service and value in Charlotte.  The tacos you receive are about the size of a large cookie and they are $3-$4 EACH...and that does not include any sides.  No beans, no rice.  Nothing.  They are more along the lines of what you get on a dollar taco night somewhere.  They were cold - not that tacos are ever served extremely warm, but these were cold in a not good way.  Unlike any other mexican themed restaurant I have been to, you pay for the chips and salsa.  What I find more confusing, rather than frustrating, is that they GIVE you two bottles of salsa.  But when the chips come to the table, they contain two dishes of the same salsa.  It makes no sense.  Let me get on to the presentation....what you order is served family style.  6 of ordered tacos, some with special requests.  Instead of being served individually, the server points out what is what on the giant pizza tray of tacos.  The special order ones had toothpicks in them.  So there were were, sliding our tacos off the tray and onto our plates.  I could go on, but I just won't go back.  I had a sweet tea and 3 tacos and my total with tip was $18.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS.  Good luck Bakersfield.  You are a rip off in every way.",

The good:  the interior is really cool- lots of wood with concrete counters to set your drink on in the bar area.  Our table was in the bar area and our service was good.  We started with queso and added the jalapenos.  It was very good!  I also had the corn chowder (it was pretty good), the Pollo Rojo taco (again, pretty good), and the short rib taco (very tasty).  It is a little weird that your order is served all together on a tray with your entire party's order.  They call it \"family style\".  It's just odd.  The bad:  The noise!  I've been to loud restaurants, but this takes it to a whole different level.  I'm talking night club music blaring loud.  They play the music so loud that everyone has to talk really loud to hear each other, which just adds to the noise issue.  Our server could not hear us even when she was right next to us.  There is no reason in has to be so loud to the point that you can't hear each other.  The ugly:  the price of their \"premium\" margarita.  At $13.00 a drink, I've had better.  I would probably give this place 3 stars, but because of the noise level, I'm not sure we will be back.",

The wood-based decor created a rustic and casual feel, and the spacious layout - featuring picnic tables, booths, and opening garage doors - was inviting and unique.  Of course, the delicious food also helped. We couldn't choose between Chips & Guacamole and Chips & Queso w/ Chorizo, so we got both to start (the perks of large parties!) and they were both terrific. We then split an artistic platter of tacos that included Fish (citrusy mahi), Mole (savory braised chicken), and the unanimous favorite, Pork Belly Pastor (very juicy, flavorful mix of sweet and spicy).  Overall, Bakersfield was a fun, casual dining experience with well-presented and delicious tacos. I will definitely try to return the next time I'm in Charlotte!",

Great place for happy hour if you're by yourself or just meeting a friend after work.  Everyone is pretty friendly so it's easy to meet people.  The later crowd is when the groups start filing in.  The \"let's take shots because we're in our 20s and am not going to pay for it the next day\" groups can get a little loud on the weekend, but not too bad on the weekdays.  The food is solid overall.  My personal favorites are the salsa, guac, Johnny salad, short rib Torta, and Bistec and Huitlacoche tacos.  Beware of the Chochinita taco...when they say hot, they mean five alarm fire hot!  Those of you who think, \"oh please, I can handle hot food.  I can handle this taco.\"  Well be prepared to bring a box of tissues, because I guarantee you'll be in tears from the heat coming off of this taco.  Don't say I didn't warn you!  The margaritas are the big winner.  Made fresh and they use good tequila.  The spicy one is really good, but depending on the bartender, you may want to ask them to cut out the spicy parts of the jalapeno if you just want the flavor (and not the heat).  Overall, this is a really fun place.  It's a great place if you're looking to meet hot guys/girls, or if you just want to sit at one of the large bench tables with a group of friends and hang out.  Good luck parking, but definitely take advantage of the valet across the street after hours on the weekend.",

    "text": "This was my second visit.  My first visit some time ago involved mostly good food and drinks, but a rotten fish taco.  So I was a little worried when I ordered the fish taco again but this time it was delicious.  Nice energy in the place, great decor and comfortable seats, food and drinks were excellent, and service could be a little better.  Tried four tacos and all were decent serving size for the price (when compared against other Charlotte competitors).  The ingredients looked bright and fresh.  The flavors and textures in the tacos stood on their own and made each one taste really good.  The tostada was excellent and the highlight of the food.  Crispy, savory, yummy! Te Pollo Rojo and the Fish were my two favorite tacos.  The Cochinita Pibil was too hot for me and it basically kicked my ass.  The Short Rib was tender and tasty.  The salsa verde they give you deserves it's own special mention.  This stuff is so darn good.  You will want to put it on everything at the table.    Servers were friendly but could have been a bit more attentive.  I visited on a Thursday and the place was jammin by 7:30pm.  There's a reason they're having success in a location where many others struggled.",

The place was so busy but we were able to find a spot at the bar while we waited for our table.   We sat towards the back and had to walk through the drink station/kitchen area which was odd (I think to avoid walking through the crowd).  We tried six different tacos and they were all excellent.  Margarita was fresh and prices weren't too bad.  Will defiantly go again! I take off a star for parking.  Always hard to find a place to park at peak hours.",

I think once you realize you can pay like 2 bucks a taco on the west coast, that 4 dollar tacos that are the size of a quarter aren't the best deal.   I got the Short Rib, Fish, Pollo Rojo and Pork Belly Pastor. I thought the taste was good but not spectacular by any means besides maybe the Short Rib.   For about $20 bucks with no sides or drinks, it's a bit pricey when you compare to other places in CLT that do tacos. It's practically empty for lunch but I could see this place doing well after work or during dinner so I can't comment too much on the atmosphere. The service was great tho.",

The bar itself was nice and comfy, usually bar stools aren't so soft.   Down to the meat of things!! Got the chips and guacamole and 3 tacos, the fish mahi mahi, the pork belly and short rib. The tacos came with 2 different sauces, one was kinda of a guacamole kinda flavour and the other had a hint of chipotle. Every single bite changed my view on Mexican food!! The guacamole is simply to die for, and each taco tasted better and better. Squeezing a lime on each was golden. Hands down, the pork belly was the best.  This was my last restaurant I visited in Charlotte and it definitely left the best impression! 5/5, would come back again and bring my girlfriend=)",

Didn't stay long on Tuesday because they didn't have any basketball games on. Thanks to Brian the owner I returned on Thursday night and had a delightful time! The food is AMAZING! The staff certainly knows their tequila as well. They even had the UNC vs Duke game on and even though they aren't a \"sports bar\" it was a great atmosphere. Nobody was there screaming or acting wild, everyone was calm. Hopefully that influences them to play sports a little more often. But this is a MUST VISIT when in charlotte!!!! Free parking garage beside the restaurant. Can't say enough about how much I had a good time tonight!!!!",

It's a really funky place to eat right on the road with those big windows that open up when the weather is good. Parking is always suuuuper fun in Dilworth but after you find a spot, enjoy yourself some chips and guacamole, a few tacos, & some tequila. Or whiskey. Whichever you prefer. The cochinita pibil tacos and the huitlacoche tacos are so good. The al pastor was a favorite with a lot of the girls I worked with, but it just wasn't my favorite. It's a bit more sweet than I like my entrees to be. Overall, I do enjoy this restaurant and wish I got to visit it more often, but it's not always the first place on the list when I'm visiting Charlotte.",

I was impressed with their cheese dip too (app) no one else does cheese dip like this around clt. It comes in a little mini skillet with cheese like blow torched on top? Idk but get it, it's delish. You have to pay for chips and dip here so might as well get some queso! Just like at rurus. ... We did wait several mins for our waitress to greet us, we came early so they weren't packed yet (no wait yet either - that's the trick too since they get busy and no reservations). Once she came she did a great job and our pitcher and app came out in mins. We ordered some tacos (they are small and not bad priced) she said \"if you want to order more just tell me they come out so fast!\" And of course we believed her. But then...that took the longest. And we literally got 3 total so we were kinda like wtf? Anyways, I liked everything I had and the inside is pretty cool looking.",

First off parking is difficult and surrounding places make it known that it is not Bakersfield parking so I was paranoid I was going to get towed. For a place that sells tacos and going on a Tuesday I expected some specials? Anyways, our waitress was not friendly at all. Drinks weren't refilled-- she did less than the bare minimum. Which honestly, sucks because I feel like if the service would have been different it may have improved the experience. We started with chips and queso. The queso is really thick but decent. I ordered 2 tacos, but for $4 each!!!!! To me, that personally is too much for something not authentic.  The tacos were good but not great.  I just expected more since this place has such good reviews and I was recommended this place by friends.",

I am not a \"day drinker\" so I will definitely be coming back to taste a margarita or two some evening in the not to distant future.  As far as our meal, we had the plain queso that I thought was really rich. I was wondering why they didn't serve salsa with their chips when i saw it right there in front of me in two squeeze bottles, one red, one green.  The green was probably the best sauce I've had on a tortilla. I also had two tacos, the fish and pork belly.  I do NOT like cilantro so thankfully I was able to get the pork belly without it but it was part of the slaw on the fish, so it was simply not to my taste.  But i ate just the fish and that by itself was pretty darn good. In short, i would definitely return.",

Do yourself a favor and get a side of habanero salsa to put on everything. The quest was pretty good, but the added chorizo was great. Service at the bar was very good. Great place for a taco fix.",

The queso dip has a good flavor, but it's very thick, not queso blanco and it's in a shallow pan, so sometimes it comes out like baked cheese rather than a cheese dip and gets cold and un-dippable fairly quickly.  They show old western movies.  They show one movie every day all day.  No sound though and no captioning.  Pandora-type music playing so it can change up quite a bit and odd with the western movie.  Parking is across Kenilworth where Kenilworth Coffee is as far as I can tell...or across East in another restaurants lot.  Something different every once in awhile.",

I had the steak and short rib tacos, queso and guac app. Fresh and flavorful. The tacos are still small but still packed with taste. This seasons sangria is a red wine with apples and a blackberry. I'm sucker for sangria so I get it every time.   Just FYI - It was just as hot inside as outside; they might as well open the garage doors since they don't do much to keep the summer out.",

BEB was SLAMMED when we got there on a Wednesday night, which lead me to believe that this place is good. Truthfully...it wasn't bad. It was pretty good...even though it was hot as hell inside.   We ordered chips, queso, and salsa as an appetizer and it was ok. Nothing special but it was a sufficient thing to snack on while waiting for our food. I ordered a short rib torta that came with mild salsa...it was pretty good in the \"it's filling\" way, not in the \"this is delicious\" way. The rest of them got some variation of tacos, and apparently not enough, because they were all still hungry. Their beer options were pretty limited. They only had a few beers on tap, but their bottle list was a bit more dynamic.   I'd possibly consider going back if/when I find myself in Charlotte again. It wouldn't be the first thing want, but I wouldn't be mad if the group wanted to go. It was a-ok",

The $4 taco was smaller that what you would expect, but it tasted good. Everything is ala carte . Chips and salsa is $4. Add some cheese dip and guacamole and you add $10 to the tab. There is also a very limited menu. No dinner plates, nachos, enchiladas, steak of any kind or anything unusual.  Nice interior and quick friendly service. Don't bring the kids. Most seating is tall stools at small tables. Great for a date. The drinks look refreshing and the shots were generous.",

Not your traditional Mexican restaurant, its better.

Their queso, along with the additions of chorizo and pickled jalapenos, gets my vote for best queso (and chips) in Charlotte. That statement is backed up by my mom who constantly craves Bakersfield's queso. Their chips are gloriously lightly salted, crispy delights.  The margaritas are just so good that I have to truly pace myself when drinking one....or a couple. I always say the next time I visit I'm going to try the spicy margarita but the classic wins me over every time.   The staff is tops. I went to Bakersfield on my 30th birthday (because 30 calls for margs and tacos, duh) and they brought me out a complimentary shot as well as filled my own specialized birthday cup with their margarita goodness.   Parking is still a nightmare so either Uber or utilize the free valet service across the street at Berrybrook.",

I've been to Bakersfield an number of times and it has been great every single time. Went on a whim Wednesday night with my fiancee and her sister. It was busy, so we put our name on the list and mingled around. We ended up finding seats at the bar pretty quickly though.  We got an appetizer of chips and guacamole, which was phenomenal. The guac was thick and flavorful and the chips were very.... chippy? I ordered the \"Red Headed Stranger\" to drink, which had a strong but no overpowering Old Forester kick to it. And since Willie Nelson sang \"Red Headed Stranger\", I stuck with the theme and ordered the \"Willie\" from the ensalada menu. It was a \"fiesta salad\" type deal with roasted chicken, bacon, black beans, corns, etc. and a very good buttermilk ranch dressing that I believe they make in-house. Just enough spice to let you know you're still alive.   Only annoyance is that there is close to ZERO parking for Bakersfield, and all the neighboring businesses make that clear. There is limited road parking up to the corner of Kenilworth and East, other than that you can valet or risk parking in the lot of another business.",

    "text": "I went to this restaurant while in town visiting friends. After ordering, our server did not come back to the table for over 25 minutes. We needed refills on drinks and began to wonder if there was an update on our food. Eventually we received our food, but we were missing two entrees. Our server did not seem to notice. We had to ask for the missing entrees several times by hunting the server down. One entree came out 10 minutes after the other food, but the other was still missing. Our server then disappeared. It was almost an hour since ordering food and over 20 minutes since the first entrees were brought to the table. We saw our server peak out of the kitchen, notice we saw her, and run away. It was not until I pulled our server out of the kitchen to inform her I no longer wanted the food I had waited an hour for because I did not want anything to do with this restaurant, including the food, that the manager FINALLY involved herself in the situation. Only to tell us she was too busy to acknowledge the poor experience we were having.   I was shocked by the lack of service at such a cool place, and even more surprised by the lack of apology by the front of house staff and management. I am still not sure what the hiccup was- whether our server forgot to ring in the rest of the food, there was a hiccup in the kitchen, or whatever it was, it is the JOB of the front of house staff to manager customers expectations and make up for mistakes.",

    "text": "Updated Review:  I've left my original review below, but after receiving a gift card to return and giving Bakersfield another shot.  I had the exact same food as the previous time, but I successfully identified what ruined my meal on my previous experience.  Our chips salsa and guacamole came out before the lights were dimmed this time and I was able to see the mounds of salt on the chips.  I enjoyed them this time however, as I brushed off copious amounts of salt before eating the chips.  I was therefore able to enjoy my tacos and I would highly recommend the fish taco!  The salsas and guacamole are fantastic as well without the overly salty chips.  Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 starts, but am limited to 3 with Yelp.  I'm also likely to return from time to time on my own dime and eat the fish tacos, but I will probably take my own tortilla chips.  Also, this time, our food came out in sequence of the orders around us and ours along with the tables around us came out much faster as well.    Original Review:  This might be the absolute worst food I have ever eaten.  We had the chips, guacamole, and two salsas as an appetizer and a total a five of the smallest street tacos I have ever seen at $4 a piece.  The only flavor from every single bite of food was salt.  I actually had blisters on the roof of my mouth and lips from all of the salt.  I recommend eating a banana for some potassium to balance the sodium in your body if you eat at Bakersfield, which we never will again.  The service was slow and most of the tables around us that ordered after us received their food before us.  If I put want some flavor filled Latin American food and would like it sooner than later at a more friendly price, I highly recommend Sabor Latin Grill any day of the week and especially Tuesday's for $1 taco day.",

I always get the Pollo Rojo because it is to die for. I have actually battled the parking for some takeout one time just for those flavorful tacos. The chicken Milanese is huge and is also extremely good.  Weird as it sounds, this place has some of the best/ strongest mimosas and bloody Mary's, which are not put juice, but instead a nice mix of seasonings and liquor.  The only downside is the parking. There are a ton of signs in the parking garage and nearby that say \"No parking for Bakersfield customers.\" My guess is that the other businesses are just jealous! You are better off taking an Uber there.",

We thought it was becoming such a serious addiction that now we try to limit ourselves to bi-weekly visits.   Let's see, the place itself is very cool. I like the decor, the picnic tables, the huge bar, the johnny cash music, and the old west movies. Right away, it feels very homey.   Next, the food. TT has tried every taco, tostada, and torta, and is always happy with whatever he gets. As for me, two milanesa tortas just inst enough - I love them!! The milanesa chicken is always cooked perfectly and the avocado lemon mayo is so refreshing and tasty. They are the perfect size and I am basically ALWAYS craving them. When it comes to the tacos, short rib all the way. This has to be everyones favorite - its so juicy and tender - ugh, heaven! I have a little secret - I ask for the short rib torta as a tostada. Extra meat, crunchy taco, and a little lettuce - it's the perfect compliment to my two milanesa sandwiches!!   I think their margaritas are quite tasty and a bang for your buck. In fact, the whole menu is very well priced, in my opinion. I feel like we eat very well and don't walk out poor. I thought their limited menu would get boring quick but I was wrong. I am so happy this placed opened up and that its so close to me because if any place is going to become my 'Cheers,' it's Bakersfield.",

    "text": "Like most hipster restaurants, this one has both its go-to signature qualities that it does well, as well as some things to just straight up avoid.   First of all, the chips aren't free. Grow up, Bakersfield--you salt the things so heavily, so as to make your customers thirsty, yet charge $3 for a basket of them. Granted, the salsas are pretty good, and the guacamole ($7) is very good, but come on--chips should be free.   Moving on to the tacos: maybe it's just as well (for their benefit) they charge for the chips, because unless you have lots of cash to drop, you'll want to fill up on them before your tacos arrive. These tapas-sized morsels are absolutely exquisite--go for the Pork Pastor with pineapple or the prime rib, but skip the fish--but are so small for the price; three are barely a satisfying lunch. At $3-4 a pop, you're talking about dropping at least $15-16 before even thinking about booze. Or chips.   Bakersfield has a few good strengths, but there are a couple of drawbacks--including the parking situation--that keep it from being a True home run. Will I return? Sure, but only if I can find a parking space. Sunday afternoon was a good time to go.",

Pork belly was dry and not fatty at all (that last part may or may not be a good thing depending on your perspective). The toppings were good. I did not like the short rib one at all. Not my bag of chips. Now, the fish was pretty darn good.  Crunchy fried with s nice combination of toppings. Oh and I almost forgot, they make their own tortillas and they are solid!  However, best thing of the night was the guacamole. It was different. Very chunky and I like the fact that it was all avocado. I hate guac that's muddled with tomatoes and other ingredients. This was perfectly lime green avocado and lots of garlic for a change. Perfectly seasoned creamy chunks. I've been craving the guacamole ever since. Need to go back and taste a few other tacos.",

I think we managed to beat the crowd by going closer to 6 pm than to 7. The decor is very hipster and modern. It gives off great vibes and creates a wonderful environment.  You can pick however many of each taco you want, and you can keep ordering if you want more. I recommend trying two or three to start and then going from there. The tacos come out all on one platter for the whole table, so remember which ones you ordered and what the server says they are when they get to you!   I ordered two of the pork belly pastor tacos and one of the conchinita pibil tacos, which are both pork. The conchinita pibil taco did not impress me too much, but the pork belly pastor may have been the very best taco I have ever eaten. A marinated pork with pineapple, onion, and cilantro? Oh yes. And each taco comes with a lime slice next to it, so feel free to add a little extra flavor to your taco!   The service was absolutely wonderful, as well. Our server was more than willing to answer all our questions and give recommendations. The food also came out incredibly quickly - we were in an out in no time.  The only downside is the parking. Because they have a corner location, they really don't have their own parking lot. They have a free valet and the market across the street, but we didn't see that until after we had parked at the Jersey Mike's across the street. I don't know how they feel about that, but our car was still there and ticket-less when we came out, so no harm no foul?",

Every Time I order the Cochinita Pibil taco they let me know how spicy it is that particular day which is great for two reasons: one, they are aware of what they're serving and, two, it means the marinade or sauce is made fresh.   In fact, everything tastes fresh. Their green salsa tastes like fresh cut grass in the best way possible.  Also, anytime I bring in a new friend or the night is busy and service is even slightly slow, they make the effort to give a free app or drink to show they want my business.  They will have my business as long as I'm in town and they're here!",

    "text": "Bakersfield.. a hipster taco joint off of East Blvd. A must-visit if you haven't been there. Seems like a cool hang-out spot.   LOCATION East Blvd, crap parking (seriously, don't come here with a car).  AMBIANCE Hipster, lots of wood, garage-door windows. There are high-top seating, booth seating, as well as bench-style seating. The light bulbs are inside of wisks. How cool is that! There are a few tvs here that play some of the bigger games that are on. Not a sports bar though.   FOOD Guac and chips - Guac is chunky. Super chunky. Very limey and topped with radishes. The chips were really good - thin and really light. They were lightly salted and slightly limey.   Tacos - pretty expensive but yummy. The portions are small so be prepared. The toppings aren't always typical but just trust Bakersfield.. they know what they're doing.   Tostada - super yummy. If this is your first time, we recommend the one with chicken and mole. It is delicious! It feels like eating a lightly dressed salad topped with super delicious shredded chicken layered with crispy tostada.   We haven't checked out their bar just yet.. so we'll update the review once we do!",

My drink order was taken and served fast. Ordering my food though was another story. It took over 15 minutes to get someone's attention for me to be able to order. In that time I was passed by multiple people behind the bar, many of them refusing eye contact once it was made. Many times these people were just joking around with each other not paying attention. Once I was finally able to order my food the bartender did apologize and said he was not trying to ignore me twice. I appreciate that but still not acceptable that others walked by as well nor does it fix the problem. I ended up ordering my food to go because I was so disappointed in the service. I will note when I got there they were busy but it slammed. When I left they were slammed.",

    "text": "With a name like \"Bakersfield\", I have to admit I wasn't immediately thinking great taco place.  That said, after going there I can say that this is a great taco place!  It's located right in the middle of Dilworth on East Blvd.  Parking is trouble but they have free valet right across the street.  It's a pretty cool vibe on the inside, looks very modern and hip and all those other buzz words to describe the types of places that yuppies enjoy.    One of the things I really like about this place is that the tacos are a la carte so you can go your own way and mix and match.  My favorites thus far are the pork belly pastor and the fish taco.    Another thing about this place is that they serve the hell out of some whiskey and tequila.  So that's cool.  Apparently Bakersfield has locations in other cities, but it still doesn't feel like a chain-type place so that is a plus.  Good tacos at a reasonable price is always a winner for me.",

I initially gave this place 2 stars, but it was when they first opened and they have done a great job of working some of the kinks out. The margaritas are some of the best I've ever had and the guacamole as well as the queso are awesome. The tacos are pretty solid, nothing to \"wow\" over though. It's a great watering hole to check out with friends! Be wary of the constant crowd. Seats at the bar are usually available during the week, no problem, but you'll be hard pressed to get a table during peak hours on any night.",

We started with the guacamole which was very good Then between my girlfriend and I we ordered six different tacos so that we didn't have any of the same thing She only ate two of hers... More for me!! So I ended up stuffing my face and eating four tacos: Mole, short rib, Pork belly and the steak taco My only complaint about the taco was the steak taco had a lot of stuff on it and could barely be contained in the tortilla so it was a little difficult to eat but still delicious!  Otherwise all was good!!  The parking situation is difficult We ended up having to park across the street in the jersey mikes lot Is there a designated lot for Bakersfield?!",

The evening didn't start well. Parking is a hot mess but that is just the area. They do offer complimentary valet out of the Berrybrook lot across the street. Limited street parking is it for people that aren't keen on valet.  We started with a Don Julio tequila flight, a cerveza and chips & guac ($7). Honestly, I found it irritating that chips and salsa weren't gratis. I really enjoyed the guac. It was super chunky with the right amount of lime, salt and cilantro. They brought bottles of salsa to go with the tacos, so I sampled those with chips. The green salsa was incredibly mild and slightly bland. The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and subtle spiciness.   We ordered an assortment of tacos - pork belly pastor, fish taco, short rib, and a spicy pork. They were served family style on a platter. The food had a visual appeal but none of them blew me away. Especially for $4 a pop.   Overall, they were close to meeting the 4 star mark. Drop the prices and bring me chips & salsa on the house.",

Even with the bartenders he lends a helping hand to grab that top shelf bottle of tequila when they can't reach (he's the tall one of the litter lol). But the underlying theme here is that Bakersfield does everything they do with a passion and with customer experience in mind.   5 stars every time! Get the queso!!!",

A taco is basically a Mexican snack, meal or sandwich filled with different things.  Meats, fish and veggies are standard.  Bakersfield offers tacos like:       Fish (crispy mahi)     Baja Shrimp (crispy shrimp)     Pollo Rojo (Red chicken = braised chicken)     Al Pastor (chili marinated pork)     Cochinita Pibil (achiote braised pork...HOT)     Bistec (marinated grilled short rib)     Short Rib (braised short rib)     Hongos (mushrooms)     Huitlacoche (very special...this is fermented corn, basically a molded corn)       Each taco comes with other items, like cheeses, veggies, etc.  Tostadas, an open-faced taco on a crisp tortilla are available plus tortas or sandwiches, especially a Cuban pressed pork, ham and cheese sandwich.  All of these go down well with beer and cocktails.  Servers and service is great.  Responsive and personal.  Simple concept for a fun occasion.",

    "text": "What better way to celebrate Cinco de Mayo than try a new Mexican restaurant that one of my Yelp Friends raves about EVERY TIME I see her! lol *shouts out to Saniqua!!* Ok so I finally made it to Bakersfield and on Cinco de Mayo before the crowds flooded the restaurant.   The parking situation is not as bad as people have warned me about. There is a parking deck in the center of the building Bakersfield is located and it was free for us to park (as far I know, we did not pay lol) and there was several spots available in the deck.   We were quickly seated at a table and started with Tequila. Whiskey. and then Tacos. lol I know this is not the Bakersfield order but my friends and I needed a drink first before anything else. We ordered a pitcher of the margarita which was a great deal compared to buying individual drinks for each of us. The margarita was amazing, not too strong but strong enough to get our Cinco de Mayo started off right! The pitcher was enough for myself and my 2 friends to all get 2 small glasses each.   We ordered the chips and Queso for the table because we are always so indecisive on what to order for entrees. I was not crazy about the queso, it was good but a little too thick in consistency for preference but I constantly ate the chips throughout the meal.   I finally decided on what tacos to order after an extensive search on Yelp and sipping my margarita. The general consensus on Yelp was to go with the chicken taco, the fish taco or the short rib taco. I decided to go with the chicken and the short rib because if you cant get the basics down and perfected, that's a no bueno! lol I was not disappointed in my tacos. They were really good and had a lot of flavor. I think the short rib taco was my favorite and I could've probably ordered a 3rd taco without feeling totally disgusted with myself.  The service was awesome. Our waitress read our minds and split our tickets 3 ways for the margarita pitcher and the queso which is excellent service to me. The restaurant quickly filled up by the time we finished our meal and seems like a great hang out spot on the weekends or evenings. The bar was packed. So thanks to Saniqua, I am a fan of Bakersfield and will be back for a pitcher of margaritas.",

Thankful to be alive, we were greeted warmly by two hostesses and seated immediately.  I really liked the interior and the space. We were seated at a high top near the bar and not too close to the huge open windows in front which lets us enjoy the nice weather outside. We were about get a margarita pitcher (64 oz) but wisely reconsidered after doing the math of how much the two of us would actually drink and because it was 11 am. John got the Bakersfield one and I tried the Seasonal Margarita. Both were refreshing and had a generous lining of salt on the glass rim.  Food was great! Not only did it come out fast but everything was fresh. I really enjoyed the fresh made tortilla chips that were warm and crispy. Just the right amount of salt. The guacamole was very good, with the right balance of chunky and creamy. For tacos I tried the fish which was crispy and balanced with the tart and sour slaw and the short ribs which were tender. My brother inhaled his 3 tacos (he's been here before).  The meal was worth crossing the street again.",

    "text": "Talk about yummy tacos! I had always heard about this place and apparently always drove past it not realizing what it was. With a name like Bakersfield the last thing you would think they serve is tacos and tequila. The first time I visited i wasn't able to try any food because they were slammed and entirely too busy for me to enjoy so I grabbed a drink and then left. I would recommend giving yourself at least 30-1hr as far as wait time in case you're hungry. We did learn when we were there however that they have $2 tacos after 10pm. The second time around I was able to have the queso as my appetizer and try the Baja shrimp, fish, and huitlacoche (a veggie corn) tacos. The queso was soooooo good. It tasted like the perfect cheese blend and was baked to perfection. All three tacos were amazing to me!! They seafood tasted fresh and didn't seem all that processed. Surprisingly though, my favorite was the veggie taco it had corn truffles, poblano, and black bean. It had me sold and I cannot wait to go back....especially to try the guac next",

We got 12 or so tacos as a team -- personally, I got the braised short rib and the pork belly.  They were both delicious, but all of them looked really good.  This was the first lunch spot I went to with my work squad over the summer, and we probably proposed it at least once a week from then on for lunch -- ultimately, there were just so many other places we wanted to try!  I'd go again if I were near East Blvd more often.",

The salsa was green, which was unique. Fresh, but not too spicy. They could bottle the salsa and sell it on its own. I had the steak taco, the al pastor, and the fish taco. The fish taco was so busy that I could hardly taste the fish. The al pastor had very fatty, chewy meat, and the steak taco isn't memorable so I can't tell you about it.   There was very little crowd, to be expected on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar to eat and the service was good. The bartender answered all of our questions and was prompt. It didn't take long for food to arrive. Food was hot and served on one large platter. Overall, I thought that Bakersfield was just okay. If you're looking for tacos, I'd go elsewhere.",

I adore this corner spot simply because of the roll up windows, introducing fresh air and smiling faces from walkers in the dilworth area.   They offer a variety of beers on draft and by the bottle; reasonably priced with a few being as low as $4. The tacos average about $4/$5 per taco. But keep in mind, they're about 4in so it's recommended that you have 3-4 for a full meal. For a quick lunch, 2 and a drink will serve you just fine.   Overall, I like this place as I've been a few times before on random occasions and the service is always great, drinks are always strong and the food is always fresh. Give them a try... you will not regret it!",

If you go in really hungry like us, you might want to plan on getting two orders. The chips don't come free. But the food is fresh though not plentiful. The ambience and crowd are good and you could keep drinking till 2am, and that's when they close. Would I recommend it, yes if you are drinking and no if you go in with hopes of filling your tummy.",

The atmosphere inside was a huge change from Longboards, which operated in the space not too long ago.   Inside is now wood grain floors and comfy dark leather booths. The booths are shaped in a semicircle which make the space feel more open than the standard square booths that most restaurants have. On the walls they have TVs playing Clint Eastwood western movies. And above the bar is a nice selection of Tequila bottles.  I ended up trying multiple tacos, with my favorite being the short rib. They make the tortillas in house, and you can taste it in how fresh the tortillas are. I also enjoyed the chicken mole taco which had delicious pickled red onions on top. The tacos are slightly on the small side, but they sure are good.  The staff was friendly and very helpful in giving me suggestions for tequila to sip on. Overall, I was impressed with the food and service and look forward to trying them again.",

    "text": "I loved the ambiance of the place first of all. The low lighting and cool light bulbs made for a modern chic feeling, but the Johnny Cash and June Carter playing in the background completed the rockabilly whiskey and tequila drinking theme. The hardwood floors and seating arrangements were nice and made the place feel comfortable.  Started off with a pitcher of bakersfield margaritas which hit the spot right away. I'd had a long weekend on my feet, and my friend had just gotten off the interstate from a long distance haul, so this 64 oz concoction of tequila and fresh sour mix was much needed. Pretty cool that it comes with a huge paddle of a spoon to play with (at least that's what I did with it), though I'm sure it's truly meant for stirring purposes.   Ordered some guacamole to accompany said beverages, and it was tasty and fresh. huge Chunks of avocado lead me to believe they don't use the crap that comes out of a bag. For entrees we ordered (from most favorite to least) the mole, conchinita pibil, short rib, and fish tacos, which were served \"family style\". Mole sauce was perfect, and the meat was tender. The habenero sauce on the pibil taco lends it the perfect kick at the end of your bite. Loved it. Short rib with the radish was great, but it just tasted like short rib, and nothing more. I wanted to love the fish taco, but didn't. Perhaps I'm just a picky fish taco eater,  but I've had way better. The slaw, however, was a nice refreshing crunch of a bite.  Service was great from the time we walked in the door,  to the time we walked out the door. They'd only been open a week- so the staff seemed a little intense, but I think that intensity will calm once the place gets settled. Will definitely be coming back as I enjoyed my meal over all, and the reprieve the margaritas offered!!  W",

We love a great guacamole and they did not disappoint!  It's easy to see why this is a popular place.  We will be back!",

She was funny and cracking jokes with us all night. The entire staff did a great job I will be back I love this place.",

Pork belly taco was my least favorite but the short rib was the bomb. The margs were very good! They make their mix in house which is nice. Skillet queso was better than I expected and so was he guac. I have VERY high standards for my guac and this place delivered. Nice and chunky like a casero! Yum!  Service was pretty terrible, but I never review solely on one bad service experience so hopefully next time the people will be happier!",

Pros: queso (add chorizo and beans); guacamole, salsa, CHICKEN CHORIZO TOSTADA; premium margarita  Cons: parking can be an issue, but if you figure out the valet guys across the street it's actually very simple; no reservations so be patient and enjoy the atmosphere; house margaritas could be better as could their wine list.  Overall their food and atmosphere gives this place an easy 4-star! You'll find yourself craving everything on the menu!!",

I waited about 10 minutes for my waitress to come back around just so I can order the drink. But the chips and quest was delicious. Margaritas are great also.

Chips and salsa and some local beers. \"Hey...they just delivered our chips and salsa to the table next to us.\" They kept them anyhow.  Grrrr!!  \"Oooh, their salsa verde is on point!\" \"It is...now, check out the smokey red...delicious!\" Kind of thought the whole \"chipotle\" thing had played itself out...but found myself to be wrong, as the house salsa is quite terrific!  \"Look at the selection of tacos!\" I may be in love, as I make several of these at home. We tried many, but the big winner was the pork belly. Perfectly done! Perfectly!  Loved the beer, loved the food, loved the place.  My only advice would be to add a bit more sauce to the fish taco and deliver the chips and salsa to MY table next time.  Try: The pork belly tacos with some bourbon to sip  Avoid: Ummm...nothing...everything was great!",

The Hitman and I ventured here last week for dinner and drinks. It was rocking for a Wednesday evening.   I love the decor. The cool old school light bulb type fixtures that hang, garage doors opening to the sidewalk, vintage Western movie playing on the tv... great vibe.  We started with guac. Loved the fresh radish garnish on top. I went with tacos... one short rib and one pastor. Both were pretty good, but I would declare the short rib the winner in a face-off.  Drink special alert: PBR's are just $2 every day and come in a boot. Disclaimer: not an actual boot, but a glass shaped like a boot. As hard as it was to pass up a boot, I decided on a margarita(s). Salted rim and mason jar for the win!   Staff is ridiculously nice. Seriously, it felt like 45 different people checked on us. We chatted with the manager as well. So friendly.   If you don't live in this hood, here's where it gets tricky. And this has been the problem for every restaurant in this space: parking. They don't have a lot. Be wary about parking in the Harris Teeter. The peeps there are not happy about it. Bakersfield does offer valet across the street at Berrybrook.  Best of luck to Bakersfield. I'm a big fan!",

Chips and queso with chorizo, Willie salad, and the conchinita pibil and short rib tacos are the go-tos. Service is a major issue here, however. The staff generally seems disinterested and getting servers' attention can be an issue. On our last visit, we were not attended to by a server for two separate 30 minute periods. It took us more than half an hour just to order our entrees. What we thought would be a quick stop in for some tacos ended up a nearly 90 minute ordeal. This experience was the worst we've had, but by no means surprising after lackluster service on past visits. This last trip may have put us over the edge and I'm not sure if we will be back due to service, despite how much we like the food.",

My only real disappointment was the service. Our waitress was really slow to tend to our needs. She didnt come back for a really long time to provide refills or allow us to order. I wish she would have told me lemonade was not free refills when asking if I wanted another one. If I had known  that, I would have gotten a water towards the end of my meal not a $3 lemonade I couldn't finish.",

We have had every taco on the menu, all are exceptional, of course there is even a vegetarian taco for those people. :) Parking can be a bit tricky, if you do not valet, but look around and there is usually always parking close by. Perfect times to go if you are not wanted to be in the mainstream nightly crowd is between 4 - 6:30 pm. After 6:30 almost nightly they are packed and you should expect the noise level to be loud and the service to take just a little longer as they have a full house.",

They do offer FREE valet, so that's good ! The decor inside is cool! Johnny Cash cool! Loved the barrel tables! We sat at the bar! I saw a nice mixture of people in the crowd. I disagree that one of the previous reviews said \"holy hipster\"!  The bartenders (all three ) were very attentive! Cobra is a sweetheart! They have my favorite beer, Sol, in bottles and it's only $3 per! A great start! Cobra was very helpful in making food recommendations! The  queso is outstanding! The best I've ever had! The previous review said otherwise! I totally disagree! It was awesome! Tacos were very good, too! We had 2 beers, sangria, queso, tacos and were stuffed! And the bill was only $27! We will be back!

Last Sunday we had a tall guy with brown hair as our waiter, his name might have been Steven (he looked European). He was very knowledgeable about that menu and specifically the drinks.

Last night during dinner, we were sat next to the most obnoxious group of women looking for as much attention as possible by screaming at the top of their lungs the entire dinner.....at 7pm on a Tuesday. When the waiter asked if we'd like another drink after dinner I told him I couldn't stand to sit next to these women another minute and we had our next round of drinks at the bar instead to try and distance ourselves from the screaming ladies. After we ordered our drinks, the owner came over to personally apologize for the ladies ludicrous behavior and even bought us that round of drink....definitely unnecessary but an amazing gesture; especially because one bad table wouldn't be enough to keep us away from their pollo rojo tacos and spicy margs! Will continue to be a regular spot for us in Charlotte when looking for fast, great Mexican.",

I came here on a Tuesday night for a quick dinner and left very happy. We started with the chips and queso. The queso at Bakersfield is very different from your normal mexican restaurant queso. It is thicker and has a smoky flavor. I love it but some of my friends hate it. You honestly have to try it to see if you will truly like it. My friend and i both got tacos and were very happy. I got a fish taco and a mole taco. The mole is very solid, but the fish taco stole the show. The crispy mahi was perfectly breaded and added a great crunch to the taco. My friend being vegetarian got the Hongos and the Huitlacoche tacos. He was really happy with both of them. Also, I do remember from the Columbus location that the Margarita's are a step above.  They are super strong and will hit you in the face like a pile of bricks.",

They are very small (and expensive for that size) and flimsy, which means almost impossible to eat with your hands.  They should at least have 2 tortillas so that they hold up better.

The hostess (I can't remember her name, but it was the same one all 3 times we went) gave us so much attitude and did not make us feel welcome at all, like we were an annoyance and how dare we bring kids... Sorry, but they have to eat too.  She wanted us to sit at a bar top table and have the high chair sit in the aisle, kind of nestled under the table.  My son is 1.5, has been eating everything we eat for about 10 months so there is so way that would have worked or he would have been happy with his head 3-ish ft below table height.  She got annoyed and rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could sit at a lower table so he could eat with us.

Our friends are obsessed with Bakersfield - so our first double date, it was a no-brainer that they took us here. Drinks flowing, chips and guac plentiful and tacos by the pound - I instantly fell in love and knew why Bakersfield was their second home.  The Tacos They're served on a big platter - family style. These bad boys will come out looking the size of street tacos. Looks can be deceiving because they're jam-packed with yummy goodness and after 2, you'll be feeling full. Huitlacoche- might be my favorite taco because it's roasted with corn truffles, poblano, cotija cheese and some cilantro. The Baja Shrimp is a close second. Apparently, this taco made it's debut to the menu last summer and it was so popular that they've kept it on the menu...that's saying something.   The Tequila Oh, baby, baby. If you're looking for a drink to share that's stiff then look no further than The Bakersfield Margarita. It's the perfect combo of summery goodness mixed up in your glass that will leave you feeling fly after the first sip.   The Ambiance Classy with a touch of hipster. I'm not entirely sure how to explain the ambiance other than it's an experience. The restaurant isn't huge, but it doesn't feel crowded when you walk in or are waiting for a table. You have options for tall tops to shared tables.   The Service   On point. I am always looking for a server who is attentive. I haven't had a bad server here yet. They're always coming back asking if you need something, or anticpiate your every move. That's what I like.   We've been here several times with this couple and alone. Bakersfield is a wonderful place to sit back, relax and enjoy some tacos with your pals.",

The queso had a lot of flavor. And the fish and chicken tacos were delicious. And reasonable prices, IMO. One need-to-know, fyi, is the parking. All lots and garages in its immediate area specifically say 'no parking for Bakersfield'. We learned you can park across at Giving Tree Reality, though maybe during certain hours?

Absolutely delicious food, fantastically fresh ingredients, varied and interesting menu for food and beverages, BUT the \"background\" music is obnoxiously loud--so loud that table conversation is rendered exceptionally difficult, and we are reduced to literally yelling at one another while at table. This isn't a nightclub, and I get that the vibe needs a fun tone--but truly, the music NEEDS to be turned down several notches!",

    "text": "Love this place. Come here all the time for the pitcher of margarita which is always a great choice. Their queso with everything (black beans, chorizo, and jalapenos) is amazing! It's comes in a little cast iron skillet to keep it warm with fresh warm chips. They have some really good tacos as well, my favs are the fish, baja shrimp, and short rib. The atmosphere is very chill and relaxing, great for a date night or a night out with friends. The one thing I wish they had would be drink specials on holidays like National Margarita Day, National Tequila Day, or Cinco de Mayo because they usually have signs about them but never an specials when you go in.  Other than the queso & pitcher of margaritas, I love that they have ample amount charging outlets.",

They have these big glasses garage doors along the side of the building and when it's warm out they open them up and it feels great. We started out with the chips and queso. Sooooo goood. I got three tacos, fish, shrimp and pork. They were all delicious but my favorite was the pork because of the combination with pineapples! I will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "What started as a difficult decision on where to eat tacos ended in a perfect dinner at Bakersfield. This was my first experience eating here and I left quite impressed. My gut was telling me \"Sabor\" but I also wanted to try something new and since it was suggested by my girlfriend I obliged.  $4 tacos across the board-not sure if this is the typical pricing or if they were on special. The taco fillings were delicious, especially the fish and shrimp. They came in corn tortillas, which I love, just not soft. This was my mistake as I should have asked the waiter to make sure they were crispy. Unfortunately with the taco ingredients it made for a soggy shell. Nonetheless the tacos were still very good.  If you are a fan of corn tortillas, take the time to ask for them to be crispy and you will thank yourself after. I liked the high booths and circular pub table that we were seated at. The lighting is not too bright and creates a nice ambiance in the restaurant. It was a bit loud here for a Tuesday night and they could have benefitted from turning down the volume just a bit. Overall I was very pleased with this place!",

    "text": "I've enjoyed Bakersfield twice now, each time choosing very different food options. Initially I was very interested in the 'whiskey' part of the 'whiskey and tacos' because I like both of those things but when I got there was just as interested in the food too.  Its spacious inside but it's a place I could hang a while. The bar is large and I noticed purse hooks as well as electrical sockets and cable hook ups too. They really want you to sit at the bar alllll day. Very well thought through!  I always look at liquor selection at places. While Bakersfield does offer plenty of whiskey, I was impressed with their tequila too. They have Casamigos, Lunazul (my house brand) and numerous others. On my first visit I had the pineapple margarita which was very concentrated in flavor which was great since it still tasted good as ice started to melt. On the 2nd visit, I got a Sol beer because I like them and they are not super easy to come by.  Food wise, I got tacos one visit and the Cochinita Pibil torta. A torta is a sandwich but served on a telera roll which is pretty large and round. It was enough to share. It was full of spicy braised pork, guacamole and black beans.  To start we shared the chips and queso and I swear the queso is partly pureed white beans or something because the texture is so good and isn't super greasy, well except for the cheese melted on the top.  As with anywhere off of E Blvd, parking can be tricky but every time we have gone, we have found a street spot. Next time we might not be so lucky!",

Only minor concern was the slight delay in ordering after we received our drinks (~15min), but the tacos were well worth the wait!  Have been there 3 times and intend to return for more tacos (which I'm already craving)!",

Despite being the only bartender on, and only having just one server on the floor, I think the ladies handled everything impeccably... I honestly don't believe anyone (6 tables, 3 bar groups) ever had to wait to order or receive what they needed.  The a la carte tacos are a little small, but big on flavor.  The fresh, homemade skillet queso is unlike most others though - great consistency and the perfect amount of spice!  You know this didn't come out of a jar   I feel like Bakersfield has lost a little bit of its spunk in recent months, but I hear there are some positive changes/improvements on the horizon... I look forward to coming back again soon!!",

They have a nice tequila selection (would love it even more if you would stock Ocho Tequila) and appear to have a good bourbon selection.  The guacamole is really good along with the sauces. I have now tried all of the tacos--favs are the braised beef and the mole tacos. The others are great too--full of flavor!  Typically very fast but I think they lost our order last night as it took a while and the manager came to apologize. Not a big deal as they were slammed.

If you like heat, go for the spicy version of any of their margaritas. The spicy pineapple one is definitely my favorite though. The Cochinita Pibil tacos are SO good. They are just the right amount of spicy and savory. The fish (crispy mahi) tacos and shrimp tacos are also really good. They are very crispy but yet the mahi is still flaky and delicious! Also, you cannot go wrong with ordering their Queso, especially with Jalapenos on it.",

I spent a year searching for a great taco, tostada, or margarita that I could easily find out West. I couldn't find anything here for a whole year. So missing good Mexican food was one of the toughest things in my move here.   A few weeks ago I just stumbled onto Bakersfield by accident. I've been here a number of times since. It is definitely the best authentic Mexican I've had in the city. The food is just on point and every time. It's not pretentious but it's a very nice place as well - the decor is great, the service is great, and it fits right into the Dilworth neighborhood.  The servers and bartenders have all been totally cool. One of the bartenders in particular, Karl, has been great. He's very attentive and has been really welcoming to me and my friends.   I think I've finally found my neighborhood Mexican joint in the neighborhood - finally a piece of the West in Charlotte. I definitely recommend it!",

I filled up on that, and barely had room for my entree--which ended up being okay because the tacos were lackluster.  I ordered the al pastor tacos and the meat was either overcooked or just too chewy.  I nibbled but left a majority of it on my plate.",

Let me tell you how much I hated the parking though!!  There is no parking area for the restaurant since it is a corner building. There is free valet, but we weren't interested.  So, we tried parking in the Harris Teeter parking lot in from of the CLOSED businesses who obviously do not need the parking spaces.  We were met by an ancient security guard who was actively chasing people down harassing them about not parking there if they were patrons of the new restaurant.  This man literally would yell across the parking lot at people and chastise them about why they were parking there.   NOT cool for business in the Dilworth area, and if I had a closed business there, I would want people to park there for a free advertising opportunity!  This would allow customers of the restaurant to see businesses they may not otherwise know were there!!  Anyway, the cocktails at the restaurant were beyond amazing.  The atmosphere was dark and had drop lighting using old fashioned bulbs that gave the place an awesome ambiance.  The waitstaff were very new, and needed to look at notes when they were asked questions, but they are new and so I don't blame them. I'd rather them know rather than guess!!     Plenty of TVs to watch, but the music will drown any sound out!  Fantastic experience and I plan on coming back MANY, many times!!  Also, this place had no desserts. So you will have to fill your sweet tooth some place else.",

I've heard only good things about this place so I made a special trip out here to scope it out.   We dropped in on a Saturday night with a packed house. After giving our names to the hostess, we proceeded to the bar for some real decent cocktails. I had the \"Bakersfield Sour\", which appealed to me by means of the Buffalo Trace bourbon. Could've been a fluke thing that night, but it was indeed a stiff drink- and I like!  After being seated, I guess I was a little thrown by the limited menu. The street tacos are clearly the staple here. As such, that's what we all ordered. After assuming that was go-to, the variety of tacos is pretty vast and you will absolutely find something you like. I had the fish, mole, and hongos. They were all fantastic. Great flavors.  Prices were modest to a little higher than average. Very upscale decor, well decorated. Although crowded, service was still top notch.",

Most important - Drinks: I had both the Bakersfield Margarita and the Premium Margarita. I didn't find either of them to be amazing but I definitely liked the Bakersfield more than the Premium. The Bakersfield was too bitter and the Premium was too acidic (heart burn at second sip). However, neither of the two were \"weak\", if you know what i mean.   Food: Started off with the Chips and Queso...added the jalapenos, amazing. They have special house made sauces that elevates just about everything to perfection - Well done! The fish taco was really good. It wasn't mushy, it was crispy but i found the soft mini taco to not hold well. The short rib taco was really good and flavorful.   Location: The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing, the rustic modern works. I do also appreciate the layout, it works. I also really like the added touch of the two lean up tables behind the bar for those waiting for a table as we did (25 mins on a Tuesday evening, can't imagine a weekend).

Nearly every spot at the bar has coat/ purse hooks AND individual outlets (woot woot!). There are benches at the front of the restaurant for groups and booths on both sides of the bar.  Drinks: I highly recommend starting with the house margarita. It's the perfect combo of tart, sweet, and salty. And it's served in a mason jar.  Food: The queso is very good. We've gotten it plain each time, but I'm trying it with beans and/or chorizo on my next visit. The tostadas are larger than I was expecting and flavorful, but kind of awkward to eat. If you're on a first date and trying to look cute while eating, they probably aren't the way to go. The tacos are also delish. We've had the mole, rojo, fish, short rib, and cochinitas. The fish was the only one we didn't love. It was a tad too frozen fish sticky for my taste.  Service: They're attentive, friendly, and go above and beyond to make you happy. I've only been a few times, but our previous servers have recognized me on each of our visits and stopped by to say hi.  Reservations: Make 'em now! If you don't have a res, they'll call you when your table is ready.  Hopes & dreams: I hope they put the game on those awesome TVs on game days. It'd be a great spot for football watching. Also, I'd love to see them expand to weekend brunch service (pretty please??).",

Their chips are good too.   The inside is really nice, there are garage doors that roll up, so will be really nice this spring! Great bar set up too. Drinks looked good, but we didn't try any. One note, it is really loud. They could turn the music down a notch. (We are younger with no kids and thought it was loud).   The only other minus is the parking set up. Very hard to find a spot and the spaces that were open specifically said they were not for Bakersfield parking. Hopefully they can get that worked out! We will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "This place could easily end up being 5 stars once they work kinks out.  Newly opened and completely slammed, but still pulling it off.  Great job guys.  There were a couple little hiccups, but all were quickly noticed by staff, no need for me to mention them.  I don't frequent the northeast much, so I've never been to one of these before.  With the garage doors open and the breeze strolling through this wonderful new bar, I think I've found my new spot to hangout in Dilworth.  Westerns on the TV, Johnny Cash playing loudly, and a $28 pitcher of a very drinkable margarita.  I'm in.  I just went for some guac and tacos.  The guacamole came out chunky and delicious.  Both salsas put the chips and guac over the top.  Then the tacos, oh how I love tacos.  The mole was superb.  Not necessarily traditional,  in the mole recipe or with the pickled onion, but it just worked.  By far my favorite.  The cochinita ended up coming in second, as it had great flavor, but just wasn't quite a complex in flavors.  While I love braised short ribs, that taco needs something else as well.  Maybe more white onion, or thicker slices of radish.  All I tasted was short rib.  The crispy mahi wasn't that crispy, and also didn't seem super fresh.  Says the guy who bought fish on a Monday.  Bourdain wouldn't do it, why should I?  All in all, its a trendy taco spot and southwestern style saloon that actually pulls it off instead of being cheesy.  I'm not saying the tacos are the best in Charlotte, but they are up there.  Being able to get full for a reasonable amount of cash in that part of town isn't the easiest to come by.  There beers are a little high, but they have a PBR special.  I'll be back soon and hope to notch this up one star.",

Parking is pretty scarce here, so valet is the way to go.",

    "text": "I stopped here on a stormy Tuesday thinking it might be less busy and I could easily find a parking space.  Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space   I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.  Thankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one.  Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.    The bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.    The food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.  I went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.  The tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.  Service is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check. Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes.  So if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking, perhaps you would enjoy this one. But honestly, my other choice when i chose to stop here was Moe's down the street. After spending some time at Bakersfield, I wish I would have chose Moe's.    This place seems to be popular with some of the locals but if you check their website, it appears they are yet another chain with their other locations in the midwest.  In order to survive here they need to be open to people over 40, improve their bar service and make their restaurant a destination where people will walk for  blocks to get there.  I cannot see myself coming back here until something changes.",

We stopped by this past weekend and tried all of their tacos and margaritas. I have to say the margaritas were on point!!! The tacos were just okay. The tacos would be a lot better if the tacos shells were more authentic. The shells were under cooked and tasted like cream of wheat. Hopefully they will change their taco shells. Stay tune....",

The queso was amazing.  The guacamole was chunky and had just the right about if kick.  Great that they refilled our chips since we still had a lot of toppings left when the chips first ran out.  I ordered the spicy margarita and it was perfect.  Loved that it is served in a mason jar and the jalapeno's give it a great kick.    PBR's for $2 are served in cute boot glasses.  Ordered the fish taco and the hongos.  Both were really good.  But hands down the fish tacos were the winners of the night.  The place had a cool relaxed vibe, will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Interesting addition to East Blvd!  Hopefully it helps bring back some life to the area. The atmosphere is great, super casual but packed and lively. Everyone is here to have a good time.   The bar tables are ridiculous. The concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base, so you cannot sit under the table at all. You have to sit sideways at the table.  If I had waited an hour and a half to get that table, I would be pissed.  Fortunately, we were sat at a hightop near the bar with regular seats.  Other than the grotesquely under-estimated wait time, the service was really good.  The tacos were interesting, but out of the four we tried I'm not sure I would eat any of them again. For me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.  The cheese dip is not your standard Mexican fare.  It has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will get stringy and hard and cold.  The potato tostada was fantastic! Served in a cold iron skillet, with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad, it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells. Separated by beans and crispy potato cubes, it has a great balance of flavor and texture. The green sauce on the table adds a lot to it.    Definitely a good addition to the restaurant/bar scene.",

From the mason jars, the wooden walls, opened garage doors to let in that beautiful 72 degree weather and a John Wayne movie in the background.  *Food wise: I highly recommend the pastor and short rib! Whatever fish they used for the tacos tasted kinda cheap. Their guacamole had lots of lime in it and was way too chunky (looked like they half-assed putting it together... a little cilantro, maybe?)  *Service: Slow. It took forever to order and get our waitress' attention. I asked for a water AND a coke right away but she gave me the water halfway through my food. It also took forever to get the check after! It was already 9pm and I was suppose to leave to drive back to Atlanta after dinner.  I'll give this place another shot since according to my friends, it's the new hotspot.

Although the chips and salsa (red and green) are delicious, I hate that they charge $4 vs it being complimentary like most other joints. The guacamole and queso are also both pretty good. My husband likes the beef tostada and I am a big fan of the Loretta salad (sub romaine or mixed greens for the arugula and add grilled chicken). The tacos are a good size as well but you have to order rice and beans separately as sides.   Margaritas are very sour but I like that they can be ordered solo or in a pitcher to share. I recommend ordering the red sangria if that's your vibe!  No sports on the TV's- only old Western films so don't try to watch a game here!   Overall, I think Bakersfield is pretty consistent but they do charge for everything a la carte, so your bill does add up very quickly!",

Plus, I love Mexican food like I love my boyfriend's pet cat - it's all I think about.  My experience here started strong. Service was great and the place was quiet around noon on a Sunday. One let-down was that it was about 67 degrees outside and those nice, airy windows out front were not open - the boyfriend and I specifically picked Bakersfield because we thought we'd be able to feel like we were sitting outside on such a gorgeous day. Alas, the atmosphere here is still pretty great - the bar, especially, is really beautiful.   Our waitress was awesome - very friendly and knowledgeable. She brought over the chips trio - tortilla chips, salsa, verde salsa, and guac. The chips were warm and the dips were fresh. It was an absolutely delicious way to start the meal.  I behaved myself and stuck to water for a beverage, so I can't speak on their margaritas, although I definitely have plans to try one at some point.   Now - the tacos. I wanted to love the tacos, I really did - especially considering that they're about $4 each. These tacos are TINY for $4. You get one corn tortilla for each taco, and the tortilla was a little dried out for my taste. The meat wasn't much better - I got a carnitas taco and a beef one that I can't remember the exact name of. I liked the beef one better, but neither were great.   Next time I'm planning to try the carnitas taquitos since I wasn't terribly impressed by the tacos. I'll give Bakersfield another shot, but I certainly won't hurry back.",

They don't have frozen margaritas which I find disappointing. The tacos are yummy and the salads are ok (grilled chicken on the salads is rubbery and unappetizing).  They also don't have a parking lot, so I typically Uber when coming here.   This place is well decorated and it's a cool place to hang out - perfect for a happy hour with friends, girls night out, or fun date night!",

    "text": "I am not sure why this place has such good reviews, as I found the food to be marginal at best. Okay, okay, I have very high taco standards because I grew up in Southern California, but this is yet another bland, tasteless, and whitewashed Charlotte restaurant pretending to have \"authentic\" Mexican food.   Why Bakersfield is even named Bakersfield is something I find puzzling. In case you don't know (and why should you?), Bakersfield is a trashy town about two hours north of LA. It's very boring and downmarket, not unlike the food I ate here!   The cocktails are basically all tequila-based. I'm unfortunately sensitive to tequila, so I had to get something off their (pretty good) beer list. We started with queso, which was simultaneously lumpy yet thin. Even the chips tasted a little off.   For my main course, I had cochinita pibil, al pastor, and huitlacoche tacos. The pibil had an incredibly hot sauce...now, I love spicy, but this was hot for the sake of hot and just dominated everything else with tasteless heat. The al pastor was a little better, but not great. Finally, the huitlacoche had almost zero flavor to it. Huitlacoche is usually very good and delicate. Here, it tasted like ashes.   There was also some very inattentive service here. Apparently our waiter got sick or something and had to leave early. That's not a problem, but completely dropping the ball with the replacement server is.   I have no desire to return here. In fact, the real Bakersfield in California might be more appealing because I'm sure cheap tacos out there would taste better than these did.",

She came to take our entree order after we finished the appetizer. That was annoying, because it was 9pm by then.   I got 2 tacos; Barbacoa and Shrimp. The food was cold when it was brought out. The shrimp taco was good, but I couldn't eat the Barbacoa. Also, I ordered sour cream and salsa with the tacos. I never got it, but I was charged for it.

The pineapple is so sweet and mixes well with the pork. Other tacos pollo rojo (tasted more like ropa vieja), bistec was good and tender but lacking a bit of flavor but easily fixed with the green salsa they place on the table which is delicious.  The atmosphere was great inside. They were lacking on wait staff though we waited almost 25 minutes waiting for our check to come to the table. But other than that, it's a place to check out.",

We walked in and found seats at the bar almost immediately, sat down and our server cleaned off our place. We started out with the house margarita and a beer, and decided to start off with Chips and Guac. I'm new to guacamole, probably within the past year or so, but if I had had this when I disliked it, it probably would've turned me. A little bit of kick to it? Yes please.  The lady and I both ordered 2 tacos, she got the fish tacos and the poblano one, and I got the pollo rojo and the short rib. Although small, these were great! Well crafted, very flavorful! You can tell that they get all their ingredients fresh (which they confirmed for us). Everything down to the sour mix for the margaritas is homemade. Really impressive.   We asked for our check and told our server that it was our first time here and we'd definitely be coming back. He returned with the check and told us \"The chips and guac are on me, thanks for coming out and seeing us!\" Shoutout to our server, Buck, for making a memorable Tuesday night. We WILL be back because of him, but for the food and atmosphere too.",

Best bet is to valet across the way.  They definitely need to figure out the parking situation because I would imagine it deters people from dining there.  We were here on a cold Monday night and it was still pretty packed so they will hopefully figure out a way to accommodate their customers.  The service was so-so.  Our waitress wasn't able to really recommend anything because she doesn't eat corn so therefore had not tried any of the tacos.  That was a little annoying but it happens.  She was just a little bla for this hyped up restaurant but again, it happens.  We ordered the guacamole and I found it to be wonderful!  It was chunky, great flavor and consistency.  My only complaint is that it was too small of a portion!  4 of us wolfed that thing down in minutes.  Can I also just say I hate that they don't just offer free chips and salsa?  Why?  Seriously why not?  They do put two bottles of salsa on the table for you to add to your tacos so we basically ate the whole bottle by dumping the salsa on chips.  Yay us!!  We figured out a way to have free chips and salsa! ha! The avocado green salsa was very very good!!  The other one was smoky and hot and just so-so.    We all ordered tacos and I thought they were pretty decent!  The chicken on the chicken roja was tender and full of flavor.  It was nicely complimented by the cilantro cream sauce and queso.  It all blended quite well.  We all enjoyed our tacos very much.  The wine we had was okay--not a great selection but I'm sure that isn't what they are known for.  It was my sister's birthday and they offered a free shot of tequila which was pretty funny.  No dessert menu which I hate because I need dessert at all times.  Quick fix?  Head to Menchies down the street.  I'm sure they appreciate the business!    Overall I like this place.  I think it has a great vibe, decent food, so-so service and terrible parking.

    "text": "I'm actually updating my review I left a couple of months ago after a previous bad experience. Their owner, Brain, heard about my bad experience and sent me a gift card on the house to try Bakersfield again. Boy am I glad I did!  My husband and I went their on a Friday night for dinner and there was a hour wait. We didn't mind so we sat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a Bakersfield margarita and my husband got a seasonal draft. In addition, we started with the queso/chips and added the chorizo! Man was it good! It came hot on a iron skillet and was out within 5 minutes of ordering. The queso was very different from your typical mexican restaurant (more rich tasting), but it was delightful. Our bartenders were very nice and were constantly filling our waters and making sure our drinks were full.  Once we got seated we decided to do the whole shabang and order 1 of each taco. My favorite was the short-rib and my husband loved the pork belly. The tacos are tapas size, but they were loaded with toppings. My least favorite was the fish. Note to self- 2-3 tacos is ENOUGH lol :-)  Overall, we had a good experience at Bakersfield and I'm glad I gave it a second try. This was my husbands first time and he really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend coming here again for date night or as a nice pre-game place with a group of friends for some drinks and tacos!  PREVIOUS REVIEW: I was really excited to try Bakersfield because my Columbus, Ohio friends raved about it, however I left disappointed. I came here for lunch on a Friday with about 6 coworkers. Please keep in mind the restaurant was not busy. Anyways, our server took about 15 minutes to even come over and greet up. After we ordered our drinks, we had to ask 2 times for him to bring out oranges with our beer.   The chips and salsa were also not complimentary which always amazes me at 'Mexican' restaurants. Or our server just lied to us because every other table around us had chips. Who knows! Anyways, we all ordered various tacos. Once they arrived, nearly 30/45 minutes later, they all came together on one giant plate which was fine, but the server had no idea which tacos were what. So we had to magically guess which one. I still think I got the wrongs tacos, but they were tasty. They are very small so if your hungry this might not be a good pick for you.   After we were finished our waiter seemed to disappear. Not even the other waiters could find him. Meanwhile the tables next to us cleared. Finally we found our mysterious waiter and when he brought us the checks they were all wrong. We asked him to revise them and he brought them back wrong again. Then the THIRD time. Yes THIRD time they were wrong again! Seriously dude. We were at lunch for 2 hours for 1 beer and 2 tacos. A little ridiculous.   I only gave this place a 3 because the food was good, however the service was horrible. The environment of Bakersfield is cool and I've heard nothing but good things.   I would like to give it another try however my first impression was not a positive one.",

The queso isn't the typical white melty goodness you'd expect from a typical mexican place.  It comes out in a iron plate with a solid layer on the top.  I personally didn't like the queso, but everyone else did.  It's definitely a personal preference thing.  I got two tacos, Pork Belly and Short Rib.  Both were really good and you actually get a good amount of meat per taco.  The drinks were good as well.  I will definitely go back again soon.",

This may be \"the one.\"  Sadly this corner spot on Kenilworth and East Blvd has been occupied by many bars... and for some reason they seem to go away... maybe it's the parking situation?  Or something else, but I hope Bakersfield is here to stay for a while.  I love the space... lots to look at from the interesting wood textures and industrial looking light figures.  The HUGE windows that they can open up to the street and really have a great vibe going on inside.  The bar itself occupies the whole middle space of the restaurant and whiskey - though I have not partaken in any yet (I'm still sold on the margaritas) occupies some nice shelf/display space behind the bar.  There are booths and tables... some tables consist of some unique barrels which is a plus.  Definitely adds to the \"western\" (loosely using the term here) theme.  There are TV's here, but they don't play sports... they play old westerns.  Which is definitely different.  Probably the best part of the place (aside from the alcohol) is the food.  Tacos!  They are not your typical taco place, but the food they make here is very yummy - and pretty to look at.  My favorite is the short rib.  Combine that with some margaritas, and you got a great night ahead of  you.  Oh- did I mention that the bar has an old school juicer (handle and all) so they use fresh squeezed limes to make the margaritas!  So good.  Sometimes I do feel for the juicer guy... people (like me) order pitcher upon pitcher and he just keeps squeezing away.  At least he won't have to go to crossfit in the mornings after my friends and I visit. ;)",

The space is well decorated with a vintage western vibe - garage door windows, antiques light fixtures, and distressed wood textures.  Started with the queso loaded with jalapenos, beans and chorizos to start. It was delicious. Beautiful, indulgent, cheesy deliciousness. Maybe the best queso I've ever had.  Side note: $2 PBRs everyday in a glass boot - if that's your kind of thing.  Ordered the mole and raja tacos. Enjoyed both, but they were a little smaller and not as stuffed as I had expected? Maybe they're bigger for dinner? I also enjoyed the few bites I had of the chicken chorizo tostada and will likely order that if I return.  Maybe not the \"authentic Mexican street fare\" like they claim, but if anything, go for the queso!",

We'd gone in search of tacos and had read Bakersfield was among the best. We vehemently disagree. No to the queso, which was thick in a bad way & seasoned strangely; no to the tacos; even no to the sweet tea that tasted off and was returned. Returning is something we won't be.",

    "text": "Interesting little spot with good margaritas. Hipster Heaven.  Cool interior and a a cool crowd. They do margaritas by the pitcher or individually in mason jars - I give them a B+  We walked down to try it because a friend had been to the one in Cincinnati and really liked it. My first impression was that it was way too crowded for the amount of space inside and extremely loud. It has picnic tables, barrel tables and some cute booths. I liked the garage style doors that open to the street - that was my favorite feature.  The specialty drinks were few - i usually have to try specialty cocktails wherever I go, but both of the choices on the menu were heavy duty liquor.. so i skipped that. I can't handle bourbon or whiskey... :-/  We had to wait about an hour at one of their standing bars and we had some chips and guac. The guac was pretty fresh - I give that an A - the one item I give an A+ is the cheese with Chorizo - that was awesome!  They serve tacos A la carte and that seems to be what their \"thing\" is - the tacos are mock street-style (I say mock because they don't taste anything like street tacos, but then again, i am from Los Angeles... so take that with a sprig of cilantro) They weren't bad - they just weren't really authentic in any way. I had a few different kinds... just to be sure :)   I wasn't really happy with the wait considering how long it took them to re-seat empty tables and to wait on tables that were already seated - and they have a large empty area near the front door/bar that could accommodate about 3 or 4, 2 tops.. that could have alleviated some of the back up of people mashed together in the walk areas.  The server we finally got when we were seated was extremely MEH - we joked with her and she acted like we were annoying her by being silly or humorous. Maybe she was just tired... but hey - so were we after standing for an hour - waiting for a table.  I might be back.. not sure...",

    "text": "Neither food nor service are impressive, hopefully the drinks will keep this place alive until Spring.   I dropped in Saturday as tacos sounded a great idea on the last of the warm fall days. When I sat at the bar & caught up with a friend for 5 to 10 minutes, it took the bartender asking to refill my friends' drinks for her to come over and even then I had to get her attention myself to get a menu or water.  Perusing the menu was as disappointing. No entrees, chips & salsa are $3. Within 3 blocks is Moe's & Tijuana Flats. I get that Bakersfield's chips & salsa are made daily but do you really decide where to eat based exclusively on this side item? Tacos are $4 each and they're small. They are tasty, but flour tortillas aren't available, tacos are served on white corn tortillas only.   My friends had the short rib sandwich earlier and remarked it was good but a lot of bread. I ordered 3 tacos, one pastor and each style of chicken. They came out in a timely fashion and the pastor is a good example balanced with fresh pineapple. I couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken styles. Still peckish, I had the veggie tortilla of fried potatoes, black beans, guac and lettuce. It's quite a treat!  I like the decor, the roll up doors and naked lights are a relaxed vibe. While I again waited for the bartender's attention to get my check, I noticed the bar back squeezing lemons for their margaritas. Since my friends stayed and had a pitcher they must be pretty good. It seems like a great place to drink which isn't my thing.   Given the lack of parking, other places with equally good pastor tacos at better prices (la unica on central) and no reservations you could very well hunt for parking, find it, and have an hour wait. **The manager sent a yelp compliment and clarified they have more valet spots than those at Berrybrook up to 40 spots total** Still I hope the owners have the cash to survive until spring when margaritas or beers with a gentle breeze blowing in off East Blvd is a great idea.",

Went today and had terrible customer service from waitress named Danielle. Tossed plates on the table, never brought refills, added 2 extra tacos to our tab that we didn't get or ask for but by the time she brought the check we just wanted to get out of there so I paid the extra 8 dollars to leave. Please tell me this isn't the new norm here bc I love this place!!  ****update since review, just hours ago! The owner has already contacted me to make it right! I knew this place had a great soul along with its amazing food! Thank you Brian!! I'll be back this week!!!",

We got the queso which came with chips and salsa which I was really appreciative about, because I'm not typically a fan of places that don't give you free chips and salsa.  The fact that they included chips and salsa in the queso price made it worth it.  The queso was a little different, I had mixed feelings about it.  It was kind of good, and kind of like when your friend attempts to make something and asks if you like it and you're obligated to say yes.  Not loving it, I would probably return and get it again, just because.  The chips and salsa were really good, I wish they were a little bit more spicy, but I guess that's what the $1 jalapenos (kind of ridiculous) are for.  The green salsa was my favorite, the red salsa was a little too smokey for my liking.  The bistec and the braised pork tacos were really good, the fish and rojo tacos were not so good.  The service was extremely fast when I went here and our server was very informative and nice which definitely got my rating to 3 stars.",

    "text": "We were definitely excited about a new Mexican-type restaurant opening up, so we checked out Bakersfield on a Saturday.  This place is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, so we were a little bit disappointed.  Think of it as a Mexican themed All American Pub. (in terms of atmosphere and crowd)  It was pretty loud and crowded by 7pm.  We waited 45 mins for a table, and then we were finally seated at a picnic table with some strangers. I hate eating at community seating when I go out to eat.  It just makes me think the restaurant is cheap and trying to cram as many humans into a sardine can as possible. When you eat at a picnic table you don't really ever settle in and enjoy yourself, either.  In terms of food and drink, the margaritas were good and the tacos we ordered were very good. The short rib one was probably the best, but the rest were serviceable. One nice thing is that you can order them a la carte, so you can try the different ones out. Unfortunately, they charge you for chips and salsa, which rubs me the wrong way as well.  They aren't even good or special.    I may go back here for some drinks and to sit at the bar, but never again for eating.  The value is in the margaritas, not the overpriced food you get to experience at a picnic table with strangers, while people slam into you as they shuffle around the bar.",

The cheese dip was excellent. Chips were fresh. Tacos were good. I don't do meat so I only had the fish and shrimp. But those were excellent. And the best park. Service was excellent. My cute waitress was just so nice I couldn't have asked for a better experience.   Perfect score right across the board. You must try this place. The atmosphere was also dope. Looks to be a popular afterwork spot and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Literally nothing to complain about. Will be back",

Typical Charlotte parking frustrations though....  Anyways when you walk in the decor is very modern and the lighting in there is very dim. The noise level is pretty high with people and music playing. Definitely might have to scream a little at whoever is at your table to have a convo.  The review doesn't seem like it's going for 4 stars at all.. but the service and food was really good against the latter. They have really unique and cool flavors of tacos, as well as tostadas, salads to name a few.  We got the regular queso and chips as an appetizer. It was amazing! The flavor profiles in the queso is something different that I have never tasted before. It was a good consistency of thick and creamy. Baked on the top. I highly recommend.   My favorite taco of all of the ones I tried was the Al Pastor taco. Simple I know .. but I loved that is had pineapple on it to compliment the savory. All the meat on each taco I had in general was flavored and marinated really good. I also appreciate the handmade tortillas made it feel authentic.   I definitely recommend just beware of parking restraints.",

You can join the waitlist ahead of time by calling, which I recommend doing. We called ahead and still ended up waiting double what they told us it would be. There's a standing room area by the car that has full service, but we chose to wait for a table. It's crazy loud inside, we could barely carry on a convo. There's street parking available that I saw, but you can't use the garage.   Their drink menu is expansive, they have more drink options than food options. I ordered a margarita and it was very tart. Not the best I've ever had. We got guacamole and chips for the table which were very salty and the guacamole was just okay. We all ordered tacos, and they bring them out on a pizza tray and stand. I got the shrimp and pork tacos. They were very limey and a bit spicy.   The service was amazing though, all the servers were so sweet! They definitely work for their tips. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't go back here as I was underwhelmed. Didn't live up to the hype for me!",

    "text": "If you love tacos and the South End, this is your spot. The atmosphere is awesome and has tons of character. I'm with you, the name Bakersfield sounds more like a brunch spot than a taco joint, but it's themed after Bakersfield, CA where boys like Johnny Cash hailed from. Cool vibe.   Food was solid. The Bistec taco was out of this world. I had one and ordered more. The flavor on the steak is probably the best steak taco I've ever had. I also tried the shrimp taco, I believe it was Baja Shrimp. It was good, but had way too much cabbage. Pulled half of it of. Also has some kind of red peppers on the top. Next time I'd probably opt for less cabbage and more of those.   We started with margaritas and queso. The queso is different. It's made locally and has a somewhat cripy layer on the top. Think baked cheese. They don't give out salsa, it's $1 more, but what are chips without salsa. My friend liked it, but I wasn't a fan. It has a somewhat Smokey taste, almost like it has bbq sauce in it. Probably a personal preference thing if you like it or not.   The margaritas were good and have house made mix. Always a fan of that. They don't seem sweet, but I barely made my way through the second one. Would definitely try other flavors. I just went with the house.   Parking is tough, but luckily I read the tip from the manager and parked diagonally across the street. They also have valet. Otherwise, be prepared to search, walk or Uber.   Will definitely be back!!",

The pineapple margarita is my favorite. For $1 more, you can choose to make any of the drinks spicy. They add jalapenos and a spicy red pepper to them. I would say to try it at least once, although the dollar addition is a little silly if you ask me. I used my peppers over in my second drink and they were just as good.  I'm not a fan of corn tortillas, so I just eat the insides of the tacos. I like the pork one the best. I really love the guacamole. It is some of the best I've ever had!!! I prefer it 100 % over the queso. I would recommend to get the guac over paying for the chips and salsa. It is way better and you'll be happy you did.   Park at Berrybrook Farms on Sundays! They are closed and it's a very close option for parking.",

    "text": "Bakersfield is definitely a popular spot, sometimes it can be tough to get a table--but if you're up for sitting at the bar your chances are pretty good. I love the high ceilings and low lighting inside, the bar is large and really pretty.  The food is great. Do yourself a favor and order \"The Trio\" which is chips with guac, rojo and verde salsas. The verde salsa is unreal, I usually ask for a side of it with anything I order off the menu. I'm a fan of the guacamole because you can tell it's fresh--there are big chunks of avocado in it and the seasoning is perfect.   The food is all priced well and you can get a deal with a couple of tacos. My favorites are the fish taco and the huitlacohe taco (corn truffle, roasted poblano, corn, onion, cotija cheese and cilantro). The tortillas are house made and you can taste the difference.  Great selection of local beers and awesome cocktails.",

    "text": "I like Bakersfield for the atmosphere.  It's a chill place with fun pub seating and awesome rollup doors that make it especially awesome in the warmer months.  It can, however, be very loud; making it difficult to hold any type of real dinner conversation.  That paired with the fact that there is virtually no parking prompts my 4 star rating vs a full 5.  The menu is a modern twist on some more authentic Mexican options.  The taco selections are great, but they are small.  Flour tortillas are not an option, as they only offer corn tortillas.  The salsas are great, the margaritas pack a punch, and the taquitos are amazing.  I've yet to personally try the Milanesa, but a friend of mine swears by it and says its very authentic.  The Paloma cocktail is my favorite.    It's a great place to hang with friends and knock back a few drinks.  They keep late hours, and it's an ideal place before or after a concert, party, or night on the town.  I'd definitely suggest taking an Uber for that reason, and due to the aforementioned lack of parking.  Don't be fooled by the smaller portions either.  It's very filling.  Taco up and eat on!",

It's really chill but not a hole in the wall.   I went on a Friday afternoon. I'm not the biggest fan of their tacos but decided to start with one shrimp taco and shared a pitcher of margarita. The shrimp taco was so good, I ordered another one. I had the short rib taco before but couldn't remember what I thought of it. I ordered it just to try it again. I wish I would have ordered another shrimp taco. The short rib taco wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Never had an issue with service and service again was great!   My only gripe is trying to park when they don't have valet available. There are \"no  bakersfield\" parking signs everywhere and there aren't a lot of places nearby where you can park without risking it.   Would I go back? Absolutely. Whether it's for the shot of the day, jalapeno margarita, fish tacos or chill vibe, I'm always down to go.",

Good location and nice for people watch, attracts a diverse crowd. Parking is difficult. (be aware).  This is not a place for quick bites, expect to spend some time here.

The windows to the street were open and a cool breeze complemented our delicious meal. We started with the chips and salsa which were delicious. It comes with a red and green salsa, the red one is mildly spicy. The real superstar here are the House made tortilla chips which are so, so good. I ordered the cochinita pibil and fish tacos. The cochinita was to die for! Perfectly cooked pork and a wonderful combination of flavors. Just a hint of spiciness (I like it HOT!). I wish I had ordered all of this kind. The fish taco left a lot to be desired. The flavor wasn't amazing and it just tasted bland.   We ordered the cheese quesadilla for the kids and I have to admit that I had to restrain myself from finishing off her quesadilla. The cheese and tortilla they use are scrumptious. These items filled me up and were pretty cheap considering how full I felt and that I had left overs (kids food). Can't wait to visit again! The service was excellent!",

We both handpicked the Baja Shrimp Tacos as our favorite, even though we enjoyed the chicken taqueria, carnitas tacos, and the steak tacos.   Now, service wise... zero stars.  I specifically asked for \"Patron\" strawberry margarita. I watched the bartender make my drink with a Reposado. I was extremely disappointed. Speaking from someone working in a bar industry, it's a plus if a customer wants their drink made with a higher brand. And I did not mind paying the extra price for the higher brand. But this bartender, did not make my drink correctly. My friend then ordered herself her Patron with Pineapple juice. She too noticed him opening up a 1800 silver bottle. After bringing it out, we double checked with the bartender, asking if he did make it with patron, but he insisted he did. And with that kind of confidence, how could we imply for another round? This was our last night before leaving Charlotte. This experience left us with a sour taste in our mouths.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating features...  Dora here. So, it's Superbowl Sunday and hubby decides he wants to go to Mert's. Mert's, right in the heart of downtown Charlotte! Granted, the Superbowl wasn't being played in Charlotte, but the downtown area was a hub of activity with local restaurants/bars offering special activities/prices for the event. Good thing I had a backup planned. After circling a few times and not finding a parking spot, we diverted to...  Bakersfield Tacos on East Blvd in the Dilworth neighborhood of Charlotte.   Dora here. Where we still ran into a parking dilemma. No private lot, not a street parking space for blocks, and plenty of signage nearby stating \"NO BAKERSFIELD.\" But, thankfully, only on Sundays, Berrybrook Farm allows Bakersfield patrons to park free in their lot. The server told us they have valet parking at night.  A local place serving up their own version of Mexican cuisine, Bakersfield offers both full size plates and petite tacos.   For our appetizer, we chose the Chips and Queso and added Chorizo. This queso was great, thick, gooey and with a little smoky flavor, but the star of this dish was the fried chorizo. Combined with the queso, it was the perfect match for the salty but hardy chips.  Dora here. The first thing that hit me about this was the smell. Amaaaazing! Cheesy, deep flavor, delicious! I could've made this a whole meal. I couldn't scoop this up fast enough! :)  For my lunch, I chose four different tacos: Fish, Pork Belly Pastor, Bistec, and Short Rib all served on in-house handmade tortillas.   The fish taco featured Mahi, lime sauce, citrus slaw, and cilantro. A great tasting taco with crispy fish and a crunch from the citrus slaw.   The pork belly pastor included chili marinated pork, pineapple, onion and cilantro. A sweet tasting taco that I just couldn't get enough of.   The short rib was my favorite. Tender braised short rib, queso fresco, crema (like sour cream), onion, radish, and cilantro combined for a perfect taco.   The Bistec, marinated short rib with a spicy chipotle slaw, had me reaching for my drink after every bite.  Dora here. I sampled a bite of all the tacos. Yowza! What an explosion of flavors! Since I'm not typically a huge fan of fish or pork, I was surprised at my top two faves: Pork Belly Pastor and Fish. By the time I made it to my Milanesa Torta, my mouth was on fire! In a good way. :)  Check out that tender white chicken breast! Mmmm. And I loved the fresh bread, a Telera Roll, \"similar to a French roll with a scored and flour-dusted crust.\"   Intense flavors as well, with a bold blend of black beans, salsa verde, avocado and lemon mayo, but I would've preferred half the pesto.  Eventually, we'll make it to Mert's. :)  What about you? How do you like your tacos?  Dora rated this restaurant a 4, but I rate it a 5. Since that equates to 4 1/2, we'll give them 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "I drive past this restaurant all the time and have been wanting to try it since I moved to Charlotte back in August. When we arrived I was struck by the cool ambiance and awesome bar area, but was somewhat disappointed with my actual meal. The chips and salsa were delicious and a definite must. Be sure to load up on the salsa verde which was so fresh and flavorful. I wish I could say the same for the two tacos I ordered, however. Feeling surf and turf, I decided to order the fried shrimp and steak tacos. While the shrimp taco was just alright, the steak taco was fairly underwhelming. The meat was very chewy and bland. I was hoping for some kind of a fresh cilantro marinated or chimichurri type dressing but what I got was steak that'd been doused in some kind of BBQ sauce that didn't seem to go very well with the rest of the ingredients in the taco. Overall presentation of the dish was beautiful but sadly did not meet my expectations given the delicious apps and overall atmosphere. I'd be willing to give it another try, but maybe just for happy hour and apps.",

The tacos were fine but small, as they tell you when you order. They are designed for you to try more than one.   If anyone in your party is gluten sensitive, they will be very very limited on what they can eat. Most of their food is braised fried or breaded. The quacamole was fine but nothing special. The margaritas were the same, nothing to write home about.",

The food and drinks were just average and I think the reason why people define this place as a date night spot is because of cramped space, dim lighting and loud music. None of them is a criteria for my date night spot and  that's part of the reason why I was disappointed. Top it all, food was expensive ($4/taco). Nothing this place offers puts a big smile on my face and thus 2 stars.",

I loved the warm chips and I think I made a mistake by not leaving enough room for my entree. Most of our table ordered tacos and they came out on a large tray which was very confusing. All of the food I tried was tasty and flavorful. Will definitely be back for a date night after skipping lunch so I can try more items on the menu.

    "text": "If it's yummy Mexican food you are in the mood for - this ain't your place. But if you want a cool spot to drink and enjoy small-ish plates with, then I recommend Bakersfield. Let me break this down:  Parking - I was meeting some friends there and because I read on Yelp that parking was crazy, I got there a little bit early. I easily found a spot on the street (as did one of my friends). However, another one of my friends had a harder time finding parking. I think management is going to have to figure something out with parking (especially since valet is only after 6 pm) in order to make it manageable for people to come here. I would give parking 2 stars.  Drinks - I had the sangria and really liked it. It was fruity and sweet. One of my friends had the margarita and liked it. I would give drinks 5 stars.  Queso - we had the queso with chorizo, black beans, and jalapenos. It was awesome! My one friend commented that the chorizo made it kind of salty, but I didn't eat much with chorizo so I don't know. The chips were delicious, although I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (but, again, this is NOT a normal Mexican restaurant). I give appetizer a 4.  Tostadas- I had the tostada that had potatoes on it. I can't think of much good to say. There was a massive clump of chunky guacamole. I like guac but that didn't save this dish. It was super dry and I would not recommend it. The waitress offered to get me something else, which I declined (although she still charged me for it, eventhough I didn't really eat it). I give the tostada a 1 star.  Short Rib Taco - this was delicious! I am not normally a fan of radishes but I left the sliver of radish on there and it was tasty. The tacos come on corn tortillas (which I like), so don't expect the soft texture of a flour tortilla. The only think that would have made this taco even better would have been some sort of sauce to pour on it. I give this taco 4 stars.  Overall, I like this spot. Is it my favorite place in Dilworth? No. Will I go again? Absolutely.",

The wait was almost an hour long and though I wasn't thrilled about that I was still ready to wait. Once seated we ordered chips , queso , and  salsa. They were all amazing. That's when I really started to get hype about the food. We ordered almost all the tacos on the menu and even a specialty of the night taco. That's when my experience really went downhill. The El Pastor was dry and flavorless. In fact all of them were. And the short rib the best of all of them was less than average. Which tells you how nasty the others were. I don't know how people give these tacos five star. Either the kitchen doesn't have their usual people . (Which it should considering it's a Friday night) Or people have lost their tastebuds. One thing I am impressed about is how this restaurant has lasted this long. Because I know some people couldn't have lost their tastebuds. So do yourself a favor and just go for the chips and queso. But frankly if it were me and it will be next time I'll just be at Sabor.",

The decor is nice but I wish it was a bit more bright. You know how some restaurants keep their lights a bit dim? Yeah, not a fan of that!  But the tacos, OMG! My personal favorite was the pork belly one. I really liked how it was paired with pineapple. I also enjoyed the short rib taco and the fish one as well. I would recommend trying all of them honestly. The amount of meat is generous! I think it is definitely worth the $4 dollars.   I seriously can't wait to come back here!

Once you order your food the wait isn't long at all. There's valet parking across the street so you don't have to worry about parking which I heard was a big deal at the previous restaurants at this location.",

Served in a squeeze bottle (sounds weird, but it works!), they are so flavorful and unique that you may find yourself running out by the end of the meal.  The menu is relatively small, but if you are in the mood for unique and flavorful tacos, this is a perfect spot. And since the menu is smaller, you can be assured that everything on it is the best possible quality. Try everything at least once - you won't be disappointed!",

This visit we did notice that the music was very loud that it was almost hard for the 3 of us to have s conversation. I ordered the Milanesa sandwich and loved it! After filling up on queso and guac, I ended up bringing half of the sandwich home for lunch the next day. The guys I was with ordered 3 tacos each and nearly inhaled them so I'm guessing they were delicious as well. We will definitely be back again in the near future!",

    "text": "Great addition to the vibrant Dillworth scene, this Cal-Mex (not really Tex Mex) place has a limited menu but it seems that they do that on purpose to focus in on quality. And the food is definitely quality as they make their own chips, tortillas and breads. We got a boatload of items, starting with the Queso and Chorizo with fresh tortilla chips. Great flavor but we felt it could have used more heat, so we added some of their roasted red pepper sauce. Followed that with their Short Rib Torta, which was outstanding! Super tender and fkavorful....not sure of the arugula though. Next was the Tostada with chicken. That was pretty good, nice flavor especially when adding the fresh lime they give you. Now for the tacos. I know....we're pigs...oink oink oink. Had the Chicken Mole and Pork Pastor. The pork taco was better. Being from Chicago and my buddy being from NYC our definition of Mole is FAR different than Bakersfield's. Their mole jyst didn't have the requisite \"sweet heat\" that defines mole. There was too much chocolate and it wasn't Mexican chocolate. Honestly just not a very good Mole.  Other than that this is a solid 4 star restaurant. Note that you most likely will be sitting family style with strangers....but after the meal you won't be strangers no more.",

I've had the short rib and al pastor tacos, both of which were really good and flavorful. I'll order them again, but I want to try some of the other items as well. It's never been super crowded when I've gone in (I usually don't go until 9-10pm during the week), but I can see that it would get crowded during normal dinner hours.   The atmosphere is also really cool. They play old western movies on the TVs and have a cool bar area. They do a different $3 shot each day of the week so be sure to check them out (they are listed on the wall in the back near the kitchen). Also, they serve $2 PBR drafts and they serve them in the coolest cowboy boot mugs! Chips and salsa isn't free, but worth it to share with the table! They usually offer two different salsas (a green and a red) and both are very flavorful. I'd prefer a spicier salsa, just not sure if they have one available, but I may ask next time!",

It was lightly breaded mahi piping hot with super cool and crunchy citrus slaw.  Loved it!  The Conchinita was smokin' with great heat right over the plate.  Thankfully, Budweiser was there to offer relief.   Carla, my server, was friendly and explained the menu.  Once I figure out parking, I'm coming back and with friends in tow.  Nice job!",

Tacos were BOMB and this is coming from an LA dude. I did love how our attendant wanted to verify which tequila my friend wanted and how best to make a Cadillac Margarita so there wouldn't be disappointment instead of assuming. I do wish there were a few more cider/wine options, but it's fine. I'm fine.  This is a good spot for a date or group outing. Come try it out.  Got it? Good.",

The two salsas are also delicious and you won't be able to stop eating them! The red one is spicy and the green one is unlike any other green salsa I've had. So good.   2-3 tacos and you're set! I like the short rib and the fish taco. They also have good vegetarian options.   They always have a seasonal margarita and this should not be overlooked. The Rosemary watermelon margarita in the summer was my favorite summer drink! I even tried to recreate it (to no avail). I just had their fall spiced apple margarita and it was yummy as well.   Service has always been good even when they are busy.   Parking is really my only beef. It is available but hard to find and I'm always worried I could be towed. They have valet, but I feel bad I never have cash.   They are doing so many things right, which continues to make me a customer.",

Sure, parking sucks....but they do offer valet so that's a huge plus!  Based on the previous reviews I knew I had to start with a Bakersfield Margarita....and it was totally worth it. I loved that they come in mini mason jars and come with a good amount of tasty liquor. We also ordered some queso with chorizo.....holy cheesy goodness. It's delish. This is exactly how cheese dip should be done. Get it.   For dinner I tried the short rib taco which comes with queso fresco, onions and cilatro then gets topped with a radish. It was really tasty. My friends tried the fish and pastor tacos and agreed that they were all really good!  I also tried the Chicken Chorizo Tostado which was my favorite of the event and comes with black beans, chicken chorizo, salsa, queso on a tortilla over romaine lettuce. It was a small dish really packed with some amazing flavors. Make sure not to miss out on adding a pinch of lime juice!   There's plenty more tacos I want to try and I plan to enjoy that queso again, so I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",

Love the \"smashed\" avocados with big chunks - would hit a pocket of lemon juice or hot sauce that gave it some major mojo flavor!  The decor is over the top cool! Super swanky Roadhouse!! Let me pinch myself! Am I in Austin, Texas? Or Charlotte?  Super fast servers! Free valet parking across the street!  So what's the deal? Bakersfield is actually one of five, with most based in Ohio and Indiana. Who whudda thunk it? Not me. Well, they're looking to expand. If all of them are like this, then they have a formula for success. I will need to rent a car and visit all of them!! Or maybe I'll just live in a tent on top of this one!!",

That's how much I love mexican food.   Now being in the pregnant state that I am, I have two cravings, watermelon and TACOS. And on my usual monthly night out with these homies (it was my turn to choose) I had to choose this place based on the reviews and pics.   The appetizer queso joint was good. My homie Meleah asked me what I want in it (perks of pregnancy) and I wanted all the shi*t in it. And guess what... I loved it! Chorizo is a bit salty so make sure you stir that up some.   I got 5 different tacos... don't ask me which ones. (pregnancy brain)  I just remembered that I I really didn't like the fish taco. It needed some sort of cream on it and it just seemed bland and dry.   Another taco (can't remember the meat) had too much slaw in it, so that was pretty dry as well.   Imma go back...   The service was good. How good?: I'm driving around in circles trying to find a spot to park and my homie told me where she parked so I parked behind her on Kenilworth. (don't park in the garage). Then I'm walking and walking, practically circling the building cuz I'm like \"where the sh*t is this place\". I guess the dude my friend was speaking to figured I'd be searching for the place, so he came outside to show me the restaurant is that end of the sidewalk, right across from Berrybrook Farms. That was kind, because it was hot as sh*t outside and me and my pregnant a** was about to skip out if I couldn't find the joint.   Check it out tho... Cheers!",

All the ingredients they use are super fresh and the recipe they have made for their slaw is perfect. They also make their tortillas in house. Loving the fact they have vegetarian options that can just as easily be made vegan! They also make a superb pineapple margarita and all the margaritas they make can be made spicy !!!  Service is always top notch and the atmosphere is great especially when it's warm out and the big garage style doors can be opened and you can people watch when the weather is nice. Parking can be challenging but there is a parking garage entrance kind of hidden down a few stores in the same strip building. You must check this place out it's perfect for any occasion like a night out with friends to lunch with the family to date night.",

Our group of 4 ordered the Bakersfield margarita pitcher and were all very pleased. It's about 6 glasses for $36. They fill up a mason jar 3/4 of the way with tequila and then top it off with triple sec. The only thing better than having margaritas is having chips and delicious guacamole with margaritas. Also really enjoyed the bottles of salsa they serve with the warm tortilla chips! We didn't order any tacos this time because we already had lunch plans for later on, but we plan on returning next time we visit Charlotte because they sounded delicious! My mouth waters every time I see the pictures posted by other Yelpers. Loved the atmosphere at this american style mexican restaurant.",

I suggest getting anything with short rib on it. And always, always get the queso. It's a little spicy but it will legitimately put life back into your bones. (It also makes the inconvenient parking situation completely worth it -- trust me).   The service is excellent and I've never waited too long for a table (though I usually go for a super early dinner just to beat the crowd).   Overall, you can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Wow this place was packed on a Friday night! A friend and I waited about an hour for a table for two. They really don't have much seating. Luckily you can get margaritas while you wait. I highly recommend the spicy margarita. Perfect amount of spicy and not too heavy on sour mix. Oh, and extra points for being served in a mason jar.   Post-cycle class and waiting for the table we were past hungry when we sat down and ordered chips and queso and guacamole. The queso is served in a skillet and is more melty cheese than complete liquid. Different and delicious. Guac is perfect. Oh and the green salsa on the table is to die for  I ordered one short rib taco and one pulled pork. The pulled pork was my favorite. A little spicy. The short rib was a little sweet for me. So if you don't like the sweet and spicy flavor I would get something else, but that one was my friends favorite.   Great service even though they were slammed. Our server even helped me pick out what to order for my boyfriend togo that would best reheat. We decided on the short rib torta. I'll say we made the perfect choice. I tasted a bite and it was amazing!   I got a togo order, 2 drinks, 2 tacos and split 2 apps and was surprised how low my bill was.   Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Yum! Loved this place after hearing about it for a while! The food was great. I'd love to give 5 stars for the overall experience but the service was a bit slow, and the bathrooms were out of TP and paper towels. Not the biggest deal but distinguishes a 5 star across the Board.  My husband and i split 4 tacos- the mahi, pollo rojo, pork belly and steamed bun. The pollo rojo was by farrrr my favorite. With quest fresco, white onion and a lime sauce, you can't go wrong and the chicken is shredded, so easy to eat in taco form. Everything about this taco was perfect. Next time, I'm ordering three of them. The pork belly with pineapple was also pretty amazing. The pork had a chili marinade glaze which really beefed up the flavor 10 fold. The 4 inch tortillas are homemade and very yummy! Taco prices are reasonable; $4 each and $3 for a vegetarian one. We also had the Breckinridge agave wheat beer, to help wash down the tacos. Delicious. They have a few rotating taps but most of their craft beer come on bottles/cans, but have a great selection of locals with noda, birdsong and triple C.  Unfortunately, they don't give complimentary chips and salsa like typical Mexican places.   Will definitely be back here. Love the atmosphere and the garage doors that open up the outside. Beautiful wooden central bar. Bring your peeps and enjoy the pitcher margs and some yummy tacos!",

    "text": "It's an odd day when I find a great place via a recommendation from my wife's stylist, but there you have it.   I had a hankering for some Mexican food.  Still been trying to find that one place in Charlotte that'll quench my unending cravings for tortillas and salsa. When my wife was getting her hair trimmed at Level 42, her stylist Kerri told her about Bakersfield.  Seriously tacos at Bakersfield?  The name didn't grab me, but she insisted that I'd love the food.  Ok. You had me at Mexican.    We headed over there and arrived just after it opened at 11AM.  As is our way, we headed to the bar and situated ourselves right in front of the bartender.  Kaycee was cutting limes and creating all sorts of concoctions for their various and neverending varieties of mixed drinks.  She offered us the menu and adult beverage bible which we perused.  But of course it was the beer we were looking at more so than the mixed beverages.  Their brews were unremarkable,  but just good enough to keep us plopped in our stools.  We got an IPA from Birdsong: Say it to Your Face.  Let me just say Yuck, but that's not the establishments fault.  Must have a great beer representative there.  Birdsong can and does do better...I digress.  We sipped the beers a bit and looked over the menu. Kaycee kept us entertained telling us about her travel stories and living through several of mine.  She just kept cutting those limes and setting up the bar all the while she served us and offered up some great tips for our ventures in the area.  The menu was pretty good. Lots of choices. I wanted to get the Milinesa Torta, but we decided to split a Chicken Chorizo Tostada.  At $8, I was a little skeptical.  And my skepticism was justified. You really don't get enough when you consider it's Mexican food.  Very inexpensive ingredients.  I thought there would be a bit more.  Regardless, it was very good and even splitting it with my wife hit the spot.    Although I didn't care for the beer all that much, I did partake in a 2nd.  About this time Kaycee rotated to other matters and Elenore came in and took over the challenge of keeping me smiling.  I must say Elenore is a gem.  She told us she was in Charlotte to work with the staff, but her home restaurant is in Ohio. She'd been here a month and spent most of her time working, working, working.  She also told us about her experiences, compared notes, asked us about our food and service, talked about the other restaurants in their company, and invited us back.  Never did the conversation or entertainment faulter...even when she was pressed on all sides for drinks and questions.  By far the best service I've ever had in Charlotte. Between Kaycee, Elenore, and the rest of the staff I had a blast.  The food? A bit pricey.  The Drinks? Never tried the liquor,  but the selection was crazy good. The beer was a bit weak.    All in all, it was the service I liked best here.  The staff and the atmosphere was perfect.  I'd like to come back and I likely will. Elenore is headed back to Ohio but will return March 30 through April 10.  My wife and I will return as well.  We are also excited to hear about their plans for expanding their fried chicken concepts: Yes please.  5 for service. Food is a 2.5 and the beer is a 2.  Liquor and all their mixed drink concoctions are easily a 5.  Kudos.",

The tacos were good street tacos and you can't really go wrong with any of them. I recommended looking at the specials because you can find some delicious tacos not on the main menu. The atmosphere is casual and had Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid playing on the tv. The beer and margarita selection is vast and has something for everyone. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait a bit for a table. The staff was friendly and our waitress was very nice.",

    "text": "A recent visit to Bakersfield reinforced why this is one of the best Tex-Mex joints in Charlotte, but a couple of drawbacks knocked it back from my original five-star rating. First off, this place is LOUD. And while the vibrant, lively atmosphere makes it one of the hippest restaurants in the Queen City, it's also extremely hard to carry on a conversation. Whether you're at the bar or a table, the cacophony is near-deafening, so be prepared to do a fair amount of screaming over your dinner.   Second, the margaritas we had during this last visit were less compelling than I remember, with more tart than tequila. But the meal -- from the chips & queso we started with, to the Pollo Rojo and Bistec tacos I enjoyed for my entree -- was outstanding. I'd still rate Bakersfield as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, but you may want to learn lip-reading if you plan to visit on a busy Saturday night.",

I couldn't justify $4 each for individual tacos there again after being dissapointed by the flavor.  Did not order any drinks but the drink menu seemed very overpriced, $10 for a margarita in a small Mason jar is too much.  Service was fantastic! Our waitress walked us through the menu, made recommendations on what we might like, checked on us regularly but not too much, and just overall was very kind and helpful.   I would maybe try it again in the future if I was in the area but would more likely find somewhere else to eat on that stretch of East Boulevard.",

It has a baked crust on top and less sweet, more nutty flavors. You may not enjoy it if you are expecting the typical creamy and sweet queso. The salsas on the table were just alright. I prefer more of a chunky salsa and a bolder salsa verde.   The atmosphere is warm and and trendy. The service has been great and the margs strong. I wish the menu had some kind of combo plates since the a la carte menu leaves me wanting more.   The parking is the only thing keeping Bakersfield from being a weekly spot for me. Parking is always painful and frustrating. I get a chuckle every time I see valet for this place as I don't expect or want to valet my car for a ~$15 meal.   I hope Bakersfield hangs around for a while. Would be great to see them lease out some parking spaces in the adjacent shopping center.",

Bakersfield has filled a big void in the neighborhood offering a breezy, open, intimate yet relaxing place to gather with friends for a drink.  Great ambiance and great place to catch up with friends over a few drinks or kick off the night.",

The queso and chips were pretty yummy (the top looks like a personal pan pizza with all that delicious bubbly cheese) and the short rib torta was okay. I felt a little silly, but since there was RIB in the name, I wasn't sure if there would be bones in the sandwich; there weren't, woohoo hahah. I was so stuffed that I couldn't eat the other half of my sandwich.  Parking, like everyone says, is a pain, even when the restaurant is empty (like it was today) because Bakersfield customers are prohibited from parking in the main parking deck next door. We ended up finding street parking.",

I had the Rajas Taco which was delicious along with the Papas tostadas. The corn tortillas are delicious and are made in house and the taco was great. My favorite though was the Papas tostadas it was so delightful to my taste buds to keep my food vegan I just ask them to remove the creamy cilantro sauce and cheese and topped my food with there red salsa sauce that was amazing! The only downside is the parking but other than that this is a cool spot!",

    "text": "So after heading to our usual Cabo Fish Taco, which had 20 people outside waiting to get in, I suggested we head across town to Bakersfield. Now that doesn't sound like a drive but we live just outside Mineral Springs! We used the Valet Parking which was great since there is no designated parking.We walked in and were immediately greeted by the hostess, who was extremely courteous and definitely knows how to do her job. She took my cel number, so we could get a text when there was a table ready. Off to the bar area where we found two stools. A manager came over and brought us two menus and said a server would be over in case we wanted any drinks or apps. He showed up immediately and we ordered a Corona, Spicy Jalapeno Margarita and Queso with Jalapenos. In a blink of the eye our Queso appeared...steamy hot with lightly salted Tortilla Chips. A few minutes later.. drinks! I ordered my Margarita with no salt but it came rimmed. I called our waiter over and he apologized. I said please tell the bartender not to pour it into another glass but make a fresh one. I watched and the bartender did it without pitching a fit....which lots of bartenders do. We got our text and were taken to our table by both our original and new waiters. She asked and we ordered a PAPAS TOSTADA. This was excellent...there were do many layers of flavors to this.   I had the Fish Taco and my wife had a Pollo Rojo....both were full of flavor and cooked just right. The service was great and the meal well paced. The only issue was our waitress, in addition to our table and the ones around it, had one on the other side of the restaurant. When it came time to get our check she was nowhere in site although her hair is multicolored, but appeared shortly. We'll definitely be back and recommend Bakersfield to everyone. The one funny part of the evening is we realized we were the oldest people there",

    "text": "Mexican, you have my heart wrapped up like a perfect burrito. Well Bakersfield focuses on tacos, but you catch my drift. On a hunt for Mexican Liz and I stumbled on this place, new to East Blvd. but it's actually a small chain for what I Googled. The place was packed, not too surprisingly for a Saturday night and a 30 minute wait, not bad.   The decor is cool, rustic, with Edison bulbs hanging and thick wooden slabs as the table, I liked the place. A small tapas style place, Liz and I got the cheese dip, guac and a few tacos. We decided not to indulge in a Margarita, even though they looked good! We stuck to eating our calories. Our service was fast and friendly, always a good thing for a new restaurant.   The guacamole was fresh, chunky and a tad spicy. The Cheese dip was different, not a white creamy kind usually found in southern Mexican joints. It actually tasted more like real cheese, it was filling, just not what I was expecting.   The el pastor taco with pineapple was deli-sh as well as the fish tacos. I'm sure we will be visiting this place again.   Warning- Be careful where you park since this location doesn't have a parking lot. We parked int he Harris teeter lot ( and they didn't like that very much ) Also, they don't have outdoor seating.",

Our group headed up from the burbs on a Saturday night. We had 6 and they don't take reservations. The wait was 75 minutes and that was cool since we were not in a rush. Lighting is cool and it was very busy but not uncomfortably crowded.  The girls found seats at the corner of the bar and the guys bellied up to a \"trough\" bar top nearby. Bar service was quick and it was noisy but fun. After we were seated we started out with fresh chunky guac, creamy queso and a green salsa that was tasty. The menu is small but varied enough. I had the spicy pork tacos which were hot but not over the top. The short rib taco was my second taco and this was delectable. Highly recommend. At the table several ordered the  fish tacos and were happy with the choice. It was a great group night and didn't break the bank. Considering I ate 17 lbs of chips and dip two tacos were plenty of food. Enjoy!",

Very underwhelming the queso tasted like it was reheated and held at too high of a temperature...was very grainy. For my \"entree\" I ordered two tacos one Al Pastor and one Brisket Taco. Al Pastor is my favorite taco and this one was to say the least the worst one I've ever had....small bits of pork smothered in chunks of pineapple...traditional Al Pastor is slow cooked pork with the pineapple cooked along with it to impart more flavor.....this was not the case with this dish. The brisket taco was no better...shredded flavorless meat in a poorly made taco shell. Had I not been so hungry I would have left after the first bite of both tacos. And the service can be summed up with this interaction between the bartender and new guests walking in ...\"Sit anywhere???\" Asks the guest and the bartender responds with \"Yeah I guess So\" Needless to say I won't be going back any time soon.",

The location is challenged, in part due to his checkered past of poor restaurants, but namely because of an abysmal parking situation.  With valet parking available at the evening, I opted for nearby parking across the street at Harris Teeter for the quick walk over.    Firstly, they did a phenoninal job on the remodel.  The restaurants-past are barely visible when looking at the new layout.  Kudos.  Secondly, the food.  By all measures, a very simple menu, but extremely well executed with fresh ingredients.  The service matches the approachable and easy-going feel for the restaurant.  Dare I say, this one might actually make it in this location?  I give Bakersfield 4 starts for a good vibe, good food and great guac.  Repeat visit on the horizon.",

    "text": "Perhaps a victim of bad timing just after a trip home to California, the popular taqueria / bar has the interior and service that is buzzworthy, but the food fell flat for me.  Let's start with the name - Bakersfield. In the 70s & 80s it and Fresno vied for the unenviable title of the armpit of California. Perhaps it's had a big renaissance and is a hip unknown treasure unbeknownst to me, but even my friends from Central Valley chuckled that we had a restaurant named Bakersfield and thought maybe it was a bad omen.   The exterior is super hip with the wood-slat awnings, garage door windows and lack of tacky signage. The interior has a warm cozy feel with lots of unfinished reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs hanging everywhere and a busy stream of patrons.  They really nailed the feel of the place and I hope they stay for a long while in this seemingly cursed spot. Finding parking is not easy when the Valet lot and street parking is full, so hopefully they might strike a deal with another local business to borrow space after hours.   The service is impeccable - very very fast food delivery and attentive service.  If you wish, you could get in and out for dinner in 30-40 minutes if you don't have to wait for a table and you're not drinking cerveza out of their adorable boot shaped glasses.   But the menu...ugh. First, I've never been to a taqueria that didn't give free chips. C'mon folks. Jack up the cost of each taco by 1 buck and give us free chips already. The prices are reasonable, so just build it in. Second, if you don't want a taco, you are really limited to tostada or 2 different tortas. The sides are also quite limited. We did have the corn chowder which really sticks to the ribs- perhaps the cheesiest, thickest chowder I've ever had. It is fantastic with their chipotle salsa on top.   For the main attraction, los tacos, they have 8(ish) different choices- two different chickens (mole & cider braised), pastor (pork & pineapple), two different vegetarian choices, a fish (mahi) and braised short rib.  My choices were really limited because I'm allergic to cilantro, so I had the mole with pickled onions and mahi without the slaw. Hubs had mahi, braised short rib, other chicken and pork. The tortilla are house made. Honestly, none of the tacos sang for us. The short rib was particularly dry, the mole was more acidic than smooth mole-ish like you want it to be, the cider braise was way vinegary, and the pork was fine.  The mahi was the top choice for both of us, though only comes with one fish finger in the middle, so don't expect to fill up on 2. Honestly, Pinky's & Cabo Fish Taco have better more filling choices.     I saved my rant for the end, so feel free to tune out now. [Steps on soapbox] As I said, maybe it was just because two weeks ago I was in the SF Bay Area and had 2 stellar flavorful taco experiences (Tacolicious and Magdaluna), and this just paled in comparison, but I don't think so. If Charlotte wants to be taken seriously as a World-Class city, we better put our big girl pants on and get some world-class cuisine. Smaller Durham and Chapel Hill even seem to be outpacing us. There's no reason why this town can't have a really good taco place or good Chinese place, etc. There's nothing magical about Californian tacos. At this point you can pretty much get every single ingredient here as you can there, so they should be just as good. Tex mex places especially have gotten lazy (hear me, Picante, Vida and Maverick Rock Taco??) and think if you put any crap in a shell people will like it or eat it.  Maybe it's that most of these places don't have that Mexican heritage? I'm trying to reach for a good reason. And no, I'm not a haughty Californian- I've now been in Charlotte longer than the Bay Area, so I'm rooting for Charlotte to get better. Sometimes we all need a kick in the pants.   So, Bakersfield, sorry for the tangent, but if you want to get serious about having good food in addition to a cool bar, recruit the guy from Burrito Factory to come in to help you with your menu/sauces. Until then, we won't be back.",

    "text": "Ah, Bakersfield. How you try. This place is way too hip for the average commoner - make sure you dress accordingly. The food is great, if you don't mind the occasional hour-long wait. The ambiance is cool, when they're not vacuuming all the seats around you three hours from closing time. Basically, Bakersfield has a lot of potential, but it's got a few kinks that could be ironed out. Bring date, not kid",

During this time we also got to chat with the owner, such a nice guy.   We finally were seated. We ordered margaritas, guac, queso with chorizo and an assortment of tacos. Everything was delicious! I had the fish taco and would highly recommend it. Very reasonably priced too.   I also really like the vibe and atmosphere! I hope this place can survive in Dilworth, it is a great addition.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for someone to crack the code to make a restaurant or bar work out in this space for a while now, and Bakersfield has done it! This is maybe more of a bar than it is a restaurant, but it works great on both levels and is pretty authentic mexican street food...don't expect cheddar cheese and sour cream and lettuce on your taco. The specialty drinks are top notch and worth the price, but you can drink more cheaply from the decent beer list or daily specials. There is a great tequila and whiskey selection.  Don't be a baby about the lack of parking. It's a densifying neighborhood only a mile from downtown in a growing city, you're not entitled to free plentiful parking everywhere. Take a cab/uber, walk, bike, or park on a side street a few blocks away.",

    "text": "What a great new treat to East Blvd.  We arrived on a Friday night around 7:00pm and was told it was a 10 minute wait, not bad at all. We proceeded to the bar, which is amazing. A great wrap around bar with a long communal standing table on one side.  It was crowded, but we were able to sneak in at the counter and order drinks. I chose the house margarita, WOW, loved it! It was definitely made fresh and had a great tequila kick.  My friend ordered a beer, which they do offer a great selection.  After around 10 minutes we were seated at a high table in the front of the restaurant. We started with the chips, salsa and guacamole. All great!  As for entrees, I chose the Mole Taco and the Tostado. The others ordered a variety of tacos.  I will say the Tostado was AMAZING. Black beans with chicken on a lightly fried tortilla, it was one of the best I have ever had. As for the tacos everyone said the Mole and the Short Rib were the best. The service was great too, a definite added bonus.  Only downfall, the TVs and noise level was very high, we felt like we were screaming the entire time.  However, the food was well worth another visit and a new frequent stop for those of us who live in the Dilworth area.  Thank you Bakersfield.",

    "text": "We had no idea what to expect walking in here. We were blown away. The ambience, service, drinks, food - even the music - all outstanding. The best Mexican food I've had in years. The queso is insane. The guacamole is insane. It was hard to make room for the rest of the menu, which is - wait for it - insane. That good. Can't wait to go back. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant already planning my next visit. Don't let the parking scare you off. Park across the street at Jersey Mike's (it's allowed). Try a Paloma. Have a shot. Get the queso.",

    "text": "So. Much. Potential. With a long history in the food service industry, I am always sure to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but Bakersfield has swung very hard, come very close, and missed.   I've had a taco before, believe it or not, and this particular taco was certainly above average. The problem here lies with the atmosphere and service. My party placed their orders... Actually... Screamed their orders over the music (which was cranked to 11). When the food finally arrived, it was presented on one large tray and left to us to decipher what was what and whose was whose.   I didn't mind the food, but the margarita was pretty weak, and the overall experience lacked polish and enthusiasm.  I wish I could say I'll be back, as the restaurant's concept and mission are something I look for in a dining experience. However, the overall experience was a huge letdown... My future Mexican outings will be to Paco's Tacos.",
