With so many Indian restaurants sprouting up in this area, i am surprised that they feel no need to provide quality food and service. This one is the worst. Their dum biryani is the most sub-standard biryani. Other items i have tried here are no better  Another restaurant to cross out.",

They all took the time to talk to us about the menu and make suggestions.  Raja shared his journey to Charlotte and then to his decision to open this restaurant.  An impressive career to be sure.  The food was excellent...enough to eat well there and bring leftovers home for later.  The menu is vast, the restaurant is large but welcoming.  We usually eat late but got there around 7:30 and it wasn't that crowded, but soon the restaurant was filled with families and individuals, including many many Indians, which is always a good sign that the food is authentic.  We will definately go back.  There is lots to try, and the friendliness of the waitstaff and its owner will make it a pleasure to see them again.  Thanks for the recommendations guy!",

Gongura chicken gravy was above average and could be better. Complementary rice quantity and quality could improve. The worst was the chicken tandoori. It is not easy to cook good tandoori and so we generally avoid it at most places; however, considering it was an andhra based indian restaurant, we took chance and failed again. I will give few more chances to the place to have few favourites and reorder them in future.",

The flavor was good, but the dosa was so crispy that it fell apart/crumbled like a cracker when we tried to rip a piece off (usually it should hold together and be a little chewy) and there was only a small amount of masala potatoes inside. We really enjoyed the tomato chutney that came with the dosa. The dal soup was good, but really spicy! We did not try anything else on the menu. Overall, we thought the food was ok and service mediocre, but will likely not go back.",

Upon arrival we where seated immediately. We ordered samosas, butter naan, chicken tika masala, tandoori chicken and a Marsala chai tea... everything was delicious, served hot and fresh! Authentic, medium spicy wasn't to much for this light weight. Servers where very attentive and friendly. Would def go back when in the area!",

Now coming to the ambience part of the restaruant, I think this is one of the worst places. Looks very unhygenic and even the waiter and waitress here don't know how to attend to the customers. They constantly drop the silverware and I've noticed that they don't sanitize the cutlery and plates properly, which leads to a big hygiene issue. I would not recommend this place to anyone! Ever!",

Everything was so good - I had a tiny bite of almost everything and I wanted to get more but was just too full. So many offerings and I can't decide what I would have gotten seconds of - each taste was delicious. From reviews it seems they may not be consistent or that they recently changed owners but I got there right at opening on Sunday and it was perfect food. It felt a little weird being there before other customers and it was totally quiet as they finished setting out the buffet and served my pitcher of water. but then they turned the Bollywood musicals on the tv and it had plenty of customers, mostly Indian, by the time I left. First to come in were single guys and then families and couples started coming. So the vibe is very casual but they take hospitality seriously and most important very delicious fresh food- but if you are kind of ocd about decor details it will bother you. If you're open to an adventure of food do it! I will be back this weekend it's so good I wanted it all week.",

My second time to this place was for a to-go pick up and it wasn't a feel good experience, importantly because of their hospitality.  They don't greet you, they keep talking over the phone and show hand gestures to you so you don't know if they ask you to wait, sit somewhere, talk to someone or get out or whatever.   PLEASE greet your customers and be professional.  From other reviews, I understand the taste and quality has gone down a lot.  That's sad!!",

    "text": "There's a pretty good divide here between food quality and service. In short, the food is good and the service is horrible. The menu is huge and making a decision is almost more difficult because of that. But not to worry, I imagine whatever you order will be good.  I went with three other people and when we arrived there were only a few other tables occupied. So we figured we lucked out considering they ought to be new and popular. We waited. Finally got our drinks ordered and waited some more. Finally got our food ordered and waited while they brought out each person's meal over the course of 15-20 minutes. The first meal came out mere minutes after ordering and the last meal came out probably 10 minutes after the one prior. It was as if the first one was made and sitting around on a hotplate waiting to be ordered and the last one had to be made from scratch. It would have been nice to just receive all of them at the same time or at least within a few minutes of each other.  To add to the timing issue in receiving the food, we were disappointed with the responsiveness of servers. As the time went on the restaurant packed in steadily and they had no clue at all what they were doing. Just getting a water refill was near impossible. When you'd finally call a server over they'd either look bothered or confused. As if to say you shouldn't be drinking water so fast. I guess we were talking a lot and getting parched because we had no food to eat?  On the food note, it was as expected from an Indian restaurant. I ordered the Paneer Butter Masala and it meshed perfectly with the rice. On the \"Chinese-Indian\" fusion portion of the menu (something unique I've never seen at an Indian place before) there were several interesting dishes. My friend ordered the Chinese noodles and for the table we ordered the Shanghai Chilli Paneer which was spicier than expected but still good. It was also confusing because this was on the normal menu but was actually a small dish app. As for the last two people they ordered a couple of dosas. I'm not a fan of dosa myself but they both had no complaints about them or the sauces. Both had plenty of potato inside and 3-4 sauces to dip into. It was the Mysore Delight Dosa that came out almost instantly and became a bit cold by the time the last dish (the other dosa) came out.  In conclusion on this review though, this would not be my first, second or even third choice when I think I want to try Indian again. They do have a lunch buffet however so I would be willing to come back for that. At least then perhaps I won't have to deal as much with the poor service.",

The health inspection sign on the front wall had a score of 90... not good! When I got home, I checked the previous scores and this place had scores of 72 and 75 in 2017!?!  Finally, the previous restaurant in this location had an open kitchen with wrap around windows. Godavari has draped up black fabric along the inside of the entire length of the window, completely blocking any view of the kitchen. It looks so odd, it makes you think they must be hiding something to go to that ugly extreme.  There are at least a half dozen better Indian restaurants between U-city and Concord Mills. Skip this one.",

Then it's not for you. The staff was very kind and worked as a team. The majority of the clientele was Indian. I ordered samosas and chicken tikka masala. My friend ordered a spicy shrimp and butter chicken.  Everything was served fresh out of the oven or stove, still steaming. The samosas were very aromatic, full of spices. The crust was nice and flaky. I love anything with potato's, so I was in heaven. 10/10. The shrimp were spicy, but not crispy. My chicken tikka masala lacked flavor. The tomato wasn't tomatoey enough. I wanted to add more depth to the flavor. Also, the chicken itself wasn't good quality, and didn't taste fresh. Compared to other Indian restaurants that serve this dish, it didn't stack up. 6/10  I sampled my friend's butter chicken. It was better than my masala, but not anything that wowed me. The butter flavor was prevalent. 6.5/10.  Service was adequate. They were quick, everything was served hot, and they were friendly. Food could improve. Come for the appetizers.",

    "text": "I have been to my fair share of Indian Buffets, and while the food was not bad, the lack of variety was something I have never seen in any restaurant. Perhaps I went on a day where they did not expect many customers, but besides the lack of dishes the quantity was running low(almost no chicken in the curry) and the staff was not replacing it until a huge crowd of lunch-goers arrived. Not only did I see many promises of this being the BEST buffet in Charlotte, many people also mentioned a dosa station--which was obviously not there.The only choice for dessert was a few mixed melons(not even gulab jamun!) and for anything else like kulfi(ice cream) it would be extra payment. Overall, there are PLENTY of better Indian Buffets in Charlotte at the same price point, don't waste your time!",

They had a wide range of dishes including a live dosa counter.  Food was medium spicy with a lot of flavors.  Definitely, this place will have many reviews for their seating and interiors as the floor was quite slippery which may cause anyone to fall.  But food and service is great !",

The dishes were limited, flavors were bland, and service was lacking.  Our kids didn't eat anything and was still charged the crazy kid price (about $7 a piece) even after talking to the staff about it.  Don't waste your time.  There are better options out there.",
