I was left confused as to why she did that... I told her we had many things to order, but she just left; I speak both Spanish and English so it was not a language problem, and up to this day I don't know why the customer service was so bad there.",

A few tips to set your expectations and appreciate the good food. If you're in a hurry, don't come here. Ask for \"la cuenta\", while enjoying your meal, don't wait till the end. The good: the fruit drinks are fantastic and the variety of flavors make this a \"go to\" place. The empanadas are good, but not spectacular. The arepas are my weakness and the reason I return to this place. Lastly, the lunch specials are very good and well priced, offering homemade soups, well seasoned protein offerings, and the beans (lentils or frijoles) are always fresh and seasoned well. As a Colombian, I recognize the long wait for a menu, or your check, as a cultural issue for these small business owner. Just relax, enjoy the food, and if you're in a hurry .......don't be afraid to go to the counter and ask to pay for your meal. The smile, gratitude, and great food  you receive is worth your effort.",

My food was  a fish fillet, came with a side salad, green plantain soup (my husband had the lentil soup I thought that was better)  and tostones that were done perfectly.  They also have a small panaderia or bakery.  We got some coconut roll guava thing, an amazing guava mousse that looked like a custard (amazing) and pan de bono which is a Columbia bread made with cheese.  This was the best pan de bono I have had, however I have only tried three others.  3 stars because the food was cheap and good, decor is blah, but the owners were super nice. Bakery stuff was good :)",

They told us that they just opened and not really prepared for it. If they are not prepared for good service or food, they shouldn't been opened.

I went today, 02/18/15 during lunch, and had the arepa pollo (~$8), which was really good by itself...but when our waitress brought out their jalapeno sauce, and I added that...it was to die for!  My friend ordered something that looked like an open taco, which he loved too.  We did have to wait a bit (~25-30 mins) for our food, but our waitress told us that up front, since they make everything fresh, so we were ok with it....and for us, it was worth the wait.  Note that this is definitely a hole-in-the-wall, diner-esque place, not a fancy restaurant.  So if you're looking for atmosphere and ambiance...this is not the place.  But if you're looking for really good, fresh food at reasonable prices...definitely give it a try.  I will definitely be back!  PROS: Really great food, good prices CONS: Moderate wait time, no atmosphere",

They take way too long to bring your food - they even take a very long time to bring you a menu. When my co-workers and I walked in today we basically waited a full 10 minutes to even be acknowledged (and there were only 2 other tables taken). Someone in my group had to actually get up grab some napkins and wipe our table as the 2 waitresses were simply ignoring us. Not sure what that was all about. I had not been to this restaurant in many, many months and now I remember why. NEVER going back there again. The food is simply ok (definitely NOT good enough to overlook everything else that is wrong with this place). If you want better Colombian food and GREAT service try Los Paisas (and no I have no affiliation to that restaurant - it's simply the truth)",

That helped me decide on 5 stars also because if you use Yelp like me, I have to order from pictures!! So check mine out.. the steak with eggs on it, rice, perfect plantains and DONT treat those carrots like they're decoration, that was my favorite!! Like dessert! It has slices of mango in here and with a passion fruit vinaigrette it was beautifully sweet. I can't wait to try everything!",

Arepa's prices seemed quite reasonable, but their entries were not on the cheapesr side - $13-15. But they were humongous.  I had a fish entry, and my hubbie had a steak entry with egg on top.

Aside from that, great experience. Keep it up, Las Americas! We'll be back!",

The portions are rather large (like most Latin American restaurants) so the prices are great. You can easily split one plate for two meals.",

Maaaaan please, don't ....more food for me. Moving forward, the wait staff was great...my family and I were greeted when we came in and we did not have to wait a century to be waited on. You are going to pay $10-$13 bucks for food but listen, don't freak out. You aren't purchasing the ingredients or preparing the food which is freaking TASTY.

I don't know what they do to their food but most of what I have bought there has not settled well with my stomach, and I realized it's not just me when I took a couple of people with me to eat and gave them the same effect.

I bought a round pastry that had guava, cream cheese and caramel inside.  The outside was so flakey and dusted in sugar.  Next time I have visitors, I'm getting these for breakfast danishes. I bought the alfajores.  They are like 2 soft sugar cookies with Carmel between.  The Carmel is to die for.  It has a slight milky taste and not quite as sweet as the Carmel I'm used to. The macaroons were a tad bit disappointing.  They tasted nice but we're a bit cold as if they had been slightly frozen. They gave us a sample of some round bread and again, OMG, this bread was amazing.  Seriously, someone knows what they are doing here.  Will definitely be back !",

Also had the fresh passion fruit juice and loved it. It's not overly sweet and separated naturally so you know it's the trap stuff! Loved that!

    "text": "So my after lots of Love Week fun with my church, my incredible bestie {who's Colombian} took me to one of her favorite Colombian restaurants. I love when she and I can drive around the city, serve all day and be foodies!  When I walked in the restaurant they have lots of decorations celebrating the Colombian team during the soccer World Cup. This truly warmed my heart to see the restaurant supporting their country. Then we sat down and the server gave us two menus. One with the lunch specials and a regular one. I liked that she immediacy spoke Spanish to me. Because although my Spanish is VERY minimal I'm still working VERY hard to learn Spanish. It's going to come one day lol.   My best friend suggested I pick something from the  $6.95 lunch menu. So I followed the pro and ordered myself the chicken plate with fries, rice, beets salad and vegetable soup! Yes you get ALL OF THAT FOR $6.95 lol. Then she ordered the friend fish with fried plantains, beets salad and fish soup. The Friday selection on the lunch specials menu offers three different styles of Colombian lunches.   But listen... my vegetable soup... BANGING! I will go back and order that in a pot style if I can lol. It was sooooo good! It made up for how small my chicken breast was. I wasn't too happy about that. My lunch plate had a half piece of chicken breast that was super thin. Then looking at my besties plate and she had two pieces of nicely cut fish. Thankfully she's amazing and shared her fish with me lol. Oh and she ordered us some empanadas which were very yummy and I love the green sauce they gave us too! Other than my small chicken breast I truly enjoyed my first experience eating at Las America's and my first Colombian restaurant!",

    "text": "It took me several months to return to this little family run restaurant/bakery tucked away behind K&W Cafeteria located at Tower Place Shopping Center in Pineville. Although it occupies a space in which several other restaurants have failed, I believe that, based on the bustling crowd the morning that my wife and I had a late breakfast there, it is going to be a long term success.  Until this meal, I had no real experience with Colombian food and the fact that we were the only non-Hispanic customers in the packed little dining area only added to our experience. We had the thin steak with onions and peppers and a ham and cheese omelette. Both were prepared perfectly, were savory and very affordable. The accompanying bread however was lackluster which was a little surprising  considering their excellent bakery items. Speaking of which, we also tried their homemade cheese buns at $1.25 each and had the Tres Leches Flan (yes, for breakfast dessert) for $3.50, all of which were tasty.   The coffee, Colombian of course, was good however it was quite disappointing not having real cream. In fact it was the small things that were the most disappointing, such as serving margarine instead of butter with the bread and regular milk instead of cream with the coffee. We also did not know whether to be seated  or stand in line upon arrival however none of that will prevent us from returning.  The service was very friendly but a wee bit slow. The sanitary rating was a 95.5 and the entire restaurant was very clean but a little worn and appeared to be somewhat under construction. It's simpleness added to the experience in a way. We definitely plan to return for lunch and for more bakery items!",

Not long, a big bowl of black beans followed by a platter of food was placed before me.  Interesting combination of spiced ground beef, fried plantains, white rice and a cold side which I enjoyed thoroughly. I quite literally cleared the plate. Absolutely delicious and while not \"hot\" it was spicy with tasty flavor.  Big plate of food, less than $8. Another few bucks for a tip and I was on my way.",

I ordered grilled strips of chicken that were served with the traditional rice and beans and sweet plantains.  I also splurged on a beet salad, which was maybe my favorite thing.  As much as I have traveled in the Latin countries, I have learned that beets are a staple.  Much more so than how we eat them in the states.   So, I wanted to try them here.  This was a down home Colombian restaurant that seemed very native.   From the styrofoam cups to the plastic straws and young kids hanging off the sides of the booths, yes this was very Latino.  This is also a bakery and there were large loaves of bread that were displayed on a rack near the registers.  I can only imagine how yummy the bread  must be.

    "text": "I really don't know how to feel about this place. I ordered something I can't pronounce and the meat seemed like low quality - the steak was chewy, unseasoned, and had a bunch of that gristle, fatty stuff (how hard is it to remove it? There were like two other people eating here), and the chicharron also lacked flavor which is very hard to do because chicharron doesn't need seasoning because it's all flavor - so I don't know. The rice, bean, and veggie part of it were really really good. Super flavorful.   Then I had the flan. I have never had flan this good. This flan is the type of flan that could bring America together. I love this flan.   Then I had an empanada dessert. Hmm. Terrible is the only way to describe it. I took two bites and threw it out. The bread was not sweet - it was very stiff as well. Did not taste like bread. I've hand many a savory empanda - store bought or handmade by friends - the breading was always consistent and tasted the same. I was hoping at least for a crust here that would have had a low bar expectation of a McDs apple pie.   So overall - I don't know.",

    "text": "My favorite Colombian restaurant in Charlotte! Staff makes you feel at home and food is great. I always get a chicken empanada and bandeja paisa (no beans, they always make fun of me for taking the beans out lol) YUM! Always make sure to ask if they have churros, they are to die for. Omg my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I read someone's review complaining about the coffee...I understand their point of view but omg this place has so many different plates and desserts and they just complained about the coffee not being \"authentic\" I understand giving 1 star for bad coffee if this was a coffee shop but it's not! I mean, did they even try the food?! That's the entire point of going to a restaurant, eating food! Seriously this place is great, a definite must try for anyone looking for great Colombian food.",

    "text": "Another poor excuse for a \"Colombian Bakery\" or Restaurant. One of the fundamental and key components of a bakery is \"CAFE CON LECHE\" (Cafe con leche is a Spanish coffee beverage consisting of strong and bold coffee mixed with scalded milk in approximately a 1:1 ratio.) Without the basics you cannot consider yourself a \"Colombian Bakery\" or even a latin bakery!   I can only assume they rely on inexperienced customers who wouldn't know authentic from inauthentic. As soon as I walked in I began scanning the area for a traditional expresso machine always found in Latin Bakeries! Once again the infamous American coffee pot was their version of \"cafe con leche\" , needless to say I left disappointed and confused.   How is it possible in ALL of Charlotte that no one makes authentic CAFE CON LECHE?",

    "text": "Food is a hit or miss, though their soups are pretty good - but pricey in my opinion. The one problem I have with this place (and why I never go there anymore) is the HORRIBLE SERVICE. Everything takes so extremely long. Don't bother trying to get in and out during the 60 minutes of your lunch hour - NOT gonna happen. And furthermore, you can't ask to be seated in a specific spot - for example: the LAST time I was there, I walked in at about 10:45 am with my husband & daughter and asked to be seated at a booth (there were 3 available), the woman in charge there said \"No, we're waiting for the lunch rush and I can only sit 4 or more in booths\" WTH??? So we sat in the small table she chose for us. We finished up at about 11:30 (chose to only get coffee and some bakery items) and as we left we noticed 2 of the booths were still empty!! Yeah I'm not a fan of this place and therefore will NEVER frequent it again.",

The place is clean and simple, service is good and quick. The food was really good and tasty, I suggest you try their coconut flan  is out of this world delicious!! Yeah we will be back!!

A small quaint restaurant that offers tres specials per day at a shockingly low price. The friendly employees offer their suggestion if you're struggling to pick a numero.  After going with the chicken breast special, they first brought out a mouth watering bowl of soup followed up quickly by the main dish. Sooo much food it's crazy! I managed to clear my plate and boy was it tasty, especially with their choices of spicy sauces. They are also a bakery with homemade baked specialties ... can't wait to try that delectables as well.  We will definitely be back to check the other daily especiales!",
