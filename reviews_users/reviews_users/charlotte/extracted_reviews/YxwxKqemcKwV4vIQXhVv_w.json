I typically stick with a simple cheese pizza; however my friends typically go with something more elaborate and we all agree it tastes great. I like how you can very easily make your own pizza and the people who work there now know me and my order (and my allergies). The staff is extremely welcoming and definitely make my day when I visit. The shape of the pizza definitely mixes it up and is a great addition to make it unique. You always know when people have Zablong pizza because of the box. I highly advise everyone to stop by here for a quick lunch or a late night snack on weekends.",

We were craving pizza and I hopped on Yelp to find a good pie nearby. Followed the other reviews to this little joint tucked away in Charlotte's \"French Quarter\", and man, were we not disappointed. We ordered two of the menu pizzas, although the option to make your own with whatever you wanted was tempting. We went with both The Vampire Slayer and The Tripping Goat and two beers. Total was about $30 bucks which can't be beat. Both pizzas were so so so good. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone in Charlotte looking for some quality 'ZA! 5 Stars.",

    "text": "Conclusion from finally checking this place off my bookmarks list: Never want to eat other pizza without ghost pepper salami as long as I live.   Cool spot in Brevard court, indoor and outdoor seating. We got there about 11:30 on a Saturday so not much going on. The staff was super friendly and made sure to ask if it was our first time so they could give us a lay of the land.   So many topping choices it's overwhelming. Went with the Woodstock and added ghost pepper salami. Solid choice, but everything on the menu looked pretty good. I liked that they placed the toppings evenly so each of the slices had the same amount of toppings. And as everyone says, you can get as many toppings as you want and it's still a $10 pizza. Pretty cool. I even made 2 meals out of mine.",

    "text": "Dropped in during a drink at the French Quarter and ate this pizza with friends in the courtyard. Stumbled into this place late night with little prompting (they are open until 3am) and picked up a pizza and was pleasantly surprised!   Any place that lets you add any many toppings as you want and has a variety of sauces you know it's going to be good. And all for about $10 each pizza. I got the gluten-free crust and you couldn't tell it was gluten-free at all and the people I fed it too never suspected! Gluten-free crust can be hit or miss, so was very glad it was a HIT!  THE STAFF- actual smiling faces! I know it must be tough to work in the food service industry, especially late on a Friday night, but every person I interacted with pleasant. From the guy who sauced my crust (ha ha ha), to the guy who took it out of the oven, and girl at the cash register- all smiled at me and didn't even ask for a tip.   I would give this place 4.5 stars because that half a star demotion is because of the name of restaurant. When we saw the sign above the door, it looked like 'blonq'. So we stood there at 11pm after a few drinks trying to sound out the name! Is it b-long because the pizza is long in shape? It is 'blond' because you can get a white pizza? I don't know, what do you think?? It wasn't until I got my receipt I saw the real name of this place- Zablong. The 'Za' letters in the sign are unreadable. NOTE TO OWNER: Get a new sign, so late night drinkers like me can find you and continue to eat here!",

If there's a line, it will go by quickly as long as the people in front of you researched the menu and know what they want.  There are menus available while you are waiting, so be prepared.  They offer three different crusts and an amazing assortment of sauces.  The ghost pepper pepperoni is the way to go if you like some additional heat and spice. There is also a cold topping station where you pay (parm cheese, red peppers, olive oil, etc).  No one should ever leave there hungry.  There are shared tables (beer garden style) inside and tables outside.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.",

Pork belly bacon, ghost pepper salami, prosciutto, caramelized onions... oh man... the list goes on! It's really easy to go overboard on the toppings, but I would recommend restraining yourself.

So, when I saw people walking around with the distinct rectangular boxes, I made short work of tracking down it's new location (which happens to be in the French Quarter behind Latta Arcade). As with the place I ate at in DC, they have a menu with a few signature pizzas. But don't let that limit your creativity. Because on the other side of the menu, for the exact same price they list all of their sauces and toppings. I think you could eat here every day for a year and still not get through all of the possible topping combinations. On this day I had a regular crust (they have multi grain and gluten free too) with tomato sauce and pesto basil spread. From there I was like a kid in a candy store with the toppings adding both some delicious meats and veggies on there. At the end, my pizza was piled higher than I originally intended but for the same reasonable price. This place should be a must try, must re-visit option. Don't get me wrong, it's not THE best pizza in the city, but it's a great lunch or dinner. And with all of the variety, a place you will never get bored of, and should always leave satiated.",

Service here was impeccable - the employee was helpful with explaining to me how everything worked and what all the options were.  He even helped suggest some pizzas I might like.  I eventually built my own, but he was kind, friendly, and patient.  5 star service for sure!  These pizzas are massive.  At $10.06 after tax - it's really a steal.  It's also too much pizza for a single person, so I'd suggest sharing or planning to save half for the next day.  I like that they have whole wheat and gluten free dough options here.  There's also a ton of sauce options, along with meat, cooked vegetables/cheese, and toppings such as basil and other kinds of cheese you can add on your pizza afterwards.  You can't really go wrong here - especially when you can build your own.  May I suggest ghost pepper salami, angry sauce, artichokes, and the GARLIC PUREE!!!  Don't forget the garlic puree, you garlic lovers like myself!  My only thing was the pizza became a little soggy after only a very short walk home.  They also don't really have that many options as far as spice goes - no red pepper flakes (at least when I was there) and only hot pepper oil.  You can add fresh jalapenos, but that's a little scary.  Otherwise great deal, great service, and great food!",

Anyway, the pizza is rectangular shaped and you choose what you want on it from the sauce to the toppings and it ready in about 5-7 minutes. Delicious!!! Will definitely be going here again! Oh and the pizza was like 11.00 but worth..::I actually had two meals off it.",

You can get every single topping and it will cost the same as a cheese pizza. Amazing.  Their toppings are fresh, the dough is fresh, and the decor? Yes. It's fresh.  Will I come back? Of course. There's plenty of restaurants in the area, but I will always choose Zablong. And then I will walk to Amelie's for dessert.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to concur with many of my fellow Yelpers.  Zablong is Da Bomb!    My wife and I were hanging at the Wooden Robot and had a hankering for Pizza.  I pulled out my trusty Yelp and Zablong popped up.  It was a bit of a drive in the wrong direction, but I was in the mood for a good pizza.  The establishment itself is little more than a hole in the wall with a few rows of tables separated from the baking area by a single wall.  There is some outdoor seating too.  Ultimately we chose to sit outside because it was a nice evening.    Their Pizza concept is simple.  Pizzas come in one size: 18\".  They have several signature pies or you can create your own.  The Prize is $9.29 no matter what: Makes choosing their toppings a no stress proposition.    I had intended to create my own concoction, but when I saw their Southern Comfort signature pizza, I was sold.  It has Southern Cream, Garlic Puree, Mozzarella, Sweet Corn, Pork Belly Bacon, and Fresh Basil. Perfection!  You automatically get 8 slices and that turned out to be just the right amount for me and my wife.    So, if you're alright with braving the construction and finding a parking place in downtown, then trying out Zablong's is a no brainier.  In fact, it's a Yes Brainer!   5 for aesthetics, 5 for service, 5 for taste, and 1 for location (That's just me...I hate driving into town).  I give them 5 stars for an absolutely awesome experience.  Despite the time it took to get there and home, I'll brave the traffic to try them out again.  Mucho Kudos!",

    "text": "My new favorite pizza place in Charlotte! For $10 you can custom-design any pizza your heart desires. Seriously, unlimited toppings...I couldn't believe it!  (Deep breath)  Okay, so I started with the Southern Comfort signature pizza from their menu. It came with southern cream, garlic puree, mozzarella cheese, sweet corn, pork belly bacon, and basil. I chose it mostly because of the garlic and the corn (which I had never seen on pizza).  I was asked if I wanted any additional toppings, so I added delicious-looking caramelized onions. I figured only the basic toppings were free, but when she asked me if I wanted any more, I threw a Hail Mary and requested shrimp. The woman behind the counter not only obliged, but she seemed genuinely delighted to be loading my pizza with more toppings.  I became a little embarrassed to be adding so much, so I told her to go ahead and stick it in the oven. As my pizza started its slow journey, I spotted some tantalizing meatballs. I must've been drooling or something because the woman noticed and asked if I wanted some. Of course I did! In a flash, she grabbed them, broke them up, and sprinkled the meat onto my pizza just before it disappeared out of sight.  Sure enough, on the other side of the oven were even more yummy toppings begging for me to pile them on. Before I even realized what I was doing, my pizza was full of kalamata olives, pineapple, and parmesan cheese. I was finally done!  My finished product probably looked like Frankenstein's monster to a pizza purist, but it tasted freaking amazing. I guess if I had planned ahead better, I would have omitted the pineapple, as it tasted a little out of place with the other ingredients. Anyway, it was not a terrible problem to have, and my solution was to simply start picking them off and eating them separately.  The pizza is very large for the price, and with all the fresh toppings to choose from, you're getting incredible value....This was basically all I ate for the whole day. If you're still hungry afterward, then you only have your lack of imagination to blame!",

You start off by picking a crust and sauce, and then from there, you are off and running piling on unlimited ingredients.  We got chicken, pepperoni, 4 cheese, part cheese, etc, etc, etc.  Then they cook your pizza in about 2 minutes.  The pizza was delicious, too.  It wasn't overly greasy and it had a lot of flavor.  (I recommend the red pepper oil)  It's not NY pizza, but it is great flatbread pizza.  I look forward to going back and piling on some new ingredients in the future.",

The pizzas are large rectangular pizzas and easily enough for two to share. Typically, my husband and I will do half and half and just share the entire thing!  We recently came to Zablong on Friday to grab a pizza before a show. There are so many topping options at this place that I usually get overwhelmed and make my husband order the entire thing. On this occasion, he ordered half tripping goat and half meat lovers. I absolutely love the shroom truffle oil on the Tripping Goat. I believe he also added pork belly to the meat lovers. That is the beauty of this place, unlimited toppings. They have some odd toppings too like pork belly, shrimp, different oils, etc. All pizzas are $10.  Pro tip - They are open till 3am on the weekends if you are craving some late night munchies!",

For under $11, I got a pizza customized with two different sauces, unlimited toppings--each half-and-half, a $#1t-ton of cheese, and falafel and fig.  Seriously amazing.  Two adults were both totally, totally full.  Too full to even think about ice cream (which as butterfinger and chocolate sounded like a great idea BEFORE we sat down to eat but several hours later we still are stuffed).  The shape makes it really nice to customize as a half-and-half or to split with someone else.  And I love the thin crust and tons of cheese.  This is absolutely going to be my go-to pizza when I'm in the area (i.e., at home and not at work).  Lost a star because the server was incredibly difficult to hear and understand.  But aside from not knowing exactly what everything was or how it all worked, after one round I'm comfortable enough to say I've got the hang of it.  Still wish I knew better what was in all of the sauces and what, exactly, each of the different meats were, but I'll just try them all eventually I guess.",

I ordered the vampire slayer---garlic and ricotta base with salami. Maybe it was just the ingredients on this particular pizza, but it was extremely oily and the crust a bit soggy. The flavor was great and the price was in line with the quality ($9.29). If they can speed up the line and get the crust crispier, I think they have a winner.",

Though the name is different now {Peculiar Pizza} the pizza was phenomenal! They allowed me to taste the different red sauces, I liked the peanut one but I decided to stick with classic. I placed so many yummy toppings on it and coated my pizza with CHEESE !!!  In the oven for 7minutes and while I waited I played Sudoku on the tv screen {very cool because it took my mind off my serious hunger pain lol}. Before I knew it my pizza was READY. The guy recommended additional toppings at the end and I couldn't say no... that would be CRAY CRAY!   People if you haven't already check out Peculiar Pizza {or whatever the name will be when you go lol}. Just check it out I'm sure the pizza style won't change!   You're WELCOME!",

When I explain to people what it is, I refer to it as designer pizza! I've never ordered from the preset menu (the vampire slayer is on my radar), I always build my own. The crust can be white, wheat or gluten free. There's a variety of sauces to choose from as your base...then it's toppings time!! The basics are available: pepperoni, olives, mushrooms, etc. But then there are non traditionals like charred broccolini, carmelized onions, falafel, ghost pepper salami (which wasn't scary at all), etc. Once the oblong shaped pie exits the oven, there are finishers. Arugula, parmesan cheese, bbq sauce, basil oil, etc. If you are indecisive, visit when the traffic is low, this way you can decide without holding up the line of hungry pizza enthusiasts!!   This is a great place and the staff is always entertaining and friendly!!",

The crust is good, I had the multigrain, nice and nutty flavor, then i loaded it up with basically every meat I could find!  It only takes a few minutes to cook then it is time to eat!

As many of the other reviews have mentioned, that night was a little hazy, but I remember the 'za being delicious. I also did not realize that anyone else referred to it as 'za. I'm giving it a sixth star for that alone!  They have a great assortment of different straight-from-the-menu options, or a build your own option. I took the easy route and ordered the \"Southern Comfort\" from the menu. Topped with pork belly bacon, garlic puree, and (delicious) sweet corn, it really hit the spot. As far as the generalities of the pizza, it is more of a flat bread cut into eight pieces. Easy to make two meals or a meal and a snack out of it.   The French Quarter and Latta Arcade are definitely underrated spots to grab a bite and a drink, but I believe Zablong is a stand-out among those!",

Dough pressed and laid out, then the pizza is assembled in front of you. Unlimited toppings and yes, they mean unlimited. The pizza is oval shaped, similar to the sort of pizza that I enjoyed in Rome. It's a thin crust. And it's quite tasty.  I opted for the \"Angry Sauce\" and topped it with cheese, mushrooms, red onions, red peppers and grilled chicken. The pizza wasn't five minutes in the oven and then it was boxed and ready. A great deal for $10. More than enough for one. Almost enough for two.  They have a couple of bottled beers in the cooler and a Coke Freestyle machine.  Zablong is located in the Latta Arcade, closer to Romare Bearden Park.",

So anyways it's a local place, small but cute. It's in the French corner downtown to the right, it's around Likesome bars and other restaurants. I absolutely do love this place because it can't be beat for the awesome flavor and price.  cmon now it's like $10.99 for a pizza of your choice. Along with that you can add unlimited toppings for no extra price such as pork belly, shrimp, chicken, peppers, arugula, etc. It's a rectangular semi flatbread. So you can order a pizza of their choice, or build your own, or a pizza of their choice and add additional toppings. I definitely recommend it, i got the vampire slayer along with some extra toppings! I can't wait to go back and eat some more. It's a must every time i hit downtown.",

It's like the subway of pizza - you go in, pick your dough, add your toppings, wait 2-3 minutes for it to be cooked, and voila!   I ordered the Tree Hugger on whole wheat dough. I comes with Oregano Oil, Fresh Mozzarella, Caramelized Onions, Arugula, Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Fresh Shaved Asiago Cheese. All the ingredients seemed fresh, and I loved the dough. It creates a thin crust that is still pretty soft. My pizza took just a few minutes to cook and it was so good. This place is great if you're in a time crunch but still want something somewhat healthy and not \"fast food.\"   The only challenge is parking at Latta Arcade (and uptown in general). Luckily, John and I had taken the trolley uptown and were walking around. This is great is you're in the area and need to get lunch or dinner somewhere.",

I didn't think I'd eat it all when I saw how big it was, but I licked my plate clean.   The service was awesome and ridiculously friendly. It was a Thursday night and the team was rocking out.

The line moves quickly so don't be discouraged during the lunch rush. Everyone is super nice and even had energy to crack jokes during the lunch rush, much appreciated. I like to use their special pizzas, like the Vampire Slayer, as a base and add as needed. I thought the spicy chickpeas and red chili oil were unique and delicious. The ricotta spread gave awesome flavor, I wish all pizzas had a ricotta spread! The crust was nothing short of perfection, more flatbread/thin crust like. All in all wonderful pizza and very flavorful, beat out Brixx in that aspect.   I do suggest cutting the cherry tomatoes into quarters instead of halves. Just would make things easier.

The two best things about this place: they are open until 3am on the weekends and three words: ghost pepper salami. Seriously, GHOST.PEPPER.SALAMI.  Zablong is a fast casual type concept where you can order from their menu or build your own. There is a laundry list of toppings. No matter how you want it, it's the same price. Less than $10. My current strategy here is to get the Meathead with angry sauce and add mushrooms, jalapenos, pineapple, sundried tomatoes, and crushed red pepper oil. What can I say, I'm a toppings whore. For the vegans out there, they have a lot of great options to fit your desires. For me, I can turn into a pizza into two meals.   The workers are always super friendly and happy, which is a lot to say when you're open until 3am and dealing with drunk people. They probably all deserve hugs and holidays named in their honor.   Zablong, thank you for being the spot Latta Arcade and the alley has needed. You are doing God's work over there.",

    "text": "Great little pizza shop in Charlotte! You can top your pizza with any toppings and the price stays the same, which is awesome! The man that was working there was from Detroit and was super friendly and offered some great suggestions for toppings. The corner pieces were our favorite but the whole thing was fantastic! We ordered a plain cheese for our 5 year old, which he loved. And then my husband and I ordered a pizza with angry tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, green pepper, red onion, roasted red peppers and jalapeno....delicious and SUPER filling. When you get a pizza with that many toppings, it's definitely shareable. Overall, great experience and we will visit again.",

I highly recommend finishing your pizza with the red pepper oil.... Amazing if you have pesto basil sauce!   Kid-friendly... Wet-erase markers for them to mark freely on the clear-top tables.   Best pizza place I've been to in Charlotte so far....",

What impressed me most is the more upscale ingredients I have not seen at other locations.  They had roasted cauliflower, goat cheese, and red pepper oil to name just a few.  I love meat, and they also have a great selection of meats.  However, for my chosen pizza on this night, I made a vegetarian pizza that was packed full of flavor.    Seating is a little tight, and if you have kids, you may want to consider splitting a pizza instead of buying their own (unless you are planning to take home some left overs).  This is definitely a place I will make my way to again any time I am in uptown Charlotte.",

My kids love any Coca Cola Freestyle drink machine, I can't they even guess the combo they concocted.  Za Blang also offers a small beer by the bottle selection.  You can sit inside at the communal tables or outside in the alley patio area.  We sat outside, it's shaded so even in summer you'll comfortable.",

This restaurant is also known as Peculiar Pizza. What sets this pizza shop apart from the others (such as Blaze, firestorm, Firenza, etc.) is that they have toppings available before and after your pizza goes through the oven. In addition they have the best toppings overall with a huge selection of quality ingredient, sauces, drizzles, and cheeses! They also have whole wheat (as well as traditional and GF) crust! One order is plenty and you can even have some for dinner! Only thing that's not great is the parking situation if you're out of walking distance but it makes for a great lunch!",

    "text": "While having a quick meeting in French Quarter, a friend of mine got hungry and so we walked over to Zablong (now Peculiar Pizza). The inside was very colorful, graffiti on the walls and various colored stools to go with the long family style tables. The atmosphere on a free night is fun lighthearted and very very diverse for this little pocket of bars - which I was pleasantly surprised! The service is fast and the food only took minutes to prepare! The waitstaff was respectful but worked quickly as the line on a Friday night at around 12am was getting long. Here, unlike places like Blaze pizza (which I also love) you can puts all the toppings your heart desires from shrimp to artichoke to prosciutto! It was crazy to me I knew never knew this place existed. The friend I was with preferred the following - garlic and classic tomato sauce mixed together, cheese, spinach, shrimp, pork, peppers, artichoke, and a drizzle of ranch. How he invented this I have no idea but when the taste was amazing! The sauce was INCREDIBLE - the garlic packs a nice zesty punch! The shrimp was nicely seasoned as well as the pork- creating their own pockets of flavor. The artichoke, peppers, and ranch added textured crunch and even more flavor to the dish which the spinach also played well into. My piece from the pie took me on a rollercoaster of goodness! And for those watching their waistlines, the pizza is basically a flatbread and they have a wheat option.",

There are several other similar places around town, and they've become recently popular, where you start with an unbaked crust and add your toppings before it's quickly baked. I think this is the best with the greatest variety and quality of toppings. I love that they offer wheat and gluten free crusts in addition to the typical crust, and that the toppings are unlimited. What really made it for me were the sauce options to drizzle at the end, I had the fig sauce and a bit of rosemary oil. So good!

You just cannot go wrong with the pizza here because you can customize as you desire and also their signature pies are just as amazing. Love it Love it Love it.  Zablong has become our recent go-to place for a pizza (especially when craving for one).  For 10 bucks it feels like you get a great quality pie, with fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection, and portion sufficing two easy or one very hungry person, lol. Their uniqueness starts right from the basics, the shape of the pie.  Yes its not round its oblong. I love it when things get little off the traditional way.  Their website - it looks amazing and scrolling works sideways and up-down (may not be unique, but definitely different approach).  Their toppings - they have all the toppings that you can imagine.  Great meats (we tried only chicken so far), veggies, spices, dried and caramelized veggies, spicy oils, fruits, cheeses (including vegan).  Only place with so many different kinds of toppings and veggies we have been to so far.  Toppings are unlimited and one can build their pie as creative as possible or as hungry as one is, lol. Its open late - yepp big plus.  Its open pretty late in the weekends and when feeling guilty or need midnight food, you got a great place to go and for 10 bucks! This is our recent love and am sure will be one for a long time.",

I felt like the name was dumb. I wasn't crazy about people describing it as \"Chipotle, but for pizza.\"  Those things are all True, but Zablong is worth your time and your ten dollars.   Even when the line is long -- which it often is during lunchtime -- you're in and out in a reasonable amount of time. Your pizza is custom-made and the ingredients are well-curated. The employees are attentive and efficient. The patrons are all so happy to get a tasty pizza that even the wait time is pleasant.   It's easy to dine gluten free or with other dietary restrictions. The menu is clear about what's safe for different diets. My favorite part is that the GF upcharge is modest (just $1) and when you ask for a gluten free crust, the employee helping you will ask \"Is this an allergy or a preference?\" If you, like me, have Celiac disease, each person down the line will change their gloves and use designated utensils. They take cross-contamination very seriously at Zablong. I so appreciate the extra effort.   The menu changes slightly and seasonally almost each time I visit. I hope they bring back the horseradish cream sauce; it's a real delight!",

Mine had spinach, mushrooms, regular and fresh mozzarellas and really good ground up falafel. Yum! Soda fountain is Pepsi products so thankful for Dr. pepper cuz Pepsi is no bueno.

The choices were delectable such as ghost pepper salami (must try, AMAZING!), oregano infused oil, toasted spicy chickpeas, and sauteed shrimp just to name a few.  The vibe was urban meets uptown, but good for all groups not just the late bar crowd.  The staff was super friendly and helpful, helping us navigate the options and making some suggestions too.  I definitely want to go back as there were so many combinations to try.",

Choose your crust (I like multigrain), choose your sauce (angry tomato is my fave), pick a cheese (quatrro formaggi pleaseandthankyou) and then decide on alllllll the toppings. You can get one topping or twenty, matters not to the cashier. Your pizza creation is going to be $10 no matter what you tell the kind man behind the counter to throw on top.   My favorite toppings are meatballs, caramelized onions and mushrooms pre-bake. Once it's out of the oven, there are additional toppings available. On that side of things, I usually go with an oil drizzle, parmesan or asiago, arugula, sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto. Are you drooling yet?!?",

The pizza is always perfectly cooked and crispy. They offer a ton of topping options - I definitely recommend the ghost pepper salami. It's not as spicy as it sounds, but it's really good!

I had many pies already, and it rarely hit a False note. - Then baked in conveyor oven. - Fresh toppings are added for the finishing touches. - The tripping goat is to die for (without the crumbled goat cheese for me.) I don't want the poor goat to trip. - Pay flat rate ($9.79+tax.)  Why you should embrace Zablong? - Best part about a night of drinking, is the eating after. It's pretty predictable, and my favorite is always yummy PIZZA. So going over to Zablong for a pie before the night is over, is a good idea. Trust me. Zablong last call around 2:30am Fridays and Saturdays. - Perfect for quick lunch. - Vegan and vegetarian options are available. - Location. Location. Location. At Latta arcade.   Five Yelps.",

We walked in (there were games on the wall - score!) and were greeted with a cool atmosphere and a great guy working. We hadn't been in before and he let us check out the menu and talked us through the whole process.   We opted for the specialty pizza on the menu already instead of creating our own with spinach and sausage but added some pepperoni and banana pepper for no up charge! It was so reasonably priced (only $11 for a decently sized \"personal\" pizza).  I thoroughly enjoyed the music and graffiti on the walls in addition to the delicious pizza as well as their support for other local businesses and events - we learned about a local baseball game from our quick lunch stop!   Great place, great people, great food. Nothing better than that!",

    "text": "Stopped into Zablong for some late night food on our Saturday in Charlotte. We ended up splitting The Vampire Slayer signature pie with a few substitutes for some missing ingredients.   Quality Zablong has a reputation across the city of Charlotte as the late night spot. And its not just because of its hours or prime location, it actually turns out some solid pizza. I decided to go with one of their signature pies, The Vampire Slayer. This pizza uses a roasted garlic puree and ricotta spread as its sauces, and then loads it with peculiar cheese blend, ghost pepper salami, basil leaves, and black pepper. Unfortunately on this evening they were out of the ghost pepper salami, which was the main draw for me. They replaced it with pepperoni, but it was definitely much less exciting. The pizza itself was good, maybe a little heavy in the center, but the crust had a great crisp on the edges. I enjoyed the unique sauces used, which gave a nice twist instead of the standard tomato based sauce. And it was absolutely packed with cheese, a big plus as far as I'm concerned. I get the draw as it is a snack that can definitely soak up some alcohol, but I imagine it is also quite tasty during other hours of the day too.  Quantity The pizzas come in an oblong shape that are about 18 inches long and 6 inches wide. It was more than enough for the two of us to share, though most people on line looked ready to devour their own.  Value The signature pies all cost $11, which is not a bad deal for the size and quality of the pizza. You can also definitely maximize the value by throwing on extra toppings.  Ambiance Zablong is located in the Uptown area of Downtown Charlotte. It is part of Latta Arcade a pedestrian only street lined with bars and restaurants. On a weekend evening the area was packed with people. Zablong stands out with its bright neon sign hanging out from the brick building. They have seating outside, but by the time we arrived it was a free for all. It seemed like most of the tables were being used by non-customers. When you enter the restaurant you are met by a staircase. You make your way to the right where the pizza creation station flows. Customers can go down the line designing their dream pizza or select a pre-designed pie. When you come out the other end they have a few inside tables along a graffiti wall. This area was also packed, but at least with pizza eaters here. The music blaring and the vibes good, but a little crazy.  Crowd Saturday night meant a line out the door. Right smack in the middle of a busy bar area, Zablong is the go to lack night munchies spot. Everyone on line was some level of inebriated, with more than a few struggling to even stand. This also meant a lot of indecisive customers, really slowing down the process.  Service The guys slinging the pizzas could very easily have been on the other side of the glass. They all seemed eager to head out to the bars at the end of the shifts and were asking some of the customers where the party was at. And while this laid back attitude made them perfect for dealing with the unruly customers, it meant that no one was refilling ingredients and mistakes were numerous.  Parking The area is populated with bars and therefore drunk pedestrians, so I would not necessarily recommend driving to the area. But if you do there was some street parking as well as a few parking garages nearby.  Extra Through all the chaos, Zablong definitely has some solid pizza. But dealing with the crowds and the inattentive staff is a less than enjoyable experience. If you know what you are getting into though, the end result is worth it.",

There's a ton of toppings to pick from so chose wisely ... or just pack on the meats like I do.   Location: 4/5 Pros: Surrounded by bars. Literally. Also right across from Romare Bearden park in case you're trying to get a mid-day picnic going. Cons: Street parking is a bit hard to find around there but there's some lots.  Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4.5/5 Pretty chill and laid back. Free Wi-Fi. Interactive TV with games. No outside seating but it's pretty bright and open. Customer Service is on point too (5/5). I've never had an experience with the staff there and I've been here during the day time like a normal human being and during the late night post bar shenanigans search food.   Quality: 5/5 You can make a solid scrumptious, mouth watering pizza here ... so what if it's not round. Think outside the box.

Did I mention you can pick as many as you want for the same price?  The pizza is $11, big enough to share with a friend and you can load it up as much as you want, it comes served in a to-go-box so you can sit and enjoy or take it home.

I love the fact that you can choose as many or as little toppings as you want from their amazing selection, such as fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, housemade meatballs, spinach, etc. This place also suits those with different dietary concerns/restrictions as they offer gluten-free dough, vegetarian and vegan spreads/sauces, vegan mozzarella, and lots of veggie toppings. Oh and at the end, as an added bonus, you can choose EXTRA toppings (e.g. basil leaves, crumbled goat cheese) and drizzles (my favorites are the strawberry balsamic and fig marsala).

    "text": "Super friendly employees and really unusual pizza. I've had it second hand before (as in my friends catered a get together with it, and it was barely lukewarm when we ate it, but most people other than myself were too drunk to care), so I went to the source to try some different stuff fresh out of the oven... but they don't do slices, so I haven't been able to try any hot and fresh yet. The cold-ish slices were around 4 star but they intrigued me, however they should really sell pizza by the slice here, if only for my benefit.  When they say Zablong, it sort of means Oblong, I guess, because that's the shape of the pizza. They remind me of the shape of Beaver Tails in Ottawa. Couldn't taste more different though. The Vampire Slayer was amazing at the party except that nobody who had eaten anyone could make out with anyone afterwards, no amount of mints and teeth-brushing can fix that damage.  One thing I'm not crazy about is having all the toppings laid out in front of you like a Cali-style pizza spot, or a Subway or something. It just reminds me of Chipotles and Millennials. Not that there's anything wrong with Millennials, but a lot of that sort of food, to me, is garbage. This place is not, so don't get distracted by the format. It's really good pizza. I'm not ready to give it 5 stars yet though.  Apparently Za is pizza and Blong is belonging. But I still think it's connected to the oblong nature of the pizza.  Anyway I'm off to listen to the Linkin Park song, Somewhere I Blong.",

    "text": "Echoing off of Bruce's review- Zablong is listed as one of the best pizzas in all of Charlotte - and although I wouldn't say it's the BEST pizza I've ever had, I have to admit that this is some pretty bomb pizza.   After admiring the long pizza boxes that nearly every Uptown worker carries daily I thought I would finally give Zablong a try. I mean I've worked in Uptown for 2 years now...  I tried it one Friday and popped in around 1:30. There wasn't a line, but if you come around 12/12:30 there is usually a line out the door. I ordered the Tripping Goat (from the menu), but added turkey meatballs and chicken to it. The Tripping Goat consistent of mushroom truffle oil, roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, fig marsala, crushed red pepper and salt/pepper. It was dynamite! The flavors were blended awesomely and they topped this bad boy up!  Unlike Blaze Pizza (ps I love Blaze), the crust was a little thicker and held your pizza together better. They have much fancier toppings than your usual pizza joint (think asiago cheese, pork belly, broccolini, prosciutto) and they aren't shy about loading up on toppings. My co-worker asked for a quote/un-quote \"Shi* ton of prosciutto\" on his pizza once and I think they gave him over a pound of it. No lie! It was ridiculous!  And for $10 a pizza you can't go wrong.",

As someone with a cow's milk allergy, it was fantastic to have a pizza made that I could eat without digestive distress- and it was delicious, too!  It was a regular crust, fiery tomato sauce, vegan mozzerella, pepperoni, ghost pepper sausage, and red pepper, then topped (after firing) with chevre, arugala, and balsamic.  One of my teens also had a custom built pizza and the other had \"the Vampire Slayer\", and both were very satisfied.",

To date this is probably one of my favorite pizza places I have tried in Charlotte. The best part is that the pizza heats up beautifully in the oven for leftovers, just as good as the day you got it. I knock it down just a tad because some of the preparers are a little more heavy handed than others with the sauces. (I enjoy garlic but it was tad much) .

We each only ate half of our pizzas and were full. Another awesome thing is that they are EXTREMELY friendly to dietary restrictions, with everything on the menu of toppings marked as vegetarian and vegan. They also have a gluten free crust option (+$1) and it was REALLY good. Not at all soggy or crumpling or too crispy as some GF crusts can be. It's a flat rate to build your own pizza, which is perfect for my husband and I, who have quite different pizza tastes. Out the door with leftovers for under $25. I don't know why there wasn't a line out the door and packed tables, to be honest. I would absolutely recommend.",

Crisp crust, perfectly seasoned sauce, and fresh &  flavorful toppings. Top it all off with a delicious flavoring oil on top and you have a perfect quick-serve pizza! My son and I shared the Meathead with Crushed Red Pepper oil. Crazy good!   I'm fairly certain my waistline will regret me trying Zablong as I see many Zablong pizzas in my future!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite make your own pizzas in Charlotte. I know the concept is widespread and there are several of these types of restaurants to choose from, but I definitely think you get your moneys worth here and I feel like the quality is just a step up from the others.  The pizzas are around $10 which I feel is pretty on point for the average make your own pizza place... Maybe a dollar or two more, but it's definitely worth it. They have several different sauces to choose from and although I've tried several the pesto is my favorite! They do a good job of not over powering the sauce, but if you're into that you can definitely ask them to add more.  They don't have a super rough wide selection of cheeses, but I feel going with the shredded mozzarella and a fresh mozzarella is always a win! I mean if you're getting a pizza in there is an option for mozzarella and you're not getting it... What are you doing with your life?!  They have a great selection of toppings... I wouldn't say anymore or any less than other places and the ones I always seem to get it always taste and look fresh!   The pizza is more of a rounded edge rectangle shaped and I feel like you definitely get much more or at least it seems quite a bit bigger when I'm eating it compared to the round ones you typically get at these restaurants.   They are quick and the line tends to move fast if they are super busy! There isn't a ton of space for sitting down to eat inside and the tables are quite thin, but I'm not going to judge the place too much on that.   So to conclude, if you're looking for a good pizza that can be made quickly for you to sit and enjoy right there or take home and eat... This is the place for you! Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about my next visit to them!",

You feel like you are in NYC chilling with the coolest \"in\" crowd around!   While there is an urban vibe to the place, don't expect NYC style pizza, or Chicago deep dish style. This place makes custom flatbread pizza.     It's like a sub shop, but for pizza!  You pick your sauce, protein and veggie toppings, then you watch it take a slow magical ride through the pizza \"conveyer\" belt-type oven.  They have fun names for some of the sauces and toppings.  The garlic sauce is called \"Vampire Slayer.\"  The spicy sauce is \"Angry Tomato\" and so on.  Once your \"Za,\" is baked, on the other side it's boxed and additional toppings of your choice are added for maximum delight!   For a pizza with spinach, mushrooms, red onions, green pepper, sun-dried tomatoes and chicken on it, I paid just over $10.  The pizza was rather small, but could easily feed two adults. I wandered into this place by chance.  I left feeling like I had a unique experience.",

They have so many different sauces, fresh and quality toppings you can put on the pizzas that I've never tried before. I opted for the Margheritza pizza and added pepperoni and black olives A classic pizza with a \"B\" twist. Located in French Quarter so the location is convenient and around other cool down to earth restaurant, bars and lounges. They even have outdoor seating.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this pizza spot for a while and had the chance to try it last week for lunch.  We decided to go a little early before the main lunch crowd started to come, which was a good decision because the line can get started very quickly.  It was a good idea that I looked at Yelp beforehand to get an idea of what I wanted.  I tried to look at their menu online, but could never get the menu to come up.  I think it would be beneficial if they fixed that as you can get very overwhelmed when going to a place like this and have to be quick on your decisions with so many topping choices.  It would also be nice because we were going to order  1/2 the southern comfort, and the toppings have completely changed than what is on menu pictures on yelp.  We decided to order  1/2 Meathead and  1/2 Southern Comfort (now is which chicken and onion instead of bacon and corn).  We added additional toppings to both sides.  I love that we could do a half and half and get as many toppings as we wanted.  Now for the taste.  Meathead gets a 5 - this was hands down a wonderful side!  Loved every bit of it, the sauce, the meats, and just the over all taste.  The Southern Comfort gets a 2 maybe a 3.  I did not like the sauce and just taste of it.  The toppings were fine, but the sauce ruined it for me.  So if I had only had that pizza, I would have not been impressed.  As I have learned with MOD pizza which has the same concept, you really have to know what to order and get the right thing.  I have to give the edge to MOD with these pizzas that are made quickly on the spot with as many toppings as possible.  I like the taste better with MOD and they do have a choice in sizing, can get personal or larger sized pizzas.  It would be nice to get a personal size here because the last thing I want to do is be carrying a box back to the office.  Luckily, I was with someone to split and we took care of that issue by eating it!   I struggle on giving this a 3 or 4, wish I could give it a 3.5, but I feel like I have to down grade it to a 3 since I didn't like one side of the pizza, they need to fix their website, and would like options for a personal size pizza.  Fix that and it would be a 4.",

    "text": "Tucked away in a narrow alleyway in the Latta Arcade, Zablong Peculiar Pizza was a legitimate find!!   Enjoying a Sunday in Uptown Charlotte before a major sporting event at the nearby Bank of America Center, I stumbled upon this alleyway full of bars, restaurants and a great deal of people \"pre gaming\" before the match. The line at Zablong was long and daunting but moved surprisingly fast. The \"Tree Hugger Pizza\" was absolutely delicious, a long rectangular shaped pizza just bursting with color and fresh vegetables. Thought there was no way two of us could finish it but it was gone before we knew it. Crust was perfect, ingredients (mozzarella, onions, olives, arugula, cherry tomatoes) were fresh and the flavor was delightful. On the shared table we were seated at, almost everybody had a Zablong pizza in front of them and were raving about it. Would definitely re visit and wish they had more locations.",

    "text": "Peculiar Pizza Please and Thank You!  Zablong's is tucked into the Latta Arcade... Probably one of the most things I miss about working right off of Tryon, is coming to the arcade and all the lunch options during the day.  The \"inner\" locations are probably very easy to miss, unless you are seeking out places.  The last time I went to Zablong, I don't remember a staircase, but that could just be me... I felt like there was another tenant upstairs that had the staircase in the center, but whatev's it's there - but don't go up.  You walk in and decide on your crust style... then go down the assembly line.  You can either do a signature pizza creation or customize your own.  I usually do a half and half signature pizza and add on whatever I feel like.  Farmhand is definitely the way to go... they also have the pizza for goat cheese lovers (which is also amazing).  Servers are really nice and make sure your pizza is just the way you want it.  After the pizza is assembled, it makes its way through the oven and you get to customize it even more!  Chili Flakes, Cheese, Oil, are just some of the options located on the other side of the oven.  Beers in bottles here... soda machine.  They will pour your bottle into a plastic cup for ya.  After you've paid, make your way \"under\" the stairs and into the dining area with some communal tables.  They do have some outdoor tables as well.  I'd imagine this place gets packed during lunch... but we were there for dinner and it was super cool sitting inside and looking at the graffiti brick wall.",

    "text": "I had seen this place featured on some Charlotte afternoon talk show along with a few other places and where the pizza looked good on TV, it was the online menu that sucked me in! Goat cheese, pork belly, pureed garlic! Sign me up! We recently found ourselves on that side of town (directly across from the Knights baseball stadium) so we knew we had to go. This place is tucked into an alley so Street parking isn't all that easy; I recommend going ahead and parking in the parking deck. The restaurant is very small and you order your pizza pretty much the same way you order from Subway or Moe's. Everything is right in front of you and they just pile it on...my husband got the meat eater and it's pretty normal- nothing out of the ordinary there but why go to a place like this and get something you can get anywhere?! That's like going to Baskin Robbins and getting vanilla! I settled on the Southern Comfort...a sweeter Alfredo sauce, cheese, basil, pork belly and corn. Added caramelized  onions and the girl making the pizza suggested I put some Italian sausage on it - sure why not! She also said \"I know this is gonna sound strange but when it's done, let me drizzle some honey on two pieces and see if you like it\" Honey? On a Pizza? Ok, I'm game...what a game changer! Omg! Wow! I can't even tell you how good it is- I'm glad she suggested it because I would NEVER have done something like that! This place is worth the hint to find! I promise you won't be sorry!",

Zablong was recommended to me by a friend and I will never get my pizza from anywhere else in Charlotte. The pizzas are massive (enough to split between two people easily), taste delicious, and are super affordable (only $1 for GF upcharge...that's amazing). The staff there is always super friendly and they even take extra precautions if you tell them that you have an allergy. The only thing that I would change is that there would be more locations around the city, so I could eat there more often!",

If you drive too fast, you'll miss it.   I went in the WEE hours of the morning (probably 130ish). Staff was still friendly and upbeat. I literally inhaled my pizza, so it must've been good LOL  I got a ranch drizzle on the top. The \"drizzle\" was definitely way more than what other oven fired pizza places. For ME, that was a plus because typically the drizzle is like two small streams, so much appreciated. I didn't need any dipping sauce. The cheese was well cooked through & it wasn't sloppy or falling apart- which are also two problems I've encountered from other pizza places.   Can't really comment on the type of atmosphere considering my friends and I were the only ones in there and it was literally 5 min before they closed. I can also say that even though they were close to closing time, they weren't rude and didn't rush us when we were placing our orders.",

    "text": "Who stays open late and has an open clean restroom?? Zablong that's who. While visiting the Charlotte Shout festival we were in desperate need of food and an open restroom for my niece and nephew. We walked all around the festival area and I remembered that I needed to check Zablong off my Yelp Too 100 of 2018 list so we headed there.   If I had of know the exact location I probably would have tried this wonderful place earlier. When we got there there was a small line and an open restroom, thank goodness.   I wasn't too excited about the menu but decided that I should stick to their recommendations and try one of their signature pies. I decided on the Vampire Slayer after I was able to sample the ghost pepper salami. The nibblings got a cheese pizza.   The Vampire Slayer was a good mix of flavors. I absolutely love the mix of the roasted garlic puree and the ricotta cheese spread. The Salami wasn't spicy at all but had a nice bit to it. I did add mushrooms, red onions, arugula and goat cheese on top. The mix of flavors was amazing. It was such a great combination.   The actual restaurant is tiny with just 3 long community style tables and a few seats and tables outside the restaurant. They do recycle the pizza box which is a concept that seems both great and creepy at the same time. I'm weird a little bit of a germ freak at some times.   My nephew noticed the open case in-front of the register and we were told that in the summer it will be filled with homemade ice cream!!! Can't wait.   All together 2 pizza were shared between 4 people and we had almost full box to take home. I will define back soon, since I'm already dreaming of the ricotta spread!!!

They let you do half and half on a pizza which I love. I'm all about variety.   Based on Yelp reviews, we got half Vampire Slayer and half Tripping Goat for one of our pizzas and build your own for the second. We added caramelized onions to both and pork belly bacon to the Tripping Goat. On our build your own, we did southern cream sauce (recommended by the guy making our pizza), fresh mozzarella, capicola, salami, roasted red pepper, caramelized onions, artichoke hearts, prosciutto, parmesan, and balsamic.  I'll start by saying they were all delicious. I think my favorite was our build your own. The southern cream sauce was amazing. The garlic sauce on the Vampire Slayer was a bit intense. The Tripping Goat was on the sweet side, but very good.   This was hands down the best build your own pizza place I've been to. It's also some of the best pizza in Charlotte (probably my favorite after Neopolitan). Their sauce and protein variety really sets them apart.   If you haven't been here, you really need to try it. It's a great value and delicious food.",

    "text": "Zablong lived up to its rating.  At first glance when you walk in the door I was thinking how can this place have such a great rating. The inside is small and not so appealing.  There was several people working the counter serving up pizza in a rather fast pace.  I watched as they all seemed to work well together and kept the line moving.  I ordered the meathead and asked for onions to be added.  My son ordered the farm hand.  This was my first experience with BYO (Build Your Own) Pizza. The crust is basically a fresh flatbread.  It reminds me of a Subway but for pizza and on steroids.  They are not stingy on toppings at Zablong.  You can get whatever you want added and I'm large quantities.  I really like that they have two add on stations.  The one to build your pizza before it goes in the oven and the one to add items after it comes out of the oven.    My pizza was absolutely delicious. The ingredients were as fresh as you can ask for.  My son said the same thing about his.  The sauce was very good. A tangy tomato sauce.  The cheese was a good quality mozzarella. We decided to exit the crowded inside and eat at a table outside.  This place is located in sorta a ally type area that is full of pubs, craft beer taps, Vietnamese food, hookah bar, and plenty much more.  What a  neat little hidden oasis.    Well done Zablong!",

By the time we got our food though, the line was to the door (which isnt too hard as the space is pretty small). I love going to chipotle style pizza places. Super quick and you get a hot za. We split one pizza as we both had already eaten dinner. I like that they allow you to do a halfsies of two of the signature pies. We tried both the farm hand and the tree hugger. Our pizza was delicious. perfect crust with perfect balance of toppings. I would 100% recommend this place. Also it was a steal at $10.72.    Only gripe-- they dont serve any of their pizzas on the metal trays. They put everything in a cardboard box which they say they recycle (I don't know of many places that accept pizza boxes with grease). I really hope they do recycle or at least one day add in a more eco friendly option.",

    "text": "I actually cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place already. Hip pizza place with reasonable prices?! What more could you ask for in an Uptown establishment.   BYO personal pizzas are no longer the 'cool, new' thing by any means -- there's a handful of other chains out there doing the same thing. Where Zablong distinguishes themselves is in both presentation (i.e. pizza shape) & topping options (toptions?!?!?).   You'll be able to select from a list of pre-made 'Signature Pies', go with the complete BYO route, or anywhere in between. Some of the unusual sauce offerings include: Mushroom Truffle, Roasted Garlic Puree & Tomato Olive Pesto.   I have a hard time ordering anything other than the Tripping Goat -- it's core ingredients are just THAT good. I start with TGT base & usually add chicken, caramelized onions & bacon (it's thick cut pork belly style). They'll throw it in the oven so you can move down the line. While you wait, you can even turn around and take a selfie on their TV set up and have it sent to yourself. This is clearly a hit with the after 2am crowd. They'll finish off your pizza with any after oven toppings, and away you go -- anxious as ever to sit down and eat.   Side Note: This is place is also vegan friendly! Two different vegan dough options, 4 vegan sauce options + all the various toppings.",

OMG, I think I was really tripping because it was delicious! I love mushroom soup and it was like a pizza and soup combined. The pizza wasn't soggy with all the sauce and I love how I can dip the crust in the leftover sauce afterwards. The figs added was the perfect hint of sweetness and I even enjoyed the unique elongated shape of the pizza. I walked there so I'm not sure how parking is. It is located in the latta arcade.

What's not to love about picking out exactly what you want, watching someone else cook it and then having no dishes at the end? Well, I don't have the self control to think of blending the flavors together the form a masterpiece. I think along the lines of... it is all one price I will have everything! Zablong was great because my pizza builder was patient and sectioned off my crazy additions on different areas of the pizza as requested. He didn't even blink an eye when I asked if I could get just two shrimp on one corner to try it out.   I love that they had several dough, sauces and cheese options. They have a bunch of precook toppings and some post cooking conveyor toppings, sauces and my favorite additional cheese. There is also a menu of pizza combinations if you don't want to go wild choosing your own.  Having not been there before I got myself a pizza and my fiance a pizza but in retrospect we could have easily split a single one. The friend I went with split a pizza with her husband and got different toppings on each side so the one price fits all is an even better deal when you share.",

She was a little rough around the edges. Not nasty, but very curt. She did her job don't get me wrong. But the thrill was gone.  When we told her we need a Gluten free pizza, she did ask \"allergy or preference\" and when we said allergy, she took the proper steps to assure no cross contamination. She switched gloves, and wiped down the counter. It was appreciated. The pizza is \"subway\" style. Toppings precut and ready to customize individual pizzas . The pizza is baked in about 3 minutes on a conveyor.  I must say we enjoyed ours very much. Ingredients were good and the crust wasn't bad at all.  The dining area left a lot to be desired. Visibly Dirty tables and floors.  My only gripe... it's a pain in the butt to get here. Tucked away in Latta arcade area, Uptown Charlotte. No running in to grab a quick pizza. At least I don't know how.  I would like to try a conventional pizza to really get a feel of the place one day.",

Came here after 11 on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly chill--the line wasn't that long, the people behind the counter were killing it and the pizza smelled amazing. The pizza options are truly endless: you can choose some great pre-selected pizzas or take your pic of any amount of toppings for just $11. It's WILD. I made the perfect personal pizza, grabbed some soda and was sitting back in my hotel room all within 15 mins. Loved it, so sad it isn't a franchise or open where I live.",

So..being here for first time...had to creative to get the feel for the process.  Selected both doughs for the pie...wheat and white.  And began the easy task of selecting various toppings to top the sauces.  The server was great with explanations and descriptions of the veggies and meat toppings.  I have  had some great pies...but this turned out to be too good!!!  I have a \"Lunch Buddies\" group at work and could not wait to share the pics!

Expected to wait a long time, but was very pleasantly surprised how quickly it was ready.  They grab a lump of dough, put it through a press machine on the wall a couple times, then top it to order, put it on a timed conveyor belt oven, and it comes out perfectly cooked in a couple minutes.  Then they add flavored oils, and other fresh toppings as desired and then box it up for you. Boom. Fresh, delicious, fast, and cheap.  $10 for a pizza that easily feeds two.  Would definitely order again.",

Bf made his own and I got one from their menu (I really don't remember what it was called) and we both loved it! Came out hot and fresh and we chose to eat inside because it was raining but they do have outdoor seating. It's awesome that they're open until 3 am for those late night munchies after a night out! I highly recommend this place, we will definitely return!",

For a little over $9 you load your pizza with as much as you want, and then when its all done baking, you load on the final post baked ingredients (i.e. fresh basil, olives, arugula, olive oil, etc), the way it should be done.  Great crust, lots of different sauces, and it's a BIG pie,  you could eat the whole thing, but don't, that's probably way too many calories.    Only 1 Suggestion, and it might be a Million Dollar idea.  The wait can get a bit backed up, and that's inevitable, UNLESS, you pump some money into an online ordering system or simple kiosk ordering system and just let people mosey on up when they are ready to pick up their pizza.

We usually get a pizza each and customize our own and share among the 4-5 of us.  That way we get to try some of the many possibilities there are!

I normally prefer red sauce on pizza and so does my sister's fiance, HOWEVER this was the best pizza we have ever had without the typical pizza sauce. AND I must say it is on my top 5 list of best pizza I've ever had.  Didn't know this place existed until we walked by it and stopped but I will definitely be recommending it to my friends and family now.  Pizza 5/5 will be back shortly.",

    "text": "One of the best pizza spots in Uptown Charlotte.  When they first opened, I was a bit skeptical of the whole idea of peculiar pizza, but now I am a follower and believer.   Zablong is a custom - build your own pizza joint.   There are several suggestions they have on the right side of the wall, but you can put whatever you want on it.  Go hog wild and make a super meat pizza, or as spicy a hell pizza, or even as gluten free and vegan as you can make it pizza.  My suggestion is to don't over do it to much with the toppings and sauces.  Also, take the pizza to the park and enjoy the nice scenery. It'll be very relaxing and improve your outlook on life for the rest of the day.   DO PIZZA IN THE PARK!",

Pizza is decent but after having issues offering from them and trying to talk to management to resolve issues I will never go back. I was hung up on by the shift manager. After contacting them via Facebook I was told that they would address my issue and contact me within 1-2 days. It took 9 days. They contacted me back but wanted me to call them. Was given a number by Brandon to call. Tried, no answer, full voicemail box. Called the store. After talking with Brandon, who did not identify himself as a manager but as a consultant hired to run things, everything got worse. His staff lied to him about our interaction and in hindsight I realized that he wholeheartedly believed them. He had no answers and would not let me speak.he dismissed my right as a customer to be upset. I have never had a more unprofessional interaction",

They have suggestion /signature pizzas that you can add toppings to for no additional price. Be careful though, because you can definitely overload with the veggies and get an interesting mix!   The pizza goes through a conveyor belt and is prepared within minutes. Talk about efficiency! What's also great is that they have vegan cheese / protein, so really everybody wins.   The manager was so sweet, and everyone working there is so nice!   Definitely recommend coming here! It is WORTH the visit. (Custom pizza cost: ~$10.75)",

You order you crust, base, cheese and main toppings and the process kicks off. As you walk down the line watching your Flatbread get put together you see it get put in the oven. By the time the people in front of you pay and walk off your personal pizza is coming out of the oven and finished with fresh ingredients or flavored oils. You pay and you walk off at the same time with your pizza. Easily can finish the pizza or take half of it home. Plenty of food.   Check out the video wall as you wait in line and take a selfie or play a game as you wait.",

I went with a group of coworkers at lunch and the place was packed. I liked the decor and the layout but it is a small space and the line is hard to form past the door but once you get situated and moving everything moves pretty quickly from there. I ordered the Southern Comfort pizza. All the ingredients were fresh, the dough was great and the portion was enough for dinner tonight. While waiting for our pizza my coworkers and I took a selfie on their big screen tv and emailed the picture to ourselves.. Great feature while waiting. After the pizza comes out the oven you are able to add finally ingredients. I added BBQ sauce to mine. I couldn't finish my pizza but wanted to in one sitting. I will be back for more pizza !",

Parking is the only hard part due to it being in Latta Arcade. Since I don't want to pay for the garages, I usually have to circle around the blocks a few times to find street parking. Events in Romare Bearden Park also make this more difficult.  That being said, once you find parking, getting food from here is pretty low effort. You can order one of their set menu items or make your own. Items are less like a pizza, more like a flatbread, so don't go expecting a NY slice. What I really like about this place is the unique combos of toppings. One item has meatballs and strawberry balsamic on it. The Greek Philospher has a chickpea spread and falafel on it! Another, my personal favorite, is the Woodstock (minus the jalapenos).   It's quick, it's easy, and it's good. What's not to like?",

For $10 you can choose from their pre-selected pizza choices, or you can go down the line and grab your own array of toppings. There is a pizza for everyone at this spot!

They also have a menu of pizzas, including dessert pizza. We got the tree hugger, and we got a cheese pizza with no sauce for the kids. Everyone loved their food.

In my opinion, Zablong is currently the best of the new personal pizza trends through huge portions, lots of crazy toppings, and friendly staff.  I will admit the menu is a little overwhelming. They have several 'starter' pizzas, but I tend to spend too much time analyzing the toppings and sauce combinations so I often kick it to the staff to give me a start. I've never met a person in a bad mood there and they mention to me they help get customers started all the time. Also pro tip, the pizzas are long, not circular, so you can get 2 pizzas/sauces/types of toppings if you want. Honestly the portions are so large (and for $10, not a bad deal) that I often split with someone or save half for later. Regarding the toppings, they have some crazy choices like pork belly and will literally put any amount or combination on your pizza. So go ham - wait, I meant crazy. My only complaint is seating is pretty limited, but with Romare Bearden park right across the street I would prefer to take it to go anyways.",

    "text": "My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. There are an endless amount of places to grab a slice of pizza here in Charlotte but Zablong takes the cake for me. Located in the neat section of downtown called the French quarter so there is plenty going on aside from pizza.   The greatest thing about Zablong is the ingredients. There are so much to choose from and you can have whatever you want without a limit. There is a single price for the pizza and you just rattle off whatever is on your mind that you want on a pizza. Where else can you do this without worries of them charging by the topping? They've got your basic gourmet toppings plus a lot of others like shrimp, pork belly bacon, and for some reason pineapple??   Make sure to try a different base sauce as they have lots of different options to choose from there. After your pizza runs through the oven make sure to add some extra fancy toppings at the end to really give your pizza a pizazz. Customer service is always on point and they know what they are doing and can help you with any questions. If you need help grab a menu at the door to walk you through the steps and even see some of their pizza creation you might want to try.",

I love the customization.  You can pick from some of the pre-set menu options or customize.  It's the same price for anything you pick.  You order at the counter and they pop the pizza in the oven.    I love thin crust and this is perfect.  I had the whole wheat crust \"Tree Hugger\"...olive oil, cheese base topped with arugula, cherry tomatoes and black olives.  Delicious!  Eclectic atmosphere.  I enjoyed the hip hop soundtrack.",

Here you can make your own pizzas! they have unlimited toppings that are all fresh,so you can make whatever kind of pizza your heart desires. and  I guess zoblong is a take on the long shape of your pizza. It so good and the prices pretty reasonable. My only suggestion is that there would be more space. it is a little tight with your pizza boxes but not bad. overall it's a really cool place I love the love the decor of the ambience is really chill and the service is very friendly and nice.",

    "text": "Zablong Peculiar Pizza. I actually spent time researching the definition of Zablong or Zab even to understand the origins of this peculiar name. I had no real luck but the pizza is long and rectangular so I am going with that. What else is peculiar is that you stand at the counter and pick your crust type (white, wheat or gluten free) and your sauce and toppings (much like a subway) and then they send it through a toaster looking deal - (like Quiznos)! I actually had my first experience of this concept pizza at the Washington DC Ronald Reagan Airport at a place called '& Pizza'. Zablong seemed a bit bigger and more filing but the crust and sauce were not quite as good. The atmosphere and Vibe in Zablong was very hip. The wall was brick and had a cool painted mural and there where sharpies on each table and you could write on the wall.",

The following pizzas were ordered:   The Vampire Slayer The Southern Comfort The Greek Philosopher  The Meathead  All of the pizzas were absolutely tasty. However, The Southern Comfort pizza knocked me out! It is a delicious mix of cheese, corn and yes, PORK BELLY BACON!*insert smile*...I am not even really a bacon eater. But, this bacon right here? Perfect. Add carmelized onions and green peppers with a BBQ drizzle, and you have an award-winning pizza...okay, a bit subjective, but surely on someone's top ten pizza list somewhere (mine included)  All pies were 9.29 (1.00 extra for gluten free) and you can get all the toppings you want.  The staff was extremely helpful and patient towards people who probably should have googled the online menu before making life decisions in the pizza line, lol...just saying  The vibe is laid back. Seating is indoor and outdoor. However, it is small. But, on a nice day, you can picnic in Romare Bearden park across the street...or bring it home and try to fight the urge of not touching before you get to your house, lol...",

    "text": "I was excited to finally be able to try Zablong when I had to go into the office one day.  The concept is similar to Uncle Maddio's, but that is where the similarities end.  Zablong has lots of available bases, like the traditional tomato, as well as pesto, mushroom truffle, and several others.  Their topping choices are also vast, like the less customary pork belly, shrimp, and ghost pepper salami.  Their pizzas are long and rectangular, and they appear bigger than the standard personal sized pizza.  I had enough leftover for my husband and I to each have several slices another night.    You can either choose a preset pizza, or choose an unlimited number of toppings for just a few pennies more than $10 (including tax).  I chose the latter option, with a mushroom truffle base, and spinach, roasted red peppers, artichokes, pork belly, arugula, and a red pepper oil.  While you wait your turn to pay, your pizza is baked.  This is a very efficient process, and your pizza will be ready by the time you make it to the register.  I promise, the wait isn't more than 10 minutes from start to finish.  The most important thing is the taste.  Zablong's pizza is fantastic.  I brought several coworkers with me, and we all loved their pies.    Service is friendly here, and I'll definitely return.  What a great addition to Latta Arcade!",
