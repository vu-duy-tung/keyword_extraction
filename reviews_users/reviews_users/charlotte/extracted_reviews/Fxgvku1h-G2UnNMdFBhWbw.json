One had the special of the day, stuffed cabbage rolls, and the other, chicken fried steak with white gravy (both with 2 sides).  We started with a cup of the vegetable soup of the day.  Everything was very reasonably priced considering the large portions and the food was very good.  Servers were extremely nice and helpful.  The restaurant was clean. We saw folks eating breakfast, appetizers, burgers, or just salads and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. We will be back.",

    "text": "Insanely fast service, very friendly people and great prices. I want to give it four stars for those very reasons but all in all, I think this place is a solid three. My wife and I ate at this place twice and this is what we had:  Souvlaki Pita with fries. The souvlaki was seasoned nicely and the tzatziki was great. Although the pita's were not made in house it was very, very soft. Great pita sandwich. The fries were average. It also came with a cup of veggie soup (soup of the day) that was very good. This plate is a win.   Open face roast beef plate. I believe the mashed potatoes were instant but my wife enjoyed it and that is what mattered. I tried a bite of the roast beef with bread and gravy and it was good. This is more of a comfort food plate and one that I would recommend if you want something more bland. Don't get me wrong, it has flavor, but it is just simple.  Baked spaghetti with meat sauce. This was a huge plate of pasta smothered in melted cheese. It was good but not by any means traditional Italian. It came with bread and a salad and the salad was good.  Last but not least, 8oz ribeye with a baked potato & salad. My wife got the red French dressing which they said was made in house and my wife loved it. She really enjoyed the steak as well.   Bottom line, this place has good food not great food but the portions are big, the price is low and it is open 24hrs. This place would be a regular late night spot for me if I lived here.",

OR  2-It's past 11pm and most other things in Charlotte have stopped serving food.  It's a pretty typical diner. Outdated decor but lots of booths. The menu is a decent size. Lots of Greek and Italian options in addition to the breakfast menu. They have a few vegetarian options,  but not many.  I really love the fried squash here! It's their shining star! And the servers are always sweet and helpful.  The rest of the food quality really depends on who the cook is that night. I've had omelettes at Skyland that I could have done flips over, but other times they are dry and lackluster.",

I saw this place and since I love diners, especially mom & pop types, I thought I'd give it a chance.  The place was about 1/4 full with clientele from all walks of life.  The waitress/hostess quickly greeted and sat me.    I ordered an evening special for about 7.99 that came with a meat, 2 sides, bread and soup; but was disappointed they were out of their complimentary soup.  The waitress did make it up to me and she provided cheerful and fast service.  I would definitely return next time I'm in the Queen City and definitely recommend it.",

Staff was friendly; service was rather fast, given that there were only 8 people in the entire restaurant.  Would have given one star without the kindness.

It's a 24-hour spot mostly (I think it's closed Sunday late night through Monday morning).  I used to come here during the wee early morning hours after a night of partying like a rockstar.  Lately I've been here more for their dinner blue plates.    The food here is typical home-cooking.  Fried livers have enough to be shared (don't ewww me!).  Cabbage rolls are good, but it's only on Fridays (or is it Saturdays?).  I personally don't care for their mac & cheese (it's dry and not too flavorful). Cabbage & oven potatoes are my favorites.  Fried apple sticks as a side can be consumed as a dessert :)  The best part of eating dinner here is the complimentary cup of soup.  I'm a soup addict.  The weirdest thing here is their YELLOW gravy, I swear it glows!  I was a bit taken back by it, but I needed gravy for my turkey & dressing last night, so I hope I am not turning any yellow-er today (lol, Asian joke).  And to be fair, the ladies that work here aren't rude all the time.  In fact mostly they're very southern diner nice.  I give them 4-stars because it's a reliable & affordable place to eat.  They don't care if you sit there all night (and I have, studying).",

The food was not good.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla, without the chicken, and some fries.  The quesadilla was mushy, tasteless with very little seasoning, and just bland.  The fries--you could get those anywhere; they are nothing to rave about.  My BF had the turkey and dressing and he didn't complain (too much) about it, but he's likely echo my comments.  It seems they lack food quality.  I normally would not have given this place another thought, but we were right there and we were hungry so we figured, 'Why not?'  They really have to improve the food quality; that likely wouldn't encourage me to return, but for others who like good ole Southern cooking, they'll probably be looking for more. It just didn't come close to meeting my expectations.",

I got the chopped beefsteak with onions and gravy. The beef was pounded flat and done crispy which I loved! Very good flavor profile too. Came with fries which were decent.  Dad got the BLT, fries and a cup of soup. The soup was a veggie soup and was VERY good.   Waitress was a tad \"crusty\" but efficient.

The waitress was very attentive: making sure we had drink refills before we even finished the first (which went over very well with my husband).  The food was excellent.  THe food portions were huge (I didn't finish the plate) and I was able to take the rest home to eat at the hotel later.  And the prices were super cheap.  The only reason that I don't give this rating 5 stars is because of the hostess...  Maybe she was having an off day.... She pretty much ignored us when we walked through the door even though there was no one else around, we had to speak to her first before she acknowledged us.  And even then there was no \"Hey\", \"How you doin?\" Nothin. Just \"How many?\"  (There's still no one else around...) After we told her \"2\", she just walked off... No \"right this way\", \"follow me\" Nothin......   Needless to say our mood wasn't dampered for long, the rest of the experience was perfect.",

Well, at least that's how I found out about it.  I've heard of it before but my lack of patience persuaded me to finally visit and I'm glad I did.  Standard family style dining approach here with BLT's, steak and eggs and breakfast served all day.  Awesome.   I had the meat omelet and sides of bacon and sausage.  It hit the spot and was to our table in under 15 minutes.  At 2:00 am that's all you really require.    Don't expect much in terms of decor here.  It's a throwback to the 80's for the most part and easy to tell.  Who cares?  The downside of this location, is it's location relative to uptown for me but totally worth the cab ride if you ask me.",

I was glad our server was efficient, friendly, and extremely accommodating. She anticipated our needs, which is so rare these days. Ordinarily, we have to request extra things for our toddler (i.e highchair, extra plate, cup with a lid), but our server had these items out to us before we even thought to ask.

I have been coming here since high school and I will be 40..oops...lol..telling my age;-) I have always enjoyed coming here because everyone is always so nice and, they make you feel like family. When ever I come home to visit this is one of the places I enjoy eating at. Let me tell you...if you guys are ever in Charlotte to visit or already live in Charlotte, I encourage you to check out Skyland Diner. I was there yesterday and ordered the veggie plate. I chose the 4 item plate. Since I really love their squash, I always ask them to fry them hard for me. This is what I ordered with cabbage. If you order the squash try them with their homemade ranch dressing as a dipping sauce. You will enjoy them. Prices are reasonable and you get large portions of food. I have also had their stuffed cabbage rolls which are only available on their Saturday menu. They are very good and filling. They give you two big cabbage rolls. Check out Skyland Diner  when you have the chance;-) Many blessings to you all;-)",

Bacon had a horrible aftertaste.  Felt like someone searched out the cheapest, lowest quality breakfast meats they could find.  -Pancakes were cold.  The table-side, room temperature butter, already at the table; didn't melt.    Hashbrowns were barely cooked and weren't crisp at all.  ***For final bill of $16.94 (WHICH ISN'T CHEAP BTW!) before tip, I feel ripped off and duped.

I arrived on time and waited patiently in line because there were other customers waiting to be cashed out, waiting on their order, or both like I was. Waited about 8 to 10 minutes in line waiting for someone to tell me if it was ready or when to pay. Front desk came back with three orders, mine being one of them. If it was ready, I don't understand why it took long for them to cash me out if it was already ready. Came home which is approximately 4 minutes away and the food was cold. I ordered chicken parmigiana and a tuna melt. The chicken parmigiana came with watery meat sauce that was just not good at all. It was also cold. It tasted like how it looked like. The tuna melt was not the best either, but the fries were soggy and cold. Called the store to complain and even offered to bring back the food to prove I wasn't lying. The lady who picked up ended up being the front desk and was absolutely rude. I did not attempt to offend her in any way and was just simply trying to fix my order or reorder something else. She called me a liar and said the food was probably cold because I live far. Like I said before I live approximately 4 minutes. She also called me a liar when I said that I come there sometimes and says she's never seen me before. I've ordered plenty times in the past and never had an issue with the food. The front desk has always been rude, but I've always ignored it until now simply because I would only see the lady when it came to pay and ask for my order. I have worked in customer service in the past and I know exactly how a customer or even a human being should be treated. That was the worst. To be called a liar when I have nothing to gain from it except for my order to be fixed. I was willing to bring my order back to the location but I refuse to go back to a place that treats their customers less than.",

We recently came here for breakfast and it was very busy - I am from out of town so I am not sure if it is always like that but we ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table. Once we sat our waitress was very flustered and not very attentive.  I ordered the Feta Cheese Omelette and was disappointed. The egg was very dry and the omelette was broken in many places. The water also had an interesting earthy taste that I was not a fan of. The hash-browns were delicious however.   Maybe I just went on a busy day at a busy time but, my first impression was not the best.",

And I couldn't think of a better way to start my birthday than with a big breakfast at one of my favorite spots. I really love Skyland Restaurant. It's locally owned, not at all fancy, and just one of the best bargains in Charlotte. Graham had a Belgian waffle and a side of livermush, and I had scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and livermush. For about $5.00. You can't beat that!  And breakfast was perfect. I hate runny eggs. HATE them. And these were absolutely perfect. They were just the right texture and had a ton of flavor. And the biscuit is one of the best I had while I was home. Everything was delicious, the service was insanely fast and I can't wait to go back again the next time I'm home.",

After paying for our food, he so kindly helped take all of the food out to my car, without me asking should I mention. After eating, we all knew we'd be back. The food was absolutely delicious and had large portions! Thank you Skyland for the wonderful food and absolutely amazing service, it is truly appreciated!",

At almost 1 AM while laid over from a delayed flight I hit them up because it was walking distance from the hotel. I had not eaten anything for half the day with flight issues and probably anything would have tasted good, but they did better than good.  This restaurant is not far from the Four Points Hotel and they recommended it since everything else had long closed except for the strip joints and the 24 hour Skyland Family Restaurant. I really did not care, I was just so starved and needed FOOD!  I walked the couple minute trek and found the restaurant easily. The sidewalk was clear and there was actually business at this time of the morning. It was hard to get a vibe for the area since everything was dark, but there were other businesses within sight. I walked through the doors and was immediately greeted by a woman who seated me at a booth. Not long after a male waiter came by and offered coffee, water and a menu. Within what seems seconds drinks were on the table. The coffee was solid.  When the waiter came back with drinks I took no time to let him know that I was exhausted and just needed to eat, but preferred breakfast and asked for a recommendation. Some sort of combo with eggs, meat, another side and pancakes were offered. I decided on sausage patties and grits to accompany the meal. The waiter was friendly and it was refreshing after a really bad day at the airport.  I took a look around the dining room and it was set up with booths on the exterior walls. and interior middle. Seating capacity was pretty good and from what I could see it was tidy. There were various wall hangings which made it feel more comfortable. It was a standard diner place I guess, I was too tired to remember more details.   My breakfast came out so fast I thought it had to be a mistake and someone elses. But oh no, they rushed it through because I said how hungry I was and boy was it appreciated. The food smelled great and I was ready to dig in, but which first. Well I hit up the grits off the bat, something I don't often order. They were delicious, but so was everything and temperature was nice and hot.  My waiter checked up on me twice and provided a coffee refill.  My area was cleared quickly of dirty dishes upon finishing and the check was in hand to check out. I found the bill to be almost a mistake, it was so reasonable for the amount of food. The woman up front when paying was also friendly and we chatted a few minutes about all the wrestling memorabillia on the wall. The owner is a HUGE fan of wrestling. So, if anyone wants to talk wrestling come in during the day and he will bend your ear off I imagine.   I have no idea about the rest of the menu, but my meal was definitely quality. The service was about as good as you could possibly get. The place was clean and they offer 24 hour dining which was a bonus for me. I can imagine there lunch and dinner meals are pretty darn good too! The pies in the case as I headed out looked yum. They are doing this right at the Skyland.",

My daughter and I both opted for breakfast and were quickly served large portions and as much coffee as we could drink. My cheese and mushroom omelet had plenty of both.

I have been here more times than I can count and the experience is always the same. To be honest, I've only visited during the 12am-3am window. We come after a night out in uptown when you don't want to grab drive through food and you still want to continue the night with your friends because it's the only place that can accommodate late night tables of 6-8 people. Everyone is always friendly but you have to have some patience when waiting on your food. Everyone can come here because there are tons of choices, breakfast, Greek, your typical diner food and things that I'm always surprised about like baked spaghetti.  I love their Gyro plate or their biscuits and gravy!!   One thing I know is True, if I am looking for a place to sit down and eat at any time of the night and everyone can find something for them.

It was so tough, dried out and no taste that there was no way to eat it. I told the waitress and she went to the manager and told her. Waitress said she would be there in a minute which she never can after 30 minutes. I told the lady at the cash register (manager) and she looked at me like I was crazy. She asked if I told the waitress and I said yes and I watched her tell you. She never offered to do anything but take my money for food my dog wont eat.   So that is the last time I go here or tell anyone to go there",

After being seated I noticed that our waitress had very poor hygiene. Her nails were black under them and her chipped nail polish ended up in my food when served. By no means do I generalize or stereotype someone based on the way they look however, every server with an exception of a few of the young girls look like crackheads we're serving my food... The food came out fast however,I lost my appetite based on the uncleanliness of my waitress.  Gross.",

    "text": "Off the beaten path but excellent find.  This morning I was looking for a place for Brunch after Church and in the listings, I came across the Skyland Family Restaurant.  Knew about it because it's a long time Charlotte Staple but had never made it there.  After Church let out at 10:30 in Davidson, we drove down and got there right at 11:00 which made my wife very happy.  She's not a Breakfast fan and at this time, they were transitioning to the Lunch Menu.  It's a typical Greek/American Diner open 24/7 and the menu if focused on Comfort Food.  We were a bit shocked when we pulled in and the parking lot was packed but when we got inside, we were immediately seated.  Nice interior with typical Greek decor. Service was fair because our server kept forgetting things like I ordered unsweetened tea with lemon  and it was served without lemon.  The complimentary bread was forgotten till it was asked for etc.  My wife ordered the Veal Parmesan with Spaghetti which came with a House Salad.  I had the Country Style Steak with White Gravy, Fried Okra and Potato Salad.  Each meal started out with the complimentary cup of the Greek Chicken and Rice Soup.  My wife loved her Veal Parmesan but the red sauce on the Spaghetti was a bit bland. The Salad was very good and everything on it was fresh.  My Country Fried Steak was very good but the Fried Okra was a bit on the greasy side and the Potato Salad was good but a bit heavy on the mustard which overpowered the side.  All in all, very good and a nice place for scoring some good comfort food.",

    "text": "This was my second time at Skyland. Went for breakfast with a friend around 11am on a Friday. There was plenty of parking and it wasn't too busy. At that time of day, the demographic was older.   I ordered the Skyland breakfast. I was excited to find out that you can choose between pancakes or french toast even though the menu doesn't say you can choose one or the other. The only downside is you can't get 1/2 french toast and 1/2 pancakes. I requested scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns and french toast. I wasn't really blown away by anything I ate. The eggs weren't scrambled, needed salt & pepper and were too soft for my liking. The turkey sausage had a weird taste and I ended up not finishing it. The french toast and hash browns were decent but I wouldn't go back just for their french toast or hash browns. The best things about the restaurant were the prices, quantity of food and the server. The server was super sweet and made sure we were taken care of. Also,  Would I go again? Hmmmm...I wouldn't make a special trip to go but I wouldn't be opposed to going if someone else wanted to try it out. I'd try ordering something else though. Their fish looked good.",

I'm not sure if they were canned or not but they were delish. I really hope they were not canned because their menu says \"fresh vegetables\" The rice and gravy were ok. NOT ENOUGH GRAVY! The gravy just sat on top, it didn't penetrate the rice like I would have liked it.   I would definitely return. I ordered through Door Dash but in the future, I'm going to try to go in and visit the actual location so I can get the entire feel. That will tell me everything I need to know!   I GIVE IT A 3.7",

After 1.5 hours of waiting, that food delivery service calls me and says \"Skyland tells us you called to cancel your order but didn't cancel it in the app\". I never called to cancel, they never called me to say they couldn't make it or apparently didn't want to. By the time all of this happened it was approximately 1:20am and too late for me to get food elsewhere because everything was no longer delivering (and I can't eat a full pizza alone nor do I want to pay for one). So I'm stuck at work very hungry and pretty mad. This was a Wednesday night, not a weekend when it's busier at the restaurant and I could possibly understand them not wanting to make my food.",

We have been to this restaurants a few times since we moved to the area and although there is nothing particularly special about it, we like the convenience of the location.  Last night we decided to eat dinner there. It was about 8:30PM. We ordered Jalepeno Poppers as an appetizer. They came out pretty fast, so I assumed they were microwaved. My husband took a bite of one and it was so hot that it burned the skin off a portion of his lip.  When he went to speak to the hostess, she showed no concern and asked him if HE had anything to put on it, but never offered anything from their first aid kit.   He returned to the table and our waitress came over and asked if we had an issue with the appetizer. When we told her the issue she said that they never receive complaints and that we should of know they would be hot because they deep fry them. Essentially, blaming him for the burn.  The whole situation escalated and we were continually treated very poorly. Customer service was non existent.  We decided to leave and we were charged for the meal that we didn't eat. We went back in to get the paid for meals, but were afraid to eat them because after how we were treated we weren't taking any chances. We trashed the food.  Oh, and their moto is...THANK YOU For Your Support, Without YOU There is no \"US\".",

There were people picking up takeout orders and others eating in.   Prices were very reasonable. I ordered a \"senior breakfast\" (scrambled egg, bacon, hash browns and biscuits).  It was more than my appetite could handle.  Husband chose 2 eggs, grits, toast and ham. The slice of ham filled the plate.  Refills on the coffee and pop were always replenished without having to ask.   Needless to say, we will be returning on our next visit to the area.

As in, it's delicious when you're intoxicated but not good other wise. Went Sunday morning at my fellow diners request. I ordered the Olympian omelette , which is the same thing I used to order . It used to be delicious and loaded with feta cheese. Today it was extremely dry, came out in a circle like it had been cooked in a mold and packed with hash browns. I literally ate less than an 8th of it it was so bad. The hash browns that came with it were good. The biscuit was good but very heavy. The place wreaked of smoke which I don't understand since you can't smoke there. I really won't be going back unless I need a late night snack. I'm not a fancy girl and don't need a fancy breakfast but the food was just terrible . I honestly should have sent it back but I hate to be that girl. If I go back, I will definitely change my order.

I think the experience would've been better if I went during the day. But overall they have a good choice of food on their menu.",

    "text": "I've been a Skyland fan even before I moved over to the south side of Charlotte. I work nights and pretty much been a night owl most of my life so I have a special place in my heart for 24/7 restaurants you can get a decent meal at outside of the chain places (Waffle house, IHOP, Denny's) and late night fast food can be downright depressing. It's a greek style, family owned\\operated type place so I usually see the same familiar faces no matter when I choose to visit but it's usually late a night after a night of roaming around on the town and i get an attack of the munchies. They have both a breakfast & dinner menu with great variety and always available at any time. Prices aren't necessarily super cheap but fairly reasonable for the amount of food they give you is certainly worth it. I tend to be in a breakfast mood when I dine there but i've had many selections off both menu's and have been satisfied with everything I've picked. Word to the wise, if you don't want to be bothered with potential rowdy patrons you may not want to dine there after 2am especially on the weekends you will run into alot of after the club patrons not too mention the place gets pretty packed. Still get pretty solid service even when it gets busy and police usually dine and hang around quite a bit so they usually take care of the edgy element if it happens to arise. Not the most flashy place on the inside, a few tv's nice sized dinning area, never really have a trouble getting a seat. Not the most intimate setting for a date but a good hangout spot to meet up with friends. I hope the establishment continues to stick around for years to come :-)",

I placed my order with a server that was welcoming and friendly without being annoying.  She seemed to know exactly when my coffee needed refilling and was never intrusive.  I had the meatlovers omelette.  HUGE. Comes with toast and hash browns. A lot of food.  As for value:  Even with a generous tip you'll spend less than the same at IHOP.

On Sunday nights when absolutely nothing is open after 10pm, it's your best, if only, bet for a quick hot meal that's not fast food.  Not that it's any healthier.  But you can sit down to eat and they have a wide selection on their menu.  That said, eating here will very quickly remind you that you are firmly located in the South.  Not every restaurant in town has to be metro chic, and ruffians can be found in any city.  But be prepared to deal with loud, ignorant people, especially in their mid 20's with no manners and no respect for you, the restaurant or themselves any night of the week.

Not only do I make a good breakfast, but I have had more than my fair share out, so I take breakfast pretty seriously. At Skyland, I was not overwhelmed, but certainly not disappointed.  I love that it is 24/7 breakfast service, which makes it better than a lot of places, in my opinion. I had grits, toast, and a veggie omelette. The grits were good--pretty thick.  I generally prefer runnier grits, but I nearly polished these off with no problem. The omelette was alright. Not well-seasoned, but did have tons of veggies that seemed pretty fresh.  I also stole a few onion rings from my friend, which were like normal onion rings you would find anywhere.  I got a chicken parmesan sub to go for my husband.  He said he would definitely have it again, then went on a long tirade about how difficult the 5-star system is.  He decided that 7-out-of-ten stars would be perfect for this sub.  I stopped listening after that.   My friends got the same sub--an Italian sandwich, with really thick sliced salami and sausage. One loved it, one did not.  So, just make sure you like thickly-sliced sausage before ordering.  I heard that the banana pudding was also excellent (though I hate fake banana taste, so I wouldn't touch it.)  The atmosphere was enjoyable, if only for the kitsch factor.  Our waitress was attentive, but not annoying, which I always enjoy.  I will definitely be going back for breakfast.",

I honestly didn't think a restaurant would be bad enough to ruin eggs. Table next to us had the same issue, overheard them complaining. If I was confident that the waitress would get the manager in a timely fashion I would have asked, but I really didn't feel like spending another 30 min waiting.

We usually get breakfast; or for lunch the cheeseburger deluxe and I'll get the gyro. Well, I thought I would change up and my husband got his usual cheeseburger deluxe and I ordered a cold roast beef sandwich on white bread. That seemed to be a problem because she asked several times if I wanted it on toast and then a bun. What's so hard about white bread?  It had to be the most awful meal both of us have had in a while. I specifically asked the waitress ( whom I've never seen before and was pretty abrupt) if the roast beef was rare and she unequivocally said yes. Sadly, the bread, although not toasted, obviously was under the heat lamp and was warm and NOT rare but actually warm. The slices were thick cut and grisly. My husband could not eat his cheeseburger as he said it was so overcooked. Specifically asked for well done fries, which I won't hold them accountable for since NO PLACE I ever ask for well done fries for ever gets it (except Chik fil la). When I tasted the lettuce on my sandwich and then his separated from the sandwich, it actually tasted like soap. We may go for breakfast if we are in the area and hungry for breakfast, but I will never go back for lunch under any circumstances. I'm pretty sad about it since it was a staple for us.",
