It was our first visit here and the restaurant has lovely decor and beautiful rustic wooden tables. However most of the plates that were on the table were not clean and then once the waitress removed them to switch them out, I noticed at least 3 sticky/not clean areas on the table. NOT acceptable in any restaurant that has the kind of prices Basil Thai has. I chose not to say anything as we had company and I did not want to make a scene. The food was good and we will go back because of that but please, hire staff that has an eye for a clean table.",

May visit again if in the area but wouldn't make a special trip to eat here.",

I used to go to JoJo's Chinese which was housed in the same location. We had a party of 7 - and we ordered some appetizers to start...which was the Chicken and Beef Sate and the Egg rolls.  They were okay...just okay...Not anything to write home about...The condiment tray was nice...some great green Thai chili's in vinegar! We ordered Hot sake..but Alas..it was not hot..and it took forever to come to our table. ..It was weak and unremarkable. My entree was the Basil Barramundi, which was a great fish that was not the least bit fishy..tasted very fresh and filleted beautifully. The problem is they put the same scoop of Thai Vegetables on every Chef Specialty that comes out of the kitchen and it just wets down the entree. It did not need to have that ladled on . It was on my husbands Red Curry Duck and also my daughters Basil Thai Duck and my Barramundi . The atmosphere is nice...lots of tables but I truly think the food at the one Uptown is better and the Kitchen Manager needs to rethink a few things.....Thai - Out...",

The bartender was actually the manager for the evening. There seemed to a very steady stream of people picking up takeout. Dinner was great. Basil roll appetizer was light and refreshing. I would recommend any of the three locations but this one is a nice option if you want to avoid the hassle of uptown parking and traffic. They also have an outdoor patio that I am sure is nice in the spring and summer.",

Plus their pad thai comes standard with chicken and shrimp :) Entree portions are more than enough for one person so we always share and have leftovers anyway. When dining in they bring a spice mixture to the table with three levels of heat to customize your dish. Full bar and decent prices so I really can't find anything bad to mention. Hope you enjoy!!!",

Recently, we made a reservation for a bday dinner for a party of 6 on a weeknight. When 2 of us arrived on time, they still needed to clean our table. Within 5 min, our party had arrived except for one person (a new mother who had a newborn at home and was running a little late- but on her way). They refused to seat us. They were unapologetic. The manager kept saying it was his owners policy and he couldn't put his job on the line. I understand rules, but come on. 5/6 people were there and one person was on her way.  1.  You should state your policy over the phone when taking the reservation for a party of 6.  2.  What is the point of being a manager if you cant make a common sense decision that having one last person walk in 5-10 min after you seat everyone is better than losing a party of 6 on a weeknight?  Aside from their unwillingness to accommodate, their attitude was unfriendly.  Needless to say, I was disappointed in the manager and his hostess.  I met the owner a couple of times when they first opened and the only explanation i can think of is that this restaurant must be under a new owner.",

The dining area is very open, however, the noise level was low so we didn't have any problem carrying on a conversation while eating.  The decor is very nice, but the atmosphere is casual.  And the chairs are super comfortable.   There were three in our party.  We started with the fried wontons...talk about addictive.  The wontons were small in size, but a perfect portion to share between three people.    My husband started his meal with a bowl of the Tom Kha Gai.  Our waitress warned that the soups served at dinner are meant to be shared between two people, so he ordered the soup anticipating to take home leftovers, which we did.  The only flaw with the soup was that there was a lot of broth and not a lot of vegetables.  Other than that it had a very nice aroma and was very flavorful.    For our entrees we ordered the Pad Prik, the Basil Tilapia, and the Pad Thai.  We chose to share all three.  The sauce for the Pad Prik was dynamite.  It had enough spice that it didn't need anything added to it.  The Basil Tilapia was very mild but wonderful flavor.  The Pad Thai was also mild, we asked for a medium spice but it still needed a kick.  They offered three spices: Siracha; Chili Powder, and a Garlic Chili Paste.  The Garlic Chili paste was a wonderful addition to the Pad Thai.  Our waitress was very helpful and attentive.  All and all we had a wonderful experience and are happy to recommend Basil Thai to anyone.  We will definitely be back.",

It is located right in the Stonecrest Shopping Center and right next to Marble Slab and Smashburger (where the old China Bistro used to be).    I'm going to write this review a little differently than I usually do because of the circumstances.  This Basil had things that I LOVED and things that I hated.  And obviously the LOVED items were just that good that it drove my 4 star rating.  But here is the list of \"must get\" and the \"pass\":  Must get:   Fried Wontons:  Crispy, flavorful, with a creamy finish.  Sweet sauce was excellent! Pad Thai:  If you are a Thai place and screw this up.... Pack your things...  You're done.   This was delicious and just the right texture and flavor! Crispy Duck w/ Red Curry Sauce:   Chef Specialty and it was PHENOMINAL!!  Crispy succulent duck with a perfect curry sauce to give it a little heat.  I would absolutely recommend that you order this.   Hendricks Martini:  Mixed with some saki and cucumber.  Refreshing!  Pass: Basil Garlic (Beef):  Very boring and plain.  It just tasted like a ton of garlic with some bland beef sprinkled in Dark and Stormy:  Bland rum cocktail  Enjoy!    Ian M.",

Then I got a Massaman curry and it wasn't very thick and it had very strong flavors (in a good way) then my sister got a Pud Woo Sen and it was also very good and had a lot of good flavors. The service is also pretty good, we weren't ever just waiting to get someone to help us. If you're in the area it's definitely worth a try, however I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, it is good but not good enough for me to pass three other Thai restaurants on the way there.",

I was worried about getting a table since they're not on Open Table and there was no mention of reservations on their website, but we got right in.   I don't remember much about the inside of Jojo, but my friend said the layout is basically the same. Much like the uptown location, it's a warm shade of light green inside with plush-looking chairs, dark brown tables, and flowers/bamboo sprinkled around. We were seated at a two-person booth, but most of the dining area was tables.  Our waitress was really helpful, steering us in a good direction to start with the Nam Sod ($6.95) instead of the Lard. We got the chicken version, and it was so refreshing! I didn't realize they were technically lettuce wraps, so I just ate the inside.  For dinner, I was boring and went with the pad thai ($15.95), which is a little sweeter than some, but I like that. My friend got the green curry ($14.95) and said it was really good.  We each got two glasses of wine, split the appetizer, and my bill was right around $38 with tip - not too shabby! Great addition to the Ballantyne area.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. The manager was helping the host sit tables when we first walked in and when a table opened up she almost skipped me and my girlfriend and was going to give our table to someone else when we had waited WAY longer than the other couple. And no, the other couple did not have a reservation either. They ask when you first walk in. Then she realizes that she is skipping us because my friend speaks up and proceeds to sit us down instead. The server was nice at first however after our food was delivered she only checked on us ONCE. We waited about 15 minutes after we finished our food until I had to get up TWICE to get my check. First I told the host that we needed our checks. We just wanted to pay for our food and leave. 5 minutes later, NOTHING. Then I see the manager walk by I tell her what is going on. Another 5 minutes later, she FINALLY brings us our checks not even offering a courtesy dessert or discount for our terrible experience. She just drops the check on the table and walks away. Is that appropriate manager behavior? At least an apology. The only reason I tried the one here in Charlotte is because I had Basil first in Charleston and fell in love. The one here in Charlotte though, SUCKS. The food is also not as tasty as the other location in SC. So disappointing.",

    "text": "My best friend and I decided to have a little girls' night of thai food & cocktails and she suggested we try this place out. Basil is located in the extremely suburban enclave of Stonecrest but don't hold that against them too much.  Reservations were made for a Friday evening (5-8-15) and we arrived with plenty of seating options to choose from since it wasn't busy. They have a nice outdoor patio that is flanked with lighting so that it a great option on a nice night. Even though it was beautiful night, we chose to sit inside.  Basil is decorated incredibly chic with an impressive entryway and I even found myself having floor-envy. I love a dark wood floor!  But I digress....As I waited for my friend to arrive, I heard a couple of other diners mention how good the food is there. Once my friend arrived, we asked our waiter to suggest a cocktail. I was having a difficult time deciding because they have a list of yummy-sounding cocktails. Since we were going the classic pad thai route, he suggested the pineapple mojito because it goes well with the combination of flavors. Once it came out, I had to pace myself to not suck it down so quickly because it was so good. I love a mixed-well cocktail and the folks at Basil Thai know a thing or two about doing that well.  I ordered my chicken pad thai on the mild heat spectrum and once it came out, I wish I had increased the heat a bit more. I love a little spice. The dish was very good, so good that I found myself craving more of it over the weekend. I had shoveled all it down so there was no chance of leftovers. With this pad thai, I found the ingredients were very fresh which brought out the traditional flavors of the meal more.  Overall, Basil is a good spot for celebrations, date nights, etc or to grab a drink if you find yourself tired of the soccer mom scene in Stonecrest.",

The lighting is cool and soothing and best ambiance for a date night. The furnishings and chairs are also really exquisite like a really expensive restaurant! The menu is mostly a basic Thai menu with some special dishes on the center page (which costs 25$+, not within my price range). We made some entree orders of Basil Chicken, Vegetable Delight and Cashew Nut which came in quite some time. We were given a common bowl of rice to share which you can ask for more if needed. My dish was particularly bland and without salt. I didn't want to humiliate the waitress so just asked for Salt but it was still not very nice and disappointing dish. I may come here again but will still hold back because of that one tasteless and saltless Basil Thai Chicken I still remember.",

We ordered the Thai chicken wings which were my favorite thing we ordered. They were flavored well, crispy and had a good dipping sauce. I'm a sucker for anything with lime juice and fish sauce. Also ordered the sum tom. Just okay, really not that flavorful. Pad-see-u definitely should have had more broccoli in it. Just a few little nuggets among a valley of noodles for $15.95 made me regretful for even wanting to come. Truth be told, I only picked Thai because I really was hoping to get some Thai boat noodle soup and they didn't even have it.  Our server was nice and did a wonderful job with making sure that everything was good.  If you ask for a chili tray, don't expect what you would typically get from a Thai place but instead 3 little servings of Sriracha, sambal, and dried red pepper.  Our server didn't charge us for our drinks and maybe that is because she heard me complaining about the nasty ass orange juice she gave my son. Either way, that was kind of her.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Basil Thai uptown a couple of times and had great experiences there, so I was excited when I learned they were opening a location in StoneCrest.   I recently was at Polished getting a mani after work, and decided that instead of cooking dinner when I got home, I would just pick up some take-out instead.    I went over to Basil and placed an order to go and had a glass of wine at the bar while I waited. I forgot the name of the wine, but it was an Australian Sauvignon Blanc that was very quaffable.  It was either $8 or $9 for a glass, which is a typical price-point for that quality of wine in this area. The pour was somewhat generous, so that is a plus.   When it came time to order, I did not see Penang Curry, which is one of my favorite dishes at the Thai House.  I mentioned it to the bartender since I was placing my takeout order at the bar.  She commented that Penang Curry is \"not really Thai, it is more Indian\". Huh...really?  Not sure about that but I just let it drop, and ordered Red Curry with chicken instead.   My order was ready pretty quickly, so as soon as I finished my glass of wine, I went home to dig into dinner. Truthfully, I was a bit disappointed in it. They were not overly generous with the chicken and the red curry was ok, but a bit on the bland side. (I had ordered it as medium spicy, not mild.)  It contained bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and basil... but overall was not really that flavorful and did not satisfy my Thai craving.   I do think they are priced a little higher than some of the local competition - I think my total for 1 glass of wine and 1 entree was between $26-28.  I don't mind paying a little more if their food blew the others out of the water... but based on this visit, that is just not the case.   Unless they give me  a really compelling reason to go back, next time I have a craving for Thai, I will more likely go back to Bahn Thai instead.",

Amazing.  The service is where things start to get iffy. I've been here 3 different times over a pretty spread out period and it's the same story everytime we go. They are SLOW. the last time I went we almost left because it took 30 minutes, 30 minutes for someone to come take our drink order. And if you need a refill your out of luck. Also when the meal is done be prepared to wait for anyone to bring a check. We also never have a specific waiter when we go here. Maybe that's the problem. I think the manager took our drink order, they have a water person. Different people at our table everytime.  The problem is not being understaffed either. They seem to have a lot of servers standing around but not really doing anything. 4 or 5 hotestess.   Hopefully they can get this fixed and the service lives up to the food.",

This time around, the food/flavors were good. I order the same crispy red curry duck, the duck was cooked and more tender than the pervious. Also the spice was tack on! They could afford to put a little more sauce on the plate but it was fine nonetheless. Overall, glad that this particular Basil is not a bust; thankful it's closer to the homestead!",

The place  I love the contemporary decor with really cool lighting and statues everywhere.  I am by no means an expert but I thought they did a great job on this place.  Also loved that it very clean.  The food  I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the shrimp and rice.  Both were well done and had a great flavor.  All the ingredients tasted fresh which to me always make the food so much better.  Also came out hot which is a big plus.    The staff  Our waitress was great she was very attentive not sure my water ever went below half full!!  She was very funny and talked to us a few minutes.  That alone would bring me back to this place  The verdict This place is a win on every front including price.  I cant wait to come back a try more items on the menu.  The place alone is worth going to just to see the cool decor kudos to the owner!",

This soup looked like a dumping inside water, but it  tasted real good.  Been habitual of having food of various hues I found little hesitant to accept that this watery soup can test good.  We scape appetizer and ordered entrees. Basil with tofu and pad prik with chicken. My dish was basil, the little gravy it has was sweetened which I found hard to finish with uncooked brown rice. Second dish was too sweet-pad prik..the biggest setback was both the dishes were not warm at all..too cold that it was hard for us to finish with uncooked rice.  Somehow we finished tofu and chicken.. but overalls it was meh.. I wanted my first visit here to be special one but I think I need to wait until for some good stuff yet!!",

Seriously on the ginger mints - they're sort of life changing.  I've been to the Ballantyne and Uptown locations - both have a cozy atmosphere that's casual and conducive to sharing a meal with peeps you like.  I ordered the veggie delight with shrimp - it was mild and in a light brown sauce that was really flavorful.  Sometimes the veggie dishes at restaurants can be bland - this was not.  The veggies were fresh and there was a good variety of mushrooms, peas, broccoli and shrimp.  My mom ordered the papaya salad - which was spicy and delicious.  This is one of her favorite places to order the papaya salad (and she's tried a lot of them).  My dad ordered the red curry with chicken - and it had a nice, soothing heat that gets your blood pumping without sacrificing flavor.  Highly recommend Basil for a tasty time - but be sure to call and make a reservation if you can - they're busy during dinner time!",

The chicken satay was raw in the center. We chewed and spat it out but on one bothered to ask us what's wrong they food was just left at the table each time and the waiter quickly waited away without giving us a chance to re-mention the table or tell him the started was undercooked.   My husband had the fried rice, we were told by the waiter initially that it's the best in Charlotte. I've had better a simple take out restaurants.  I had the green curry it was ok. Nothing exceptional.  I do not recommend nor will I visit ever again.",

It has been a journey nailing down our favorite places to eat in the QC and when it came to Thai we were lost UNTIL we ran across Basil in UPTOWN. This new location is much closer to our home which is a plus and we made it a priority to check it out to see if it compared.  This place is pretty popular so it's best to call and make reservations in advance or be prepared to WAIT. I dislike the fact that they are NOT on OpenTable which is negative in my book as I like convenience and reservations at my fingertip. This goes for both locations.  The restaurant is pretty trendy and romantic at the same time. You can go with friends, colleagues, family or on a romantic date. This place allows for all of those scenarios and then some.  The food is very tasty from the apps to the main courses. We've had the fresh shrimp basil rolls and for our main course we had our usual \"BAsil Fish\". This dish is so flavorful and this location did not disappoint.",

My server apologetically returned with a half glass of wine for me, on the house.  I suppose if we had come earlier in the evening this would not have been an issue at all.

My youngest didn't even want to try it but at least my other kids will eat all of it for lunch tomorrow. Lol Prices are fair but some stuff is over priced.

The atmosphere is definitely more upscale than your typical Thai place. It makes it a nice place for a date night. My favorite dish is the Chicken Coconut soup. You must try it. It boasts flavors of chicken, coconut, cilantro, and lime. Normally I would not enjoy this mixture, but something about it makes it so satisfying. The Thai wings are fried very crispy and are accompanied by a fish sauce and lime sauce that is most intriguing. A good stand by is the pad thai. It is not the best I have had, but decent. You can adjust your spice level with the spices left on the table. Overall, one of the best Thai places in Charlotte.",

    "text": "First time here with my dining mate and another couple. Nice atmosphere, very attentive friendly service. Our Thai waitress willing to suggest and explain the menu. Menu features traditional as well as Thai specialties. Everything from soups, appetizers, salads, meat, poultry and seafood choices as well as vegetarian cuisine plus specialty desserts. We ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce, chicken coconut soup, main courses: Basil Duck, Pad Thai with shrimp,  and chicken with ginger sauce. Food came out hot, good portions, plated nicely. Menu on the pricey side. Everything was very tasty and delicious. Duck and chicken tender. We ordered low spicey  flavor. Especially apealing was   the soup and how it was presented ( flamed serving vessel ) plus  great flavor. So a very enjoyable dinner. We would come back again.",

Have been here a Couple of times and never impressed - again - the teenagers like it. However, after this experience will not be taking them again (they can spend their own money on it if they want). The service (while she was good) was extremely slow and the food was pricey and not worth the $$ for the taste. There are so many other better Thai Places in Charlotte for instance - right down the street in Blakeney.",

    "text": "In all this time here we finally got around to going Thai at Basil Thai.  The interior is huge.  I could envision parties or special occasion events being easily accommodated.  And it is more elegant atmosphere than most other of the Thai restaurants in the Charlotte area.  Menu does cover the waterfront so-to-speak, offering lots of variety.  Curries are only three, but we had the red which was just fine, loaded with beef (you can have other meats) and plenty of sauce to get soaked up by the rice.  The other two curries are green (with eggplant and green peas) and Masaman, which has potatoes.  Noodle dishes, stir fries, salads (that looked very large as they were carried by for other tables), soups (we had the yummy chicken coconut = excellent) and specials (which we highly recommend you try).  Spice is not a major part of their preparation, even if you ask for it to be spicy.  Instead, you get a selection of condiments, like the powder that is used, tiny REALLY HOT red peppers in liquid (?) and a smushed salsa of red peppers what goes really well with most all dishes and is tolerable heat-wise.  Nice wine list with plenty of by-the-glass selections.  Nice seafood items that are unique.  Service excellent.  A pleasure to come here.",

The setting is nice, special shout out to the plush chair seat that felt like sitting on cloud. The food left much to be desired.   I ordered shrimp and barrundi - and my shrimp was undercooked, and obviously undercooked just from the coloring of the shrimp. The other entrees we got: duck, fish, seafood stew were okay.  The desserts were disappointing to say the least. First of all they said the mango sticky rice was out of season. Seriously? I was just at Harris Teeter and there were mangos on sale. I don't think Basil Thai is a fancy place that calls only for specific mangoes imported from Thailand! I've had Bahn Thai mango sticky rice a month ago, and they didn't have any trouble making it \"off season\".   The fried ice cream was also disappointing. The dough was lukewarm; it tasted as if the balls were deep fried earlier and put in a fridge somewhere. We came here excited for the desserts and needless to say left quite disappointed.",

I like the fact that they put all four spice choices you usually get at a traditional Thai place on the table. The had Singha and the cook was fast. Thank you and well done. Bravo Zulu.",

We ordered Pad Thai, Basil Duck, and Basil. They were all SOOO good. We completely finished the Pad Thai (a bit smaller portion than others but DELICIOUS) and took the leftovers home.

    "text": "I have been coming to Basil for years.  Not necessarily this location but when they first opened the one on Church St.   This is about my 3rd time coming to this location and it is great every time.  TIP: Call ahead and make reservations, so that you can get seated as soon as you get there vs. waiting.  The atmosphere is cool, dim lighting, nice space between tables, you never feel like your sitting too close to the next table.  Our waitress Lynn was very friendly and pleasant, it took a while to get our drinks and take our order, but usually our wait time is reasonable, maybe they were short staffed the night we went, so I gave them a pass for this one.  Now on to our meal.  It was delicious as usual.  Appetizers:  Normally I get Egg Rolls (3 per serving) which are tasty, but decided to switch it up this time and got the Thai Chicken Wings and those things were good.  Not too spicy, just enough flavor and a decent size.  Entree: Shrimp Basil (Me) Chicken Cashew Nuts(Husband) I love the Shrimp Basil but then again I am a shrimp junkie and love anything shrimp.  You have to really screw it up for me not to like it.  The shrimp was nice, plump, delicious and cooked to perfection, didn't taste rubbery or like frozen shrimp.  Most it importantly it tasted FRESH. I also like the spice rack they have on the side, so that you can kick it up a notch or few if you like.  My husband's go to is the Chicken Cashew Nuts faithfully, every time, so that speaks for itself.    WARNING:  The Basil menu item is considered spicy, but I didn't think it was spicy at all, BUT I like spicy stuff so, you might want to take my warning of not spicy with a grain of salt.    The only thing I don't really care for from them even though I keep trying are their drinks.  For the life of me I can't remember the names of the ones I tried but didn't like any of them.  Not worth paying over $8 for a drink that's sub par.  I can tell you some of the ingredients in the drink - pineapple, mint, lime and of course alcohol.  The thing is mint and lime are tricky ingredients, you really have to put the right amount, so that they compliment each other, in this drink they were fighting for 1st place and I didn't even taste the pineapple, but the name of the drink had the word pineapple in it, so I thought the pineapple was going to be dominant but instead it took a back seat. The drink ended up being very tart, but minty at the same time.  In my opinion Basil is not a kid friendly restaurant, which is ok I don't need to take them with me everywhere I go .  Plus it's on the pricey side, so I would probably waste my money if I took them.  I'll wait a little longer until they can appreciate it.  All in all I am a BIG fan of Basil Thai's food, LOVE IT, drinks, meh not so much.  If you've been thinking about giving it a try, it's time to just go ahead and do it.",

    "text": "Definitely our first and our last time here.  The 2 stars is really for the food as the service was pathetic and I would have given them a 1 star.  We came in July 5th for my father's birthday.  We would have gone to Bahn Thai or Malaya Kitchen, but they were closed for the entire week.  My parents are strict vegetarians and it was brought to our server's attention.  He responded back as if he already knew.  We also had my 3 year old son with us, he fell asleep in the car so when we brought him in, we had to ask the server to switch our table to a booth so we could lay him down.    We ordered spring rolls, soup, and chicken wings for appetizers.  The rolls and soup came out, and actually taste great.    After eating all the apps, we ordered the main.  masaman curry with veggies and tofu for my parents, masaman curry with chicken for my wife and I, noodles with strictly veggies.     I had to ask the server about the wings. His comment:  \"Oh they come out with the main\".  Oh Really?  Just say you forgot dude, we would understand.  Don't make us feel dumb.  Anyway, this is issue 1.    Issue 2 - Issues with our order.  Masaman curry had no veggies except 1 piece of broccoli.  The noodles had eggs in them.  Vegetarians do not eat eggs.  And it had so much fish sauce, you might has well slap a flounder on top!  And our Masaman curry with chicken, the chicken was very chewy (over cooked).    Issue 3 - My Mom's fork fell on the floor, so she asked for another.  The server never brought one.  10 minutes later I had to get up and ask another server for one.  By this point we are thinking what's wrong with this guy?  Does he not like us???    Issue 4 -  No kid friendly menu whatsoever.  The noodles they served us were not at all kid friendly.    Issue 5 - By this time, the server had this hidden attitude, he hardly showed up to our table.  We waited and waited.  Mind you, we never brought any of the above items to the server's attention.  He was already unapologetic about the first couple things, there was really no point to say anything else to him.    I do wish I brought all these issues to the manager's attention, but what's the point, if simple issues like these can't be seen by the manager,  then there'a gotta be poor management too.   Look, I don't like writing bad reviews, but servers and restaurants that make themselves out to be better then the \"mom and pop\" competitors should get a rude awakening.  Please make some improvements to your business!",

We came here around 11:45 am and when we opened the door, it was locked. We saw people in there so we weren't sure what was going on. Another couple came behind us and tried to open the door too. Someone decided to call and a hostess answered. She told them about the door locked and we quickly saw the hostess unlock the door.   We got sat right away. The server was very pleasant and kind. I ordered the pad kee mao with beef and my friend ordered the pad see ew with tofu. The food came in a timely matter. We both got spice level \"hot\" but it wasn't hot at all. I had to put a ton of chili paste on it to add some heat. The noodles were cooked good and the beef was pretty tender. My only complaint is the price for lunch entrees. The meal and tip with a water was $15.   This wouldn't be my first choice for lunch because I feel like there are other thai restauraunts just as good if not better for a better price but this is a nice addition for ballantyne.",

The place was fully redecorated since my last visit (several years ago?), and felt like a brand new restaurant. Not as bright and fancy as before, but nice in a more conservative way...I'd say more American in decor. We stopped in for a late lunch, so got seated in a choice spot, and received attentive service from the waiter throughout the meal.  Now the food! Decided to try the \"Tom Kha Gai\" (Chicken Coconut) Soup for the first time...and sadly, it wasn't my thing. I expected it to have more of a Coconut taste, more smoother and sweeter...but it tasted more tarty than sweet and Coconutty. Even the small portion costed nearly 7 bucks, and I could barely finish one third of the bowl. As for the meal, I chose their \"Pad See Eu\", my typical go-to Thai dish. It was pretty good...but definitely not the best I've had. More than the food itself, I was more impressed with the classy presentation of both the soup and the entree.  Overall, the restaurant offered great service, nice ambiance, elegant presentation, and even cool AC. The food, however, wasn't as great as I had hoped. Still, I thought this restaurant deserved 4 stars given how it excelled in so many ways.",

For our entrees we ordered fried rice and the Thai noodle stir fry. We LOVED both items. So much quality in a simple dish. Something you can't compare to a fast food Thai restaurant.

Ordered the Pad Thai, with no shrimp and extra cilantro, level 4 spice. Once there, the host very nicely asked if I'd like any extra sauce or toppings, at which point I asked for extra peanuts and limes. He took my card, rang me up and went to the back to grab those, but failed to tell me there was an extra charge for the peanuts. When I asked about it, he said \"yeah, it was just a dollar.\" I personally don't mind the extra charge, but I do mind not being informed. The chicken in the dish was tasteless, and it seemed like they overcompensated with spice instead of flavor. In my opinion, this was a waste of $14 and I could've gotten better   from Nothing But Noodles across the street.",

The restaurant is huge and has bar seating in front of the kitchen as well as a huge dining room with tables.  We sat at a table but I think next time,  we will definitely try the bar area.   The staff were all super nice and the restaurant is very nice and modern as well. There are plenty of choices on the menu. We ordered the papaya salad,  medium spicy,  the fresh Basil roll,  the chicken satay and the Thai chicken wings.   The papaya salad was by far our favorite item.  We loved every bit of it.  We thought it was authentic and had all the right ingredients and was just as spicy as we expected based on our order.   The fresh Basil roll was also yummy.  Really loved the sauce that came with it.  The chicken satay was good,  the chicken tasted fresh and well-cooked. It had a little char but was still juicy.  Would have preferred both sauces on the side. Actually would have loved a little more crunchy sauce like the one that came with the Basil roll.   The chicken wings were meh. My husband thought they were OK but I wasn't a huge fan.   Would definitely come back again for papaya salad and to try other dishes.",

Got the drinks (pineapple mojitos, small, just OK, could have used more rum, bit weak). Our waitress forgot that we ordered an appetizer. She was nice, but not very attentive, later she forgot to bring us extra plates that we needed, so we just grabbed some from the near by table.  The chicken larb was decent, so were our entrees- the pad kee mow (got beef), tasty and pad see-ew. Decent sized entree, just kinda pricey.  Nice decor, same inside the restrooms, clean. Service, not to so good. Food and drinks - decent, but had better (and pricey).  Oh, skip the candies at the exit, they're way too spicy, the strangest flavor of candy I ever had.",

It was pretty empty despite being the weekend and prime dinner time. Still, it took 5-10 minutes for a server to introduce themselves (after we were immediately seated) and start us off with drinks, and it wasn't even our assigned server who took our orders. I had Pad Thai (rice noodles stir fried with chicken, shrimp, eggs, scallions, peanuts, and served with bean sprouts and slaw on the side). While the dish is tasty and the jumbo shrimp are nice and plump (all 3 of them), this dish was not worth $16.50. The shrimp needed more flavor. There was hardly any chicken (I would have loved more shrimp too). The Boyfriend had Red Curry, which includes bell pepper, bamboo shoots, and basil and is served with rice for $16.95. The curry was delicious and was mild-medium in spiciness, but the waitress did give the impression that it could be prepared to a higher degree of spiciness, if desired. It came with an oversized spoon that filled up the entire width of the bowl. The food and atmosphere here are great, but the prices are too high.",

I love my shoyu, so we got that as well.  I was a little disappointed that they did not serve sticky rice,  which is a staple in Hawaii. Does not cost more,  just a different way of cooking.

I asked for a side of mixed vegetables and got 5 individual containers of a different type of veggie in each - was that necessary?!  The vegetables were not fully cooked.  My Thai hot for pad see eww was pretty much mild.  And I didn't realize all of this until I drove 20 minutes back home.  Not to mention our order for 2 pad see ewws, 2 egg rolls, 1 white rice, and a side of veggies was over $60!!! There are a million other Thai spots better than this one in Charlotte and that are not a complete rip off....so don't waste your $$$.",

    "text": "Fantastic Thai restaurant in Ballantyne, Charlotte.  We stopped in after several friends suggested their Pad Thai.  Having moved here from Hawaii, getting good Pad Thai is a must.  And, Basil did not disappoint.   Fantastic and their jasmine rice was very well done.   We also order the Larb and it was fantastic.  Instead of Romaine, they served the minced beef with Cabbage.  That worked!  The cilantro and mint added to the beef was perfect.    We also had the red curry.  It was just barely spicy and was well balanced.  We had it with Chicken and it's the closest thing to our favorite place in Hawaii we have tasted since moving here. And, they use white chicken. Well done.    Love this place and Renee, our server was amazing. She knew the dishes well and told us all the Gluten free options.  Love that.   Kudos and look forward to coming back soon.",

With two little kids, there is nothing on the menu for them so this is NOT a good family place. We asked for a side of vegetables and were told we had to order an actual vegetable meal! Are you kidding me? My kids ate nothing but rice. We tried another time and my husband and I were again disappointed with how much we spent and how underwhelming the food was. Won't be back.",

I am from the west coast and have eaten really good pad Thai but until this restaurant I have not had yummy results locally. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 stars is because the portion size is small. It had great protein in it but overall was a very small dish. If they add some more noodles that would help portion size. Meat wise it was a nice portion.",

    "text": "The food was good. That is what my wife and I told the man who asked us how our time at the restaurant was when we left.   To be honest the food was okay and that is why I give this review three stars but the service was terrible.  The service was rushed and rude.  The waitress seemed to think that reciting a draft beer list at warp speed was cute or helpful (Saints preserve us if she thought it she was being helpful).  Ordering was a very rushed and stressful experience that I would ordinarily associate with being at the Varsity in Atlanta GA.  I kept thinking we came here for a nice leisurely meal with our precious alone time and whoops there goes the waitress sprinting from the table before I could add an appetizer to the order.  (Seriously she did not even try to up-sale us from water when we sat down originally, let alone ask us if we wanted an appetizer)   It doesn't get any better from that point.  She forgets the beer order.  Splashes it over the table when she brings it over.  We decide at that point that we rather leave and inform another waiter of our intention but he asks us to stay and will talk to the waitress.  We had hoped that meant that we had seen the last of her at our table but no she comes back over to almost spill a drink on us. (Only soaked the the plate which was gratefully finished at that point).  (She never spilled drinks before she tells us).  Anyways I enjoy eating at places where our patronage is welcomed and wanted.  Obviously this is not that place and we do not intend to go back.",

We watched 2 tables who were seated and ordered after us get their apps, and main course well before us.  We stopped a food runner to check on our order, which was brought out right after we asked about it.  After the food was brought, the waitress never checked on us.  We finished eating and had to flag her down to request the check.  They were not that busy.  The food was 50/50.  My wife's shrimp salad was again perfectly cooked.  My steak salad however was over cooked and had no flavor.  So so sad.",

    "text": "When I arrived in Fort Mill, this place was so hyped I literally thought it was God's gift of thai cuisine. Everyone I talked to raved about the food, the service, and the decor among other things. Having had some pretty legit thai food myself, I braced myself. Coming into the restaurant looks very impressive. A very modern decor with an incredible bamboo-wood-thing ceiling. The lighting is perfect and it's not too loud even when crowded. However, that didn't deter my disappointment in all other aspects of the restaurant.  - Service The service is on and off. They are great when taking your order, getting your drinks/food in a reasonable time, and answering questions, but fairly slow when you need something like another drink, ordering additional items, or basically getting their attention when they aren't intending to come. The owner is very nice though.  - Food Here's where the bulk of my smh experience comes in. I ordered the Pad Thai the first time I went and then the Pad See-eu the second time. Both were extremely dry, lacked flavor, and generally just tasted like it came out of the microwave. We had some shrimp and chicken appetizers, both not impressive, as well as some curries around the table which were decent but nothing spectacular. One cool thing is that they have a spice tray which is a nice presentation, but they are just basic spices that don't really add anything distinct (which is something you would expect from a place like this).  Overall.. The only reason I came back a 2nd time is because someone insisted we go, but otherwise I will never come back again.",

Others in Ballantyne have had similar experience .   They choose to return because of the food and the fact that it is the best Thai experience in the area .  Others with less patience and higher service standards may choose to dine elsewhere.    Tonight we waited more than 10 minutes at a table with no acknowledgement from wait staff that repeatedly walked by us without so much as making eye contact .  We returned the favor by walking out and enjoying a fine dinner elsewhere .  I advised the manager of our decision . He eventually apologized and I hope he takes the opportunity to educate his wait staff or take this act where it may be better appreciated.",

We ordered pad thai, tom yum soup, sweet and sour tofu, basil rolls, egg rolls and lettuce chicken wraps. The chicken in the lettuce wraps had actually gone bad - the smell was noticeably off and we had to send it back. Basil rolls were good but small for the price - just two pieces with hardly any shrimp. Same with the egg roll - we couldn't even taste egg. The sweet and sour tofu was the nights major miss - it had absolutely zero flavor. The sweet and sour sauce added nothing to the dish and we had to heap on our own spices from the spice tray. Pad thai also had almost no flavor as well.   Service was brusque and spotty. The prices do not match the food and service and ambiance was considerably less warm than the uptown location. Will get my thai fix at thai first instead.",

Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth.   And the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it.   On our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something.   I really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back.   Oh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast.",

    "text": "We were excited to see a new Thai restaurant come to the neighborhood especially since we were not a fan of JoJo. Well maybe it's the location but the food was plain vanilla yet the prices were gold plated!  We ordered takeout which included some basics to see if we should go further next time. Eggs rolls, pad Thai and steamed veggies dishes. Portions were small. Flavoring was minimal. Lack of much chicken or shrimp or peanuts in Pad Thai.    The bill though was way over the top. At least 2x what it should have been. It will be interesting to see if this place lasts long.",

    "text": "My experience at Basil has been excellent in the past.  Unfortunately the last several \"food\" experiences have been disappointing.  I placed a take out order for 4 meals yesterday and was told the meals would be ready in 30 minutes.  I arrived 40 minutes later only to find the hostess giggling with the words, \"I have forgotten to place an order again!\"  She called the manager, Joel who arrived at the hostess stand without a single apology and said the meals would be ready in 30 minutes.  Accidents happen however good customer service is essential in turning a bad situation around and retaining customers.  The food was once again disappointing and several of the orders were incorrect (mild instead of hot) Vegetables added with a \"No Veggie\" order.  I must say my experience at the Uptown Basil is ALWAYS excellent.  I will not be dining at Basil Stonecrest again!  I am a foodie and review restaurants for television and print as a \"Lifestyle Expert.\"  Too many off nights and bad customer experiences will not result in return customers which is vital in the restaurant industry.",

    "text": "Just posted on Google and Facebook about my terrible experience-want to share here.  My family  of 3 went here tonight, spent over $100 , including tip, for mediocre service, small portions.  BEST PART-when they boxed food, it was incorrect and by the time I noticed it-right after we left, I asked them to make it right-not just re-box as all the sauce had spilled out.  Hostess explained that management took no responsibility for food once it left restaurant.  When I explained I would just write a review, her professional, managerial answer was , \"well I was going to help you, but with your attitude ...\". No wonder the place had lots of empty tables in busy Stonecrest on a Friday at 7:00.  Obviously restaurant not doing well and every little bit of food given away could bankrupt them.  Obviously will be visiting their competition one mile down the road in Blakeney.",

    "text": "I found myself at Basil after a haircut and decided to get some takeout and wait for it at the bar. The restaurant is really beautiful and has a classy atmosphere.   Our go-to thai dishes are larb, Pad Thai, and panang chicken. Panang curry was not on their menu so I ordered larb, Pad Thai and a shrimp and vegetable dish. I noticed it was pretty expensive, so was expecting it to be really good. I drank two drafts while I waited and the staff was really nice. The manager stopped by and spoke to me, he was very personable. The bill came to $64.   When I got home, my husband and I opened it up and found a very skimpy portion of larb. It was tasty, just not very much. The pad thai was fine, not great. Clumps of noodles not mixed in, chicken was dry. The shrimp dish was a container of steamed broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage with 5 grilled butterfly shrimp. The sauce was on the side. No rice. Overcooked shrimp, undercooked broccoli, wet cabbage, sauce was ok. This was a $25 dish and I was not impressed. We usually have at least enough leftovers for one person to have lunch the next day, but that was not the case this time because there just wasn't that much food.  Since I can get delicious succulent Thai food from other places for half the price, I won't be returning to Basil.",

The red curry with chicken was supposed to have extra bamboo shoots and no bell peppers, instead it just had no bell peppers.  Everything was very skimpy, but flavorful.  We enjoyed the taste until I noticed that my chop sticks had mold growing down the entire length of them.  Yikes!  We called the restaurant to tell them, and the hostess who answered was quite nice and yet seemingly ineffectual as she did not ask for us to bring the moldy chopsticks back or if we wanted a refund.  I say stick with Thai House on Hwy 51--always delicious, fresh and plenty of food in the dish!!!  I will try to post a picture of the chopsticks when I figure out how to do that...",
