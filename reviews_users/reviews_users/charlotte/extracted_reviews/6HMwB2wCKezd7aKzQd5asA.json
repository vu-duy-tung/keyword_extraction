We came in 10 minutes before closing because we were starving and had sushi cravings and the servers were so nice. They didn't give us any attitude or any dirty looks and didn't even rush us. Ninja roll is definitely my favorite. I will definitely be back and not when they're about to close",

If you order a basic roll i.e. spicy tuna or California roll you're safe, but their specialty rolls are a no go! Last time I visited with a friend we ordered two basic rolls and two specialty rolls. The ingredients in the specialty were unrecognizable!  The salmon was a blood red color and there was something in one of the rolls that looked like liver...still not sure what it was suppose to be! We actually sent our food back and went to Chick-fil-a.   If you must eat here keep your order simple.",

I order tempura onion only and it's amazing; like a bunch of onion rings inside the rice roll.   Their VEGETABLE FRIED RICE is also nice. Lots of veggies included.   SPICY TUNA ROLL contained a mashed paste of tuna instead of a nice chopped fish. Bit of a turnoff. The rice was nicely done this time. I've had sushi rolls here before where the rice is too mushy as well. This time the rice was right.   EEL NIGIRI was good; as expected.",

    "text": "Not one of the better sushi places I've been to (but then again, we're comparing North Carolina sushi to California sushi).  The place was pretty much dead when me and 3 other coworkers came in at lunch time.  I was in Charlotte on business and this was the closest sushi restaurant to our office.  We started off with edamame which was a really generous portion.  I noticed the menu had pho which was interesting because I'd never been to a sushi spot that also served pho. They had many rolls on their lunch menu but unfortunately no pictures.  I ended up with the Rising Sun Roll which is tuna, crab & shrimp rolled with tobiko, topped with Japanese mayo.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be very bland with barely any japanese mayo on top.   Service was on point though.  And the restaurant setting is nice.  It's right at the boardwalk of a man-made lake.  Unfortunately the food was not very satisfying and I probably won't be back next time I'm in Charlotte for work.",

I got the professor roll and it was excellent, fresh, and pretty! I really liked how they offer half rolls, thats something I hadn't seen before. I know sometimes I can't finish 2 rolls but I want variety so thats a cool option. I hope they have some weekly specials because I would love to come back and bring my Fiance!",

    "text": "Visiting from NYC :) So I came here for a mini weekend vacation with my boyfriend and friends. We were exploring around the area and came to this restaurant for lunch. I'm a sushi lover and I have tried many different types of rolls from different states/countries and in my opinion, the sushi here is decent. Not the best but it's still good. The thing I like most about this place is that they have a variety of options in their menu to accommodate just about everyone. Typically sushi restaurants either offer just sushi and tempuras or just sushi, tempuras and hibachi dishes but this one really impressed me because it included sushi, tempura, hibachi and Vietnamese food. Our waitress was really nice but our food took a while to get to our table. The prices are fair (around $10 - $13 per roll depending on the type of roll you get) but keep in mind that if you have a party of 6 or more people, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to your bill whether or not you decide to split the check.",

Before we could even sit she was already rushing us for our drinks, but took about 10 minutes to bring it out. For appetizers we order crab ragoons and fried pork dumplings. The crab ragoons weren't all that but the pork dumplings we're pretty good. We ordered pho but didn't get any of the condiments, which we had to ask for. Disappointed because usually pho comes out steaming hot but this pho didn't. We didn't see any steam and the bowl was just warm to the touch. We had ordered rare on the side because we only like our meat slightly cooked and didn't receive it until 5-10 minutes after we received our pho. By that time our pho was already cold and the meat didn't even cook in our pho. We ran out of our drink and sat there for about 10-15 minutes for a refill while the waitress was walking back and forth. Wouldn't recommend this place.",

Waitress forgot about us several times. Asked for things. Never got them. Didn't even acknowledge that she had not brought things to the table. Owner seemed to be present, but only worried about tending to the drawer.  While we were there another couple who had been waiting got up and left. We should have done the same.

After a considerable wait (there were only six other people there at that hour), she came back to take our order. I asked where our drinks were and she apologized. People want at least water while they are looking at the menu. Anyway, she brings me regular tea when I ordered GREEN tea -- hello, it's a Japanese restaurant.   I could see our order up at the sushi counter   and she didn't even go up to check on it.  The sushi chef kept ringing the bell for her. I almost wanted to go up and get it myself.  She brings  the first part of our order and then she brings my companion's  - -he ordered mackerel and she brought him tuna!  It's as if she never worked in an Asian restaurant before!   Last, but not least, she brings us our check  and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. We did but at that point, we gave up, paid the bill, and left.  WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Not going back.",

I like their location and nice view of the boardwalk and lake, and their food is good, although for some reason not as good as the other Sushi 101 locations. The inside is nice, but could be cleaner. It looks like they never clean under the tables at the couches.  I also have noticed they don't have the greatest sanitation rating, which is a little frightening for a sushi restaurant.  The main problem, though, is the service. It's just always bad.  It doesn't matter if it's crowded, not crowded, lunch, dinner, weekend, weekday. I've tried all different times and it's just consistently bad--even when the owner is there. He seems to just wander around doing nothing and not noticing that people aren't being attended to by the servers.  Refills are hard to come by and the delivery of the food is strange.  After waiting for awhile, someone at the table may receive an entree when nobody else has even been served their soup or salad.  I want to like them, but they make it very hard.",

And at the very end, when I had to call her over for a check.  I wouldn't have had a problem if the restaurant was busy and she was swarmed with tables, but the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  If you would have sat with us, it would have been pretty clear that she was treating us differently from her other tables.  Servers play an important role as the \"face\" and brand of every restaurant.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I was seriously disappointed with my meal at Love Sushi.  I ordered the beef and shrimp teriyaki plate which was $16 (rounding off). At first I was surprised when she didn't ask how I'd like the meet cooked but I just thought they cook one way however when it came out is was pink in the middle. I mean it was not slightly pink but just way to pink and no flavor. It made me gag. The broccoli was hard as a rock. The fried ice had nothing but a little bit of egg and rice, that's all. I also order shrimp tempura rolls and I found it strange that it had nothing but fried shrimp. When I asked the waitress she said yea they make theirs plain. Hmm, I wouldn't name it shrimp tempura if it isn't your normal one. My mother ordered spider roll and it made us sick to our stomach. Honestly for the price you are paying the food is just to plain and no flavor. I won't be eating here again, I'm sorry. The waitress was attentive at least.",

Disappointed in everything, except my 2 year old's meal. My husband and I were fighting over who got to finish his food. For sushi, it's very cheap - however our bill was $39 and I am mad we didn't go to mcdonalds and get the $1 menu, since it was $39 of pure crap.  I'd rather have gone to Taco Bell and crapped my pants for the next 3 days.  The fish didn't have that nice fresh taste, and tasted reaally fishy (I know it's fish ). The rice was sour which ruined all of the rolls and my salmon nigiri.  Avoid. Or go next door to the Vietnamese place... we realized as we left the sushi place that everyone was next door....",

We waited a good ten minutes before someone came to get our drink order, and then maybe 15 minutes before flagging another server down to place our order. And they've decided to roll out a new ordering system and haven't gotten the kinks out yet. A holiday is a bad time to change your POS system.   Service was disjointed and very slow. I am not sure they actually had a floor plan for who served what tables. Hopefully today was an anomaly!",

    "text": "Just tried this place out for the first time in need of a Pho fix. At first I was a bit apprehensive to try the Pho here, especially with it being a Japanese restaurant, but to my surprise, the Pho was DELICIOUS! I'm very picky about my Pho, most especially that I come from California and I KNOW what delicious and authentic Pho tastes like...and this place just about came pretty close to a familiar place I like to go to back home in CA.   I ordered the beef brisket, beef shank, and tendon (i think) soup, and it was really good! One thing my friend and I noticed though was that the chili sauce wasn't very spicy, and if you like your soup spicy, you really had to pack in that spice, also the broth was a bit too beefy and strong  and kinda too salty for my liking of a beef soup, but it was still tasty. That could've probably been one of the reasons why the spice from chili sauce and Siracha wouldn't come through? (idk, who really knows). We also ordered the summer rolls (in other places theyre called spring rolls, which are the fresh rolls with shrimp) and those were good as well, and their peanut sauce was SO good, and we also ordered the tempura tofu, which were good as well, which was served with the side of tempura sauce which i didn't care for much and with sweet chili sauce which tasted a lot better with this dish.   Overall, the service at this place was great, everyone was really friendly and efficient.  The restaurant itself was fairly good priced and also very clean!   Next time I come here I definitely want to try the sushi here too...But for now, I'm happy with the Pho! ....Too bad it's an hour and half away from where I live, but I guess I wouldn't mind the drive when I'm already in the area.",

The taste was great, everything seemed fresh. I did not mention the wait, there was no need or excuse. There were only 6 customers in the restaurant.

So I didn't eat there till now though it's been years since my wife and I started going to Boardwalk Billy's and Lengs which are just across a small bridge.  The lady serving us was nice and polite. He mudslide I ordered and the spring roll app was okay too. But the problem was the Crispy tuna roll. The roll had a good size chunk of tuna but it didn't taste good to me. I know sushi. I'm sure it could have been the guy who was on shift.  And then the interior. It was not exaxtly what we are used to. It looks more like a Pho place. Price was reasonable. The tuna role was under $10, and the mudslide was $5 and some cents. So it wasn't bad.  That's my review. Hope it helps!",

We googled to see what time the establishment closed and saw it was 10:30- seeing how they're usually quick and you're in and out we came in. We were greeted by a guy who was playing on his phone who said \" wow everyone wants to eat late tonight- you better choose your meals quickly!\" He stood there for a minute hoping we'd leave- which I suggested, then seated us. We noticed another couple had just got there and just ordered. It was 5 minutes before someone took our DRINK order (even though they were in SUCH a rush) I ordered a martini and our waitress says to the bartender \"they've ordered a drink\" to which the bartender loudly groaned \" UGHHH\" and slammed a bottle down. She said I'm sorry to the bartender. Our food arrived and we finished at 10:35. Five minutes passed closing. As a business owner having customers means I am in business, and that people in a way- need what I have to offer. When we are the reason you have a job, don't complain. There were 4 dirty tables upon entering the building yet everyone stood around on their phones, complaining about having to DO THEIR JOB.   We went to pay and the same rude guy who greeted us sat there on his phone when we tried to pay him.   Go Literally ANYWHERE ELSE and you will have better food and service.",

Quality has come down from what bit Sushi 101 had back in the day.  There's definitely a lot of selection, though some parts of the menu can be confusing. The raw fish isn't top quality stuff and I've had better for similar prices. I didn't find their menu to be particularly cheap either, unlike some other reviews. As I said though, lots of selection. They seem to know their stuff when it comes to real Japanese food. It's not all just hibachi chicken and rice. There's gyouza, edamame, lots of sake options, *real* sushi and sashimi (as close as you can get here), chicken katsu style and the various noodles.  Our server was super polite and friendly, smiling the entire time. However, it seemed like he was the only person running the tables and he was a bit flustered with 4-5 tables seated. The sushi chef was also friendly, though we didn't sit at the bar. In the end though, it's not a place I would specifically single out for a return visit.",

Two other couples came in sat down after us and the managers wife, waited on one of those couples!  I couldn't believe it. So, we got up and left and no one even thought to ask why.   Needless to say, and long story short their food isn't worth the price or the terrible service. At all.

Every time I eat here the servers are neither attentive or friendly... 4 stars if they fixed that.",

Everything looked delicious, except one of my sushi rolls had a long, thick piece of black hair in it. Luckily, I noticed before eating anything, so I called the waitress over & she immediately went to fix the problem. Strange though how there was no apology for the crazy accident, because it would've been repulsively disgusting if I were to eat it. No manager came by, nor any adjustments to my bill were made. I put two stars because I know it's an accident, but at the same time something more should've been done, a simple apology or something. So due to that I felt no need to tip 20% due to the service not exceeding my needs. My boyfriends food was good he ordered the shrimp fried rice -amazing taste. But my experience left me uneasy especially being that I came in with high hopes just to leave unsatisfied.",

The second server (make) wasn't very informative and didn't have many suggestions. He neglected to clear off our dirty dishes nor did he do check backs. Our food took forever to come out and the restaurant was dead. The quality of the food was blah.... presentation was terrible. People must come here simply for the view and it's location. If you're a sushi lover... oh and my 2nd Saketini tasted like dirty dish water. I do NOT recommend this spot!!",

I ordered a noodle bowl with stir fried udon noodles & katsu style tofu (which the waitress recommended both). The tofu was horrible! I'm used to small crunchy cubes on tofu in my dishes and this was huge hunks of \"wet\", mushy tofu and a semi mushy/fried coating! Gross!!!!! The noodles didn't have any flavor. I mentioned it to the waitress, but she did nothing about it and also forgot my hot sauce, so I couldn't even dress it up.  The curry shrimp appetizer was the only good item.   I was extra hungry when I left & disappointed to pay nearly $30 (with drinks). I don't recommend getting any other the other dishes besides sushi. My friend's steak was not good either, although her lobster was decent.  I don't even feel like I'd be back to try the sushi at this point. Perhaps if they would've been a bit more accommodating or caring about my nasty water logged/half fried tofu cut into giant pieces bigger than a dish sponge.  No thanks.",

Host was very awkward and seemed swamped even though there were only maybe 7 guests in the restaurant total and 5 other employees.  I paid and then he took the next person in line which was weird cause he didn't even let me know if my order was ready or not.  Ten more minutes pass and nothing.  I then ask when will my order be ready and I'm ignored.  I ask again and the cooks look at the waiter confused.  Meanwhile people are coming in trying to dine in and no one is seating them or acknowledging them.  Finally, at 8:13, 50 minutes after i places my order, I request a refund.  The host proceeds to process it and I ask if he needs my card.  He ignores me.  I ask again and he then says no.  I didn't even get to try the sushi but this is absolutely ridiculous, he was not polite and the wait time was unrealistic",

I spent more time than I would like swatting bugs. Likely a result of. Wong close to the lake. However, it a great space to dine and people watch along the boardwalk.   This was a first visit. I will give Love Sushi another try and update my review.",

It wasn't bad but it was WAY over priced. I feel there are other place that offer better quality and larger quantities for a lower price. Just my thoughts. Might be worth a try if you are looking for a new place.",

They have too much on the menu ranging from sushi, pho, spring rolls, to fried rice. Settled on a rainbow roll, 2 pieces of salmon sashimi, and calamari. As well as 2 glasses of sauvignon blanc.  The calamari came out first, and it had a nice seasoning and spicy mayo. The rainbow roll was decent, but the salmon sashimi was a bit stringy.   Service was okay, our waitress wasn't super attentive although it was pretty empty. Would come back if I really need a sushi fix.",

Its certainly a must try; however, I'd opt for grilled shrimp instead of chicken. We also tried the fried sweet potatoes, which were pretty good as well.  I love their batter; it's lite. I've tried several Tempuras; however, none are as lite as this - which I love! I felt satisfied instead of fat after eating the Calamari, Shrimp Tempura, and Chicken  .  Most of the previous reviews state their service was bad. Luckily, our service was pretty nice! Perhaps because it was a slow night. Either way, dinner was yummy and filling. Our server was pleasant and our bill was reasonably priced (approx. $35 total for everything we ordered).  We also scored a nice patio seat beside the pond. Score for our date night!",

The fish is decent quality, but the specialty sushi rolls all had this sort of bland, similar taste.

All of our entrees were very good as well.    The service, although friendly, was unprofessional, disorganized, and very very slow.  Having been a server and bartender, I saw that they were understaffed, but there were only 5 tables in the entire restaurant.  Food came out helter-skelter, our drinks were empty quite a bit of the time, we were forced to ask several times for silverware, and we could hear several arguments between staff members.  To top it all off, we were charged an automatic gratuity on a party of 6.    I'll probably go back there because of it's location and the food, but I'll definitely be expecting poor service.",

I don't mean wet, I mean wet like she didn't wring the cloth out.  Fish eggs were scattered on the table and my seat.  One of the seat had a puddle of water in it.  I then attempted to fetch a rag to do what she thought she did and another staff member asked if he could help me so I told him about our disappointment.  Well, he told the same person and she kinda fixed it...of course she left fish eggs on the table.....of course.  The waitress did not know the menu...of course!  Of course she didn't!  The food was mmmm ok.  The wasabi looked beat up and while we were eating the kitchen staff began bringing out the days trash THROUGH the dining area!  I asked my friends if they had a back door at their homes, and they advised that they did.  Of course!  Of course they have a back door....so Sushi 101 why not use yours.

I'm not as adventurous as I once was when it comes to raw fish, so I generally stick to the rolls, and I haven't had a bad one yet.  With that said, this is not the same caliber of sushi you will find out of the city, say in HI, but it's fresh- It's just that something is missing...  There's typically a sparse crowd, so I'm surprised it's stayed open as long as it has.

The bananas were fine, but both ice creams, the green tea in particular, just weren't that good.

Finally a waitress asks me what I want to drink, she brings it to me and walks right away. So after waiting 20 minutes for a drink nobody asks what I want to eat? So I go to the manager and ask him if anyone is going to ask me what I would like to eat, he tells the same exact waitress and she comes over to me at the second and takes my order, rudely might I add. When I get my food she asks if I need anything, I didnt even have napkins at my table so she goes and gets the napkins and throws them at me. At that point I politely walked out.

It isn't where I go when I want super high quality sushi but it can feed my addition just A-OK.  The outside patio is just gorgeous.  It is a great spot to watch people walk around the boardwalk or watch paddle boaters on in the...pond..river?  Not sure, but it's water !  The service isn't outstanding.  Especially on nights where they have the great specials, the wait for drinks can get long.  That being said though, if you go in with plenty of time, and want a place that's easy on the wallet with a great view - give it a try!",

My food took forever even though there were only 2 tables other than mine. I wanted to order another till but she never asked and just randomly brought my check. They brought me one water the whole time I was there. My throat was super dry as I was eating and my server was nowhere to be found. In the bathroom they had ran out of soap and paper towels.

We enjoyed the setting at the boardwalk and went for a stroll after eating our rolls. No issues.. This place was A-OK.",

    "text": "I love this place.  It's in the University Area on the boardwalk so it's a great place to come, walk and shop, then stop in for a bite to eat.  I have two favorite spots to sit when I come here.  One is outside on the patio overlooking the water, but only when it's nice outside.  The second is on the big comfortable black leather couches.  Each couch can hold three people easily with more than enough elbow room to spare.  I brought the \"BF\" here.  Well it was kinda a set up.  I really wanted some Sweet Potatoe Yakitori and this shopping center has a Michael's Craft so I told him that I needed some glue dots for class and this way we can be conviently here to stop in and grab a bite...so glad this worked :)  He ordered the Beef Ribs which we could hear sizziling from behind the counter.  It came witha side of white rice and a sald.  I ended up eating the salad b/c it had a ginger based dressing on top and he really couldn't get into it...but to me it was delicious!  I should start out by saying that we also ordered an appitizer; can't remember the name but it was sweet peppers, stuffed with cream cheese and crab meat, and then deep fried; served with a sweet and sour sauce.  OMG!  These were so good, will definitley have to try these again.  I ordered my Sweet Potatoe Yakitori, which is sliced sweet potatoes and flashed fried in tempura batter; served with a brown sauce.  If you've never had these...try it.  Their good but also a great way not to over eat since sweet potatoe  is full of fiber and will fill you up quickly and at $3.00 you really can't beat it.  I also ordered a fried California Roll and a Southpark Maki which is shrimp, crab snow pea salad, and cucumber.  We were stuffed and I was pretty surprised that the BF took a liking to the Sweet Potatoe Yakitori and even tried on of my Fried California Rolls :)  I've been here multiple times and the food to me is always consistently on point!",

They all seemed to taste the same event though they each had very different ingredients.   The deep fried bagel roll had to much tempura and didn't taste very good.   The fish seemed old and flavorless and didn't add anything to the sushi.   The service was really nice and it wasn't very busy when I went so that is why I give it a couple of stars.

Sushi 101 is right on the boardwalk and has an outdoor patio overlooking the lake (and during the summer has a nice view of the open air concerts on Thursday nights). Inside is comfortable and has a nice lounge environment. Second, they offer moderately priced fare that delivers exactly what I would expect, decent, though not great ,Sushi rolls. I have to admit that as this was my first visit I played it safe will Dragon and California Rolls so I couldn't give advice beyond that.  I agree with the other reviewers that the service isn't great... but if your like me and just want a quick sushi fix... this is a good spot.",
