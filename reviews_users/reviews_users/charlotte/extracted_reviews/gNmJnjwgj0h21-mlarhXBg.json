Unfortunately I haven't explored the rest of the menu so can't say much else about it but the shawarma was great. The Herban Legend certainly lives up to their name by incorporating some great tasting fresh herbs and spices. The flavor of the shawarma was much more complex than any other shawarma I'm used to so although I was surprised, it was a pleasant surprise. Although good I'm not necessarily dying to try it again, I think on my next go (and there will be a next go) I'll be exploring some of the other items on the menu.",

It's a two person operation, the chef and his sister, but thankfully there was no line and quick service.  We shared fries, which were, well.... fries.  Nothing particularly special there.  But then the sandwiches, the delicious, taste-bud pleasuring sandwiches!  I had the chicken shawarma, and it was so beautifully seasoned, with all the meet and veggies and sauce evenly spread throughout the flatbread (think, lightly toasted, thicker than a wrap, thinner than a pita).  It was simply spectacular.  Unfortunately, my wife had the black bean burger.  I say unfortunately because she is now convinced that she wants to be a vegetarian.  It was evidently that damn good.  What else?  prices are great, particularly for the quality of the food.  The folks were super pleasant, since we were the only customers we spent a bunch of time talking with them about good eats in Charlotte.  The ambience, obviously, depends on the location.  We were at a bar which was nice as we could have a tipple to quench our watering-mouths.  Highly, highly recommended!",

Good ratio of meat to bread to sauce, although sometimes they have a tendency to over sauce just a little which makes shoving it in the face a little more of a messy proposition.  The truffle fries, which are always on the menu are good, but I don't love them, so I don't usually get them unless I can split them with someone.  Anyway, it's a great food truck run by awesome peeps, so I hope they keep hanging around.  And they also bump the best tunes during the rallies, so they deserve the support for that reason alone!",

At first the menu was semi-tame, but each week it seems to add complexity or unique food.  The food is excellent and flavorful, but rotates every single week.  There are a couple of items that stay on the menu like the black bean burger and french fries, but most things are that week only or on the menu every few weeks.  Today my choice was the Mojo Pork and Chorizo tostado with salsa and guacamole.  Big flavors.  Don't skip the french fries here either, because they are made to order and come out hot with seasoning.  If this truck stops at your work or your bar, go out and see what the menu is and pick something.  You shouldn't be disappoointed.",

    "text": "As far as uptown food trucks go, I have been leery. The reason food trucks took off is that they could offer relatively good food for really cheap due to the lack of needing to pay for rent. Then higher quality food made its way in and things got a little pricier, but should still be cheaper than a fixed location.  So, how does paying $9-10 for food truck offerings in uptown Charlotte make sense when compared to other take out lunch places?! It really doesn't at most food trucks in Charlotte.  Herban Legend is the food truck I have tried that breaks the rule. The menu is simple, the prices are reasonable, and the flavors are good. I've gone there several times and tried a few things, the Shwarma isn't \"authentic\", but the mix of flavors isn't something you will find elsewhere in Charlotte. Their burgers / sandwiches are done with care and tasty. Paired with the seasoned fries, which are really good, you can get out for $9.",

I work at Gateway Village, which, if you work there, you know that your lunch choices pretty much suck ass. There's only so much Subway you can endure, the Chik-Fil-A is a to-go spot (essentially 1/4 the entire menu, and pretty crappy), and the Cedar Street Tavern's food is criminally awful. On Thursdays, however, gastronomic salvation comes in the form of a sky blue truck with some daring takes on the traditional sandwich/burger fare.  Loved that Chef Brian made mention of the Shwarma, \"as seen in 'The Avengers'.\" Because I was craving their shwarma, so deliciously marinated in all kinds of Arabic spices. But the pork and chorizo tostada, something new on the menu, sounded intriguing.  HOLY MOLY...ESPECTACULAR! The pork and chorizo was soaked in mojo, and spiced just right, the tostada crispy just like they should be. Unbeeeeeeeleeevable!  If you're willing to stray from the boring and give your taste buds a gastronomical workout, give the Herban Legend a try.   I just learned the HL truck will be at Toringdon on Fridays. I live 10 minutes from Toringdon, and I work from home Fridays. Guess where I'm having lunch?",

The pretzel seemed a little hard and rubbery for some reason. Perhaps it was the cheese that had melted to the pretzel? It may be because it was... microwaved? Not too sure. Other than that, the sandwich and fries were fine. I would definitely order from the food truck again but I probably would not order the same sandwich again.

Antelope Venison skewers and some pita things with a cream cheese like substance, olive oil, and more venison.  The skewers were massive.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  The pairing with pitas underneath were perfect.  Unfortunately is what the most expensive thing on their menu, but for $12 it was priced just right for me.

The meat was a bit dry (had that heat lamp texture), but the yogurt sauce didn't really revitalize it - it soaked the pita and made for quite the mess. I feel fortunate we found a table and I wasn't trying to eat my dissolving sandwich standing up. The fries were good (who doesn't love truffle fries?), but the truffle oil and salt seemed to really soak in to the bottom layers - nature of the beast I guess?

However, if two stars really equates with \"Meh, I've experienced better,\" then two stars is what they've earned.  We've just been to The Herban Legend once, and I was pretty amped up about it, given the positive responses they've had. Unfortunately, I was quite let down. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and it was thoroughly dry. More mustard would have helped, but only a bit, since the meat and the bread were both like sawdust. We split an order of truffle fries as well: the first few were tasty, but the truffle oil quickly got overwhelming, and we didn't finish them.  Will I give The Herban Legend another try? Well, I don't know. I usually like to give restaurants a second shot unless the experience was truly horrific, and The Herban Legend wasn't quite that bad. However, the problem with a food truck is that you usually get your food and scoot, which means you can't send it back if it's bad. After spending nearly $20 on a couple lackluster sandwiches and a single order of disappointing fries, I don't know that I'm motivated to try them again.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to score some goods from Herban Legend for a while now and I'm so happy I ran in to (not literally) their food truck off of South Blvd near Icehouse!   I parked my car and, because of the chilly temps and blustery winds, was nearly knocked over on my way to order! I perused the menu for a few moments, chatted with the owner and decided on the Sicilian chicken panini. He kindly offered to bring my sandwich to my car upon its completion so I didn't have to wait out in the cold. How nice! I paid via Square Up and 5 minutes and $6 later, I was on my way home, sandwich in hand.  The panini did not disappoint! It was toasty, stuffed with chunks of chicken, tomatoes, scallions, creamy feta, spicy sauce (albeit a touch heavy), and a few other veggies mixed in. It was a super flavorful, hearty lunch. I'm looking forward to trying more!",

    "text": "My sister brought me to the Food Truck Friday event while I was in town.  The Herban Legend was the first truck I saw and the menu had me drooling so of course I stopped here.  They were having a mac and cheese special that night with bacon and black pepper (I think there was roasted garlic as well, but I'm having trouble remembering for some reason).  I realized when I went to pay that I didn't have cash, but thankfully they accepted credit cards through Square.    After a few minutes, my food was ready and I had a piping hot order of mac and cheese in front of me.  The bacon was super smokey and lent it's smokiness to the whole dish and the pepper added a nice bite.  Their sauce was nice and creamy and clung to the pasta.    It was an incredibly good meal and the price seemed fair for the amount of food I got.  I'll definitely be going back to Food Truck Friday to seek them out again.",

I even went back a few times in the same hour to get more food because it was so delicious and flavorful.   The shawarma is the die for and the best in Charlotte hands down. I'm a huge burger fan, and his has the most flavor of any burger I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself whenever you see the herban legend, you won't be disappointed.

    "text": "Herban Legend offers some great handheld choices for the hungry person who doesn't mind eating standing up.  We tried a number of things at the NoDa truck rally. I was excited to try the black bean burger with homemade salsa, black pepper and other goodies on top, but I was allergic to cilantro which was not only in the salsa but also inside the burger, so I only had one bite. However, that one bite was flavorific and I was bummed I didn't get to have the whole thing.    I had the Chicken Shawerma which also was incredibly flavorful - very spicy, but in a Moroccan way, not an \" I would pay a million dollars for a glass of milk\" way.  It actually filled me up more quickly than I would have guessed and I liked the flatbread it was on - not exactly a pita and was a little grilled.   I didn't get to try the truffled french fries because they had run out, so I assume they were great.    My only complaint? There's a nice lady who roams around collecting orders outside the truck and goes in/out of the truck for change. I actually think it's an inefficient way to do it compared with say Roots, which has a table/station where you clearly line up to place orders. A moving target creates chaos and hurt feelings about who's actually next in line. Plus it doesn't help expedite ordering going to/fro.    Also they also had samples or full sizes of gingerbread bread pudding. I tried the sample, and was glad I didn't get the full size. Not because it was bad, but because it was cold. Hmph.    Bottom line? They don't skimp on flavor so I will definitely eat from them again!",

It was filled with coffee seared steak & baja shrimp w/ guac, cheese, chimichurri, chipotle sauce and fries. The steak was tender and flavorful. All the fillings complimented each other really well. It was a flavor party in my mouth! There was a lot going on but it was excellent. I can't wait to try more from these guys.",

The fried green tomato grilled cheese with Havarti and roasted red pepper aoli is one of my favorites. The California burger was delicious but heavy and made me feel super full. Today I got a grilled Parisian baguette with ham, havarti, dijon arugula and tomato. The truffle fries are also delish!  The guys who run it are really friendly and they play good music while you wait. My only complaint is that it's a little pricey for being a la carte. I spend between 6-8 bucks for just the sandwich. It would be nice if they had a daily special or a combo. But I know they use gourmet ingredients, the food is really good and those guys have to cover expenses like gas so I make room in my budget for a weekly stop.",

I am a frequent customer of other Charlotte food trucks and I am used to getting pretty large portion sizes.  For example: The Tin Kitchen will serve you two good size tacos as well as a side (salad, chips & salsa, rice, etc.) for the same price as you will get at the Herban Legend.  It's convenient that they park outside of our building, however I may consider heading down the street a few min to get some Tin Kitchen the next time so I can get more for my money.",

    "text": "This truck has some outstanding flavors and I appreciate the healthier options available on this truck. However,  customer service and descriptions need some work.   This truck was at our workplace last week for lunch. There's a variety of options and various flavors to chose from. I ordered the black bean burger and a small order of couscous.  The burger was pretty awesome and messy. It had peppers, pepperjack cheese, salsa, chipotle aioli and arugula. This thing was loaded and huge.  Definitely a very filling burger. The only part it needed was a sturdier bun. With all the toppings, the standard bun just couldn't hold it all and pretty much became mush in my hand. The couscous was good. It was cold and had a roasted red pepper vinaigrette with feta. To me it tasted like it had a kick of curry added to it as well.   So customer service needs so.e work. The lady taking orders wasn't the most friendly. And the truck didn't let anyone modify the dishes at all! My first friend ordered the tilapia mufungo and is part Puerto Rican so she knows her way around some mufungo. She asked for the salsa on the side and they said they couldn't do that because they didn't have sauce cups. What? And couldn't they just push it to the side of the container? So she got it anyway, but it's not mufungo. It was basically fish over tostones. It was good, but not really mashed plantains. So my other coworker wanted the surf and turf burrito, but didn't want everything that came in it. The lady taking orders said they couldn't customize it and take toppings out. So she ended up with a BLT. The lack of customer service and the ability to customize brought this review down. So only get an item if you're sure you absolutely sure you love everything in the description.  Great concept and pretty good food. This truck could be better if they think of the customer.",

    "text": "I don't mean to be a grumpy reviewer here amongst obviously a sea of 5 star reviews. And I am going to be very honest up front that the person who took my order was EXTREMELY friendly and nice, she even gave me advice between he two items I was choosing to order.  How it works here is that they take your order in front of the truck, then the order is handed to one of the personnel inside the truck and they call your name when your item is ready.  I picked Herben Legend to be the first food truck to sample because it seemed like it had the shortest line amongst entree serving trucks. Therefore, I think my review is quite fair since I did not have any other trucks to compare the food to. I was gravitated towards this truck as well because of the eclectic ethnic choices on the menu board. American, Vietnamese, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Mexican!   I ordered the Mojo beef tostada and I was not impressed. I was not the only person who sampled the item, my cousin also had some of my food. Neither one of us liked it very much. After I lifted up my fried tortilla bowl like chip, there was an inch of red grease on the bottom of the paper plate...I also thought the presentation of the food could have been a bit well thought out, it was hard figuring out how to eat it. A pile of pulled beef with lemon zest and avocado piled on top of a big tortilla chip. The flavor was a bit too greasy and sour for my taste.   I will definitely give Herben Legend another try, it could be that I just ordered the wrong item or I caught them on a busy day. The fried green tomato provolone sandwich(the other item I was choosing to order) sounded extremely tempting!",

    "text": "Stopped for a bite to eat the food truck rally in South End last evening.  There were  four food trucks at the rally: Herban Legend, a cupcake truck, Goody Woody's (tacos, burritos), and Sticks and Cones (ice cream).  I was told Herban Legend is currently one of Charlotte's most popular food trucks, so I went with them.  This truck serves sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and hot dogs.  Most items are in the $6-8 range.  Sides run up to $5 each and non-alcoholic beverages are $1 each.  No combos.  Everything's ordered a la carte.  There's a bit of diversity on the menu -- you can get a French dip, like one of my buddies got, a Cuban sandwich, tostada, curry chicken wrap, and fish and chips.  I went with the shawarma, which is an Arab wrap, for $6.50.  This is one of the truck's top sellers.  I've had my fair share of shawarmas and thought Herban Legend's version was OK.  Theirs includes grilled chicken, Greek tzatziki sauce, tabouleh salad (cold minty salad made with bulgur and parsley), chopped tomatoes and french fries wrapped in flat bread.  The flat bread was grilled so it was hard and brittle.  This caused the wrap to break apart easily once I grabbed the sucker to bite into it.  It was packed with a sufficient amount of ingredients and plenty of sauce, so much so that the sauce was spilling all over the place as I ate.  Overall, it was satisfying, though I'd probably prefer softer bread and it'd be cool if they had some meat options like other shawarma joints offer.  I also ordered a side of Herban's truffle fries, which at $5, is pretty expensive for a side of fries.  They've also got regular fries for $2-3 and honestly, I tried both, and the truffle fries weren't worth the five bucks.  Both styles of fries were alright.  One order of fries is good for 2-3 people.  If I ever get the chance to revisit this truck, I'll probably order the fried green tomato grilled cheese sandwich.  Someone in our group last night ordered this and she loved it.  Beverage options were limited: Coke, Sprite, and bottled water.  The good thing about food trucks is you can BYOB.  Fast and friendly service.  Credit cards are accepted at a 25 cent surcharge.  You sign your receipt on their iPhone and can get the receipt texted or emailed to you.",

    "text": "\"Yay! I'm a fan.\" My first meal from Herban Legend was served during an event I coordinated for my job back in October. I had the chicken curry wrap, which was oh-so flavorful and delicious! Since then, Chef Seeley has been serving up regular lunches and dinners on Thursdays. He now has a new stop...bringing meals to the South Park crowd by setting up at Pfeiffer University off of Park Road in the back parking lot on Thursday nights. You can also find him at Innovation Park and near Johnson & Wales University.   His menu consists of regular burgers, black bean burgers (for the veggie lovers), and shawarmas (just to name a few) and then depending on the week he'll offer different specials. His fries are too tempting and generously seasoned. The prices are very reasonable (starting at $6) and already includes tax...you cannot get a better deal! While cash is preferred, he does accept credit cards.   When you see this giant blue truck, you'll definitely want to stop and get a meal. You'll receive friendly service as well!",

    "text": "I don't pass out 5-stars very often but the black bean veggie burger I had from this black was incredible.   Herban Legend parks off Morehead most Wednesdays and I was able to get there around noon with no line. I have yet to meet food truck operators that weren't friendly and enthusiastic and the folks in the herbal legend were no different.  For $6.50 I had perhaps the best veggie burger I've ever had: Patty of black beans, red bell peppers and onion. Topped with Pepper Jack cheese, salsa, arugula and chipotle aioli. Everything about it was fantastic the price, the size, the bun, the texture and flavor of the burger, the salsa, the aioli. It is very rare that I do not complain about some part of a veggie/black bean burger but something about this burger got me.  I haven't had a chance to sample more of the Herban Legend but something tells me I'll certainly be back!",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to grab some grub from Herban Legend this week! Seen these guys around town, at festivals and food truck rallies, but hadn't had the pleasure of checking them out. They were camped out next to NoDa Brewing one evening and it was just perfect. Beer and a food truck. Modern pb&j.   The prices are waaaaayyyy cheaper than I thought they were going to be. Ended up getting the tarragon chicken soup (I had a bit of a cold), a black bean burger and some seasoned fries. All for about $19.  The black bean burger was one of the most unique I've had in town. Where the burger itself had a less than desirable texture, the flavors were great. There had to be some sort of sriracha or chili cream sauce on it. The spice was great and all of the flavors worked very well together.   The tarragon chicken soup was awesome. Flavorful broth, but not overpowered by tarragon, with huge portions of chicken and rice. I was a happy camper with my soup opening a can of whoopass on my cold. Take that, winter! Also, much to my glorious surprise, it came with a half sammy. Just a simple grilled cheese, but it was so good.   The fries: just great. That is all. Didn't need ketchup.   Another perk is that you can pay with Square on an iPad. The fact that you add a tip and sign yourself is much more intuitive for a food truck. Glad to see so many people have adopted this method.   I'm looking forward to the next time I get to sample the fare from Herban Legend.",

    "text": "I have been dying to try this food truck for a while due to some of the other reviews.  This weekend as part of Food Truck Friday, I had my opportunity.    I had gotten to FTF late around 8:20pm so I knew my options may be limited.  I was the last person to place an order with Herban Legend so I feel lucky.    By this time, they had run out of almost everything on the menu except for a Chipotle burger.  They only sides they had when I ordered were chips which I passed on.  Later after I paid, they asked me if I was interested in their last order of fries and I pounced on that offer!   The burger was served on an onion bun.  The flavors were decent on the burger.  The fries were ok and flavored with parmesan cheese and possibly truffle oil?  The flavor was interesting but the fries were a little on the cold side.    Still a decent experience for my first one with this food truck.  I am looking forward to seeing them again and trying some of their other options.",

I had never had a cuban sandwich before, so I had nothing to compare it to. This was very tasty! It had the right amount of ingredients & the bread was pressed. SOOO good. The fries were cooked perfectly, they were crisp & hot.  They have some other offerings, which I would have loved to sample quite a few things. :D I will definitely be looking out for them in future food truck events.  The staff was very friendly & the wait time from ordering to getting food was minimal.  The prices are reasonable, too.",
