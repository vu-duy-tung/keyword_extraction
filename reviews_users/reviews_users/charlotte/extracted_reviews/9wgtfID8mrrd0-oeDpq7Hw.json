    "text": "What a cute lil place!! The famous Nathan hot dogs just make everything even better!! How in our many foot travels around Uptown the last month or two we never found this lil gem I'll never know. QCBC is \"tucked up\" in the French Quarter, once again a place found completely by accident while looking for a place to eat. Price is very reasonable for the quality, my husband had the Carolina dog, I a simple plain Nathan's dog with yummy beer cheese and grilled onions. We both enjoyed our dogs and will very likely go back. The chili was very good, and we will certainly have to go back for a bowl of chili. That said for hot dog chili my husband isn't a fan of chili w beans. That certainly won't stop us from going back!! Honestly what's better than an ice cold beer and a Nathan's hot dog on a late Saturday afternoon??? Our simple meal and drink took us both back to the early days of our marriage when we'd get a 25 cent draft, 15 cent hot dogs and play pool for another 25 cents!!! Too bad QCBC doesn't have pool tables! They do have a decent beer list you can choose from both local and non local breweries. I had a tangerine wheat and OMG was it one of the best beers I've ever had!! If you've not taken the time to check QCBC out yet you are missing good food, good ice cold beer and a cool lil place to enjoy them!! They have both indoor and out door seating.",

Flavors are fresh and tasty.  Far from your average restaurant chili, i.e. it doesn't come frozen in a bucket.    Do yourself and the owner operators a favor and get some!!!!!",

Great food, great service, great atmosphere and great prices.  I'll be back to Queen City beer & chili by the end of the month.",

By the way, get the one pound bowl. Just the right size!",

We each got two hot dogs; the Carolina Style Chili Dog and the Cincinnati Coney. Both were great, we also split a side of fries which were fresh out of the fryer. They were cooked perfectly. It's a good spot to grab a quick bite to eat or have a beer. The staff was super friendly. We'll definitely be back!",

The beer selection featured a nice amount of local craft brews and I was able to try a few I'd never had before. But the Star was the cheese coney. I went to school outside of Cincinnati and fell in love with Skyline, and the Cincinnati chili on the coney was on point. Our waitress said the previous owners were from Cincinnati and brought the recipe with them. Well they nailed it. I also did a brat that was good, but after the coney nothing was going to come close. We did the pimento cheese fries for an appetizer, and I loved the homemade pimento cheese. It's got a slightly different taste than normal pimento, but especially on the fries it just worked perfectly. My only complaint was the lack of air conditioning on a hot day, but once we settled in and had a few drinks it wasn't an issue.",

I had been waiting for this spot to open up for a while since I see it every time I'm in Brevard court grabbing lunch- glad to see it finally opened.  Went here for lunch so I could not partake in the beer, but I will definitely be back- either to grab a couple pints or fill a growler up to take home.  Love the concept.  The two chili dogs I had for lunch were spot on.  I went with the meal combo 3 which consists of two dogs, a side, and a drink.   They do not have many menu offerings but they make a strong showcase of their chili using various food vessels. My buddy got the nachos that were made of their house chips and a ton of toppings (added bacon for a dollar fidy).  Super reasonable prices for the food - seems like the more Charlotte grows the more expensive lunch uptown becomes.  The right side of the place is where you order the food, you can either take it out or bring it into the bar area where they have about 6 tables- or sit at the bar!  Modern warm wood covers the entire space and there is exposed brick on the bar side (left side).  Edison bulbs win the growler shades adorn the ceilings and give the bar a pretty great relaxed atmosphere.  Staff was super nice and made sure we were happy with how everything turned out.  I definitely will be back to partake in the 20 beers they have on tap.",

I think that's a pretty darn good deal, especially being in Uptown. For my two dogs I opted for the Cincinnati style & the New York style. If you're into carolina style with the slaw on it, it looked realllly good, I just don't care for slaw. My favorite was the cincinnati style (probably a little biased since I'm from Ohio). The cooked onions & mustard on it were awesome. The chili on both was exceptional, and couldn't can't go wrong. The fried jalapeno caps were a great side choice (watch out for the red ones mixed in ... they're HOT).   My only 'complaint' was that they got a little soggy. My recommendation for management would be to either toast the buns a wee bit, or not put the mustard on the bottom of the New York dog? Other than that, it was a great choice. The inside is small, but they've done it up very nice. I'll definitley be coming back!",

My QCBC (American) burger and my co-worker's Blackbean burger were ready within 10 minutes.  I'm a sucker for a nicely grilled bun so they pretty much had me right there. The meat was juicy and flavorful and the toppings were fresh and chilled.  It really hit the spot.  The fries were crunchy on the outside, but fluffy on the inside, which was perfect.  If I could suggest one thing, I'd say to give us a few more fries. But overall, it was excellent.  The staff was friendly and efficient. The building was a little cozy, but it had a nice atmosphere. Plus, there is additional seating outside.  Needless to say, we'll be back -- soon.",

You place your order and they serve it to you in paper/foam plates like a food truck.  Nice selection of beers, but here's the pro tip: Each day they have a \"Kick the Keg\" beer special, where they put 2 beers on sale and you can get a pitcher for like $7 or $8. Basically for the price of a beer anywhere else, you can get an entire pitcher. It may not be your favorite beer, but it's still solid and the volume pays for itself.  Have only tried the chili cheese fries and those were good. Service is friendly and fast, and the prices are fair. I would go back.",

For Midwesterners they've got the perfect chili for smothering all over a good old fashioned middle America style chili dog. ?Folks from the Southwest won't feel left out when they see the green chili on the menu. Granted, it's chicken instead of pork, but still pretty cool to see that green chili all the way out in Charlotte!

The bartender was really cool and he let us sample a few of the dark beers. Our favorite was definitely the Mexican chocolate stout (can't remember the exact name). We ordered the Bavarian pretzel with beer cheese to start, and my boyfriend ordered a burger and I ordered the buffalo chicken burger for lunch. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. If you're in the Charlotte area, you must stop here for some delicious food and a few beers!",

Beer came to my table cold and quick!  I ordered the Poutine. Classic fries with a rich dark gravy and real cheddar curds. The curds were just melting and super creamy.  Next came my Pim-Baco-Chee burger. 2 patties, nice soft bun and full of flavor.  On my next visit, I'll opt for the soft pretzel over the poutine. It was French fry overload with the poutine. Although, I could have asked for a different side.  Service was exceptional. Super friendly staff. Very attentive! If I lived in CLT, this would be a great hangout.",

She was very personable and took the time to explain the beer she had on tap.  This place doesn't have a lot of space inside but had plenty of room to accommodate our crew of 8. A few pub tables, larger tables in the middle, and a decent-sized bar. We didn't stay very long and I decided not to order any food as we already had plans. I heard they have great chili and looking back, it was a mistake not to do that as cold as it was.  I think this would be a cool spot to come back to. My instinct is that it would fill up relatively quickly, so perhaps a trip outside of peak hours would be the best call. It was minutes away from the marathon finish and turned out to be a no brainer to come here.",

    "text": "So finding a good quality restaurant open on a Sunday was found to be a little challenging but QCBC was open.  It's more of a bar/ but I saw the high reviews and blogs. The waitress was very kind. Prices seemed at first glance on par,  but not a bargain. i ordered a chili cheese fry as an appetizer. For $8.50 it seemed a little pricey for this item for how it was bought out.  For my meal, ordered the philysteak with a side salad $13. The Philly was served on a smaller sized toasted hot dog bun. The beef had very little flavor and was chewy. $1.50 for a soda with refills was the best deal here! Overall this place serves decent pub food which is always a bonus to have while your our drinking or just having a beer.  It's definitely not fine dining or the kind of pricing that would make you want to return just for the food.  I am being kind with a 4 out of 5 because nothing stood out here. For $25 it seemed pricey and basic.  If you do eat here get the $4 hot dogs -  $3 fries - Chilli and BEER because that's what this place is about. I can say they are kind and polite. This is a a perfect place for a snack (light eat) and a beer with a friend, but if your looking for a nice dinner experience with quality food, keep on looking!",

Any parent with a picky eater knows this can be a difficult task, finding one of the 3 things your kid will eat while also having a wide selection for yourself.   My oldest is always down for a burger (plain, literally meat and bread only) QCBC's menu was posted in the window of its storefront and we hit gold! Burgers for $6, pretzels (for the picky eater) and a Carolina style sloppy burger for mom...SCORE!  The bartender wasn't too attentive and seemed a little more interested in his beer drinking (and tipping customers) but I got his attention and placed an order. To my surprise dude stepped up and packed our stuff up for a great picnic lunch. He even asked how I wanted the fries packed and suggested separate so they don't get wet from the chili (however I would not mind but kids...).  We took our massive Togo order all packed with every utensil, condiment and plenty of napkins across the street to Romare Bearden Park and spread out in the sun at which time we laid out and devoured those burgers. The ratio of chili, slaw, onions, cheese and mustard to burger was perfect. Even the bun was amazing, grilled with a buttery crust which kept it from getting soggy. The pretzels were huge and fresh which is how I would explain the fries too.   This is my new burger joint and I intend to bring my family back. Until then I will stroll down to QCBC on my lunch breaks for some chili on the first cool fall day in uptown.",

    "text": "A Yelp find! Ol trusty Yelp machine at it again... A friend and I had just finished up at the Charlotte International Auto Show and decided to stick around Up/Downtown. The location wasn't what I originally pictured, but it was definitely a quaint little spot in the heart of the French Quarter. Apparently, it has recently changed to QCBC from a different format.  The bartender was very friendly offering suggestions when it came to food on the menu, the drinks on tap and other drinks she could make for you.  There are just shy of 20 rotating craft brews on tap, plus a selection of liquors if you dare. They have a special where you can get one beer and a select whiskey for $10.   We both ordered burgers. He went with the bartenders fave - the pimento cheese bacon burger , and I opted for the basic burger. All served with your choice of side item. They came out fairly quick and on no frills paper plates. The burger and fresh fries were very delicious! He was still hungry so he went back for seconds and ordered a loaded Carolina dog and devoured it -- says it was tasty. Against my better judgement I wanted something else as well so I put in an order of beer cheese fries. Man it came out steaming hot! It was tasty as well, but the beer cheese is very thin and 'soupy' .. booo! I wonder if there is a way to thicken it up a bit? It'd be even better!  Apparently, they are known for serving delicious chili. We'll have to make it back and give that a try! I'd go back for sure.",

You would think the chili would steal the show but it's really pretty bland and lacks that pizazz or spice I enjoy in a good chili.   Next, the beer selection... Lots of great, local choices on draft. 20 choices, to be exact. I like that they offer flights because I am indecisive and like to sample lots!   Lastly, the location... I love Brevard Court. It reminds me of a little alley in Europe. It's really an oasis right in the heart of uptown Charlotte. The interior of QCBC is nice, too. Lots of sleek wood. High top tables and a few seats at the bar. It's teeny-tiny though, so if anything is happening uptown (especially a Knights Game) expect a packed house.   So, moral of this story is, I wish they'd up their food game. I would be inclined to visit more if there was something I really loved and craved on the menu.",

The food came out fast and hot. The tomato soup was perfect it wasn't super creamy and it had very little chunks so you know it was homemade. The grilled cheese was phenomenal. We also ordered some fried pickles which were amazing as well. The owner Everett, came out to see how we were doing and how we liked everything. I went to school for culinary so some say I'm super picky. However I will definitely be going back and trying other menu items. They both made us feel at home.

But that chipotle mayo was 100z so goood. The fried pickles were over cooked and that was so disappointing. However the chili cheese fries all the way were very good but could have used some salt. The pieces were bad though. I spent about 10 on my meal.   It's really cool inside too but it is kind of small. There was outside seating too.",

Me and my hubs just happened upon this place after sitting at a neighboring establishment and having no one come to the table to greet us!  We walked in to be greeted immediately and within less than 2 minutes our drink orders were taken!! Friendly staff, super cool environment, somewhat like you would find in Asheville!! Food was amazing. Service was impeccable. Wings are a must try with the Jamaican Jerk dry rub along with the Poutine! (Fries with gravy and cheese curds) We will be going back!!",

I wanted to order a hotdog and a cup of chili but they don't serve cups of their chili. You have to order a full size which is pricey at $10 for the traditional. The chili came out and it was smaller than I excepted for $10 and it was barely warm.   This place seems to have steered away from the focus of chili, they offer a lot more sandwiches. While in the restaurant I noticed that several ppl didn't understand the system of ordering. They run table service but it seems like they have more take out orders. I would suggest that they block off the corner of the bar for people to walk up too like a register/Togo station.   Overpriced and very average would be my summary. I walked away after spending over $17 with tip and got only one dog and chili that was warm. JJs Red hot is within walking distance and I could have gotten a better dog for less!",

The place isn't that big, but it wasn't crowded to the point where I couldn't find seating. I was greeted right away by very friendly staff. I sat at the bar. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted and it was recommended that I tried one of the burgers.   I placed an order for the Kickstarter Burger. It came with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, chipotle mayo and Tabasco. It was very good. It wasn't too spicy if you don't like spicy food. The food came really quick. The burger came with fries and they were actually salted perfectly.   Normally for lunch, I feel like I'm waiting for my food forever. All in all, I was seated, placed my order, ate and paid, all in a matter of 30 minutes. Which is great, as it means I will for sure come back during my hectic lunch hour.",

Everett and a local at the bar gave us tips on what to do in Charlotte and what to do in the area as well. Such a tasty lunch. We loved the food, drinks and overall energy of the joint. Come here.
