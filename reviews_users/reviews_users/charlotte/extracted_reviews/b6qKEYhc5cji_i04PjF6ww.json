    "text": "My friends and I stopped by here one Sunday morning for lunch while we were in town. We had gotten there a little early and the restaurant wasn't open yet. We were content to sit in the car and wait the 20 minutes or so before the restaurant officially opened but this little old man, who I am assuming to be the owner, was standing outside as we drove up and motioned for us to come on in. He then preceded to walk inside the restaurant and turn on the OPEN sign, still 20 minutes early. When most people were fine with having customers wait in the parking lot until opening time, which we were prepared to do, it was a sweet gesture.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and can accommodate large groups. The decor is a bit outdated but clean. And the food is typical Japanese food excellently prepared with reasonable prices. Ishi is very generous with their portion sizes in my opinion. After lunch, we were all in food comas and had for force ourselves not to drive home and take naps. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive even though we were there early and probably intruding onto their own lunchtime before starting their shifts. I will definitely have to come here again next time I'm in town and craving Japanese food.",

Luckily, not too far away... it appears they've taken over a stand alone building in the same shopping center.  I cannot for the life of me remember what used to be here.  I need to come back and try their sushi again, but I had their Teriyaki Founder plate for lunch and it was great.  A good size plate of food that was very tasty and somewhat healthy.  Unfortunately I slathered on all the  shrimp sauce so, maybe it could have been healthy at one point.  I like the fact that the place is bigger so they can fit more people in, but it feels a bit \"too\" big if that makes any sense...  Also, I don't know how long ago they moved but there were some boxes and extra equipment that didn't seem correctly (just needs to be organized a bit).  There is a nice metallic blue color on the walls... but according to my color theory class in college, blue is an appetite suppressant.... That didn't necessarily stop me from eating as much as I did, but it was something I had in mind during the meal.  Overall a good lunch experience.  I'll have to get back here to try how their sushi is.  If I remember correctly it's a solid bet.",

The food is VERY quick, whether you choose to dine in the restaurant or take out.  Portions are large.  Their crab rangoon is the best I've ever had - stuffed so full of cream cheesey crabby oniony goodness.  The staff is always pleasant and very welcoming even when you just go in to pick up your take out order.    If this place ever offers delivery service, I will be in SERIOUS trouble.....  :-)",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ate here our first night in Charlotte, exhausted from moving into our college apartment. Immediately, we were in love.  However, the last few times I've been to Ishi, it has been very hit or miss. Also, our orders get screwed up pretty regularly. Just small things like zucchini and onion on the side rather than carrots, or terriyaki vegetables rather than Ishi vegetables. But the employees are all very nice and bring your food out quickly. The prices are reasonable, as well. The atmosphere is kinda strange, but I like it. I'm not even sure how to elaborate on that... The only issue is sometimes they play instrumentals of 80's hits very loudly and it can get a bit annoying.  My personal favorite is the Ishi vegetables, which is basically Hibachi vegetables in a creamy garlic sauce (although some days this entree seems better than others). Meanwhile, my boyfriend swears by the hibachi steak. All of the sushi I've had is pretty yummy, too.  At most Asian restaurants the crab rangoons, miso soup and clear soup are my favorites. But all of these items are just mediocre at Ishi. Surprisingly, the house salad is, as well. It's just lettuce and dressing. There's no tomato, cucumber, or anything that most other restaurants would include on their standard salad.  The two things I would avoid would be anything with scallops, and the hibachi udon entrees. The scallops do not taste fresh at all. I actually ended up picking them out of my meal, before. I'm not sure how to explain the udon, but it just wasn't good. Maybe the udon soup would be better.",

The staff is friendly to the predominantly college student crowd, always greeting and seating customers as soon as they come in. The atmosphere is fun, friendly, and inviting. Every time I've eaten here, dine in or carry out, the food is delicious and the service is quick and accurate.   When dining at Ishi, I strongly suggest that you dive head first into a plate of one of Ishi's succulent hibachi selections. With that being said I must admit, I'm a die hard Hibachi Chicken Addict! So much so, that the woman who works the register knows my dine-in and take-out orders to a tee, right down to my requests for no veggies and extra shrimp sauce. Now don't let my biased banter about the insanely delicious hibachi meals distract you from the plethora of scrumptious sushi selections Ishi has to offer. While I am not a sushi connoisseur, I must say that my friends who enjoy these savory seafood treats rave about their tasty goodness. Ishi's menu is chock-full of your Japanese food favorites, the only thing you have to do is make the painstaking decision of what you want to eat first.  While you're stuffing your face feel free to let your eyes wander around the restaurant. The ocean blue colored walls adorned with vibrant traditional Japanese decor provides a pleasant change from your everyday restaurant scenery. The bright white and smoldering black tables, chairs and booths add a casual elegance to the restaurant's atmosphere, making for an even more enjoyable dining experience. Ishi's convenient location to UNC Charlotte, and affordable prices make it the Hot Spot for college students and locals like myself. I definitely recommend this restaurant for everyone who loves Japanese food & rice done right! :) I know you'll enjoy it as much as I do!",

Why not this place since it was on the way home?  I should have listened to my gut upon arrival. I walked in the door to a very unpleasant fishy stench. 1st warning but I justified it with, well they do serve seafood. The smell was so bad I started looking around for the sanitation grade. 2nd warning I could not find it anywhere. I proceeded to order thinking who can really mess up a California roll with crab. The roll was just mehhhh!  The reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is there were a couple couples dining in while I was there. Also there were several to go orders waiting for pick up. They must be doing something right or at least there a a handful of people that enjoy it. Also I didn't get sick from the sushi :-). I can't say that I will be returning no matter how convenient they are.",

Roll was fresh and tasty, good spice and she put tobiko on top at my request.   We had the tempura ice cream for dessert at her recommendation-- first time I've enjoyed fried ice cream! Big serving-- would have been better to split than each order our own.  As opposed to the usual rice-krispies-around-ice-cream it was a dough shell.  The outside had been fried a little, but the inside was soft/cake-y from being close to the ice cream.  She said they'd been made earlier that day, so it wasn't warm, but still tasty.   I'm not a big fan of the actual entrees or lunch specials, though my roommate always gets them and enjoys. Definitely a good place to go for sushi.",

    "text": "I think Ishi is an unnoticed gem in the Charlotte sushi scene; I go there a lot and the food is always of consistent quality and they have a BIG variety of rolls. They're also one of the few restaurant in Charlotte that serves simple but quality hibachi entrees at fair prices, and fast!  I have to rave about their sushi because Ishi does not come off as a fancy, high-end sushi bar, but their rolls are fantastic! They must have a good chef because the special rolls are well put together and delicious, plus they are always tightly packed with perfectly cooked rice. Cold ingredients are cold and fried rolls have just the right amount of tempura. ALSO the presentation is great, the plates are always beautifully arranged and decorated! If you get hibachi, the shrimp sauce is not too runny and the meat is cooked to order and cut into small pieces rather than huge chunks. The meat and vegetables always taste fresh.  Their prices are extremely fair--maybe even a little low--for the quality and quantity of food they serve. The building they're in now seems a little too big for them and is poorly decorated; but like I said, this is not a high-end Asian steakhouse so maybe you should expect as much. The facility is usually pretty clean and the booths/tables are in good repair.  My only complaint is that the service is generally AWFUL. Their servers are obviously untrained and can get very obnoxious; when they hand you the menus (which, by the way, are paper ad sometimes re-used a few too many times before they are tossed) they expect you to know what you want right away, then come back too soon and repeatedly to nag you about your order. Usually the food is ready promptly, but once I waited 40 minutes for a simple sushi order while my boyfriend's hibachi meal arrived quickly--he was done eating before my food even got there. A few of the employees are very friendly, but most of them don't seem to care about the customers at all and it shows.  So: great food, lots of variety in the sushi, but get it to go if you don't want to deal with the shitty waiters!",

Ishi is a no frills, Japanese Hibachi place. I used to frequent here in college when I was low on cash and could get a good quality Japanese dinner for 5 bucks. You can't beat that.  The sushi isn't the best I've ever had, but it's not terrible either. I always get the Hibachi vegetables. I don't even normally like cooked carrots, but I find myself craving the cooked carrots here fairly often. Everything is always prepared and seasoned very well and the staff here is just as kind as can be!  Now, I am PICKY about restaurant cleanliness and lose my appetite at even the smallest infractions...but honestly, that's never happened here. I've never seen anything cringeworthy.  So, stop hating on Ishi for being something it's not: an upscale hibachi grill. This place is an essential for area college students.

The sushi, however, has always been on point for me and my husband.  The rolls are fantastic.  The rice has never been gummy.  The nigiri pieces are huge.  Prices are fair. And they make neat things out of oranges and fake leaves.  It's too bad, we live in the Matthews area... Sooo far - but worth the drive.  I gave it 4 stars because to be fair, I'm rating the restaurant and not just part of the restaurant's menu.  Hibachi - whatever.  Crap, no - Hibachi - standard.  Sushi - great.",

We ordered two tempura chicken rolls, a Bali Roll (mango, avocado and cucumber), and some fried rice with sweet tea.  Thank goodness for sweet tea (not a constant staple in the North)!  The tempura rolls were really good; the Bali Roll was something different and I enjoyed it.  The fried rice could have been fried more.  Overall, service was great as usual and the restaurant was not crowded between 1:30 - 2:30 pm which was great for us as the food arrived quickly.  I enjoy Ishi and was not disappointed during this visit.",

So far they're one of my favorite sushi joints in the free world.  I'm not a huge fan of their new location. The spacious emptiness of the old Taiyo restaurant really kills some of the intimacy that they had in their old corner location of the shopping center. They're so popular that I'm often surprised to see them so empty when I stop in. I do just chock it up to the larger floor plan and imagine they get hit hard by UNCC students on Thursday nights.  Sushi is the one way to go when you come here. You won't be disappointed! My biggest recommendation would have to be the Kamikaze roll. As always the staff is friendly. I do wonder if the rumors about management taking the servers' tips were ever True though.",

I've been to sushi places all over Charlotte, and none have compared to the taste of the shrimp tempura at this location! The maki roll is quite generous with the shrimp, which are a pretty good size, and extremely crisp too! While it's good on its own, I always like to order it with the shrimp sauce for dipping. For a little under $7 per roll, I'd say it's a steal for the quality!",

    "text": "Ive never written a yelp review but this one is worth it if it helps other people. I read the reviews for this place and had hope that it was decent sushi for a good price. Boy I was so wrong. I placed a pick up order and got there a little early, hoping to get a drink and finish up some work notes before my week starts. I ordered one of their beers on tap, and then realized where the tap was at. It was right next to the register area, and half of it was covered by cluter and paperwork, I don't even understand why that much stuff was collecting in their \"bar area\". My beer came in a literally frozen glass, there was an ice chunk with little black particles on the rim. I didn't think too much of the situation until after I took a sip... it was sour and rancid. I ordered a Blue Moon, one of the simplest beers to order, and it was absolutely terrible. The orange slice the register girl put on it looked like it was old and withered. When I got my take out order, I told her my beer didn't taste right so she asked if I wanted it off my check or if I wanted a new one. I didn't want to try anything else off their clutered tap area so I asked for it to be taken off my check. So she handed me $3 cash as a result.... Fast forward to me getting back to my hotel room to eat. First thing when I opened my bag, there was left over plastic wrap in there. At first glance I thought it might be maybe a fortune cookie but in was literally just trash thrown into my take out bag by accident probably. On my boxes there were labels, but they were written on the back side of table orders from 6pm! At this point I was extremely sceptical about even eating my food, but the reviews and pictures from this place were so great (and I had just spent $30) that I decided to eat it anyways. I got through about 4 pieces of the 3 rolls I ordered before I stopped myself. The salmon on top of my roll was warm like had been sitting out at room temp for too long and it freaked me out. The shrimp tempera inside my roll wasn't fresh, it was definitely precooked and soft/chewy, not crunchy like it should be. Every bite got worse after that. I was adsolutely disgusted. Even the seaweed wrap tasted terrible. I ended up spitting it out mid-chew and throwing the whole meal away from fear of it getting me sick. I am extremely disappointed by this whole experience. It doesn't make sense because the reviews and the pictures people have posted from this place looked amazing. I highly advise not wasting your time or money here.",

I sampled several, the spider roll was my least favorite..I'm not really sure why, but it just didn't work for me...the alaskan roll was good- I really like the avocado in that one.  The tempura tuna was really good and the sauce had quite a kick, but not overpowering for a first timer!  After looking over the sushi menu, I think I'd try some of the vegetarian options next time I'm at Ishi...  The waitress was patient while I asked questions and our glasses were never empty!

Food is overpriced big time.  For a hibachi meal you are going to pay $3+ more to get 2 kinds of meat than if you just have one and the waitress told me there is the amount of meat, the charge is just for getting different kinds....woah what a freaking rip off!!!!  Rice is crap....idk how else to say it, you can tell by looking at it that it is low quality.   I love ginger dressing...there's is pretty good but they literally put double the amount I would normally put on....and I put more dressing on salads than most people I know!   Sweet tea was EXTREMELY sweet.  Some may like that, again, I like it sweet but this was really over the top.   Recap:  more expensive than almost any japanese express restaurant and the food was mediocre.  Don't go here...why would you?",

However, not being much of a sushi lover, they had a good selection of hibachi entrees to choose from. i was content with the cost of my Ishi Shrimp selection ($7.25 plus 50 cents to add zucchini). The portion size was exactly right as I cleaned my plate and left with a full belly. Not to mention, it was solidly delicious.  I did try one of Mrs. P's sushi and i could barely get it all in my mouth, it was ginormous (twss). It wasn't too shabby tasting.   The interior of Ishi was kind of an ishi (as in issue...anyone? ...mrs. p?), although I was amused with the look of the sushi bar area (like a thatch roof Tiki vibe going on). The place actually had the appearance of a former Mexican restaurant and would probably not be the sushi place you go to impress a date.   However, i thought our service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly, helpful with suggestions and they were always on top of our water refills. We even got a fancified orange at the end of the meal and  mints with the check..   We do not venture to this area often enough to likely make a return trip but it was a very satisfying dinner.

I ordered the ishi steak also well done not md. like I requested, it was just so bland and greasy. The only good thing on my plate was the carrots. The service left alot to be desired as everyone was gathered around the TV watching American idol our waiter only checked on us once and never refilled my drink.

The restaurant had a wide open dining area and is one of the largest japanese restaurants I've been in.  The atmosphere was very laid back and casual and the dining area decor isn't anything fancy.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and the hostess was very friendly.  Our waitress was also extremely friendly and helped us make some of our sushi selections.  The menu is huge with lots of options for entrees other than sushi.  I ended up with 2 maki rolls that were both delicious.  The rolls were so large it was practically impossible to eat a piece in one bite which made things a little awkward...  Also both of the rolls I had were covered in lots of sauce and seasoning which made it difficult to distinguish the flavors of the different types of fish and other ingredients in the rolls.  The hubby got a shrimp hibachi meal that he seemed to enjoy.  I tried a couple bites of his meal and I wasn't impressed in comparison with my meal.  Everyone else in the group got sushi and they enjoyed theirs as well.  The prices were pretty good for the size of the rolls.  I'm still in search for some mind-blowing sushi in Charlotte but if I want lots of sushi for the money I'll come back here.",

We were sat in the a booth, which looked more thrifty than inviting.  It was somewhat busy for a Saturday lunch.  We began  by ordering hamachi kama as an appetizer, and even though I know it takes a while to make, but ended up arriving at our table well after the entrees we ordered. The hamachi kama came out a bit more browner in color than I am use to, but was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and moistness of the fish.  We also ordered a couple pieces of sashimi and one sushi roll.  The presentation looked a mess with everything just plopped on the plate.  The sashimi cut was jagged and the flavor did not taste up to par to what I am use to.  The sushi roll had cooked fish on the inside, but the sushi rice was flavorless and not quite what I was expecting.  We also ordered vegetable ramen noodle stir fry, but when it came it out, it was just overly oiled vegetable lo mien (like from any takeout chinese restaurant).    The servers however were quite attentive and helpful.  The price was low to average, but since I would rather pay to eat quality sushi, I do not think I will dine here again.",

As my fork wrestled with the last floret of broccoli on my plate, the sauce splashed across the front of my dress. LOL. I guess I need a napkin tucked into my collar as well!  Enjoyed myself, nonetheless. Try it!",

I always get the winter land roll and the key west. The sushi is not the only thing here either the dumplings are awesome. They have a website where you can order ahead and get your sushi right when you walk in. The service is speedy yet not rushed. Right after you finish eating and get a box, which you will need, the check is on its way. You aren't rushed out though and the atmosphere is inviting. The restaurant is completely clean and I just love this place. When your in that part of town with not a lot of options for food, I say you have to go check it out. Even if you don't like sushi, the sushi here doesn't taste all fishy and plain. This place is where it's at. Go Go Go. 5 stars for sure.",

Take out portions are larger than if you are eating in.  After eating here for the past 9 years I had never tried their sushi. My coworker wanted to go and so I decided to give it a try. Sushi was great! Many rolls to choose from and you can customize. The Green Mountain roll does it for me. Spicy tuna (my fav) and avocado on top. Yes!!  People are always nice and friendly too, esp the sushi maker (??) girl. Sometimes the music they play is oddly depressing though.  Also need to update the inside. Booths are worn out and the server station in middle of rest looks sketchy.",

The rice was softer than most places and it was hard to pick up the sushi pieces because they were falling apart from the rice being so soft... Overall, the experience was okay.

It's summer we go when we need something quick and not terrible for you. We regularly get spicy salmon sushi and hibachi or teriyaki chicken. Portions are always consistent for the price, and the vegetables are clearly fresh. We usually have the same server by chance and she always remembers our order. Give it a try just don't have the same expectations as a pricey restaurant.  If you want a meal for under $10 this is the place.",

    "text": "Let me first say that Ishi is THE best Japanese express restaurant that I have ever been to. I moved away from Charlotte a year and a half ago to Charleston, and afterwards to Jacksonville (FL), and haven't been able to find anything in comparison.   Ishi's food is always fresh, always tasty, and never disappoints. My go-to dishes are the Terriyaki Chicken and Terriyaki Steak. Today for lunch I got the Terriyaki Chicken with a side of ginger sauce, and it was everything I had remembered. The chicken is fresh and never dry, the broccoli is prepared in the typical hibachi fashion, and the sweet carrots are always a delight. Add their Terriyaki sauce, and you've found something close to heaven.  When I went to college at UNC Charlotte, I ate at Ishi once or twice a week (split time between Ishi and Toyama on Mallard Creek Church), and it's something I've missed over the past couple of years since moving away. The local college kids just don't know how good they have it!  I think it's also a good sign that some of the employees they had working today were there 2008 - 2010 when I was a \"regular\" during my college days.",

    "text": "Oh where to start. I was in search of Gyoza. They have Gyoza...that is where it all goes south. This place has 3 stars for a reason. 3 stars is really really high if you look at the ONE STAR I gave it.   It's a flipping train wreck. It is what every failing restaurant show is trying to fix X10. Everything is wrong with this place.  The outside should tell you not to enter. It's a mess and unkempt. Three feet in the door should have told you to just walk away but I wanted Gyoza.   The inside is an even bigger train wreck of a mess. I think it used to be a seafood/beach restaurant. It's just dirty. A quick walk around and you can see fingerprints and dirt everywhere. The inside of the place has not been cleaned in a long time.   The tables are all covered in some type of fake leather material and are ugly as sin.  There are piles of supplies all over the place like they can't figure out where to put anything and have run out of space. There is a back room that is filled with crap all the way to the ceiling.    The sushi bar looks dirty and if you look behind the bar you will see an even bigger mess. Just crap everywhere that does not belong. Everything feels broken and out of place. The bathrooms are not dirty but they are not clean either. You just don't get the feeling you should be in there and washing your hands is never going to make anything better.  The menu is a mile long. Way too long for anything in the back to be fresh.  Needless to say the Gyoza was either steamed or deep fried. Sorry you can't do that. Gyoza is pan fried and then steamed. So this trip was to prove that I would never go here again. When you put \"AUTHENTIC JAPANESE\" on the menu then you had better know what that means. Nothing in there is \"AUTHENTIC\" anything.  The lack of customers to chair ratio should have been another indicator of how bad this was going to be. During a lunch rush in the middle of a business area they should be packed but sadly they are not. Every restaurant in the area is busy like crazy during lunch and there are 10 cars in the lot and about 10% of the chairs with butts in them. That is a bad sign.  I can't stress this place is a mess. If you think it's \"OK\" or \"NOT THAT BAD\" then you clearly don't know what clean is or how a restaurant should look and operate. They should be closed down and a deep cleaning done along with a huge reduction in the menu for starters.  These people should not be running a restaurant at all!  I could go on and on but will just advise to not go here and waste your money. Any place that discounts bugs laying around and replies on Yelp is not to be trusted.   They are making excuses. Take your $10 - $15 and go next door to the McDonald's...even if you threw away the McDonald's after you purchase, it would be a better option than eating here. I am trying to save you!  PS - For anyone who gave it 3 or more stars....shame on you!",

I ordered the vegetable hibachi (comes with broccoli, carrots, sweet carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, and onions with rice, I asked for no mushrooms or carrots). The sauce and vegetables was just okay, but definitely edible. However, the rice (listed on the menu as fried rice) was just cooked white rice that contained peas, carrots, and onions. Honestly, rice is a make it or break it for me, and I could not even eat half of this rice. Just so gross.  However, the sushi my friends ordered was pretty good! Definitely try the Little Mermaid roll, it was very tasty.",

Good location in the University area is probably the main reason it does a good amount of lunch business.    I had the Deluxe Sushi Platter and it was filling because the rice balls were HUGE!  The pieces of fish topping them were also large which required quite the mouth calisthenics to maneuver them (especially the more chewy pieces like the octopus).  I say make the pieces smaller so they're easier to eat and add another one to the platter to make up for the lost volume.  The rice was appropriately sticky but flavorless and a the temperature wasn't quite right.  It was just okay, but it'll do when jonesing for raw fish.  The three star average rating of this place is pretty much spot on.",

I asked the waitress what would be the best for a beginner who doesn't fully want to commit to trying raw fish. She was super nice and recommend the \"Rock n roll\" roll... and it was AMAZING!! So this place has amazing sushi! (Wayyy better than the Harris teeter sushi.. does Harris teeter sushi even count??).   Ultimately if you are in the University area this is a hands down go to place for food!!",

Aaaand they do brown rice or seaweed for the super healthy person. I love the tuna lover roll and the hoki roll.  The largest roll ever is the super taiyo roll. Also a great choice and super filling.  Based on other reviews seem people don't care for hibachi but I only eat sushi and for that it's great.  It's a super casual place bit old and outdated not a great date spot but again for pure sushi food enjoyment (I sit at the bar) it's 5 stars for me.",

The rolls weren't tight and symmetrical like I'd expect from a 5 star sushi bar, but for $9.99 for 16 pieces of sushi it's hard to complain.  Fried rice side was ok, but nothing special.  I'm wondering how their specialty rolls would have been, but I'm more into traditional rolls like yellowtail scallion.    One thing I can say is that they have an overwhelmingly large menu, so there's definitely something here for everyone.",

I called while we were on the way there (terrible, I know) and asked if we could be seated and was assured we would.  We walked right in to a large table.  It was perfect.  We had three separate parties and there was no problem splitting checks, from the beginning.   I ordered the tempura veggies for the table and it was delicious - battered and fried zucchini, carrots, onions and mushrooms.  Very good and came piping hot.   Others at the table ordered hibachi entrees, which they said were very tasty and high quality.  I, myself, had two specialty rolls which were beautifully presented and amazingly huge and fresh.  The quality of the fish inside the rolls was commented on by all who had it.  Everything came out quickly and correctly.    Service was quite friendly - no complaints at all.  As expected, gratuity was added to the bill prior to payment.  No issues.  We'll be back to this place, for sure in the future.",

Although it's very close to UNCC the college crowds come and go in small groups and typically go unnoticed. Service is always friendly, its clearly a family business  and you can tell. The servers aren't always perfect but  consistently good. I'd love to see this place get a remodel. The ambiance could definitely use an upgrade. But I'll probably keep coming even if they never remodel, because the food is very consistently excellent.",

Since the sushi had to be remade and wasn't done until I finished our entrees, I had to take it to go and pay .50 cents for a shrimp sauce to go as well. Due to no bag given with my box I dropped my shrimp sauce outside and went back inside to request a new one and the management refused to give me another. Instead they insisted I repay and justified it by saying: \" I didn't drop it \" . Highly unprofessional customer service seeking just your money and not to give you a decent sushi experience at the very least.",

The decor and the booths and tables are a little bit older looking. Some of the booths have torn fabric. There is also this room off the of the dining room that looks like it's just used for storage. But all of it is pretty much in plain view. It's kind of weird.   The service is pretty good here usually. Last time my friend and I each ordered a beer to start. And then my friend switched to a soda and I ordered a water. My friend was asked if she would like a refill or a to go cup despite her soda was more full than my water and the server completely ignored my drink.   The price for the sushi is comparable to what you might expect at other sushi restaurants. Maybe a dollar or two cheaper on some of the rolls. The rolls here are all pretty good - but nothing spectacular or special. For that reason, whenever I am craving sushi I usually will opt to go to a different place. I usually only end up at Ishi if one of my friends chooses it.",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem in the University City are. The only star deduction I gave is because the interior is dated and not the \"cleanest\" to look with the dark interior and weird hodgepodge flooring. Don't let that deter you though. It is worth to try.  I usually go here for dinner, as I'm not in the area during the day, but I was able to look at their lunch specials and it looks decent.  There is never a wait, even at rush hour during dinner. I often observe they even cater to larger parties - so that's a hint at their good service.  If you want hibachi / teppanyaki, without the fancy entertainment show grill table side, come here. It tastes just as good and they even have a variety of combinations. There is a \"traditional\" teppanyaki restaurant further up the road and I prefer this over that, honestly I haven't even tried  that place, since I moved into the neighborhood....3 years ago.  My go to dish is the hibachi combination steak & shrimp w/vegetables. They have that combo without veggies too. The steak will be cooked to desired temperature - me at medium/rare - and shrimp are medium sized and juicy. Some places overcook them to a rubbery taste, but not this place. Their marinade pairs well with the broccoli, mushrooms and carrots. My only note is that the sweet carrots are a bit overcooked for my taste, sometimes I wonder if they are the canned ones, but oh well, I still eat them, but not my fave. You also get a shrimp sauce on the side.   Staff is always friendly and attentive. The lady at the register is soooooooo patient. Being in the university area, you occasionally get the drunk to-go order or walk-ins. Where I would be annoyed and couldn't hide it, she patiently waits to take their order and explains the same dish over and over again with a smile (probably stabbing your drunken eyes out with chop sticks). Props too her, and yep, that is why I couldn't work in the service industry.  Love this place.",

When we go out to other Japanese places we always find ourselves comparing that food on a scale to ishi cause to us, ishi is always the best. Over five years they have never gotten our order wrong, it's always fresh and delicious. If you haven't eaten here your missing out",

The sushi was good (my boyfriend's Tiger Roll tasted way better though), but I couldn't get enough of the crab salad. It was probably the best crab salad I've ever had. It was so crunchy and delicious. It sits on top of a huge piece of lettuce which I like to use as a lettuce wrap for the salad when I'm almost finished. The crab meat is so sweet and decadent. Only giving them 4 stars because the sushi was kinda subpar but the crunchy Crab salad won my heart. Great prices for the Hibachi as well.",

We ordered fewer sushi rolls than we usually do, figuring that it was just lunch, no need to fill up.  But when the sushi came the rolls were huge!  At least 10 large pieces per roll.  We could barely finish.  It was great.  The tuna we had was super fresh and delicious.  The only reason this review is missing a star is because the restaurant could use some updates and the bathrooms are pretty dingy.  Also, at first entering the restaurant it kind of scares you because the first thing you smell is that weird bathroom cleaner smell.",

I ordered the chicken teriyaki with friend rice and the California roll sushi which was about $13. The fried rice came with shrimp sauce and that seemed to be too runny. Also the teriyaki chicken seemed to be too under seasoned and fried to death (too dry). The rice was mediocre and sticking together. The sushi arrived hot, the avocado in it tasted old and so did the crab meat. There was no flavor in the sushi whatsoever. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend took his meal in a to go box as well and when he tried to reheat it later it smelled horrible. I suggest that if you want some delicious Japanese food then skip this location. Pay some more money and get better quality food elsewhere. I'm very disappointed at this location and I wish I could give them less than one star. Even an Asian buffet can do better than this.",

Having spent 7 years working in the restaurant industry, I have learned that there's a good correlation to condition of the bathrooms and the overall hygiene in the kitchen.  While some places can slip on hygiene (provided they deep fry everything and serve it hot), sushi cannot.  Poor hygiene leads to an unhappy digestive system.     Had I not already ordered my food, I would have left after using the restrooms.    I stumbled in here by accident and I would be happy to not try it again.    Overall the quality and flavor of the sushi was about as good as a supermarket.  It was not bad, per se.  But, it certainly was not good.  I would not recommend Ishi for sushi.    The atmosphere gets a 2 out of 5.  Service gets a 2 out of 5.    I recommend a \"pass\" when you are in the mood for sushi.",

I used to eat at Ishi quite often, however it's been about a year since my last visit. Had nothing to do with them, just sorta happened that way (working from home a lot more, etc).  Since then, they've moved into a new building across from the strip mall they used to be in (formerly Fudruckers then Taiyo).  Much larger space, which is great , however the interior has sort of a \"design on a dime\" look to me.  Considering I got my lunch to go, I didn't have time to really evaluate things that closely, so I can't fairly evaluate/rate the ambiance, other than it being rather dark (lots of black).  I've eaten here twice now in the last week & a half, and I have to say, they just don't do it for me anymore.  And that saddens me because the family that owns/runs Ishi is great. Food is still fairly yummy, however the value isn't as good as it once was (ie: I've noticed a steep increase in price w/nothing to show for it).  Meals come with either a side salad or soup at other places, but not here.  I'm a creature of habit, so as usual, I order a chicken/shrimp hibachi combo.  $12.  Used to be around $8.  Portion sizes are plentiful, so kudos for that, and service is speedy and friendly.  However for my dollar, I can go about two blocks away to Kabuto and nosh on a far superior meal for the same price (and the rice is 10x better...and, if you have the time, you get a show!).  Granted, unlike many of their competitors, Ishi's pricing remains the same at dinner, so that's a plus (portion sizes are the same at lunch and dinner).    I tried their clear onion soup the other day and was RATHER disappointed; tasted like a watered down French onion soup to me - kinda icky; not the \"clean\" flavor I'm accustomed to.    All-in-all, Ishi is no longer on my go-to list unless I'm in a hurry or going with others.  If I do go, I think I'll just get Hibachi Shrimp & sub out the rice for zucchini & onion.  At least the owners & staff are still friendly - that get's them an additional star!",

Also to to left of the sushi bar is a Bar with very cheap drinks! The waiters and waitresses are not too invasive and will not distract your conversation while they are dropping off food or refilling drinks. Also have ordered takeout from Ishi many times, Mmmmm thinking about it makes me want to eat there tonight! The environment of Ishi is not so super nice and almost looks outdated and unchanged over the many years of great use! I don't mind it at all, Its always great to step out of the normal upscale places i frequent.",

We order our rolls without sesame on them (we like them on the side) but they came with them, no biggie. The rolls were not the best we've had but they were good. The chef gave us a complimentary orange and a box of chopsticks. We will try this again sometime to compare and update our review.",

    "text": "Co-workers of mine from work raved about Ishi so they wanted to take me there for lunch.  I agreed -- hey, who am I to argue about food?  We walked in and I noticed that there wasn't much ambiance to the restaurant at all.  It's one big room, tables lined up one next to the other.  Nothing special.  It reminded me of a mom-and-pop restaurant \"back in the day.\"    Their menu is pretty extensive with sushi and hibachi items.  Not wanting to hold everyone up and read through each and every sushi item (and not really in the mood for sushi), I ordered a hibachi item like everyone else.  I went with the Hibachi Chicken.  It was good...but really no better than a frozen \"Chinese\" item you pick up from your local grocery store.  The shrimp sauce dip was a nice touch and it gave the rest some flavor, but I tried not to imagine how many calories were in that creamy pink sauce that I dipped my entire lunch into.    All in all, I spent about $10 with the entree, drink, and tip (for which we only saw the server briefly during the order, food delivery, and bill drop-off).  I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to go back.  There are better lunch choices in the area.  But if my co-workers had a desire to go there again with me, I'd probably go and maybe give their sushi a try (although then I'd end up spending even more for a quick lunch than with the Hibachi entree).",

Although, I heard they have moved to a new location so that may have changed.  This place is simple and to the point.  It's cheap.  It's quick.  It's delicious.

Was told it was the previous restaurants owners disposable menu used to order from the sushi bar, hence all the checkmarks, but they recycled as their menu.  The spring rolls sat in a puddle of grease on the plate, and they were mushy inside. (appeared frozen and dumped into the oil ) They were so greasy when picking them up my fingers glistened.   The tempura was not tempura batter but rather the batter you would expect on fish n chips.  That also had a shiny sheen of grease. The chicken was dry inside and It was also tastless and bland. Greasey shell on top of tasteless dry chicken.  Felt nauseous from all the grease and couldn't finish. Ewwwwww",

I've been to my fair share of sushi bars, and this is one of the better ones! The menu is extensive, with over 2 pages of just sushi rolls and pieces. The prices are great, which always makes me skeptical. However, the food arrived quickly (despite them apologizing for a wait) and was well presented. My only comment would be that they slice the rolls thinner - next time I'll request they slice 8 out of the same roll.  Service was good, very attentive staff.   Absolutely recommend this to any sushi lover!",

I ordered a TNT roll as well as the Alaskan roll and also tried some of my family's dishes.  The food here is just mediocre.  It wasn't bad but it definitely was not good.    Service was fast but the employees (and manager) didn't really seem like they were happy to be there and were very unenthusiastic.  Some tables had the low sodium soy sauce and some tables didn't which was weird.  Also, one of the servers AND the sushi cook was wearing a baseball cap with NY on it... very unprofessional.    This is supposed to be a Japanese restaurant but it looks very Hawaiian-themed, which really didn't make any sense.  What was more confusing was the fact that they were playing jazz music very loudly.    Overall, this place just doesn't make any sense.  I give it 2 stars because the portions were good and prices for sushi were decent.  Other than that, this place needs a huge makeover and I wouldn't recommend coming here unless it's your last resort.",
