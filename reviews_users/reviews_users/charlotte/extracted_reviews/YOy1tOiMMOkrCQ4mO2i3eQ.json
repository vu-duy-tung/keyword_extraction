I would have preferred the gravy be a little thicker and maybe spicier but in all it was pretty good. The grits had a good consistency and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My mother had a large breakfast, I can't remember the name of it, but it was way more than she could eat. She had pancakes, grits and eggs over medium. She thought all of it was delicious as well. The waitress was really good until the end, it took a really long time to get the check. I will be trying the diner again for lunch or dinner. I would recommend it.",

My mother had a BLT with fresh fruit and my daughter was going to eat the meatloaf. The meatloaf came with mashed potatoes with gravy. She didn't like the meatloaf because it was very dry and it was burnt a bit. They generally serve the meatloaf with gravy on it but my daughter didn't want the gravy on the meatloaf so the dryness is probably normally hidden that way. We ended up changing that out for chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders were good and they came with two sides. My daughter chose French fries and coleslaw. Both sides were good to her also. We did not try dessert because we were full but we were offered dessert. Our waitress was very friendly and this is somewhere I would go again.",

Service was on point for us, but I watched other servers walk around without noticing our empty water glasses and i even saw one server eat a French fry off of someone else's plate while delivering the food. We had a few issues and the bald male manager walked by our table multiple times and never stopped to see what was wrong but went to every other table around us. Needless to say, after three months away, we came back today. When we walked in, we were greeted by such a lovely woman who was incredibly kind. We saw Dana in the corner taking care of another table but we asked the woman if it was possible to sit with her since she was our go to server when we used to dine here. The woman looked at us and said that she was so happy to hear that because Dana was her daughter. We are so thrilled to be back and even more so now that we know not just Dana but her mother too. We will be back soon!",

My biggest complaint is that the restrooms do not have a sanitary location to change diapers. They do not have changing tables in either restroom and so you are forced to use the floor or the counter next to the sink. When I mentioned this to the manager, it was suggested that I use a row of extra chairs in the hallway like other parents. He let me know they don't have changing tables based on limited space available in the handicap stalls and ADA requirements for space. We've been back multiple times and they still do not have a solution in place for this. For a restaurant that caters to kids, this is a big gap that needs to be addressed.",

Greek omelette was ok but lacking in filling, hardly any feta.  Kiddo's pancakes were nothing special.   Chicken and waffles were very tasty, especially the light and fluffy waffles. For some reason the food took forever to come out of the kitchen and then only half the chicken, with the last piece being delivered after we were most of the way through the meal.  Making hungry kids wait for food is not a way to get repeat customers.  Waitress was nothing special, never refilled our drinks or even stop by to check on us while we waited extra long for the food to appear with no explanation or apologies.  Second visit: as bad as the first.  Once again the chicken and  waffles were great, and the shrimp and grits were very tasty though I needed a bit more grit cakes to go with the gravy.  The common issue here was the server. She had a party to take care of and no attention paid during the meal.  She dropped the bill and we waited 20 min for her not to come back.  When we asked the hostess to send her over, still no server.  Finally my wife threatened to walk out on the bill and someone else was able to run our card.  Worst service ever.    Consistently crappy service seems to be the same story I gather from just about everyone.   The staff at various stores in the plaza have said it, as well as multiple friends and acquaintances we have talked to.  Surprised at the high star rating in Yelp.",

Truthfully I would have been happier with bojangles chicken. And for 15 bucks I was expecting some seriously good chicken, but that wasn't the case. The service was good so I'll give them 3 stars.",

    "text": "New to Charlotte, I had never heard of Metro Diner. It had a cool neon sign so we figured we would give it a whirl.   The menu is overwhelming but in a good way. So many choices that it was tough to narrow it down. Our waitress let us know of the specials that day and we both (without sharing) decided on the Chicken Alfredo and garlic bread. It was exceptional. Portions were large!   Our service was great as my drink was never empty. They even took our order with an iPad which sent it directly to the kitchen. I like those fancy gizmos and doodads if it means my food comes out quicker!  We will definitely return and next time try the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter! Yum!",

    "text": "We are huge fans of Metro in Vegas, they score high marks across the board...at all levels which encompasses their very friendly host, staff and of course their food is the best!!   This location \"fell short\" :( ...first impression is the last & the host tonight did not even  acknowledge us when we entered the restaurant. What happen to \"welcome, good evening\" she did not even express a happy smile. BAD! We felt awkward, to say the least. She seems unhappy to be there and it effected our initial impression on this particular Metro location.  Not sure what management is thinking to place a greeter (host) with no inclination to welcome it's patrons. :( NOT BUENO!   Our server was very accommodating and serviceable ...although my cheddar & ham sandwich had a terrible appearance as the slice of cheese was hard and looked awful. Server took it back & had it melted, much better albeit would never order again.   My husband enjoyed his chicken & waffles, Vegas location had a tastier fried chicken. Not sure what is going on at this location ...it's under par in comparison to the Vegas location which is a bummer as I live in NC (at this time) not Vegas.   The manager checked in on our table which was nice .....overall we were bummed as we were expecting a similar experience like we had in Vegas.   *NOTE I believe it's lack of training and/OR this individual is just not cut out to run front of house. Everyone wants to feel welcomed irregardless of how good the food may be.",

I cannot remember exactly but it included a different bean in it but it still tasted great.   The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is due to the long wait time. The staff uses iPads to take orders but it took more than 30 minutes for all of our food to be ready for a four-person table.  I have been part of a family that have run multiple restaurants and I understand it can become hectic but this cannot be an excuse when you are a diner.",

But I'm going to pretend that that didn't even happen because of how underwhelming it was. But the chicken and waffle was one of the best that I've had. The chicken was seasoned pretty well and the portion given was pretty large. I'm pretty sure I got one leg, one thigh, one wing, and one breast. The best part about the whole entire meal was the strawberry butter for the waffle. It both looks and taste just like strawberry ice cream. If I could just order a jar of that for home, I definitely would. I am not so much of a fan of their \"spicy syrup\"... It is pretty much just syrup mixed with Texas Pete. But overall this was a very good meal... And it's not that expensive. Also their food can be delivered via DoorDash.",

The vegetables in the pot roast were full of flavor too. The wife's Fried Chicken and waffles were juicy and went well with the fluffy waffles of love. The secret sauce was a balance of sweet, savory and spice. It did not  over power your taste buds with brute force. It politely said please try me and played well with the entire dish.  I saw the staff wash their hands constantly. The service by Mrs Bernadette made my bride and I feel like regulars on the first visit.  We will be back to see what other treasures are to be found.",

Only issue on the 2nd visit was my sweet tea tasted a little dated, and that was probably from being in the early dinner crowd where it was probably leftover from lunch.

    "text": "I have had breakfast and dinner at this location, and although the food is really good from what I have experienced, I witnessed a waitress encounter I will never forget. I dropped my wife off for a dentist appointment this week and decided to pop in and have some breakfast.  I was at the end of the row, and there was a couple of ladies with their kids further up the isle.  Then a woman and a guy sat down in front of me. The waitress, well I will just refer to her as \"Melissa\".  The woman in front of me started talking to the guy she was with, as \"Melissa\" was taking the ladies/kids order.  \"Melissa\" was rubbing her hand all over her face.  I saw her too, it was not an appropriate thing to be doing in the middle of this isle, as we were all prepared to have breakfast.  That is a bathroom moment.  It was not a few second thing either, she was acting like she was trying to stop a dripping nose, because her hand kept wiping her nose area, and then her mouth.  So the woman in front of me was quiet about it, but I saw her attempt to say something to \"Melissa\" quietly at the drink station.  I say it was quiet, because I couldn't hear her, she leaned in to speak to \"Melissa\", but it was the waitresses reaction that struck me.  She proceeded to go tell all the other waitresses about that conversation,  it was really obvious.  She would say something, look over at this poor lady who was sitting at the table, and then the next waitress would stare at the, guess who, the lady in front of me.  That was tact-less. A younger gal came over and told the woman in front of me that she would have a new server named Becky.  The woman in front of me was nice about all this, I heard her tell the gal that it was inappropriate that \"Melissa\" was touching the menus, dishes, and anything else, and didn't wash her hands, and that she shouldn't be touching her face at all near customers.  I totally agree.  She said \"Melissa\" told her that she did go wash her hands at the station before handling anything, but I was there, and no, she did pick up the menus and drinks.  So now this gal was trying to tell the customer she didn't see what she saw? That was not okay.  I wanted to say something, but I didn't. I should have. But \"Melissa's\" behavior over the issue was like a kid who got caught with their pants down and they get all hissy with the kids who saw it happen.  She should have apologized to this woman.  I saw her.  She did wipe her nose area several times and then immediately pick up the menus and went about her other duties. I may decide to eat there one more time, not sure yet..  But I will not be sitting in \"Melissa's\" station.  And if the waitresses are allowed to handle situations badly like she did, I will not give them another chance after that.",

    "text": "So here goes...recently my friends have been talking about how good the food is here, so I just had to try them out. While my friends frequent the huntersville location, I chose to come here because it's closer to my home. I ordered chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, and tenders and fries (for the kiddo). I guess I'll start with my sons order, he didn't like the tenders. They were \"too big\" so the size of them turned him off, but he did eat all the fries. In regards to the waffle itself, that strawberry butter they provide is so yummy. The fried chicken does not come as it appears in the stock photos. It's clear that they brine the chicken, because it does have a dark almost burnt appearance. However after giving the chicken a try it was actually yummy. However the chicken was a bit dry so much so that the chicken wing, I couldn't really enjoy. In regards to the shrimp and grits, I was definitely not prepared for what I received lol. I truly thought it was going to be a bowl of grits with just a few shrimp sprinkled on top. However what it was, was something like a grit cake, smothered in gravy, with not only shrimp but sausage. The way that is prepared is not something I am used to/familiar with, so much so that I don't think I'd order it again. I would still come back to enjoy the chicken and waffles though. I do wish they were open later, as most nights I don't get off until 8:30 pm and they close at 9pm. I think if they were open late night or even 24 hours they'd make a killing.",

I had no idea that is a chain but for all that, it was pretty good. The inside is modern and welcoming and there's seating outside too. I opted for a turkey dinner ($11) because who doesn't like a little Thanksgiving in April? It arrived quickly and was pretty huge in size.   The turkey was really good - not the gross \"loaf\" stuff and accompanied by real creamy mashed potatoes. I had a small sad because the turkey itself tasted great but was barely warm.   Service was great - nice all the way around and even hooked me up with a to-go iced tea. Would return.",

I ordered a cup of broccoli cheese soup, the soup of the day, and a club sandwich with fries. The Soup was filling with a lot of broccoli and cheese, served with crackers.  As for the club, they know what a club should be. The quantity of ham, turkey, bacon and cheese was balanced to perfection with lettuce and toasted bread.   Service was on point, however, I did feel a little rushed as they seem to want to push people in and out, which I get, turn tables. However, definitely don't like feeling rushed while enjoying any meal. I look forward to checking out they brunch items.",

Today I grabbed the Bissell which is 2 Eggs, Bacon, English Muffin, Cheese Grits and 2 Pancakes.    The biggest reason I go there is because of the great customer service.  Every time I'm greeted pretty much immediately when walking in.  No Apple Pay but Samsung Pay works phenomenal and they are cool with it.    They have pretty quick ticket times and always include the needed condiments and utensils needed with my meal.  Interestingly I've never been past the front of the restaurant but the cleanliness seems to be pretty good.  Apparently they have been visited by Food Network before.  I know one thing and that's I want to try the peach tea.  I will try it this week.  I think prices are a bit on the higher side so maybe they could come up with a rewards program and offer coupons of some kind.  Consider turning on online ordering because your POS already supports it I believe ask your provider.    I think y'all are pretty solid",

Food? DELICIOUS Service? EXCEPTIONAL (cool, fun, attentive staff) Portions? JUST RIGHT (plenty to fill up a hungry man-- so you'll probably have left overs) Price? REASONABLE! Our bill was $27, with a drink, an app, and two \"dinner plates.\" I consider that a win!!! The cornbread waffle app was great... very filling! I ordered the chicken parm... SO JUICY and delicious, wow!! Took home half bc I wasn't super hungry when we got there. My husband ordered the tender plate and switched the fries for the mashed potatoes.... and he basically licked his plate clean. Now we know why the locals eat here, bc why not visit here often? The home style food is just so delicious (it tastes like it's cooked with love -- I know that's dramatic, but seriously!). We came for dinner and will be coming back for breakfast soon!

It's in a decent strip mall and the spot use to be the seafood restaurant Pier 51 for those that remember.   Place was pretty hopping for a Sunday night which is a good sign.   Service was great (5/5) and the interior was fine as was the seating (5/5).  They have a drink spot where you can go and refill your beverage or coffee which was convenient but our waitress refilled our drinks for us.   I ordered the Monte cristo and it was pretty good but I don't know who could finish it;  I could only eat one section and my side of grits and had 3 leftover!  But it was tasty.  The grits were just ok howver. Wife had the club and she really enjoyed it.  Overall I'd say food was very good (5/5) We'll definitely come back and try other items from the extensive menu.",

I ordered the spicy honey chicken biscuit with hash browns and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles.Wow,the food was spectacular! It exceeded our expectations and throughput our visit our waitress,as well as other staff,regularly checked in with us asking us if we needed anything.We've never felt so genuinely welcome anywhere to be quite honest.We loved it so much we cancelled our reservation for dinner at Oak steakhouse and chose to return to Metro for our anniversary dinner without any regrets!  Moving from the west coast to the south hasn't been easy.When I lived in California,I dreamed about southern food and the southern hospitality that comes along with it.Sadly,in other restaurants,we've been ignored for the entirety of our visit other than ordering.There's been times when our waiters were clearly burdened by our questions.And there's been times when we've actually been turned away due to the building reaching \"capacity\" and we've seen multiple people be seated as soon as we made way for our car.Mere seconds later..  We've had some harrowing experiences to say the least..However,the experience we had here brought me to tears.I had to excuse myself and make my way to the restroom just so I wouldn't feel so ridiculous tearing up in public.Never have I felt so welcome in the south.Never.Metro Diner,thank you for making my southern food dreams a reality and for making me feel at home.Your staff is amazing and your food is phenomenal.I can't thank you or praise you enough and we will continue to dine here  every chance we get.",

I noticed that those waiting already had big mugs of hot coffee... so I popped my head in and asked if we might get some too... the hostess asked if we'd like to sit outside because no one wanted that table... so, as things turned out, we were seated nearly immediately!  What a happy accident...  I had the two egg breakfast... the bacon was crisp, my poached eggs were lovely (the side of hollandaise was way too big, but no matter), the GRITS were WONDERFUL, and the biscuits were fluffy, buttery, and delightful!

Also shout out to all the homies in the hood who never made it here. I'm living for all of us now. I pour out a little mimosa for the old school.",

    "text": "A Definite Winner. Good Comfort Food and Breakfast all day  After having read a couple of reviews from folks I respect, I bookmarked this place and made it a destination.  We completed that journey today and it was more than worth the drive down from Cornelius.  Got there right at 11:30 am were told it would be a 20 minute wait which turned into more like 30.  No problem. They did their best to accommodate customers which made the wait worthwhile.  We got seated right at 12 noon.  Very expansive menu with something for everyone.  My wife ordered tea unsweetened while I asked for 1/2 and 1/2 and good thing I did. I hate to think what the regular sweet tea would have tasted like because the 1/2 ans 1/2 was more than sweet enough.  My wife ordered the Pittsburgh Salad which is a steak salad. What do you expect from someone from the Burgh.  She ordered the steak medium which is exactly how it was prepared. Size of the salad is beyond belief.  As for myself, i ordered the Meatloaf Plate which is two slices of Meatloaf with Brown  Gravy on top and a good serving of Mashed Potatoes and Sauted Vegetables  Meat Loaf was a bit dry but had good taste and texture otherwise. Mashed Potatoes were excellent and the Veggies were perfect with just the right amount of crunch.  Very friendly staff and we did not want for anything  It's a bit noisy so don't be surpised.  Several minor things but not enough to reduce this great dining experience to a lower rating.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love diner food? I mean, breakfast served all day, hearty portions of deliciousness, country fried anything, it's just comfort food at its finest! Diner menus can always accommodate a crowd of different tastes, too. Really, I can't think of a reason not to visit.  I have been intending to try Metro Diner for some time, now. My boyfriend decided he wanted a cheeseburger and instead of just going along with his usual spots, we tried one of my bookmarks. He was so hungry, I think anything would have worked but we were very glad to visit here. Decent service, large portions and very clean. There were two of us, we had three entrees and two sides for $30.15. Not a bad way to fill you up! I had the 'Eggs, Hashbrowns and Toast', 'The Metro Pancake (12\")', and a side of Mac n Cheese. My boyfriend had the Western Omelet that came with hashbrowns and toast and a side of onion rings. Needless to say, we were hungry. The only comment that was made was, \"I wish the toast was already buttered\". Frankly, I'm fine buttering the bread myself, I like to have control of my condiments. To each their own.  How you pay was confusing at first. The waiter brought our bill, just the paper slip, to the table and wandered off. While I appreciate the time to finish my meal or hang out for a bit, he disappeared. It wasn't intentional because I saw him run around in the back a few times and it was obviously productive, but we had no idea if that meant we needed to take the check to the counter, or wait patiently for his return. Turns out, we needed to be patient. Either way, still happy about the overall experience.",

But it's hot sauce and syrup and it is amazing with the chicken. I added more hot sauce to mine though. And they give you half a chicken with the meal.

I have to say, it rates quite highly on the Benedict scale. I'd say better than Toast. The portion size was generous and they put a good amount of hollandaise sauce. (It's my pet peeve when they don't put enough and eggs Benny is dry.) great flavor of each component. My daughter got the chicken pot pie.. we were very impressed!! The creamy inside was perfectly complimented with the homemade biscuit on top that was so yummy we are going to try biscuits and gravy for the first time in our lives next time!

I thought last time it was a little salty too. But this time it was extremely salty and not just the crust but the meat too so I couldn't even peel off the skin to eat the meat. Also my 2 orders of hash browns weren't crunchy either. I really like metro diner but they seem to be going a little downhill from what I've heard from a few people. I really wish they'd get their crap together because we need you in Charlotte. I also wish they were open at least an hour later every night.",

A friend and I stumbled upon this magnificent diner after we finished a wonderfully relaxing morning of services at a near by spa (Natures Spa--AMAZING too)  We were fortunate to have Nikki (Nicole) as our waitress, the food was outstanding and she was just the icing on the cake! I felt like I'd known her all my life. She had such a happy, up beat spirit!  She was able to help us narrow down our selections after informing her of what we were considering and every recommendation she made was perfect.     Our feast included the Apple Yo Hala on the Square (This was a Sunday special). We also tried the regular menu Yo Hala on the Square and last but not least the chicken and waffles.  The Apple Yo Hala was AMAZING... the combination of the apples and cream cheese was an extremely tasty combination! We both preferred the Apple Yo Hala over the traditional banana.    The chicken and waffles were great! The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and light and moist on the inside.  The strawberry butter an added bonus!  The chicken.... ohhh the chicken... if you don't enjoy seasoned chicken stay away. This chicken had to be brined over night because it was soooooooo moist and was seasoned all the way to the bone! I have no clue what seasonings they used in the breading but it too was finger licking good.  The sweet tea was perfect too, wasn't watered down and the perfect amount of sugar (I don't like sweet tea that taste like it will give you diabetes)  I have recommend this diner to several friends already!  I will gladly make the 25 minute drive from my area to come back and explore more of the menu offerings as I'm confident I won't be disappointed!!  Liquor license should be issued in a few weeks and they'll begin serving \"adult\" beverages :)",

She asked us if onions,pepper and cheese were ok with our  hash browns and we said yes.  We got the food and the check at the same time . We realized we were upcharged for the topping on the hash browns so we were a little upset. She noticed we were upset and didn't come back to check on us at all after she dropped the food, the manager had to come over and help us. He said he would take off the upcharges but I insisted not to because we had eaten them, he did so anyways. The manager was really cool and said they take this as a learning experience.   Just wish she would've given better service, maybe she was having a bad day!",

Upon arriving, it looked like a ton of people so we thought we'd have have a wait but to our surprise we were seated right away. The menu was huge with lots of things to choice from, almost too big. I got chicken and waffles with a side of hash brown. My chicken was amazing, crispy well seasoned and so juicy and moist. Waffles were fluffy and the strawberry butter was a really nice touch. My chicken wasn't all ready at once so they brought me 2 pieces and as my other pieces were finishing they brought me the rest. I didn't have a problem with that because at least I had something to eat  and I wasn't just staring at everyone else while they ate. However, the chicken took so long the waitress gave us our bill before I even got the rest my chicken. obviously I felt rushed so I just asked for a box to take the rest home. Unfortunately, the chicken wasn't good reheated, skin got soggy and oil piled up on the bottom of the chicken and speaking of left overs- waffles aren't really good the next day, the texture was completely gone. My husband got the monte cristo, it sounded really good and looked amazing coming out, but realistically it's a fried mess. Not much meat or cheese on the sandwich, just bread x3 and batter, and again tasted gross reheated the next day. Realistically, I can't knock stars for food not being good for left overs, but for the fact that my entire meal didn't come out before my check- I can't give 5 stars.",

Quick and friend hosts combined with the same style wait staff got us off to a great start.  While there is plenty of seating inside, we decided to eat outside.  Now don't go thinking you're going to get some beautiful or picturesque view.  It's a parking lot but like old dogs, I like people and car watching from the porch.  The food was damn good.  It really does deserve the damn point of reference.  I had the breakfast burger and the wife had some of the best chicken salad she's had anywhere outside of the home (she's still holding strong to her recipe).  I looked over the menu and didn't see a thing that didn't look appealing in some sort or fashion.  Parking? Reference the view for the point.",

It came quickly and all the food was hot.  The fish had a nice crunchy flaky crust and the fries were cooked perfectly.  The inside of the fish had a slightly mushy texture that wasn't appealing, but quite frankly I was so hungry and the outside of it was tasty so I didn't say anything.  The side of slaw was also tasty and they have great iced tea.  So I give it 4 stars for the service and the food that was excellent.",

Make sure to ask your waitress for recommendations and substitution options because there sure are a lot. We've never been let down by the great service and great food. Large portions, restaurant is often crowded, but it won't take long for your food to come out. Make sure to try the cinnamon roll pancakes!",

So, with that said, I have visited this location twice within a month. A couple co-workers and myself made a lunch visit and I enjoyed my breakfast sandwich and fries.  My second visit was around the Holidays with my Parents in town visiting. We headed over for Saturday breakfast. Saturday draws quite the crowd for breakfast. We waited nearly thirty minutes for our table. But, it was all good - the food is definitely worth it. I chose the breakfast pie, added bacon with a side of grits. Very good pie indeed! I described it as basically being a inside out omelet! Yum. Grits were tasty as well. They charged an extra George Washington (that's $1) to add the bacon...   They must change the menu constantly, because I couldn't find the aforementioned breakfast sandwich on the menu during the second go 'round.  Can't wait to make it back.",

Ask for Dana, she is a very sweet, helpful and attentive waitress.  Each time I've tried something different but have never been disappointed. I've had the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter,talk about lick the plate chicken and waffles especially with the strawberry butter that goes with it. The special hot syrup is different and delicious twist to the normal chicken and waffles. I also have had the croissant French toast which is perfectly flaky and flavorful. My all time favorite there if you come during lunch is the bold city burger. The burger has cheese, bacon, sausage, and fried jalapenos. Did I say FRIED JALAPENOS!! So good.   I would definitely recommend this place it's open all day until 9 for breakfast and they have specials written on the board as well as the staff mentioning it upon being seated.",

There was a coffee pot off to the side for anyone wanting to self serve which was a nice gesture.  Our waiter was prompt, welcomed us to MD, & gave a brief presentation as it was out 1st time there. We had the chicken & Waffles along with the Holy Davoli Burger. I must say, that wassim of the best fried chicken I've had. It was well seasoned with a crunchy batter. It comes with half chicken (leg, thigh, wing, & breast) which was unbelievable. The waffles were perfect being soft in the middle while offering a slight crunch.    The Davoli burger was great too. If you can imagine, it's basically 2 grilled cheese sandwiches w/bacon, coleslaw, tomatoes, & a beef patty. It was enormous & delightful. All in all, this place is a must visit & a gem of an establishment.",

They tasted like those \" potato stix\" that come out of a can and are like 6 months old. Toast was soggy. I called and complained and the representative or manager did not address the issue or really apologize for the poor experience. The only things they did decent were grits and eggs sunny side up. $12  I couldve paid half that and just went to waffle house and it wouldve been just as good. Do yourself a favor and go to midnight diner, another broken or the terrace cafe for breakfast. Atleast until they can hire decent cooks.",

Hot chicken with a fluffy waffle and that butter has real chunks of strawberry.

It's a cute diner that has the old-time diner vibe, but everything is nicer and updated. Bonus: if you're waiting for a table you can grab a cup of coffee to sip on. Along with their normal menu, they have special items on the chalkboard. The staff was super friendly and quick-I always appreciate that they swipe your payment card at the table with an iPad instead of taking it away for 10min. As far as food, everything was excellent. Hubs had the chicken and waffles. It comes with four pieces of chicken, a waffle, and a delicious strawberry butter. The chicken is crisp and has a really good breading on it. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant. It was perfect. I'm a sucker for a good croissant and it was extremely filling. My parents got the western omelet, and the bissell breakfast with no complaints about anything. Everything is reasonably priced & cant wait to come back again.",

Overall, they did an excellent job on the food and it seems like a pretty solid place to eat. The service was very good, our waitress was knowledgeable and made great suggestions.  It wasn't busy when we went in and the food came out pretty quickly once we had finally decided on our meals.  Actually, I had such a hard time deciding that I got frustrated and just ordered the broccoli cheddar soup but I tasted everything that came to the table.  This is what we ordered in addition to the soup, Rueben sandwich(one of the best I've ever had), mashed potato and gravy(weren't hot, not bad, needed more gravy), pancakes(decent but a little dense), chicken tenders and housemade chips(yum and yum), eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and gravy(sausage in gravy had a weird taste, like it wasn't sausage but some other meat but it was palatable), my soup was good but it was lukewarm which was odd because it came out quickly, my 7 year old tasted it and loved it and said next time she was going to order that.  And the last thing was bacon which was yummy and crispy.  Overall the food was well presented, could have been hotter and the clear winners were the reuben, the soup and the tenders and chips.  Next time I'll try a burger or the shrimp and grits but I'm a fan and I will return.  That is all!",

I had the meatloaf. Tasty but not hot. Gravy was tasteless. The mashed potatoes were cold and the vegetables were burnt.  Coffee was not hot either. Have always enjoyed the Metro but the lack of diners on a Friday should have sent up a red alert.Wont be back.",

From the sweet ladies at the hostess stand, to our wonderful waitress, Brittany, and even the nice lady bringing around coffee; Everyone was nice and engaging.   My 12 year old ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes. We didn't notice (the very large picture and description) that CLEARLY stated that the dish included pecans (she allergic). When they brought out the dish we saw the pecans and advised them of her allergy. They quickly removed the dish, apologize (although it was not her fault) and the manager brought out a fresh order (minus the nuts) very quickly. Brittany conversed with the four kids at our table throughout the meal. They loved her!   All of our food was tasty. We had the pancakes, croissant French toast, honey chicken biscuit, waffles, the breakfast platter, a burger and turkey sausage. I didn't hear a single complaint. Everyone enjoyed their breakfast. Oh and the icy orange juice was a nice touch! We received our food promptly and everything was fresh and hot. Next time we are in Charlotte we will be sure to stop in again.",

It was easy to find and well put together. I really wanted to try the chicken and waffles but, my figure told me otherwise, so I went for the corned beef with red potatoes and pouched eggs, an order of turkey sausage on the side. (Lots of of protein here) I drizzled both eggs over the corned beef with some salt and pepper and dove it in. Never had pouched eggs but they were fantastic with the corned beef. It didn't get cover everything so the next time I will have four eggs instead of two. A glass of sweet tea to wash it all down; that had me fat and happy for the rest of the day. This meal wasn't too heavy at all. I made a three hour drive after this and wasn't even close to being sleepy. Don't know if it was all the protein or the portion size was just right. However, it was good eats!",

At least to me, as it is open 24/7, has a huge menu, offers breakfast, lunch and dinner and you can order whatever is on the menu regardless of what time of day you are there.  i would say it serves up American common or American comfort foods.  The basics plus some.  REMEMBER to look at the rear wall as they have a chalk-posted special board.  It took me three visits before I noticed it, so it kind of sneaks up on you, especially after you have already ordered your meal(s).  Agh!  Service is fast and friendly.  Servers treat you as a friend, along with being efficient and diligently taking down your substitutes or special requests.  And the kitchen comes through quickly and the orders come in as you requested and hot.   The location suffers being on that horribly busy section of Hwy 51/Pineville-Matthews Road, so exiting the parking lot is a right turn only situation.  Entering you have to know where you are so you can get through the traffic into the center turn lane or into the right lane, depending on your direction of travel.  Portions are very generous.  Wife had their bacon club sandwich and we gaped at the 8 slices of bacon inside.  I ordered the Metro Club and it was so thick with meat and cheese that I had to compress it to bite into it.  Both of those sandwiches are a great deal to eat and delicious.   Breakfasts are what I think breakfasts, American breakfasts, should be.  Three egg omelets and you name what you want in them.  Coffee continuously flows into your never empty cup.  And...best of all:  THEY SERVE REAL HASH BROWN POTATOES!  Yes, a miracle now-a-days with restaurants offering pan fried chunks of potato but calling them hash browns.  To me that is such a rip-off and those restaurants throw away lots of so-called hash browns every day.  But not at Metro Diner where the hash browns are what they are called and are very good.  You can tell that I really like hash browns.  And you can order them as a side or with your side of French fries.  A superlative option for a carbohydrate addict.  Good place all around.  As I work my way through the menu I can see the potential of more than three stars.",

    "text": "Great diner located just down from Carolina Place Mall. We arrived around 7:30 for a late dinner (they close at 8 during the week), we we're promptly greeted and seated in a booth. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. I ordered a Belgian Waffle, my husband ordered eggs with sausage and bacon, and our son got the kids chicken fingers with fruit. Our food arrived quickly and was delicious. The chicken fingers tasted just like fried chicken! The waffle was golden with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffy in the middle - make sure you try the strawberry butter with your waffle. I shared my husband's bacon, which was perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back to try the crossiant french toast!",

Just plain, mashed with no sauce or drippy butter. The roasted veg was equally as good. Hubs had the roasted turkey and he said it was quite tasty. The people we went with had meatloaf ( he said it was not bad) and the other had the chicken salad and said it was really good.  I definitely want to go back for breakfast.",

Not crazy about their coffee or orange juice. If you could overlook their drink options, the food is very good. The only other complaint I have is to make the menu a little more breakfast friendly on the weekend mornings. Worth a repeat visit though!",

    "text": "Metro Diner is the sort of place I've been looking for for a long while. When you don't want to go all the way into Uptown for Midnight, I can head here to Metro and be just as pleased with the food.  I stopped in Sunday morning before the after-church rush started and had a comfy seat at the counter. Facing into the kitchen, I was able to watch the food being prepared, see how clean and organized it is, and watch the meals be finalized before being brought out to diners. Interesting!  I stuck with simple stuff, the corned beef hash and poached eggs. They were *perfectly* poached and the hash was much more beef than potatoes. A nice large portion! Toast was done nicely and my meal was excellent. Great service, too.  I'll be looking forward to my return to Metro.",

    "text": "I finally took the hubby here. I had been to a Yelp event, but this was my first time on a normal night. It was very busy, but a hostess greeted us and sat us right away.   It seemed like after that, service was a little slow. People were running food like crazy, but it was just busy.   The food is awesome. Having tried a lot of the menu already, I decided to try the turkey plate. It was amazing. The turkey was tender and topped with a savory gravy. Sides included mashed red potatoes which were fluffy and buttery and sauteed squash and zucchini.  This may have been my favorite part of the dish. Not too buttery or overcooked and some crunch. It was so good, I wondered if they did Thanksgiving meals to go.  My husband ordered the Holy Divoli, which has been featured on DDD so you know it has to be crazy. This is no ordinary cheeseburger. They take two grilled cheese sandwiches that have bacon and tomato and use those as the bun! Then you have a very generous burger patty with a homemade pickle relish. And it comes with a side of fries. He wasn't able to finish.   If you're looking for comfort food and large portions, come here!",

It was like a cool combination of a new school diner with an old school touch. Folks that entered were told to have a seat and someone would be right over to assist them.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, listen here:  Chicken: You get an entire Half chicken, fried to the high heavens, hot, juicy, and perfect to fill your daily regret slot. This chicken was sooooooooo scrumptious! Seasoned to perfection. I didn't even consider the body fat repercussions! Holla.  Waffle: Nicely done basic waffle. The strawberry butter accompaniment was life.  I'll be back again and again.",

Flying solo, sat at the counter, which brings back memories of diners up north-comfort and home.  The food was good and the service also much better.  Loved talking with the chef. Went safe with a ham and cheese omelette, which came with hash browns and I also went with a biscuit. Everything was good, and the biscuit was huge!  I will come back and give their Eggs Benedict a try.  Arrived at 9, seated by the kitchen, seems like we were forgotten.  Had to look for someone to serve us, been here a half hour, have coffee, but no food yet.  After 20 minutes, finally got food, no one has come around to ask about our meal, no refill on coffee.  I ordered the Corn beef hash -- cooked on flat top, was crunchy.  I wouldn't order again.  My friend had the breakfast sandwich, which was cold, probably because it took 20 minutes to get food.  First time here,  not sure if I would come back. It's like our table was forgotten.  It want that busy, so service should have been better,  and food, nothing to write home about--very disappointed.  The manager, Keith, was very apologetic and does seem to care, and our waitress Sha was good--she was doing damage control.  We provided our feedback--let's see.",

Metro Diner is great the servers are very friendly and the food is great, you will not be disappointed. I've been here a couple of times and I can definitely say it's worth it. They've got flavored teas and the flavor changes every now and then. They also have a soup of the day but I've only seen it change twice hahaha but both the broccoli cheddar and the clam chowder were great. The meatloaf plate is awesome, I wish the chicken pot pie was a little more savory, it is a little bland in my opinion however still good. They recently added a Cajun chicken pasta and that has been my go to for a while! Metro Diner is great and I will keep going.",

When we sat down the waiter was very nice to us. my kids ordered from the kids menu. they are 7, 9 & 10. they ordered the waffle meal. I ordered my food as well. the kids food came first and to my surpsie it was very very little serving. my kids were shocked that they didnt get any eggs or meat to go along with their meal. and by the time they were done eating they were still very hungry. As soon as they finished i finally got my pancakes. so you can imagine how long it took. but the rest of my meal (eggs,toast, hashbrowns, ham) hadnt came out yet. I didnt want to seem rude so i waited about 10 minutes and still nothing. So I finally waved down the waitress. she told me they had to cut my ham fresh. apparently i was the only person in the restaurant who ordered ham. But i smiled and said ok. about 5 minutes later she finally cane backe at this time i was ready to go so i asked for a to go box. I asked her if i can get a discount and she said of course. to my surprise i only got 2$ discount after waiting a total of 40-50 minutes for my whole mean to come out. The food was good but i doubt i will come back. the kids serving is too small and with 3 kids i could have filled them up better with a $3 happy meal from mcdonalds.",

It was not at all as delicious as they made it out to be. Extremely heavy on the gravy and couldn't tell the difference between the grits and the gravy. My son said the pancakes were rubbery.  The waitress was friendly and overly attentive. She was a little mixed up with food and drink, but it was busy. Seating was a little crowded and weirdly positioned.

Upon our arrival we were told that  the wait could be up to 50 min, but we only waited about 25. We reviewed the menu as we waited. I decided on the chicken and waffles. The chicken was seasoned and fried to PERFECTION (wing, leg, thigh, breast) and the waffle was nice and fluffy, the strawberry butter was an awesome touch as well. The manager made rounds about 2-3 times during our visit, checking in on several guests to make sure everything was ok. Our waitress, Alice, was amazing! Very personable and attentive. I'll be sure to return soon. I'm excited to visit the new location in huntersville as well.",

It is a chain, so don't go in thinking it's a local thing - the decor is made to be retro, which we really like, but the positives to a chain restaurant are very much in play here... (I recognize there can be negatives to chains, but Metro hasn't showed those to negatives to us yet)! They're based out of Jacksonville FL and we've been to a number of their restaurants (including Vegas) and we can always rely on the staple items we enjoy for breakfast. My \"mini\" almost always gets the special pancake offering (cinnamon roll pancakes - O-M-G)! Hubs changes it up and rarely gets something that disappoints and I stick with the tried & True avocado toast with a side of egg-whites. I know, it sounds uber healthy and not filling enough, but trust me, the avocado toast is hardly wimpy and the bread is hearty! The Louisiana hot sauce is a great addition to any egg dish but it's spicier than Texas Pete or Tobasco, so be ready for some heat if you use it.... Overall, we're regulars and hope this place opens another location in Charlotte soon.",

They got us new cups and it tasted the same. We kept it, but it had a watered down odd taste, unlike last visit where it was very good. Secondly, my husband asked for his eggs over medium and they were served over hard. The manager came to check on us and we explained that he ordered his eggs over medium etc. He said he would get him some new over medium eggs, no problem. He returned with sunny side up eggs. We just said thank you, kinda shocked he didn't know the difference. Everyone was friendly, not the same vibe as our first visit though. We are just disappointed that the experience was so different than our first visit. We both ordered the huevos rancheros and it was a totally different presentation and flavor.",

I ordered the Crab Benedict, and wasn't disappointed. The hollandaise sauce was creamy, the eggs were perfect and the flavor combination was a winner. The crab was not lump crab, so don't expect Maryland quality crab meat. My husband, who normally does not order omelets, was tempted by the Meat Lover's omelet; he was pleasantly surprised- said it was great! Hash browns came with both our entrees and they were thin and crunchy- yum! The diner has a nice atmosphere with black and white tile floors, a counter with stools and  it was very clean. Nice crowd on Saturday at 5 with a large party in the back. Excellent service. The food is not inexpensive, but worth what you pay. I want to try the Turkey Pot Pie and Meatloaf, a few of their other recommended entrees. If you get a chance, try the Metro Diner!",

After yiu get a seat the menu is pretty extensive nd covered all the bases. We got our normal biscuits and gravy app to test the wters and was delighted to get crispy biscuits with soft centers and yummy gravy.  Next was our meals, the breakfast pie with cheese grits . The pie had such great flavor, the cheese mixture was awesome. The grits were cooked perfectly. I got the corned beef hash and I was so happy. The hash was real slow cooked corned beef that was very on point. Along with crispy potatos (like I asked) and perfectly cooked poached eggs. The sourdough bread ws lso on point. The staff was inviting and friendly and there was plenty of coverage for  busy morning. We even chatted with an owner and was delighted to hear the back story of the new place. We will return again Esp to try the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits :)",

Huevos Rancheros is as good as it gets.  Several takes on Eggs Benedict that others in my party really enjoyed.

I went with my young son, teenaged niece and nephew on a packed Friday evening.  It was about a 15 to 20 minutes wait for a table so we decided to stay in matthews vs riding to the Charlotte location which expressed no wait when I called. I got the chicken dinner which was absolutely delicious. More than possibly expected to eat in one meal. My nephew opted for a bacon croissant with home fried potatoes. With my little one getting chicken tenders with fries. The only person to experience an issue with their meal was my niece. Her burger was incorrect and upon realization the server (Jennifer) apologized and tried correcting the problem. Moments later a man appearing to be in management came over to apologize and explained how they do not work that way.  He promptly removed the burger from the bill to our amazement. We didn't ask nor expect for that to happen. Aside from the good being delicious the service will take them far. Treat yourself while in the area.  I look forward to experimenting with the menu on future visits.",

Went here with my Mr. About 4 times: the first time was their first Saturday open and it was awesome! Super friendly wait staff, Manager was super-schmoozy but over all nice and the food was on point! Second time with my 10 yr old, food was good but prices seemed like they almost doubled from our last visit...(shrugs)...fried chicken is the truth so we sucked it up... But the last two visits: I swear reality set in hard! Third visit for breakfast on an average Sat. Morning: 1 hr. wait...ok, but then another 20 min to have our order taken  and ANOTHER 40+ to get our food! Really?!?  People that came in after us got seated and we're eating before our food came. Our waiter was a space cadet!! He looked like he had a longgggggg night!  He was wandering around, kept staring at us and taking food all over the restaurant except to our table. Manager came over to apologize and gave free meal coupons because he was embarrassed. We swore we'd never come back.   And then tonight we went back! Space cadet was in rare form, but our waitress was unnecessarily rude! I ordered a plate that had 1/2 fried chicken which was too much so my Mr. Decided he would take the dark meat and order pancakes and eggs. Ok. This bi*^h got and attitude and started treating us funky because she thought we were sharing my plate! Wait...What?!? The rest of the staff kept staring at us, god knows what she told them-she thought we couldn't afford a meal cuz we had to share so there goes her tip! It was crazy. WRONG THOT!    Got our check and tossed my Discover card at her like girl bye!! Thanks for the effed up service because she didn't have the courtesy to clarify our order. The service here is the worse and they need retraining. That was truly our last time. Ever.",

We both ordered western omelettes and requested they make them frittata style where they beat the items into the eggs rather than fold the omelette with the items sitting in the middle.  So when the bill comes I see a $1.00 frittata charge for each omelette.  I questioned the waitress and she claims she didn't even know that it cost extra which I believe because she didn't mention it when we ordered it that way.  Now mind you, we didn't request extra ingredients.  All it takes is to beat the items into the eggs.  Why would that cost an additional 1.00 per omelette?  It doesn't make sense.  I have yet to go back and I'm not sure I will.  I don't like nickel & dime-ing and this really upset me especially since their pricing is already on the high side.",

Now, you must know that I'm a big Diner foodie and when I see one that has a whole bunch of cars out front,  then I pretty sure that I found a good one. Well, I found a good one! Went in and was greeted by a very friendly staffer, who immediately sat me. I chose to sit at the bar area so I could watch the cooks prepare the meals. I was in for breakfast, so I opted for the Classic Eggs Benedict. It came with hashbrowns. Both were delicious. I'll be back!!",

The menu is large because they offer brunch basically as well as breakfast and dinner. Mimosas and beer are options as well as wine. The portion sizes are unbelievable I promise the chicken and waffles plate had a half of chicken on it. The dinner is not a loud space even though its not a huge space. Our food was really good I had the holy davoli burger but changed it to turkey check out the pics it had egg on it which was a extra buck but worth it. the burger was in between two grilled cheese sandwiches with slaw tomato and bacon. The sandwich was huge of course I couldn't eat it all. My brother got the breakfast burger which had hash browns and egg on it he almost killed over trying to eat it all. check out the pics to see the food. My next trip im going to try the berry stuffed French toast",

    "text": "Very very delicious breakfast/brunch place in Pineville :-)  It's a neat little spot right next to Mr. Tokyo's Japanese restaurant and there were some people waiting outside. I felt like they weren't just there to enjoy the sun so I asked and they said it was the line for Mr. Tokyo. I let out a huge sigh of relief... btw it was 1:15 and the site said they closed at 2:30 so I didn't know what to expect!  Service was a decent speed, I think it took about ten minutes after I sat down for a server to come get me some water, and that was more than enough time to look at the menu. I won't deduct a star because that wasn't a big deal to me.  I ordered the cinnamon swirl pancakes with a spicy chicken biscuit and it came out in I think six minutes. Extremely fast and it looked phenomenal!! Check out my pics for some instant gratification. Pancakes were amazing... they had pecan chunks on them with some delicious frosting in the middle. The biscuit was awesome too! I wish it was a little spicier but that's just me.  Pancakes were $9.95 or something and he biscuit was like $4. Definitely doable prices.  Kristi was my server and she was very friendly. Thanks so much Kristi!",

BIG MISTAKE!!! We were seated right away but the waiter /waitress took over 10 minutes for someone to come take our order.  No one showed up, and the staff that was there acted like they were al on break. No one even came it offer us water or take a drink order. So we left and went to Stacks.  Better Food, Better Service.  Memo to metro: Be careful not to let a bunch of lazy kids ruin your reputation.",

They have daily $3 mimosas and Bloody Mary's and I can tell you the mimosas are both tasty and strong.   They also have a soda and coffee bar you can help yourself too if they're busy and you're waiting to get seated, or you just decided you want a drink or refill mid-meal.  The food has been consistently good as well.  I usually go with the Huevos Rancheros, but I keep meaning to try their chicken and waffles.  Just can't look past that high calorie count on it.  If you see country fried steak on their specials for the day, it's quite good too!",

Having just experienced Metro in Las Vegas, I was all in to get to this location while dropping guests off at nearby CLT Airport.  The food here is outstanding, and extremely fairly priced for nearly a farm to table experience!  My order of San Francisco Benedicts was a first for me, but after this experience, wont be the last!  Two English muffin halves with substituted sausage patties as the meat, two poached eggs, tomato slices, avocado slices, all covered in a rich hollandaise sauce!  The extremely well prepared Corn Beef Hash is served with two eggs done your way, potatoes, and delicious sourdough toast!  Perhaps the most outstanding thing they do here is their Fried Chicken and Waffles!  It's literally 1/2 a chicken that's battered and fried to perfection.  Served with a real Belgian waffle, not pancake mix, that's got a delicious strawberry butter jam for the accompanying spread.  There's protocol in place at each Metro Diner that's evident in the way you're greeted, apologies given when not greeted promptly, and the superb attitude throughout service!",

If you have not eaten there,- stop what you are doing, and go there right now! This place is AMAZING!  A friend and I were out shopping in Pineville, and decided to stop and see how their dinners were.  In a word, our dinners were PERFECT!  My friend ordered the pot roast dinner with a side of broccoli  for about $12. I was going to order the beef tips over noodles, but at the last minute changed my mind and got the chicken parm,- also about $12. Both dinners were served promptly, and were perfectly cooked.  My chicken parm came with 3 chicken breasts (the menu said two). The breading was on the darker side, and my first thought was that they would be over cooked and dry. I was completely wrong! The chicken was anything but dry. It was not mushy either,- but you could cut it easily with just a fork. Delicious!  My friends pot roast was equally tender.  We each took about 1/2 of our meals home to eat later.  The waitress asked me if I would be interested in desert. They had an apple crisp, - and being a sucker for a good desert, I said yes.  I was expecting a small piece, - maybe 3 or 4 inch square.  What I got was basically an entire apple pie tin sized desert,- which was also outstanding.  For $8!  Metro Diner rocks!  I will be back to try the beef tips in the near future. The menu is quite varied. If you want a great meal and at a rock bottom price, look no further.",

I love the decorations of the restaurant. \"Where the locals eat\" was a nice staple wall art and I also liked their \"menu of the day\" specials. It gives that authentic old school diner feel but also feels modern. I will start by saying the service was amazing. I haven't had that good of service in a long time. He really made sure we were taken care of and got whatever we needed quickly. We were one of the first people for dinner but he was still attentive when it started getting busy.  I got the Chicken Alfredo, it came with bacon and tomatoes. The pasta and extra things reminded me of pasta carbonara, if they added mushrooms I woulda been sold on that. Either way it was still delicious. My boyfriend got a breakfast combo called the Bissell Breakfast. He really enjoyed it. I give this place 4 and a half stars. I would give a 5 but my only complaint would be some of the menu items are overpriced. I've had the same style food for lower prices but I guess because this place is so popular the price doesn't make that big of a difference they can charge the price. I would definitely come back to try other menu items.",

My only gripe is that they used to have cups at the drink bar where you could get your own soda but, the health department allegedly made them get rid of it. They said they were going to get cup dispensers but, it has been months and they still don't have them so I think they may have given up on that idea.",

I looked at the menu and said let go here . We were greeted and seated promptly.  ServiceI have to put this disclaimer in immediately. My family can be very difficult to handle with all the special requests that come in waves. For some reason we can't give them at once. It actually annoys me every time. However, our waiter Kieran (Spelled wrong ) did not even blink an eye. He handled our requests like he knew our playbook. I suggest you ask for him. Very pleasant and inviting . Not a long wait for the food.   Food- I order the biscuits with gray and eggs. This was OUTSTANDING second to none.  Not to heavy , delicious, homemade biscuits worth the trip just for this meal.  My son had the cinnamon roll pancakes and his words verbatim- Best pancakes I ever had. I was a little offend since I felt like I was the pancake king. However, after a bite I couldn't argue . We had a side of home fries and this was don't judge a book by its cover. Presentation was rather plain but taste was not plain at all . Nothing left on the plate.  Daughter had the chicken and biscuit and also loved it. She usually offers a bite but never offered anyone. She just kept saying so so good.  Overall, a picky family was extremely extremely satisfied.  Would love to come back soon if ever in the area again. Love this place .   FYI - Owner works just as hard as the staff. Enough said!!",

Another great thing is they run a very tight ship and the food always comes out FAST.   We're serial brunchers and I love a unique avacado toast and Benedict as much as the next guy but sometimes you just want a good old fashioned simple down home breakfast.   Today I was craving chicken and waffles. Forget those waffles sold with wings or chicken tenders, you get a half chicken (breast, wing, leg & thigh)! Now that's a whole lotta chicken so thankfully they allow you to do a quarter chicken and I always get white meat only (breast & wing).   The waffles have powdered sugar an amazing strawberry butter. So yum! For the fried chicken they created sweet and spicy dipping sauce is a mix of Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. So good. They also have some bangin mimosas. Always a good choice.",

We were given great service and told of the specials (some very unique for breakfast/brunch). Food was quickly delivered and made exactly as ordered. Our server made a few rounds to check in on us and make sure we were set.  The owner of the restaurant also made it around to every table to wish them a happy Father's Day as well, and gave everyone a coupon for their next visit.  We found the food to be very good, great service, and good location as well. No complaints, this is a nice place to have a great meal. This is a definite repeat for us!",

Make sure you don't miss the the specials board or ask what the specials are   Hands down, my favorite breakfast spot in all of Charlotte.  It kills me that some people would wait up to and over an hour for bacon and eggs when you could go anywhere else or make it at home...   Proof in the pudding the breakfast innovations like strawberry butter and stuffed waffles you really can't get anywhere else.     The price point is more than fair when comparing to the sub par competition.  I absolutely love it here and as busy as they are the service each visit has taken pride in their work, prompt fast, friendly and suggestive.  I wish every restaurant could hire the management team here to train their service on the basics that's what I think of this place.   For their volume of business and being able to push out quality food, the kitchen staff - I salute you.   I have a passion for cooking and can definitely see the head chef does as well and it shows in the precision and speed",

So glad we did - fast service, great menu: pot roast, shrimp and grits, chicken fried steak, chicken and waffles, chicken parm, fish platter, meatloaf, breakfast for dinner, burgers, sandwiches, salads... and everything is VERY good.

I got the cheese grits on the side because they came highly recommended by the waitress, but they were way too watery and the cheese was very clumpy. I LOVE grits, but these were just not good and lacked the texture that grits should have.  All in all, I don't know that I would be back.

My mom loves their grits and I give them major props for that because grits ain't easy and especially making them for the masses.   I really love the self serve drink station they have up front for the waiting area. This a great way to keep customers happy while waiting for a table.

We had to wait just a few minutes to get a table at 11:30 on a Saturday. I had to get the chicken and waffles again -- they are the best I've ever had. The strawberry butter is a great addition and the chicken is so juicy and flavorful. We also got a pineapple french toast which was a special. It was stuffed with cream cheese, pineapple, and a brown sugar glaze. It was incredible.   The service is amazing here too. They are very attentive and you get your food pretty fast. They are more than happy to provide recommendations.   This is definitely a must try! They are doing some cool things with diner food and I'll be back again.",

I got the fried cod with french fries and a side salad. The cod was so tender and the breading was light. The tartar sauce was so good!!!! The side salad is a good portion plus it comes with a boiled egg! The fries were nice and crispy. My husband got the western omelette with fruit and hash browns and he loved it.   Overall, great experience and we can't wait to come back.",

My husband and I tried out Metro after I had a particularly long night shift (in which I requested he  make me pancakes and he countered with a suggestion to Metro Diner ha).   We were seated immediately because we chose to sit outside. Also we got here fairly early for a Saturday morning and the place filled up pretty quickly. Anyway, the great service started immediately.   I will say this: THEY HAVE $2.99 BLOODY MARYS AND MIMOSAS ALL DAY EVERY DAY!!!! I had to wait until 10am for mine, but what a steal. The waitress took our order, and informed me she would bring my my Bloody Mary as soon as she could, and 10:00 on the nose she was putting it on my table. It was a no frills drink but still tasty. And again, $2.99.   I ordered a Belgian waffle with fruit and chocolate chips, and my husband ordered crab cake Eggs Benedict. The plan was to split each dish but I think I had more than my fair share of each. The waffle was great, slight crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside, the fruit was fresh, and the whipped cream was spot on. The Benedict was even better (although that's comparing apples to oranges). The crab cakes had no fillers, which is kind of a requirement for a decent crab cake. The poached eggs were perfect and the sauce completed the ensemble. Yea I definitely ate more than half, sorry husband!!  Oh, and it took maybe 10 minutes for the food to come out! This place is a fine tuned machine and we will be returning!",

Yelp reviews said that Metro Diner serves the best fried chicken, maybe they were having an off day when I dined there because the chicken was not good.  In fact, it was a bit under cooked and took it home to smother it in gravy.   The fries and fruit were okay.  I ate the biscuit with preserves which was the best part of the meal.

We came here mostly because our teen daughter has a thing for diners and has had a cruddy day, and sadly, she's the only one in our family of 5 who was unimpressed tonight.  (According to her, hashbrowns were greasy, nothing tasted good.. I think she ate 5 bites in total.  Obviously, she's not herself today so mentally discard her pickiness!) She's still asking to come back again with us to try the pound cake French toast, so there's hope.  As for the rest of us -- teen boy loved his \"Challenge\" pancake -- and after that he dug into the second half of my fabulous huevos rancheros that I didn't have even a chance of finishing (SO MUCH FOOD!). I was absolutely smitten with my huevos rancheros until I made the mistake of trying hubby's chicken and waffles...  I have never had better fried chicken, their sweet/spicy sauce had zero appeal to me, but after hubby dipped a bite of his unbelievably good fried chicken into this (maple syrup and hot sauce?!!??) sauce and INSISTED that I try it... well, we're headed back (likely tomorrow) and I'm having the chicken and waffles (with strawberry butter - to die for!).  Hubby is planning to try the shrimp and grits - I expect he's thinking he'll scarf down any leftover chicken and waffles I have and end up with the best of both worlds.  I'm thinking he may lose a finger if he gets near my plate lol (yes THAT good!)  We eat out a LOT.  I can see where this place could easily become a multiple times/week habit and we have a good 25 minute drive to get there... Need a second location closer to Mint Hill (pretty please!)",

I got the Yo Halla (French toast with Challah bread, creeme cheese inside topped with berries.. I looooooved it!!!! Not too sweet (I was expecting a punch of sugar, which I'm not really into it... im glad it wasn't .....) My husband got the breakfast burger (burger with an egg) fries on side & that was big & juicy.... I definitely recommend this place & If i am ever around again I would definitely go back!!!",

    "text": "I officially have a new favorite breakfast spot. Visited the Pineville location of this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Before I made it out the door I had already planned my next visit and what I intended to eat. I have now visited twice and the second experience was just as good as the first.   Food:  The menu is big and so are the portions.  They have almost every classic diner dish you can think of. The difference is that there is something that elevates every dish and makes it better then you've ever experienced it. The Chicken and waffles for example is beyond perfect. They brine the chicken for about 18 hours before they will fry it. I watch a woman temp every piece of chicken she pulled out of the fryer to check for perfect doneness.  The skin is so crispy and delicious that even when I microwaved my leftovers, it was still perfectly crisp, (how do they do that?). I opted for a nutty waffle to accompany my chicken so they added almonds and pecans to it. Then my server came over and mixed spicy maple syrup together right at the table. The waffles had strawberry butter on top. The combination was sinful.  The huevos rancheros are amazing. The \"Yo Hala On The Square\" is one of their signature dishes and it definitely made me Challah...see what I did there? It's 2 slices of challah bread stuffed with bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese and hazelnut syrup, then prepared like french toast. Once plated it gets a generous helping of blueberry compote and sprinkled with powdered sugar. I almost lost my mind. The Charleston Shrimp and Grits are different from anywhere in town. Imagine shrimp, andouille  sausage, peppers and onions in a shrimp sauce poured over two grit cakes that are laced with cheese sau hisage and peppers and then garnish the whole thing with chopped bacon and green onion. The flavors meld together perfectly.  Service: Our server, Dana was amazing. She knew the menu inside and out and made great recommendations. My drink was magically full everytime I reached for it. My whole family had a great time. She even explained to us that there is a full self serve drink bar to take advantage of while waiting or on your way out. Overall it was an excellent experience.",

Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful since we hadn't eaten here before. Our food was prepared in under ten minutes and delivered to us. Our drinks stayed full and our plates were taken away immediately when we finished. Great service especially with the restaurant being so busy.

Overall, we had a great experience and I'd go back again.  But - I got a reuben, which was DRENCHED in 1000 Island dressing.  The sandwich was falling apart from being over saturated, so I scraped a bunch off and it was much more edible once I get rid of the mound of dressing.  Plenty of corned beef, light on the cheese and sauerkraut though. I had coleslaw as my side and it was surprisingly not as moist as I expect coleslaws to be.  It was flavored nicely, but I did expect the same amount of liquid excess that I didn't want on my sandwich.  It was a little odd for me.  I tried the hash browns, which needed salt and had a great crust, but the inside was much too tender for my liking.  The rest of the meal was uneventful.  We had a very efficient and friendly server and I would go back.  There were quite a few yummy looking breakfast items I think I'll try instead next time.",

I had a omelet, which was good, and hash browns, which were just a bit over.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros, which were also good, but the ratio of meat to beans, to sauce to cheese seemed a bit off (heavy on the beans).  The dish was really huge, so they could just reduce the beans and keep everything the same to make a better dish.  I'm sure we will give them another chance.",

Waited 25 minutes for the table. Once we got to the table the server pointed over to what was supposed to be a beverage bar. My question was if I'm tipping you 20% to wait on the table, don't you need to bring my beverage to me? Once the order was taken it took 25 minutes to get the food, when we receive the food we could tell that it had set in the window for quite some time. Fries were rubbery and cold and my reuben sandwich was cold but edible. One person at the table had breakfast and she said it was delicious one had chicken pot pie and said it was average.",

Needless to say it was a clean plate experience for hubby.  My waffle was crispy, light and delicious with a great strawberry butter!  Chicken was crispy and delish! As for service, Lamont was awesome.  He gave us great recommendations and was super attentive and pleasant!  We loved how the order was taken with an electronic device and you could pay at the table without ever losing sight of your card! We will be back to try more items that tantalized our tastebuds while they were served to other tables!",

The manager did stop by, offered to put in an order for something else, and he advised us to next time request that the french toast be cooked on the grill since they are originally fried. We declined his offer and thanked him. We appreciated his effort and thought.  Overall, after the second visit, I can't help but feel the food here lacks \"freshness\". Everything is either fried in funnel cake oil, drenched in bland sauces, overcooked, undercooked, or lacks depth of flavor.",

    "text": "We were in the area and yelped places to eat and saw the Metro Diner was close by with a four and a half star rating. We were greeted by a very friendly Hostess and also by a very friendly waitress. Nice comfortable diner. The place was busy at lunchtime  The waitress asked if we knew about the beverage bar and she explained that you go up to the bar yourself and help yourself to coffee , tea , soft drinks, etc. Plus one can take out  a beverage to go.  The cost is $  2.49 per person but does not include fruit juices or white or chocolate milk. To me this is a great idea,  the waitress doesn't have to run back with a coffee pot and ask if you want to refill or run back and forth to refill  a soda etc.  The menu had a large variety of breakfast choices, pancakes ,waffles omelets, egg dishes,  many  breakfast sides a plus lunchtime/ dinner menus featuring comfort foods and lunch/ dinner sides , plus daily board specials . One can order anything on the menu anytime of the day.  Across from our booth the diners ate the peach pancake special and waffles with fruit,  so it must have been good  as they polished their plates clean.  We decided to have lunch  so we ordered the broccoli cheddar cheese soup,  my dining mate ordered the Southwest wrap and I ordered their chicken salad atop a garden salad with blue cheese dressing on the side.  We both agreed the soup was very delicious, loaded with broccoli and cheese and came out hot. My dining mate really enjoyed the Southwest wrap special.  I had a taste and agreed it was excellent, loaded with tasty chicken,  black beans, veges etc.  He didn't particularly care for the side he ordered,  homemade potato chips as they were extremely hard and crunchy to his taste. The chicken salad  which was described as loaded with grapes ,celery,  and pecans ,was not  , although it was tasty it was a bit on the salty side to my taste. Unfortunately the blue cheese salad dressing I ask for ,  I did not care for, one of the worst I tasted.  It was extremely salty and didn't taste from blue cheese at all.  I had my dining mate taste it and he agreed that it was overly salty .  So some food tasted great, others did not. Food was plated nicely. Good portion size,  menu prices moderate with many  menu choices plus a kid's menu. Service we experienced was great. We would certainly come back again and try something different from the menu.   .",

I had the monte cristo, my daughter had chicken tenders (such as all other 9 year olds), and my dad wasn't too hungry so he got avocado toast and a some cheddar broccoli soup. The monte cristo is AMAZING and HUGE. I took half home and it's going to make a great breakfast lol / I loved the sweet/salty fried deliciousness. My dad enjoyed his soup and the toast from avocado was burnt unfortunately, he enjoyed it regardless. My daughter's chicken tenders looked like all chicken tenders so I didn't take a photo haha - the breading was very flavorful and the chicken was juicy. Definitely coming back again",

    "text": "Portions are huge, and the food is amazing.  It will be hard to choose what to eat - so bring a friend to share something with!  The Croissant French Toast is out of this world, it's moist, crisp, delicate, and buttery all at once!  The problem is you'll have to choose between that and the Chicken and Waffles, which come with a Strawberry Whipped butter.  I literally ate the strawberry butter like ice cream - my heart doesn't feel good, but my taste buds said it was worth it!    The only issue with the Chicken and Waffles is that you have to make a decision on what to dip your chicken in: the strawberry butter?  Some syrup with a little waffle?  Or do you use the house made BBQ sauce, that is smoky and spicy with a great flavor?    Not there for breakfast or want more of a lunch or dinner option?  You have to consider the Huevos Rancheros - large chips with beans, salsa, cheese, your choice of eggs, and my favorite - FRIED JALAPENOS!  They are soooooo tasty to pick off and eat.    Think you can handle any dish?  Then order the Holy Davoli Burger.  The patty is well sized, cooked to pink in the middle burger and then placed between a pair of grilled cheese sandwiches with some pickle slaw...it's more than a mouthful to bite!  And yes, I said a PAIR of grilled cheese sandwiches!  One with tomatoes, the other with bacon!  I have already sent a few friend over to you - who are asking what to try - and I don't have a single answer for them, just to try it all!!!",

    "text": "To bypass any of our favorite Charlotte breakfast haunts to try a new one is difficult choice, but based upon the its positive reviews, we decided that this four week old diner was worth the risk. Everything was excellent as reported. The food was hot, tasty and plentiful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. Sanitation score was an acceptable 97 and prices were reasonable.   After a five minute wait, we ordered breakfast at around 9 o'clock on a Saturday morning. Both the hostess and our server, Nicole, were very friendly from the onset. We tried the Bissell breakfast at $9.49 and it included two eggs, bacon, hashbrowns or cheesy grits, biscuit and two pancakes. Everything was good; however, the hash browns, grits and pancakes were especially noteworthy. The coffee was also delicious and topped off regularly. The only knock against them was that the food took about 10 minutes to arrive which is a bit excessive I think. Still, the quality of the food made it worth it.  It's always a nice touch when the owner makes the rounds and greets you personally as a customer. As such, Kenny made us feel appreciated and welcome. As I told him, all he has to do is to keep doing what he's doing and they will be a hit. This place is a Gotta Try.",

The place was hoppin' at 9 am on a Sunday, and we got the last two seats at the bar... which was awesome because we got to see all the food being made! It was like a well-oiled machine watching the kitchen staff and wait staff, who genuinely seemed to enjoy what they were doing.  The fella and I both got boring breakfasts (eggs, meat, potatoes, bread), but they had plenty to choose from to not be boring. I was tempted by some of the sweeter offerings, but I was trying to stay relatively healthy. Ha! Our waitress was super nice, engaging, and right on point with timing. The food came out fast and had generous portions and only cost $19 (including a small OJ). I also appreciated that we were able to pay right at our seat with an iPad - no standing in line or waiting for someone to bring your card back.  By the time we left around 10 am, there was a line around the block, so get there early or be prepared to wait - it's worth it.",

We walked in around 1245 and were told there would be a wait. The place wasn't packed, but there were tables that need cleaning I guess. When we say we were greeted by a lovely waitress.  I ordered the meatloaf plate and a pancake on the side. The food seemed carefully measured out to me. Portions weren't large at all for the price in my opinion, but it was good nonetheless.  My wife ordered the croissant French toast and said it was excellent.  My only criticism would be, that after the waitress asked if we needed coffee refills while we had almost full cups. She never asked us again. I even put my now empty cup at the edge of the table and nothing. But oh well.  Would we return? I believe so. The food was good and the location is central to were we do a lot of business.",

    "text": "Awesome diner with an awesome retro modern decor! I stepped in and felt like 1955 and 2018 had a baby. The staff from the 2 groovy hostesses to my awesome server were....you guessed it....Awesome! Lol. I came to eat with my 2 year old son. I had the chicken and waffles and got the half waffle with sausage links and a fruit bowl for my little dinosaur.  This place is the epitome of a diner, one I would expect to see featured on food network. However, I took away one star because when my chicken and waffles came, I noted that the leg and thigh portion were from a different batch than the breast and wing. The leg and thigh portion were actually cold and the wing was piping hot. I was immediately turned off. Why serve chicken which has been sitting there for lord knows how long with freshly fried chicken? I guess they thought I wouldn't notice.   I will definitely return and try one of the many original dishes. I won't let this one episode ruin this awesome diner for me.",

Plus to know that they tries to keep thing local and make everything from scratch is amazing and get 5 stars in my book.  Like I said. I had the meatloaf and loved it. Well seasoned, not too salty and definitely my type of comfort food. I also ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle have a nice outer crust. Not to soft in the middle. And the chicken is great. Ms. B took good care of me. And she seem to know I'm the type that would enjoy a mimosa. Yes. who can say no to a mimosa. All staffs are friendly and accommodating. Service was quick. Didn't have to wait too long even though they cab get busy. All in all this will be my go to diner.",

    "text": "Wow... Heck of a experience here... Also an easy 5 star review.   We arrived here around 10:30am on a Saturday morning and the place was full. After giving our names we were about 3rd in line to be seated. There's a large beverage bar available and we made cups of coffee and hung out for about 5-10 minutes while waiting for our table.   In no time at all we were seated and immediately our server stopped by and told us about the specials available that day. I looked at my menu and knew right away I was going to have a difficult time selecting my entree. Why so difficult? Well because there was a ton of delicious items to choose from. My friends were having the same problem.   After a few minutes our server stopped by and asked if we were ready to order, we weren't. No problem, she offered to freshen our drinks, bring water, etc. and left us to decide what we were going to order.   Eventually we were all ready to proceed and got our orders in and I took a moment to look around. The kitchen was behind where I was sitting so I had to turn around and look. It was an open air affair and they have a counter with stools available as well. If I had been by myself that's definitely where I would have been sitting. I will say from what I could see that the staff that was working in the kitchen knew what they were doing. They were hustling and running like a finely oiled machine. Also they were doing it quietly. No loud yelling or drama leaking into the dining room.   After about 15 maybe 20 minutes our food arrived (again the place was full) and it looked awesome. I had a dish called the 'Breakfast Pie' which was loaded with eggs, cheese, mushrooms, onions, peppers and red skinned potatoes. I added bacon, and you can also add sausage or ham if you prefer. For the side I ordered home fries. This dish was incredible and I almost didn't finish it due to the huge portion.   My friend Jessie ordered the dish called 'Yo Hala on the Square'. It comes with two slices of challah bread stuffed with a mixture of bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese and hazelnut syrup, prepared like French toast. This is then topped with with a blueberry strawberry compote and powdered sugar. It was a beast! Her husband Dave had the 'Blueberry Crepes' special. I'm not sure what was inside the crepes but they were also smothered with the same blueberry strawberry compote.   All of these entrees were simply fantastic and photo's are enclosed. Service was also outstanding! This was definitely my favorite dining out experience on this trip to Charlotte. I see they have 2 locations up in Richmond Va so maybe I'll get lucky and they'll open a location in Hampton Roads in the future.",

The wait was minimal as we sat at the counter. I love the diversity of customers that were eating at the diner. The place also suited large parties or single persons that could easily sit at the counter. Outside there are plenty of seats for people that would like to wait for the food. Staff were very efficient and fully staffed with a quick turnover of tables to reduce wait time. The cooks were focused and looked busy, I wish I could of tipped them also! Will be coming back very soon",

Overall the meal was much better than my original post so I have given them 4 stars.   Total bill (water) with tip was 14.35. Reasonable for a fresh tasty turkey breast  dinner.",

Eggs bacon grits (delicious grits) and more ... waffles stuffed with yummy fillings and other daily specials .   I finally tried the dinner side last night - I had the turkey dinner and the hubs had the pot roast! Both were delicious! The turkey was flavorful and moist served with mashed potatoes and gravy (on the side) and veggies grilled just right!  It was delicious! Hubs had the pot roast and it was tender and flavorful! Not too salty!!! The veggies were perfect and the the only complaint was who ate the last bite !  Metro Dinner is a Winner!  It really is where the locals eat !",

    "text": "It was nice to discover this new breakfast place on Yelp.  It's a little further for us to drive than we normally would, but traffic isn't bad on a Sunday morning.    The diner is in a strip mall in Pineville (down the street from the mall) and doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you get inside, it's decorated very homey.  You wouldn't know you're in a strip mall.  The decor reminds me of the Corner Bakery Cafes I've been to in Chicago.    We were seated right away (I guess we got there just before the brunch crowds) and the hostess informed us we could help ourselves to the Beverage Bar.  At first, I thought it was strange for us to serve ourselves, but then I realized it was kind of cool.  There are a variety of coffees - regular, decaf, and flavor of the day.  Then there are water, iced teas, and a soda fountain.  They're all one price, so I guess you could potentially mix and match throughout your meal if you wanted.  I tried the French Vanilla coffee and enjoyed it.  Note: our server did refill our coffees for us, so it wasn't completely self-serve.    The menu had a lot of great options (which I LOVE in a breakfast place).  I went with the San Francisco Benedict, which is an eggs benedict with Canadian bacon, sliced avocado, and tomato.  It was everything I wanted out of a benedict; the Hollandaise sauce was creamy and tasty, too.  The benedict came with a side of hashbrowns (although you could substitute).  The hashbrowns were great, too, -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.    There were many other dishes to try in the future.  They have a variety of omelets, breakfast sandwiches, other benedicts, pancakes, French toast, and other misc egg dishes.  There are also lunch and dinner options, including a variety of salads.    For a diner, we had a great experience, and I'm happy to add Metro Diner into our breakfast rotation.",

Large bits of tomatoes and veggies. Entrees Charleston Shrimp n Grits.  Very good.  Had grit cakes.  Creamy sauce.  Thick.  Shrimp very good. Filling. Fried Chicken dinner. Very fresh and hot.  Side salad.   Kept drinks flowing. Good experience.",

Service was pretty slow for a diner breakfast - 30 minutes to get my food from the time I entered.    I had the fruity waffle (Belgian waffle with strawberries/blueberries/bananas) with bacon.  The food was very good.  There was a $2.89 upcharge for the bacon, which the waitress did not mention when she said \"Do you want bacon or sausage with that?\", so be warned.  Another long wait to pay - another server finally took my card.  There were folks waiting for a table by the time I left.  P.S. Don't bother looking for the Yo Hala or Pittsburgh Steak Salad dishes that Guy Fieri raved about on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives - this location doesn't sell them.  Weird, considering the website still features his clips.",

You get half a chicken so there is plenty to go around. The best part is the strawberry butter that they have, it makes the waffle ten times better. The chicken is crunchy and flavorful and the waffle is very light. I've had other dishes here, but none have come close to the chicken waffles.",

    "text": "We have had a couple of meals here, one takeout meal here, and have been here when its busy and when its quieter. My first experience was the takeout. Very nicely packaged, a little smaller portions than eating in, but overall good food. My second experience I had was not so great  with a waitress who had her hands on her nose and mouth , trying to stop a Nasal drip or something. She didn't wash them before she took the menus from another table, and handed kids some drink cups......that was a turn off for me. I said something and it was rectified with a new waitress. But the gross one did tell all of the other ladies, so they were all gawking my way. Why not gawk at her for being gross in front of others. Heck, everything she touched they probably touched after.....Gross! After that issue, on my third visit I was given a free meal (didnt happen on the day of our issue) this time our server was amazing. She did tell us though that she had been told who i was.....i didn't do anything wrong.....yet i was still being pointed out.  4th visit was today. My husband had never been, so it was a treat day. They were super busy. People everywhere. Our wait time was longer. Not horrible but a little wait. I noticed a similar theme though, and its sad, because it was already brought up, and although we love the food and have mostly been treated well, there is a hygiene issue here. Today, a waitress with braids had her hands all over her mouth and rubbing her nose. An older brunettee with a short bob was messing with her face too. They were in front of my table, near the pick up station, grabbing their customers food. Several times, back and forth, and same issue. Miss tall blonde braids, there is a very nice bathroom there, and you can use a tissue and then wash your hands. But no, you stood behind becky and rubbed your face several times while waiting for plates of food  for your customers. Face wipe, grab plates of food, serve it and all over again. I was front and center for the show Between you and the brunette. Touching others plates after touching your faces???? What the hell? And the older blonde who was seating people, she was doing it too. So the waitresses and seating staff at metro, listen up..... If you would be horrified to watch me wipe SNOT off my face, then grab a plate of food for you and give it to you with my unwashed snot hands, i would tell you that's what its like, and then we pay you for it! KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACES LADIES. Period. You have a bathroom, with soap and water. Use it. Go in the bathroom and be discreet. People are watching you touch their plates, and menus and payment kindles.  And if any manager is reading this, check for yourself, those ladies i described were working today. I think they need a hygeine class before someone doesn't write you a note, they just call the health department. HANDS OFF YOUR FACES!!!  That's a pretty basic request, right?",

Any fears of not being as good as the original fly out the door when the sounds and smells of the Metro fill your senses.  Service was friendly and lively, they hired and trained well here.  The food, ah!  The food!  From perfectly poached eggs with bright hollandaise sauce set atop a Belgian waffle and fried chicken to the Monte Cristo sandwich to the cinnamon swirl pancakes, your biggest struggle will be what to order your first time in.  The next time you come, your problem will be do you order what you had last time because it was the best whatever you ever had or do you branch out and try something new.  The secret?  Go with others so you can try it all!  Yes, I'm a big fan of Metro and the new place did not disappoint.  Can't wait to try the other two here in Charlotte.",

After looking over the menu, everyone in my party was having second thoughts, but we decided to give it a chance.  Our waitress was friendly and brought our drinks. As soon as the food hit the table I knew we were not going to be very happy. Fish and chips are very salty and clearly frozen food. Corned beef hash was very poor quality.

    "text": "I hate to write this review, but what a disappointment.  I have been to the original Metro Diner in Jacksonville and this doesn't even come close.  I have just spent 1.5 hours there and an hour of it was waiting... 20 min to be seated, no problem, but 40 min for food??? It was so frustrating and the food was just average.  I like Peter (elite), I ordered the corned beef Hash with poached eggs and was not impressed, not to mention it wasn't even hot.  My husband got the nutty waffle and was ok with it.  The service was good and friendly; she did apologize for the wait but offered no explanation of the hold up.  I am not inclined to return as I can get similar quality within 30 min.",

    "text": "New place. Great concept, cute place. Little bit more upscale that typical diner. Our server was Liz and she was personable and knowledgable. Coffee better than most places. I was able to get half order of my breakfast and able to swap out my regular grits for cheese grits. Frank got eggs and hash browns ordered crispy and bacon. Hash browns came out a little too browned. They were quick to get replacement, brought out by one of the partners, Kenny.. They forgot the toast, brought out by Kenny again. Our eggs were cooked perfectly but barely warm. My grits were kinda bland, had melted cheddar on top. I felt like everything needed salt, except the biscuits and gravy. They are second best I've had. Overall, service was great, management went above and beyond in picking up our tab. I'd definitely try again when some of the kinks got worked out. Everyone deserves a second chance at redemption and I gotta feeling this place is gonna be off the chain.  Stay tuned!",

Metro diner is fully of delicious menu options that is sure to please a breakfast lover or someone who wants to get a classic sandwich or entree option that only a good diner can serve. The wait time is worth the yummy food. They run specials and have revolving desserts, so make sure to see what is featured on the chalk board. I am sure to return when I am in the area.",
