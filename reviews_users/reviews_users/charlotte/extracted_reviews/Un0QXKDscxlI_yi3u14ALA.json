Two detractors: too much salt and Pepsi. Pepsi is evil and nasty. I had to walk across to the gift store to get a coke.",

Melly Mel and I ordered: 4 Piece Supreme Snack (comes with a biscuit, no drink) 4 Piece Supreme Combo (comes with a biscuit, a side, AND drink)  Well, we got fries with both orders (no one is going to complain about that!), but we asked for honey mustard with one order, and ranch with the other.  We only got honey mustard.  They were nice enough to give me some ranch sauce without charging me extra for it.  Now comes to the chicken - it sucks.  It's dry and flavorless, and to top it off, these pieces are small.....I mean, really small.  Imagine 2 Chicken McNuggets stacked side by side, that's the size of 1 piece @ Bo Jangles'.  And the prices!!  For what we ordered, we paid $15.  Not worth it.    I hope people in the south have Popeye's....b/c Bo Jangles' ain't cuttin' it....he should probably stick to tap dancing b/c chicken ain't his thang....",

As is the custom while sleepwalking, I joined in on the adventure. I became fully conscious a couple of minutes later when the guy with headphones wanted to take my order. My lips spit out the last words my brain recorded from the suited dude before me in line: \"cajun filet biscuit combo\" (pause one second) \"po rounds\" (pause one second) \"pepsi\". What the hell did I just order??  I would give the end results of my sleepwalking adventure a B/B+. The cajun filet biscuit itself was delicious like my favorite junk-food breakfast item (McDonald's Sausage Biscuit), with a chunk of larger better juicier meat but at 4x the price. I would skip the po rounds the next time. Also, they charged me extra for the soda... shame on them, taking advantage of the sleepy. I'll give it another try the next time I see a Bojangles without the airport-food price tag.",

Wanting to pass by some of the franchise places, I checked Bojangles out in the Concourse B side of the airport. (I realize now that Bojangles is a franchise, but it doesn't slow me down from checking out the place.)  There's a simple counter with the menu items above on the wall. On the right is a shared eating area with other restaurants, and you can see the planes go by too.  I ordered a two piece dinner, which came with a biscuit, leg and thigh, and Dirty Rice as my side. The biscuit was fresh and buttery, and the dirty rice was good, with chunks of meat in it. The chicken however was ok; it wasn't as dry as some Kentucky Fried Chicken orders I've had in the past. It was really greasy though, and not as controlled as Popeye's.  For what it's worth, it's a fine additional choice to all the food places in the airport. if you're looking for a snack or so, then this is the place for you.",

Because I could do worse at an airport.     ---   ---   ---  Like any insanely obsessed foodie, I used my $8 in-flight WiFi to look up the Charlotte airport's food options so I could have at least an hour to decide on what I was going to eat for lunch. I was going to go with the Mongolian Grill until I noticed Bojangles. I have a friend from North Carolina that has pimped Bojangles for years, so my choice was pretty obvious.  I took about 617 people movers from my terminal to BoJ's, and my conclusion is this: while it's really good, I wish it could be slightly more about quality than fast foodish. The idea of warm biscuits and fried chicken is so obvious, it made me wonder why more places are not based around this heavenly combination of comfort food.   It was delicious, but the lack of a 5th star is due to just a bit much on the layers of fried breading before reaching the chicken.  You take those biscuits with Publix or PDQ fried chicken? My God... I'd be flying to Charlotte just for a stop at BoJangles.",

Take in mind this review is based solely on my breakfast purchase of the tastiest chicken biscuit I have had to date.  The chicken is cajun and seasoned perfectly, not too spicy, perfect amount of heat.  Chicken breast was very juicy, not dry at all.  The biscuit was soft, fluffy and also had a great buttery flavor as well.  Hand in hand the cajun chicken paired perfectly with the biscuit, which I might add was hearty in size as well.    I would SO opt for their cajun chicken biscuit over the spicy chicken biscuit from Chick-Fil-A because sometimes theirs is a hit and miss with the size of meat and heat level.  Whenever I get back to these parts, I am going to look for a Bojangles and tear up another biscuit, lol.  The fried chicken looks fantastic so I know I want to try that also.  Lucky all of you that have one of these nearby; can you airmail me one, lol",

I work in customer service and speak with the public every single day. I KNOW there are nicer and much friendlier ways to go about correcting someone. Also.... context clues.

I then promptly walked over to Starbucks and had a friendly exchange with a barista and walked away with a turkey pesto sandwich. Thank you Starbucks for having customer service.

Bojangles is always a \"must stop\" for me whenever I'm in the Carolinas, so I was more than happy to get my fill of chicken, biscuits, and seasoned fries. I just wish that they had the half gallon of sweet tea that I could have taken with me :/",

We got the supreme (spicy) chicken tender combo with the seasoned fries, and also a biscuit and sweet tea! The fries were soooo good. They were nice and hot when we got them too! I was slightly disappointed in the biscuit cuz it wasn't as buttery as I expected... But oh well lol. The chicken tenders were good, but not as spicy as I was wanting - the amount of crunch and moisture they had made up for it though. The employees at this locations were extremely nice, which is rare in an airport. I'm sad we don't have this place in Washington.",

The Supremes are the spicy cousin of their regular chicken tenders.  After eating 2/4 chicken tenders, 1/3 of the biscuit and 1/2 the bag of deliciously seasoned fries I was done.  I decided that it was just not worth the calories to finish my entire meal. This is partially because I am fatter than ever, and partially because it just wasn't that spectacular.  It wasn't bad, just wasn't blow all your calories on it good.   The real star of the meal was my side of perfectly seasoned delicious fries. Next best was the biscuit. Terminal B doesn't seem to have too many dining options.  I would probably get Bo Jangles again on another layover but if they happen to open up a Panda Express or something similar in this terminal, that's where you'll find me.",

This time i got the Chicken strips with French Fries. It was as always so good! The line is long, because,it is so good. But, they are very quick and you get your food fast. The price is not that bad, and it is in the airport which is high to begin with. But, I think Bojangles price is not that bad. It is good and it is nice and hot.

The sandwich had the right amount of spice and the chicken was extremely moist and the portions were great. The filet was really meaty and juicy. The chicken leg was also moist and flavorful.

Disappointed that this is what a lot of out of towners will think of when they hear Bojangles. Overpriced cold and dry Cajun filet biscuits and even colder fries. Served to you by people that look as though they hate their job even more than that gate agent at B5 having to rebook an entire plane worth of passengers after a cancelation. And I paid how much for this?! I should've  just got a cheese plate from Beaudevin.   Do yourself a favor...get outta the airport and go 5 minutes down Wilkinson to the Bojangles there and be greeted by smiling friendly folks serving up piping hot CF biscuits and botato rounds/Cajun fries ( however you're feeling). They will also supply you with a honey mustard if you wish ( and you should). And don't forge the sweet tea( I like mine half and half). Mmmm. I digress...",

Then I take a bite of the chicken. It's steaming hot and the skin is crispy, but after the second or third bite I start to gulp the iced tea. The chicken is super salty. And I still had 2.5 pieces to get through...I'm not wasting it! To help make it more edible I grabbed done hot sauce and dunked the chicken in.  After all the effort, I was full, but not satisfied. I think I should've just stuck to the open-faced European-style sandwiches at Beadeuvin in the Central Terminal. That's a classy, healthy spot in this airport.

    "text": "I recently traveled through Charlotte and although I don't normally eat fried food, I decided to try this place out because I had heard of it before and never tried it. I got a chicken tender plate with cajun fries and it came with a biscuit.   The Food  The chicken was ok, it wasn't stellar, and I thought the fried coating was overdone. I could not taste the chicken, only the batter which tasted good, but it was overpowering. The fries were ok, they are not my favorite type, but the seasoning wasn't overpowering and I could taste potato which was good. The biscuit was soggy and burnt around the sides. I did not enjoy it much, but I could tell that the flavor was good, and maybe if I went to another place, I would like it better. They also have a selection of pepsi products to drink as soda. I opted for a Mountain Dew, since I needed to stay awake. It was a bit costly to eat, at 9 dollars, so I wasn't impressed with this place at all.  The Service and Decor  The decor is typical airport. It's cramped, crowded, there is seating nearby that is usually filled during the rush, so its hard to find a spot. Typical airport problems. The customer service was ok. Nothing special. The woman who took my order was sitting on a countertop and sounded like she was on painkillers, so she may have had an injury or something like that. I'm not sure what was going on, but it was definitely different from what I have experienced in the past. She was polite at any rate and sped people through quickly.   Overall, I think my experience here was pretty bad, and I probably wouldn't go to Bojangle's at the airport again. I will however try it out again because I have a feeling that the restaurants outside of the airport will probably be a better experience.",

The chicken was high quality and the batter was crispy but kinda bland. It's not seasoned at all, I would say. The biscuit is really soft but just tasted old. The fries were good and well seasoned with Cajun. I just I had tried the half gallon of sweet tea. Completely forgot to try that!! I also would like to give another locaton of this chain a chance. Maybe the one at the airport didn't do it justice.",

The chicken was perfect: crispy, juicy, moist, not too salty, and fast! Grab a sweet tea and you're good to go.  Of course when I saw the Bojangles in the airport, I knew exactly what my next meal would be. Within seconds of ordering (literally), I had my box in hand, ready to hop on my connecting flight. Once on board, I feasted like none other and it was exactly how I remembered. Nothing could take me away from my moments of ecstasy. Not the crying baby three rows back. Not the grouchy grandmother to my left that didn't her ginger ale. Not the extreme turbulence as we ascended into the sky.  If you're having a bad travel day (or even a good one), indulge and treat yourself to a chicken dinner that'll make your journey that much better.",

It has all your favorite items (or items that you tolerate when you have to eat at a Bojangles) and serves it up pretty quickly.  The airport price-gouging mark up that you would find at any eatery in an airport is here, but given the Bo's normally low prices, it won't hit you to hard in the wallet.   Biggest issue? Limited table seating. If the airport is even remotely busy, be prepared to have to carry it to your gate and balance your Styrofoam container precariously upon your thighs while you try eat in the shitty faux-leather chairs.",

    "text": "Knowing that I had a layover in Charlotte, NC, and knowing that there was a Bojangles in the airport I just had to look up the location (end of Terminal B) so that I could run over during my short layover. I waited in a speedy line, but when I got to the front I realized it was fast because the cashier was very short with me, bordering on rude, and not helpful. I ordered a Cajon Filet Biscuit, fries, sweet tea, and a bo-berry biscuit. I was quickly shuffled down the line to wait for my food. A number similar to mine was immediately called, and someone else at the front of the line immediately grabbed it and walked away. I waited wondering when my food would be ready; at this point, I thought it was a normal wait because numbers before mine were still being called. Five minutes later, the gentleman that took the order before me came back to the counter stating that what he received/took was not his order. I then come to find out that it was MY order. A supervisor was nearby, and offered to make me a new sandwich. No one offered me a new sweet tea or bo-berry biscuit. I asked the server for a new sweet tea, and he obliged me. The supervisor returned with my sandwich and forgot the fries, but then quickly remembered and added them.  No one offered me a new bo-berry biscuit. I don't understand why the supervisor didn't offer to replace everything, considering a random person walked away with my food and was in possession of it for roughly five minutes. I don't understand why I had to specifically ask for a new sweet tea. I didn't ask for a few bo-berry biscuit, and it was never offered to me. That's just ridiculous, who thinks it ok to essentially get \"used\" food. They didn't even open the box to check that it wasn't obviously contaminated.  I didn't bother arguing with the service members because clearly they don't value customer service or cleanliness. To round out this horrible experience, after hustling to my flight in Terminal D, I sit down to find that the new sandwich I was given was a Cajun Filet Sandwich, which was almost flavorless with not a single hint of cajun flavor, and not a Cajon Filet Biscuit. I didn't come all this way for a bun. I came for the biscuit. The service and food at Bojangles really disappointed me. I will not recommend any Bojangles branch to anyone until my concerns are addressed.   And to top it off, the contact feature on there website limits you to ~500 characters so that I wasn't able to submit a moderately detailed description of what happened.",

I was tempted to get their breakfast biscuits (breakfast served all day) but steered clear when I saw the calorie content was almost my entire day's worth of calories. I opted for the \"healthier\" option of lettuce, tomato, carrots, cheese and freshly fried chicken. The wait was longer for the salad than all the breakfast sandwiches because of the chicken. It was worth the wait because it was delicious. I got the honey mustard dressing. The chicken was hot, fresh, crispy, nicely seasoned and mighty yummy. This spot is in terminal b. The salad was super filling and good enough for one big appetite or two smaller ones. There's a large eating area to the right of the shop. The cashier woman was friendly and joked around with me.",

No s#%+ there I was stumbling through Charlotte international airport when I noticed a bright yellow sign as a distant blur...  no wayyy!!! BoJANGLES.  I quickly picked up the pace as my flight was boarding in 5 minutes.   The menu was just as a remembered it. I could see the golden brown biscuits through the glass and the chicken strips in their glorious nakedness. I ordered the 4 piece tenders and cajun fries with a side biscuit and a classic Bojangles sweet tea.   Living on the westcoast now I haven't eaten at a Bojangles in over 10 years. I wanted to order so much more, but I knew that carrying a giant bag filled with succulent chicken COULD cause another viral airplane video. So I kept it simple. I grubbed on the walking path and enjoyed that blistful moment of deliciousness. If you are anywhere near B gates....just do it. Make your way to Bojangles amd treat yourself.",

I saw a bright yellow sign that said \"Bojangle's chicken\".  There's no Bojangle's in California (or not to my knowledge) so I ordered a 4-piece snack chicken tenders with a small season fries.  The snack came with their famous biscuits.  The chicken was tender inside, crispy outside but a bit salty.  For airport food, I really couldn't complain abut the taste or the price.  Thumbs up for me, and as Michelle P said, if the airport food was pretty tasty, I can only imagine what an actual location would be.",

Bojangles locations were in no short supply, and I was always excited when people-who-had-cars would suggest a trip. We alternated between Bojangles, TB and Cookout. (Oh how I miss you, my Cookout!)  When we missed our Charlotte connection, before even leaving the plane, I turned to my friend and said I hoped they had an airport Bojangles. It was 8 a.m. at the time, but oh well. I had been up since 2:30 a.m. so it was basically lunchtime.  Sure enough, we got off the plane, looked at the terminal map and eventually made our way over (after getting beers, of course). I was so thrilled to be in the presence of Bojangles again that I asked my friend to take a photo of me with their sign. I assume all of the staff members thought I was a total nutjob, but it's okay!  Opening my chicken sandwich and seasoned fries took me right back to the 2000s. Thank you, airport Bojangles, for the wonderful nostalgic meal. Love, love, love.",

This one is located by gate B9 and there is a small seating area nearby. Do your fellow passengers a big favor and PLEASE DO NOT BRING FRIED CHICKEN ON THE PLANE. Sure, it tastes great for you, but the smell carries for miles and miles. So yes, get some of this great stuff. And then eat it in the airport!  Okay, enough ranting. I got a simple platter with a breast and a wing plus mashed potatoes and cole slaw. I'm not going to have their mac & cheese in the airport, but at the retail outlets, it's okay. The chicken was quite moist but there was a lot of batter. The fixin's were okay. Nothing special  I can't say that I'm blown away by Bojangles, but it's one of those things that I generally have about once a year.  For a laugh, pronounce it \"Bo-HANG-glaze\".",

They were out of dark meat, so I waited about 12 minutes for them to make a new batch because I don't believe in white meat fried chicken =). It was defintely worth the wait! Fresh out of the fryer, the skin was perfectly crispy, and the chicken was nice and moist. The mashed potatoes and biscuits were pretty standard for a fast food friend chicken place, but definitely still satisfying. I'm glad I walked to the next terminal over to eat here!",

I ordered the \"Cajun\" filet Club combo. I was skeptical because as you all know New Orleans is the go to place for Cajun or Creole food. Restaurants in other states state that it is Cajun or Creole food and it tastes like food out of the MRE pouches. I was not disappointed; the temperature was where it needed to be and the level of spice did exactly what I needed it to do. I ordered the combo which I choose to order the dirty rice and a drink. The \"red cherry drink\" (yes, that is the name) has a major kick as soon as you take the first and second sip but afterwards it is not that strong. It kind of tastes like Popeye's dirty rice but it does not have that straight out of the box after taste like Popeye's and Church's. Overall, I do not have any complaints about this place; surprisingly it is located in the airport.",

The Cajun season had a nice flavor to it and the crispy chicken amplified that awesome taste, the biscuit added to that savory meal and I enjoyed every bite of it!

This particular location had quick, friendly service, but they could use a little work on the smiling.   On one trip I had the Cajun Filet Biscuit and was grateful I had caught them before closing. On the return trip through I ordered a 3 piece dinner with mashed potatoes and gravy, it also came with a biscuit, and was delicious. I'd never had the mashed potatoes there, and while they seem to be of the instant kind, they're tastier than KFC or Popeye's in my opinion.  Service is consistent. Food is consistent and served hot and fresh. If you can't decide, the Cajun Filet Biscuit is the best go to!",

So I will preface this rating by saying I understand that any airport iteration of a restaurant is going to be lacking the charm and quality of their non-airport versions.  Bottom line - for airport food it was good. I'd much prefer this fried chicken over anything else in the airport. The biscuit was good too. But if I'm comparing, this was no better than the similarly Cajun influenced Popeye's chain. I'd say this is more of a guilty pleasure because it was greasier and tasted more unhealthy than usual. That's a good thing in my book if we're judging fried chicken. While Bojangles didn't jangle my whole existence, I'd come back to it like I'd come back to any Popeye's.   Service was super nice and fast which is appreciated for weary travelers.",

It came out really quickly and i also grabbed several bags of hot sauce to go. The chicken rice bowl is so good!! It comes with a large portion of chicken, dirty rice, beans and cheese on top. Its pretty salty though, so you might get bloated if you eat this before you fly. The sweet potato pie had a nice flaky cinnamon crust and a decent amount of filling.  Great way to try a Charlotte chain if youre bored of the other airport food.",

Getting food late is never fun, but it's even worse when half of the food has been sitting on the counter for those 20 minutes. By the time we got the food, half of it was cold and soggy and the other half was too hot to eat. The photo shows the moment we got our food compared to the time we ordered.  We will probably not eat at a Bojangles again.",

I opted for the chicken tenders, or \"supremes\" as Bojangles named them, along with a biscuit.  The chicken was excellent.  The breading was crispier than I'd imagined, and gave it a nice crunch.  The chicken was juicy.  The biscuit was good, but definitely not the best ever (that spot is reserved for Popeye's).  Bojangles is definitely a worthy stop for a meal or even a snack if you find yourself at the Charlotte airport with an appetite and little bit of time.",

Having spent a great deal of time around the gulf coast and across Louisiana I'd like to think I have a certain appreciation for this type of food, but I experienced little of the characteristic flavor the cuisine is known for. Judged on the merits of Airport fast food, it is a worthwhile option, but apart from the excellent biscuits and heavily peppered fries, I world put it somewhere behind Popeyes in the world of fast food chicken. The main issue I had is the chicken isn't spicy at all, which puts it an incredible disadvantage to better seasoned alternatives.",

This little airport location does the chain justice (food wise) by offering a good selection of the menu at pretty comparable prices. I got in line yesterday last night with a purpose and that purpose was a 2 breast combo with a side of macaroni and cheese. Was the staff friendly? Not really, in fact they had practically no personality at all, which I might care about if I wasn't so distracted by the smell of the delicious chicken. The food itself was amazing, because it's southern fried chicken done right. Both pieces were juicy, tender, and oh so flavourful. The macaroni and cheese was also good even though I was way too full to enjoy them when I tried.  Overall, I love me so Bojangles. The food is great, the staff was not, but I care way more about fried chicken then people.",

When ordering, I had said that I wanted the 4 pc supreme COMBO and 2 sausage biscuits. I ordered the combo to take back to CA for a friend to try while I have the drink with the sausage biscuits. While waiting, I had walked back over to Marta to ask why I don't get a drink with the 4 pc combo. She replied, \"It doesn't come with a drink.\" I checked my receipt and realized she had rung me up for the snack instead of the combo. I said to her I had wanted the combo, she responds with, \"No. You wanted the snack, you remember saying that?\" It was too early to go through the trouble of changing my orders so I just said, \"Fine\" and walked back over to the \"pick up\" area. That same time, the person that was handing out food, walked over to Marta and did a \"mmmm hmmmm.\" When my food was ready, she handed me my food and I asked if they had a bag for it (taking the combo home, didn't wanna stink the plane up). She bagged the snack box and threw it on the counter. I know she was giving me attitude for asking Marta about the whole drink thing and she clearly wanted to make it very obvious too.   I get that employees in the airport hate having to deal with customers that are getting delayed, missing their flights, whatever. Doesn't matter who you are, if you hate your job to where you can't stand dealing with customers, find something else. For you to still be there even with all your reasons for hating the place, you're just not pushing yourself enough.   Also, while waiting, I think one of the cooker in the back found a bug or mouse because they yelled out kinda loud and ran to the back.",

I had a 2 hour layover in Charlotte and was blessed to find the infamous Bojangles' steps away from my gate. There ain't no good fried chicken up north so I figured it was as good of a time as any to try Bojangles' for the first time. It lived up to its name.   I got the 2 piece leg and thigh meal with fries and a biscuit. The thigh was so huge, I thought they accidentally gave me a breast at first. The chicken was hot, juicy and tender. I'm all about that dark meat. The skin was nice and crispy as well. Good cajun seasoning on that fried chicken. The biscuit was fluffy but I thought mine tasted a little salty. The side of fries was pretty standard. I also tried the cajun filet sandwich. After my initial bite, I thought they had given my a chicken sandwich by mistake. Turns out - they use that same fried chicken batter for the fish. Pretty cool. I've heard of chicken fried steak...but not chicken fried fish. It also had the cajun seasoning in it.

I just wanted something small so went for their Cajun Filet Biscuit $4.59 (sandwich only). The chicken and biscuit was good but nothing to rave about. I say I'll pick Popeyes chicken or Chick fila (which they have available at the airport not too far from here) over this place. Prices are very reasonable especially for airport food.

Located in concourse B (that was recently hunger-games-esq) The airport remodel is coming along, but the Bojangles (along with the other food places have been in operation through construction).  This location shares a dining space with the bagel place next door, but since everything on the menu is mostly \"eat with your hands\", it is easy enough to take with you and devour at the airport gate or on the airplane.  There has been an occasion when this particular location starts running out of food.  I do remember one time they were out of fries and there was a long long wait.  They started substituting things/other sides for people that just wanted something and had to catch their flight, but generally I think this is a very rare occasion.  I would imagine that their storage (at the airport) is limited so just keep that in mind - hopefully they have a good sense of what's running out and will tell you before you order.  Other than the unique airport challenges, it is a typical Bojs location.  I love you can get breakfast all day.  Probably makes sense at an airport where people's body clocks are on all based in different time zones.",

    "text": "Hungry as I was heading back home from Fort Bragg, I saw Bojangles in Terminal B and thought, \"Hmmm, a chicken biscuit sandwich would taste good right about now.\" In short, it wasn't. The biscuit was tasteless, really dry, and extremely crumbly. As if it was left in the oven too long. I was offered no sauce and didn't see any honey around as condiments. The chicken was nothing to write home about due to lack of seasoning. To top it off, the person behind the counter had her left hand on her cheek while resting her elbow on the register the whole time me and fellow customers ordered. She seemed upset that she had to take peoples' orders.  I'll give them another try at one of their locations someday. I just know it won't be this one.",

Honestly it did t taste any different than Popeyes. The Mac n cheese was OK at best, chicken was ehhhhh average and the biscuit was pretty delicious. Might even say it's better than Popeyes. Cleanliness at the airport location would have failed in some areas. They don't clean any of the tables, there's water on the floor, trash on the floor... but I coughed that up to being a busy time at the airport so traffic was pretty heavy earlier this afternoon. But if someone asked me if I'd go there again, my answer would be NO. Not even to an actual restaurant.",

    "text": "It's not the most incredible Bojangles I've ever had, but it works great in a pinch and especially when considering the other airport food options. Yes, the lines can be annoying here, service can be a bit forgetful with one's order, and the prices are naturally higher by virtue of being in CLT. Sometimes the need for fried chicken will best all of these issues and considering there is no Bojangles where I call home, this is sometimes the best compromise I can make.  The premise is simple. Wait in line, figure out the simplified menu, and order, as quickly as possible. If it's past 4pm, be prepared to be told certain items are no longer available. Take advantage of when there is no line and know that seating is going to be limited but at least the turnover is quick.  Also know the average dinner combination will run one about $10. Know your drink ahead of time and if you're down with the fatness, Bo-size the combo for an additional 79 cents. Don't bother with the mediocre Cajun Pintos (beans), Cole Slaw as side options. Consider the Dirty Rice or Mash when in doubt, but the seasoned fries will always be in their own category.  When I'm feeling lazy, I'm rocking a Chicken Rice Bowl ($8), which is very KFC-esque and if I'm feeling nostalgic, I'll shoot for the 4 piece tenders ($9). Breakfast is served at all times, which is nice. The biscuits are awesome on their best days, but bricks on their worst.  Beware, the salads are not worthy. It's either not enough meat and greens or too much meat and not enough greens. I can't speak highly of the sandwiches either but they're solid for people who enjoy a good bun. I prefer to slice the biscuits in half and stick a piece of chicken in there somewhere and slater in some of their infamous hot sauce. It's really food coma inducing, especially prior to a flight.  Lastly this is all the way in Terminal B (B9, to be specific). If you're lucky, the flight might just land in the same corner. If not, you'll have to trot past the main food court in the middle of the airport and head over to this spot. Do not come here in a hurry. There is a chance it'll be awhile before your food is actually ready.",

It is a bit pricey for fast food standards but maybe that was because I ordered a dinner plate and a side of mac and cheese along with an ice tea.  I can assure you portions are large.  I definitely enjoyed the macaroni, mashed potatoes, ice tea and the biscuit.  All yummy! I think people will like the chicken but for me the flavor ended after the fried skin.",

While sitting in the USAir club thinking how breakfast options are terrible at this airport, I jumped onto yelp. After reading reviews, I made the trek down at 7am on a Saturday. Pretty good line formed (about 9 deep) but I'd say it only took 4-5 minutes until I had ordered and received my order!    Biscuits were pretty decent. Sausage and gravy biscuit was also good at the time. Cajun chicken I tried too but didn't seem very breakfast like, but was of alright quality for a fast food airport joint.  After about an hour though, I sure felt like crud.  I never have stomach problems from food - but this one sure made me feel somewhat sick on my next two flights.  Will not return.  Not worth it, especially when flying and either way the food is NOT good for you at all.",

Sadly, the timing wasn't right to try it out on the last visit. Thank me now for sparing you the gory details. So color me thrilled when I discovered they served chicken breakfast meals right at the airport.   After ordering, I found a table to the side. There I pieced out my sammich and enjoyed slicing up the chicken fillet to devour and savor bite by bite. It was super tasty, crispy, fresh and moist. Delightful! Then I ketchup'd up my tater rounds...those were gone almost instantly. And finally, finally...spread a couple of packs of honey on the hot, flakey tastylicious bisquit.   Man...my stomach is excited just thinking about it. Breathe. Breathe. Okay, then all washed down with the sweetest of sweet tea!!!

    "text": "This place really hit the spot. I was on a two hour layover, had only about 2-3 hours of sleep under my belt, and needed some comfort food. Bojangles definitely delivered in that aspect.   While the concourse was pretty busy (7:00 AM on a weekday), the line was tolerable and moved relatively quick. I found it to be a pretty efficient operation; a friendly woman took my order in the line and gave me a receipt to eventually use at the register. Despite the relatively light line everyone in the kitchen area seemed to be a bit stressed, the individual at the end of the assembly line kept on forgetting to hand over drinks to customers with combo orders. The adjacent dining area is shared with a bagel shop and felt a bit small considering the relatively high volume of patrons that morning; I was lucky enough to find a table clearing out.   I ordered the Cajun Fillet biscuit combo, which came with a side of bo-tato rounds (hash browns).. and somehow a cinnamon roll got thrown into the mix. The fillet was buttery, spicy and really hit the spot. The potato rounds were bite-sized like Burger King/Hardee's but were about 5x thicker and simply divine. The cinnamon roll was good.. I'd like to someday try the delicious looking bo-berry biscuits on display. This was my first breakfast at Bojangles, and I was impressed.   All in all, for the amount of food and inclusive drink I received, I found the price ($7.50) to be very reasonable for CLT.. The other day I desperately paid $13 for a simple sandwich and bottled water from a Wolfgang Puck kiosk during a short/hectic connection caused from a series of thunderstorms that crippled airport operations.",

The biscuit was fluffy but dry, and the chicken was pretty dry too.  Tasty, but dry.  3) The ice tea was gooood.  So there's that.",

I wasn't feeling all that hot, and though I wasn't hungry, I wanted to try to sleep at my gate, so I thought I would take care of eating to get it out of the way.  Being from CA, I had never heard of Bojangles before, but I thought I would give it a shot, since they 1) had breakfast and 2) were right there when I got off my plane, so it took very little brainpower to decide on what to eat.    I got the egg and cheese biscuit meal, which came with a drink (I got OJ) and \"botato rounds\" which were silver dollar sized hash browns.  I opened up my biscuit and was pleased to see it wasn't some tiny little thing, it was warm and it smelled good.  So I took a bite.  HOLY GUACAMOLE!  It was SO good.  As soon as I took my first bite I was immediately starving and all sense of not feeling well dissipated.  The biscuit was so tasty, I couldn't believe it.  Buttery and salty and everything a good biscuit should be.  The egg and cheese balanced it out perfectly, so it wasn't dry and difficult to swallow.  I scarfed it down and considered getting another one.  I was pleasantly surprised by the little kick of spice on the hash browns.  Nothing out of this world or anything, but more than just a salty taste (they could have been a tad warmer, but still good, nonetheless).    I had another long layover on my way back, and this time it was around lunch time.  I was so tempted by that breakfast sandwich, I almost got another one (since you can get breakfast all day), but wound up trying the 2 piece dinner with a breast and thigh, a biscuit and a side (I got mashed potatoes and gravy).  It's been a long time since I have had a piece of fried chicken, but I can say with confidence that it was way better than I remember KFC being.  The chicken has a kick, too, and while it certainly wasn't over-whelmingly spicy or anything, it did register as more than just some flavoring thrown in there.  The mashed potatoes were just fine, nothing amazing, but very satisfying eaten with my biscuit.  For a fast food joint, it certainly exceeded my expectations!  If I ever pass through Charlotte Douglas International airport again, I'll be eating here!",

I love that the biscuits are big enough to slop up the gravy...maybe they need to use it like a cup for the gravy!    Thank goodness I had the foresight to buy this instead of the tacky snacks they want you to buy on the plane. I made the poor man sitting next to me cry from the smell of chickeny goodness during the flight. One thing I didn't like is that they still have the styrofoam packaging that eats up landfills. Otherwise, a good place to hunker down to get your clucks on.",

The 2 piece combo is so delicious. The leg and thigh are both freakin' juicy and the breaded skin is amazing and crunchy. Actually if you think the thigh is too oily, you can ask for 2 leg pieces.  The biscuit is good, not too buttery (make sure you get the honey packets to dump on it!!) YUM. I tried the dirty rice, pretty good with hot sauce, the beans were not my cup of tea, and I've had better cole slaw, but the cole slaw was refreshing. Fries were well seasoned, and the sweet tea was delicious! Honestly, I just love the chicken here, better than anything I've had before. I even looked on their site to see if they had any locations near Cali, but sadly it's just in the southern and east coast regions.   Anything with the word \"Famous\" in the title, you gotta try at least once! This was definitely worth it. Til next time Bojangles, til next time..",

Bojangles serves up some legit, piping hot, fresh, crispy, fried chicken.  And for breakfast, the tots in the meal are slightly onion ring-flavored and awesome.  I normally don't care much for biscuits, but, damn, the biscuits are buttery, dense, and pretty irresistible!

    "text": "\"JIGGA JIGGA, CALL THAT GIRL BOJANGLES\".... YUM-O CHICKEN!  I was SO excited to see Bojangles in the terminal during my 2-hour stopover from Miami and I'm really glad I tried this place.   Notes:   -The biscuit was humongous.... but it was the most boring biscuit I'd ever eaten. So much so that I actually gave up halfway through eating it and let my brother have it. It wasn't creamy or buttery or flaky enough for me. It was just.... bleh... a biscuit, and I probably could've made better at home.  -Loved the sweet tea, because I'm a fanatic for Southern-style sweet tea.   -The chicken was the real prize. Crunchy like popeye's, tasted like it was marinated in Cajun spices too. We didn't order spicy but there was just this kick in the back of your throat from the chicken that made your mouth say \"Hello\".   -The fries were REALLY salty. I thought side dishes were supposed to help balance out the salty flavor between the main dish (the chicken)? Um no, each bite was like a flavor explosion that I didn't necessarily enjoy all too well: spicy chicken, salty fries, sweet tea, repeat. Oh wait, maybe that's where the bland biscuit comes into play?   Anyhow, the prices are almost reasonable but definitely more expensive than any other fast-food fried chicken joint. The largest family dinner (I think it was an 8-piece with sides) in order to feed a family of 5 cost us $30 and we were still hungry afterwards. So you're telling me it would've cost us $60 to satisfy us?  Would I go back? Yes. Would it be worth it? Probably not.   My advice: Skip the mumbo-jumbo hoopla sides and just order the chicken and a sweet tea. You'll feel much more fulfilled.",

If I lived in Charlotte, I would probably find a way to get into the airport just to go to this location.  More?  I had two stopovers here and both times were excellent at opposite times of day. I have a theory that this location has consistently fresh turnover of food because it is right next to the terminal. People keep coming off their flight hungry, so they gotta keep making fresh food to fill the demand. That's where you come in.  Don't you have a flight to catch?  If you're still reading, here's what I get every time and why. Two piece dinner, dark meat, The chicken is golden brown, and has a crispy, perfect flavor, perfect crispness, and big juicy pieces. Everything about it is just exactly the way I like it. Mashed potatoes are obviously constituted and come with this rich, tasty gravy. For fast food mashed, it is tops.   But by far, the best part of the meal is the huge flaky biscuit, not too buttery, crisp and firm on outside. It must be made (somewhat) from scratch because it's too good.  Service is good, but there is no free water and airport drinks are expensive. You can add a fountain drink for a dollar or so or wait til your flight. Which by the way, shouldn't you be getting on to right now?",

    "text": "It wouldn't be right to have an airport in Charlotte without a Bojangles. And, as long as you cruise midway through the B gates, you'll find this state's best known fast food chain. Does the food inside the confines of the airport rival that dished out in traditional locations? Some days, yes. Others no.   There's a lot of inconsistency here. For example, at 7am this morning, I ordered a Chicken Supremes combo and so did my buddy, less than 30 seconds apart from each other. His was ready in 30 seconds. Mine took 10 minutes. His fries were much better than mine. Meanwhile, if you are a fan of Bojangles you'll be content. For the most part the menu is the same and as expected prices are higher than in a non-airport location.   Meanwhile, where else can you get a Pecan Twist, Bo-Berry Biscuit and sweet tea to take on the plane? If you're in the mood for fast food, you'll be served well here. And, unlike many other vendors in this airport, the line moves quickly.   If you're a Bojangles newbie, try the Cajun Fillet Biscuit in the morning and the Chicken Supremes combo (they are better than the Homestyle Tenders) with fries and a sweet tea later in the day. Ask to upgrade the biscuit to a Pecan Twist. Do so and this will become one of your favorite fast food chains.",

The airport bojangles was great to have available but it was a little far from the main terminal intersections. So it was a little bit of a mission to get to from other gates.  However, the service was fast and quick and despite being in the airport, the prices was still super quick! If I'm ever in the Charlotte airport again, this is the first pit stop for me unless I'm running late for my flight!",

    "text": "Be warned.  This is gateway Bojangles.  It can lead to full-scale Bojangles addiction.  I fly USAIRWAYS rather than Delta to get to this, the first Bojangles I can get to on the way home, anticipating, hoping, to deboard at or depart from gates B9 -12, so as to have enough time to experience Bojanglification (Music, there should be music:  Harps.  And angels.  Angels making that holy \"Ahhhh\" sound).    Nobody's claiming it's health food, but it is the absolute best chain southern fried chicken, and holds its own among any I've tried, at any price, anywhere.  The unhealthiest part, the battered, fatty skin, is of course, the absolute best. uniformly, consistently crispy, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of their proprietary Cajun seasoning, with just a touch of heat (maybe a touch less than there used to be?), and the meat juicy, moist, and flavorful to the bone.  The fresh biscuits, for which I think them equally well-known, while not particularly \"flaky\", are light and fluffy, and generally delicious on their own, the combination perfectly complimented by the (usually) perfectly brewed sweet tea, uncontaminated by unnecessary additions of such as raspberry or peach flavor, and usually just perfectly, and not overly sweet, to the Southern tongue at least (though would not be enough to my SC housemate).    I have tried most, if not all of the breakfast biscuits, and love them as well, but can understand some folk's shock at the saltiness of the ham biscuit, but note it is (correctly) billed as \"country ham\", as opposed to I guess \"city ham\", of the deli meats/sandwich slice variety, softer, and far less briny, but Bojangles' is True to the country ham tradition, so be warned, and keep the BP meds handy.  The Bo-Berry biscuits are an icing covered sugary mess to eat, and absolutely delicious when warm, but one is sufficient, or a tad more than, and should not be consumed by the diabetic except in immediate anticipation of administration of last rites or at least loss of consciousness.  I'm not sure the Bo-Berries are quite worth the sugar overdose, but the chicken is worth every juicy, delectably, deliciously, nose-opening, olfactory and salivary stimulating calorie and milligram of sodium - at least once in a while.        While it's not all been perfect every single time I've been through, it's been so remarkably, consistently excellent at this small, extremely high-traffic outpost on so many separate occasions, that I can't fault them for the one time or two time \"off-tasting\" teas or not quite up to their usual near-beatific peak on every occasion, and the prices aren't bad for an airport location.  I'm pretty stingy with that 5th star and in the face of the mournful opprobrium of the Yelp masses generally don't even consider it for fast food and chain restaurants, but in this case, I think it's warranted, so you can take that drum stick and eat it (and thank me later).",

Honestly I was quite impressed, I ordered the 4 piece chicken strips with fries, a biscuit and the legendary ice tea and it definitely hit the spot. The chicken is not overly greasy and it has a good flavor. The biscuit was hard, but maybe that's because it was the last thing I ate and it had gotten cold. The tea though - Oh man! That tea is yummy!   Just so you know, the line is long, but it goes rather quickly. The staff maybe seem rude to some, but honestly with the amount of traffic they get, they're really not going to have a 5 minute convo about what's the best item on the menu. It's CHICKEN people - Not a 4 star restaurant. Order your damn meal and keep it truck'n!",
