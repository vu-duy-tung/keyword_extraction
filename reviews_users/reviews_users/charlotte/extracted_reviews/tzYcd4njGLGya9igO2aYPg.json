I called and spoke with a nice guy on the phone and put the mgr that was super sweet on the phone and because they forgot my ranch she was going to have someone bring it right over and offered me a cookie or a drink since they forgot my ranch. I said no thank you but she still sent it and the driver was super sweet with a friendly smile and made sure I was fine. You guys made my day and remember why I love this place and the staff. My only down fall was not taking names. So I hope with the time I called in my order in you can thank them all for me.",

Do not go by the estimated time they give you on the phone, add about 15 minutes. Person on the phone said my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I told him I would show in 25 min.  Showed exactly on the time that was specified, still had to wait an extra 20 minutes.  In all fairness they had an influx of online orders come in at the same time.   However examining the assembly line, saw some idle hands.  Management needs to consider changing their process to put cashiers (if more than one available) on the assembly line. 3 cashiers standing waiting for no walk ins. 2 people visibly working on making orders.  The food is always good here though!",

Lack of consistency in preparation in a chain store violates my expectations. 2) no more soda water dispensing.  You used to get bubbles in ordinary water, now only flat water from the lemonade dispenser is available. 3) grumpy management.  The rank and file employees all smile and seem generally cheerful.  On multiple occasions I observed frowning, grimacing, and public berating of employees.  I don't want to eat somewhere when the people in charge don't look happy to be there.  \"Why do the managers always look so pissed off here?  This would never be allowed at Disney\" - my lunch date.  Came in a few days later and everybody looked much happier.  I really enjoy the soups here as much as the sandwiches, you should make sure you try plenty of both.  The cream based soups are very very rich.",

A couple hours later the cramps set in, then the nausea and vomiting and low grade fever. If I wasn't 99.9% sure it was food poisoning I would've never written this review.       On appearance the place looked very clean and the employees were all very nice so I hate to give only 1 star.

Here's what I like about this place...  *Plenty of free parking - This particular Jason's deli is in a open plaza with parking abound.  *Great Service - I have never experienced anything but superb service while patronizing this establishment.  Someone usually politely greets you when you walk in and is ready and willing to take your order or answer any questions you might have.    *Salad Bar - I don't know of many places with a GREAT salad bar here in the Charlotte area, but the salad bar at Jason's Deli has to be one of the best around!  It put's Harris Teeter's salad bar (which I love btw) to shame.  This salad bar has options like Donald Trump has wives - and that would be a lot!  They have house made dressings, garlic toast, muffins, corn bread, fresh fruit, fresh cut veggies, etc.  If you like salads, Jason's Deli is your heaven.  *Build Your Own Sandwich - I love building my own sandwich when I go to Jason's deli.  Its an option on the menu which allow you to design your own sandwich for around $6-$7.  I am especially found of the chicken salad.  I know, I know, CHICKEN SALAD?  But YES, CHICKEN SALAD!!  It is the BEST, the BEST in ALL of Charlotte!!  The secret to their chicken salad is the pineapple chunks that are mixed into the chicken salad.  Still don't believe??  Just go try it and you will be a believer.   *The Pastas - The chicken pasta primo and the chicken alfredo are tasty and extremely filling.  Due to the amount of pasta they give you, I usually stay away from the pastas when I am looking for a light meal especially during lunch time.  Never-the-less, the pastas are better than you think and make for an excellent meal on any day of the week.  This place has awesome food with a freshness you can taste!",

The pickup time was 1-1:30 so I went around 1:25 to give them time. When I walked in there was a very long line and I simply asked the cashier, \"Is this where I pickup online orders?\" She rudely said, \"There is a line\" and gestured to the line. I clarified, \"I already paid for the order, I just need to pick it up.\" At that time a guy behind her said brashly, \"We have other customers, we'll have it ready in a minute.\" It's not intuitive where pre-paid order should be picked up and they were not helpful in directing me. Upon receiving the sandwich boxes and giving them to the team, there were no condiments or silverware included. The boxes were all mislabeled so we had to shuffle to figure out what sandwiches belonged with what dessert and who ordered what. My intention was to do something thoughtful and treat my team to lunch for their hard work but unfortunately that was ruined by a poor customer experience.",

    "text": "Jason's deli is a good place to grab lunch, if you're able to sit down and eat at the establishment, but not if you have a limited lunch time and order online where it's supposed to be convenient. This is the ONLY Jason's Deli that I've been to that has greatly disappointed me. Not just once but TWO times.  Since this location is closest to my work place and I don't have much time to order during work, I like to take advantage of the online ordering system they have available before I get to work. The first time I ordered from here, I placed my order (half a tuna sandwich and a cup of pot pie soup) 3 hours ahead of time and specified the time I'd be there to pick it up(5-530). I get to the location, pay for my order and wait. About 10 minutes into my wait, the manager notifies me that they had to remake my order because they somehow made it 3 hours earlier then they were suppose to. I had to wait longer than I expected to wait and was almost late going back to work. Luckily I wasn't late but I also couldn't just sit and enjoy my food like I had intended since I was short on time.   I hadn't intended to go back but after a few months I decided to give the place a second chance since I wanted chicken pot pie soup after coming off of a 10 day cleanse. Again I played it safe and ordered my bowl of pot pie online 4 hours earlier and indicated the time(5-530) I would be in to pick it up. When I got there I payed for the order placed under my name and waited. The cashier told me my order should be ready but it wasn't when he went to check. So I sat and waited. Mind you, all I ordered was a BOWL of soup. 5 minutes, 10 minutes went by. At that point I asked how long it was going to be since apparently I was FORGOTTEN. The girl cashier went to check and informed me that it hadn't been done and was telling the kitchen to make it since I'd been waiting for a while. The manager (or that's who he seemed to be) came over and asked me how I had placed my order and I told him I placed it online. He proceeded to ask if I had received a confirmation email, which I did. He went to check on his little computer and informed me that it must not have been in their system and it was never made. But how can an order NOT be received when I received a confirmation email AND paid for it when it was under my name? I continued to wait and another 5 minutes pass and the girl cashier comes back to tell me that they were waiting on the pastry that goes with the soup to be made. At this point I am heated and wanted to just storm out but since I paid for my BOWL of soup, I waited. Finally at 5:25pm the manager is packing up the soup and handing it to me while stating \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I'll be sure to take care of the bill.\" That was an out right LIE. Don't sit there and say something you don't mean just to keep customers happy. The lie is what makes them more mad. There's no way that the order didn't exist in the system. I was simply forgotten about after I paid for my order. I placed the order 4 hours early online. I didn't realize a BOWL of soup take 4 hours and some change to get ready. Needless to say, I don't intend on wasting my time at Jason's again.",

It's a little hard getting in and our of the parking lot since Harris has those large islands - gotta make a U-turn to get back to the direction you want to go, but it's a small sacrifice compared to the salad and food offered here.

Well I needed to see with all the hoopla was about so we ventured to Jason's for an afternoon lunch.  To my surprise the menu was fantastic with lots of choices as well as a fresh salad bar.  The sandwiches were freshly made right in front of you and mine was delicious!   The sandwiches and the pickles were a little smaller than Katz but the price was a whole lot less so overall I was very satisfied with my Jason's deli lunch and in the words of the Terminator \"I'll be back!\"",

I love food from New Orleans and they have 2 of my favorites Muffalettas and Gumbo. I normally get the managers special which comes with a soup and half of sandwich these two are normally my go too.  They have great sandwiches try the New York Yankee which is comes with hot corned beef and pastrami with Swiss Cheese. The Rachel is also good it comes with turkey and Pastrami cole slaw and a pickle. They also have po boys but they don't offer fried seafood.  They have. Great selection of soups the chicken pot pie soup comes with a flaky pasty puff crust. They make a really good French onion and Irish potato soup as well but those are seasonal.  On my recent visits I had the Garden Fresh Salad bar. They offer mixed greens several pasta and side salads like bean, roasted corn and black bean salad, and potato salad. They don't have chicken or any other meat like turkey or ham on the salad bar but you can add meat for an up charge if you want.  They offer a complimentary ice cream cone for guest so be sure to take advantage. They staff is always friendly and provides great customer service.",

This deli style fast food establishment has lots of delicious and fresh options to meet everyone's needs and tastes.   There is a number of sandwich and soup options as well as my favorite, their all you can eat salad bar. The salad bar had lettuce, spring mix, and spinach as well as a number of fresh veggies, toppings, and cold salad options like pasta and bean salads. My only complaint here is that the protein options were limited to beans, eggs, and bacon, which limited what you could add. Other than that I found every other topping option great. There is also fresh bread, mini muffins, and soft serve ice cream for you to enjoy.   Overall Jason's Deli is a solid chain option for lunch.",

Second visit, the Rueben was just as big and just as juicy, but the rye was soaked with the meat juices and disintegrated with the first bite.  Order at the counter, and they call your name when it's ready. Free refills on tea and fountain drinks.  Which is good since they completely fill the cup with ice.  Time between order and food was about 20 minutes both times, right at noon time.  I think my sandwich on the 2nd visit just sat for a while before it was brought from the kitchen. There was a softball team there and it was pretty full and also a lot of to go orders.  Still a solid sandwich choice for Salem.  Compared to other area lunch spots, probably worth 4 stars, but three stars based on a national average.",

When dining out with a small - medium sized group, we try to find places that serve good food and allows us to get in and out within a reasonable amount of time. This Jason's Deli delivers on both.  The salad bar happens to be favorite with frequent diners but I prefer the sandwiches (Amy's Turkey O particularly) and soups (delish broccoli and cheese). If I'm not in the mood for a full sandwich, I'll opt for the half sandwich/soup/salad combo. They have a coca cola fountain machine that also has a dasani sparkling water option (double like).   The piece-de-resistance is the ice cream machine. Chocolate, vanilla, and/or the swirl are available to be put in a cone or bowl. I'm a cone girl and love being able to end my lunches on a sweet, creamy note.",

No customers waiting to be served and the staff of 5 people, NOT ONE PERSON acknowledged us...after waiting 15 minutes and no hey, hello, a woman walked in and was greeted immediately and the worker asked if she would allow us to be served first?!?! Are you freaking kidding me...love their food, however will NEVER GIVE THEM MY BUSINESS  Sadly I spoke to the manager on the telephone and he had no remorse or offered to rectify the situation.",

It is still a great place to grab a sandwich at, and is good for both lunch and dinner. It's a little pricier then the average sandwich place, however it is still worth a trip for lunch every now and then. I would most definitely recommend Jason's Deli as a place to eat.",

    "text": "My last visit to Jason's Deli was disappointing. I always opt for the salad bar and add chicken. First, this place is totally overpriced for what it is. The salad bar is $8.29 and to add a protein is $3.99. That means if you get a salad bar with chicken it's $13.29 after taxes. You can get a salad at any other restaurant for less than this.   I went around 7PM and some of the items on the salad bar were either empty or low. They were not doing a good job of keeping it stocked. Some of the romaine lettuce was brown. GROSS. I'm assuming that they chop it up in store. I don't understand why they wouldn't remove those pieces.   The salad bar is pretty standard. They have a couple options for lettuce - romaine, greener, and then spinach. They also have tons of vegetable options. Tons of dressing options. There is also a selection of pre-made pasta salad, potato salad, etc. One of my favorite items on the salad bar is the roasted red pepper hummus. It's delicious and goes great with the little garlic bread that they have.   My favorite part of visiting Jason's Deli is the free ice cream. It is so creamy and delicious. They should consider changing their name to Jason's ice cream - that's how good it is. However, on this trip, the cone box was empty and there were no clean dishes available by the side of the ice cream machine. I had to go to the counter and ask for a dish.   The staff wasn't doing a great job at keeping tables cleared when we were there. So if they're not keeping things stocked on the salad bar and at the beverage bar/ice cream, AND they're not keeping tables cleared... WHAT ARE THEY ALL DOING? I was really disappointed with this last trip. It just seems overpriced and that the quality isn't all that great.",
