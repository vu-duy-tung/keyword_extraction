    "text": "Good: Generally (see below) good and seemingly legitimately healthy food. On-the-bone chicken and grilled salmon specials are well-prepared and usually satisfying. Steak sandwich is good and so are the burgers, generally.  Bad: SERVICE - specifically, the attitude of a sizable handful of the employees, who for whatever reason choose not to practice common courtesy. Big contrast from a place like Grey Dog. If you order takeout, they have a habit of forgetting your drink, so double-check.   Also, food quality is sadly inconsistent, and the chicken strips are plain bad. Only the on-the-bone chicken is good.   Joe",

    "text": "The waitstaff was GREAT, so this in no way reflects them or any dissatisfaction with service.  That said, my date and I were super excited to try this place seeing rave reviews, and myself having just become vegan, and she vegetarian. However, apart from the appetizer which was good--the spinach quinoa cakes, the meal was a big let down. The vegan lasagna was simply bad. The sauce was spiced very weirdly, and that flavor permeated the dish. I took 2/3 of it home and reluctantly ate it the next day when I was hungry because I hate waste. It was no better the next day.  My date had the artichoke pasta, which was good, but SUPER garlicky, and both she and I LOVE garlic, so for us to say it was too much means something. Further, that same imbalance of spices that I experienced in the lasagna was--to a lesser extent--also present here. Lastly, the pasta was drowning in oil, so that my date couldn't eat the remaining third of her dish because it was mostly oil. That was ok with her since she was full, and I ate it having not wanted to eat my entree.  She enjoyed her beer, which was a featured or special beer, but my white wine was bleh. We didn't entertain dessert being completely disappointed, despite that we almost always order at least one.  We had a Living Social deal--only $5 off--and would not want to pay full price here. Based on all the rave reviews, maybe a bad chef was in the kitchen this day--but that's not excusable anyway. The only reason I would come back is if I had another deal, was SERIOUSLY craving garlic and wanted that dish again, or to try the veggie burger, which is not listed as vegan, so maybe not. Such a shame, because we love the idea of vegan-friendly, healthy, but delicious places.  For really good vegan food, try any of the Blossoms in the city. I have yelp reviews of them too if you want to check out what I loved :)",

We were waiting for a member of our party and our server let us hang out at the table with an appetizer and drinks for almost a half hour before he showed up and we ordered - the server was so nice, he told us to just relax and enjoy our drinks.   Highly recommend the parsley hummus and the eggplant tofu lasagna.  The lentil soup was good, not great, but the bowl was HUGE.  Drink menu is organic, slightly limited, but everything my table got was really good.  Overall great service, a quirky vibe, and plenty of delicious veggie options made it a great night.",

    "text": "Wooha! Just when you thought it couldn't get better!  I've been going to siggys in Brooklyn for a while and was excited to finally check out the manhattan branch. I went for dinner with my sister's family - 2 adults and 2 kids. We were able to make a reservation for the same day and the lovely hostess called to confirm a few hrs before.  As sometimes happens with kids, my sister was delayed getting ready and they were kind enough to push back our reservation by half an hour and still keep the high chair for us.  The food between the two branches is consistent - and consistently good! We had: - spinach quinoa cakes - personal favorite! Quinoa in a texture so different that even my sister who's def not a quinoa fan loved it. - sweet potato black bean cakes - num num! Love me some beansy goodness. Great texture and the sauce on top is excellent. - grilled artichokes - hard to choose between this and the quinoa cakes. It's like picking your favorite child.. The artichokes are of really high quality.  My entree was the daily special of wild king salmon with black rice and fennel salad. So good! The salmon was perfectly cooked to my medium order - and you could actually taste the difference of a quality sourced salmon, and not some frozen piece. The flavors on the plate were beautifully balanced - the richness of the olive tomato salmon crust was toned down by the simple yet properly cooked black rice. The raw fennel salad was quite summery, fresh, and brightened up the dish.  For dessert we got the vegan choc chip cookie and brownie and coconut milk ice cream - I'm not a fan of vegan dessert but these were surprising - the cloves in the cookies is a great twist and the brownie.. Well.. Who doesn't love chocolate!  I have a feeling ill be coming here a lot.  The location and atmosphere really allowed for a comfortable dinner conversation. The decor is pleasant and warm, and the dining room is spacious enough, rare in ny, such that you almost feel isolated at your table, enjoying the meal with your loved ones.",

My friend had a salad with chicken and loved it. The restaurant itself is quite nice though it is a bit loud from all of the conversation and echo. Still that should not stop you from enjoying an extraordinarily good meal. This place is a winner. I would go back in a heartbeat.",

When I used to live in NoHo, I stumbled upon it around 10pm during a sweltering summer day when I was craving a smoothie, and the alien sign outdoor caught my attention. Ever since then (which was summer 2014), I've gone back here about 20 times and I can't say better things about it.  As a San Francisco native, this place makes me feel more at home than anywhere else I've been to in New York. The decor is wooden, rustic, and has string lights and most of the food is organic-- also, all the beer and wine is organic and gluten free as well.   Everything here is fabulous. I've had the smoothies, turkey burger, black bean burger, green quinoa salad (add chicken to it-- it's amazing), the tofu lasagna dish, the arthichoke pasta, and the seafood specials. No complaints anywhere. Every dish is thoughtfully prepared and has a lot of flavor. Not to mention, prices are very reasonable.  Lastly, the staff is unbelievable. Everyone is so nice and will tell you happily about each item on the menu.  Vegetarians and vegans love this place, and so do carnivores. I love you Siggy's!! Please come back to Brooklyn. (They used to have a BK location but it closed down :( Sad.)",

New York boasts some pretty impressive vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurants (though we could certainly use a Native Foods or two!).   Siggy's is no exception.  The Live Earth salad is my standby - a heaping of delicious vegetables on a bed of greens. They're really generous with the avocado too!  The turkey and salmon burgers are top-notch, though I wish they came with sides. They're not super filling on their own, so I'd recommend getting a side of roasted potatoes for an additional $3.50.   They have an extensive selection of smoothies and juices, which all sound really good and aren't too expensive. The almond protein is yummy. I make my own smoothies so I'm quite picky, but Siggy's uses some high-quality ingredients.  Siggy's is chill, cozy and welcoming, though service can be a *little* slow sometimes.   All in all, a great pick for vegetarians and omnivores alike :)",

While I didn't try any of the bakery items (YET) my friend and I sat down for a late lunch and started with the spinach cakes. Which were these two circular spinach cakes with a sort of pico de gallo, but not really pico de gallo, on top. Very yummy, I highly recommend. Then we had to get the vegetarian lasagna because thats what most of the pictures and reviews on here were about- and I am so happy. Its definitely the best decision I've made all day. It's absolutely guilt free, because its all vegetables and theres no pasta in it at all. Its layers of eggplant and broccoli, perhaps cauliflower and then vegan ricotta (whatever that is). We also decided to split the live earth salad which came with a bunch of sprouts on top- which i love. The salad was a little skimpy on the avocado, otherwise everything here is perfect and I can't wait to come back!",

My boyfriend at the time got gluten free marinara pasta, against my suggestion because he is not gluten free. He said exactly what I expected it's okay but I wouldn't eat it again. I think it's very difficult to make gluten free pasta taste good when you've had the real deal. I just am not impressed because it is possible to make vegan and gluten free food tasty. That is why places like by Chloe are so successful.",

Between us, we got three of the smoothies (Green Alien Quencher, Almond Protein *Raw, and Coco Peanut Brain) all of which were delicious. For food, we got Black Bean Sweet Potato Cakes, Wild Salmon Burger, Macaroni & Cheese, Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna, the Farmers Omelet, and the Pancakes.  Both the cakes and lasagna were a weird kind of mushyish texture, although they did taste pretty decent. The Wild Salmon Burger was really good, as was the Farmers Omelet. To me, the pancakes were a weird flavor, but I'm pretty sure that's just because they were buckwheat (I think). The Mac & Cheese was different, but good.  The one thing I really have an issue with is that my uncle asked our waiter if the pancakes were vegan (he eats vegan and wanted to check) the waiter told us they were, but after he'd already had a few bites the waiter came back and said the pancakes actually had egg in them. That's seriously not cool - waiter's should know their menu and if they don't know, they should check instead of just making something up.",

Having been to Siggy's twice in two days, I've had the pleasure of trying the absolutely outrageous roasted artichoke salad, which was sprinkled with a tangy, fresh parmesan cheese; the freshest beet carrot apple juice I've had in a while, to which I added some ginger (and when I didn't really like the taste of the first round of the juice, the barista remade it without complaint or extra charge until it was perfect); and a delectable bone-dry cappuccino.  I work in the area, and am stoked to go back for lunch on Monday!",

My wife forgets exactly what she got the first time, but I got lentil soup and rice I think and it was so delicious and huge that we took some home and enjoyed it later. We went again last night and had the spinach burger wrap and the spinach cake appetizer thing (I think the latter is just a salsa topped version of the former) and also amazing. Their juices and smoothies are also quite good. We will be going again for sure.",

As with most vegetarian/vegan places on weekends, it was busy, but not too crowded. We both ordered the no noodle lasagna (I think it was vegetarian?), and we both loved it! The sauce was so flavorful, and I didn't miss the noodles. We were both so full after we finished it, so we didn't get a chance to order anything else. For $15, I think that was a pretty great meal. Spending less than $20 after tax and tip on a satisfying dinner is very rare in Manhattan, so I was very happy about that. On top of the more than reasonable prices, it seems like Siggy's really cares about where their ingredients come from and providing delicious, healthy foods. I love supporting places like this.   The ambience is nice, and would also be great for casual dates. The menu seems to have a little something for everyone, although it is mainly vegetarian. Our server was very nice. I did think it was weird that she asked if we wanted bread (We said yes, but I was worried that we'd be charged a ridiculous amount for it. We weren't), but I guess that makes sense since there are probably a good number of diners that are gluten-free. I'll definitely be returning.",

    "text": "For the most part, I'm all for efforts that encourage the consumption of \"good for you\" food - food that's raised sustainably, organically, and locally wherever possible. When a friend of mine suggested Siggy's for dinner one evening, I was slightly hesitant given the amount of emphasis the business placed on these key words, but a quick skim of the reviews and menu beforehand, and I was pretty much won over.  Arriving just shy of 7PM, I was greeted by a fairly casual, spacious dining area, complete with a (juice) bar at the front with the majority of seating towards the back of the room. Despite the fact that the majority of tables weren't taken, I had to wait until my friend arrived before we both could be seated. We were quickly given menus, the daily specials, and glasses of water, and spent the next few minutes trying to figure out what to order.  Siggy's should be applauded on their commendable menu. Not only does it utilize \"good for you\" food, it incorporates them across a whole spectrum of dishes, including salads, soups, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, and more. There's something for every taste available, and specific dietary allergies or restrictions are accommodated as well.  I opted for the Beef Burger ($11) with a side of Roasted Herb Potatoes (+$4). The burger is lightly seasoned, topped with lettuce and tomato, and sandwiched between two soft buns. The patty was a little overcooked beyond my requested medium, but was juicy and had a good flavor to each bite. The roasted potatoes were a good decision, in hindsight, as they were tender and warm on the inside, but with a satisfying crisp exterior, and generously seasoned and salted. My friend's Vegan (& Gluten Free) Lasagna was equally impressive, comprised of roasted eggplant slices as substitutes for the pasta, and filled with layers of vegetables, tofu ricotta, and soy cheese in between. An aromatic garlic tomato sauce rounded out the plate, and made for a filling and healthy entree.  I'd come back to Siggy's, without a doubt. Serving tasty, yet healthy, food is a balance that some places have yet to find, but this restaurant has certainly found its stride. Although I have yet to see an alien [1] dining here, they must have good taste if that's the case.  -- [1] A sign outside the restaurant reads \"Aliens Eat Free\".",

Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait to be seated.  Yay!   I got the gluten free, vegan lasagna.  It was freakin delicious as many other reviewers have mentioned on Yelp.  It was also HUGE and I couldn't finish my last bite of it.  Some yelpers noted that the lasagna has soy cheese.  I didn't want to have fake, processed soy cheese but it turned out that they no longer put soy cheese in the lasagna.  It's just layers of veggies, tofu ricotta and marinara sauce - perfect!! The marinara sauce was a bit too sour/strong for my taste but i still freakin loved it!!!  Hubby got the salmon burger.  He said the salmon patty melted in his mouth but the portion was too small for him.  Oh well - how many NYC restaurants serve portions big enough for a grown man? We were more than happy to move onto another place for his second bite.   Besides the great tasting dishes, we also loved the decor of the restaurant!! Loved the alien theme!!! It was just such a cute place!!! All the servers were super cool and nice too.  The door and windows were open in the front and the back windows were open as well.  Both the front and the back seating areas were nice and cozy.  Would definitely and certainly return to Siggy's soon.",

I ordered the salmon burger and it was whipped up in about 10 minutes and OMG it is legitimately one of the best burgers I've ever had. The salmon patty was ridiculously juicy, well seasoned(as advertised) and just tasted so fresh -- held together by one of the softest, lightest, fluffiest burger buns ever. The avocado and vegan mayo was super creamy and the perfect accompaniment along with the fresh, crisp greens. I can't remember the last time I ate so quickly -- I finished it in about 8 seconds and OMG I just can't say enough good things about this fantastic burger. I honestly do not know how I will be able to bypass this burger and try anything else on the menu..although the treats by the counter looked mighty good too.   I will most definitely be back time and time again. Salmon Burger. Get it! It is INCREDIBLE. If healthy always tasted this good...  (Going tomorrow.)",

I have eaten here several times and vastly preferred the food when this space housed the now-defunct \"Rice\". \"Organic\" is great and everything, and the space is warm and welcoming, decked out in inviting wood and serviced by very kind and professional wait staff. Because of this, I might even come here again in a pinch.  But every time I look at this high rating, I think \"maybe last time was just my misfortune\".  No more.  Every time I order chicken breast here, it is overcooked and barely chewable. Everything else on the menu is extremely bland, and the seasoning on most dishes is best defined by \"mildly salted.\" The prices, in my opinion, exceed the \"$$\" for the quantity that you get, and given the extremely mediocre quality of the preparation, (regardless of how fresh or \"organic\" the ingredients are), I can't be complicit in this mass Yelp-aided deception any longer.  Come here for a warm, quirky vibe, kind staff, and to pretend that you are doing something extraordinarily kind to your GE tract.

They have sandwiches, salads, burgers, etc.  I tried the hummus as an appetizer and it was delicious and seasoned well. For my entree I had the salmon burger. The portion was good. I was too full to finish it so I had to remove the bun and eat the filling. Next time I will opt for no bun and just greens for an extra $1. I added the roasted potatoes to my entree for $4. They were so yummy and cut into thin slices like potato chips.  For drinks, they serve a variety of smoothies and juices. I tried the green alien quencher which has cucumbers, kale leaves, mint, pineapple and orange juice. It was very refreshing. I would definitely come back to try the other drinks and also a vegan dish.",

    "text": "This place is all about good, clean flavorful food! I ended up here on a weeknight after some shopping in SoHo. This is what you come to expect when you see a restaurant that appeals to vegans and meat eaters alike, flavor! Every dish we had used fresh veggies to improve the meal.   We started off with some hummus. There was an extra $2 up charge to get it with cut up veggies rather than bread. No big deal. The hummus was the right balance of garlic, spices, and they add parsley. The parsley really gives the hummus a fresher, clean taste.   I would definitely recommend getting the chicken soup. We added rice to it and that gave it some extra heartiness. The broth was excellent and really brought together the soup.   We split the flank steak sandwich and the chicken hero. We got both on the multigrain bread. You need a hearty bread with either sandwich to stand up against the weight of all the meat and toppings. Both were a good size sandwich. I loved the mushrooms and carmelized onions on the flank steak. The marinade on the chicken hero should be sold by itself.    Great experience. Fun staff. Check out their restaurant grade on their door. You will have a good laugh.",

    "text": "Came here with a non-vegan, non-gluten-free but health-conscious friend who was perhaps more wowed by the food than I was (and I was pretty damned impressed), because she decided to order a vegan gluten-free dish and she LOVED it.  We didn't plan it at all but we ended up getting the same thing: Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna, even though there were plenty of vegan gluten-free items clearly marked as such on the menu. Our very helpful server highly recommended it, especially because it had their house-made garlic tomato sauce that he said we would love.  And man, he was NOT kidding. The balance of garlic and slight sweetness from the tomatoes was like crack. I think I would have happily drank that sauce as a soup or something all by itself.  I've had many vegan gluten-free attempts at \"lasagna\" with various degrees of success, but this Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna was perhaps the most satisfying one of them all. Lots of tender vegetables and both tofu ricotta and soy cheese. YUM.  I definitely will want to come back and try the other dishes on their menu!",

My rec for brunch is the shakshuka. perfect poached eggs. Thick delicious tomato broth with all the yummy pepper/onion. Loooove the hot sauce they had on hand.   Super delicious black bean and sweet potato cakes were awesome and a pretty decent amount of food for only 8.   Fantastic array of raw juice/green drinks and smoothies.   I had the berries wine cooler for brunch and man I am a happy tipsy lady.   Service is a bit slow because they're so busy and everything is made so fresh to order. They won't seat you until your whole party is there on account of the limited space though. Very nice smiley super organic vegan-y zeny staff (And one snooty girl).",

    "text": "I'm not a vegan or vegetarian. I don't lead a gluten-free, lactose-free, or paleo diet. I enjoy tofu, but I don't need it dressed up as a turkey or pretend beef. I don't swear by organic, gmo-free foods either. I grew up in an Chinese household so I eat tofu regularly and I love the taste of most and any soy product. I will admit though that I do not like tempeh. Tempeh is dry, tasteless, bland, and really does make me think of cardboard. But every now and then I'm in the mood for good food, cooked clean, and eating without feeling like I need a nap afterwards. We're in the trend of comfort food, greased up, fried up, anything caloric bombing app, entree, and dessert. Well, Siggy's presents a much needed break.  Siggy's is one of those places where you want good food, a relaxing environment, a bit of a lively ambiance without it being overwhelming. You leave feeling guilt-free and in the mood for a walk because you can and not because you need it.  Here's what we ordered: - Eggplant Tofu Ricotta Lasagna: RECOMMENDED. This is a big, big portion. I don't know why everyone has this broccoli-esque appalling reaction to tofu. I love tofu. I can eat it by itself and think it's enjoyable. I don't think it tastes like a bland sponge. But then again I also love broccoli. When you get the plate in front of you, you can't even tell it's made of tofu. There is roasted, thinly sliced eggplant, grated carrots liberally distributed throughout and an absolutely wonderful tomato garlic sauce. I loved it. For all those who are not vegan, ask for the freshly grated Parmesan. They gave you a good amount of it to sprinkle on top. That added richness, depth, and saltiness from the cheese adds a whole new level.  - Salmon burger on sliced multigrain: RECOMMENDED. This was delicious! You can tell there are no fillers when you bite into it and all you see is the fish flaking apart. I hate it when you bite into a salmon patty and it looks like a ground up meatball with a lot of breadcrumbs and egg as a binder. The avocado added a perfect amount of creaminess. I'm indifferent about the vegan mayo. I honestly didn't think it was necessary. They probably should switch it out for something different like roasted red pepper/sundried tomato spread, olive tapenade, or maybe even a sriracha aioli. Otherwise, this was a deliciously satisfying salmon burger.  Service is friendly, attentive, and overall welcoming. The restaurant is comfortable and relaxing.",

I'm used to getting hosed on gf options and paying full price for a tiny sandwich, but they just gave me 2! Awesome.

Usually eating burgers leaves me feeling sick and heavy. Not this one. Having a gluten & dairy intolerance is hard going out to eat. I was able to have a wonderful burger on a gluten free bun without having to go to a vegan restaurant with no meat! Highly recommend this place for people with sensitivities or just anyone who wants a good healthy meal!",

Thank you Siggy for providing a warm, cozy place to eat delicious food, drink delicious wine, and talk to friends.",

It's really accessible from the Bleeker street station  I ordered to go (all vegan): the requisite Eggplant/tofu/veggie lasagna - tofu and boccoli/carrot/onion mash between layers of sauteed eggplant and smothered in a hearty marinara. The Garlic and artichoke pasta with tofu fingers. A cookie and a brownie  It was all delicious. The pasta was buttery (flavor not actual butter) and the lasagna was a good meal. (I'll update on the brownie once I eat it) The cookie wasn't really my style: it was unique with the clove taste and the crumbly/chewyness - but I ate the whole thing.  I thought, from the reviews, there would be more vegan variety on the menu - these options are delicious but there are only 4 items that are vegan. I still struggled to decide between those 4. But don't go in with a party of 6 vegans and think you'll all be getting something different.  The staff is adorable. :)",

Don't you have something better to do? Like getting back to Siggy's?  The food here is healthy and delicious. Best of all, it's affordable and without all the typical pretension you get from restaurants with all organic, locally sourced ingredients.  It's more hippie than haute. More Austin than Manhattan. I mean they freaking have drawings of aliens all over.   So what are you waiting for? If you're looking for a good, guilt-free meal, get yoself over to Siggy's.

I called 15 minutes in advance and asked if there were any seats available - they told me to get there as soon as I could because they cold only hold the seats for 20 minutes. So we made it in time.  Mum got the wild salmon burger - and she loved it. This meant that it had to be good because my mum's a somewhat picky eater. I got the eggplant veggie & tofu lasagna - and it was SO good. Like I'm craving it right now so good - and it's really filling for a vegetarian/vegan dish. The best part was that I didn't need to fall into a food coma afterwards - I felt ready for a yoga class (and I ended up doing a bit at home).  We also got the red beets, orange & kale salad with the optional goat cheese. I hadn't realized that my mum disliked goat cheese, so I ended up eating all of it - which made almost every bite of salad I had seem a bit too sour or too tangy. If I hadn't eaten all that goat cheese, I may have enjoyed the salad more (my mum certainly liked it) - but I did have all of it, and my taste buds were very mad at me whilst eating the salad.  Overall, I'd definitely come back - it was a cute place and that lasagna was the perfect meal for a cold and rainy day. (Or just any day, really.)",

The food was delicious, I had the salmon burger and our friends had the salmon dinner with black rice and kale. All delicious! Service was great, ended up staying pretty late and found out at the end of the day the wait staff eats after the shift. You know the food is prepared well if the wait staff will sit down and eat it!

The lasagna was super filling without all the added calories. You could see a lot of shredded veggies hidden inside all the goodness. Also, the tomato marinade - ah!  Tried the Almond Protein (Raw Almond Butter, Dates, Banana & Almond Milk). Was pretty good! A bit too sweet to my taste, more like a milkshake. But perfect dessert.

Soups are yummy and hearty (They let me combine them as well, not sure if it's the norm but I appreciate it :)  Almond chicken kicks ass and tastes great with rice and kale slaw.  Side bread was hearty and yummy with the accompanying olive oil.  Been here about 5 times I'd say and each time I visit, I thoroughly enjoy myself.  Another note is that the employees seem like a close knit group, or hey even like a family (what's that? lol)  Great energy, great food, great experience.",

It's a kinda hippie, grass-rootsy type of vibe - for my Bay Area peeps, think of the lower Haight.    I had a bomb-a** tofu-avocado salad, veg quinoa-spinach burger wrap topped off with a mega greens juice.  On a Sunday, I sat with my girlfriend for a couple hours just chillin, enjoying the comfort.  It's just that kind of place.  Did I say plenty-o-vegetarian?   AND for a $$ PRICE-POINT!  Done and done.",

Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna - as recommended from fellow yelpers, I do agree this is a must try. It's flavorful with no bad carbs by using eggplants as paste noodle.  Wild Salmon Burger, with a side of roasted potatoes - they use vegan mayo for this which is a plus for my friend. I got to try it and it's pretty juicy and well seasoned. However, the side of roasted potatoes was pretty bland.",

Lucky for me, my boyfriend's sister is close friends with Siggy. (Insert my vegetarian recovery and savior.) There are not enough words to say how much I enjoyed my experience at this alien/veggie-themed eatery tucked away in the NoHo neighborhood. From my almond butter date shake to the best meatloaf I have ever had (and there wasn't even meat in it!), I'm drooling on the keyboard as we speak. What made the meatloaf exceptional? Ground up veggies like carrots, brocolli and eggplant mixed with tofu ricotta all smothered in a made-from-scratch tomato sauce. It was made with love. You could taste it with every bite.  Two other factors that made my experience 10 stars (errr 5): -cozy setting and decor - I loved our table in the rear with window open to a lush mini courtyard/green space -my salad topped with marinated tofu, avocado, carrot and sprouts also knocked my socks off. I'm certain this one meal packed enough nutrients to make up for my two day hiatus.   Thank you, Siggy. If you want to send me the meatloaf recipe, I wouldn't fight you. ;)",

The interior is kind of dim.  They don't just serve good food here, they serve awesome food. I sat at the bar waiting 30 min. for my chronically late dining partner. I missed about 5 tables, but by the time he came a table was ready for us. They offer you fresh, healthy multi-grain bread with olive oil if you want.  Salmon Burger on Brioche w/ Herb Roasted Sweet Potatoes -  Salmon burger is so freaking good. I tried a bite of my friend's before in the Brooklyn location and tried to find another place that sells salmon burgers ever since. I couldn't find another place so I returned here to get one. The patty was smaller than I expected, but it seemed like it had no fillers as listed on the menu. The herb roasted sweet potatoes are an extra $4, but get them. I saw them just chilling on a shelf above the grill, so was afraid they would be overcooked and mushy. This was not the case. They were so crispy and well seasoned. The brioche bun kind of swallowed up the patty, but it was super soft and fluffy.  Beef Ragu Pasta Bowl - Generally you expect pasta to be rich and carb heavy. This pasta tasted fresh and healthy without sacrificing delicious flavor. I loved the herbs and the beef was tender. You get to choose between whole wheat or brown rice pasta. Be warned, the whole wheat is a very fibery pasta. The pasta is more expensive at $17, but they give you a huge portion.  While waiting for my dining partner to show up, I was able to get a peak into the kitchen. I saw so many delicious orders being prepared. Now I'm dying to go back to try their Garlic Herbs Olive Oil & Artichokes Pasta, Macaroni & Cheese, and Chicken Milanese.",

I love how they have options for everyone, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free and omnivores as well and they gracefully agree to adjustments in the menu.   I've had:  - The Black Bean burger which has a spicy mayo on it that elevates the flavor I don't think I've had a more filling vegetarian burger.   - The Almond Protein shake but with Coconut Milk instead of Almond.. it's fresh, it packs a protein punch and keeps you going during a 3 hour rehearsal.   - A Moroccan chicken special that was incredibly flavorful with hints of paprika.   All their products are organic which is a plus since there are so many chemicals in the food nowadays.",

The staff is incredibly friendly and super knowledgable and passionate about their menu options.   I wish I had gone more times, but the one time I went was fantastic. I had a steak sandwich that was so perfectly prepared. The helping was large and I left full. I love cheap food but I love even more quality cheap food.   This place is perfect for a lunch or dinner meal with friends.",

Ordered a chai latte which was a little underwhelming and also got a latte which was pretty good. They had good juice options so that is probably the way to go rather than coffee/chai.  The food had great flavors; ordered the turkey burger with cheddar which was not greasy and was highly spiced but in a really interesting and tasty way. We also got the hummus plate which was also really good- large serving of hummus. I would have preferred pita bread as opposed to ciabatta but it wasn't a biggie. The server offered more bread since we had so much hummus left but which we opted to let it go unfinished, as it was very filling! Great value for what you get.

Food -       1) Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna - even the meat lovers would enjoy this dish!!      2) Beef Ragu Pasta Bowl - This is what I ordered and it was so mind blowing, my fiance and cousin kept on taking bites.  The spices in this dish were amazing.  The main spice is cumin and it  was a perfect amount.  The beef was so tender and the pasta was al dente.  There was a lot of meat, so I took my leftovers home and made more pasta and had it for lunch the next day.      3) Roasted Sweet Potatoes - i love cooking, I've cooked sweet potatoes many times, but I NEED to figure out how the roasted sweet potatoes are as good as it is at Siggy's.  It's not extremely soft as how it usually is when I have sweet potatoes.   If I lived near this restaurant, I would surely be a regular!!!",

Moroccan Chick Peas & Spinach Bowl - With Added chicken - This was nice and warm and also filling with the added chicken.  Though the chicken was a tad on the dry side, probably would try it with Tofu next time.  It was a bit on the thick side, but that is fine, as I enjoyed it that way.  Drink Flu Defense - It was ok, can taste a hint of the ginger, mostly on the bottom so definitely could have stirred it more to get it more mixed around.  Lemon taste kind of overwhelmed the flavor, it was just ok for me.  Will try a different one next time.",

Various salads and other organic dishes that are highly customizable to add proteins/burger patties or additional sides.   Dinner is solid too. Makes for a good date spot as it is charming at night without trying too hard. The thyme chicken breast packs flavor as does the ragu pasta.

What happens when you don't feel bad for eating \"healthier\" alternatives for food? You overeat. And that's what I sure did! I had a salmon burger along with my brother and we split the vegan lasagna because we were just too curious. A lasagna made of just tofu and eggplant, strange but really not because it was genius! Somehow the lasagna didn't oddly topple over, nor was it bland because the tomato sauce was overflowing with the right aroma and flavor. And because of the tofu, it was almost extremely filling so I now know why one small/medium sized piece counts as one whole entree.  By the time we devoured that and struggled through our salmon burgers because the toasted multi-grain bread couldn't handle all that salmon meat, we could barely move. So of course, we wash everything down with some organic drinks - a sweet cider for him, and a chenin blanc wine for me. I was so happy with my meal, I couldn't resist getting a vegan&gluten-free chocolate chip cookie on my way out...and silly me, it was $4! Even with all that food, I wasn't taken by surprise by a painful food coma but rather a full tummy that was stuffed all night till the next morning. Just proves that natural foods make your tummy happier and my tummy would love to venture back to Siggys.",

My bae got the all natural pan seared chicken breast marinated in fresh herbs, served with whole grain brown rice and his choice of veggies was the spinach sauteed with garlic (gluten free dish). He thought it was very soggy, and more reminiscent of wilted spinach. He also said it was too garlicky. I had a bite of his chicken and it was pretty good.  I got the eggplant veggie and tofu lasagna which did not contain noodles (yay!. This dish consisted of roasted Eggplants with lots of Vegetables and tofu ricotta, topped with soy cheese and homemade garlic tomato sauce. It was vegan and gluten free.  I have to say I was alarmed when they brought out a huge dish filled with tomato sauce, given I was wearing a white blouse. My fears were totally warranted as I did manage to splash some on my shirt (ugh). They probably could've cut down on the sauce a bit.   We got a side of roasted sweet potatoes which were delicious and plenty for the two of us to share.  Overall my tummy was happy - The portions are really generous so I was able to take home half of my noodle free eggplant lasagna for the next day's dinner after eating the other half and splitting the sweet potatoes with the boyfriend.  I was tempted to get the starter (listed as snacks on the menu) black bean sweet potato cakes or the quinoa spinach cakes, and I'm kind of glad I didn't. Our neighbors got them and they were really teeny tiny for the $8 you pay for them.  Our waiter was okay. He was a bit hipstery and didn't know what we were talking about when we originally asked about their website dinner specials listed for manhattan that was supposed to be avail after 5pm (we got there at 5:10). He said we were too early for it despite the website that appeared to be updated daily, and that we'd have to wait about 30 or so minutes before they even decided on what specials they'd offer.  That's the only reason this is a 3 and not a 4 star review. Get it together people!",

Even though my friend and I sat around the corner from the front of the house, the waitress made sure to walk by frequently to glance at our table in case we needed any attention. At one point, she noticed the bottle of water on our table was getting low and came by to replace it with a fresh one without even interrupting our conversation which was really incredibly thoughtful.  Back to the food! The drawback to a 100% vegan burger without egg whites is that the patty fell apart as soon as I picked it up! Let's just say that things got *very* messy trying to eat it like a burger, but you'll be fine if you just start off using a knife and fork.  Don't spring for the soy cheese, it has no taste whatsoever and doesn't even melt, which was a huge disappointment to a former cheese lover like myself.  I also recommend asking for vegan mayonnaise on the side if you order the roasted herb sweet potatoes because the two of them together are a synergy of awesome flavors!",

(which might become kind of endearing) Because right when you walk into Siggy's, you'll feel like home.    When possible, they ask you where you want to be seated. I love sitting in the back closer to the fireplace. The lighting is comfortable and cozy, and the decor is bright, colorful, and tasteful. Take a visit to the bathroom to read some inspirational quotes from Martha Graham and MLK Jr. (not too long of a visit, since it's a one-staller).   The food is organic and healthy. I've tried several of their soups, and they are delicious! Try the option of adding quinoa!  When I called for delivery, they were so polite and honest about how backed up they were. They apologized and said it would be quite a long wait- and I loved that they were so sincere about it.   They have healthy brunch options, and are very accommodating when it comes to making the plates vegan. The quinoa spinach cakes are delicious!   I can't wait to come back and try their smoothies. Yay Siggy's, with your out-of-this-world food! (yes, allusion to the alien intended).",

    "text": "I was pleasantly impressed by Siggy's, a very comfortable cozy restaurant with a fireplace, a very good selection of food, and a very disciplined all organic/natural consciousness throughout their restaurant. I had glanced at the reviews before coming and the food was even better than what I was expecting it to be.   They are very big on all natural, all organic and environmental-friendly serving and food. Even the ketchup that I got for my organic grass-fed beef burger was an Annie's all organic ketchup. My brother got the garlic pasta and the chicken special, which were both delicious. The chicken was very tender and seasoned beautifully, and my burger was fresh and was also flavored immensely well. Both of our meals were extremely satisfying and we left happy.   The place itself is very down-to-earth, it has a humble appearance with its wooden table and chairs, the fireplace, and modest decor. They have a cute menu that has a small section of their food mantra if you choose to read it, and all of their food is very reasonably priced. This restaurant is also nicely tucked away in a side street off of Houston, so it's a nice little neighborhood gem that is definitely thriving with fans. I'll be keeping this place in my book to come into again.  Edit: I'd also like to mention that my brother gets take-out from Siggy's all the time, the Grass-Fed All Organic Burger, which he loves. So if you're looking for a quick meal to pick-up, or delivery, Siggy's is definitely a great option",

It's like any vegan restaurant in NYC except it's not vegan - (1) the cooking does not require much technique, (2) the seasoning is quite heavy, (3) a strong emphasis on health. I wanted a salad and asked my waiter which he recommended out of the live earth and raw slaw. I was so disappointed when I dug into the live earth salad which he suggested because it is basically just a house salad with avocado and a few red pepper and onion strips. The black bean burger patty I chose to top it was good though. The juices are great and interesting but expensive. Staff is really good looking and friendly.",

So yeah, GREAT food, cute atmosphere. Came here for lunch the other day just before the lunch rush (get there before 12:30pm). Ordered one of the flu juices because I was feeling under the weather... it seemed HEALTHY, I guess. But I did feel better afterwards SO I guess it worked.  For lunch, got the lentil soup and the tuna sandwich. The soup was fantastic and perfectly flavored and the tuna was good, although not the best tuna sandwich in the world (although that was probs because of the lack of some full fat mayo). My coworkers got the raw salad and the chicken sandwich and both were very happy with their meals.  Would definitely be back and can't wait to try more of the menu esp the lasagna. If they cooked for me every day and for every meal, I think I'd basically be the healthiest person in the world.",

They have an attractive and friendly staff here, both male and female and a casually elegant dining room you wouldn't expect from a place that makes its bones on vegan/organic/gluten-free/healthy food. You can linger for minutes or hours, at least it feels that way.  Also somewhat surprisingly, Siggy's serves meat and fish dishes. On my last visit I had the flank steak sandwich, a perfect portion of juicy beef on a ciabatta roll, with a small side salad. Last time I had the wild salmon burger, totally delicious. Plenty of add-ons are available if you're in the mood for something less healthy, and there are many appetizers and sides I've yet to try.  Fast becoming my go-to \"health\" eatery.",

Food was more than worth the wait.  The salmon burger is amazing!  Also highly recommend the spinach cakes as a starter.  Service was wonderful.  The place is amazing you can really customize what you want.  Most entrees like the burger could come on a bun, gluten free bun, or over greens.  Also excellent selection of fresh juices, creative smoothies, and teas.  The place also features a lot of gluten free baked goods and many people where coming in buying from the coffee shop component of the store purchasing baked goods and smoothies.    Also something to think about for groups, no more than 2 credit cards per table!  However it is a small place so depending on the size of the group might not be the best idea.  Smaller groups definitely!  Go now before it's gone!!",

    "text": "Stopped into Siggy's Good Food with 2 of my friends, one of whom has celiac and can't eat gluten, after a yoga class in Noho. It was pretty close and a nice day so we walked in and were immediately seated. The place has a fun and unique feel to it -- the restaurant's macot is a little alien, while the entire inside is wooden and natural feeling. And the food really is good.  A lot of the options here are vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free friendly, but they have a bunch of options if you're not, like me. I copped the iced coffee and Happy Beef Burger, which were both delicious. The coffee is served in this really fun glass, and it was not bitter, but rich. Honestly, the burger looked like it might taste like the ground, but it was some of the best beef I've had in a while. Plus, the greens on it were so flavorful, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of a burger in a healthy eating restaurant. I also ordered a side of roasted potatoes, which we thin slices, not mini potatoes -- but still no complaints, they were cooked to perfection.  As with all healthy eating places, there's a literal price -- the burger and potatoes were $17, which is pretty steep for a burger. My friends got salads, which were massive and apparently tasty and flavorful as well. Service was also a tad bit slow, but because we weren't in a rush, it wasn't a huge deal -- we were just hungry!   Siggy's Good Food really does the name justice. Check it out if you're in Soho.",

    "text": "You will never just happen upon this place so I'm glad they have a popular restaurant next door.  The word \"hidden gem\" is used way too much but I'm not sure of another way to describe this place.  I know they're new but I'm just surprised I hadn't heard anything about it.    The food tastes extremely fresh with a TON of flavor.  When I think of a place that has organic options and a lot of gluten free menu items, I assume it's going to be overpriced and lack in flavor.  Definitely not the case here.    The order:  Crostini - avocado, lemon, and cracked salt and pepper. Exactly what I was looking for.  You may think $3 is too expensive for a crostini but this thing was overflowing with avocado that had the absolute perfect texture.  Can't wait to try the other ones.  Beef Kabob Hero - I got mine on ciabatta but you can also get a GF wrap or greens instead.  This was quite possibly the best sandwich I've had in Charlotte.  I was originally going to get the steak sandwich, but someone in an earlier review mentioned the cilantro habanero mayo on the kabob so I went with that and was very please.  Absolutely massive flavor on this sandwich, and it comes with some greens on the side as well.  Outside of the food, which is 5 stars on it's own but the cashier was extremely pleasant and welcoming.  The vibe is very relaxed, almost like a coffee shop (they do have wifi, I believe).  Awesome place, and can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "A friend & I decided to pop our heads in here for a bite and wow the minute we walked in there was this amazing smell in the air! We did not even look at the menu before being seated. When we was sat down and actually took a look at the menu, we both were like where are we again? We realized after 10 mins that we were at a vegan spot. My friend had the turkey burger with sweet potatoes fries , and I have to say for myself that burger was delicious. There was a hint of ginger that made the burger, it was not over powered & tender. I had a side of Mac & Cheese & sweet potatoes fries . The MC was pretty good, I felt like something was missing but it had a great amount of cheese & my favorite mozzarella. I added a sprinkle of salt and it did justice, the sweet potatoes fries are not the reg fries, they're cut into slices & seasoned to a touch. We both decided we will return and try other stuff on the menu! Love that they sell fresh green juice.  Update: Do have a shot if you feeling under the weather. I had a 2oz Lemon & Ginger shot. Wow it's powerful, the ginger is so potent! I literally felt like my ears were going to bleed lol. I have a terrible cold & decided to have a shot but it won't cure me in one day.",

I usually sat outside in Brooklyn but that option is packed away here on Elizabeth street on this cold rainy week in Fall.  I had a special dish of beef stew which was healthier than the usual stock made by my mother but still meaty and potato-y. Washed this down with a young coconut. I think coconuts are my favorite part of this alien friendly restaurant.  My friend had the vegan lasagna. He was upset about the lack of cheese (he forgot it was vegan) but he ate it up nonetheless. It has a powerful sea of tomatoes.  The price is not cheap but its not expensive either. Next step is a brunch which is my usual Siggy's go to meal. I also enjoy their smoothies in the summer.",

Loved all the tomato sauce it was covered in!The sweet potato side was amazing. You need to order it! Our waiter was really helpful and told us his favorites (really cute too )!  I think I'll try something a bit healthier next time since that's what I tend to order. Excited to try their whole menu! Love all the alien artwork inside.

I ordered the beet and orange salad and also had a few bites of my friend's Live Earth Salad that he had ordered with chicken. Both were great. Mine was a refreshing, light salad, while his was a heartier salad with a greater variety of fresh ingredients. I enjoyed his dressing much more than mine!  After finishing my salad, I was in the mood for a burger and decided to split the Wild Salmon Burger with my friend. I was expecting the patty to just be a grilled salmon fillet, but it was an actual patty made out of (ONLY - and they make sure to emphasize this) salmon meat. It was juicy and delicious! The burger disappeared in just a few minutes. I wish they offered different sides for the burgers instead of just a side of greens - having just eaten a plate of veggies, I would have really enjoyed some air baked fries or something like that to go along with my burger. :P   Service is extremely attentive, and it was overall a very pleasant dining experience. However, I found this place really pricey - even for organic food - which will be the one thing that deters me from returning more frequently!",

I went with my three adult daughters and grandson. We eat a plant based diet and were very happy with our sandwiches. I chose the Mediterranean which may have been wrong for me. I don't like olives and I missed that the bread was covered in an olive spread. But the tofu was delish! And the ciabatta bread was the best ever.

    "text": "Siggy's definitely does in fact serve *good food*, nothing to write home about or delicious enough to crave randomly, but certainly palatable. It's all GOOD but not particularly creative or unique. Also, vegans be warned: it is a vegan friendly place, but it's not the kind of place that makes a lot of non-vegan things vegan. There is no mac n \"cheeze\" or bbq \"chickun\" type stuff, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just real food being naturally vegan and not pretending to be something else like some weird imposter.   The best thing that Siggy's has to offer is that it has vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, and meat options, so it's good for any kind of group....in theory. The reason it isn't so group friendly in practice is that the music is always blaring. Like hardcore EDM type stuff. I couldn't tell if I was at a casual dinner or tryna rage (which I might've been down to do if I hadn't been trying to enjoy some vegan pasta and a nice glass of wine).   Even after asking the staff to turn it down, I still had to yell in order to hear my friends over the pumping tunes. I guess this is more of a place where you go with only one other person and sit on the same side of the booth next to each other (yuck) and whisper sweet nothings directly into your date/friend/acquaintance's ear. But if that's what you're looking for, head on over.  PS. If you order the chocolate chip cookie, you should know it is more accurately ginger cookie + chocolate chips. Good nonetheless.  PS to Siggy's: What is with your website? It makes me think that your restaurant is going to be a Chipotle-esque, uber-casual atmosphere with unflattering fluorescent lighting. I was pleasantly surprised to see some mood lighting and a cool atmosphere, but that website has got to go.",

When it comes to nutrition, most restaurants fall short somewhere in the cooking process, whether it's the marinade, the amount of butter used, or the temperature / duration of the cooking.  Thus there are very few restaurants that any certified dietician or nutritional scientist could strictly endorse.  But this restaurant is different.  It employs the right ingredients, proportions, and cooking techniques that promote optimal health.  In addition, Siggy's has just such variety:  Everything from a fine fillet of meat to fresh juices and smoothies, this place has you covered.  You also have endless possibilities in customizing your dishes with added ingredients!  Finally, the atmosphere is intimate, and the service is top-notch.",

A friend and I came for dinner on a Friday night, and were seated quickly; service was attentive.  I ordered the black bean wrap ($12.50), and my friend ordered the salmon burger ($12.50).  The menu featured myriad salads, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, and a whole page of smoothies and juices.  Both of our dishes were alright: the salmon burger had nice seasoning, and the vegan mayo was flavorful.  However, the burger was a bit on the smaller side compared to the brioche bun.  My black bean wrap was also good, but nothing amazing; the patty was lost in the tortilla and greens, and a little dry.  Overall, although we were satisfied with our experience, the value just wasn't there.  Maybe it's worth another shot, but for now, Siggy's Good Food was just good.",

The dish was so flavorful that all of those \"healthy vegan\" swaps went undetected. I'm fairly certain celery was involved, which seemed unusual to me, but I liked it.

If not, you will think it's OK but kinda overpriced for what you get.  A friend wanted to dine here so I figured I would give it a shot. I tried the Garden Veggie Sandwich which consists of Avocado, Cucumbers, Clover Sprouts, Carrots, Greens & Homemade Parsley Hummus. I also had them add some Tofu to make it a bit more filling.   The sandwich was decent but I kept feeling like I was missing something. Maybe a side of fries or a salad that consisted of more than a couple greens on the side of the plate. I found myself pulling the sandwich apart and trying to make it into a salad and half sandwich.   When the bill came (after tax and tip). I owed $17. For just a sandwich (no side, no drink, no lottery ticket haha).   So for me, I would much rather dine elsewhere. Nothing was wrong with the food and the wait staff was friendly, allowing me to give them 3 stars. But i would really advise only coming here if you believe it necessary to overspend on organic sandwiches and the like.",

We tried the Quinoa Spinach Cakes, the Wild Salmon Burger w/side salad, and the Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna - all were amazingly yummy and obviously made with fresh ingredients... Highly recommend!!!",

In Manhattan, it is truly a gem, and worth the trek across town for lunch.",

    "text": "This is a great lunch or dinner spot. I came with a group of 8 here my first time. I had the beef stew which was flavorful and delicious. My friend let me try some of her flank steak sandwich and I was amazed. I do not think of getting steak on a sandwich since I do not like bread. Even though the flank steak was well done rather than rare or medium rare which is how I prefer my steak, I really thought it was a great dish. I don't know if the steak was marinated or what gave it that flavor, but it worked with the greens, mushrooms and ciabatta bread. My other friends all enjoyed their foods as well. I ordered the flank steak sandwich the next time I came here with another friend and ate it with one side of the bread with a fork and knife. Again, I don't like too much bread so I didn't eat the other side of bread. This is not to say there wasn't enough meat; the portion size was good. This was the best steak sandwich I had.   They also have smoothies, juices, and hot soups. If I pass by and the restaurant isn't too crowded, I might get a smoothie or juice to go.   The food and drinks are organic. Well worth the price.",

The smoothies are also very good and when Siggy is around, she is very sweet. The art revolves and that is good cause for a while there it was kinda weird, I am quite glad the Master of Puppets and sexy Ronald McDonald aren't staring at me while I eat anymore. The service is hit and miss, if I had only been there once regarding my most recent trip this rating would be lower but since I'm a regular, I know what to expect from who.

It's pretty fine to find a health conscious organic restaurant that serves beer and wine, organic beer and wine in fact.  So far I've only tried the spelt macaroni and cheese, which is to die for.  Perfectly cheesey gooey-ness and the organic spelt elbow noodle carry the dish.  Excellent comfort food style meets healthy foodie considerations.

    "text": "When you're racking your brain for possible complaints about a restaurant and the only negative point you can muster is that your table had been wobbling irritatingly throughout your meal, you know the food must be good. My fiance and I arrived at Siggy's doorstep after a lengthy outing in the city that left us famished - hungry enough to ignore the strange and copious alien- and UFO-centric decor that might have been bizarre enough to cause us to pause on any other day. Even so, we ventured in bravely, led by our appetites and heartened by the enthusiastic reviews here on yelp. At around six-thirty on a Monday evening, many of the tables were already bustling and the friendly server had to lead us to a table toward the rear of the restaurant. While perusing the menu, we were given a plate of sandwich bread slices and olive oil to start, which seemed a little unconventional as they seemed like they were cold, untoasted, and seemed to have been pulled out of a bag of Arnold's bread. Still, each slice had generous flecks of sesame seeds, nuts, and oats throughout and we munched on them without complaint.   The menu is fairly short but even a perfunctory glance reveals Siggy's commitment to organic and sustainably sourced fare. For instance, all of the piscatorial dishes clearly make mention of wild caught fish, allowing my fiance to place a guilt-free order of a salmon burger. As an added plus, the patties are made without fillers, which meant that each bite guaranteed nothing but a mouthful of fresh, flaky fish. Burgers here can be ordered with the traditional bun, a gluten-free bun (for an added charge), or atop a generous bed of mixed greens, with a small cup of dressing on the side. My fiance went with the latter and his side of the table went completely silent after his entree arrived at the table, save the occasional sounds of pleasant masticating. As for my own order, I surprised both of us by choosing the noodle-less eggplant lasagna. Noodles are, in my well-vocalized opinion, the backbone of a good pasta dish, and my longstanding dislike of eggplant is equally well-known, so by all rhyme and reason, I should have hated this dish.   I not only liked it; I INHALED it.   In fact, my fiance had to forcibly wrench the dish away from me when I began to lick the plate clean. The steaming, tall tower of lasagna, comprised of many layers of eggplant and vegan ricotta, arrived in an ample pool of red sauce. Though without a hint of dairy cheese, the tofu was cleverly dressed to create a creamy mouth-tribute to the real deal. From start to finish, we enjoyed our meal here and would definitely return for more!",

I'm a super picky vegetarian and there was plenty for me to choose from.  I had the veggie black bean burger, which was a bit spicy.  It definitely needed some avocado,  but that's about the only thing I could imagine making the burger better.    Everyone else had breakfast food, and everyone polished off their dishes.   The staff was extremely nice and accommodating.  Now I know why my brother and S-i-L are regulars!  I would be too if I lived closer!    Oh, and the raspberry bars, which I grabbed to go, was as fresh and delicious as the rest of the food.  BE BACK SOON!",

One of the better gluten free buns around, doesn't fall apart, great \"normal\" breadiness.  Had the side of garlic kale -- delicious. Perfectly salty and flavorful for my liking in sauteed greens.   And lastly -- shared the gluten free/vegan brownie a la mode with Coconut Bliss vegan ice cream on top.  Daamnnnn....  The menu offers a delightful plethora of almond milk smoothies and vegan salads and gluten free cookies and coffee and a tasty brunch on weekends.   Siggy's is not just \"doable\" as in merely allergen-friendly -- the food is excellent!",

Siggy's didn't look that promising from the exterior, but once you walk in, it's a cheerful, comfortable space staffed by an incredibly friendly group of folks. The menu is mostly \"health\" food - there's a fair amount of veggie and vegan food, though Siggy's also serves (healthy) burgers, turkey burgers, chicken noodle soup, and the like.  If you're headed there for lunch, I'd recommend the 1/2 sandwich and soup - go with the lentil garlic soup (there's no salt on the table, perhaps my only critique of the place, and the soup could certainly use a dash) and the 1/2 veggie sandwich (which will show you all of the magnificent things one can do with a bunch of fresh veggies and some really good bread. And, if you're feeling sick (or tired, or vitamin deprived), check out the ample selection of smoothies, all of which can be enhanced with vitamins and herbs.",

Let's start with the food: I usually get the salmon burger w/ a side of roasted potatoes. This is my go-to dish whenever I come to siggy's because its delicious, and the ingredients are quality. For brunch, I love their breakfast burrito and buckwheat pancakes! They also have really good coffee and smoothies which was tasty and refreshing.  Prices: A bit pricey but totally worth it for the quality and freshness of their ingredients.  Staff: The guys and gals working here are really friendly, down-to-earth, and accommodating. Attentive but not overly so.  Atmosphere: I love the atmosphere. It's calm and relaxing-- a place where you can actually have a conversation.  Can't wait to come back and try their pastas, appetizers, and soups!",

Even on the foulest days of this past winter, I braved the elements just to have a bite of the best food on the Lower East Side. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the staff is great, and they do takeaway/delivery. Also amazing: the menu is perfect for those with dietary restrictions/preferences, with a solid number of dishes being vegan and/or gluten-free.   Things you should definitely try: the salmon burger (SO GOOD), roasted sweet potatoes (MUST-HAVE), and my personal favorite, the olive oil, garlic, and artichoke pasta (GLUTEN-FREE AND VEGAN)(ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR).   I brought my brother here a little while ago for lunch, and he was skeptical at first.   \"This place looks really crunchy,\" he said as he browsed the menu. \"It's all so...organic.\"   But that's what's so amazing about this place. You forget about how good the food is for you. You just relish how good the food is, period.   One bite into the artichoke pasta and his eyes started misting over. \"I had no idea food could taste like this,\" he said. \"It's beautiful.\"  Couldn't have said it better myself.",

The only thing I care to note is that the kale salad side ($6) was more like a cabbage salad as it was all cabbage and maybe 5-10% kale. For the price that's kind of not fair. I would suggest at least changing the name. But it was still yummy and was a great compliment to my steak sandwich.  Overall, happy.",

After driving around a random area mislabeled \"Plaza Midwood\", I arrived at Siggy's. It was an unassuming storefront on a quiet, dark street corner that screamed gentrification.   Siggy's is the Bernie Sanders of Charlotte cafes. The menu is salads, smoothies/juices and sandwiches. Vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore... you are all safe here. However, I would mostly recommend Siggy's to those who ate that one extra slice of pizza last night and are seeking atonement. Siggy's will cleanse your mind, body and spirit with free love and quinoa.  I ordered the popular Greek avocado/quinoa salad with turkey ($15). It was massive and really quite tasty. Another bonus - they sell wine and beer, so go ahead and drink away your sorrows.  We all need you Siggy's. Thanks for being here, and making me feel a little less guilty about my Bojangles obsession.",

    "text": "I've had Siggy's bookmarked for quite some time and today seemed like the day to give them a try. The ambiance was nice and the waiter and juice bar host were friendly, but the stars are lacking here for the food.   I ordered the black bean veggie burger and switched out the wrap for a GF bun. I wish I hadn't or had been swayed otherwise because the bun couldn't house the burger and it crumbled after the first bite. The bun also soaked up all of the mayo and pesto, so it was pretty dry. I ended up picking away at it with my fork and eating it as a salad.   I wanted to go the beer route, but at 7 bucks for a Samuel Smith (no HH prices) I decided to put that towards something healthy and the Coco Peanut Brain seemed like a good route. It wasn't my favourite and the cacao nibs make for a gritty smoothie.   Overall spent 24 bucks (GF bun costs an extra dollar on an already pricey $13.50 wrap) before tip on a pretty mediocre and unfulfilling meal. The hype seems to be over the salmon burger and beef stew. Not so much for the vegan options.",

    "text": "My husband and I popped into Siggy's for a takeout sandwich and salad. We wanted to stay and dine but simply couldn't swing it this particular day.  We had peeked at the menu the previous day and it just looked really delicious.  We parked on a side street but there were a handful of spots in the back. There is also an outside patio where you can eat.  It's airy and bright in there with a cooler of a good selection of juices, natural sodas and kombucha. There is also a fresh juice menu with full cups of juice or juice shots. The 'Flu Shot' is a great pick me up; greens, lemon, echinacea, ginger and cayenne. Stir it or the pepper might settle! Super flavorful.  Note that they use organic ingredients. Also, they offer beer and wine.  Food wise we went with the Italian Smoked Turkey Sub on ciabatta. This has smoked deli turkey, red roasted peppers, Swiss, greens and olive tapenade. Again, wow flavor packed and so fresh! Then we paired this with the 'Raw Slaw'; shaved green cabbage, carrots and kale and loaded with sesame seeds accompanied with lots of lemony olive oil vinaigrette. We actually got such a generous portion we saved some to go with dinner.  You can add many customizations like boiled eggs and tofu and the list goes on.  I'm very thrilled to have Siggy's close by and look forward to dining in.",

The basil pesto, vegan mayo and tomato cilantro salsa added so much flavor to the wrap. While I enjoyed it, I thought it was overpriced, $13.50 for a wrap?  - Veggies and tofu Mediterranean sub on ciabatta bread $13.50 - the kalamata olive paste and olive oil gave the sub a complex taste. While I thought it was just ok, my friend preferred this over the wrap.",

I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night with a friend and was able to be seated right away.  We started with an order of the hummus and split orders of the beef stew and salmon.  The hummus was delicious and was a good sized portion as well. If there's hummus on the menu, I order it--and this was one of the better ones I had. It's a bit of a bummer they don't have pita, but the ciabatta is pretty good as well.  The main meals were also very good. The salmon was cooked absolutely perfectly and was super flavorful. I also got it with sides of sweet potatoes and broccoli that was cooked simply, but had great flavor.  The beef stew was also a good sized portion and was very tasty. The meat was very tender and mixed well with the brown rice and kale.  Overall, this place serves up some excellent dishes that skew towards the healthy side and come out quickly. The service was friendly and attentive. The only major downside for me are that the dishes are a bit on the pricey side--around $25 each--and the seating arrangements aren't always the most comfortable, but that definitely shouldn't stop you from checking this place out.",

I was hoping to see more plant based options like they offered in NY. Maybe they're waiting for the demand? I ordered a side cabbage kale salad and Mediterranean tofu sandwich. For the $5 side salad, it was just cabbage, kale and sesame seeds. Maybe some carrots or cucumbers or something would make the $5 easier to swallow. The sandwich had a great blend of flavors and I would recommend it.   I appreciate the cardboard to-go containers (yea, no styrofoam!) but I hope they can also switch to biodegradable utensils and/or not give me one unless I ask.   I look forward to the evolution of Siggy's and will try them again.",

While not technically a vegetarian, I realize the need for a healthier diet versus one that isn't so good for the body, etc.  Plus I do like my veggies, but very much appreciate something more than a salad, a juice, or a sauteed mix. The hubby who was with me wasn't so keen for an all Vegan place to eat...  I saw the earlier reviews and am grateful to have stopped by.  Delicious, simply delicious.  I had the Eggplant, tofu ricotta lasagna.  My husband had the Chicken Mediterranean dish with brown rice and brocolli.  He inhaled his (not his style normally) and I was in good taste heaven.

The owners try to hide the B on the door by keeping the door open. We only noticed the rating after we had sat down and ordered. They also try to justify the B rating by a few silly lines printed out below it which don't make any sense at all; something about sticking it to the man, when realistically they need to improve on their infraction received from the inspectors. Anyways the food is mediocre in taste, we came here for the gluten free options, had the burger with potatoes side (one for me and one for my guest) and a salad as an appetizer. Everything was just okay. Bill came out to $55, WAY overpriced for quality of food and taste. Shortly after, within an hour, both my guests and my stomach were very upset. Plain and simple this place is expensive, has a questionable food health rating, and causes stomach issues. 100% avoid and don't be deceived by their positive reviews.",

Not many raw options besides the smoothies and juices that I've seen yet, but I could have overlooked. As a gluten-free vegan with only leanings towards raw at this point, I found many great options to eat for when I'm in the mood for a warm cooked meal, and I can rest assured that their guarantee is that they cook everything from scratch with whole, pure ingredients. Most of the staff seems very friendly and helpful (the two guys I dealt with when ordering out at the front counter were great) and the atmosphere is generally nice.   I've been there both on warm days, once mother's day and then again today, it was pretty warm and humid on both days and they didn't seem to have any sort of cooling systems to help allay the uncomfortable warmth which is a real nuisance to those who hate warm weather like I do. The bathroom the first time I had been in there had just been cleaned, and I get it, it's nyc, you want to slather that disinfectant on those surfaces, but it was so strong that being in the bathroom for less than 4 minutes, I got seriously lightheaded and my eyes started to tear. The smell of whatever they used in their cleaning products was intense.  But the food and the service is what matters to me most, and this place seems to meet the mark and know what it's doing.",

    "text": "Although I am not GF, my girlfriend is... and this place made her dining experience quite difficult because she was overwhelmed by how many options there were.  We started off with some GF bread, which is a rarity at many places.  Eventually she settled on the live earth salad and added beets, which came to us with a great portion size and a good ratio of greens to toppings.  I ordered the Shaka-Shu-Ka, one of my first times ever having the dish and I would definitely get it again. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the portion size was big enough to fill me even after I entered the restaurant painfully hungry.  The eclectic vibe matches the options on the menu, and I will definitely be adding this to my list of places to go more often.",

    "text": "This location only a few months old and a well hidden secret. On a Friday night, it was full but not packed.   After a nice yoga workout, we were all hungry and consulted Yelp. Once again, Yelp came through and saved the day!  One of us is vegan and the other is gluten-free, so this place worked for all of us.   I tried the 3-bean, butternut squash soup. Very hearty and perfect for the cold Fall day!  I also had the SWEET POTATO CAKES and they were \"ridiculous.\" That's what the waiter said when I asked if they were good and indeed, he was right.   I also had an organic IPA and it hit the spot...AAHHH.   For dessert, we shared a vegan, gluten-free walnut brownie a la mode with a scoop of coconut milk vanilla ice cream. Heavenly divine and a perfect way to end a beautiful day!   And if that weren't enough, I went to the bathroom after dinner and found this AMAZING QUOTE by Martha Graham:  \"There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost.\"  I'll definitely be back to try more yummy food and also to see live bands play here!",

Today long haired flannel guy (manager) walked away from my complaint instead of simply saying \"sorry\". A corporate place would treat one better, but someone actually personally owns this place. Another time a dark haired girl running the juice bar was cold and offered no solution to a simple problem. Simple problems handled poorly: - ground up pits in $9 smoothly (couldn't consume, girl could have offered a new one).  - kitchen employee cut my waiting in line for bathroom for his own use. Saw me and everything (Customer 1st..? Apology would have helped).  Take responsibility and communicate Siggy management!",

The food is super fresh, organic, delicious and there's plenty for omnivores including lots of vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free options (my favorite is the eggplant lasagna and the wild salmon burger is a popular choice).  The owner Siggy is a wonderful woman who cares about quality ingredients using organic & non-GMO food.  service is always friendly and efficient without being intrusive. So reasonably priced too.. entrees range from $10-$22.   Perfect for a date, business lunch or birthday dinner. Siggy's is cozy and unpretentious. What more could you want?   oh yeah...

    "text": "The name of this restaurant should come with a spoiler alert because guess what fam? Siggy's does have some good @ss food! I walked in with my arms folded like \"Siggy's Good Food? I'll be the judge of that!\"   I had some preconceived notions that organic food normally meant you had to sacrifice on tastes and pay way more money for your meal. So I was prepared to be let down like Giants fans any time Eli Manning is in the 2 minute drill.   I was immediately struck by the confidence of the man behind the register. He looked even more eager than we were for us to try his food. He was so excited it made me feel like it must've put his foot in these sandwiches!  The menu is really simple but has a lot of variety. I got the smoked turkey sub (as a gluten free wrap) and some roasted zucchini. They were both delicious! My wife had the local beef kabobs sandwich and it was also scrumptious. And I had a \"Hint of Lime\" water which was a new experience for me. It was also great.  The staff was friendly and attentive. The environment was clean with plenty of cozy seating.   It was all filling and yummy. I'll definitely return when I can. They're sort of on the other side of town from me and they're only open until 5pm so I'll definitely return when I have a day off.  I also saw a friend I play basketball with walking out of the restaurant as I was coming in. And him and his wife were like \"Oh you're trying Siggy's! You're gonna love it!\" It's like the universe wanted me to eat a Siggy's.   The friends name is Buddy and he had to stop playing basketball at lunch because he got a good job uptown. I almost didn't recognize him because his wife was beautiful and I said there's no way Buddy got game like that! But guess what? Buddy got game fam.  Anyways we don't play ball together any more but he was a cool guy. The lesson here is that people are put into your life for a reason and you don't always know what it is right away. I like the to think that the reason Buddy was put in my life was to solidify my choice to try Siggy's Good Food.",

It's fast casual and there were tables available and no line to order.   We went with the steak sandwich and the beef kabob sandwich. Both were amazing. The bread and sauce really took the sandwich to the next level. I think I liked the beef kabob one a little more, but it's hard to pick. Definitely my favorite sandwiches in Charlotte.   We added a side of beets which were very good and all of the crostinis except the tuna one. The brie and fig was our favorite, but we liked them all. The only thing we probably wouldn't get again was the banana almond butter smoothie. It was ok, but not nearly as good as the rest.   I would highly recommend checking this place out for a quick, delicious meal!",

And we expect this may become one of our new regular spots. :)  The first time we came after having barbecue next door and just had a glass of wine (mine) and a beer (his). The atmosphere is cozy and semi romantic in the evening. It was a nice spot to extend our dinner experience with an after dinner drink and some bonus relaxation.  Yesterday morning we came back for their brunch. (Open at 10:30am on Sundays.) We both got the vegetable frittata, which was delicious and came with a side salad and a few toasted slices of their baguette. It was delicious and filling but not too heavy. The ingredients are all fresh and the meals are made in house (no microwave). The only thing I would have changed about my order is asked for the dressing on the side, but my husband was fine with his dressing amount. So it was definitely a personal preference, not a fault of the place.  I also picked up a \"flu shot\" juice on my way out. Totally medicinal in flavor, but I was told by the staff to expect that.  I definitely want to come back one day after a killer workout to try the cocoa peanut butter banana smoothie. It sounds delicious!  This is definitely a great contribution to the neighborhood. And we plan to support with our continued patronage. :)",

You can see food being prepared and often chat with Siggy who is working the kitchen, greeting customers and keeping an eye onthe dining room.    The food is incredibly fresh and tasty.  The service is good - you order at the counter and it's brought out to you when ready.  I'd love to see table service - at least for ordering additional drinks.    My only hesitation about Siggy's is the price.  My husband and I dropped in for brunch - we had a salad with protein, a fritatta and 2 mimosas -- total -- and spent about $60.  That was the second time we visited, and the 2nd time there was a bit of sticker shock. I'm happy to pay for good food - but the pricing here feels a bit high.",

Parking is behind the restaurant or on the street and when you come in, seat yourself and go up to the register when ready to order! The atmosphere is very chill and the staff are so sweet! Now, the food. I ordered the veggie sandwich, added tofu and the cabbage and kale slaw and how flavorful it all was! The ciabatta bread was so fresh.  I also had a brownie for dessert and the turmeric chips they have with other chips and snacks that you can buy.  I tried the strawberry coconut passionflower Kefir soda and that was refreshingly delicious as well! I think I found a new lunch spot!",

I have to say, I was a bit surprised how high the prices were for how the food was being described, but after I got my meal, I was overwhelmed both by the size of my sandwich, the flavors, and the obvious clean and fresh way of preparation, all justifying the cost. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They made you feel like a regular, even if your first time, and you have the feeling you can't wait to go back and see them.  There is a patio, but being winter we didn't get to sit outside. Inside was plenty comfortable.   Parking is a major issue! Their lot is crazy tiny, but there is some street parking available.",

I got to try to Crostinis Plate with 3 of their options: Ricotta with Za'atar, Brie with Fig Paste and Almonds, and the Ricotta with Nova Lox and Capers. All three were really good but my favorite would probably have to be Brie with Fig Paste. It just had the best combination of flavor to me. I also had the Quinoa Grain which was pretty good as a nice light side as well. I would love to come back and try some of their other options as well.",

    "text": "What a fun, spirited little lunch spot.  The neighborhood and vibe of the space caused me to feel hip immediately.  The decor is interesting.  I usually don't like restaurants that make me order at the counter, but this one was fine. The engaging lady at the counter insisted that we take the menus to our table to study them prior to coming back up to place our orders.  I selected the Mediterranean vegetable salad on greens with tofu.  Okay, it was like the best tofu ever.  The vegetables and the salad dressing were divine.   Check out my photo of it.  I also had a crostini topped with brie and fig and drizzled with olive oil.  It also was a wow!   Although the menu is not a mile long, they do a superb job with the items that they DO offer. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea.  Yes, I took it up with the owner, who apparently came here from the north, and I tried to impress upon her that she is operating a restaurant in the SOUTH, and down here, we need tea running thru our veins just to make everything work properly.  She understands that there are no shortcuts to brewing good iced tea and promised me that she would consider making it.  The lack of tea, is the only reason I didn't give them a 5 rating. They are doing good stuff here and you should go soak in the entire experience!  Let me know what you think.",

I did the chicken and steak sandwiches and I was blown away. Owner and Chef Siggy does a great job of incorporating Latin flavors into his food.   Vibe: Think Roots Cafe meets Max and Lola's bodega. You can take food and drink to go or eat there. They also sell coffee and smoothies. It's also nestled in a booming part of Plaza near Catawba and Sweet Lous BBQ. A must try local spot in Charlotte.",

It was very good and a nice portion.  The only sightly odd thing about it, hence four stars, is the tofu was brined in what seemed to be soy sauce.  Not something I associate with the Mediterranean.  I think  balsamic vinegar with olive oil and some basil would be more on target.  I do plan to go back there and try some other items.  It should be noted that there is road construction on Belmont road in the area and you might have to drive around that to get there. At least I did on 12- 12-18.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place that just had its grand opening today (9/4/18). We decided to check it out after coming back from being out of town and needing some good food after a long flight home.   Pros: - The space has been nicely updated and had an overall inviting atmosphere with nice music playing  - The sandwich we split (Grass-fed Steak on Ciabatta Hero) was very tasty and a good size   Cons: - The service was a little underwhelming, especially since it was a grand opening. We were clearly a little lost looking at the menu and had to solicit guidance. It would've been nice to have an explanation of who they are and why they're there. Ordering the \"hoagie\", we were told that wasn't an option, they had ciabatta (which was listed as \"ciabatta hoagie\") - There is very limited parking (I.e. 3 spots + 1 handicap spot). I love walking everywhere, but this is a bit of a haul from home (Elizabeth) and it is tough to have very little on-street and lot parking  - Tiniest water cups ever. They maybe hold 4 oz. Maybe. When you order a sandwich, having a full-size non-expensive bottle option would be nice.   They clearly had a following in NYC (4.5-star on Yelp) before moving here, but this is a different market, so you might need to educate us locals as to why you earned such high praise.   With a lot of good places already nearby (though not in Belmont) both new and established, will probably wait a while before giving Siggy's another go.",

I had never heard of the place before, and it's located in an odd neighborhood with very limited parking.   But I actually was pleasantly surprised. They've got loads of kombucha choices from Lenny Boy in a cooler, their own handmade juices, and a small (though tasty) menu. I had the grilled cheese with apples and fig jam and thought it was delicious. It's counter-style ordering, but everyone was really pleasant.

I said I'd order a $100 bottle of wine, but was told that this was \"a matter of principle.\" So on principle they would have a customer stand awkwardly at the entrance with his drink, rather than let him sit at the empty table where he'd soon have dinner. I had been there several times before. The food is good but mass produced and certainly not worth standing for, next to an empty table, I left without ordering a drink or dinner. A few minutes later, my friend and I were enjoying a drink and dinner a few blocks away. This is not exactly a good strategy for making people feel welcome in a restaurant or developing a loyal following.",

    "text": "I've been there several times and they always have amazing food!  As a longtime vegan, I don't often love non-vegetarian restaurants, but this place gets my vote.  The vegiburger is exceptional (no soy nor gluten and a delicious, unique taste).  GF/brown rice pasta bowl was outstanding, too.  Juice bar is very good.  Great service - the staff are really friendly even if you're getting takeout or not spending a lot of money there.  The \"alien\" theme to the decor is cheesy but fun. But the main reason they get 5 stars is that nearly everything is organic!  It's pathetic how many vegetarian or \"healthy\" restaurants don't offer any organic food.  My only complaint is that many of the shakes come with soy protein...let's hope they upgrade to Sun Warrior or Vega One.   If you're a meat-lover and not sure where to take a vegetarian or vegan friend for lunch, or a vegan who wants to take a meat-eating friend to dinner, Siggy's could be a good option.",

My main gripe was with the food - my boyfriend and I just got the organic burgers, and I know that's probably not what they specialize in.  However, it was the oddest spiced burger I've ever had.   It definitely tasted of curry and cumin and various other Indian spices.   The heavy spice was so off-putting, we could barely get through half of the burger.  Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food - I guess I just didn't like this weird tangy spicy combination in the burger. It was just completely unexpected.   However, the people next to me ordered some sort of pasta dish, and it looked absolutely fantastic.  We probably just ordered the wrong thing.",

The front got really crowded, this is a popular spot for the after-gym crowd to swing by for a fruit shake.  I skipped on appetizers, but tried a fruit juice (orange,apple,beet and banana). It was very sweet and tasty, everyone with me concurred!   I ordered the King Salmon dinner special (medium) which came with black rice and a salad. The Salmon was well marinated, although a bit on the smaller side. The sides were quite delectable.   Minus one star because our waiter, while nice did not check on us that often and we had to flag down the host to get our check for us.

Their menu items use organic, locally-sourced ingredients and are catered to omnivores, vegetarians, vegans, and even gluten-free folks.  2. Large paintings hang on the interior walls, but there is also an alien theme here--the tip jar is decorated with a green alien face and the chalkboard sign outside reads \"Aliens Eat For Free.\" That's pretty funny.   There's a juice bar and take-out \"counter\" up front and plenty of tables and seats. For a 1:30pm lunch, there were a good number of empty seats.   The turkey burger was something else. I've had my share of flavorful turkey burgers, but they've often been flavorful because of a sauce; this turkey burger actually had herbs and seasonings packed into the thick patty. It came with a side of ketchup, but it was unnecessary. The soft brioche buns soaked up the juices of the patty well.  My friends also enjoyed their salmon burgers and flank steak sandwiches.  Likelihood of another visit: I'm definitely coming back here again. I've actually heard good things about the gluten-free stuff here! Their No Noodle Lasagna with tofu ricotta and their Beef Ragu Pasta Bowl with gluten-free brown rice penne both sound great.",

I didn't taste the beef burger, but I thought the steak sandwich was delicious. The meat was flavorful, tender, and juicy. Unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan of the salmon burger. It tasted more of chickpeas than salmon, but the texture was pleasantly compact, rather than flaky and crumbly. All the plates had a lot of arugula in and around the sandwiches, but they were a nice compliment to the burgers. For the price, location, and service, I would come back.

Everyone agreed that the meals were hearty, healthy and yummy. The quinoa burger did break apart easily but it's the taste that matters no?  After finishing our meal we stayed talking for at least 45 more minutes and never felt pressured to leave, instead they brought out a new glass water bottle for us to drink!

The menu is simple, mostly lunch-oriented stuff and they also offer smoothies and baked goods to go.   My hubby and I are vegan and brought a couple of meat-eater friends along for lunch this weekend and everyone was generally satisfied, but not necessarily blown away. Why, you ask?  Well, the service was okay, but a bit anemic. Everyone seemed to be waiting to wrap up their day and go home; no one was rude or anything drastic, but the servers seemed kind of...bored. Not a big deal though, especially if you go places for the food, like we do.  While I enjoyed my black bean burger, I was a bit confused by the strange lack of a vegan bun. This place has tons of vegan options, attracts many vegan folk and boasts awesome burgers--doesn't it only make sense to stock a vegan buns? I guess not! Even the gluten free option wasn't vegan. I ended up getting my burger on multigrain toast, which tasted great but fell apart very easily since toast is not meant to uphold a huge burger patty.  Everyone else was pretty satisfied with what they got and this is a nice, fast convenient place to grab a bite, but a few small details take away that extra star.",

While I waited for my food, the juicer, Ahtmose, made me a couple samples of fresh squeezed orange juice and ginger lemonade (which I ended up ordering).  I ordered a cup of Lentil Garlic soup, which was also delicious. It went great with the fresh bread they serve.  I also tried their Quinoa Spinach Cakes topped with cilantro salsa which are bursting with flavor. Very creative dish.   I wish I were an alien because apparently they eat free at Siggy's.

Its casual setting and quirky decor make it a comfortable place for catching up, although you may find yourself backing into the person behind you if you're seated along the wall. Service is very friendly, and nobody will hover or rush you out after you set down your fork.  I ordered from the daily specials menu and chose the wild king salmon crusted with artichokes and olives. It was cooked medium (I wouldn't recommend cooking any longer) and both moist and flavorful, and it came with a generous side of black rice. The kohlrabi tomato salad on the plate was a nice touch but a bit too vinegary.  Overall a pretty good dinner and the perfect option if you're eating with vegan friends.",

We had to be somewhere else at a certain time, so my friend had to eat quickly and didn't even to get enjoy his burger or finish his meal.  After all of this, we thought Siggy's would have at least not put the burger on the bill or at the very least comped our drinks, but nope, nada.  To make matters worse, we had to be somewhere else by a certain time and we would have been fine on time had they gotten the order right but the multiple screwups made us late which ended up costing us an extra $30.",

This restaurant appears to be one of many that unethically passes off farmed Atlantic salmon as \"wild\".   Walking in here with wild salmon on our minds, my wife and I decided to get the wild king salmon dinner, with a tomato sauce and a side of beans and black rice, rather than the wild salmon burger everyone raves out. We also ordered the raw slaw salad with kale and cabbage as a side. We asked our waiter (who reminded me of Jack Black) whether the salmon was wild Alaskan salmon or from elsewhere in the Pacific. He wasn't sure but promised to find out.   The food came and we ate it, but strangely enough, the salmon did not have the rich red color characteristic of a wild caught fish. Nor was it as rich and buttery as I had expected. It wasn't until after our meal that our server came back to us with \"I don't know the location, but it's from the Atlantic.\"   Huge red flag! This was clearly not not wild caught salmon. Wild Atlantic salmon is virtually extinct to the point where it is illegal to catch it commercially, so all wild caught salmon comes from either the Pacific or Europe (highly unlikely given the price point). Maybe the restaurant was confused about the origins of a dish highlighted prominently on its menu? More likely this place was just passing off farmed Atlantic salmon as \"wild\" knowing the foodie craze for it. Unethical, misleading, and for $22, overpriced.  My quest for real wild caught salmon continues...",

Having an autoimmune disease, many dietary restrictions, and tons of food allergies, it is extremely hard to find a place that can accommodate my needs. I never have to worry about hidden ingredients, preservatives, or GMO's when dining here. Their dishes, juices, smoothies (basically everything) is delicious. If I'm there for lunch, I usually order the salmon burger on top of greens instead of the bun (I'm gluten-free) or if I'm there for dinner, I'll order the salmon dinner with sweet potatoes and kale. I can't say enough good things about this place. The staff were very sweet and helpful and made sure they notified the manager and kitchen of my allergies and concerns. My boyfriend and friends who aren't as crazy as a health freak as me, also loved the place. Thank you Siggy's!",

The quinoa avocado salad is my favorite, but the burger and turkey club is good, as well. Great for vegans and vegetarians. Siggy's is always busy, but never overly packed. Like I said, perfect lunch options! They offer a good special too for half soup/ salad and sandwich. Smoothies are amazing!! Love this place.",

I went with someone who is a big meat eater and doesn't feel satisfied unless meat is in the meal. Even he liked the lasagna and said that you couldn't even tell there was no meat and was vegan! Delicious and nutritious food is what I look for and this place is both.  The staff was friendly and it was a very comfortable atmosphere. I will definitely try to return in the future!",

The other person got the black bean burger and it was equally mush with no flavor. We also got a lentil soup which did not have any flavors or spice. The sauces all say garlic but there was no garlic flavor on any of the meals. Stay away.",

My non-Gluten Free friends said their burgers were some of the best they've had in a long time and the salads and other options were just as wonderful.  I had the Herb Beef Stew, Gluten Free, and wow... I went back twice because it was so good!  Vegan options, fresh farm-to-table style food, and Gluten Free support... almost everything a sensitive foodie could want.  Unfortunately Siggy's hours of operation mean I can't often eat here but I always try and make it here once per trip to New York (from San Diego).  The fireplace in the back made for a great place to hide from the cold and snow during last year's Super Bowl week!",

I had the Chicken Almond Coconut Chicken Milanese and a Spa Skin Secret smoothie. Wow! how many people can say they had a spa skin treatment while dining?!  The chicken could've been more tender and juicy. I asked if they had some type of gravy that I could put over it because I like my food sitting in gravy baby. I actually ordered that dish in the first place because my super friendly waitress mentioned the great sauce that the dish came with served with brown rice and a veggie salad.    Okay, so now on to the Spa Skin Secret smoothie...this flavorful delight contains mango, pineapple, honey, yogurt, coconut milk and Vitamin C. Additionally, I added Echinacea to boost my immunity since we are entering the cold season. After dining, I just felt GOOD. No stomach bloating at all. After trying a Bikram Yoga class earlier that week it was great to treat my body and skin to something nourishing. I'm giving this place four stars because I believe that they have better tasting dishes on the menu that I look forward to trying next time. I will return to this place for sure.",

I was looking for a nice, chill spot to celebrate my sister's birthday that had to have good vegan options (she's a vegan). Found this place and called to see if the accept reservations (they do) and they were super friendly. They were incredibly accommodating when I asked if I could get some dessert brought out at the end of the meal- they brought together most of the staff out to sing happy birthday (really sweet! and the other diners were really cool too and joined in. Nice atmosphere).   The food was REALLY good (and Im not vegan). Had the Raw Almond shake (sweet enough and delicious), black bean sweet potato cakes were great as well, veggie burger was solid, and the lasagna was savory and perfectly balanced. Huge portions too (get what you pay for!) Vegan ice cream and brownie was delicious, too.   I HIGHLY recommend it!",

While I savor my quinoa salad almost every Friday, my coworkers get other things from the menu which they love. But the quinoa salad really is something special.   And, though it's my favorite takeout, the dine-in experience is quite nice as well. It's one of those cool, relaxed, laid back places where you can have a mellow lunch and not feel like there's a minimum level of cool you need to achieve.   I love this place.",

I have been a very frequent diner for 2 years, I love the food and I love the staff.  Last night, when asking to make a food substitution, I was told that the Owner, Siggy herself, was in the kitchen and would not allow it (a first in 2 years).  Willing to pay for the dietary substitution on the side, I simply wanted to speak with Siggy to understand if this was a new policy I should always expect in the future, or just when it was inordinately busy.   Siggy came out of the kitchen, guns blazing.  Without even allowing me to ask the question, she proceeded to yell, berate, and humiliate our table, claiming that we had no idea what running a restaurant out of a small kitchen was like and how inappropriate it was to expect special treatment at peak hours...   Very sad that I will no longer be able to support the staff, or recommend the restaurant... I just can't bring myself to give my money to a proprietor, so completely unprofessional, abusive, and unstable.",

They have interesting twists on classics, such as vegan lasagna without the actual pasta, and salmon burgers. The quinoa spinach cakes were too crumbly for my liking, but the grilled artichokes were really tasty. My lasagna was smothered in tomato sauce and it was full of vegetable goodness. They have beer, wine, juices, and smoothies as well. The location is a few steps away from the Broadway-Lafayette stop, and a few blocks from the F-2nd Ave. There is plenty of seating inside, although you may have to wait a short while during the more busy times. My waiter was really nice and made good recommendations. Waters were constantly refilled, and he came to check up on our table pretty often.",

I liked it a lot, but definitely can do away with less oil.  We also ordered sides of sauteed Kale and sauteed Broccoli.  I cleaned out both dishes!!!

I had the NO NOODLES Lasagna and it was soo good. I'm glad they serve it with all the sauce because I definitely ate it all up.   TIP: We sat at the bar - which I would NOT recommend because the seats are super uncomfortable. If you are dining, get a table. However, we got to see all the dishes as they came out and the salmon and wild rice dish looked amazing.   I'm definitely coming back to try their other dishes and will update this review.  Healthy and delicious meals. Prices were reasonable too.",

I don't know if I made bad choices or simply the food was not that good.  Usual dishes with usual tastes. Nothing fancy nothing out of the box. They have vegan and vegetarian options but it feels to me when restaurants think vegan/vegetarian they run out of ideas and creativity and many times even they forget about seasoning.  Anyway I don't think this would be an option to eat in a regular setting. Good for a lunch break in the area but not to go specially to have a meal here.",

I also value that their food is 100% organic and sustainable, which rationalizes a slightly higher price point. My favs are the No Noodles lasagna and the black bean burger wrap with added avocado, and the herb roasted potatoes. My coworkers like the flank steak sandwich. I have been concerned about their B health grade rating, which is why I give them 4 stars and not 5, but I've relaxed about it after reading the inspection results that the two violations were not critical.",

And I left with a bomb smoothie (mango, blueberry, banana, oj, coconut water, and almond butter), holy cow, though it's heft is a meal in itself.

It's a rather cute cafe, ever-so-slightly \"Siggy\"-themed.  Siggy is an alien I believe, presumably one into health foods?   Our server was prompt, cheerful, and just plain delightful.  Feeling guilty about not consuming the food pyramid's recommended daily intake of veggies in the last couple of days (and more so feeling it with each lethargic step), I shared a Splendid raw slaw with sesame kale & cabbage with my friend and I ordered the Sambazone acai (to go, so I could slowly sip it, but the server forgot) for my drinkable fruit fix.  Now I love me some acai berries in that I more or less gulped then down daily during a couple of weeks of study abroad in Brazil.  The Sambazone acai smoothie didn't quite evoke pleasant memories of being a student, on the beach, without a care in the world, but it was pretty tootin' good and refreshing.  The salad daunted us with its ample volume, but it wasn't terribly filling, in spite of its intensely fibrous components.  The citrusy vinaigrette nicely pared with the dense bursts of sesame seeds and we polished off the plate, temporarily feeling better about our dietary choices at least with regards to this meal.   As you can probably gather, I rather enjoyed my Siggy's lunch.  Great spot for vegetarians and their omnivore friends - there's chicken and fish options.",

Went with the eggplant & tofu lasagna (vegan) and a side of roasted herb sweet potatoes. It was the PERFECT comfort food combo on that dreary NYC day. The non-noodle lasagna was sooo good with layers of eggplant, tofu ricotta, veggies... all smothered in garlic tomato sauce. YES. This paired with the roasted sweet potatoes (pretty big portion might I add!) was excellent. Wish I could have finished everything.   It was a lot for 1 person but everything tasted clean!

First of all we ordered the Coco peanut brain milkshake was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. For our meals, we ordered one lunch special with the half garden veggie sandwich and half slaw salad as well as the black bean burger wrap. The food was tasty and nutritious. I definitely would recommend the sandwich and salad.  The ambience was quite nice but it would be nice to have been able to sit outdoors in the back there area. The service was overall good. They also have this amazing hot sauce that you need to ask for. Adds so much delicious flavor to the food.

I like that they have the option to add a burger patty (salmon or turkey) to the top of your salad if you want a more filling meal. I also really like that they have Wild Salmon, which I have a difficult time finding in NYC restaurants and its not overpriced. Why can't more places in NYC be like this?   They have options for Vegetarians, vegans and gluten free eaters. Great for a casual lunch or dinner, take out or to go in a grab a quick juice or smoothie. The only negative about Siggys (from a customers point of view) is its closed on Sundays.",

Because if you want to call Siggy's food \"good\", then you have to do that for everything else on the list. Is pizza just \"good,\" or is it better than thay? You get the idea.   I made the trek to Siggy's GREAT food last winter, and didn't have the highest hopes. Good = average, right? But one bite of the world's best salmon burger changed my mind. I've never had something like that and don't expect to again any time soon. But what really made my Siggy's AWESOME Food experience was the flank steak sandwich. Was it one of the best sandwiches I've ever had? Yes. Was it good? No. Was it AMAZING? Yes.   Definitely worth a visit if you like good (see above) food.",

Siggy's is not a strictly vegan or vegetarian, it offers options for both carnivores & herbivores alike. The inside is super nice, nicer than what I expected, and I suggest to go sit in the back of the restaurant which has booths and overlooks a garden.   I was very impressed by the great variety of the menu and almost everything looked good. My friend and I decided to get the Spring Garden wrap packed with veggies \"glued\" together with hummus and avocado. It was good, nothing too special and priced right.   Our server was very kind and we were in and out very quickly. Honestly, Siggy's didn't really kick it out of the ballpark for me but if I'm in the neighborhood, I would definitely come back and give it a second chance.",

My bf got a beef burger which he says was delicious, and I had the Moroccan chickpea & spinach bowl with tofu added. We also got the quinoa cake as an appetizer, and I had a cup of mint tea.   Everything was sooo well seasoned and flavorful. The quinoa cake was fantastic and one of the best appetizers I've had. It was very simple, but full of flavor.

It is personal trainer approved, but sublimely delicious and made with top level ingredients, so any foodie would approve.   And overall, Siggy's is special. It's a neighborhood gem. Not for tourists and an unusual place where it is clear that the establishment cares about it's customers -from the service they provide to the healthy, tasty food they serve. In addition to the Wild Salmon, I love the chicken dinner, the quinoa spinach cake and the parsley hummus appetizer.   And Siggy's has a casual atmosphere, a fireplace and staff who are amazing. They remember my name and face and are just cool, sweet people.   And I would literally recommend this spot to everyone from a model counting calories; a bodybuilder counting calories & wanting to eat meat; to vegans and everyone else.",

    "text": "Siggy's really named themselves appropriately because their food is pretty darn good taste-wise and health-wise! I came by here for lunch with a friend and we were seated quickly. It's a quaint spot with cool decor and fire escapes in the back that definitely remind you that you're in New York City.   Their options are generally local, grass-fed, or organic, which we appreciated. We ordered a salmon burger, flank steak sandwich, and berry buzz smoothie to share. They were also very kind as to help us split the smoothie into two separate glasses rather than just give us two straws for one cup. Everything was delicious! They pride their salmon burger for being free of fillers, and you could definitely notice how much better it tastes than other salmon patties, especially because it wasn't \"dough-y.\" The flank steak sandwich was a bit difficult to eat because the ciabatta roll was loaded with meat and veggies, but the flavor was great. The breads used in the burger and sandwich were also chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Each dish came with greens on the side, too. I also loved that the smoothie was tangy and sweet from only the natural fruit sugars. I do wish that it was a bigger portion overall for the $7.50 price tag.  It felt really great knowing that we were eating well without breaking our wallets and the best part was that everything was delicious too. One complaint I do have, though, is that we weren't offered bread and olive oil to start like all the other parties were. Since everyone else had it, I'm assuming it's complimentary so I don't know why we didn't get any. If you go, I would suggest mentioning it to your server if you aren't offered it. Other than the slight hiccup, I would recommend Siggy's, especially if you're an alien because aliens eat free here!",

    "text": "Summary:   Siggy's is a terrific spot for comfort food with gourmet flare, smoothies and juices, and a menu that offers something for everyone but that'll make vegans and vegetarians especially happy.  If you've been to Siggy's original Brooklyn location, the menu here mostly overlaps with the one there, but the space here is maybe two or three times bigger and more stylish.  Though the original location is cozy and a swell space to eat in, the new Siggy's feels more refined, somehow more like a restaurant.  You could come here with friends or family, but it'd work for casual dates too.   All the produce used is organic and, maybe more importantly, all the meat is sourced well (e.g. the beef is pastured).  Infinite plus points.  Misc details:  * The macaroni n' cheese is excellent.  The whole wheat pasta has more body and feels more substantial than plain pasta, and the cream & cheese sauce turns your mouth into a gooey wonderland.  My friends and I split this four ways and had it as an appetizer.  * The soup--black-eyed peas, tomatoes, and celery--was equally great.  It's a daily special, but if you like hearty vegetable soups and this is available, you'll like this.  * Salmon burger w/ feta on brioche--solid.  They were two sizeable patties side by side, and they paired well with the feta, smeared onto the toasted bun.  I liked this but I hear the turkey burger here is phenomenal, and the beef burger is all pastured-beef (as is all the beef served here), and I was left wishing I'd maybe tried one of those.  * The raspberry tart!  As with the BK location, this is the best dessert.  It's crispy, tart, sweet, and leaves you impressed that it's vegan.  It's not huge, but big enough to split two ways easy, or even three or four ways, if you want more of an amuse-bouche-y dessert.  * Siggy's has a small selection of organic beers--the Pinkus wheat lager is sweeter than most beers, but if you're okay with that it's a very good hefeweizen.  * It's also the sort of place that has theme-appropriate political flyers up in the bathrooms.  Did you know that Monsanto is suing Vermont because Vermont passed a law mandating all G.M.O. foods be labeled as such?  I did not know this but I do now.  Now, you might not worry about genetics and crops, reasoning that it's silly to worry about any such thing when we're all doomed anyway, what with the seas rising and the advent of the AI overlords nearly upon us!  So you might just go to Siggy's to enjoy wholesome food before that happens.  And that's okay.  The politics don't get in the way of the eating.",

Maybe just a stomach churning touch for Halloween diners?  Whatever the rationale, not my particular cup of tea.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here because it was tagged as \"Vegan\" on Yelp.  My friend is Vegan and I can't eat eggs, so we thought this would be a great place that would be able to accommodate us both.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the get-go, since we weren't ready to order immediately upon being seated.  Then he was annoyed that we were disappointed there were no french fries (only roasted potatoes - apparently this place only has healthy food) to go with the burgers.    We asked about our food restrictions, and the waiter assured my friend that the hamburger bun was vegan.  He then began to needle my friend about being vegan and lecture her about how she wasn't a very good vegan if she wanted french fries, which was totally inappropriate for him to comment on.  When it was my turn to order, I asked what kind of bread the hamburger bun was, and he said brioche.  I expressed shock that they had an eggless brioche, and he said yes, it was True.  Then he eventually agreed to double check... well lo and behold, he comes back to the table and admits that he was wrong, the brioche had egg in it, and therefore was not vegan at all.  So our only option for a burger at this place was to get it in a wrap with roasted potatoes.  Since this was no longer the burger meal we had envisioned, we decided to leave and go elsewhere.    The waiter followed us to the exit, still heckling my friend about how being vegan was not a valid dietary choice, how it wasn't as good as just eating healthy foods, how the oil that fried foods are cooked in was not vegan, etc etc etc until my friend was in tears and having an anxiety attack.  It was a very unpleasant experience, plus we still had to go elsewhere to eat.  The other employee at the front of the restaurant witnessed this part of the interaction and half-heartedly apologized for the waiter's behavior, but it did not seem like anyone took it all that seriously or was concerned about telling the waiter that kind of hassling of customers over their dietary choices was incredibly inappropriate, particularly at a restaurant that advertises itself as vegan.  Especially where the waiter's ignorance of the ingredients in the food nearly led the customers to eat non-vegan food.      I called the restaurant and left a message a week ago for management to convey our experiences, but I never received a return call, so I am posting here instead.",

    "text": "Came here with some friends, and got to admit that their ambiance is great.  Their wait staff is also really accommodating so overall non-food rating is 5 stars.    Drinks are $6-$8 for an organic smoothie, which is too expensive for me to swallow, even if they make it with organic and locally sourced fruits and vegetables.  If it was perhaps $4-$6 I would consider it.  To be fair, the price of the high quality goods is quite high, but there just isn't much reason for me to buy a drink so expensive.    Now on to food.  I got the salmon burger ($11) with a side of roasted potatoes (+$4).  The salmon burger was alright, 3.5 stars for the food but by itself I'm not too comfortable with what they offer for that price.  It was under-seasoned and the mayo dressing was slightly too heavy.  Roasted potatoes were actually roasted sweet potatoes, which I didn't order but I ate anyways.  They were seasoned all right, but very mushy, as if they boiled it and then gave it a light roast afterwards.  Just overall not what I was looking for when I ordered roasted potatoes.  2 stars there.    Oh and an organic cider goes for $6.    Overall I think this will be a great place to go if you were dining with a health conscious or vegan friend, but since most of my friends don't care all that much about organic or locally sourced and all that, I'll probably pass on this place for now.  Food is good, price is somewhat steep.",

I've been several times, everything is deliciously made with fresh / organic ingredients, and a few things really stand out.  The parsley hummus is like none other. It's a contender for possibly the best hummus I've had in my life - no joke. The bread that comes with it is chewy and fluffy and really addicting. And the olive oil on the side has a bit of a kick to it   Like everyone else has said, the salmon burger is super tasty and moist. It has just enough seasoning and dressing to make it delicious, while still keeping it simple. There aren't a zillion condiments and fixings like some other burgers I've had.   On the smoothies side: the green alien quencher is refreshing and makes me feel like I've done a good deed for my body because it's green and has vegetables in it. The spa skin secret (pineapple, mango, coconut milk, yogurt, honey) is also satisfyingly thick and creamy",

It came with onions and salad greens. The burger was seasoned with a (non-spicy) curry flavor, which I wasn't so sure I'd like at first but it was just perfect; the burger was really well-seasoned and delicious.  I inhaled the burger and then my server Eddie (who was awesome) helped me choose from the dessert options. I picked the gluten-free vegan chocolate chunk cookie.  It was so good, I swear I tasted butter! Crunchy on the edges, soft and chewy in the center, with many BIG chunks of chocolate - this was the real deal. Eddie told me after that I could have had it heated up with coconut milk ice cream.  I will be back for sure! :)",

Made sure we were content without being too intrusive. Even as we left, we had 2 \"good byes & thank you\" from workers/cashier/boss maybe?  Now the FOOD. Granted I was hungry, but still. I ordered a Salmon burger because yelpers recommended it. Wow!! I inhaled it & finished it quickly. I couldn't stop eating it. I finished my plate clean. No crumbs anything remaining haha. The salmon was soft w/ a unique fried texture. The salad w/ it was fresh. The bun was soft but not soggy. The avocado & mayo made the dish fabulous & tasteful. Especially the mayo.  I was really contemplating on taking one home to eat again, but I stopped myself =) Never knew healthy / organic food could taste so good. I was shocked.  We also ordered kale w/ garlic, also good. My friends ordered the chicken soup & chicken cutlet hero, which they enjoyed also.  The dessert was not that great though, so skip that.",

    "text": "Good food indeed. There are many kinds of foods that I'm sure would satisfy all kinds of human beings (and aliens from outer space) here at Siggy's. The best thing is the price. Now it's not McDonald's cheap, but it's cheap for food that is organic, prepared well, tastes good, and won't give you the dreaded bathroom visit an hour after eating.   It's a very discreet place, dark and awesome. I ordered pickup since I like to eat at home (it's awesome, try it) and I got the quinoa & spinach cakes that everyone seems to rave about and the salmon burger.   The quinoa & spinach cakes come with 2 patties topped with their tomato/cilantro salsa. Damn is the salsa good but the cake leaves something to be desired. I wish it had texture y'know? Maybe crispy on the outside and soft and \"quinoa-ey\" on the inside. A crab cake texture is what I was imagining but it was all soft and sort of mushed together in your mouth. Tasted okay, but the salsa saved it.   The salmon burger was damn good. Best salmon burger I've had ever. Good big piece of salmon, avocado, lettuce and their mayo on a brioche bun (but can be substituted for 7 grain, gluten free bun, wrap or naked on top of lettuce). Damn damn damn was it good. I definitely recommend getting that.   I look forward to my next run where I end up at Siggy's and try the other items on their menu.",

We both thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, and hubs practically inhaled the GF beer they had.  He doesn't care for most GF beers (poor guy, he was a former craft brew fanatic and now he's reduced to this) so it was exciting for him to try a new one and to actually enjoy it.  Mac n' cheese (Non-GF) was ok.  The lentil garlic soup was amaziballs.  Hubs had the burger (on a GF bun, of course) and was thoroughly engrossed in his food, so I'm pretty sure it was a hit with him.    Oh, and Siggy herself was in the kitchen and bouncing around the restaurant.  Thanks for offering healthy, quality food with GF options, Siggy!",

It was accompanied by Zinfandel and white bread with olive oil. I have to admit, the turkey burger was super-delicious! Service was good.  The decor is inviting. I will be back!",

I had the Splendid Raw Slaw with Sesame Kale & Cabbage and my +1 had the Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna .  We shared the Black Bean Sweet Potato Cakes.  Everything was so freakin' delish!  I couldn't even tell that there was no meat in the lasagna.  The salad was a big mound of veggies and goodness.  I'm totally going to back here to try something else sometime this week. Who knew eating raw would taste this good?!?",

Phew.. this place is fantastic.  My friend and I were in need of a tasty meal where we could soak up each other's company having not seen each other in ages. Siggy's went from a restaurant we had never heard of to what felt like our makeshift living room in a matter of 10 minutes.   We both shared the Greek avocado salad and parsley hummus. The hummus was exceptional, which says a lot from me because I am not always a huge fan of hummus j(ust one of those things). Avocado salad was the perfect amount of fluffy greens, quinoa, avoc, and a light lemon dressing. We also split the garlic herbs & artichoke pasta. I would hold this dish to one of the top pasta dishes I have ever had - comparing to authentic Italian pastas. It was that good! Highly recommend Siggy's for a guilt free indulgence on dinner!",

    "text": "Siggy's Good Food is such a neat little place that it's almost too good to be True. If you care about eating prepared organic food without paying exorbitant prices, this is it!   Yes, many eateries and formal restaurants have organic options these days but it seems more of a marketing trick as you never know quite what goes into your meal - the greens may be organic, but what kind of oil did they use to cook the burger, or the chicken? Did they use organic cold-pressed olive or vegetable oil or did they use cheap, non-organic, genetically modified Canola type oil in order to save on the cost of your meal? Did they use sea salt or cheap bleached table salt? It isn't enough that the greens are organic, or that one component of the meal is organic. Every ingredient has to be the healthiest available. I am not 100% sure of what goes into Siggy's food, but from what I've seen at the restaurant, from tasting my food, and the information on the menu.. it seems pretty certain that they use excellent ingredients.  One thing about prices... they are really cheap considering the cost of organic food. I buy organic food at the supermarket and it would cost me MORE to buy the ingredients at Whole Foods so considering the quality of the food, the prices are very, very good!   As for taste, everything we have had here is delicious. Not just health-food delicious (meaning the taste is acceptable as a trade-off for healthy ingredients - some people seem to think healthy food must be bland). It's plain delicious. We've had the salmon burger, chicken in garlic sauce (a daily special), turkey burger, sweet potatoes as a side, eggplant lasagna, kale salad. I recommend them all. Not to mention.. they gave us take out in a PAPER container rather than one of those ghastly plastic things that finds its way into a landfill to slowly degrade and leach chemicals for hundreds of years (if we won't destroy the planet before).  Whenever I am in the area, I will make my way to this place. If you care about good, clean food, about supporting organic farmers that don't poison the soil/water/air (and us), then support this place with your money. Thank you!",

They's especially great for anyone eating gluten free or vegan/vegetarian, but my friends without dietary restrictions also love going with me to Siggy's because there's such great selection.  I've had Siggy's eggplant lasagna (noodleless and vegan!) as well as their garlic artichoke/kale pasta, and both are FANTASTIC. However, what has brought me to yelp to give these kudos was their Salmon burger. Oh. My. God.  Best salmon burger I've ever had, by far -- and definitely one of the top 5 salmon dishes I've ever tasted!!  The other reviewers who promoted the salmon burger were not lying. It was so good that I've been craving another one and it's only been a few hours since dinner! If you're going to Siggy's for the first time, get the salmon burger, you WILL be hooked!  The only thing that would make me give Siggy's 5 stars is if they had a better policy on accommodating gluten free patrons. After explaining that I have celiac, the waiter explained that they can't guarantee any of their dishes to be 100% safe from cross contamination. I understand that they need to have this disclaimer, but they're such a gluten free friendly place with menu items labeled and special gluten free bread/beer, I feel like they should go the extra step and take 100% precaution against cross contamination. Now, I've never had a problem eating there in terms of getting glutened, but every time they explain they can't guarantee my meal safe, it still makes me feel nervous!  Other than that, everything else about Siggy's is perfect. Wholesome food, great flavor, reasonable price, and friendly staff. Highly recommend it if you're a conscientious eater!",

We had a great waiter - he was answering our questions, taking good care of us. All of a sudden the woman who we came to find out was the owner, came rushing on to the floor, we witnessed her grab one female server by the arm aggressively, and then pulled our waiter over, and in front of a restaurant full of people, reprimanded him and fired him. It was completely inappropriate and unprofessional. Unless your employee is causing bodily harm, there is no reason you can't wait until the end of a shift, or at very least pull him into the kitchen or your office. This woman seems like a tyrant, and I do not want to support an establishment where the employees are treated with such disrespect. Given her lack of management skills I don't know how she managed to hire such great people in the first place, but she's not treating them the way they deserve to be treated.",

I understand that some establishments need to enforce a minimum spend, but if that is the case, politely explaining this to customers should be the first step - not accusing them of purposely taking up a good table and wasting everyone's time, which is not at all what we had intended!

Siggy is the best she cares about the quality of the food #1 and you can taste it. If you are gluten free but love good food that doesn't taste like plastic I highly suggest this restaurant!",

I am so happy they opened up a Manhattan location.  Everything on the menu is very good.  The juices are good as well!  There usually isnt a wait here and its good for groups.",

Gluten-free is cross-contaminated but I have not had an issue yet and the staff has been very attentive. Non-alcoholic beverage selection could be improved- it would be nice to order some regular sodas.  I only wish they had more locations!",

She recommended this place, which I had never heard of.    I tried this out with a friend the week after.  It's conveniently and discreetly located close to Houston street, near wholefoods.   I passed the street the first time.  The server was friendly and helpful with recommendations,    I had the garden veggie sandwich, with hot tofu strips.  It was good, one of the better veggie sandwiches in NYC.    However, since it's so close to whole foods (my go to spot), i have yet to be back here.",
