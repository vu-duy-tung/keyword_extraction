    "text": "Just left this place. Can I say.. Delicious!!? My hubby & I arrived about 730 and waited about 10 minutes to be seated out on the patio. Inside was very packed, loud and the wait was half and hour. The sun was just going down so it was perfect and the musician was great! Decor was absolutely adorable and rustic. Loved it! We ordered quite a few items and enjoyed every bit! It was all very flavorful. (I am drooling as I'm typing just thinking about the food!) We ordered Brussel sprouts, roasted beets, hummus, forbidden rice, eggplant casserole & half a chicken. It was all very delicious but I must say the chicken was the best I've had! Moist & packed with flavor! We knew what we wanted & the food came out pretty quick, surprisingly on how packed it was.. No complaints though! Wish we had saved room for dessert! Our server was nice and attentive. We will be back, soon. Mmm mm GOOD!",

The interior atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the bar/kitchen area is fun and relaxed. Food portions were excellent and well made with fresh ingredients. We ordered the grilled octopus, small plate of hummus, spiced feta, and tzatziki, pulled pork panini, and the super grain salad - all fantastic!

    "text": "Went here for dinner on a Saturday to catch up with a friend, and I had high hopes, but was overall unimpressed. We came in around 5:45 and were seated immediately, which was a pleasant surprise, but the first impression I got was that it was all very sanitized and cold (as in unfriendly). Like the sort of place old white people go when they want to say nice things to each other's faces, then be snide behind each other's backs. Not a great atmosphere.  The waitress made a few recommendations, but the menu was quite limited. I appreciate that they rotate the menu seasonally, but that's no excuse for 6 appetizers, 4 salads, 4 sandwiches, and 5 entrees. They need a few signature staples that they can run on the menu. I did the classic \"scope out everyone else's order to see what I should get,\" but nothing really caught my eye. I decided that, being advertised as a Mediterranean restaurant, you can't go wrong with the lamb gyro. The lamb was very tender, but not very flavorful. Most of the flavor seemed to come from the oddly sour tzatziki it was drenched in. I was pleasantly surprised that it did come with a side of fingerling potatoes, which were seasoned to high heaven. It's like they couldn't decide what flavor they should be. My friend got the cilantro chicken salad, which was also drenched in dressing. Both plates were a normal human-sized serving (which is great for people who need help limiting portions on a diet), but at $10 for a chicken salad, I feel like there should be some leftovers to take home.  On the whole, it's a great concept behind their restaurant, but a rather cold atmosphere and meh food made it the sort of place we didn't want to stick around. Even though we were catching up on life, we stayed maybe an hour, tops. Ended up going somewhere else where we could enjoy dessert and each other's company. I'd say it's alright, but not worth your time.",

    "text": "To start the food at KC is both enjoyable and creative. Choices are varied yet as an overall menu works in a very pleasing way. I've order and enjoyed the Trout entree, lamb and also shared an evening of small plates with a group of four. Loved the roasted octopus which is hard to find here in Charlotte. Now for the downside. Three visits to the restaurant each one effected to the negative by the staff.  The front end staff and waiter/waitresses are not on par with the level or price of the food. Case in point, the last trip included; told my wait time would be 30-40 min at 6:30, went to the bar ordered a drink and they came to tell us the table is ready, great but each time I have gone to CK they can't seem to provide a correct wait time, how can you be off by 30 min at 6:30. Second we had an inside table and could not hear each other speak because it was so loud from all the parties of 6-12 (they only take resv for parties of 6 or more). It took our waiter almost 15 min to get back to our table to order because he had to explain the whole menu to a table of 12, maybe 2 waiters would help at large tables. Lastly our waiter did not return 2 credit cards to our table, lucky we had not gone far before we noticed, returned for the cards and received no apology for the last inconvenience. Sorry for the run on review but I hope owners/managers seriously look at the quality of the staff they are placing front and center to their guests. Food brings people in but bad service will keep them away",

Trout with quinoa tomato salad was amazeballs. Brussel sprouts, beet and arugula salad, lamb gyro (we ordered a lot) are all on the list of things I would definitely order again.  But I probably won't order again soon until they figure out how to run a restaurant... 15-20 minutes average time waiting for a drink.  To the point where you just go ahead and order another one as soon as you get one... AC broken which I know isn't there fault, but at least bring us water when we've asked four times?  Server messed up orders, bringing the completely wrong dishes on two different occasions.  When the right dishes arrived we had no silverware or plates for days. Had to beg the hostess (she was the only one trying to do anything) twice to please help us because no one was paying attention to any customer ever.  The manager happened to come by to deliver our salad and we alerted him to the trauma that was ensuing across most patrons that night.  He literally looked at us like we were reading him a manual on how to operate a vacuum cleaner.  Bizarre.  A massive thunderstorm blew in.  Customers were moving their own tables, food, babies, while this manager was doing nothing but looking at the sky in wonderment.  I'm so sad because i recommended that we come here to my friends because I believe in the food but that became a blip on the radar after dealing with what we went through.",

The ambiance is warm, inviting and non-pretentious. The service is non-stuffy but top notch. The food here is hands down the stand out!!! I'm one who likes to try everything possible and I love KC because of the small plates variety and half pound proteins to order. The must try is the octopus, mac and five cheese gratin, smoked nc mountain trout, beat & arugula salad, super green salad, forbidden rice & wild mushroom paella and slow cooked pork panini. The absolute to DIE FOR are the natural ground lamb burger (which I think is the best \"burger\" in all of Charlotte), leg of lamb and pork shoulder. I've eaten here 3 times already and I will be back again very soon. Definitely a True gem of a restaurant. By the way, forgot to mention if you want a cocktail, please do yourself a favor and order the Breast Milk. You can thank me later. Hats off to the wizards of Kid Cashew, Giorgios Bakatsias, Martin Sprock and Azam Mehdi. You guys did an incredible job with this place! Lastly, if you guys decided you want to go, I suggest going before peak hours. This place get's packed with a line out the door and a few people deep at the bar every time I've come to dine.",

We waited until all meals were delivered before we ate.  Everything is ala cart. The lamb burgers were chewy. The gyros use real lamb meat (not what I expected) and not much of it. Fairly expensive per meal. Drinks too. No commercial soda or ice tea. Hey, the water was free.  Meanwhile, our waiter got lost. By the time we wanted to leave, we had to wait for the check.

What they've done with this place is nothing short of amazing. I liken it to eating in a Pottery Barn with European cafe flair. Whoever designed this place and chose the decor should please come remodel my house.  The menu follows the KISS principle, is one page and neither tries to shotgun foodie palates nor overwhelm you with a drudgery of fanciful selections. The items are well chosen featuring fresh ingredients while still managing to cover a broad enough spectrum to have a little something for everyone.  The Oregano Chicken sandwich was an artfully presented dish that was more reminiscent of a chicken salad on flatbread. The best part was that it tasted great.  I liked my side dish even more than my main course; chunks of roasted red and golden beets with pistachios, whipped goat cheese and fresh orange sections. Simply fantastic with incredible depth of flavors!!  Our waiter was very good and not only took our joking around but joined in!  Great atmosphere all around - bustling with great energy! Local drafts= yay! Awesome place to come with a dinner club and share your dishes!!  Saving my fifth star to see if they can repeat this performance...",

    "text": "Stopped in here after an event with a few of my Yelp friends. This is in one of those restaurant spaces that has seen a high turnover in recent years but I think Kid Cashew is going to be very successful here.  There are a few different seating options here. On the left side of the restaurant are a few 4 seater bar tables. Across the aisle from those is a large family style table of at least 20 seats. To the right of that table are a few round tables and against the right wall are smaller tables with bench seating against the wall. There is also seating at the bar in the back and a large patio out front so there are plenty of seating options.  The menu consists of small plates and items to be shared with a few sandwiches and salads mixed in. They also have a craft cocktail selection, local craft beer and a decent wine selection.  We had a group of 6 and we all ordered something different so we could sample each others meals. My selections were the portobello mushroom sandwich and the brussels sprouts.  The mushroom burger was really good with a good mixture of flavors. I'd put it in my top 2 of local portabello sandwiches. The brussel sprouts were good but some of them were a little undercooked. I was able to sample some of the other plates at our table. The lemon-oregano chicken sandwich is an open faced sandwich with great flavors. The wood-fired beets were the real winner in my book.    Despite being advertised as small plates and sharable items, the portion sizes were decent and actually on the large side of small, if that makes any sense.    I thought the service was great despite the fact they were busy. Our server, Joshua, was amazing and everyone else helped out where they could.   I definitely plan to visit this place more often, especially since I live so close.",

The decor is beautiful and so unique.  The owner was is from Greece, so no wonder the food was delicious!  We ordered their winning beef mac & cheese for appetizer.  We also ordered the trout, lamb burger, and Brussels sprouts to share for dinner...all which were nothing short of AMAZING!  I have to say the lamb burger is out of this world and won my heart.  We absolutely cannot wait to bring family & friends to try this spot.",

    "text": "Decided to come here for my birthday dinner with my best friend. Perfect decision. The food was great, the price was perfect. The wine was good. Decor was beautiful.   Okay. Let's dig deeper. 20 min wait which was absolutely fine, actually seated us quicker. First thing we notice was the awesome decor of this place! We take a look at the menu and then had the waitress explain what to do. Basically you can add a protein from their list to any salad or sandwich or you can share a protein and sides. We decided to share a leg of lamb, eggplant casserole and potato gratin as the waitress said it was plenty food for two. I enjoyed a glass of Cabernet while the wait. Great, flavorful wine. Our meal came and it was plenty for both. Although I'm pretty sure I could have killed it alone. Lol! Just make sure you order more sides if you have a large appetite. Everything was cooked perfectly. and tasted great!   They have two options for dessert. Bakalava and a sundae. We got both! And they were worth every calorie! So delicious. The sundae is pretty big so I would share if i were with a date that wanted it. Since we shared the food, we split the bill down the middle putting us at 27 a piece. Not bad at all!   My only complaint and I mean only, is that there were moments I was literally sweating everywhere! I don't know if it's because it has an open kitchen concept or the air wasn't working. I was so uncomfortable. Even my cold natured, always freezing, company was sweating....This resulted in the four outta five stars. If they could improve this air conditioning situation, this place would be perfect!",

It was so full of flavor and it's paired with a dipping sauce. The sandwiches do come paired with potatoes although it's not indicated on the menu. The mac and cheese was okay but nothing special to write home about. I did like the Goat's Breastmilk, it can have a strong licorice bite to it, but I thought it was tasty.  I will definitely be back because I want to try the two patty lamb burger and some other dishes.",

We had a group of six and were seated at a round table, a little small for six, but we made it work.  The place was packed, with a variety of customers, from friends to couples to even families enjoying Sunday dinner.   After taking a look the menu, it is what they advertised, a variety of small plates, definitely a little larger than tapas, but allows you to order multiple to share.  Out of the six of we are all ordered different items which was great. I went with the pork sandwich. Sliced pork on toast with arugula and spicy mustard.  Loved it. I also tasted the chicken and brussel sprouts and enjoyed them both as well.  There were a few items at the table I didn't get to try, but the others enjoyed, and all the reason to get me back to try those items.  I know it was a Sunday night and it was crowded, but I do wish the service was a little better.  Our server seemed a little overwhelmed and forgot my sandwich so I had to beg the others to go ahead and start, yet I had to ask our waiter twice for my dinner.   Overall, I really enjoyed Kid Cashew and am so happy they have come to the neighborhood. Count me in for being back soon!",

I did take a peek inside the restaurant which was equally as quaint and adorable. This place is very unique in comparison to other spots to stop in for lunch or brunch on east Blvd. I was blown away when I saw the menu, on top of all the healthy options... there were atleast ten vegan options that were not all salads. I ordered the vegan portobello gyro with lettuce, tomatoes, and chipotle sauce. It was delicious! My friend did the chicken salad sandwich with avocado which she enjoyed as well. We had excellent service despite the outdoor patio being packed. This is a great restaurant in Charlotte  with awesome vegan and healthy options! I will def be back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "While I don't claim to be a prophet on my LinkedIn, I will make a prediction: this somewhat recent revolving door spot has finally found a permanent resident.  This used to be Tijuana Flats. Before that, Italian Pie. For all you True Charlotteans out there, you'll always remember it as the legendary Wad's Soda Shop that had a nearly 40 year run here.   My friend and I got two cocktails from the living libations section of the menu: the Cilantro (tequila, cucumber, jalapeno) and the Thyme (bourbon, peach, honey, bitters). Both were delicious. You've probably figured out by now from my reviews that I always go for any drink with some spice. I like that the wine is served as four ounce pours (don't worry, the price reflects that).   Food wise we decided on the octopus (perfectly cooked), mac & cheese gratin  (leeks, shallots, 5 cheeses, awesomeness), forbidden rice & mushroom paella, NC Mountain trout, and baklava. An absolutely fantastic meal, but I would have to say the biggest surprise was how delicious the quinoa was that came with the fish. It had a citrusy flavor twist to it. I could eat an entire bowl by itself. We split all the food, including the fish. It was a good sized piece. Next time, I want to try the gelato and the beet salad. Both sound pretty amazing.   The decor is rustic and beautiful, even the background music was great. There's a long community table in the middle. It was packed when we walked in, but we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Service was top notch. Our server Matt was amazing. On top of that, the manager stopped by to check on all the tables as well. The parking lot is kind of small. If it's full, check the side street off East. It's ja short walk.   This kind of feels like a place Dilworth has been waiting for and needing. Congrats to Kid Cashew, I look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "I arrived at Kid Cashew around 6:30  p.m. on a Tuesday night.  The parking lot was full - not an anomaly in Dilworth - but we were able to find street parking.    Fortunately, the weather was nice this late-June night, so we were able to request a seat on the patio.  There was no wait - we were escorted to a table immediately.  Tuesdays at Kid Cashew are 1/2 price bottle of wine night - this means you can grab a bottle for as little as $15 -- woot!    My partner opted for a gin/cilantro drink prior to dipping into the bottle of wine.  The cilantro drink was quite tasty, though very sweet.  Our server explained that all dishes come out as they are ready - so be prepared for a staggered serving.  Soon after our drinks arrived, we received the smoked trout dip and chargrilled octopus.  The smoked trout dip was the highlight of the evening - served with grilled multigrain bread and creme fraiche - it was delightful and definitely a repeat order. The chargrilled octopus was not overly chewy - rather, it was cooked perfectly, though i i didn't love how much char was actually on the meat.    Next, we received the eggplant casserole and brussels sprouts.  The eggplant was very tasty, though it didn't just blow me away.  I had very high expectations for the brussels sprouts - first, i love roasted brussels sprouts and it's not hard to prepare them really well, and second, I had read a lot of amazing reviews on these sprouts.  Now, they were good and I would likely order them again....except, I would ask them to use less salt. If they had used a quarter of the salt originally used, these sprouts could have been amazing.  As served, they were just tooooo salty.    Finally, the atmosphere.  The venue is really nice.  There are beautiful chandeliers and a cool bar inside.  The patio outside is surrounded by potted plants and great tables. What was odd, however, was the live music. They had an acoustic guitar player on the patio that was very good...except he was amped up and way too loud.  It was hard to carry on a conversation when he was playing...which was during most of the meal.  Now, don't get me wrong, I really love live music, but this was out of control.  Given the opportunity, I'll definitely go back to Kid Cashew -- but, I'll avoid the patio if there's live music and I'll ask for less salt on my brussels sprouts.",

    "text": "Delicious food, but so very loud. It was restaurant week when we visited, but that menu was small, so we ordered from the regular menu which has a wide variety of cuisine and price points. Their sandwiches are around $9 while entrees are closer to $18. The pork belly panini was out of this world as was the spicy feta dip. Other members of our party ordered the gyro, salmon, and trout. All were pleased. Sandwiches come with a side of fingerling potatoes, which were lacking a bit of flavor but were cooked well.   I tried the goat's breast milk. It was described as creamy, but tasted like a spritzy mojito. I was disappointed, so I opted for a glass of Chardonnay instead. Their drink menu had plenty of options to suit all tastes. It took awhile for our drinks to come out throughout the meal, but service at the bar seemed fairly quick.   There are no acoustics inside. So although the atmosphere is chic and inviting, I would not return unless we could sit on the patio.",

After fifteen minutes no one had come to our table, filled our water or even acknowledged our presence. At that point I asked the hostess how we got service. 5 minutes later, we called it quits and left. Hostess couldn't even stand up from leaning on the counter to apologize. Horrible. We won't be back!",

I never even liked brussel sprouts before having them here at the event, but now I am craving them.

Although I think the restaurant it self is trying to figure out the \"team work\" - there was some confusion about who took the order, he bounced back and made sure the order was put in. We got Cilantro and Thyme drinks. (I favored Cilantro better - very refreshing and good am for summer). Spinach & fera dip - YUM! We followed by what seems to be family style meals: Leg of lamb, Mac and cheese, and brussels sprouts - delish! Tzaziki and cilantro sauce paired up amazingly.   Two downfalls to the atmosphere (none that cannot be fixed): 1) bathrooms felt like a sauna.  2) tables that are close to the bar had overwhelming crowd. Neither servers or guests could easily pass through. Had to wait out the traffic.   Overall, I'll be back for some more! Bring back the lamb chop on the bone Kid Cashew!",

The service is much better than before being able to describe menu items in a way that doesn't leave me wondering why I don't just google it. I'm also very happy that seasoning issues have been fixed and the octopus we ordered did not taste like a salt block this time! Unfortunately the lamb was so overcooked and dry that I could not recommend it. I did finally get to try the cocktails here though they are now updated. The strawberry basil is kind of like a summerfied moscow mule. Delicious! I have to admit they are now much more likely to be a repeat destination for me.",

The whole place was far from crowded so one would think that it wouldn't take too long to take our order let alone our food. Half of our group received their order while the other have waited to for the staff to take our order. Also, one from our group didn't receive his lamb burger until an hour he made his order and after everyone finished their meals. To make matters worse, one from our group complained of the lackluster service and the manager from the night (the one with the Captain America tattoo on his left elbow), appeared to not want to hear of a legitimate complaint of slow service. He responded to a customer by rolling his eyes which was both rude and an inappropriate response to listening to a customers complaint. He did not seem to care which was baffling. I do not like giving a negative review but when a restaurant's staff is indifferent to providing good and attentive customer service, it's difficult to turn a blind eye to it.",

The manager, bartender and the chef were EXTREMELY friendly and accommodating. The chef even came over and mentioned some recommendations and checked on us after we got our food.  One of the best meals that I've had in a while.  Ordered the spicy feta cheese appetizer, 1/2 chicken as an entree with the sides of mac'n cheese and the brussel sprouts.  My taste buds were definitely satisfied!  In addition, on Tuesdays it is half off bottles of wine which we took advantage of.  When you combine such great personalities and friendliness with excellent food it is a recipe for a successful place.  Keep up the great work ladies and gents!!",

The best beet and arugula salad I've ever had was here.  They have amazing Brussels sprouts and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I would definitely eat here often.  It was a great vibe.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 star is that you can't do any substitutions. For example, if a dish comes with brussels sprouts and you don't like them, you can't switch it for a different side like green beans or chips.  You have to order it as it comes on the menu which doesn't seem fair to the individual purchasing the food.  I definitely plan to go back as they have a lot of healthy choices on the menu.  It's definitely the type of menu that makes you want to try more than one item.  I suggest going with friends who like to share! They also have nice outdoor seating for those who like to be outside.",

They had wait staff and food delivery people everywhere, but the whole experience room us over two hours since our actual waiter only stopped by rarely. One member of our party didn't get her food (salmon and fingerling potatoes) until everyone else had completely finished. Here is what we got: -Spinach feta dip, which was good - more spinach than cheese.  -Fingerling potatoes, boring. No real flavor. -Brussels sprouts, also yummy but not a lot of flavor -Portabello mushroom sandwich - this was really good! I'm not vegetation but enjoyed all the flavors going on! Yum. -Lamb sandwich - also very good and rich, perfectly cooked. -Octopus starter - this is lying eat time trying octopus and I didn't love it, but I think it was well made. I just didn't like the texture of the meat. -Goats Breast Milk carafe - my favorite! This almost made up for the wait and the bland starters/sides. Delicious!

We started with the spinach and feta dip. It was good (how can it not be?) but a bit greasy. I then went with the chicken gyro. It wasn't well-balanced. The sauce was all over the lettuce, but not the chicken itself, making it really dry. On top of that, it just wasn't good-quality chicken. I figured they'd use the rotisserie chicken in it, but it tasted really cheap. I didn't end up finishing it because it really wasn't that great. My wife also had something different from last time (the lamb gyro), and didn't love hers either.   I think we're a bit more cautious now. Maybe it just depends on what you order.",

It came in a hot little cast iron dish, was heavy on the spinach and also had some cream cheese in it. The pits that came with it was perfect and warm. And the ratio of pita to dip was spot on. My husband got the Big Mac Daddy Burger which came with chips. The chips were more kettle cooked style, spicy with a hint of dill. I could literally eat them all day. The burger was really good-and I'm not a huge burger person, but I did steal 3 bites before my husband could take it away from me. Friends with us also said they really enjoy their lamb burgers, squid small plate, brussel sprouts, and wings.",

The quinoa stuffed avocado was a great small plate to start with the I had a small plate of shrimp polenta for my dinner. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD good! And don't get me started on my friends dreamy white beans. Why are you still reading this & not running to kid cashew???",

    "text": "After having this place booked for a year I finally made it over today after checking out the Discovery Place nature facility. I Love the look of this place from the patio to the interior with the lovely chandeliers hanging. We arrived at about 4pm on a Saturday and was quickly greeted and shortly thereafter taken to a half booth half seat table and our server Adam came by with water and to say Hello.  We quickly ordered as we were starving, our toddler had the grilled cheese from the kids menu with chips and I asked Adam what was the best item from the Vegan menu and he was all inside my head as I was thinking of getting the Gyro and he promptly responded that his Fav item was the Portobello Hummus Gyro which I happily ordered and I also asked for a quinoa stuff avocado for a started. My husband ordered the beef skewers as an app and a Lamb Burger for his meal.  It was great to have a server to ask how we wanted the food to come out as we prefer our son food to always come out 1st or with apps and he put it in just that way and that's how it came out hot and fresh. My husband is a huge non-alcoholic Ginger beer fan so we inquired and Adam suggested a MockTail that included fresh cucumber, mint and ginger beer in a Moscow mule (non alcoholic) mug. We agreed and when I tell you it was amazing I mean it.  We all enjoyed our meal, my husband says the beef skewers is a must (Im Vegan so I wouldn't have any input but he is a foodie so I trust his opinion). The avocado stuffed with quinoa is a Must for me.  I look forward to working my way through the Vegan menu before the year ends as we will Be Back.",

I was very nervous to take 15 people to a small restaurant, but they did a fantastic job!!   Service was quick, mimosas were fabulous, and everyone talked about the food!!   For their brunch, I recommend the Madame Croque & caraffe mimosas.   Lunch / Dinner - I am a huge fan on their Gyro and stuffed avocado.   THE STUFFED AVOCADO is so amazing! Very different, yumm!!",

    "text": "Three colleagues and I came to Kid Cashew on a beautifu day, in which we enjoyed sitting at the outside dining area of Kid Cashew.  If at all possible, I would highly recommend enjoying your meal outside.  Our waitress, though I forgot her name, was a little scary.  She did not give a good vibe and the 4 of us felt a little put off by her.  She had a slight attitude and it was really hard to get her (or anyone else's) attention for long periods of time.  Apparently we were told it was very busy that evening.    Drinks - excellent, unique cocktails that were delicious - would highly recommend.  While the place gets rave reviews by my fellow Yelpers, I thought this place was just decent food-wise.  We started with the duo of spreads - pass on the hummus, but the tzatziki was so, so good!!  Worth a try as an appetizer.  The mac and 5-cheese side dish was also very good - cheesy for sure, but very good.  The brussel sprouts were just okay for me - I've had much better elsewhere and these didn't have the crisp I like.  For my main dish, I debated a long while and finally went for the lamb burger.  See, I LOVE lamb burgers, especially with feta cheese, but this just wasn't memorable for me.  I didn't end up finishing it.  Not sure what it was exactly - maybe a lack of seasoning?  It came with potato chips.  I guess it just didn't have as much of that gamey lamb flavor I love also.  Dessert was a huge fail for us.  They don't have an actual dessert menu - just ice cream and baklava.  We wanted ice cream and our ice cream came in the form of soft serve, half melted.  Who serves half-melted soft serve in a glass and calls it ice cream?  The baklava was also mediocre for us, unfortunately.  Food was okay, service could be improved, and dessert was a pass for us, but nevertheless I don't regret trying the place!",

Finally, we were able to go right before the dinner rush. I have mixed feelings about this place.   We started with the hummus as an appetizer and I wasn't a fan. It was a bit hard and lacked a bit of flavor, however, it wasn't bland. For dinner I had the Wood Fire Grilled Portobello Hummus Gyro. Although the hummus was just okay on its own, it was good in this gyro. The side was just chips.",

Got up early in Brentwood/LA and caught a early flight from LAX.  5 hours later and we arrive at Charlotte Douglas and I was in no mood to tackle I-77 traffic between the airport and Cornelius so decided to have dinner down in Charlotte.  Thought of a couple places but they were either closed or a drive in so ended up at Kid Cashew which oddly enough had been on list of restaurant to try anyway.  Walked in and was promptly seated and presented with a menu and the took my order for Sweet Tea right away.  One item on the menu piqued my interest and that was the Knocks Your Socks Off BBQ.  I love Eastern NC Style BBQ and the Pulled Pork with Cole Slaw and a dressing that was described as a mixture of vinegar and peppers on Brioche translated to me a dressed up Eastern NC BBQ so I went with it.  I was not disappointed.  It was delicious. Nice and meaty with a moist smoky taste. I don;t normally like Cole Slaw unless I make it myself but this was delicious with a hint of Citrus.  Chips were great.  Don't normally eat desert but the talked me into a Gelato with Caramel Sauce and nuts.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOverwhelming.in&s=3f9de026b4d279f7caaa32db4157c0367a4869db98670d8626e7a39bd5f0e684\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Overwhelming.in</a> size with great taste.  Excellent somewhat upscale atmosphere in a tastefully styled restaurant. Staff and manager are very friendly and will do anything they can to make your visit pleasurable.",

I was disappointed in the dessert options-- only baklava and a gelato flavor, however they did make it a sundae with chocolate sauce and Heath topping.   My friends got the brussel sprouts and shrimp. The Brussels had a lot of oil at the bottom. The shrimp was good, but it was a lot of sauce with nothing to soak it up, so we asked for a side of pita bread.   Sparkling rose was perfect for the summer!",

The service was great and when I asked what I should order, drink wise, our server recommended the Goats Breastmilk I think it was called. It was an original combo of Ouzo and Amaretto and I think lemon and basil. It hit the spot. Looks like they have five dollar craft cocktails on Thursdays too along with other daily drink specials every other day of the week.  For food we started with the regular hummus. It comes with warm, fresh pita and you can add carrots and celery for two dollars. I got a Greek salad and didn't see the roasted red peppers on the menu when I ordered. I don't care for those and would prefer just regular, crisp red pepper but it was a generous size and had good flavor. I paired that with the beef skewers which were very flavorful and cooked just to my liking. Two skewers come in and order so it was a nice sized lunch.",

Nothing more can be said about a terrific spot on East Blvd. that affords you dozens of options to walk too once you've finished with a meal and mercilessly punishes any restaurant that doesn't consistently deliver the best experiences.  They've pretty much gutted the old pizza place (wasn't that what it was before this one most recently?) and made it look and feel a whole lot like \"Good Food on Montford\".  While the trendiness is certainly appreciated, it feels cramped inside and does not make me feel like it would be a decent place to bring a hot date due to the loud chatter, and close proximity of other patrons.  Outside, the patio area has also been revamped and opened up, which is nice, and actually a tolerable place to sit if it's not the middle of summer.  Our waiter was a nice young guy I think was named Joe or Chad or Beau who, while I'm pretty sure didn't make the football team in high school, sure did party with that crew.  He didn't quite know much about the beers other than the Bud Light, surprisingly, so when we ordered what we thought was one beer and wound up with it's seasonal variety instead, should have taken more initiative to take away the erroneous brew.  Sorry bro, but your bad if you say its Kronenbourg \"kinda like a bud light, or Heineken, yea\" and then Kronenbourg Blanc comes out which is definitely a fruity, cloudy, wheat beer, and not much at all like those other lagers.    My lamb burger was decent.  Burger was cooked properly, and the meat was seasoned well.  The bun was weak, and didn't hold up, so the burger wound up a mess in my hand.  They have the chef's version of \"Mediterranean fries\" is what Joe the waiter with the look like he just crushed the whippet hits from the whipped cream cans back in the walk-in freezer, informed us, which were basically super salty and super seasoned fingerlings that were roasted in an oven that wasn't hot enough to get that little crispy brownness you have to have to get those right.  My wife however ordered a barbeque panini or something like that.  Described basically as southern BBQ style pork on a panini.  So she was surprised when a club sandwhich on store-bought wheat bread came out with sliced (not pulled) pork shoulder.  Not a panini, not pulled pork BBQ.    It was a total miss for her and I felt bad my date night had so many blunders given the fact I was looking forward to trying the Mediterranean... wait it's a Mediterranean BBQ place called... hang on, what's it called?  I didn't see any nuts on the menu, meh whatever - it's a miss for us - Kid Cashew.",

It's sad that this place came out of the gate crushing it and now the food is either over seasoned or under. There is no longer any type of consistency in any dish. The Octopus is rubbery - the Brussels sprouts seasoning is so bitter they're inedible - the lamb is bland and overall the entire experience makes you wonder if the owner's supplier is getting all of their ingredients as it's about to expire at a massive discount. They've officially lost my business for good. Such a shame for a great space and concept.",

I'm usually a Pio Pio guy but I had Peruvian days before so needed something different so took my chances here.    The smiling faces at the entrance helped the experience but the service topped it off.  I sat at the bar and was served by a bartender named Pickles.  He was definitely a talker, but he gave some great advise on making sure my lunch was divine.  I enjoyed an incredible salad with quinoa, chicken, and avocado.  But the menu looked so good, honestly I couldn't decide what to get.  I do want to come back for the lamb and the all natural chicken.    This place is definitely one of those places you want to bring over for a date, a professional luncheon, or even a group of friends to enjoy some drinks and good food.  I will come back again!",

I really like their concept of taking things straight from the garden/butcher to the kitchen. My girlfriend and I decided to enjoy our meal tapas style and share everything, although you can of course order entrees separate and not share. We tried the spicy feta dip, octopus, and lamb burger. The spicy feta dip was pretty good, especially with the toasted bread, and it was surprisingly spicy. The octopus was cooked perfectly, just charred on the outside but still very tender. The lamb burger was definitely the highlight of the meal! It came out medium and super juicy. The tzatziki sauce and onions added some great flavor, and it was simply superb overall. We left extremely satisfied with the taste of the food, the prices, and the service. We will be back!",

My wife had the stuffed French toast, it was good, but super filling super fast. I had the lamb burger, probably the best I have had in Charlotte, the lamb patties were juicy, flavorful, and the herbs in the patty added so much fresh flavor, it cut out that fatty feeling you get when you eat lamb! We also tried the side of beets, which I loved, and the Mac and cheese which was also really good. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this place, we for sure will come back to try for dinner or lunch again!",

    "text": "First the good:  My salad with quinoa, pistachios and avocado was really good if not hard to eat.  The tall bowl was packed to the rim with gigantic lettuce leaves.  Luckily, I had a spare plate that I could use to chop it up.  I still ended up getting quite a bit sprinkled in my lap and on the floor.  As someone who doesn't eat meat or dairy, this was really the only meal option I had.  It was tasty but still salad.  The restaurant is fairly nice but relies on those features all new restaurants share: exposed wood beams, open floor plan and Edison lights.  This makes for one noisy restaurant once the place was full.  My dining partner and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.  We would have sat outside but there was a singing guitarist out there.  Of course he had the speakers turned waaayyy up.  It's like the management decided that if it was quiet outside, people might realize how not-quiet it was inside.  Why not maybe the patio really, really loud too? On a Tuesday night?    I asked my friend if she would go back considering she had a lot more menu options than I did and her husband hadn't been there.  She had really enjoyed her dinner but given a night out, she would probably look for somewhere quieter.",

My friend had a glass of Rose, nice. Dry as it should be, not the faux-Rose that's really white zinfandel in diguise. I had a Tito's and soda- can't go wrong with that.  We ordered the octopus. My first try was not an anomaly - again, it was flavorful and tender. So, so good. We also got the spinach and feta dip. Sometimes such concoctions lose the flavor definitions and turn into junk food- this was quite good. Spinach tasted like spinach. Perhaps a crispy pita vs the soft would add some texture variance, but I'm just being provocative- we enjoyed as it was served.  I happen to like KC. Look forward to many more visits and experimenting with the menu.",

Fiance had the chicken avocado sandwich. Both had amazing flavor. The food is definitely worth this price you pay and the portions aren't skimpy. A lot of places that fall just above casual dining but are not quite \"fine dining\" charge prices for food that just don't feel justified. This is not that kind of place. The atmosphere makes for a great date night and the cocktails/drinks are fantastic. Food quality and service are wonderful. We will be back!",

    "text": "I had a nice experience here.  With some attention to detail, this would be a five star review.    The pricing was reasonable and fair.  Brussel Sprouts were good if not a bit plain.  The slow cooked pork panini was fantastic.  The spicy mustard on the multigrain bread was a great texture and flavor combo.  The portion of the sandwich was perfect.  The trout was also good and a nice portion.  The drinks were creative and destination worthy.  The vanilla gelato was not worth ordering.  The gelato portion was huge, it just wasn't very good (tasted and felt like average vanilla ice cream)      We didn't have any issues with the food coming out at different times, but I can understand how this would aggravate certain diners.  Be prepared to have the food come to your table in random intervals.  They don't use heat lamps or microwaves, so if something is ready before another part of the meal, it's showing up before the rest.  Kid cashew may lean a little too heavily on this and should probably strive to execute better timing.   Decor and Ambiance are five star.  I dined on the sizeable patio next to some angry ants that thought our table was really theirs.  They understood better after I squashed some of their relatives.  The inside looks really nice.    They have a very upscale casual vibe going, but you get the sense that there's a disconnect between the quality of the service and what customers expect the service to be.  Based on the formal server attire, I expected a more attentive experience even though the menu pricing didn't signify fine dining.  Just some details.",

We went with another couple this time and had the octopus which was very very tasty the hummus Trio which was very good as well and then the black rice dish I can't remember the name of it it was Bland it was just ok. The service was good the drink pours were great and the atmosphere was Lively.   Im torn here on this place. I'll start from the beginning. I was sitting at the bar waiting on my wife for dinner, as we always sit at the bar to eat. Its usually great people watching and better service. I started off with a guy bartender very friendly then he left his shift at 5 p.m. and then a black woman bartender took over. She was ok, not overly friendly but did a good job orher than not clearing our app plates till then end of dinner.  So I start exploring the menu before my wife arrives and I see an entree North Carolina mountain trout. Now I am a trout fisherman for 10 years and there is no such species as a North Carolina mountain trout. So I asked the bartender which the bar and Kitchen almost share the same space he turns around and asks the executive chef, what is a nc mountain trout. In the executive chef very arrogantly tells him it's North Carolina mountain trout. Again that is not a species I asked if it was a rainbow or brown trout and he said it's a North Carolina mountain trout. That tells me he does not know what kind of fish he is  buying. The appetizer of shrimp with the sauce was incredible my wife's beet salad with salmon was really good the eggplant side dish was Bland and just ok. I used the sauce from our appetizer was the plate was still there to pull over my trout the trout was perfectly cooked and very tasty. I don't know if I'll be back or not with so many other options in Charlotte we have to be wowed right out of the gate and we just weren't.",

My friend ordered the cucumber mule and it was exceptional. All of their cocktails look awesome and I definitely want to come back to try more. Service was so so. Our waitress did what was needed to be done but was not over the top efficient, friendly, or knowledgeable. Most of us ordered salmon and we got a cheese dip for the table and mac n cheese and brussel sprouts. The dip was exceptional and their salmon is spot on. Everyone loved their food and we very much enjoyed the evening. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu, great concept and wonderful decorations!",

I'm in the restaurant business and this place is run by novices. Don't waste your time or money here.",

I am probably spelling it wrong) greeted us promptly. Immediately we noticed how loud the table was next to us and we asked to move. Even though the restaurant was busy, they kindly moved us to a much quieter table! We enjoyed the trout and Big Mac daddy burger, butternut hummus and Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious and unique! 5 stars for food and service. Definitely recommend Kid Cashew.",

It's that good. -Gelato: It's legit. But not out of the ordinary.   Until next time, Charlotte!",

Bartender Jaime took excellent care of us with delicious $5 Bloody Marys to start. Wife had a beet & arugula salad, portobello sandwich and I had a pulled chicken with avocado sandwich.  Food was outstanding-great flavors and nice size portions.  From our barstools we had a great view of the food coming up for service.  Watching the kitchen crew finalize plates was like watching a choreographed show.  No fryers or freezer in this restaurant and you could taste it in the freshness of the food.  The GM chatted us up as he was going about his duties.  You could tell by the attitudes of everyone working here that they live what they do and it shows .  Highly recommend this place for great food and service!  And a show!",

My friend ordered the lamb burger and he definitely enjoyed it,  although he did say he's had better. I'm not much of a drinker,  but they had some dark aged rum that I couldn't resist and the drink was great. My friends beer was a tad bit warm, the waiter apologized and the hostess/manager came over with a complementary hummus dip. Pleasantly surprised!  Nice atmosphere, good food and great service.",

I regret not getting our waiter's name because he gave us excellent service- super nice and had drink refills on deck before it had even occurred to me to ask for one. I loved the cold brew coffee this place served. As a heavy coffee drinker, I am often disappointed when breakfast places do not have a cold brew coffee or even just normally brewed coffee that is already cold on standby. At Kid Cashew however, our server offered up a delicious cold brew in the afternoon that I very much enjoyed. On top of the great service and food is a warm atmosphere and entertaining decor. Definitely will be going back to this place!",

The menu is constantly changing, the flavors are always delicious, the atmosphere warm and welcoming, and the service friendly and attentive. They do not have a freezer, so everything is fresh (sorry no ice cream desserts). Their cocktail menu and beer selection are both strong. Summer time, they have an excellent patio.   This space has been cursed by so many restaurants failing, but this one has done well and I can only assume that as long as it stays managed well, it will  be here for a long time because they always have a great crowd wa successful concept.   Update: We came back recently with a group of 5 adult men and were placed at a small table surrounded by 2 tables filled with a 1:1 ratio of fathers to daughters (presumably a Daddy/daughter dance), 3 tables from the door after specifically asking to be placed away from the door. There was a 6 top table available away from the children and the door, but the hostess (dressed in yoga pants and a sweatshirt) would not move us because of reservations. We took advantage of the tasting that they offered that evening, which meant LOTS of plates, and given the small table and adult men, there was just not enough room. By the time we finished our meal and were paying out checks, the 6 top was still empty. I pulled the manager aside and explained that 1. Our food was absolutely delicious and that part never disappoints. 2. The server did an excellent job and very happy with him. 3. Due to the table placement and the hostess response, it was a huge detraction. He listened, agreed, apologized and even helped out with the bill a bit. I didn't say anything to get a discount, but rather offer feedback, but it was a greatly appreciated gesture. Plus, I had the feeling he really listened to the feedback and was not just appeasing me. For this and everything else I love about this place, we'll continue to go back.",

The French toast was cook to perfection , not to much but not to little . The Mac & Cheese was not \"dusty\" but cheesy and definitely homemade . The rotisserie chicken was perfectly seasoned , juicy and very filling . The steak and eggs was yummy , the steak was medium well and cooked just the way I want it and asked. The eggs was great as well. I would definitely go back to try the rest of the menu out and this restaurant gets 5 stars from me. The ambience and outside seating of this place is fabulous.",

The portion was decent, and the bread was hearty and sturdy enough to hold the thick layer of avocado and chopped veggies layered on top. The flavors were fresh and vibrant, with the tomato/onion mix providing a nice acidic touch to the creamy avocado.   For dinner, I began with the tzatziki and pita, which was very good. The pita was soft and warm, while the tzatziki sauce was refreshingly crisp. I then ordered the salmon and the vegan brussels sprouts, both of which were excellent. The meal ended up being more expensive than I would have expected, but the flavors were solid and the service was fantastic both times.",

Most of the people were sitting out in the patio and it was just too hot and we decided to stay inside.   The lamb burger is very good. Moist and chewy and they stacked two lamb burger pieces which was really nice. Did not care for the chips. My friend ordered the same item and replaced it with a salad for a separate charge. He really enjoyed the salad. Will try that the next time that I am in the neighborhood.",

Kid Cashew has become a regular spot for me, and I have yet to try something I really didn't like. The chicken avocado sandwich and power grain salad really hit the spot when you're looking for a nice lunch (again, extra green sauce on the side!). But if you're seeking some delicious small plates for dinner, I recommend the quinoa stuffed avocado, Spanish octopus, and the mushroom risotto.  Plus, great drink deals! My coworkers and I are a big fan of the 1/2 wine bottle night, but there's something pretty much every night of the week.",

Sunday afternoon, I came here with a friend. We choose to sit on the patio since the weather was nice. Our waitress wasn't the most informative when we asked questions about the menu. However, we still enjoyed our visit.   I purchased three small plate items:  The Spicy Feta was my favorite! I love anything with jalapeno! This dish comes with a side of pita bread to dip. I was excited to try the Mac & 5-Cheese, this dish arrived piping hot.  I liked this Mac & Cheese because the ingredients included leeks and shallots, so DELISH!!! My final order was the Avacado Halve with Quinoa, which speaks for itself! This came on a bed of lettuce with chipotle sauce. I should've asked for more sauce! The items I selected were a great portion size, I left full and happy!   I look forward to coming back for happy hour! This review will be updated soon.",

It's got a rustic-industrious vibe with great outdoor seating. There's plenty of space for larger parties and sitting at the bar is a great experience.   The service is pretty average, but the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Where Kid Cashew falls short is the food. The menu is simplistic, which is a great thing, but that doesn't mean the flavors should be too. I've yet to be really wowed by anything on the menu. It's cooked well, but it's not REALLY tasty food.   The signature cocktails are a bit of a rip off. If you're a fan of lots of simple syrup and mint, you'll probably enjoy them, but at $10-12 per drink, it'll make you have buyer's remorse. Stick with beer, wine, and vodka-soda.   I like this place and you will too, but curb your expectations when it comes to the food and flavors. A firm 3/5.",

The menu has been really inconsistent. I'm all for seasonal changes, but the price increased for one item even though the dish was the exact same. For another item, the portion was smaller than usual. When I asked for extra, I was charged for extra. Some of my favorite items were taken off the menu. My appetizer and entre were served almost at the same time. I understand things are sent out as soon as they are ready, but I told the server I wanted the appetizer first. One server (who wasn't even my server) was extremely rude to me.  It's also frustrating you can't even see the current menu. Even if the menu is changing and not finalized, it really wouldn't be that hard to post the current menu on facebook. Bring back the black rice!",

I sooooooooooooooooo wanted to love it and crown it one of my new go-to spots here in Charlotte.  I came here for brunch on Sunday after church. I ordered shrimp and grits and a salad. Others in my party had the big Mac style burger, a regular burger, and shrimp and grits.  Pros-kids eat free at brunch, my coconut libation, husbands Manhattan, presentation of the dishes, decor  Cons- the shrimp and grits had no depth. It lacked richness and seemingly seasoning that even the most basic foodies or cooks would expect from this classic dish. It was presented beautifully with large shrimp, but it was disappointing everywhere else. Mine was one of 3 orders at my table, and no one was pleased with the dish. The burgers seemed to go over better with the others at the table.  I will maybe give it another try during happy hour and try some other offerings.",

This is not another TGIChilis--the menu is both adventurous and accessible, with something for anyone without reducing to the lowest common denominator.   It is a significant sign that a restaurant just a week into its life operates like one which has been in business for years--great tribute to both management and staff.   Can't wait until the weather gets warmer, when it will be possible to sit on the terrace in front--there are heaters on the terrace but I wanted the greater comfort of being inside.   There is always a time and place for Showmar's, Moe's, etc. But it is important to support restaurants like this. They have earned mine.",

    "text": "We found this place while driving around the new neighborhood one day and the description \"Mediterranean, Barbeque\" was very intriguing.  We showed up, around 5:30, and entered a very fun looking place; seriously, you need to see this one!  At 5:30 on a Friday, it was hopping, but not too full.  (By the time we finished our meal, there were people waiting for a table).   The food options are broken down into Small Plates, Sandwiches, Salads, Plates, and Sides.  Everything is served a la carte, so if you get a sandwich or plate, you should consider getting a side or two for the table (they're basically two-person servings).    I had the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and my companion had the lamb burger.  Both of these were great!  The sandwiches were both on the messy side, so be prepared for that, but I tend to find a direct correlation between messiness and great taste.   For sides, we opted for the beets and the forbidden rice & wild mushroom paella.  The beets were fantastic--seriously, we fought over them! Of note, the beets are served room temperature, which was strange at first, but works well for the dish.  We picked the rice because it has gotten very high reviews, but it honestly did not totally blow us away. It was good, and tasted exactly like what you would expect black rice and mushrooms to taste like, but just didn't blow us out of the water (to be fair, we're pretty judgemental about rice in my family).  Next time we visit, we'll get two orders of beets, skip the rice, and try a different side.  Probably our favorite thing was the tzatziki sauce, which comes on some of the sandwiches and you can get an extra side of (which you totally should) or get as an appetizer with pita bread (comes by itself or on a plate with hummus and eggplant spread).  The lamb burger comes with the tzatziki on it and, being sauce people, we ordered an extra. We ended up putting it on everything! It's super creamy (one of the thickest yogurt based sauce I've seen in the States) and heavy on the garlic in a great way!    One thing of note is that they do not have a heat lamp, so items come to the table as they are prepared, rather than waiting for everything to be ready and getting it all at once.  We ended up getting our beets first (the point at which we realized we should have gotten two orders), then our sandwiches, then the forbidden rice.  This can be kind of strange at first but our waitress explained it to us when we ordered, so it wasn't a concern.  The only real reason that this got 4 stars, instead of 5, was the price.  For two sandwiches, two sides, and no extra drinks, we paid almost $40 before tip--not totally unreasonable, but more than we prefer to spend. That being said, it was a great meal, and we'll definitely go there again!",

Yet sophisticated with chandaliers and plate settings. It was great! They really suggested sharing plates, almost like a family feel to it. I didnt know what to expect. We came on around 330 so in between lunch and dinner  The food! So we ordered the Super Grains salad which was THE BOMB DOT COM! It was romaine lettuce topped with a nice ripe avacado. It was bedazzled with quinoa raisins and a citrus with just the right amount of a lemon vineagarette type dressing. It had a sweet yet nutty taste with the quinoa. It was gone in about 5 minutes. Smh  We also ordered the lemon oregano chicken sandwhich. A complete misnomer because it was like an open salad over a miltigrain toast with a basil pesto mayo and mint leaves.  The chicken was roasted well and pulled perfectly. It was very succulent and juicy. It also blended well with the salad as the leaves werent too cold or crunchy. The tomatoes cucumbers and onions gave it a fresh taste. It was hard to tell the dressing but it was great.   Overall it was awesome! Highly recommend the above items mentioned. You wont be disappointed. The other foods on the menu also look great, will def be back. They also have a variety of wine and beers available.",

It's not crazy expensive or anything, it's just a little more than it's worth. Long way of saying there is just better places in town for the price point. That being said, if you try it out, we loved the Brussels, the white beans, and the lamb burger. I've had friends say the quality of the drinks has dropped off since it opened. Two biggest downsides, our server was super unkind. I'd call it frigid. Also, the gelato is NOT gelato. If I was 6 I would be obsessed with their version. But it is sickly sweet, gargantuan, and tastes like marshmallow fluff. Gelato is supposed to be a small quantity because it has a higher milk fat content than ice cream. This was milkshake sized. Anywho. We liked the meal overall.",

I was with a group of 4 people and we literally ordered every one of the small plates and a couple of bottles of wine. EVERYTHING was delicious. The highlights were the Mac-and-cheese, Brussels sprouts, beet salad, and the wild shrimp were Aaaamazing! We actually almost ordered a second order but were too full. The weather was chilly but warm enough to sit outside and they have an awesome patio with great atmosphere. Casual and the lighting was really nice. Best of all, when the check came we all split it equally and it was less than $25 per person. I'd definitely recommend for a group dinner on the patio! Share everything!",

We were immediately greeted with a smiling face and a table for 3 during lunch rush which was a nice surprise. We sat and within minutes, our server (Summer) brought over cold waters and was ready to take our drink order. We ordered a bottle of wine and 3 apps.   The chicken wings, spinach and feta dip and Brussell sprouts were all amazing. Hot, full of flavor and the perfect start to our meal. We then each order from the pick 2 lunch option (great deal!). They both had the burger with Mac and cheese and I had the rotisserie chicken with grilled asparagus. I can't say enough about how flavorful and well presented the food is! Every bite was like my first! The burgers were tender and packed with unique flavor. There are no words for how delicious the Mac and cheese was!   All in all, I would recommend this to any and everyone! The restaurant aesthetic, the tasty food and the wonderful service are all reasons to eat here! Can't wait to come back for dinner!",

The only issue I had was that it did not have enough food to leave me full at the end and I needed a snack soon after. My second time was my favorite...I went for lunch and did the pick 2 deal. I am gluten free dairy free so I got the chicken sandwich on a gluten-free bun with a side of stuffed avocado ....it was absolutely delicious. my waiter hooked me up, he was awesome. I had more than enough food and the price was absolutely amazing and well worth it. It is so difficult to find food to eat out that is gluten-free and dairy-free... so thank you so much for opening this spot!!!!! This place will definitely become one of the top spots in the area no doubt about it.",

Creamy dreamy risotto is tough to find in the vegan world.   They have a great wine list and cocktail menu. My husband was happy with his beer and I enjoyed a cocktail with rosemary in it.

Maybe they were frozen or maybe it was just the slow service that allowed them to sit for so long. I ended up waiting 45 minutes for my cold, tasteless meatballs. I would have been better off waiting for it to hail in September. Actually, the hail might have tasted better. All my waiter did was gossip endlessly with the hostess. I'm glad at least one of us was having a good time   Other than the horrible service and bad food, the atmosphere was sub-par. There were so few people in the restaurant that I've actually seen more people at a homeless man's funeral. I felt like I was walking into a strangers house rather than a restaurant. None of that would matter if the food tasted more complex than cardboard, but it didn't. After seeing the service and ambiance, once I tasted the food I asked for the check.   I then went next door to a lively restaurant called Bad Daddys where I had prompt service, delicious food and a great time.  Moral of the story: if you want to go to a real restaurant and have a good time, head next door to Bad Daddy's!",

Love the ambiance inside, and they have a great patio as well (unfortunately it was raining the night we went so all of the covered tables were full). Started with the duo of dips. Both of the dips were really good, but we ran out of chips and asked for warm pita bread. Tastes so much better with the warm pita. I missed the spicy feta, which was no longer on the menu. The Goat's breast milk cocktail is really different and refreshing.   I ordered a couple sides because I wanted to try everything. Didn't think the brussel sprouts or quinoa stuffed avocado had much flavor, and I was not a fan of the leeks in the mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the pulled pork panini and it was amazing!! The mustard on the sandwich really makes it and it is one of the more affordable options on the menu.",

The beef hash was super tasty, a bit greasy, but loved that it came out sizzling in a cast iron pan. The burger was definitely nothing special, reminded me of a Burger King Whopper with its iceberg lettuce and mayo sauce oozing out. With so much hype around Kid Cashew, I would've expected more but price wise, it wasn't crazy so I wasn't too bummed. Will be back but we'll focus on other dishes!",

Even though this place is a walk away, I'm not sure how many times I'll be back. I do like the concept that it is all fresh food and made to order.   Dinner:  The macaroni and cheese was excellent.  I got the scalloped potatoes. They were little fingerlings with a little bit of cheese and oil. They were a little dry and not too flavorful. I would not recommend these.   My friend got the trout. She absolutely loved it . The salad couscous that was underneath the trout was absolutely amazing.   Desert:  We got the baklava and the gelato. The baklava was way too sweet. The vanilla gelato was really strange and had a grainy texture. It was nice that it was a huge quantity, but since it wasn't good that didn't matter much.",

I highly recommend the Brussels, the octopus (tastes pretty authentically Greek) and the roasted chicken is outstanding.  This is a really nicely done fusion of Greek and more traditional American foods without being campy or cheesy.  And despite the questionable name, the Goat's Breastmilk is hands down one of the best summer drinks I've ever had. It's perfect for sharing, go ahead and get yourself a pitcher.  The atmosphere is so charming and the patio is perfect for relaxing and people watching.  You'll feel like you've gone on vacation. Go check it out!",

Per the bartenders recommendation, ordered the lamb burger. By far the juiciest most tasty lamb burger I have ever had. The food here is super fresh, not over thought, and prepared very well.

We had a couple of signature cocktails, the trout appetizer, octopus, beet salad, Greek salad, salmon, and eggplant dish.  All were excellent.  One commented \"this is the best octopus I've ever had.\"    Another observation from those with a view of the kitchen: \"that's the sign of a well-run kitchen.\"  The total bill was extremely fair.

We sat outside the patio which was surrounded with brick walls and lighting decor with wooded dining tables. The decor inside was nice and simple as I only got a glimpse while using the bathroom. We were waited on when we arrived and got drinks for the moment until we looked over the menu. I got a cocktail drink they have called Goats Milk. It had a pleasant aroma, minty and lemony with a hint of alcohol. However, service didn't go too well. After we received our drinks our waitress never came back to check up on us or ask if everything was all good. We wanted to eat as well and waited patiently for our server to come. While our waitress served the other guests in front of us we had a feeling we weren't going to get served since the other guest after us had already gotten their food. After awhile waiting we decided not to eat and leave. But then the server never came around to give us our check so being hungry and aggravated already, I pulled out my credit card and started tapping the table in order for them to notice us. We left for the night and was disappointed by the bad service given. Most likely, we will not return to this restaurant.",

We arrived right before the crowd came which was a good thing. Once the restaurant picked up a bit it got very loud. I realized I was yelling across the table.  Aside from all that... I thought the service was great. Very polite, knowledgeable, and professional.  The drinks are made from fresh ingredients which we so refreshing. I had the strawberry basil (a strawberry mule) which is now one of my all time favorite drinks. We decided to do a few small plates to share. We started off with the hummus. It came with pita slices and some sort of bread. The hummus was so full of flavor. You get a good bit of hummus for the amount of pita and bread you are given. Next was the octopus and the shrimps. Both very rich in flavors and very delicious. The octopus was a decent amount of food. The shrimp come only four shrimp to an order so the are a bit of a tease.  I will be coming back to have more drinks and try out different food options. I will make an effort to come before the crowds so I can actually hear the people in my party.",

    "text": "Food for four. So, three of my friends have been here before and they really, really liked it. I suggested I might try it some time and they decided no time like the present. It was raining when we got there, so that must have dampened the crowd. We were able to be seated right away. Once we were seated and we had our drinks, one of the cons of this place was immediately evident, the table for four is really better suited for two. With our food arriving, and the drinks, it soon became too crowded. The menu set up encourages what they call small plates to accompany the main plate. Think of it as sides. I got the lamb gyro plate. It was the best gyro I've had in some time. I came with some potato chips. As a small plate, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. Now I'm not a fan of baked macaroni and I do like the smaller elbow macaroni, but they tried. It's not the best I've had but it certainly isn't the worst. Two of my friends also ordered their own macaroni- they love it. I think I'm a little more discriminating in my macaroni tastes, so, good but not the best. Also sampled were the meatballs, they had garlic and cumin, it seemed and were pretty good. My friends loved the meal and I really enjoyed mine as well. Service was excellent, couldn't have asked be better service, excellent and quick and efficient as well as very pleasant. Sorry, I don't know her name, I'm almost deaf and didn't look for a name tag. There is an option of inside dining or out on the veranda overlooking East Blvd. Being a bit rainy and humid, we opted for inside dining. Very clean, and a different feel than most restaurants. Hard to define, but I liked it, but not the teeny, tiny tables. Maybe be more concerned with customers being more comfortable than worrying about your bottom line. That said, it was a positive experience and I'd go back again. The price is not out of line. We got there a little early, so the small plates were reduced a bit. My meal ran around 21 dollars including my sweet tea, with refill. I was completely satisfied and enjoyed both the meal and the new experience. Didn't notice any of the bothersome music that most restaurants think they have to play these days and with the rain outside, it was almost cozy. Yes, I'd go back and have no reservations or recommending this place to someone that wants a good meal, in a casual surrounding, and not breaking the bank. Clean and excellent service. I understand this place is new and if they keep up the good food and service, I think they'll do very well indeed. I do hope they get larger tables though, kinda tight for four. That's why I gave only four stars instead of five, really didn't like the tight fit.",

Went back yesterday for lunch and order 4 small plates, the server didn't write our order down and it came out wrong. Our server Louisa had no personality towards us and again, she got the order wrong and didn't apologize when we asked for it to be fixed. The cilantro chicken skewers are great and the Mac and cheese is also great but service really needs work",

We took a table outside because it was just as warm inside and much, much noisier. Staff accommodated our request to sit under a fan. Were seated within 20 minutes as forecast, which was much appreciated. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, at least on weekends. Very busy and well staffed. Very reasonably priced. Was my wife's third visit and my first and as Arnold would say we'll be baahhhk!.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to Yelp Restaurant week and had picked out all the places I was going to go.  Instead I got stick that week and really didn't move from the couch too much. I still wasn't feeling 100% at the end of the week, but I'd felt so cooped up we decided to hit up one of the Yelp restaurants on the list: Kid Cashew.  Some of our friends live near the restaurant so we met up with them at an off time: 3 pm. I didn't want to deal with crowds or craziness while I wasn't feeling my best and this time was perfect. There were a decent amount of people there, but by no means was it packed.  We ordered the butternut squash hummus to start. You know that drooling emoji? Yeah. Go ahead and insert that here. I've been thinking about that hummus a decent amount since then. I highly recommend it. I ordered the chicken gyro, my boyfriend ordered the lamb gyro, my friends ordered the veggie gyro and the avocado. All looked amazing. Mine - the chicken gyro - was insanely messy to eat, but still yummy. I didn't love the couple of bones I found in it, but I did know it was pulled chicken so I'm honestly not sure what I expected. The chips were also delightful. We ordered brussel sprouts which were also pretty delicious. Honestly though, with an appetizer and the meal, we didn't need the side. I was super full and my boyfriend and I had split the appetizer and side, but it honestly was just too full to finish them.  I can't wait to go back and sit on their patio! The weather was gross when we went, but I have high hopes for when the weather turns I want to go back. Plus, since their menu is seasonal I'll be interested in going back - even at full price. I've actually been thinking about that hummus since I went so....you know I'll be back to try more.",

This quaint restaurant was perfect for chatting, eating, and drinking (check out the weekday specials online before you go). On the rainy Wednesday night we ate here, it was pretty empty inside, besides the several servers waiting by the bar to take orders. I got the rotisserie chicken sandwich and my tastebuds were not disappointed! Downside to thos restaurant is that it is very crowded with tables and booths pushed very close to one another. We sat on the far wall booth/table line and after dinner the hostess sat couples on both sides of us. When I say my attention span shrank, I am not exaggerating. I would definately check it out again, but ask to be sat in another area of the restaurant.   Pro Tip- parking is located in a small lot next to the restaurant, on the other side of Shomars. Be sure to check the signs in the lot to ensure you are in the right lot and won't risk getting towed.",

The lamb burger is excellent and their sides are always fresh. Their serving portions are also good. Enough to be filling and you feel as if you got a great deal for your money every time.

On Mondays, they have $6 martinis (3 to choose from), which is a great deal and very tasty. I ordered the MacDaddy burger which was very flavorful, juicy, and definitely a great deal for Burger Week.  I was disappointed with the amount of chips I received as a side...I think I counted a total of less than 10 kettle chips on my plate.  Also, the Burger Week website advertised a special $6 bourbon cocktail at Kid Cashew.  When we asked the bartender and manager about this, they said they weren't initially aware of this and would have it available later in the week.  I think it would have been nice to have been offered some kind of substitute for this oversight.  All in all, the burger was really good, so I will go back to Kid Cashew to give it another try in the future.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to check out Kid Cashew for a while and I had the opportunity to attend Brunch this past Saturday. Loved the decor and the look of the outside patio. I was there for a Bachelorette Brunch and we had a group of 9. The restaurant was busy but it wasn't slammed. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was great. Everyone else at the table ordered Carafes of Mimosas which i was told were delish. I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered the Crab Cake Benedict after asking for a recommendation b/t that and the Shrimp and Grits. Food came out in a somewhat reasonable time for a large table.   My Crab Cake Benedict was just OK...I really hate to say that b/c I am usually ok with whatever, and maybe I had built up the experience in my head a little, but it wasn't anything special. It lacked seasoning. I asked for salt and pepper (and was given a look) and that helped some. Also the yoke had cooked a little more that I would have liked but that probably had more to do with we were being proper and waiting for everyone's food to arrive and one took a few mins longer than the rest of the table. The Bachelorette ordered the French toast and it was pretty close to burnt.   My biggest disappointment with my experience at Kid Cashew was the service. Our server was not very friendly and almost seemed annoyed to be there or maybe it was that she had a party of nine...I don't know. She got snippy with a few of us, gave me a look when I asked for salt and pepper and I don't think she smiled the entire time. Everyone at the table but myself shared the mimosa carafe's, they brought out wine glasses for the rest of the table but forgot one. She was asked for another glass. Someone else asked not realizing it had already been mentioned. Her response was \"I KNOW!\" As we walked out everyone had a comment about how unpleasant she was. I don't know that being a server is this particular person's calling.   Overall I left feeling Meh. At some point I will give it another try but I won't be running back.",

    "text": "How glad I am to have spent my Valentine's Day lunch here at Kid Cashew. :)  First off, interesting name! I wonder why they named the restaurant this. I would have never guessed that they served Mediterranean and BBQ but hey- I\"m not complaining.  The menu is pretty simple. They have small plates, salads (you can add protein), sandwiches, from the farmer and from the butcher. We decided to get something from the farm. I was so torn between the brussels sprouts and the mac n cheese. I am SO happy that we decided to get mac n cheese because it was the best mac n cheese I have ever had. That is coming from a girl who doesn't even like that dish that much to begin with. I would eat that everyday.   As far as entrees, they do primarily family style. I love that because I can have a little bit of everything. My friend and I decided on a half chicken ($9) and 1/2 lb pork shoulder ($12.50). I don't say this about chicken often, but it was cooked perfectly! Same with the pork shoulder. It had the perfect ratio of fat to meat and cutting it was like cutting into butter. My favorite part of the meal was the sauces. We were able to choose 2 sauces because we ordered 2 different proteins. We got the cilantro (something) and harissa.  I don't know why I'm blanking right now but both were GREAT!  I feel like I'm blabbing because I blab when I'm excited. This place may be new but it is definitely worth trying. They know what's up. I forgot the name of my server, but he was great. He gave great recommendations and knew how to talk to customers. The people up at the front were incredible as well. I can't wait to come back here to try other dishes.   --End of blabbing.",

Surprisingly packed for a Tuesday and a rainy one at that.  We made reservations because we were a large group and the service was quick and pleasant.   Started with meatballs and the pita with spinach dip (yummy!).  I had the chicken and avocado sandwich which was great! Someone else had a burger and another had the portobello sandwich, both were happy. Those who had the salmon liked it, and even the steak (although they complained the portions were a bit small).  Overall the food tasted very fresh and I like that they use local ingredients. Will definitely be back, would love to sit on the patio next time though!",

I do know this place is brighter and has way more character than anything in this place before. Ample outdoor dining places as well. There are no freezers in the restaurant. Everything is fresh and there is no hot plate. When it's done it will come to your table. They timed our lunch well. We started with the dip trio of hummus, tasziki, and a spicy feta which has feta whipped with jalapeno. This was really tasty on the toast and pita wedges.   For lunch I had the half chicken which I really had to order after watching 6 of them spinning on the rotisserie looking scrumptious. It was juicy and delicious with nice spice on the skin. I was told I had to try the Brussels sprouts and I was not disappointed as they were roasted to perfection with a nice crispness.   Looked like they had small few nice wine choices as well. Maybe on my next visit. Which will be soon.",

Very few tables were filled but by 6:30, the place was absolutely packed. The setup of the restaurant is conducive to sharing and family style eating. We ordered a bunch of items. Smoked trout-liked by everyone at the table but it wasn't for me, just not my thing. We had the Forbidden Rice, Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Beets, Shrimp App, the Smashed Potatoes and a whole chicken, the lamb and pork shoulder from the Butcher. (Geez that's a lot to type and yes, it was a lot of food).  Make sure you select one of the sauces offered-they were delicious. Everything was delightful with the exception of the potatoes. They were just ok. We shared everything and everyone had plenty to eat with lots of leftovers.  For dessert, we had the baklava and vanilla gelato.  The place is kid friendly which adds to the loudness of the place. Definitely go with 4 or so people so that you can order a bunch of items and sample. They don't take reservations although there didn't seem to be much of a wait. Outdoor patio looks great for when it warms up.  I would recommend this place and would return to try some other items and some of their specialty cocktails.",

I called and was told they would be happy to accommodate our small Chihuahua family member on the outside seating area. We are very happy that we went. The food is delicious, the service was fantastic, and the luncheon menu is very reasonably priced. I completely enjoyed the roast lamb with a side of Mac & cheese, with a local craft brew draft, and my bride chose the arugula red & gold salad with sliced roast lamb. We are in the area dodging Hurricane Florence and if they are open again before we leave for home we will certainly return for their dinner menu. This is certainly among the top two or three dining experiences we have enjoyed in at least the last several years. Highly recommended by two who know good food and great service.",

    "text": "Let me start of by saying I would come back here for the pita alone. Chewy, doughy and smoky like they'd been toasted over wood fire - yum. We had an early dinner on a Monday and we were joking we were early birds. The restaurant was empty aside from one other couple at 4pm. Yikes. We had our doubts but the food was great! Our server was really engaging and gave us great recommendations. We split the trio of dips - if you order just one, get the feta. I liked the feta the most, the tzatziki second best and the hummus the least. The hummus is made with a black chickpea with a thicker husk so it is chunky. Good as a spread, but not your traditional smooth hummus I've come to expect. We split the pulled chicken sandwich and the white beans for our meal. I want to know where they get their breads b/c they're so good. The sandwich is big and definitely enough to share. The white beans come warm in a tomato sauce that you will finish to the last drop; it's that good. For drinks, I tried the mule with fig - super sweet; I wouldn't order this again and I love sweets. Next time, I'm going to try the cucumber cocktail. Parking wasn't an issue because we came at a slow time but they only have a small lot next door. Overall, I would come here again!",

    "text": "I went to Kid Cashew over the weekend and was delightfully surprised. This east blvd spot has been a hard location for restaurants to stick, but I have a feeling that Kid Cashew is here to stay. Coming from NYC, I had a strict loyalty to Pio Pio because of my love for Peruvian chicken. After trying the chicken from Kid Cashew, it is safe to say I have officially jumped ship. The chicken was tender and juicy. The avocado quinoa chicken salad was to die for. I literally could eat that every day! Although intrigued by the lamb burger and tapas, we kept it pretty low key with the signature dishes that our server recommended.  Which only means, I'll be back to try everything. Although it was a weirdly warm January night, it's not warm enough to go outside. I cannot wait for the weather to change and check out the outdoor space. This Mediterranean menu seems like the perfect compliment to an outdoor eating fare. I would recommend this place for a casual night with friends, a date, or a great spot to show the family some of the new exciting places Charlotte has to offer. Favorite Drink: Strawberry Basil-super fresh and dangerous (doesn't taste like one drop of alcohol is in it)",

The service is awesome with the staff taking care of us well. The staff is very knowledgeable in terms of the food or drinks being served. Don't miss their featured drink, the goats breast milk, it's worth the try. From the small plates , the 3 dip with bread is ok. Nothing amazing but will recommend a try. The feta and baked spinach is definitely recommended. From the sandwiches the lemon-oregano chicken is a treat to the taste buds and so is the from the butcher half chicken. These two are amazingly tasty. The Brussels sprouts from the farmers were good and should be tried though the wood fried portobello mushroom could be given a miss. The deserts baklava and sundae were very tasty as well. All in all a must go restaurant.",

Our server was actually quite good explaining the menu, being attentive as much as possible. Yes there were lulls in the service but I would attribute that to overall staffing levels. If you want your own personal entree to come at the same time.. forget it. Your side will come and then your protein will come 10 min later. And this varies for each person at the table. The food reviews at the table were also mixed. After I received the salmon for the second time (first time rushed from the kitchen and undercooked) it was good but nothing special. The trout was also dull. The whole chicken & lamb burger received thumbs up. Brussels, mac & cheese - although good, nothing special. Conclusion: Like any \"Kid\" this one has some maturing to do.",

Our server was great and was super helpful with describing the menu. Everything is family style so my friend and I decided to each get our own small plate and then split a second small plate. I got the Chargrilled Spanish Octopus. It came cut up unlike some of the pictures i had seen on here. It also did not have the crispy garlic or gigantic beans that were listed with it on the menu. This was highly disappointing because while the octopus alone was good I would have liked that have something else on the plate as well. The octopus was cooked almost to perfection. I loved the smoky flavor, but it was covered a bit too much oil for my taste. My friend got the Wild-Gulf Shrimp. The garlic butter that it comes in is delicious. She seemed very happy with how the shrimp were cooked. Once done with the shrimp our waitress asked if we would like some pita to dip in the garlic butter. We obviously said yes. I could have eaten a pound of the warm pita with the garlic butter but I had some self control to stop. Lastly we split the Mac & Five-Cheese Gratin with leeks and shallots. I don't know if the leeks and shallots weren't in there or i just didn't notice them but this Mac and cheese was amazing. I love Mac and Cheese that has been broiled and has a nice crispy top. It was a large bowl so i was happy that we split this. All and all this is a cool spot that has good food. My only real complaint is that my octopus didn't come with everything listed which i've seen other reviews have issues with as well. My advice is go in and split stuff so you can try a bunch of things. That's what this restaurant was made for.",

Now I know this place just opened and I'm not one to complain about noise, but it was so freaking loud my ears were ringing & I could barely even here what the waiter was saying. Anywayyyy I really wanted this place to be good, the menu looks creative but all together it's all bland. The chargrilled octupus was dry overcooked and lacked any flavor. I dont understand the fingerling potatoes, all it is is little baked potatoes chopped up dry Bacon and served with an egg on top. The brussel sprouts we're yummy. The grilled shrimp was the best of the meal we used the sauce that came with it and dipped the octupus and potatoes in it since they were so bland. The salmon was grilled to perfection but it's served with bland Cold quinoa. Overall the Brussels,shrimp and salmon were tasty. The restaurant did not offer that one really good item that hit the stop that would make you want to come back.",

I asked about the pita bread but was told they have changed the menu and now only serve pita chips (even though they didn't actually change the menu or tell us this when we ordered it). My son won't eat the chips so I asked for a piece of pita bread since the kids pizza is pita bread pizza. The waitress refused so I asked to see the manager who said no problem and brought us pita. The waitress could have fixed the problem easily but instead made it awkward and uncomfortable. My daughter's pizza came out without tomatoes and when I asked about that the waitress says it was because I ordered \"plain\" as opposed to the chicken pizza... after we were finished eating lunch she didn't clear our plates and brought the ice cream to our table full of dirty plates and cutlery. Waters were never once filled. My husband was hoping to order a beer but she never came around to take more orders. I got the avocado toast and the the egg was cold and hard on top. Really not a pleasant experience - especially as this was Father's Day! Won't be coming back.",

The atmosphere is fun and some dishes decent, but it's a complete misrepresentation that they bill themselves as Mediterranean. Alas, most new \"ethic\" restaurants opening in Charlotte offer only whitewashed cuisines, but become popular anyway because of a fun atmosphere (I'm looking at you CO). I think Charlotteans should be given more credit for their ability to embrace a bit more authenticity.",

The drinks were delicious, even though we had to remind several servers that we ordered them and they took a long time to arrive.  We ordered several food items and we never received 2 of them.  The food was just okay to good; as expected.  They do not provide serving utensils; which makes no sense since this is a tapas/family style restaurant.  The tables do not provide enough room for the plates/drinks.  They would not let us keep a copy of the menu; therefore we felt obligated to keep with our original drink order for the refills and couldn't review the menu for more food selections/reviewing what we ordered.  Every time one of us got up to use the restroom, someone would come by trying to take the empty chair.  We got the pork and it was very fatty.  The greek salad was good.  The octopus was not the best.    Overall, they have some work to do before we will return; but with all the other restaurants in Charlotte, the likelihood of us returning is very very low.  The atmosphere/decor is very nice.",

I was excited someone finally re did the place. The inside is eclectic, funky, & rustic. I loved the long farm table we sat at in the front next to the door. The lighting was kinda too bright or maybe I'm just used to eating in the dark at other places. The drinks are delicious and a good price. I had a Rosemary which was basically a Moscow mule with rosemary but so good! My friend had an actual Moscow mule - still good. And my other girl friend had the basil - also yummy. The drinks were pretty strong because i caught a buzz after just one. I ordered the mac & cheese which was good because of the burnt cheese on top. My gf ordered a half chicken which was juicy but flavor was okay. My other gf ordered the eggplant something which was also good! Overall a nice place for drinks !",

All were good not great, but didn't bring nearly enough bread. Then it was an extra $2 for more bread. Not a bid deal, but definitely a little tacky. I got pork with a side of Brussels sprouts, my wife got a gyro. Pork was good not great, but the sprouts were horribly undercooked. Really disappointed because they really aren't that hard to prepare and are amazing when done well. We didn't think the Gyro was lamb... tasted like pork and unlike any Gyro we had ever had. Very little flavor. Overall all the prices were a la cart and overpriced. If it was $12 s plate I would have said I liked it. But for $20+ per plate, to get a subpar meal.. I do not recommend. I was also charged 25% more than I should have been for my whiskey as the bartender or waitress did not understand my order, but didn't care to complain and just wanted to go.",

I went back for a repeat and it was a nightmare. I ordered the pork shoulder and sprouts again. I was advised since it was Sunday, I could only order potato chips as a side with the pork shoulder!?  Random, but I agreed. Our meal came and I was served a pork sandwich with crumbs of potato chips. It was ONLY AFTER the food arrived the server told me the shoulder wasn't avail and no longer on the menu.  She said it's \"been removed from the menu,  so I shouldn't have ordered it.\"  She offered to remove the pork from the bill. Didn't offer anything else.  I said, \"I'm gonna need a menu since I came for lunch and my husband is eating.\"  5 mins later she brings a menu. I pick something else and I waited 25 more minutes for mediocre, cold shrimp and grits. My husband finished his meal before my second meal arrived. We were charged for all of it. A manager never came by. Needless to say, we won't be back. Terrible service. Terrible menu.",

Comfy patio seating.   We decided to check it out, because Yelp said they're dog friendly. We got a lot of bizarre and irritated looks from the staff by bringing our pups on the patio. So I'd leave your furry friends at home for this one.   Food was pretty good. Nothing that really made me go \"Oooh\" but not a bad meal. The menu definitely pumped me up. We tried the octopus (a bit too chewy to eat), the Brussel sprouts (pretty good!), the Greek salad (lots of onions...but okay to share), the potato gratin (definitely again, too many onions. Maybe 3 fingerlings in a bowl of cheesy onions), the open face chicken sandwich (our server told us it's more of a chicken salad - and it was- so don't expect a breast of chicken or normal sandwich) and a gelato sundae (really disappointing.. they must have forgotten it because it came out melted and the server kinda shrugged it off when we asked).   Drinks? Skip. We tried three (Rosemary, basil, and goat breast milk) - they all were just different variations of each other. Shoulda gone with wine - the list was pretty good.   Service was mediocre and slow. Kinda careless. water refills were pretty scarce (maybe why similar hip restaurants leave bottles on the table?). Drinks took a while to get out. Server messed up a few of our orders and kinda questioned us on it. Oh well. Maybe it's just an off night. Might go back to try the butcher meat - but would probably just order it to go.",

For a cocktail I ordered the Fig Mule, it was so disappointing. I wanted to like but ended up not even finishing it. The food, was a underwhelming. The roasted beets, were good but seriously the smallest portion of tapas I have ever seen. The Forbidden Rice was definitely my favorite. It was warm, earthy and savory - well done. We also ordered the lamb, which is what our server suggested given our other items (initially we were going to get the roasted chicken). I am glad that we got the lamb. All the flavors worked well but I wasn't \"wowed\". We then ordered the sundae and it was also just OK. I thought it was a bit tart but my friend loved it, he finished it on his own.

I ordered the beef hash which was onions, peppers, potatoes, beef and an easy egg. I love a good hash and this is definitely one of my top favorites. There is also a lunch menu that you can choose from. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro which was also delicious and a top favorite menu item of mine. The staff is also very prompt and attentive. Always checking up on us and making sure drinks are filled (which is one of my pet peeves when the service staff doesn't). The restaurant itself is very eclectic and such a fun atmosphere.

The drink is basically ouzo, amaretto, mint and some sort of lemon mixer, in a word succulent and perfect for summer. I tried the lamb burger entree and it was filling for 12.50. The lamb had a savory taste with the onion jam but was a little too full of onion. Next time i would say pass on onions, but then again I am not a fan of that veggie. The fingerling potato side was very good. We shared Brussels sprouts which were good with a nutty taste. I think the only reason I dropped a star is the lack of parking situation. I had to go over to a neighborhood and walk back to kid cashew.",

We decided to order a few things from the small plates menu.. The Brussels sprout, the shrimps and black rice paella w/o the mushrooms. I'm fond of everything except the black rice. First time I ever have black rice.. But I love anything that have the word paella in it. So I figure it's worth a try.. But it's just have a bitter taste to it. Funny I tripping about the bitterness of it yet I'm ok with the Brussels sprout. I'm freak when it comes to the sprouts. And it's on point here. Have a hint of lemon to it. Cook to perfection.. The shrimps sits in a nice, light cream sauce. Love it. And I order the \"basil\" drink. Not sure what's in it. But I'm a fan. I'm coming back..",

    "text": "Came in on a Thursday evening as a party of two. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at an outdoor table on the patio as requested. The inside was packed and the noise level was extremely high, a level that would make it nearly impossible to have a conversation without yelling. Decor was adorable and unique. A friendly gentleman promptly came to our table to fill our water glasses and had a brief conversation with us.   Shortly after our waitress arrived to discuss the drink menu, advised us that she was extremely knowledgable about wine if we needed suggestions and told us what her favorites were. She then departed and stated she would return take our drink order. About ten minutes passed until she came back. Then another fifteen before we received them by another waitress. This was the 25 minute mark before even getting drinks, which I will say the Rosemary cocktail was delicious.   Then skip to around 45-50 minutes after being seated...this was when our order was finally taken. The waitress passed by our table multiple times to remove plates, take orders, bring new drinks, place/pick-up checks, have lengthy conversations, etc. at every other table around us. The waitress never once apologized for not coming to check in or to inform us she would be with us shortly. I understand tapas and the timeline is normally a little extended in between dishes so you can enjoy your food, etc. which is fine. What is not fine is when you never even get to place an order for nearly an hour.   We were frustrated by the time the waitress came for our orders so we only ended up ordering three small plates. Spinach and feta, hummus, and octopus. All were mediocre and unfortunately not worth the wasted time. I still much prefer Dandelion Market in the area for tapas. This was such a horrible customer service experience that we will not be returning to try again. There is no reason to have such an extended period of time for people to wait, especially without notification of a possible reason why. If this is a staffing issue, I suggest management bulks up the employee count or at least train them to be communicative. We've dined in many restaurants in many cities that have consistently packed dining rooms and never experienced timelines like this. Hate to have to give a poor review, we really wanted to like this place!",

We wanted to sit at the bar, but the staff was hanging out there, so the hostess told us she'd have to see if they would move. Sorry to put you out!   The staff moved, but the entire time we were there, they were moving chairs and tables around us, and there was a loud banging sound coming from the back. Also, the bar had a chunk out of it that my friend kept scraping her skin on, so she had to keep adjusting how she sat.  The food was okay. We got the octopus and, at the bartender's strong suggestion, the spinach and feta dip. Both were just fair.  Two strikes and you're out... I'm just not drinking the Kool-Aid with this place.",

Each dish is jam packed with fresh, flavorful ingredients as well as unique, super tasty cocktails! The service is amazing here. The doctor is really trendy, with a beautiful rustic interior and a great patio space outside. My favorite cocktail is the Blueberry cocktail, made with vodka, rosemary, lemon zest and soda. My favorite appetizer style tapa is the Mac N Cheese Gratin, a savory five-cheese blend mixed with shallots and leeks = explosion of goodness in your mouth. The cheese is still bubbling in the skillet when they serve it to you! And my favorite dessert here is the Vanilla Gelato Sundae, with chocolate and caramel sauce, pistachios, and Heath crumbles -- this is what heaven tastes like, surely!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this place didn't quite live up to all the hype for me in terms of food. The atmosphere is top notch - with beautiful wooden tables, a well decorated bar and chandeliers on the inside, and a wide, expansive wooden patio outside, which will be a hit come summer.  Our server wasn't all that great and there were some mishaps which contributed to a not stellar all around experience. Maybe I'll give it another try in a few months. My husband and I both had the goat's breastmilk to start, which was really good. The licorice flavored liquor with a touch of honey is genius. We were sitting out on the beautiful patio on a Friday afternoon, enjoying the warm spring air. For food, we started with the mac n' cheese, beets, and eggplant dip with pita bread. We disclosed to the waiter that I'm allergic to nuts, so we were able to get the beets without pistachios. However, there was no mentioning of pine nuts being in the eggplant dip, and I guess he wasn't thinking and brought out the eggplant dip. Luckily, I spotted them before eating it so we were able to switch it to tzatziki but it would have been nice if the waiter knew the menu a little better and would have known not to bring out the eggplant dip in the first place. The tzatziki was a little too oily. The mac n cheese was very good, probably my favorite of the three. The beets were just okay - pretty plain and not a big serving for $7. The most disappointing though, was the lamb burger, which we were really looking forward to because we were getting really hungry after these smaller bites. The burger comes out pretty impressive looking - two patties with caramelized onions on top. However, when we cut in, the meat almost looked raw - definitely not cooked enough. We weren't asked how we wanted it cooked, and I think the waiter could have said \"It's usually cooked medium, is that okay with you?\" Although, this one was more medium rare. We sent it back and got our check. So unfortunately, didn't get to try the lamb burger!",

I loved that they have a lunch option where you can pick 2 items--it allowed me to try multiple things which was great. I picked the Quinoa stuffed acocado and chicken avocado sandwich! The stuffed avocado was good, but actually not as good as I was hoping for. I got tired of it quick and it was spicier than I expected. I've had better stuffed avocados elsewhere. I really liked the chicken avocado sandwich though! The bread was SO good--seemed like fresh homemade multi-grain. Between my 2 items, I'd definitely go with the sandwich!   The service here was a bit slow and any meat addition to a salad was an extra $5 which seems like a lot to me. You quickly pay for a $16 salad instead of $11 which I personally don't think is worth it. I wish a choice of meat would just be included. Aside from that, this can be a fun place to stop if you're looking for fresh food in a cute atmosphere.",

If the weather is agreeable, I'd recommend giving their outdoor seating a try.  I ended up getting their version of the 'Big Mac' burger which was very good, although we were disappointed not to find any french fries on the menu at all, because what's a great burger without some french fries?

    "text": "I'm back to continue raving about what is my favorite regular spot in the QC! Their menu is constantly rotating and always fresh. The number of vegan and vegetarian options is always high and easy to discern on the menu. This spot is perfect for date night, a group dinner, or brunch. Anything, really! It's big enough that you don't really need a reservation either (there's always the bar if it's too busy). Their waiters are very kind and fun to interact with. I highly recommend exploring their cocktail menus and also their desserts (that sundae, though...).",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times, but unfortunately this review is based off the most recent time. Will elaborate pros and cons.  Pros - half off bottle of wine on Tuesdays, yes please.   Ease of getting a table, never had an issue with this as they have lots inside and outside. As it's February, there was one couple enjoying the heated outdoor patio, but no one else was brave enough. They were probably visiting from the North. ;)  Ambiance and decor - super cute, homey, rustic, clean and charming. Even the patio is cute, which is part of why I loved coming here.  Cons - food quality. It's really gone downhill (in the past maybe year?). It used to seem as if it was fresh, but now it seems it's from Sysco, yes I said it. This is not what happened around a year and a half ago when it all seemed like it was fresh.  Octopus - probably the worst I've ever had, and I love octopus. It was so overcooked it was like rubber to chew. And it was cold. Maybe the waitress let it sit too long? It was actually terrible and we couldn't even finish it.  Meatballs - great flavor with a stroganoff type sauce, but they didn't seem fresh and my partner could only stomach one (and he usually loves meatballs, so that was weird). We ended up taking 3 home, they might be better round 2.  Lamb burger - good flavor in the lamb, but it's not exactly a lamb patty. I think it's the traditional lamb you get by shaving off the rotisserie, but it was two large chunks. I guess I expected them to make the patties by hand as most nice restaurants that serve this dish, but not so much. The meat flavor was just as you'd expect from a Greek restaurant - just served in a different way than in pita etc. There was also much too much tzatziki sauce so the patties kept slipping off with each bite. It was a sandwich that you constantly move the insides around to make sure each bite is flavorful and then at the end you've got a whole lot of some things and none of the other ie: bread to meat ratio.   Beat shared plate (same as salad minus arugula) - they just tasted old, and not fresh. I knew the mandarin oranges would be from a can because that's how they come, but with the old beets I just wasn't into it. It seemed like it had been sitting in my frig for 4 days and I was just getting to it. The cheese and nuts were oversold on the menu too, as it was a dab of cheese and a few sprinkled nuts. I feel like I ordered this dish in 2016 and it wow'd me and the other night it was just a chore to eat. We only finished it because I swear I could hear my mom saying, \"finish your veggies.\"   Half avocado in quinoa - Ok this dish was worth it! It was a $3 up-charge with the lamb burger. I honestly should have gotten the full and not everything else. Fortunately with a \"half avocado\" they can't give you a low budget alternative, and it showed. Yum, and thank you. Great sauce and flavor, even if it was basic shredded lettuce.  *My rating is not based on how terrible the service was, the food earned all 3 stars and nothing more. Here we go. Service - where to begin? This is a long story so just give up now if you have somewhere to be and skip Kid Cashew...  Firstly, my partner was literally flying in this night as we'd been across the country from one another the past few days so we decided to meet and have a date. He landed at 7 so we decided to meet at 7:30 knowing he'd be later so I could order and have it ready when we arrived. We were both starving anyway. So I arrive, waitress tells me about the half off wine, and then says \"I see your other person isn't here so I'll be back when they are to get your order.\" I think, OK well surely she'll swing back by after 10 mins of me sitting here alone with my water and ask if I'm ready anyway. Nope. I basically wave at her from across the room (she is literally just standing around talking to another staff member bc she thinks she has nothing to do). She comes over and I tell her I'd like to order. Surprised she gets out the notepad.  I order the lamb burger, ask if I can get asparagus as the side. \"No.\" Um, no? Like not even for an up-charge? Not even, \"no I'm sorry we can't?\" \"No, just the sides listed.\" Ok, well then I'll get the avocado (thank goodness I did). She then closes her notebook and says, \"you want me to pick up these dishes since this person isn't coming?\" What?! No, firstly, I'm not done ordering and secondly they are coming! She looks at me like I'm crazy and opens her notebook again so I order the rest. Well that was awkward. He finally arrives, a few minutes before the food arrives, but the waitress doesn't come back. She finally comes with the food and drops is. Not even an acknowledgement to him to say \"hi, welcome\" etc anything. She never asks if we want wine or any drinks besides water (or before) and just drops the food and heads back off.  In total, I saw her 4 times total and it wasn't pleasant.   Given the experience, we probably won't be back.",

It was a beautiful day so we just sat on the patio which was nice. If you're looking for a lamb burger in Charlotte this is the place to be. The burger is not just one of the best lamb burgers in Charlotte, it's one of the the best burgers in general so I'd go back just to get it. I also got some mac and cheese which was just ok. All in all I'd visit again for the burger.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to try Kid Cashew for a while,  and finally decided to go Saturday for a late lunch. Craft cocktails are around $13, the grill items are around $17, most burgers/sandwiches are around $11, and the \"small plates\" (which are each the equivalent of a small appetizer for two people) run from $6 to $12 (pricey for portions on those). I originally thought of getting a few small plates to make up my lunch but decided for the price I was better off just getting a main dish.  We ended up getting two small plates (the Cast Iron Mac & Cheese and the Grilled Beets), the Lamb Burger (with kettle chips), the Lamb Gyro (upgraded the side to a quinoa stuffed half avocado for $3) and we shared a Big Fig Newton craft cocktail. We saw some neighboring tables order a few items we had considered.   Honestly, nothing blew us away. In fact, we both agreed that every item we tried, we had other places in mind (locally) that made something similar that we enjoyed better (sometimes for better prices too).   Service was friendly and attentive, but at the end of the day we both agreed we were glad we tried it but we didn't feel like we would likely return. There's just too many great food places in Charlotte to settle for average.",

    "text": "I've actually been really bad about going to try new places since moving to Charlotte in 2017. Kid Cashew is a place that had been on my list ever since seeing the name on the sign when I was headed to Lebowski's for trivia.  Kid Cashew. First, I thought it sounded like an Asian restaurant, not Mediterranean. I guess because of the cashew? I don't know. Second, I was 99% sure that was the name of a rapper. Both guesses were incorrect, but finally getting to Kid Cashew was the correct decision.  We went on a really nice Friday evening and were able to sit outside and enjoy the weather. We ordered a nice crisp bottle of Sauvignon Blanc - Brancott Estate (NZ) to start. Hadn't ever had that before but it fit the low 80's and sunny weather perfectly. Not super sweet, but enough to party.  We started off with a few dishes - the spicy feta and hummus, wood fire grilled octopus, and the meatball au poivre.   First, the spicy feta was IN.CRE.DI.BLE. I figured it would just be feta with a little flair of spice. Nope. There was some serious kick in there. Like if you ate 5 consecutive bites you would actually start to feel some burn. Loved it. I'm not a huge hummus fan, but my girlfriend seemed to enjoy that as well. They had no problem reloading us with pita when we ran out, and it came out hot and fresh.   The meatball au poivre with the cognac peppercorn gravy. Yum. I've always said gravy is one of my favorite food groups and this gravy delivered in a big way. The meatballs were moist and tender and gave you more of a subtle au poivre feel as opposed to the peppercorns forming a crust. Damn good, though.  I had heard a ton about the octopus at Kid Cashew so we obviously had to get it. I thought the octopus was pretty good. I don't know what it is, but something is sort of offputting by laying a protein (or anything, really) into a pool of olive oil. I get it's pretty, but I'm just not a huge fan. Also, they did give us a lemon slice but it could have taken another hit of acid before getting to the table. I'd probably give it 3.5/5.  On to the mains. I can't speak to the fish my girlfriend got as her entree, but the quinoa under it was the best I've ever had.   I was struggling between the lamb burger and the Big Mac Daddy, but eventually went with the latter. Now, I've definitely had my fair share of big mac's, and I've had a couple big mac impersonators at various restaurants. Some are pretty good, some are meh, and some are fantastic like the one at Kid Cashew. This is something I'd struggle to not get whenever going back to KC. The burger was seasoned and cooked to perfection, and it had char and grill marks to give it a little extra zing. The sauce was spot on, and I'm not sure what could have made this particular burger better. I can't recommend it enough.  Since we were already there, we obviously had to get some baklava. Very good way to round out the evening with some sweet. I'd it was \"good.\" I've had better, but still something I would encourage ordering, especially if you are in the mood.  Besides the above, the menu isn't huge, but there were a lot of things I was back and forth on. I will 100% be back and am looking forward to it.",

    "text": "The only thing worth mentioning is the grilled octopus. The rest of the different plates we ordered were plain, dry and very bland.  The Tzatziki was literally plain sour cream or yogurt. No salt, onion, garlic or lemon juice. Plain!    No self respecting Greek person will call that Tzatziki sauce lol. The chicken was dry and tasteless.  UPDATE:  so i did come back with a fellow foodie friend.  We ordered the octopus which was fabulous again. We got the drink specials of the night which were tasty but very watered down- not a lot of tequila in them but still tasty. My friend loved the steak she ordered.  I ordered a greek salad and again. Very very bland for greek food. So the bottom line is-- the food is good quality and I must say our server was awesome but this is not True Greek food. Just expect very plain versions with no garlic or flavor.   The salad had no vinegar or lemon juice. The chicken had zero flavor or spices on it. Very strange but I did change my rating to 4 stars just because at least the food is good quality and the service was nice.",

    "text": "Absolute worst decision to celebrate my birthday with friends here. After dinner and drinks I decided to ride with one of the others and leave my car parked in their lot only to return a few hours later and find my car booted! I called the number on the receipt and paid the $125 fine because I had no time to waste and I had no receipt to prove I'd been there earlier in the day because my lunch was paid for. I did some digging and found out that they regularly have cars booted daily and they actually have someone watch the parking lot to make sure people aren't parking and going to neighboring bars and restaurants. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! The food and drinks  were ok but the service was slow and after reading previous yelp reviews and responses, I understand why. It's hard to be attentive to your customers if you're watching the parking lot and battling negative PR the whole time. Notice not one response is apologetic or an attempt to solve any issues. They flatly deny that any problems exist which is proposterous even for the best restaurants! There are no cameras watching the lot, a physical human being is being paid to do that and apparsntly respond to negative reviews! Maybe if they put that same amount money and effort into their food and service, people wouldn't just want the parking spaces, they'd want to eat and drink too and there wouldn't be a need to monitor empty parking spaces. Why would anyone patronize such a ridiculous establishment? I know I never will again.",

Other than the fact that it gets a little loud around lunch - so don't go here and expect to have a quiet discussion around the hustle and bustle of lunchtime. The hosts and servers are consistently attentive and courteous - for both eat in and take out. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. The super grains salad is a perfect combination of lettuces, grains, avocado, nuts, dressing and if you add a meat, it's even better!  The grilled octopus is cooked and seasoned wonderfully. The lamb burger is truly their masterpiece!!! Servings are plentiful and although not cheap, I believe worth the quality!

    "text": "Took a couple girlfriends out Friday night for their joint birthdays. The restaurant itself has a cool vibe, and service was mostly on point, which counts for a lot in my book!  When I say we almost ordered everything on the menu, that's no lie!  We were feeling celebratory.   The apps and salads were really nice. The spinach and feta dip, beet salad, and grilled octopus were my faves. Greek salad was also decent. The mac and cheese was ok, but a little dry.  Definitely not a creamy mac and cheese. I had one of the specialty cocktails...the fig mule was ok, but was too sweet for my tastes, so didn't enjoy that cocktail. Wine is always a winner :)  For the main course, we ordered brussel sprouts, eggplant, forbidden rice, fingerling potatoes au gratin, 1/2 lb salmon, 1/2 lb lamb, and 1/2 lb pork.  Again, the sides were good (forbidden rice was delish!), but the meats were disappointing. Out of the three, the salmon was the table favorite. All meats were seasoned identically, with the same sauce on the side, so not a lot of variation here. All were under-seasoned, and the lamb was not tender.  In other reviews, the lamb looked like a winner, so maybe we just had a bad serving?  Who knows...  One thing that bugged me a little was at no point were we provided with clean plates or utensils. I had olive pits hanging out on my plate from the Greek salad through the entire meal. When you order so much, it would have definitely been appreciated to have a clean plate at some point.   All in all, not a total fail. I'd go back for apps and maybe to try a different cocktail, but will likely not be back for dinner.",

I really enjoyed the three dips and pita, but they do not serve enough pita and when you are out but have a large amount of dip left-they charge you extra for more.  I got a pork sandwich, which I won't have again: it was very greasy.  Overall, I like the idea of this place, there are other things on the menu I would like to try, and will give it a second chance.  Maybe try a cocktail or two because they looked fabulous!",

(yes, I can only count to three).  The ambiance is great, on a sunny day you get light coming in and it's very casual chic. The service was good, they explained everything on the menu well and we had a pretty good idea of what to order. We started out with the octopus and roasted beets. The octopus was tender, well made and had good flavor overall. You can't go wrong with roasted local organic beets, ever. The roasted chicken was also very good. Nothing to write home about, but well executed.   I think the highlight for me was their infamous cocktail, the goat's breastmilk. I know some people don't like licorice, but I was a big, big fan... especially of the carafe :)",

The ambiance is warm and inviting, the staff is attentive without being intrusive, and the food is varied and delicious. At this point, I've eaten my way through a good portion of it -- all the hummus spreads, the lamb leg and gyro, the rotisserie chicken, and multiple salads. Now I mostly prefer to order the small plates so I can enjoy a little bit of a lot of dishes. my favorites are the cilantro chicken skewers; greens, grains, and avocado salad; and wood-fired asparagus and grilled beets. Even after ordering from just the vegan side of the menu, I leave full and extremely satisfied with my meals.   When the weather's nice, I prefer to sit outside and add a beer or cocktail to my meal. Since I don't get them back home, I typically opt for a NoDa bottle of crafty goodness or Legion draft, but the lavender lemonade and cucumber basil mule also are refreshing. When the evening temps are cooler, I prefer a hot tea and desert (the key lime. OMG, the key lime...).  I'm in town a lot on business, so often I'm a party of one. I understand it's not ideal for a server to have a single person taking up a four-top in their section, but I've never felt rushed or ignored by the wait staff here, as I've experienced at other restaurants in the area. From the hostess to the table bussers, everyone I've encountered has been pleasant.  I'll be back in town later this month and already am looking forward to introducing a few of my coworkers to one of my new favorite Queen City spots.",

We had ordered a chicken skewer tapas (meh), leg of lamb 16.95, and mountain trout 16.75?.95?     On a positive note let me start by saying the interior was warm and visually inviting, the cocktails were on point and the Malbec was an excellent choice to carry our evening forward.  5 stars easily for the drinks.   On the other hand, the lady (growing up in a country where goat and lamb are staple) couldn't stomach the lamb, it was very beef life in texture and tough.   We have yet to send food back but in this case could not eat it.  Not to mention side dishes were never suggested to us assuming we'd get at least one of the delicious looking options.   I had ordered the mountain trout, flavor was very basic and it was overdone as well. The tomato and cucumber garnish was pleasant to look at and we ended splitting it, perhaps sitting on a bed of plain quinoa caused to the flavors to lack a bit but either way.  It was just edible at best. I'd be willing to give it a second shot for a salad or the chicken... but she wasn't happy",

    "text": "Kid Cashew is a cozy and pretty little spot on Dilworth's Main Street, East Boulevard, with a great vibe especially for lunch or brunch. The decor is extremely pretty and the patio is a great spot to spend a Sunday afternoon at for some Mediterranean food. The four stars here instead of five mostly relates to the menu, which at first glance seems great and diverse but lacks a lot of \"home run\" options. The citrus quinoa salad will have you feeling healthy and refreshed and the quinoa stuffed avocado is a great plate that manages to be more filling than you'd think. $6 cocktails on Thursdays is also a great deal for grabbing drinks before or after dinner.  If you're looking for a fun lunch spot, it's a great option but there are probably better dinner places out there if you want more elevated food.",

    "text": "Excellent atmosphere and ambiance! You are left in awe until you settle in. It's surprising how unanimous the ambiance feels, nothing looks out of place - the couches, the art on the wall, the color palette - this is definitely going down in my list as one of the better looking restaurants in Charlotte.  The menu is simple to choose from - starters, small plates, entrees - sandwiches and burgers and finally the most coveted vegan option. I wasn't eating healthy that day but pleasantly surprised at the number of options you could get if you are on a diet - look around and the crowd speaks for itself - lot of healthy individuals on diet! The other side of the menu is filled with lots of wines, beers and other cocktail drinks.  We got Mac n cheese which was well roasted on the outside it and tasted alright. The burger was alright too. The salmon however looked pathetic and definitely not photogenic so I avoided taking a picture of it- it was too thin like a filet of tilapia, not something we expected. All of the food tasted okay and standard. The chips on the side was a good change from regular restaurant but wished something more substantial would have helped as a side.  On the whole, great restaurant, wonderful atmosphere and ambiance, you won't be disappointed by the food and lots of wines to taste from. Improvement areas - food tastes standard and not really sticks to your memory as the restaurant does!",

With the addition of $3 mimosas, you can't go wrong with Kid Cashew for brunch...for the most part.   Here's why...  The brunch menu is limited but I appreciate the variety of options for Keto or Vegetarians. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal and mentioned that they would return.  The customer service was average. We had a large party and our waitress seemed to be a bit rushed. We ordered our food but were not asked at any point during our meal if we wanted refills or if we cared for dessert (it's brunch...I get it but still ask). Suddenly our checks appeared and our party certainly perceived it as a cue to hurry our meal. Most of the party had practically full plates when the checks arrived.  So, the food was good the jury is still out on the customer service. I had a similar experience on my previous visit.",

Could have been a better way.  Silverware was placed bare on table. Please place on plates or napkins.   House drink Goats Breastmilk was inconsistent. Glasses tasted different. Wish they all tasted as good as some we received.  Now to the great.  Grilled Octopus upon quinoa was very tasty. Could of been served a little warmer but cooked and seasoned very well.  Grilled Asparagus was very good.  Surprised to see lamb burger was 2 patties. Cooked medium well as requested. Chips were tasty.   Nice liquor cabinet and good price on mimosas.

    "text": "Although the initial hype of Kid Cashew has calmed down a bit, the quality of the restaurant has stayed and it's as good as ever. Dinner party reservation for one of my best friends, and even though the place was slammed, the reservation was honored and we had a table waiting for us. Little things like this bring Kid Cashew from 4 to 5 stars.  I went in with 2 other people and split: A Full Chicken, Pork, Acorn Squash, and Mac and Cheese. Full Chicken was enough so that each of us could have a breast and a wing, pork was 2 pieces that we kind of split up, acorn squash was demolished by forks, and mac and cheese was fought over just to see who could have the crispy bits. Everything here in slammed with mediterranean flavor, whether it was it the herb rubbed skin on the chicken, the awesome citrus sauce of the pork (not anything sweet), or the balance of sweet and savory brought out in the charred squash by a little sugar and fresh herbs.  Like my first time here with the yelp crew, I ordered the Goat's Breast Milk because I'm a creature of habit and also a creature of if-the-menu-puts-an-item-in-it's-own-bubble-it-must-be-worth-it-ism. A mojito with a little bit of an anise flavor from ouzo, I adore this. Not everyone will.   Kid Cashew's environment is True family style, and a cozy family at that. It was such a pleasure being able to share the night with a bunch of friends, and this restaurant really helps propagate those memories.",

After walking by this place for the last few months while it was under construction, I finally made it into Kid Cashew.  The decor is totally rustic.  Love.  The food was also rustic and delicious.  Love.  The staff was so friendly and provided great recommendations.  Love.  I'm totally digging the menu.  Simple, yet inventive.  I started out with the Goat's Breast Milk Cocktail.  It was so fresh and well balanced.  Their cocktails are named after the fresh herbs they put in their drinks, so you definitely know what you're getting!  I had an assortment of food.  Chicken is a MUST GET.  It's a simple preparation with a great seasoning on the skin, and every bit is juicy.  The trout was light and not too fishy.  Brussels were good but the winner was by far the Mac & five Cheese Gratin.  I could seriously see myself having a late night binge with a large pot of that Mac & Cheese, and waking up on the couch the next day with a stomach ache from eating too much.  Yum.  This place has a lot of tables that accommodate larger parties.  If my bday dinner wasn't already planned, I would make a reservation here.  Fun atmosphere.  Simple, shareable, delicious food.  Mac & Cheese Gratin to die for.  Thank you, Kid Cashew for opening up down the street from me.  My friends and I will see you often and look forward to putting your kids through college.",

It was a gorgeous sunny day and I got to sit outside on their fairly good sized patio. Their menu is small-ish but definitely could please everyone. Vegan and gluten free friendly. There were MANY items that I wanted to try but went with the lunch combo of quinoa stuffed 1/2 avocado and Mac and cheese. It may be one of the best lunches I've ever had. Will definitely return with friends and family.",

I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken added to it. Not your typical salad. It didn't have lettuce in it at all- which came as a surprise. It was a plate of fresh veggies, mostly cukes and tomatoes with bits of feta cheese. I think it was around $4 to add chicken to the salad, but it was a descent sized portion of chicken. I left satisfied.   Our daughter ordered the mac and cheese from the kids menu. It comes with onions cooked into it...which she turned her nose up to at first, but ended up loving it in the end. I nabbed a bite of the mac and cheese when she wasn't looking it was was really good!",

My taste buds were just overwhelmed, everything was so delicious; from The martinis to the salad, to the appetizer, the entree and dessert. The martinis were rich and flavorful, and had just the right amount of alcohol. The staff was very friendly and gave a girl next-door vibe. The manager was very friendly as well. and came and chatted with us for a little while. My date admitted that he owned a restaurant and not even his food is that that good lol. I give this restaurant a 10 and would recommend any and everyone to dine there. I was there on a Monday, and they had $6 martinis, which they apparently have on Mondays. The manager did tell us that on Tuesdays an entire bottle of wine is half price, and they have great wines, which I do not doubt considering the precedence they have set with delicious food. I will definitely be going back there as frequently as I can and taking my friends along with me.",

We witnessed the chef and so-called-manager argue as it is an open kitchen concept and they had no shame in showing how frustrated they were.

    "text": "Kid Cashew is located in a seemingly cursed restaurant space on East Boulevard that's been home to at least three different restaurants in the five years that I've been in Charlotte. That being said, after my experience last night, I think Kid Cashew is finally going to be the restaurant that has the draw and staying power to buck the location's odds.   There were very few negatives in my experience, so I'll get them out of the way first: 1) parking was a total nightmare! The next time I go to Kid Cashew I will be ubering because ain't nobody got time to be searching for a parking spot for 20+ minutes. 2) Kid Cashew does not accept reservations, so we had to wait for 1.5 hours to get dinner and I was straight up HANGRY by the time we were seated. I would gladly pay a reservation fee, but please don't make me wait! 3) The place was very noisy, I felt like I was shouting the entire evening and left hoarse... the place was bustling, which is a good thing, but they need to do something with the acoustics because the noise levels were a bit out of control.  Okay, on to the positives of my experience: 1) the bar had a pretty great selection of beer, wine, and cocktails at reasonable prices. I stuck to the house Cab Sav, which was affordable and pretty great. The two men in our dinner party had Sycamore IPAs and, despite the bar being completely slammed, we were pleased with how attentive the bartenders were. We had plenty to drink while we waited to be seated. 2) The octopus appetizer was surprisingly good. I was a bit skeptical when our friends ordered it because I've had some pretty chewy octopus in my day, but Kid Cashew's octopus was very citrusy, tasty, and not chewy in the least! 3) Our server was very knowledgable, friendly, and managed a very busy section with ease. 4) Everyone in our dinner party was pleased with their large plates and left full and pleasantly surprised with the generous portions and reasonable prices. 5) The mac and cheese changed my life! Seriously, it was hands down the best that I've ever had... It was crunchy without being too dry, it was cheesy without being too gooey, and it was perfectly sized for me to share and still have my fill.   I'll definitely return to Kid Cashew, but may wait a few months until it's (hopefully) a little less slammed. I can't wait to try to patio (last night it was simply too cold to enjoy the outdoors), and will definitely uber my way there to avoid the chaotic parking situation. Definitely give it a try, you'll likely have to wait a long time for a table and may leave hoarse with ringing ears, but the food and service is totally worth it!",

We ordered drinks- they never came.  We had to inquire and they claimed they didn't have the liquor we ordered, even though it was listed on the menu.  The food came- half of it was cold and majority was bland.  Our server never checked in with us- we had to resort to ordering drinks directly from the bartender.  We had an issue trying to pay our bill.  The whole night was a huge debacle.  #wontbeback",

The waitress was aware that we were distressed and helped make the experience more enjoyable with complimentary appetizer/dessert. I will not come back with a large party until they have heat lamps and are able to serve the entire group their entrees at once.",

We ordered a salad, octopus, mushroom paella, and Brussel sprouts. First the salad came out and my gosh was it salty. Every other bite had a huge grain of salt that I bit into and was too salty to finish...how can a salad be too salty to eat?! And it wasn't even the dressing!! It seemed like whoever made it sprinkled it with way too much salt on top!! Next came our Brussel sprouts and SAME THING! Brussel sprouts is one of my favorite dishes to order when I eat out but this time, waaaaayyy too salty! The portion was so small but we couldn't even finish it because it was way too salty!  Next came the mushroom paella and then octopus. At this point, our tongues were numb from eating chunks of salt. We were scared to bite into the mushroom dish and sure enough, SALT salt and more salt! The mushroom paella was the worst one of all! You couldn't taste anything but salt! It was SO salty that my mother called one of the wait staff over to tell the chef that it's wayyyyy too salty to eat. The waitress came back and said the chef will gladly remake the dish for us. The octopus was the only thing that wasn't overly salted but it was just okay. The mushroom dish was bought back to us and it was a lot less saltier but still way too salty.   My mother and I both went home with numb mouths and lips. My mother's roof of the mouth started peeling at the end of the meal because of all the salt! (No exaggeration here!)   Overall we were very disappointed with the food. I can't believe everything is SO salty!! I know the restaurant is new so I would love to give it another chance but I really think you should go easy on the salt.",

    "text": "Very anxious to try a  new Mediterranean place...this did not float my boat. It did have a darling interior...Wait staff was very nice...very  informative..but the food..was UNSEASONED! Ordered the Tzatziki dip and rustic Bread, also the Eggplant Caponeta with Bread, And the Grain salad. My Friend ordered the Infused Vodka Cilantro Drink.  I was so disappointed with the Bread served with both dips... The waiter was right..You could share them ...if you wanted to. The tzatziki dip was nothing more than Fage Yogurt...with a tiny bit of Cucumber Skin micro planned over it. No lemon, No garlic..nothing ..NO SALT... The Eggplant Caponata was squares of eggplant ..cold...not seasoned. Tasted like it was made a couple of days ago. The bread, which was pita bread tasted flat..not grilled or warmed up. The Salad was attractive looking, it was Quinoa, Barley, Frissee Lettuce with Raisins and a couple of orange slices and a half an avocado. Such an acidic dressing..no SALT and NO Pepper. I can't understand this...it was such a good idea but it just doesn't work here... Like I said...Good Service..informative waiter staff and cute interior...Food..Just Meh!",

Service was very good, attentive but laid back server which I enjoyed.  (There is a kids menu, bonus!) We ordered a Greek salad, not what I was expecting but very good- no lettuce, ha! Just veggies and olives in oil and vinegar with herbs and spices topped with feta. My husband had the lamb burger and I had the roasted pork sandwich.  Both very good. He ordered a side of brussels, I didn't order a side but mine came with the most delicious fingerling potatoes- roasted with herbs and drizzled with some lemon.  The real stand out of this meal was the gelato Sunday. Home made gelato with crunchy butterscotch pieces topped with caramel and chocolate sauces and finished with pistachio. Please save room for this!  We also had the baklava but it was not as crispy as I would have liked.",

Served with pita and whole grain bread. Nice for two people. We had our 4 year old son with us and his Mac and cheese was amazing. The chef watched him from the open kitchen as he enjoyed bite after bite. Definitely made in house! We then ordered a super grains  salad with chicken which my wife said was delicious (looked great) and I had the gyro. This was not the gyro meat on the thing that spins with the heat lamp; this was leg of lamb sliced with pickled onion, fresh tomatoes and a cucumber sauce in a pita. Really tasty and a nice sized portion. They brought out some gelato for my son (also made in house!) and once my wife and I tasted it, it was everything we could do not to finish it ! Needless to say, he finished it all.  Nice place, great service and we will be back.",

I don't believe one could order anything off the menu that would disappoint.  Also, we had a very large party to accommodate this evening, 11 ladies, and the restaurant did an outstanding job preparing for our arrival. Our waitress JJ was superb and was very attentive!  My only suggestion is for the restaurant to improve on noise absorption/acoustics because it was very loud. However, don't let that deter you. I highly recommend trying this restaurant!",

Nothing worse than going to a restaurant and having a novel for a menu (ask Gordon Ramsay). Anyway, the house drinks - \"Living Libations\" - have fresh herbs and are all delicious. The service has been on point every time I've been there. They're classified as Mediterranean but not in a traditional sense...and being a half-Greek who hates olives, I'm great with that! They're consistently busy for lunch and dinner; excellent patio - East Boulevard is great for people watching anyway! Long and short: grab some friends, order the hummus/tzatziki/eggplant caponata app and enjoy! You'll be happy you did.",

Morgen (our server did great) with our table of 8.  Con's:  Sandwiches come with a small amount of potatoes (not listed on menu).  Had we known, we wouldn't have ordered the cheesy potatoes that basically were the same thing (and there was barely and cheese on the side order so really they were just fries). It took literally 25 minutes to get a drink!  We ordered them when the food arrived and got them when we were done.  I was scarfing down wine when we were done and full and no longer wanted it.  Not Morgen's fault, I saw her same frustration w the bartender. Not hard to pour wine. Cost of wine is ridiculous.  A glass is over $12.  Have more choices and a house wine that doesn't cost more than most of the food.   Would go back but I'm not running back.....",

Enjoyed the open-face chicken sandwich with a side of magic beans while my wife loved her Super Salad.   Take the time to find this place.

Very casual interior with that hipster rustic look, but not like overdone garage sale rustic. My pork panini tasted so good it almost felt healthy for me! Pork was chopped up and melted in my mouth. Another sandwich I really liked was the mushroom burger. Didnt miss the meat. They use their dipping sauces to add punch of flavor. It was filling but again fresh and light. The grilled bun was really tasty on its own-smoky, a lil sweet and buttery. Really like that after I eat here I still feel satisfied, feel like Im doing my body good (short of going to the gym) but No food coma and feeling like I have to nap.",

My biggest complaint is that our food and appetizers all came at the same time.  We ordered 3 apps and 3 main dishes so when it all appeared at once, the waiter was almost annoyed that he didn't have enough room on our table to place the dishes. I made a (funnyish) comment on how we didn't expect to receive everything at once, and he was unapologetic. Just waited for us to move our glasses around to fit everything.  Next thing we knew we got the check. Nobody asked if we wanted another drink or dessert. We did, but after feeling so rushed, we just paid and went somewhere else for dessert and drinks.  The food was ok. The lamb, which is what they're supposed to be known for, was just ok. Nothing worth coming back for.",

Hummus and pita arrived with burnt pitas.  The manager apologized and took them off the bill.  Octopus was tasty but room temperature. We had to ask for more pitas so not to waste the hummus. The panini wasn't a panini but BBQ on toasted bread with so much mustard it was overpowering, and a skimpy portion of meat.  Lamb gyros were just ok. Beet salad was very good. Chips that came with sandwiches were not.  Water was refilled 4 times before I got ice.  Guess they had pitchers filled and it all melted.  For the price of the meal, a 2 star rating is generous.

The beef skewers for the appetizers came into two skewers and they were flavorful but a bit chewy. The shrimp appetizers came in 4 large pieces of shrimp in cauliflower mashed potatoes and they were excellent,  again cooked a little bit too long for me. The flavors on both were still great. I order the classic burger they had on the menu came with two patties it was very mediocre for a burger but I didn't expect much. It's suited my expectations I was just craving a burger. On Thursdays however the first four cocktails are only $5 which was an awesome deal. I got the cilantro which consists of cilantro and tequila and some other stuff which were awesome. I also tried the honey bourbon which consisted of Honey and bourbon LOL. I believe on Monday or Tuesdays they have half off Brown liquor and another special another on another day. I went there late so service was fast prompt and not very busy i would try them again another day.",

Really enjoyed chatting with the general manager about his visions for the place (This restaurant is his second - first was in Davidson - and the chef he hired is from San Francisco).  Food we tried was as follows:  (Starter) Spreads Trio [$12.00] - Hummus, an eggplant spread, and a white sauce with some pita and rustic breads.  Good taste to all the spreads, but amount of bread was lacking AND they charged us $2 for extra bread (without telling us!).  (Meat) Mountain Trout [16.50 per 8 oz] - Well cooked except for the blackened skin which just tasted burnt.  Good-size portion for three.  (Meat) Chicken [$17.00 for whole] - Nice and tender, and quite large (we took half home).  Tasty  - not quite Viva Chicken good, but solid.  (Veggies) Sauteed Greens & Brussel Sprouts [$7.00 each] - Nicely done, though a bit more oily than expected.    Overall, we had a good experience and would return.  Total bill for three was $70.36 (no alcohol, before tip).  Solid food a bit overpriced, but a nice addition to East.  Patio looks awesome for warmer weather!",

Octopus and shrimp appetizer were tasty.  We had the risotto which was WAY overdone and gyro which was nothing special. Have been a couple times and the food is just okay. There are a number of vegan/vegetarian options if someone in your group is looking for that. No reservations, nice patio & easy parking in a lot next door.",

We were seated immediately upon arrival which was nice (5:45p on a Saturday is a good time apparently!) and was greeted right away by the table attendant who was super friendly. Our server then followed guiding us to the perfect cocktails. We chose the Basil and the Rosemary and they were delish!! We started with the spinach and feta small plate and it did not disappoint! So tasty!! Following that was the mac & cheese and and was equally as yummy! I had the pork panini and my friends had the lamb burger and the portobello mushroom sandwich. They both stated theirs was out of this world. Mine was ok but the overwhelming taste of spicy brown mustard was too much. Maybe a little less of that and the panini would have been great but I couldn't taste anything more than the mustard unfortunately. We had the Brussels sprouts to accompany our meals and they were ok. For dessert we had the salted caramel gelato sundae and it was OMG amazing!!! I'll let the picture speak for itself!   I will definitely be going back to try one of their salads for lunch and another cocktail for sure!! Go try the place out!!",

Of course, the first thing I did when I sat down was skim the menu for the truffle. Found it! Hidden in the forbidden rice you will find will find wild mushroom truffle oil aromatic broth. Very Nice Dish. I ordered the NC Mountain Trout was cooked nicely, I appreciate this restaurant because not only do I find it fun yet charming, overall, the food is very good. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the Lamb Gyro. It just wasn't good enough compared to the rest of the dining experience. Recommendations: Forbidden Rice, Spanish Octopus, NC Mountain Trout.",

The parking was pretty full but I was still able to find a spot easily. We ordered the brussels sprouts, vegan roasted beets, portobello mushroom sandwich, octopus appetizer, and shrimp appetizer. Everything was very well prepared and had really good flavor. In fact the shrimp was served over grits which were easily the best grits I'd ever had in my life. My party and I have some food in tolerances and our waiter did a great job of allowing us to customize our meals (ie. ordering something without the cheese/bun, or having something served warm instead of cold, etc.). It was pretty busy but the service was at a very good pace. We never had to ask our waiter for anything, he was very attentive with us. They have plenty of outdoor seating, indoor seating and a very large size bar as well. I love that it had plenty of gluten-free options as well as a nice selection of hot teas. Most definitely would return.",

Cute outside - signage is a wooded original and the patio area is a decent size. Don't be alarm when you walk in and there is a creepy/weird curtain thing  that closes off the restaurant from the \"waiting area\"... The inside has a cool feel. The lighting isn't too dim, but not too bright. There is music, but you can barely hear it because it's fairly noisy from everyone talking, which means people are truly enjoying their company.   They have a fairly limited menu, however they have perfected it and it is delicious. It's great for people on diets or not!   My friend and I started off with the feta and spinach dip w/ pita bread and celery... DELICIOUS!! I have a love for spinach dip and this would definitely be in my \"final four\" if there was a bracket. My friend went with the pork shoulder and it was amazing! Perfectly cooked, very tender and full of flavor. I went with the Mac & Cheese, because how could I not with all the mouthwatering pictures of it on Yelp?!? I love Mac & Cheese so it had a lot to live up to, but did it ever... 11 out of 10 stars!!! In my top two of Mac & Cheeses that I've ever had... and that says a lot. They waiter may say that you can share, but DON'T... just don't do it, you'll regret having to share! lol!   We did go on a Thursday night and they happen to have their cocktails for $5, so of course I figured I should try one. I narrowed my pick down to two, but went with the waiter's recommendation of the two. And boy am I glad I did... The Mint Cucumber Mule was TO DIE FOR!!! I can't tell you how delicious it was, it was perfectly concocted!! If you have the day or evening with no plans, BEWARE... those drinks can be dangerous as you could easily drink several and not feel like you're drinking, but will catch up quickly with you! Regardless, it's a must get, but remember it will be hard to have just one!!  I took a look at the brunch menu and it looks just as amazing as the dinner menu! I'm dying to go back (1) to try out brunch (2) to try some more cocktails and (3) to try out that patio!!! This restaurant is the start of a beautiful relationship here in Charlotte...",

Both were phenomenal! I felt like a food blogger as I paid attention to all the flavors. The toppings on the burger did not over power the wood fired flavor of the beef. The special sauce was tasty. The Mac & Cheese didn't disappoint. I was surprised to find leeks in it, a combination I never would have thought to try, but it paired well together. This was our first visit to Kid Cashew but won't be our last. Aside from the delicious food, the decor was awesome and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.

Warm wood finishes and a very open and pleasant atmosphere.  My pet peeves include music that is too loud and tea that is too expensive.   They could have had the music just a notch down and it would have made for a better place to converse.   Likewise, charging $3.00 for a glass of tea seems steepingly steep.   All in all, it was a fun experience on East Blvd. I will remember the fun and the avocado.",

There wasn't a game-y flavor which made it perfect. Not to mention it's a double decker so the portion is huge!  $5 Bloody Mary's: the mix was just right! & need I say more - it was only 5 dollars!  Spicy Feta Spread: the spicy flavors and oils from this dish bring out all the incredible flavors. Topped with warm pita is the perfect combo.   We also ordered: Avocado Toast: This Toast was huge! There was avocado spread with small chucks of cucumber and tomato and the toast was topped with an egg.   Beef Hash: This beef Hash is different from your usual.

    "text": "Nice restaurant! Beautifully decorated inside. We were immediately sat and taken care of by a gentleman named Casey (sp). The shrimp starter was amazing! The burger was very good as well as the chips that come along side it. The chicken avocado sandwich wasn't my favorite, but the cauliflower mash and Mac and cheese were really good! They had a nice craft beer selection as well. I would like to go back for more food and a cocktail. I hear brunch is good too!  Though we were there late at night, I would suggest employee conversations be held more quietly or elsewhere. Probably shouldn't be able to tell who the lead server is on the floor. And someone stole food while we were there? Definitely want to return for a more normal evening!",

The house special cocktail , Goat's Breast Milk, is not only a great name, it's also very tasty and made with ouzo. Of particular note: Brussel sprouts- cooked perfect and delicious Beets- sweet like candy White Beans- simple dish and addicting Trout- nice crispy skin and light flaky fish was excellent Nice atmosphere. Food served quickly, and great quality and plating.",

I've passed by many a Sunday to see people sitting on the patio for brunch.  Kid Cashew really stresses farm to table or butcher to table to eliminate the middle men and provide the community with delicious Mediterranean inspired dishes.  The vibe inside is unique and warm with the open kitchen and stylish decor... really neat space to have a restaurant in.  Decided to go here on a Friday for lunch around 12:30... so peak lunch time.  Our server seemed very off her game, but we later found out she was having a really bad day and apologized to us... I actually didn't get her name cause she didn't even introduce herself... totally get having a bad day but it does show you how much service can really make an impact on your dining experience.  Had a light lunch of the beet and tomato salad, roasted brussel sprouts, and house tazeki sauce.  Sadly the gelato machine has been broken, but we got a slice of the baklava which was amazing.  Our water glasses were always full even though we did have a bit of a \"lazy lunch\" since our server disappeared for some time.  Service aside, I'm glad Kid Cashew is still in the neighborhood.  Once the gelato machine is functioning again, I will have to come back and get their salted caramel gelato sundae.",

    "text": "Stopped into Kid Cashew for an early evening dinner.   Had been wanting to try this restaurant for some time.   Kid Cashew did not disappoint.  Everything was on point.    Service - Our waiter was top notch.  He was very personable, attentive but not over bearing.   Seemed like you were hanging out with a good friend.  He was very helpful especially because we had some food restrictions.  He helped us navigate easily through the menu based on our requests.     Atmosphere- The restaurant has a great vibe.  We sat outside as it was a beautiful night.  Very relaxing  and would enjoy having out during the daytime.    Food -  The food was REALLY good.  We started with the Spanish Octopus appetizer which was done very well.  It was light but had just enough to satisfy the craving.   We moved onto the Leg of Lamb , Scottish Salmon accompanied by the Brussels Sprouts.  The Lamb again was very simple but had a good flavor.  I didn't have any of the side dipping sauce and was happy with the dish.  My wife had the Salmon (minus quinoa).  Again she really enjoyed the dish as it was prepared well.  Finally the Brussell Sprouts.  Let me first say that I am not a big fan of Brussell Sprouts but I really enjoyed them.    They were just a tad salty but that can be easily adjusted.    Overall it was a great experience.  I would repeat and plan to come back and experience the other options.",

Secondly, my friend ordered a martini took a few sips and felt sick the rest of the day from it, I don't know what that was about but it wasn't normal. My friend has been drinking for yeaarss and can handle her drinks so I don't know what happened. Either way because of those drawbacks I probably won't be back despite the food being good.",

Immediately walking in, I was drawn by the design of the space - from the lighting to mixed chairs and even the tableware, it felt very homey and comforting. They have a good variety on the menu, especially for vegetarians and vegans. My friends and I got the hummus starter. I myself got the stuffed avocado, which had some spice, and the Mac and cheese, which was bomb. The only downfall was that for any entree options, you could only get kettle chips - if you wanted Brussel sprouts, Mac & cheese or any other side, you had to just buy the whole side (which $6-9ish dollars was a little pricier than I liked) other than that, good food and service. I'll definitely go back to try other options. The lamb was low key calling my name! Ha",

We started our meal with the spicy feta dip served with grilled pitas, which was quite tasty, although I expected it to be warm, and it is served cold. It had just the right amount of spice, and I'd get it again.   For my entree, I got the shrimp and grits and the French toast with a strawberry cheesecake filling. While hearty, I found the unexpected taste of the shrimp and grits (I felt like I tasted a lot of dill) a bit off-putting. Not bad, but not a dish I'd get again. I strongly suggest you get additonal sides with your entree to make sure you're full.  I ordered the brussel sprouts and macaroni and cheese to go, and found both to be just okay.   The service was excellent from the staff at the front door, to the manager that came by to authorize our restaurant week discount.  Although I would come back to Kid Cashew to give some of the other dishes that caught my eye a try, I'm in no rush to return.",

    "text": "After hearing so many great things about Kid Cashew, we were excited to try it for a Sunday lunch. It was a beautiful day, so patio seating was ideal. We were sat and given menus and waters and told our server would be right with us. But he wasn't - in our time waiting for our server (over 10 minutes), we watched another group that got sat after us leave and we contemplated doing the same. Once our server came, we ordered our entrees and an order of hummus to munch on in preparation for another long wait.  The hummus came quickly. The pita was tasty, perfectly grilled. The hummus wasn't like any hummus I'd had before - yes, it had chickpeas, but it was more of a thick bean dip. It didn't taste like hummus and you had to use a knife to spread it on the pita in order to eat it. Not impressed.  When our food came, my husband had the     slow-cooked pork panini with \"spicy mustard\". The spicy mustard had SO much horseradish that you couldn't taste anything else on the sandwich - in a blind taste test, I never would have noticed the pork, Gouda, picked mushrooms or bread. And it came with a side of roasted baby potatoes - he got two, cut in half. Is that a side or an afterthought?  I ordered the lamb gyro. Again, the pita was great. Fluffy, seasoned right and not too thick. The tzatziki was good, although a bit on the sour side and thinly spread, leaving only every other bite with any sauce. The insufficient amount of tzatziki further emphasized how dry the lamb was. The gyro had all the right components, but wasn't tasty enough to finish. Thank goodness I got a bit more potatoes than my husband to make up for it.  The meal ended with another wait - we had to flag the waiter down to get the check and waited another 10 minutes for him to reappear to run our card. Groan. He wasn't that busy - he had one other table who we watched him individually carry out 4 glasses of tea during our wait to have our card run.   Overall, the pros are: great patio, good pita, great service from waiter assistants (our water glasses stayed full).  Cons: while the restaurant is farm to table and doesn't use friers, heat lamps, etc, we found the flavor lacking and food not well prepared. The service was slow... annoyingly slow.",

Yet, the hostess wanted to sandwich in our party of two between two other tables when a plentiful amount of tables were open.  Gosh, I hate it when they try to do that.  We refused and asked to be seated at a table in the middle where no one else was sitting.   The service by Joshua was awesome.  He's the reason this rating is a 3 instead of a 2.  The food was \"meh.\"  The baked spinach and feta was ok, and the Brussels Sprouts were ok.  The super grain salad was very good, the Chardonnay was ok, and the Pomegranate drink was extremely good.  The \"gyro\" which had\"ok\" lamb was just ok.    The price for baked spinach (small dish), a salad, a side of Brussels Sprouts, a side \"gyro\", two house Chardonnays and a mixed drink was $63.87.  A seemingly high price for \"ok,\" average, run-of-the-mill  food on a Saturday before the dinner crowd arrived.  Just ok.  Won't bother to go back.",

    "text": "I was excited to feed into all the hype around Kid Cashew when a group of 4 of us went on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday. I arrived early and sat at the bar where I had the Goats Breast Milk - delicious! Once a couple of us arrived, we ordered the hummus, spicy feta, and tzatziki trio which was absolutely delicious minus the fact that we had to place TWO extra orders of pita to have enough. That turned it into an extremely expensive side for what it was.  Once we were finally seated, about 20 mins after our table was supposed to be ready, we continued to sit for another 10-15 until we got service. The waitress was sweet but she stopped by our table maybe 3-4 times the entire night so we felt we were asking for a lot every time she decided to stop by (drinks, silverware, even the basics). We really loved the half chicken and pork shoulder...the flavors were outstanding. My friend was not so lucky with the lamb - it looked like something i would give my dog it was so dry and overcooked. The beet side was excellent. Unfortunately, the mac n cheese and potato gratin were both extremely dry, bland, and disappointing which left me and my friend with a meat-only meal.  When the time came for dessert, we let the waitress know it was our friends birthday and she informed us that \"Kid Cashew doesn't do anything for birthdays\" but she could bring us a candle if we wanted. Really?!?! After spending $75 on a hit and miss meal you can't even give a girl a dessert? After debating taking the candle and sticking it in the potato gratin of Death Valley, we sucked it up and ordered the heath bar chocolate gelato which helped sweeten our bitterness over the lack of service and dry food.  All in all, I would try Kid Cashew again but between the service and the hit and miss food, I am moving some other new restaurants higher on the priority list to try.",

On top of making some fine cocktails he told us the best things to try on the menu.  Starting off we had the calamari which was amazing, no complaints there. For my main dish I had the lamb burger which was perfect. I had it medium rare, and it still wasn't gamey tasting which it can make it or break it. Defiantly an awesome choice. My friend had the chicken, which honestly I was against since common I can make chicken at home and it comes out pretty decent. I must say that chicken was hella good. It was at that fall of the bone juicy stage, perfect  (yeah, my chicken isn't like that at home...). For sides we went with the wild rice- yummmm, and then the white beans -ehhh. So probably my fault on the white beans, I was picturing white string beans for some reason and these were white bean beans which I don't like. For being beans they weren't half bad but honestly it's a texture thing. For dessert we knocked back a bottle of wine. Perfect way to end the evening. Must say I will definitely be back!",

The food is decent, it's close to where I work which makes it convenient.  Not eating beef, pork or lamb makes it a really condensed menu for me but the super grains salad is my favorite.  I do think it is outrageous to change $6 for a 3 shrimp add on and $5.5 for a ramekin of dry hummus isn't okay.  Their hummus should be smooth and creamy.  This is more like a mashed bean/mashed potato consistency.  Would like to try brunch!",

Even though I feel I ordered wrong but not getting the meats with the dipping sauces my Gyro was fantastic so I only feel a little regret.  I had not had a quality gyro in quite some time and it really hit the spot.   While we were there the place was serving a party of about thirty but we still got excellent service!  It was impressive to watch them take care of a big group and still be able to help us.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and will definitely try the meat plate next time.",

    "text": "Really liked the interior of the place, has the hipster vibe to match the neighborhood it's in. The staff was friendly and we were seated fast. Had the trio of dips as an appetizer, it was solid, but next time I'd go with only the eggplant hummus, it was the best one of the three. Very good coffee, which is fairly unusual for a food spot. My husband had shrimp and grits as his main course, no complains there. My daughter had the chicken pizza of the kids menu - lots of chicken, looked delicious, she could only eat half, very generous portion. I had the lamb burger, and it might've been the best lamb burger I've had in years, cooked just right, juicy patties, amazing flavor with the bun, onion jam, the mint and arugula. I'll be coming back just for that. Split French toast for dessert, could've easily skipped that, nothing special.  Minus one star for slow service and the way the food came out - three of us had our entrees with 5 minute increments, so by the time I got my food, my husband was almost done eating. The amazing burger would've made me overlook way worse service though. It was that good.",

    "text": "Very cute decor/atmosphere, mediocre food, poor service.  A group of 8 of us came to eat Sunday night and we're excited to try this place, but we were overall disappointed.   They were extremely understaffed. No one came to the table for at least 8-10 min after we were seated. Someone eventually came & got our drink orders and then 5 minutes later our assigned server came to greet us. She let us know it would be tapas style and food would come out as it was prepared which is fine, we love tapas style! Problem was that plates they serve are not truly tapas (we ordered salsa and sandwiches for the most part). They aren't very shareable. Half of the table got their food in about 30 minutes while the second half waited an additional 25-30 minutes for their food (the first half was finished before the second half's food even made it to the table). Everyone at our table agreed the food was mediocre, nothing special.  They realized the service was horrible so did bring a dip trio to the half of the table that had no food for the first hour we were there and they also brought us dessert on the house.  Overall I would probably not go back.",

Atmosphere - loved the outside seating, perfect for the warm summer nights here in Charlotte   Food - we ordered the three plate app of hummus, tzatki, and eggplant - this was OK. I've had a lot better. My husband loves the Mac n cheese. We ordered a lamb burger too and after a half an hour they told us they were sold out. Loved their Brussels sprouts.   Service - our waiter returned maybe twice. He didn't bring us our second drink until we had to ask again, about an hour later. Two waiters mistakingly came to our table with plates that weren't our order. The fork was dirty so I had to request a clean set.   Overall, I don't think we'll be returning.",

However.....the food. So-so food. I hate to say that because I really wanted to be impressed. We had to send back the Salmon, it was raw. Our waiter did not ask us how we wanted it prepared, so we assumed it would be Medium. It was raw. The trio app was disappointing, of the trio the Hummus was the best of the three options, and they can put the wheat bread away and just leave the pita wedges please. The grain salad has way too much dressing and was not that tasteful. All in all we were disappointed in our meal and will not go back to eat however we will definitely go back to drink a beer or have a glass of wine on the Patio.",

Lamb burger was decent but why put two tiny fingerling potatoes on the plate with it. Either serve a side or don't. Multigrain salad was good but didn't enjoy the shredded chicken on top. Wood fired beets took on the flavor of ash and were not enjoyed by my group. Wishing I had ordered the chicken and mac & cheese. Waiter was friendly and attentive but food was not timed appropriately as not everyone's order arrived at the table at the same time.",
