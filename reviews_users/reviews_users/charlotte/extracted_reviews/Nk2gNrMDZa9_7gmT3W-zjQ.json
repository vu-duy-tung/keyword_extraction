    "text": "Met an old friend here for lunch yesterday, Saturday 4/25.  We started a Thai iced coffee (for her) and a Thai iced tea (for me).  I had informed our server of my food allergies, of which he took time to notate down before heading of to the kitchen.  He did say that Thai Taste is more than willing to accomodate by omitting the ingredients I couldn't eat and substituting items that are more appropriate.  I asked if TT made their own curry pastes, and he said yes (and no, they do not use shrimp or shrimp paste in their curry pastes!).  I had spotted the daily specials board located outside by the front entrance that included soft-shelled crab (2 pcs.) with chu chee sauce and jasmine rice for $16.95.  (Mango sticky rice and Thai fried ice cream (!) were also featured.)  Our server said that if we did not like chu chee sauce (a coconut-based red curry sauce traditionally used with seafood, such as scallops and prawns/shrimp), we could opt for basil or ginger sauce.  I was also eyeing Pud Thai (their spelling) or green curry with tofu.  When I told Tina about the crab special, she ooh'ed and ah'ed, so we decided we'd split an entree.  Our server, however, had bad news- he was just told he'd have to go to the grocery for a crab run as the kitchen had just run out! Tina decided she would get the Larb with chicken (basically a spicy dish of ground chicken lettuce wraps), and I ordered the green curry.  Tina started her meal with celery soup, a soup I'd encountered at almost every Thai venue I've eaten at, but this version contained grains that looked like barley.  She thought it was good.    We didn't have to wait long for our entrees.  Her larb with chicken came out first, and what a beautiful sight it was!  It smelled marvelous, too, and Tina dished out a generous serving for me to try.  My green curry, with carrots, peas, green beans, bamboo shoots, broccoli, and tofu, was not far behind; The bowl in which it was served in was smaller than I've seen elsewhere, and without the usual accompaniments of soup and eggroll (due to my food allergies), $7.95 for a basically a cup of green curry and jasmine rice was pricey.  I think the kitchen added broccoli to sub for the eggroll, as it was not listed as an ingredient in green curry.  (For anyone with a mustard allergy- broccoli is listed as one of over 300 plants within the mustard family.)  I have to say that this green curry dish ranks as one of the best I've ever tried (mirroring Phoenix's Thai Elephant's on Adams and Thai Hut's, Mesa's Palee's Crown's, and Scottsdale's Tottie's Asian Fusion's)!  I could drink the green curry elixir straight  from the bowl!  It was that good!  Clean, comfortable setting, great food, awesome service, and bright and clean women's restroom- what more can one ask for?  Ah, maybe an ample supply of soft-shelled crabs?  Haha!  No worries there, as the menu seems very promising!  Great QC spot for Thai!  I'll be visiting again before flying home.  (Actually, I wasn't able to go back a second time, but my sister took her coworker to lunch soon after, and they both LOVED the green curry!)",

The food came out fairly quickly (but not scary quick) and was delicious. We had hot tea, chicken sar teh (with an awesome peanut sauce), I had Gaeng Panang (red curry with pineapple and basil) with chicken, though it was missing the basil the pineapple didn't taste canned which I've had happen.

We opted for the lightly fried spring rolls which were delivered quickly.  They were simple but a good start to the meal.  I tried a Tom Yum soup at a medium spice with chicken for the next taste.  The soup was great, nice kick in spice but not over powering.  Broth was delicious and reminded me of a Thai restaurant I frequented in New York.  For the main course we opted for a cashew chicken stir fry and a garlic based chicken stir fry.  Both were great with an over generous portion.  So much food and so little room that we brought half home.  The waitress helped package the leftovers and even included more fresh rice in the box, an unexpected treat.  With a selection of alcoholic beverages and tip on top of the overall meal; the bill was under $50 for two.  Looking forward to going back!",

I'm incredibly pleased with our dinner tonight. Takeout only took 10 minutes. (just enough time to put on pants, get in the car, and go pick it up) I don't see myself dining in at any point because I truly am a takeout person when it comes to weeknights and asian food, but their restaurant was clean and very cute. Service was very fast and courteous. The food tasted fresh off the wok and was well seasoned for two non-spicy dishes. (Again, I love spicy but I'm trying to convert the significant other from chinese to thai so baby steps) A lot of pad see ewe's I've tried in the past had unreasonably thick, chewy noodles, which was refreshingly not the case here. Will definitely be ordering again.",

    "text": "First, I'm sorry to say it, because even though it was take out, the customer service was fantastic, and the guy on the phone was, dare I say, warm and charming even, and very helpful answering my questions.  But. Charlotte, we've got some problems. First off, the tom kha soup was the saltiest I have ever had. It's my favorite Thai soup so I've had plenty, and typically it is mildly sweet and fragrant. This soup was as salty as Campbell's chicken noodle soup! (Which, if you're not familiar, is salty like a pretzel factory exploded nearby.) I actually couldn't eat it. I tried. Also the mushrooms looked old, and I couldn't taste any lemongrass. :-/  F  The side salad was definitely promising. It had lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, sprouts and two pieces of fried tofu, which was a nice surprise! Unfortunately, it was only an okay salad. To their credit, it was larger and more ambitious than most restaurant side salads, but the dressing, while tasty, was fairly lumpy. I'm willing to overlook it. B  Finally, I ordered the chicken fried rice with vegetables. I cannot actually weigh the taste honestly because my palate was completely wrecked by the soup, which I kept trying to make work even though I knew better, because it really is my favorite, and I was in sodium denial. That was totally my mistake, not the fried rice's. So, I'll say it tasted okay. Not great but fine. However... the broccoli was in giant florets I had to cut down to manageable size, and they were old. (You can tell because they had dark/black stuff on them which is what happens when the broccoli was sliced a few days ago.) I threw out the stumps with black stuff and salvaged the rest, but that's just not what you want to do with your take out. If I'd made it myself, and it was my first try at making Thai food from a Pinterest recipe, sure. I'd throw in a potato to leech out the extra salt, and cut off the black parts, and be right proud of myself. But, from a restaurant, I want better. C? B-?   Again, the service was great. They just need to hire new cooks. (And get rid of that weird section of the wall for selling jewelry. It really brings down the ambiance.) If they do, I'd be happy to try them again. Until then, I'm afraid not.",

However, for the time being this one is close.  I have not been here enough times to be able to rate consistency but on my last visit I was pleased.  I ordered their cashew and vegetable dish and it was so good I almost licked the remaining sauce off the plate.   Im still dreaming about that wonderful basil infused spicy, salty, brothy, tasty sauce.   The vegetarian spring rolls were also delish and they include 4. I almost  jumped out of my chair when they asked if I wanted dessert and then mentioned 3 on the menu.  What!?!?!  Dessert?  No Thai place I've been to here has dessert other than sticky rice with mango, if any at all.  YAY!!!!  I ordered the fried ice cream and it was a nice ending to a great meal.  No, it still doesn't compare to the lucious fried ice cream they serve in Miami floating on top of a sweetened condensed coconut milk and drizzled with chocolate sauce..... **drool**  but it will do.   If they add fried Thai donuts to the menu they will have a loyal Fan.  :)",

Service is fast and friendly.... you can get in and out pretty quickly or even east at your leisure (since the place is nicely decorated with images - I'm assuming from Thailand or the Thai artwork on the walls).  You can customize your heat level if needed, but I usually leave it up to the chef and it's right about a medium.  There are two entrances to this location so it can get a little disorienting, but the place is cozy enough to \"right the ship\" before it sails out the wrong door.  Even if it does, it's not that bad of a walk around the building.  It also looks like they sell jewelry in the lobby area, not sure if the owner makes it his/herself, but it's a great idea to kill time if you are waiting on a table.",

Oh, and that includes your tea if you choose to have that. Everyone in the restaurant is very nice, and very accommodating! I've been going here for 8 years. The only thing I would say is to be careful with your space number. Spice intensity ranges from 1 to 5. I used to get at 3, but have downgraded to a 2. I think the different chef are either heavy or less heavy handed on spice! Either way I'll be going here for as long as they're open!",

For a vegetarian who doesn't eat seafood, there are only a few options, as there is fish sauce or shrimp sauce in almost everything. True veg options: Tom Kha soup, veg fried rice & veg pad thai.   TOM KHA soup: the spiciness and the texture is a little inconsistent. In a large hot pot, some areas are thin and watery and some are thicker and a little grainy. If you keep stirring it, though, it's fine. Overall, I really like it. It's spicy (although spice level 4- the hottest offered- is not really that hot for someone who enjoys spicy food) and sour (lime?) and a little sweet and creamy from the coconut milk. I got this two nights in a row, so it's definitely good.   TOM YUM soup: this was actually spicy at level 4. Seemed healthy, with a broth base and lots of veggies. Very flavorful.   RED CURRY with vegetables: bamboo shoots, red peppers, peas in a sweetish but slightly spicy sauce. The sauce is a little grainy, but still tasty.   YUM NEUR salad with thinly sliced beef spiced with chilies, cilantro and lime juice - tasted sweet and spicy. The salad felt light and healthy but satisfying. Also, it was beautifully presented on a footed plate.",

The customer service was top notch. The young man who took my order was also serving tables, but he didn't miss a beat.   I went to the bathroom, which was clean, and while I was walking out I noticed the array of photographs taken in Thailand which lined the walls. I appreciated going on this little art stroll while I waited for my food...but that wasn't very long lol...7-8 minutes at most.   I ordered the pad Thai (which is my go to when I'm trying a new Thai place for the first time). When I asked if there was like in the bag I was told the didn't have any like. The young man said they had lemon but that they don't usually include it with the meal because the food already has a lot of flavor...but that the would give me some. My thoughts were, I will be the judge of the food, get me some lemon just in case. I would be darned if he wasn't right! Lol. The food was fantastic, even without the added citrus. It stayed hot for a good while, and the dinner portion was plenty...enough to share with my bf, who I swear has a bottomless stomach sometimes.   I did get an extra egg in my pad Thai, which I was charged an extra dollar for (bringing my total to around $13)...my regular Thai spot never charges me for an extra egg, but my regular Thai spot isn't really this good either...and hey, I get it, the prices of chickens and their potential offspring who will never be is on the rise...can't afford to go around giving out free eggs and whatnot.

    "text": "Took my female friend out for Thai food . Being her first time with this cuisine, I read great Yelp reviews of this place and decided to try it.  The restaurants decor is basic. If you are looking for a restaurant based on atmosphere, I suggest you look elsewhere. If you are looking for a place that has extremely flavorful Thai food, this place fits the bill! My friend and I tried 2 entrees and 1 appetizer. All 3 dishes were nice sized portions and quite tasty. We had a shrimp dish that had a nice amount of shrimp in it which is always a nice surprise. I'll be darned if I could remember the name of the dish, but idiot me didn't write down what it was lol. The wine menu is sparse but the sake they carry was quite good.  Our make server (Dan I believe) was extremely friendly and informative. He had worked there for years and just came back after a stint in Utah. His suggestions were spot on. As long as he remembers the difference between Pinot Noir and Pinot Grigio, all is good lol.   I will definitely eat here again. Enjoyable food at a reasonable price!!",

This location is in a good spot because it's me you're a Starbucks and grocery store so I went here for lunch.  Best thing of my visit was the taste of the food. I got the pad si eew with broccoli and carrots and it was delicious. I never get spice because I learned the hard way that Thai spice is not your normal spice. One thing that came with the lunch special like a spring roll and that was a little underwhelming. It literally only contain cabbage and was a little chewy vs crunchy.   Service during lunch rush was decent. I just did a to go order so I thought I would have been in and out a little faster. But they only had one person working the register. I'm a strong proponent that if it is a peak hour of working then there should be ample amount of service people to accommodate.    Would I return absolutely - the food was delicious.",

I like to judge a place by their pad thai, which is my staple, and I give them a 4/5. The one subtracted point is because the chicken and shrimp in my last pt tasted like they were boiled and added last...they didn't taste like the rest of the dish. It wasn't bad but I've had better at Thai Taste.   Definitely worth going back again and again.",

I was seriously craving Pad Thai tonight and there aren't many resturant's in the University area that make it (that I'm aware of).  I place my order and ask for no egg.  The food comes out and I check the order before I leave.  It looked a little dry when I opened it and so, I asked for more.  The lady behind the counter said that there is no extra sauce already made up, I would have to request it and they would cook to order.  So I shrugged my shoulders and said ok what can you do, I'm definitely NOT sending food back and make the cook angry (we all know what happens when you do that).  So I got home, made my plate and sat down ready to eat.  I should've know there were going to be problems when all the noodles stuck to my fork and I had to use my other finger to push it onto the plate.  I took the first bite and YUCK !  Taste like I was eating rubber bands and that was just the noodles, the chicken was even worse.  It was solid, wasn't juicy or had any taste to it and hard as a rock.  Guess I can knock this place off my list of resturant's to go back to in the University area.  So disappointed!",

It is nestled in a plaza with many other restaurants, a Starbucks and a few other businesses.  You can see the back part of the building from the road if you are searching for it.  I have been here a few times- mostly all during lunch time.  They do have a lunch special with a variety of choices.  They have a very traditional Thai restaurant menu.  I have tried both the Pad Thai and Coconut Red Curry/Panang.  Both were good, but not the most amazing dishes I ever have had.  The one thing I don't love about this location is how it closes in the middle of the day.  I know this is pretty traditional for many Asian type restaurants but it's inconvenient if you are looking for food at non-traditional eating times.    Solid choice but I personally prefer the other Thai restaurant in the University area.",

    "text": "When I left here, I felt like I had just been at a friend's moms house. And that is the most sincere compliment that I could give this place.   Each lunch meal comes with a cup of soup and spring roll. The soup is broth filled with rice, celery, carrots, tofu and not much else. The spring roll is hot and super crispy but filled with only veggies - mostly cabbage. The soup didn't do for it. Sriracha couldn't save it and so I left mine untouched.   I ordered pad Thai and chicken larb.   The chicken larb was everything. It was funky, spicy, sour and just done right. The only thing I didn't really like is they served it on top of small pieces of lettuce. It's pretty typical to get larb with big pieces of lettuce or cabbage so you can scoop it up and eat it like that. The larb was some of the best I had in a long time. You can pick your level of spicy from from 1-5, I went with five. And the spice and heat did not disappoint.   The pad Thai was definitely a lunch version special. It came with 5 shrimps and was light on the egg and bean sprouts. However the flavor was spot on. It had all the flavors you expect from a well balanced pad Thai - sweet, salty, spicy and plenty of umami.   I'd definitely come back. The staff was friendly, pleasant and attentive without being over bearing. I thought I would be the lone man out eating by myself but seems it's a popular place for a singles lunch.",

I went with the shrimp pad thai lunch special, which the menu said came with a drink, spring roll and soup. The employee helping me said that to go orders didn't come with soup and I was okay with that. She then had another employee settle my bill. As I paid, I asked about the drink and was told it was only for dine in orders. When I asked if I was being charged the same price for the lunch special even though I was getting two less items, I was told yes and that they offer more for dine in customers to encourage people to eat in. My total was right under $12, which wasn't outlandish but I think they should at least provide those ordering to go lunch specials with a drink.   The food itself was pretty good. I received five tail on shrimp that were so large, I cut them in half. The heat (I ordered a level three) was perfect. The spring roll was kinda bland but not the worst thing I've ever had. I do wish they offered side wedges of lime (I was told they don't carry them).",

I don't know if they are the same or owned by the same people or not, but the food is completely different.  They have a lot of really good lunch specials to check out! I had the pad kee mao and enjoyed it.  It was made just how I asked, delicious flavor.  I ordered a number 4 spicy and it could've been even more spicy. They have good sauces, try the green one..very unique.  The mango sticky rice finished off my move perfectly.  Great service and extremely attentive staff!! I will be coming here more often now.",

That location eventually moved to East Boulevard and they opened a university location later. The son of the original owner primarily runs this location. I have been eating here for many years and the food is always outstanding! Some of my favorite dishes are Gang Dang (Red Curry) with chicken, Pud Gra Pow (minced chicken), Pud Prik Khing (squid or any seafood) and Pud Kee Meow (any seafood).  I like to put fish sauce on any Thai seafood dish but you have to ask for it as they don't keep it on the table. I have been eating Thai food for many years so I usually get mine Thai hot with fresh chilis which they can do. They have lunch specials Monday through Friday until 2:30 PM and Saturday until 3 PM. The lunch specials come with the entree, soup and a spring roll.",

The lunch special comes with a soup, spring roll, entree, and tea for a reasonable price. Not the best Thai I've ever had, but not the worst.   The service was friendly and prompt, but the food came out so quick it was obvious that the food was not made to order. I suspect they cook large vats of the dishes and simply add spice to the specification of each order. I expect my food cooked to order...point blank...no discussion. Not sure it would be my first choice for a lunch, but if someone else chose it I wouldn't be adamant about not going.",

We were pleasantly surprised by its location; this restaurant is nearby a lot of other spots: a European Wax Center, a 9round, a Cold Stone Creamery. The menu itself was really small -- probably only 6 items for lunch. I ordered the pad thai and enjoyed it, but it fell short of really satisfying that craving I had.  We were in and out within 30-45 minutes? We got the check a couple minutes after they brought our food, which made us feel a little bit rushed.   It is locally owned, and for that reason I think I'll be back.",

I was severely disappointed. The one star is for the fried dumplings that tasted halfway ok but still not what I'm accustomed to when it comes to Thai Taste. I ordered the fried dumplings and chicken pad Thai with number 2 spicy. Or what I call...my usual. And it was horrible. So horrible in fact I ate about 5 spoonfuls before closing the container and just going to bed. The next day I threw it out. I'd hope that it would be similar in flavor but not exactly the same. I also think that this was precooked with meat thrown in. My food came out too fast for it to have been fresh. It had a weird sweetness to it and then a fish oil taste with hints of spice. That's it. No flavor whatsoever. I won't be back.",

Being Asian and super busy with work, I am always looking for good comfort foods that remind me of home cooking. I was so happy when I moved to the area and found a Thai place nearby.  I always give a restaurant multiple tries before I write a negative review so that I am fair when rating. With that being said, the first time I ordered from there the food was bland and portion sizes were on the scant size for price. The second time I ordered from there, food was still lacking the vivid flavor and aroma that Thai food is known for. I still tried to give them a chance, and on the third try I was not able to pick up my order so I sent my sister instead. She wasn't very familiar with the area and showed up about 15min min late since the restaurant was closing for lunch to prepare for dinner.  My sister came home upset with the take out order in her hand. I asked her what had happened and she told me that while she picked up the food and apologized for being a little late, she could hear the staff in the back near the kitchen talking about her in Thai. Yes! Suprise!!!! My sister speaks Thai! The satff was complaining about customers like \"her\" who can't \"read\" opening and closing times...and blah blah blah. How condescending!  For a restaurant that is seldom busy and struggling to stay open, you would think that they would be thankful for the customers they receive. Your customers are your livelihood!",

Not horrible enough to send it back, but not good enough to think \"hey, wow, I want to go there again\".  Especially when I can get great noodle dishes at several different places around the University.",

    "text": "The other reviewers seemed to be first timers, but not me!  I have been here probably 30 times at least!    I LOVE THIS PLACE.  We have been customers here since they opened the University restaurant.  The wait staff is wonderful - the same people have been working here for years - and very helpful with the menu for those that are not as knowledgeable about Thai food.  My favorites... shrimp pad thai (sweet flavor and GIANT shrimp), shrimp fried rice (smoky taste, with those giant shrimp again!), spring rolls, wonderful lunch soup.  My husband orders curried tofu and is always pleased.  The restaurant is very accommodating to large parties, especially those with children.  We always bring our out of town guests to eat here and it has always been a wonderful exerience.",

    "text": "Thai Taste has decent Pad Thai and Green Curry, two of my favorite Thai dishes. THey offer heat levels from 0-5 plus \"Thai Spicy\". Beware though because just yesterday  my wife received green curry which was ordered with heat level 1, but it had considerable heat, I would rate the heat a 3. They also offer papaya salad which is good. I am going to try the Tom Yum soup at some point soon. The lunch specials are very affordable and the service is quick.",

    "text": "This place is right next to my office, so I love to run over and grab the lunch specials when I have time. My only disappointment is that you have to dine in to get the free soup, spring roll, and iced tea that makes \"the special\". Perfect for satisfying my craving for Thai, however. And since I'm a wimp when it comes to heat, I like being able to order the level of spice according to my mood that day.",

Unfortunately I can't really comment on other items on the menu because this is all I ever order :)  I've tried Pad Thai at other restaurants and they don't come close.",
