Bright decor, friendly staff and owner, but the food is the hands-down best part of this establishment.   My husband's favorite is the lamb gyro and lemon oregano fries, and my new favorite are the spinach pie triangles. Paired with a wonderfully garlicky tzatziki  sauce, I absolutely devoured the treat.   My family lives in the area and dines at GFG at least weekly, and we continue to rave about it to all our local friends. Can't wait to keep trying new items off the menu - we'll be back soon!",

The owner is usually there and always has a smile on his face. I love their salads and the kids really dig the chicken kabobs. We tried another greek place, near Earth Fare in South Charlotte...it did not come close to Greco! We keep coming back for the great food and the everyone's friendly attitude. SOLID casual and soooo good!!",

The wife decided that we split the lahano salata, which is a traditional Greek salad made with cabbage, fennel, green onions and dill, if I am not mistaken.  All the food was authentic and the chef/cook came out and talked to us to see how everything was.  It was nice to try something a little different than the usual Greek food.  The service was great all around and we ordered baklava to go.  I can't wait to return and explore more of the menu next time.",

Plenty of seasoning, the zazikki is home made, cucumber and yogurt goodness.  I did eat mine in the foil wrapper as the juices want to slide out the back. Lol. The food is served in plastic baskets which makes it hard to eat with fork and knife but there are plenty of napkins to be had.   The place is in a strip mall, just a little hole in the wall but clean and nicely set up.  Place your order at the counter and have a seat. Only took about 10 minutes for our three orders to come up. The staff are all friendly and attentive and the owner chatted with us while we ate.   I recommend saving room for the home made baclava. Layers of crispy FILO, just the right amount of honey and yummy walnuts. Fresh and moist!  All those flavors created a party in my mouth!!  Thanks! We'll be back!",

    "text": "First time we dined at Greco Fresh, it was amazing. Took friends for lunch the following weekend. Yesterday, we were sorely disappointed.   Pita bread was delish, but the \"lamb gyro\" meat was questionable at best. Looked like a formed loaf which was served luke warm. (My teen who works at a local sandwich shop said it looks just like the \"gyro\" meat they receive frozen and reheat for their \"signature gyros\"). Whole red onion pieces, probably the ends, came off when I bit into my gyro. Not what I expect for a $26 lunch.  Skimpy on the sauce. Fries lukewarm, limp, greasy lacking flavor. Agree with the poster about folks \"lining up for gyros and Greek fries.\" No spinach pie the day we visited either.  To top it all off, each of us ate our meal the rest of the day =/  My teen boys do not want to return to Greco. That says it all.",

The lamb in the gyro is so delectably tender and well seasoned that nothing even comes close...anywhere. We're from NYC and have had a good gyro here and there but this really kicks butt. Not to be outshined were the kebabs. Seasoned to perfection and moist! The portions and price are just right. We've been here before but we continue to come back because of the consistency of service and food.  The owner, by the way, is a rare guy indeed. In a world where the dollar is what motivates us all, this man has has a passion for his food and it shows.  Give this place a try and you won't be sorry. There are some businesses I'd like to see stick around and be successful and this is one of them.",

Either way, not bad, not fantastic  Tonite we decided to try this place again due to the  fact that we were DYING for chicken gyros.  I have to say it was hugely better than the first time that we tried it so I am changing my review. It was AWESOME tonite.  Amazingly fresh...very tasty, and the gyro meat was not dry at all like last time.   Much better experience and now we are going to be regulars!

I'm in Blakney shopping, enjoying the live music on the weekends and taking my daughter to get Five Guys (right next door) and not once did I think to step foot into Greco until just recently. My husband and I were hungry and of course my daughter wanted Five Guys and we of course are not fans of burgers and greasy fries. So my daughter suggested we step into the quaint restaurant next door and we DID. This was one of the BEST IDEAS ever, we both ordered the Chicken Gyro and my husband got hummus as a side and I ordered the Lemon Oregano fries (which my husband ate majority of).  The service was on point and the food was made FRESH and the taste was perfect. We entered the restaurant only 15 minutes before closing and the manager was so nice in catering to us and coming over to the table and talking with us trying to figure out the same question we ask ourselves \"Why is this our first time in the restaurant\"? He ensured us that we would not be disappointed and he was definitely correct. We LOVED it and we have been back twice since our first visit and I indulged in the same item, my husband has also tried the lamb burger and he enjoyed it.  Check out Greco Fresh Grille and again I highly recommend the chicken gyro and the fresh cut lemon oregano fries.",

They could be adding gasoline for all I know and I wouldn't even care.  The consistency is perfect, the flavor mixture is spot on, the pita bread served with it is warm and fresh.  Yummm...what a treat.  They offer other flavors of hummus as well including Chipolte and traditional.  I'm sure they are great.    The greek salad was very good and the dessert we ordered was phenomenal!!  I don't know the real greek word and I am too lazy to look it up but it was some type of custard in a phyllo dough, baked, warm and ridiculously good.  It was big enough to share but I could have housed the whole thing on my own with no problem.    The place is not much to look at and the Blakeney location is sandwiched inbetween Brixx and Cold Stone so it gets a bit lost and a bit crazy on the weekends.  They can't really seat more than a table of 4 inside but they have a small outdoor patio.  Word on the street is they have another location...I think they said Stallings?  Somewhere out there.  Anyway, love them.  Far from where I live but worth the trip.  I need to try a few more things but this may be my go-to for Greek moving forward.",

The only thing keeping it from being a 5 is that my chicken was a bit too dry. The salad was very filling and delicious.   We exercised some restraint and didn't get dessert because we have up sugar.

(You order your meal at a small little counter while overlooking the grill/cooking area.)  We had an order of hummus w/ pita, chicken gyro with lemon oregano fries, and a greek salad w/ grilled chicken. Everything was delicious. I must say that I'm not a \"seasoned\" fry type of guy....in fact I HATE when fries have anything on them other than salt...and these fries were very good.   This was my first time here but I was very happy with the entire experience.

    "text": "Greco Fresh Grille is a tiny shop tucked in Blakeney between Five Guys and Brixx. The parking can be a chore but well worth it even if you have to walk a little distance.  Hands down the best for a gyro sandwich. The lamb is fresh. The flavor and texture far exceeds the normal pre-frozen strips you get at other places. The pita is soft and chewy and the homemade tzatziki sauce is delicious.   I often order the Greek salad and ask to have lamb meat added. The salad is light and the dressing is a perfect compliment. I only wish the salad itself was a little bigger.  Of course no meal here is complete without the fries. Lemon-oregano is my favorite. I eat way too many and savor every bite. Citrus, salt, herbs...mmmm!  The owner is wonderful and greets his patrons, cooks, busses tables, and mingles with the guests. He is invested in his business and customer service. The personal touch adds to a terrific lunch.  This is our go to Greek!",

It's shredded cabbage with arugula and green onions tossed with a yummy lemon dressing.  My description probably didn't give it justice but it's so good and it's nothing like coleslaw. I do recommend adding a protein, either the chicken or shrimp to elevate it to a meal.  It also comes with pita bread on the side.  My hubby usually gets the shrimp pita - it's so good!  The best part of his pita that you can make it a combo and get lemon & oregano fries!  It's an expectation for him to share his fries with me.   I admit that I tend to order the same thing but I will venture out one day and order the lamb burger, it sounds so good.   The service is always very friendly and attentive - especially with the quick service format.  You order at the register,  they give you a number and they'll bring your food to you.  Try it, I'm sure you'll like it.",

Parking is very tight in this corner of the shopping center -okay, parking is tight in the ENTIRE shopping center- so you will likely be parking a little ways from the restaurant.  The resturant is layed out a little oddly, so you are literally standing on top of the menu while you look at it. There is a nice back patio you can sit on that is close to the Blakeney Fountain.    The food came out quick and was delicious. Their Chicken Gyro was delicious.  They offer many different seasoning options for your fries, which I will definitely try the next time I am in.

Sure, parking is a bit of pain but once you find a spot you are totally in for a treat!   When I walked in there was Greek music playing and the aroma smelled simply delicious! There were two super friendly employees behind the counter and they definitely made my visit amazing!  I decided to try the chicken breast gyro and lemon and oregano fries. Holy Moly!!! The chicken was so tender and well seasoned! The pita bread was so fresh and mixed with that tzatzaki sauce....yum yum yum! There was nothing about this gyro that I didn't like! And those fries were freaking killer!! The tartness of the lemon and freshness and flavor from the oregano...two words: Simply delicious! I couldn't stop eating them!!! I only wish I had more...  I enjoyed the entire experience! My food was hot, the portion sizes were huge! And the best part of the visit, was that the employees came by and asked if my food was delicious or if I needed anything else!  I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu!

They did an excellent job and were very friendly.  The food was cooked to order and very fresh.    I went with the chicken souvlaki and it was delicious.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The fries were fresh and perfect!  My husband still says it is the best gyro in Charlotte.  We are looking forward to going back more regularly.",

    "text": "Tucked in between the Five Guys and that God-forsaken Encore Bistro at the shopping center at Blakeney is this quaint and quite delicious Greek restaurant that adheres to simple options and a ginormous bowl of tasty.  I always lean towards the salad to start with, especially the Peasant Greek salata, chock full of giant tomatoes and a super generous serving of red onions, cucumber, and oil and vinegar. Sop all this up with generous serving of pita wedges. Feel free to ask for me, if you run out of pita wedges. And while you're at it, sample their hummus; choose from the traditional, or be bold and try whatever wacky-yet-gastronomically-awesome combination the Mad Hummus Scientist in the back's whipped up for you.  Main course, I can't stay away from the grilled chicken breast gyro. Generous, and I mean GENEROUS servings of diced chicken breasts, smothered (but not drowned) in tzatziki. DELISH!   You gotta have their hand-cut fries. Sure, you can play it safe and order the plain hand-cut fries, but be bold, the same way our Greek forefathers were bold, and plop your pretty little face into a basket of the lemon oregano fries. I could make a meal out of these delish little delights on a daily basis. Who cares if my arteries clog up with thick coats of peanut oil and lemon oregano? You only live once.  Everything here is clearly fresh and homemade, and if you the Greeks, you know they take their food seriously. They respect the dish, and you better damned well respect the dish too! Their homemade hummus and tzatziki is available for take out as well, so pick some up for home. Perfect for entertaining guests. Or yourself. Whatever works.  I also love the contemporary Greek pop music that's piped in on some Sirius XM radio feed. I'm noshing on my grilled chicken breast gyro and bopping my head to some Greek version of \"Call Me Maybe,\" and it occurs to me that my bopping may be misconsTrued as mockery. Oh, come on! I love \"Call Me Maybe,\" especially when sung in another language!  Also, as a side note, I've seen Steve Smith of the Panthers eat here a couple of times. If this place is good enough for the best player ever to wear a Panthers jersey (and why am I gushing, considering I'm a lifelong Giants fan?), then Greco Fresh Grille is good enough for me.  Another also: Steve Smith is really short for a wide receiver. I mean REALLY SHORT.",

    "text": "WOW WOW WOW!!!  This little hole in the wall is amazing!!  My best friends when I was a child were Orthodox Greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is Greek and she and her Mother make AWESOME Greek food.   With all of that being said, I'm a major Greek food snob and I have unreasonably high standards, as a result.  I have been to dozens of Greek restaurants over the years and a handful from Charlotte, NC to Columbia, SC and, hands-down...Greco is far superior to any other that I have been to.  The freshness of the ingredients, the flavors and seasonings, and the quality of the meat is just like my Greek friends have made me accustomed to.  I visited Greco for a late lunch.  Even at 2:00 on a weekday, there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as I was waiting.  The decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of Greece beautifully.  It has a bit of a Greek Diner feel, which I LOVE!  The service was fast and friendly and I enjoyed watching the chef  (owner, maybe??) prepare my food...\"FRESH' is the key word in the title here.  I watched intently and everything was homemade (Tzatziki, Greek dressing, Lamb patties, etc).  I ordered the Lamb Gyro combo with Lemon and Oregano Fries and a Peasant Salad.  The lamb patties for the Gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect Greek Lamb seasoning blend.  It's cooked on the grill-top to order (not made from greasy pre-fab mounds kept warm on a a spit).  This is real deal!!  The meat was moist, tender, and delicious!  It was served with housemade Tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita (I asked them to hold the onions).  The Tzatziki is made with yogurt, fresh shredded cucumbers, fresh herbs, and TONS of garlic....it's a flavor sensation!   The fries...OMG, the fries!!!  The most incredible seasoned fries I have ever tasted.  Tastes like traditional Greek Potatoes, but in french fry form (brilliant marketing move, BTW...everyone loves french fries!!).  French fries are fresh cut with skins, fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt, lemon juice, and oregano.  I will have dreams about these fries!  LOL   Last, but not least, is the Peasant Salad.  The Peasant Salad is everything that you love about a traditional Greek salad, minus the lettuce.  Giant wedges of plump red tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced seedless cucumbers (with the skin on), Kalamata Olives, and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.  Again, all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and hand-tossed with Greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.  Salad is served with warm pita wedges.   It was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge!  Salads can also be topped with their house-marinated Chicken or Shrimp or their yummy Lamb.  They also have a Vegetarian Pita made with Red Peppers, Eggplant, and Zucchini and a kids menu.  They also offer Whole Wheat Pitas for a mere .25 charge.  Prices are excellent as well.  I paid $15.00 (Gyro combo with Fries and a Drink and a full-sized Peasant Salad) and I made two meals out of it!  BTW, the Fries reheat perfectly in the oven!    If you are looking for heavy Greek dishes such as Pasticio, Baked Fish, or Leg of Lamb, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for delicious Greek quick dishes, this is a must-try!  I can't wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it!!!   I must try the Spanikopita next time!  I have a new favorite lunch place!!  Update Oct 8, 2012: I have been back 3-4 times since my original review and the 5-star rating still stands!  The service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.  My Husband, Son, and Mother have also eaten here with me and they love it, too.  I truly can't say enough about the house-made Gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time!   We have also tried the Spanikopita and it is very good, too!  This is \"the\" place for Gyros!",

    "text": "My husband is Greek.  100% Greek.  As in, Easter means the family roasts a whole lamb on a spit. Uncle Dimitri will offer you the whole head of the lamb.  Meaning our wedding, yes was very similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie.  AND...everyone's last name ends in OPOLOUS or ISIS.   We know Greek food!  Greco Fresh Grille is the real deal, and like the name says, FRESH.   GFG is bright and cheery inside, and immaculate.  There's a definite blue and white Greek theme going on-- but it's modern and fresh.    Most Greek restaurants, I'm sorry to say, don't serve real tzatziki sauce.  Most places use a cheap pre-made, preservatives-laden substitute, or they'll use sour cream.  (GROSS!  For sour cream, have Mexican food, mmmkay?) Not here.  You can tell the sauce is yogurt, you can tell someone has shredded cucumber into it, and the garlic is nice and strong.  Just how it should be.   Another pet peeve of most Greek joints, is the gyros are made from a pre-molded mystery meat that just gets shaved off a spit to look like it's the real deal.  It's not greasy and Pepto-Bismol-inducing.  It tastes distinctly of lamb and spices. The gyro is moist, the pita nicely warmed on the flat top, and full of flavor.  The really friendly woman who served it to us, suggested keeping the foil on, and unwrapping like a present as you ate, so not to make a mess!  My husband's lamb burger was delicious and unexpected.  Very clearly this was lamb, and it was served on a pita, not a bun.  Our only suggestion would be to season the patty itself more, and to include yogurt sauce with it.   Instead of fries with our combo, we subbed salads-- not the traditional salads, but the shredded cabbage and arugula one. (The Lahano) It was crisp and refreshing.  I'd like to have seen more arugula, but bottom line, it was a very nice accompaniment.   After we ate, my husband was in the mood for fries, after seeing someone else with a piping hot basket.  The lemon oregano fries are killer!  Think hot, fresh FIVE GUYS-like fries with the skins on...and freshly cut...except crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside.  Then add plenty of lemon juice for tart...salt and oregano...mmm, we ate it all!  After overhearing another customer say \"...since I had the hummus here, I can't eat the stuff at the supermarket...\" we asked the cashier if she thought the hummus was good.  She said it was great, and gave us a small sample cup with two flavors, a traditional one and a roasted red pepper feta.  Alongside, were 4 mini pita wedges.  Again, super fresh. (I'm used to more tahini in mine, but I suppose this is different than Lebanese hummus.)   The most rockin' way to end a meal...the galaktompoureko.  This is a traditional Greek dessert made of an eggy, custard, set with farina, between sheets of buttery phyllo.  HOLY MOLY don't tell my mother-in-law...but this is the best version I've ever had.  It's flavored with orange zest, and super light but creamy and milky....oh how to describe it.  Just give it a try.  If you like flan and rice pudding you'll like this.   Bottom line, we were really impressed to find a Greek place that does things right.  They're owned by Greek people, and obviously hire good employees, because every single person we talked with was kind and helpful.   My only wish, is there was a Greco Fresh closer to where I live!",

I don't know why we waited so long but it still pains me to think of all those months I missed of spectacular greek food less than two miles away in Blakeney.    Growing up in the Greek Orthodox church, being a foodie, and spending our honeymoon in Greece, I am very picky about my greek food from the quality of the meats, to the tzatziki sauce and pitas, to the salads, and the dressings.  My ultimate favorite dish they serve is the lamb gyro.  The meat is by FAR the best in town.  Hot, flavorful, and with just the right amount of tzatziki and olive oil...mmm, my mouth is watering now.  DO NOT overlook having fries with your gyro!  So many greek places have those fat, undercooked, unflavorful fries that I CAN'T stand!  Not here.  The Greco Fresh fries are hand cut, served hot, and if you want, drizzled with lemon juice and topped with oregano, that's right, superb! (I like mine with tzatziki sauce for dipping).     My wife loves the peasant salad which I always have to help her finish.  If you're not familiar with a peasant salad, it's just the good stuff, no lettuce filler.  Think fresh cucumbers, green peppers, onions (if you want), tomatoes, olives, lots of feta, and of course, their delicious house made dressing.  You can't go wrong with this salad.  This is the way salad should be, why waste space with lettuce that has no taste.    One word of caution, the homemade tzatziki sauce stays on the breath for a while if you eat as much as I do so come packing a few pieces of gum for after your meal, especially if going back to work.  They also have Cheerwine on tap which is the shizzle if you are a True born and raised North Carolinian.    The customer service there is top notch, probably the best in Ballantyne, and the owner always walks around if he has time and talks and jokes with his customers.  The one comment about the \"greek\" guy who was angry about the baklava being store bought obviously needs to have his greek cred checked.  Maybe it didn't taste like your mommas but it is definitely not from any store. Not only are the desserts baked in house, the owner's wife makes them which is why they sometimes don't have galaktoboureko, doesn't get more small business greek than that.  With that being said, go eat at Greco Fresh and enjoy!  Maybe you'll see us there tonight as well...",

    "text": "Restaurant motto of their Greek Food, fast, fresh, delicious seems to fit the bill of fare. My dining  mate and I ordered the traditional Greek Salad with  added felafel. Tzadiki sauce was offered at 50 cents additional . Salads came in full or side salad sizes, $6.95/ $3.95  Proteins are $3-$4  additional.  The menu also featured gyros, pitas, side items as spinach pie, grape leaves, hummus, kids menu and sweets such as baklava, fried honey balls, custard dessert encased in phyllo etc.  Lamb or Angus burgers on the menu too and  menu prices reasonable. The pita bread that came with our salad was soft, warm and fresh and obviously not microwaved  as it remained soft. The felafel were good, crunchIy on the outside but a bit dry inside  in our opinion. All the vegetable salad  ingredients were fresh and tasty. One ordered at the counter, and food brought to the table. The restaurant appeared clean and neat but decor a bit bland. The staff seemed friendly and attentive. I would return and try another menu item. My dining mate had eaten there before, said his chicken gyro was very tasty but surprisingly  small",

I have a good friend who recently moved his office and can't get there for lunch any longer, and it is one one thing he said he misses the most.  My girl friend loves their veggie pita and fries.

    "text": "This is a very good little Greek joint amid a throng of chain restaurants in the very popular south Charlotte shopping area known as Blakeney. As locals, my wife and I know to avoid this area at dinnertime due to the crowds and stick to lunches only. Parking is an issue almost anytime but especially after 6:00pm. The fact that it is dominated almost exclusively by chains can make dining in this area somewhat ho-hum which makes Greco Fresh Grille refreshing and appealing. It does have two other Charlotte locations but doesn't feel like a chain, in fact, it is family run and that is reflected in its quality and service. The inside eating area is small and narrow but it does have a fantastic outside area.  I've eaten here a dozen times or so and always get the traditional Gyro with Lemon Pepper fries and have found both to be very satisfying. One oddity however that I didn't notice until I ate at the Colony Road location is that (as some reviews have noted) the Lemon Pepper fries served here are served somewhat soggy with sauce compared to the other location. I like the less soggy type and go now to Colony Road location solely for this reason. The manager insists they are prepared the same way so you'll have to check for yourself but I assure you there is a difference. (I'm not about to argue with a Greek restaurant owner.) Either way they are a must and the serving size is huge.  The fact that I eat here so regularly alone should imply that I think it's pretty good. We are suddenly blessed by plethora of Greek/Mediterranean choices in south Charlotte and I'd rate this among the best.",

    "text": "CHECK THE MENU PRICES AND YOUR ORDER TOTAL BEFORE YOU PAY!!!  Ok, I just had to get that out before I start my review. I went to Greco a little after the lunch time rush after seeing the awesome reviews on Yelp. When I walked in only a couple of tables were seated. I reviewed the huge menu posted and proceeded to the register to place my ToGo order. I knew that I wanted the Platter, but I wasn't quite sure which meat I wanted. I had a taste for some beef so I asked if they offered Steak or Beef, he said no. I then asked what Kefte and falafel were (I don't have much Greek cuisine experience), he said Kefte was a beef patty *blank stare* sir can I have the Kefte platter please!! I ordered it with Lemon Oregano fries and the Greek Salad that the menu says it comes with. Kind of irritated I handed him my card not even paying attention to the cost. I sat down to sign the receipt and noticed it had a total of $16.28!! Now WAYMENT!!! I know that menu says $9.95 for Kefte! I checked the board and the printed menu before bringing it to his attention. He then tries to tell me that the platter doesn't come with Kefte and that he instead charged me for Grilled Kefte and added a salad since it doesn't come with one. But err-uhhh the menu clearly lists Kefte as an option for the platter. We walked over to the board TWICE as he continued to argue with me about it. He then eventually says, ok the platter costs more with Kefte and it'll be $10.95 before tax. At this point I just looked at him totally confused. He then comes back and says ok i'll charge you $10.95 and give you $1 in cash and you pay the $9.95. I ended up paying $10.96 with that credit in cash.   When I got back to the office I was completely underwhelmed. The Salad, was just SAD! Just looking at it didn't have me at all excited to eat it. That's all I have for that, ended up rotting in my fridge. The Kefte was just ok. The beef with dry and tough. The fries were soft and lacked flavor. Probably needed salt. I tasted a hint of Lemon here and there but other than that, nothing. The best part of the meal with the Pita Wedges. I ate all of those. I'm not sure if it was because I ordered Togo, or maybe they gave me lackluster food because I demanded I be charged the correct price, but my food was not as good as the reviews rave about.  I now see a few people note that their meal price seemed to come out higher than the menu. And i'm telling you that this is not just a coincidence! I'll definitely not be returning again, but if you go, check prices before you pay because they are as crooked as they come!!",

I've ate at enough Greek restaurants and gyro food trucks up north to know the difference. I was expecting my gyro to be prepared a certain way. Unfortunately, the lamb meat was cooked on a flat grill and it doesn't taste the same to me. If a restaurant is going to use a flat grill to \"warm up\" the meat versus cooking it on a spinning griller. I can simply cook my own gyro at home. It taste better when the meat is cooked and sliced on the grill spinner.    Where are the restaurants that cook the gyro meat on the spinning griller??",

So when I found Greco fresh years ago I fell in love with it. Let me explain. There are dozens of Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in every city. Seems Greeks love the food biz.  If you like an awesome quick-service Greek anytime of day then you'll LOVE Greco. I promise! Give it a try. It ROCKS! THIS IS NOT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!!! First of all Mia is very friendly. But what makes the place a favorite of mine is the fresh ingredients in each dish. The Greek Salad is perfect with JUST the right amount of oil and vinegar. The Feta is amazing! Perfectly slightly brined JUST like I like it. The olives are authentic, not some bland olives bought at Walmart. Do yourself a favor...try the Salmon Pita. And if you're not watching what you eat...HECK, even if you are, try the lemon oregano fries. You can't eat just 1!!! I've been to 3 of the Greco's and the food is always perfect and brings me back time and time again.",

Not sure how this place gets an award for the best fries. If it were to me I would give them the award for the worst and burnt fries.",

The smoke and grease was thick inside the restaurant. We tried to eat inside but couldn't handle the air quality. We went outside and sat in the 90+ heat. Not ideal. When we got home both my kids and I had to change our clothes they smelled so badly. Please get the kitchen fan working again or I will not be able to enjoy this restaurant.",

Only slightly messy, which it's kind of supposed to be. Delicious!  Cute little restaurant. Not quite first date material but certainly great for a meet up.",

I've never had a bad experience here.  It's as simple as can be -- you look at their huge menu as you walk in, order at the counter, and they bring their food to you.  There are pretty good options, although I always get one of their Gyros.  I prefer Chicken to Traditional (lamb), but both are good.  Also, you can make it a combo for about $3 extra. I've gotten their hummus and pita, which was delicious, but I really dig their fries.  They've got 4 flavors -- lemon oregano, cumin and garlic, sea salt, and spicy.  My favorite?  The spicy.  I really want to try their grape leaves next time.  I could go on about the food, but their service is fantastic too.  They're friendly, make good recommendations and serve you with smiles on their faces.  All this makes for a 5-star experience.",

Cashier answered all our questions and was very sweet.  I got the shrimp pita sandwich and spicy fries. Shrimp was delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would ask for is extra red onions. Tatziki sauce went well with it. Spicy fries were good but had a lot of seasoning on it. Some people might like that, but I rather have them lightly seasoned. They also had other flavors of fries. My husband got the chicken pita sandwich and a greek salad. Salad was very fresh. Chicken was good. Very filling. Came with a lot of meat. Both of our meals came with drinks and after our 20% off coupon, it was only $18.   I would definitely come back!",

You also get pita bread with your salad, which tastes wonderfully fresh! The salad dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette that is light and tasty.   Their grape leaves appetizer is also another favorite with yummy seasoned meat. We usually get their salads to be healthy! Parking is sometimes difficult in the Blakeney area but we think the food is worth it and definitely fabulous!!",

    "text": "Thanks to the weekly yelp e-mail last week, we decided to travel out to Greco Fresh Grille for lunch on Sunday.  My husband had the traditional gyro with lamb and I had the chicken gyro.  We split the large lemon fries.  They do not cut you short on the portion size.  The large fries were way too much for the two of us, but they were sure good!  Subtle hint of flavors, but enough to notice and have something different.  As far as the gyros go, they were some of the best we have had!  They are packed full of meat and both the lamb and chicken had some awesome seasoning/flavor to them!!  The only cons came from my husband, which I do agree with his first con - the location, great location for people in Ballantyne, but not great for us, maybe they will get another location in Rivergate.  We will come back, but it just won't be frequently.  My husbands other con, the sweet tea was not very sweet!    They have a fantastic outdoor seating area - all for the neighboring restaurants as well, but we got to bring the dog and enjoy the nice spring weather outside!   Overall, we would highly recommend this place for some flavorful Greek goodness!",

We were sitting outside. And we were amazed at how phenom this food was.   The tzatziki sauce tasted identical to my homemade one. Everything was prepared in the least messy way.

    "text": "Lately I have been craving Greek food and trying to find a good place that has flavorful twist to traditional Greek food. A cousin of mine told me about this place so we went and checked it out. It is located in South Charlotte, in the Blakeney shopping center. I got the grilled chicken breast gyro with cumin and garlic fries. They also offer lemon oregano fries and plain fries. The chicken is flavored well and grilled well. The chicken had a hint of lemon to it as well which mixed well with the tzatziki sauce. Inside the gyro is long cut onions, tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki sauce and chicken. The gyro is basic and there isn't anything unique about the dish until you get to the fries. This is the first time I have ever had cumin and garlic fries. My one concern about the fries was that there was going to be too much garlic. When I bit into the fries I was very surprised, the flavors of the cumin and garlic went very well together. The garlic was not over bearing at all and I would say I was very impressed with the fries. For about $8 to $9 you can have a chicken gyro and a very generous portion of fries. I have been back and I would go back again.",

My gyro was served brimming with fresh cut seasoned chicken breast in a warm pita accompanied by red onion, lettuce, tomato and tzatziki sauce.  The fries were fresh cut and seasoned perfectly (better than the 5 guys fries next door).  The baklava was baklava...they all kinda taste the same to me, though it was still delicious.  Prices are reasonable and the place was nice and clean.  Folks in the kitchen wear disposable gloves when preparing food, which was a welcom sight.",

And not to mention the baklava with or without ice cream  was outstanding either way!  Great atmosphere, nice Greek music, friendly staff and cheerful owner.

I am on a bit of a health kick, so I asked if they could serve one chicken kabob with a side of grilled veggies(not on the menu). The cashier was more than accommodating,  and said it wouldn't be a problem. A few minutes later, she brought out my food.  First i took a bite of the grilled veggies They were flavorful, and not too salty. Next came the AMAZING chicken kabob. With out a doubt,  the best I've ever had, and that's coming for a girl who loves Greek food. It was tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection with herbs/spices from the heavens.  I scarfed it down in 5 minutes! To top it all off, the owner and his staff were friendly & make you feel right at home. I will definitely be a regular at this place. It's a ten: great prices, fresh ingredients, and awesome service. I'm thrilled that I found this gem in South Charlotte! :)",

No two balls and 5lbs of lettuce. This was 97% falafel. Sauce was amazing. Pita fresh. Asked for a cup of hummus on the side, and I got a nice sized cup too.  Service was fast and she was very sweet too.   Sadly my toddler ate half of it on me, but just as excuse to go back for another.",

I dined in and sat outside on their patio area which was nice on a sunny day. My food was out within 10 minutes.   When I say the word FLAVOR I mean it.  The kebabs were seasoned so well and the lemon oregano fries just packed flavor all over them and the fries seemed to be fresh cut as well. The portion was more than enough I dont know If I even finished all of my fries.   I will definitely be back here and excited to see they are opening one near me in the future in the steele creak area! My quick and fast greek food fix.",

Management was very helpful at this location and they handled the problem very kindly. But sadly I will not and can not eat at this restaurant again due to these sanitary issues. I'm writing this review as a warning for others to always be cautious and check your food before you or your kids eat it! This is unacceptable as a restaurant to serve this with their food.",

Ever since the closing of Greek Isles (yes, I know, I'm living in the past and I have to let it go, but I CAN'T... a favorite is a favorite forever) I have looked and looked for a place that could match them in their making of Horiatiki (a traditional peasant salad with veg but no lettuce) with salmon... Now... this place isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close!  Beyond the salad... their gyros are incredible, and if you say the magic words \"double meat\" your gyro will magically have DOUBLE the meat... and it's insanely delicious!    Now, let's talk fries.  If you die before trying their lemon & oregano fries, you've done something wrong... get here and have a pile!  It's totally worth the carb spree!  Lastly - they hire the SWEETEST people who are always SO willing to go out of their way to make you feel awesome... SO - whether you eat in or take out at this little slice of Greek food heaven, you won't be sorry!  I'm so glad their near my home... Not sure what I'd do without them!",

Their garlic and cumin fries are out of this world and an order is definitely large enough to share.  The staff are super friendly.  It's also a nice place to eat if you want to grab a quick bite and eat outside while shopping at Blakeney.",

I appreciate having the option for whole wheat pita, even with the 25 cent upcharge.  Have tried both types of fries, lemon oregano and garlic cumin, and while they're sure to make any fry lover happy, I didn't find them particularly spectacular.  I prefer to opt for their hummus, with an interesting rotation of flavors, having tried the chipotle hummus which was good.  Prices are very reasonable, with pitas going for $6, with an extra $3 to make it a combo with fries or hummus and a drink.  Highly recommend for a quick lunch if you find yourself in the area.",

We love this place now. I always order a gyro, either chicken or falafel. The chicken is delicious, very simply prepared with tzatziki, tomato, lettuce and red onions, but still flavorful. The falafel is good, too. Sometimes a bit under-seasoned, but still good. My husband prefers the burger. It's seasoned well and you can add American, mozzarella or feta cheese. They have seasoned french fries, too. We like them all: lemon-oregano, cumin and garlic and, plain with sea salt. Their hummus is delicious too. The flavors change weekly, my favorite is probably the rosemary hummus. The restaurant itself is small but comfortable. It's in a great location within Blakeney. The staff is awesome. They're so nice and you can tell they take pride in what they do. Greco Fresh Grille is a great, quick Mediterranean restaurant.",

About $10 for the combo, which was a little more than I wanted to spend, but it was delicious. The tzatziki sauce with the fries were SO GOOD. Definitely homemade sauce. The gyro tasted really fresh and the lamb was obviously cooked fresh too. I personally like a little feta on my gyro, but that's alright...it may not be traditional Greek to have feta.

    "text": "Stopped here wanting a REAL gyro. So the husband & I met in this tight congested shopping center & walked in this nicely decorated eatery. There is a crisp decor & not overly done.  The staff is very friendly & helpful. There is a large menu hanging over the open kitchen area. A long counter in front of the cooking are does have s few stools to sit & eat or maybe wait for your take out order.  The are several small tables & seems to have a nice patio out back that would be a great place for a group.  At the end of the counter is where you order so after standing & looking up for several minutes we proceed to the register & order lamb gyros & make it a combo for $2.50 for, which gave us a drink & fries. We choose the lemon & oregano fried just for a change of pace!   We were given our paper drink cups & a number & found a table placed the number card in the stand & waited for just a little bit. Soon a girl brings our meals that are served in plastic diner basket with wax paper lining it. Gave us real silverware wrapped in a napkin.  opened up my gyro and my eyes just were so very wide looking at the massive amount shoved in this pita bread. ive never been given to much meat in one of these before! it was 2 slices (not super thin either!) nicely cooked with just a hint of pink in the center. Tzatziki  sauce fresh and placed on the bottom then a lot of sliced purple onion, some tomato slices and topped with that meat. the fries were really good, I didnt detect the lemon but hubs said he could sometimes. but the oregano was really nice. served with a small solo cup of ketchup. I think next time I might get some Tzatziki  sauce to dip them in!~  The drinks are a fill it yourself, so if eating in this is nice since you can fill er up before you leave. They had 2 tea urns, but i didnt see which was sweet and which was unsweet so I just went with soda.  my only negatives are that it was a little loud, people trying to talk over the loud greek radio type music/talking over head. also I found it really weird that neither my hubs or myself could get a cell signal in here! (AT&T). strange! we had to check in on yelp once we were done and walked outside.",

I've been back a few times  - not as often as I'd like because 22 miles is a long round trip for a Gyro - the fun has been going down but today, finally was just a big disappointing.   They no longer offer the delicious Melitzonasalata, I was told because locals are not interested. Galaktompureko sorry no we don't have any, I didn't see any spinach pie ... it's pretty much down to people lining up for Gyro and \"Greek\" fries.   Even the gyro (which is still good) is not what it used to be - more grease, less flavor ... is that pressed lamb meat? Not the same.  I brought home the Lahano salad, which turned out to be nothing but shredded cabbage with a tiny bit of Arugula, essentially $7 for a plate of slaw. Studying the menu after the fact I see I was supposed to spend an  additional $3-$4 for chicken or some other protein on top, Greek salad? I think not.    If enough people notice maybe the owners will raise their standards but I won't be holding my breath.",

As good as their sandwiches are, the fries are even better. Probably top five I've ever had, and some of the best seasoned.

    "text": "YUM!  Fresh is indeed the word for this place, what a delightful stop for a quick dinner.  The owner asked if it was my first time, how I had heard about them, etc. and I told him that I had seen some glowing reviews on Yelp and had to try it out for myself.  He laughed and said when the Yelpers like you, you're in good and when they don't it's not good.  :)  Such a charmer, excellent first impression, but I had to try the food.  As the other reviews have stated, Greco Fresh Grille is located at Blakeney along the restaurant row portion on the far end.  Parking - meh.  Directly in front of the restaurant is 15 minute parking, so swing on past that towards Bath and Body and Wells Fargo and you should have some luck.  At 5:30 on a Monday, I was a little ahead of the dinner rush, but as I was finishing, folks started to pour in.  I am glad I got there early, as I got a chance to speak with the owner.    The food: Grilled chicken gyro:  well seasoned white meat served on a warm pita with tzatziki (totally had to look that up) sauce, thinly sliced onions and tomatoes.  Delish!  It tasted bright and fresh, very good.   The fries:  I ordered the lemon with oregano fries (the owner said if you are getting fries to go, the plain or garlic/cumin is suggested as the lemon that is tossed with the fries can make them a tad soggy if you aren't going to eat them soon).  I liked them - different, tasty.  But he was kind enough to send over a sample of the garlic/cumin fries and they were AWESOME.  I like crispy (burned) fries, and these were perfect.  Lightly seasoned and such a tasty change from plain old salt.  Quite good! As Ben stated, they have the Pepsi (sigh), but they do have Cheerwine - YAY!  Awesome Greek music playing, but not loud or obtrusive at all.  If I had any friends to eat with, we could have easily carried on a conversation.  There is a TV that was on the Cooking channel when I was in with subtitles.    Friendly tip - your breath is going to be WHEEEEYEW from all of the deliciousness, so I wouldn't do this for a first date (or third, *wink*) or before a trip to your dentist (unless you hate your dentist), but any other time would be fabulous.  Great little spot, the owner and his staff are incredible and definitely made a great impression.  Come for the friendliness, stay for the food, I can't wait to go back and try some more food.",

The Gyro was Fantastic - Great Pita Bread, Red Onion, No lettuce (nice touch), Tomato and Tzatziki!  They have an \"Open Kitchen\" which I think always puts the customers at ease!  The fries are not what I like, (I'm real picky about fries, if you see my very short \"Fries\" list) and what does it matter, though they are fresh (Not frozen)!  The Salad dressing was good, not great (I'm very picky about EVERYTHING!!!)!  Then I had the Chicken Gyro with two sides of Tzatziki. Excellent!  The music was soft Greek sounding, relaxing, great dining music!  The Decor is Greek: Blue and White.  Very comfortable environment!  The service was Outstanding!  Superb!  Top Notch!!! Fast and Friendly!  Had lunch there today and they were busy and handling it with Skill!!!",

I felt the quality of the food was much more in line with what I was paying, and if I recall correctly, the inside of the restaurant has been improved. The oregano fries are a nice change, but I do think they go a tad heavy on the oregano. I thought the service was much better this go around. After my visit, I feel like I'll come back to this place more frequently.",

They definitely up charged for what I ordered and I have no idea what went wrong. The meat was seasoned well and juicy but nothing amazing. I'm pleased my tomatoes were properly ripe - nobody likes a soggy tomato. The fries had a fantastic cumin flavor that wasn't too heavy but the fries themselves were maybe overcooked? Bleh. I also got grape leaves. The filling was perfect but a little heavy on the lemon.  Overall the food I got (not ordered) was average and close-ish to authentic flavors. I'd have to eat in next time in case my order needs correcting again.",

    "text": "Finally ventured into this little Blakeney gem. My wife had been before and had great things to say so, needless to say, we were long overdue.   Resting amongst more attractive and simple options for suburban folk, I'm happy to say Greco Fresh Grille is local-biz lover's haven.   Small, shotgun setup on the inside and a handful of tables out back. The outdoor seating is great, but goes quite fast if it's a nice day. Get at it quick! Always nice to see filled tables at an off hour. Telltale sign this place is doing something right.   Friendly service behind the counter. Welcoming and helpful.   Here's our order:   Got cups for water. They have pepsi products. (No hard feelings. I'm just a coke guy through and through. I'll make an exception for Cheerwine, however. Viva NC)  Spinach Pie. To the Greek-savvy, Spanakopita. Amazing. The phyllo is perfectly crispy, flaky and crunches/dissolves with each bite. The spinach filling is savory and not too rich and creamy. Comes with 6 pieces, so perfect for a table of two. If you're sharing with more than two, you'll have to fight for more than one piece! I'd get this every time.   My wife got the veggie gyro. Great mix of roasted red peppers, cucumber, red onion and great tzatziki. I'm a fan. The pita is thick and chewy, but not offensively so. I'd be hard pressed to shove a few pieces of the spinach pie in this bad boy! Loved all of the textures and flavors. Not overpowering and a great veggie option.   I got the lamp gyro. Voted best in the QC by the Observer. I say rightfully so. Generous helping of lamb, balanced well with fresh veggies and, yet again, a nice slather of that great tzatziki. Each bite was great and I was only disappointed once it was gone.   Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $20 and were happily full!  Parking can be an issue, as there aren't many spaces directly in front of the shop. Not uncommon for Blakeney spots. I'd park over near the Starbucks.   Can't wait to head back and stuff my face with more Greek food. Opa!  Cheers.",

Greco isn't the most high-end, upscale restaurant on the inside, but you really shouldn't judge this little book by its cover.  The food and service is definitely A+.   The food at Greco is cheap cheap cheap but doesn't taste like it at all.  The best part of the meal is paying 3.00$ extra for Lemon-Oregano fries and a drink.  Getting an entree + fries + drink is a little too much food for just one person honestly so if you're looking to just be 'full' when you leave instead of 'super stuffed', maybe share the fries with a friend?    Lastly, they have baklava that's the size of my entire hand.  The baklava I've had before was the same price and literally the size of a quarter (but I kept paying for it because it was sooooo good).

Greco's Fresh Grill in the Blakeney area near Rea Rd and Ardrey Kell Roads is one of the best places in the area to go for fresh, quick, and reasonably priced, mostly authentic Greek food.    It is counter service.  Peruse the menu above the grills and sneezeguards, then order what you'd like and they'll bring it to your table. Lamb gyros, chicken gyros, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, lemon oregano fries, etc..  I have had the chicken gyro, the plain hummus, and the lemon oregano fries.  The gyro is delicious; they do not skimp on the chicken, and there is a lot of seasoning and oil on it.  Do NOT remove it from the foil lest you would like oil dripping all over you.  The hummus is probably the best I have had around here.  It's very fresh and there are no fillers in it.  The menu states \"If it's harder to pronounce than a Greek last name, then you shouldn't be eating it.\".  The lemon oregano fries are decent.  They are not necessarily my flavor preference, but they are good for what they are.  The people working, from the Greek cooks/owners, to the teenage girls usually running the register, are all very friendly.  So if you want a good, fresh gyro at a fair price in south Charlotte, Greco's is the place to go.",

Mmmmmm, I am hungry remembering the lamb burger on pita; wow...I call that happiness on a plate. Greek salad and shrimp pita are just some of my other favorites. Oh, I almost forgot the prices are so reasonable for the quality and if you want extra tzatiki, they don't nickel and dime you; they happily give you more with a smile. And they are family owned; very nice people. Gotta go; I need me some Greco love.",

    "text": "Went to Greco for a quick lunch after school today. Walking in, you notice the sleek decor paired with older Greek decorations. It's an interesting vibe they create, but they pull it off pretty well. I ordered the grilled chicken gyro. We sat outside, and our food was out in about ten minutes. My chicken was very very good. Fresh, and not chewy at all. Probably some of the best chicken I've had. The tzatziki was fresh and delicious, and the onions and tomatoes complimented the whole thing. The pita was also very good.  Service was fine, really not enough interaction to judge anything. Overall, if I was in a bind for time, I'd go again!",

    "text": "Employees are friendly and helpful so that's good.   However, I have had A LOT of Mediterranean food in my life, and this place falls short of the other comparable food taste I have experienced. Although everything is fresh and hot, the taste is not that flavorful and the portion sizes are smaller than other Mediterranean places I have been to like Kabob Grill, Troy or La Shish.    I have friends that are Arab and from the Mediterranean region so I know this cuisine pretty well, and I can say that I don't find the taste to be as authentic as my friends foods that I have had or other restaurant places I have tried.   I'm not saying the place is bad, just not great.",

    "text": "It was just ok. Very skimpy with meat portions. Daughter got shrimp platter, I got chicken platter and hubby got lamb platter. Greek salad was disappointing. Feta cheese was terrible. Consistency of tofu with feta flavoring.  Green peppers in Greek salad?  Never!!!!  But they did. Lamb was gristly and chicken was dry. Shrimp was good but overall meat portions very small for the hefty price. Won't go back.",

    "text": "Another update on Greco Fresh Grille as they've been open now for about six months. We stopped by last Saturday around 3PM and the place was hopping. Great to see they're doing such a brisk business.  They've added a few new items to their decor, and a few new specials to their menu. Pastitsio was listed as a special with the description of \"Greek Lasagne\" - sounded good but I was there for the gyro and fries.   The food was great, but I wish they'd offer a combo with side items other than fries. Perhaps some hummus or a small greek salad. It's so easy to go there and get a gyro and fries, and then leave feeling like you've eaten something as heavy as 5 Guys next door.  The owner is there every time I visit, and he stopped by to check on how things were going. This is still a winner of a place to me. It's exactly what I'd hoped for when they opened.",

You order with the cashier and they bring your food to the table.  My husband had the gyro platter and I had the lamb burger.  Everything was hot and fresh.  We were very happy with our meals and will definitely return whenever we are in the area.",
