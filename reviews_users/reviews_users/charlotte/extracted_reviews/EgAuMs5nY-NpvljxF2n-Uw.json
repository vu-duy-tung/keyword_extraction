My husband loves the lovely basil tofu dish.  I think the flavors are good and for the most part I have enjoyed my food.  The goyza tonight were super yummy.  But for the second time my order of \"mild\" level heat was too hot for me to eat even half of my dish.  My husband ordered his hot tonight and tried mine and said he thought mine was hotter.  I ordered the cashew nut dish, and it also didn't have a single cashew in it.  Maybe it's puree in the sauce?  The flavor was good but my lips were too hot for me to enjoy it.   I have learned my lesson and will order \"no heat\" next time. I do recommend this place, but just caution others who may be heat sensitive like I am.  (Though I've ordered medium at other places and been fine!)",

Both the rangoon and the potstickers had delightfully thin and crispy wrappers which let the fillings shine.  The lovely hostess also offered a sample of a samosa-like appetizer that was similarly delish!  We are thrilled, thanks to our fellow Yelpers, to have been alerted to this wonderful addition to the asian restaurants in town.  If you're a fan of fresh, flavorful, plentiful asian cuisine served in a friendly and super clean setting, go here soon!!!",

Walked in and the owner was very kind. We ordered the chicken pad thai and veggie fried rice and we were amazed! I had actually ordered the veggie pad thai first but the owner was thoughtful enough to inform me that they use fish sauce in making their pad thai so I switched to the fried rice. The veggies were crisp and fresh and didn't feel like someone had defrosted my meal. The flavors were really great as well and they have a fair portion size (I was able to save the rest for lunch the next day)! My fiance had the chicken pad thai and he said that it tasted great, everything was cooked well and the flavor was what he was expecting. We had ordered an app as well, the spring rolls, and they were freshly fried and delicious. The owner even offered for us to try one each of the imitation crab and the curry wraps--both were fantastic.   If you're looking for a place with great food, great flavors, and a good portion size... then I would definitely recommed trying this place out! The prices are pretty standard for a Thai restaurant, but definitely worth it!",

A smile greeted us as soon as we entered followed up with impeccable service by the owner. He walked us through our vegetarian options and recommended the most delicious cuisines for us to enjoy. And boy did we ever! YUM! I dined on the \"vegetable panang curry\" while my husband chose the \"cashew nuts and more\" entree. We also selected the spring rolls and curry puffs for our apps. Luckily they served enough for us to enjoy leftovers tomorrow! We can hardly wait. The owner explained that he and his wife own and operate the restaurant while his mother-in-law whips up their family recipes in the kitchen. And, get this, they try to be eco friendly by serving all meals on compostable plates and use eco friendly utensils and cups. Love it! The concept is fast casual so it's great if you're pressed for time, but also suitable for date night and family affairs too. We were offered the donut dessert, but we simply couldn't fit another bite into our bellies. Next time, for sure! 2 apps + 2 entrees for less than $40.....just do it!",

I had the Totally Red Curry, Medium Spice, and it hit the perfect balance of creamy vs spicy with great Thai basil strewn throughout. If you get a curry get a 2nd order of rice though because it is a largeee amount of curry. Pad Thai for my wife (no spice) was a little bland but I usually think that about the dish regardless of preparation. Curry puffs were almost like curry samosas and were a great app.",

It felt like it was designed by the team at Fixer-Upper on TV! Ha ha The place was very clean! I ordered red curry shrimp which definitely varies from restaurant to restaurant however it was perfect. The shrimp could've been a little larger but the spice was perfect! I also ordered the curry puffs which were perfectly deep fried! I wish this couple the best of luck with their new restaurant!

My husband had the Thai Iced tea and the spice tray to add a kick to his entrees. You have to try the curry puffs filled with curry, onion, carrot and potato served with sweet chili sauce. The egg rolls are stuffed with clear noodles and vegetables. Their chicken satay is no served on a stick, but are large tender pieces of breast meat paired with peanut sauce. We never had Tom Kha Kai soup with so many mushrooms, the lemony notes have it a great balance. We also added two entrees (I know, it's a lot) of combination pad Thai and pineapple fried rice, which are some of their top sellers. The pad Thai noodles were smaller than normal which was a nice surprise and we always add garlic to ours. Since it was our first time, they also gave us free fried banana dessert. This cute little egg roll was topped with honey and powdered sugar. They use all disposable products so the food served add your table comes in the take out trays for easy packaging (we had a bag full of leftovers) and your given recycled paper plates and plastic ware. Seemed like a very efficient business model to us. Hope you don't wait long to enjoy for yourself!!!",

This place has by far the best green curry and pad thai I have EVER eaten, and I've had Thai everywhere from California to New York.  Aroy is seriously the best ever.  I am so happy to have found this place. Thank you for being in Charlotte!!!!",

    "text": "Finally, a Thai restaurant on the East side! Yelp sent us to them! We weren't disappointed! Graciously greeted and served. We stopped in for lunch Saturday afternoon. You're seated and given a menu to look over and once you decide you go to the front counter and place your order and pay. We started with the Curry Puffs and Pak Pak (Papaya) Salad. The Curry Puffs and dipping sauce were so tasty and the Pak Pak was outstanding! The papaya, peanuts, and tomato in the salad were a wonderful sensation of taste and flavor! My wife had the Pad Thai with Tofu (no spice) and the sauce on the noodle was delicious and the tofu cooked perfectly! I had the Panang Curry with chicken (medium) and it was some of the best I've ever had! We both had a Thai Tea (very good) and a fried banana! It was a wonderful lunch.  The lunch specials are perfectly proportioned and priced very reasonably! The husband and wife team were so nice and wonderful to talk with! Mom's in the kitchen cooking and you can tell as it has a home-cooked flavor! We really can't wait to go back and highly recommend that you give them a try!",

They make you feel welcome and right at home and you can tell they are genuinely excited to be a part of the Eastland community. Go check this place out and let's all make sure they grow and are here to stay!",

    "text": "Nice to have a Thai restaurant in East Charlotte. Love the place. Didn't get 5 stars because not all we ordered were perfect. It gets a 4.9   You pick where you want to sit. Someone gives you a menu and tells you how the place work. Once you know what you want, you go to the counter and place your order and pay. They bring out the food in to-go containers. Once you finish, you clear your own table.  Curry puff is a yellow curry veggie filling in a wonton skin, it's fried and comes with a sweet/tangy dipping sauce. Very good. Very original.  Papaya salad was has a tany, sweet and spicy sauce mixed with shredded crunchy green papaya,tomato and peanut. I liked it, husband thought it would be better if less sweet.  Tom yum soup was not to my husband liking. He felt it lacked flavor.  Panang curry is my favorite type of curry, it's the most flavorful out of all curry. A very subtle peanut note. Very good. Had plenty of sauce to take home and mix with rice for lunch.  Pad Thai noodle was the right balance between salt, spicy, tangy, and sweet. Noodle were cooked just right, al dente.   Fried donuts come with a condensed milk sauce. Who knew you can take biscuits, deep fry it and it come out great. I inhaled it in 5 minuets.  Recommend this place. Will come back soon. The young couples are very friendly and great service.",

The order was supposed to take 20 minutes and took 55, and when it came out-- there were no gyozas for the lunch special, and they forgot rice on one of the two platters. We were excited to try this place, and went out of our way to do so. However, I definitely feel like I wasted 35 dollars and don't think we'll be making our way back.",

I got the pad see ew with chicken and papaya salad. Get it spicy! Makes the flavor kick. I'm Cambodian and I know my southeast Asian cuisine very well... this Thai restaurant's food is supreme. Tastes like home! Flavor packed and not over cooked or bland. Portions are also large, it could be shared between two people. It is located off the busy 74 freeway but there is an additional lane dedicated to turning into the shopping center so it wasn't that bad entering and exiting the lot. It's off the beaten popular streets of Charlotte but it's so worth it to hit up this place! I know I will be a regular. Give them your business, you won't regret it!",

Crab Rangoon was filled and delicious!   We also ordred the Garlic Pork, which was an entree and that was good, very garlicky and had lots of Mushrooms. We had the Panang Curry, the Sauce was so good I could have done shots of it! Outstanding Curry Sauce, Not too much chicken. Fried Rice was good, but could have been a little more flavorful. We also ordered a dish which was supposed to be very spicy and hot but basically was onions and not very hot. Very clean little place and great owners. They gave us a couple of their deep fried donuts for dessert!  I would go back for the Appetizers and the Curry for sure ! Oh and the Thai Iced Tea was delicious!!",

Previously the plateware, cutlery and cups were mostly recyclable products. Now they are plastic. None of it is recycled. No plates to wash to lower costs I'm sure but at least before I felt like my consumption of product would be recycled. Oh and the plastic forks broke and I was unable to finish my meal because I couldn't find the pieces. (Hmm, maybe I'll bring my own metal cutlery next time.) The (2) waters arrived with ice in the cup accompanied by little specs of 'flavor' in the water. That was gross. I ordered a very simple shrimp pad Thai. Previously when I ordered it the noodles we're longer then 3 inches AND the taste of so much ketchup was absent. Maybe the recipe changed slightly? My partners red curry also tasted of ketchup. I don't make Thai food but I didn't think it was ketchup based. The service was fine, aside from the gal taking a call while we ordered, in person, at the establishment. Maybe times are tough and gotta get those orders in. We won't be back. Time to find another local Thai place.",

Our meal was to-go, and I love that the containers for the fried items had vents (so that they dont get soggy). My hubby said the shrimps in a blanket were unique, unlike anything he's ever had -- and they were delish. Our entrees were cooked to perfection and again, really authentic in flavor.

    "text": "I believe this restaurant is at the same location where Fu Lin used to be. They did a good job in redecorating the place, 5 star for ambiance. We ordered Pad Thai with shrimp, papaya salad and tilapia with garlic2 sauce. The papaya salad has a good taste. $8.50 is little too expensive for shredded papaya. The pad Thai is too sweet and over cooked for us. In order to be eatable, we have to pour a lot of lime juice (2 star). As for the fish, i was expecting a whole tilapia fish. The taste is pretty good. It would be better if they would use less salt.  So disappointing that we still cannot find an authentic Thai food in CHARLOTTE.",

    "text": "This review comes after my third time choosing Aroy Thai for dinner.   The young couple who own? manage? The place are really sweet and have a fun story and interacting with them on our first visit was a plus and the food was solid!  Some reviews complain that the food is served on plastic (and that's not too environmentally conscious) but my girlfriend actually liked that everything left uneaten was already to-go ready and maybe that model is cheaper for a newer restaurant than buying expensive flatware.   The second time I went I placed on order online through their website.  Apparently they had some issues with this ordering system and have since changed to a new system but on this occasion, their original site still accepted orders and so I got mine together, submitted and went to go pick it up.  Upon arrival, I learned that they had been having issues with that system and that my order had not been received but they would begin it at that time and so I waited for 20ish minutes on that.  I wasn't in a huge hurry, technical difficulties happen. When we got our order, 2 out of our 5 items was wrong.  The third time I tried to order online using the NEW system.  I placed my order, saw the 25 minute time estimate, signed up for text alerts about order progress and arrived at the restaurant 25 minutes later.  When I arrived, the door was closed and locked and a sheet of paper said \"closed today for internet issues.\"   I tried the door just to check- maybe it was an issue processing credit cards in house but, since I had paid my order online and it had gone through, maybe they were still able to process it?    After I tried the door and went to the car to come up with a new food plan, I THEN received a text update that my order was canceled and the store was closed.  However, I had already driven all the way to the restaurant (20ish minutes one way).  So, that wasn't helpful...  I think maybe I've just been unlucky with Aroy Thai, but in each of the times where they was some issue with technology, the employees didn't seem too concerned about the inconvenience of waiting 20 minutes while they start an order that I thought would be prepared or driving 40 minutes that could have been avoided if they were monitoring their online site and could have messaged the the order was canceled BEFORE the pickup time, or if they had disabled online ordering since they were closed.  I understand that sometimes things happen but I was absolutely unimpressed at their desire/willingness to fix the issue or try to apologize for the inconvenience or to try to give some kind of incentive to come back.  I love when a place will give out a discount/coupon/free item or something just as a gesture when some unavoidable thing happens.     For me, the food isn't good enough for the customer service to be as poor as it has been.",

I hope they'll offer fresh spring rolls in the near future.  The chicken pad Thai was like any other Thai spot.  The spice was close to the crushed peanut side which snuck up on me although I ordered mild.",

    "text": "Just recently returned from a trip to Thailand, I was searching for a restaurant with authentic Thai food. So given that disclaimer I had a really good idea on what Thai food should taste. So one day driving down Independence I noticed the sign for Aroy Thai restaurant and decided to pull over and try out their traditional Pad Thai dish. As soon as I walked in I was greeted kindly and immediately felt welcomed.   I was told they had a to go style service which I'm not accustomed to but had no issues with it whatsoever. I ordered a mild spicy Pad Thai and a Thai iced tea. As I was waiting for the food I noticed the decor was very nice and cozy nothing fancy but just right the restaurant. When the food arrived at the table, (which didn't take long) I immediately felt like I was about to eat an authentic pad Thai dish and boy was I right!!   The level of spiciness was perfect for being a mild spicy pad Thai dish. The choice of ingredients were very similar to the ones I tried in Thailand. The Thai iced tea was delicious and the quality of service was extremely good, I couldn't have been more satisfied. As I was enjoying my pad Thai dish I was offered a curry puff appetizer to taste for being a first time customer which was delicious and a really nice gesture.   I would highly recommend Aroy Thai restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic Thai food and Thai hospitality in the Matthews area. Try their curry puffs and shrimp shumai appetizers for starters, followed by Pad See Ew or their famous Pad Thai dish for an entree accompanied by a delicious Thai tea. I hope everyone has the same enjoyable experience I had while eating at this restaurant. Cheers!",

This small restaurant is modernly decorated with a few indoor tables. They seat you with menus and when you are ready you walk up to the counter, order, and pay.  My only complaint is that food is served in plastic (I am not a big fan of that but if you don't mind then you'll have a wonderful experience).  The food was good! We had crab rangoons (SO GOOD) and the shrimp blankets as an appetizer.  For dinner, I had the Kom Kha Ka soup (may have spelled that wrong) which is a zesty soup with lemongrass and mushrooms.",

I didn't expect to bite into the shells on the small shrimp. 2 mussels in shell shell also. It's was more like regular rice with some soy added for color. I gave the star because the serving size of the rice was excellent even though I'm not so sure I'll be eating it. Maybe eating in house makes a big difference. I'll not be finding out anytime soon.",

We went for lunch during the week and although we were the only seated guests, a few people came in for take-out during our time there. From the moment we entered, you could tell the owners were passionate about what they do and the customer service was top of the line-especially for a casual restaurant.   You order and pay at the desk, but then the food is brought to you. I ordered the Ultimate Garlic Lunch Special with Chicken-Mild Spicy and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Sour Lunch Special with Chicken-Hot. They also let us sample the Crab Rangoon's since it was our first visit. We both really enjoyed our meals. The only thing we didn't love were the Rangoon's (too much cream cheese, in my opinion) but they were free, so who's complaining?  All in all, it's very exciting to have this spot on the east side, and we may take advantage of the carry-out in the future.",

    "text": "WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  This used to be our favorite Thai place in Charlotte, and WOW did it ever change.    They closed down for a couple of weeks for \"renovations\" -- okay, fair enough.  Then, we come to learn that it's under new management, and that they're bringing in a new chef.  This made us nervous, but little did we know what we were in for.  What used to be huge portions of delicious food became minimalist takeout portions of food nowhere near as good as what it used to be.  What used to be the sweetest woman on the phone turned into a man that couldn't be more impolite.  On top of everything else, they stopped taking DoorDash orders, which is where we'd order Aroy at least once a week.  They took everything we loved about this business, and did exactly the opposite.  What.  A.  Shame.  It used to be such a gem.  Time to find a new Thai place, I suppose.",

It's really more of a take out restaurant than a sit down restaurant. Thy do have tables available to sit, but you order at the counter and then they will bring it out if you choose to eat there.   The pad Thai (medium spice) was pretty good. I asked for extra spices to add later if I needed to (which I did). There could've been more of the pad Thai sauce on it, it was a tad dry.  The staff was really nice. I would come back again. It's literally within walking distance to my house. So it's very convenient.",

In this case, Aroy Thai keep things simple - generally a good idea. You come in and order at the counter (another idea that seems to be spreading) and a short while later your food is delivered.  The staff is friendly, and while the space is small, it is nice. Though they have plastic utensils at the serve-yourself area, they will deliver the regular/silver kind when they bring your food.  One thing that is a bit odd is the portion size. With one dish, a large ball of rice and some veggies. With another - a more traditional pad thai - a rather large plate.  Nothing wrong with it, exactly, and likely that the veggies cost more. It's just a bit of a stark difference when they sit next to each other is all. The quality of the food is certainly tasty.",

There's only about 8 tables so you don't have too many choices. They bring you a menu and then you go to the counter to order.   Everything comes on disposable plates and cups so you also clean up after yourself.   Th menu has traditional Thai dishes with creative adjectives. I went with what I usually get to sample a Thai menu - lovely basil with chicken. Lunch also came with 2 potstickers. I also ordered brown rice which was $1 more.   The dish was good. Nice flavors and tender chicken. I ordered Thai spicy and while it had a good heat to it, the spice was also flavorful but didn't linger like I normally like.   The staff was great. Super friendly and helpful and also gracious for me coming in.  It's an interesting way to do things and probably because they are new. The food is good and was definitely worth stopping.",

It was an amazing experience that I had everyone was great the owners and one of the manger thomas. I would recommend this place too everyone and anyone that loves asian food especially if it is thai food.

We ordered a papaya salad (3 stars), a shrimp Pad Thai (1 star) and Deep Fried Tilapia with garlic sauce (3 stars). The papaya salad is pretty good, but pricey for a salad without any shrimp in it. The Pad Thai is a major disappointment. Not only it's way too sweet, but also the noodle was too soft! We had to ask for fresh lime and drenched it the lime for the Pad Thai to be edible. The only decent dish was the deep fried Tapia with garlic sauce.   I can only give 2 stars for the food and 3 starts for the Service and ambiance. Sad to give an overall 3 stars for this new Thai restaurant in town:(",

    "text": "Two days after writing my review and I already need to update so I can add some more fun facts and tid-bits.   Yet another fabulous strip mall gem on Independence Boulevard. This one is tucked away in the Independence Promenade shopping center (other businesses here include The Red Door, Crazy Horse, Neck Breakers, and Hispanic grocery superstore Supermercado La Unica).  Originally, they were just going to open a take out spot. They wanted to provide people with affordable, quality food. When they saw that the space was bigger than they had thought, they decided to add dining. They've decorated really well. It's cute and cozy. You feel like you're eating at someone's house. It still has the take-out feel. You order and pay at the counter, then your food is brought out to your table.  Your food is served on disposable plates.  There are lunch specials every day from 11am-3pm, $7.95-$9.95 depending on your protein. Each come with two pieces of gyoza. The Totally Red Curry is their best seller. I've tried the Pad Thai with chicken, Ginger & Bell with shrimp, Sweet & Sour shrimp, and the Tom Kha Kai soup (comfort in a bowl). Appetizer-wise, the curry puffs are delicious. Even if you don't like curry, you'll like this. It's not a lot of curry, so it doesn't hit you in the face. The thai iced tea is dangerous (I say that because I could easily drink a gallon of it). Note: you can order pickup online on their website. There is also Doordash delivery for a limited area.   The owners are so sweet. You'll usually find Meghan behind the counter. My first visit, she fully explained the menu, walked us through the process of ordering and dining. Since it was our first time there, she brought us each a fried donut with a condensed milk dipping sauce. So good. My next visit, she remembered my first visit, even down to where we were sitting and what my lunch companion was wearing. Amazing.   Support this great local business!",

We were greeted by the sweetest hostess who immediately pushed two tables together for our party of five and brought us menus, explaining that you order at the front counter and then they bring the food to you. The restaurant itself is really cozy. It almost feels like a country-style, home cooking place rather than a Thai restaurant, but no complaints about that here!   For lunch, I went with the Totally Red Curry, medium spicy, with chicken and added veggies for $1 more. The lunch portion is huge and comes with two pork gyoza and white rice. (All for $12 WITH tip, y'all. Such a great deal!) The medium spice level was perfect for me! It had some heat but also didn't burn my face off. They have five levels from no spice on one end to Thai spicy on the other. Not going to lie, Thai spicy terrifies me.    Every one else in my group ordered the Pad Thai with various takes on the protein and spice level. Each variety looked delicious. I may try the tofu next time! One particularly kind friend shared a bit of her Thai Iced Tea with me. Holy cow, y'all! Hook me up to an IV and just pump that stuff into me 24-7. It is like crack! Sweet and creamy but with a fresh, light tea flavor at the same time. I'm hooked!   After our meal, the lovely hostess was kind enough to bring us a complementary dessert of fried dough and a condensed milk dipping sauce. It was the perfect sweet ending to the meal, cooling down my mouth which was a little tingly from my medium spice curry at that point.   We are excited to have Aroy so close by our East. Charlotte office! When you work off Idlewild Road, you sort of resign yourself to being in a good restaurant desert. However, with the addition of Cooking Pot and now Aroy Thai, things have been looking up for our little neighborhood recently!",

I was not overly thrilled that we had to order our meal at the counter.  I was not thrilled that they didn't have brewed iced tea, though they made me some hot tea and put ice in it.  I was not thrilled that I had to go get my silverware and my sweetener for  tea.  The other lady who works there walked over to the shelf where they were and told me that I could get my Sweet and Low there.  She was standing right next to those pink packets and could have so easily offered to bring me one!   The atmosphere makes it seem like it's a farm house. There was nothing about it that made you feel that you were in a Thai place!  It was eerily quiet.   The location is a bit dicey.  It is in a strip center next to a strip club!  Gives new meaning to a strip center, huh?   All in all, good food. Nice people.  Just nothing to make me jump up and down, but still good.    This part of town probably needed a restaurant like this, so I give them a big shout out for adding Thai flavor to the neighborhood. Besides, a good Thai meal before the strip show next door would make any hungry man happy, right?",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place given the glowing reviews.  Unfortunately, it left me disappointed.    I found it a bit weird that we had to order at the counter and we felt rushed.    We started with a couple of apps which were simply poor.  Trader Joe's frozen pot stickers and dumplings are better.  Pretty much felt like a rip off.    We got one curry dish and one noodle dish.  Both were Ok.  Just Ok.    There's simply no reason for me to every go back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "What a hidden gem!  My husband and I recently moved to Mint Hill from Washington DC and were looking for good Thai food, close to our house.  Don't let the location deter you!  It's located between what looked like a strip club and a lingerie store, but the restaurant is clean and immaculately decorated inside.    You get menus at your table and order at the window at the front of the restaurant.  I loved the casual feel but upscale atmosphere.  We shared the crab Rangoon (one of their specialties!) and both had the combination pad Thai.  Both dishes were excellent!  I've been to Thailand and eaten tons of authentic Thai food in DC and this was up there with the best.  The food came out piping hot and fresh and the flavor was delicious.  They also brought it samples of their curry puffs, which they said were another one of their specialties.  The husband and wife team running the restaurant were so nice and we had such a fun time chatting with them.  We can't wait to go back and try other dishes!",

We drove twenty minutes from our house to try out this place and we were not disappointed! We absolutely love Thai food and Aroy Thai served us the best Pad Thai we ever had. By far the best Thai place we tried here in Charlotte. Not only was the food amazing, the staff was so kind and attending and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute and modern. We will most definitely be returning.",

It's a very simple restaurant, small with a few tables but very serene atmosphere. The servers are so nice and helpful. I had the Pad Thai and the shrimp yellow curry and they were both really good. The portion sizes were huge. I'm looking forward to making this my new hangout for Thai food.",
