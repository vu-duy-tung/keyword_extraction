I just really dig in when I am craving a packed salad enough to shell out nearly 9 bucks (rabbits are not cash-rich  you know). From what I can tell this Panera is pretty standard. Enticing menu, maze-like seating area and fairly quick service.  While the employees here are really just super cheery, no amount of happiness hides the fact that at lunch time this place is mobbed. I have more than once been relegated to the bar that is actually IN the ordering line to eat my leafy delight.  Still, if you have a few extra minutes to eat it's a nice change of pace from so many fried, refried & deep fried lunch options in the University area.",

So I drove to this location and they did it better than I expected! I had to order 10 lunches and pass them out during a business meeting. The manager Aaron Taal had his staff bag them individually and write the names of each order on the bags for me! This made life so easy once I got back to the office! The staff are always friendly and the exceeded my expectations! I was pleasantly surprised and will order again and again at this location!  Thanks again for your help!",

The pick two option is great because you don't have to choose between your favorite sandwich or bowl of soup. The soups are flavorful and always fresh. I would recommend the tomato soup, it's basically the best tomato soup I have ever eaten. The fresh salads are great too and so are the sandwiches and paninis. All the sandwiches are served on their fresh bread. The tuna salad is very good, even for those who are not particularly fond of tuna. Their coffee and pastries are also really good. I would suggest not going between 12 and 1 because it is incredibly busy around this time.",

I walk to get my soda and the lady tells me they have no more bagels.  I say \"that's ok, let's start over\" but her response was \"it's only a few dollars difference\" which struck me as odd as I hadn't offered any replacement suggestions yet.  I say \"let's do 2x bacon egg and cheese on croissants\".  I start to get my coffee and she tracks me down again and says \"We don't have croissant\".  I say, \"that's ok, how about ciabatta, and do you know when there will be any coffee put out on this Saturday morning\"? She takes my cup and says she will bring me some.  The coffee jugs are brought out and set up, I ask for my cup back and the she says she'll get it for me in just a second.  They bring me my sandwiches on plates, I ask if they can have them wrapped up, and if they know where my coffee cup is, and if they know where my muffin is?  I'm brought my coffee cup by the girl who took it and she tells me they set up coffee out here, I thank her for the update.  I have everything but my muffin however the same lady throughout was kind enough to ignore me for only a minute before she stopped to ask what she can get me.  Eventually I am home with my muffin, two sandwiches, coffee and soda, I take my first bite of my sandwich and the wax paper from the cheese was still in it.  This Panera is horrible and it made me sad when it ruined my breakfast.",

I also love the baguette bread you can get as a side.  Bread and butter is one of those instantly happy things for me.    I often run by here to pick up fresh bread and bagels, too.  Especially if we are expecting house guests.  It's such a nice little treat.  They also have a pretty generous rewards program for regular customers.  More often than not I get a free drink or pastry during my visit.  Stop by any Panera, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I had the chance to dine here for breakfast for the first time today, this Saturday 2/11.  I've been to Panera many times before, but always for lunch.  I do not know why, but when I think of weekend breakfast spots to try, Panera Bread is usually not on the top of my list of places to go.  However, due to the fact that my gf had a gift card we decided to give it a shot.  Service - Service was amazing, prompt, polite, friendly, etc.  I could go on for days, I'll  just sum it up by saying, the place has damn good customer service.    Food:  I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel.  It was good not great.  I'd prefer the same breakfast sandwich from a place like Bruegger's or Einstein's.  Bacon didn't have much flavor to me.  The sandwich wasn't bad by any means, it was just ok.  We also ordered a blueberry muffin and a pecan/cinnamon roll.  The Blueberry muffin was great!  The pecan/cinnamon roll on the other hand was not so great.  It did not taste fresh at all.  I feel like it may have been made a day or two ago.    Drink:  We ordered a strawberry smoothie before we left.  Both my gf and I loved it.  It had fresh strawberries and yogurt all mixed together.  It was cold, fresh and delicious.  No complaints there.     Other:  -Free WiFi -Plenty of free parking -Great salads -Great service -Clean",

One booth had a torn cushion on one side, and the cushion on the other side was repaired with duct tape. There was a lot of food debris on the carpet even early during the lunch hour.  When our food arrived, my wife's soup spoon had a piece of food stuck to it that was missed by the dishwasher. I know dishwashing equipment is not perfect, but a quick check by someone in the kitchen or by the person who delivered our food would have prevented the problem.

I think by now I've sampled everything on the menu so now I know exactly what I want and order the same thing every time. The You-Pick-Two combo offers you a choice of two of the following: soup, salad, sandwich.  I mix it up a little bit depending on my hunger and the temperature outside, but it usually involves two of the three:  cream of chicken and wild rice soup, French onion soup, Caesar salad, tomato and mozzarella salad (summertime only) and -- my favorite -- the Frontega chicken panini sandwich.  As my side, I take their super-crunchy potato chips and bring them back to work for a snack on another day.  Wash it all down with a cup of their hazelnut coffee and I've had a satisfying lunch.   This Panera has always offered great service with a smile and cooked my order very quickly.  Never a problem.",

After keying in an order for 3 people we discovered we couldn't use our $25 gift card (asked a manager who arrogantly just said \"no.\" Not \"no, I'm sorry\" just flat out \"no!\". A sign or notice of some kind at the kiosk would be appropriate right?  We also had a $5 member reward applied to our order.  So we ordered at the register after all, which then negated the $5 off coupon because it had to be online or at said kiosk.  No big deal I suppose but the manager referenced above could have honored it.  We finally get to our table in hopes that the poor service would be over, but those hopes were soon dashed when the food came out. One of the sandwiches had a nice long hair dangling from it, one of them was supposed to be toasted and the 3rd was surprisingly correct.  After sending back the 2 wrong meals, one of them was returned minus the soup.  We finally eat and as we were about to leave the same manager walks by our table.  Instead of stopping by the table and apologizing for the inconvenience he looked at me with the same arrogance as before and kept walking.    I asked another employee what the manager's name was and he said it was Aaron Taal.  Frankly this guy should be working in the kitchen as far away from customers as possible.  I'll never go back.",

It was a little crowded today, I thought the rain would force everyone to stay indoors, so there was some jockeying going on for tables (since it was also cold outside).  Had a bowl of warm broccoli cheddar soup with half a tuna sandwich on honey wheat.  Hit the spot.",

Of course my luck would have it the person at the window is getting a multiple large shopping bag size order passed through the window. When it's finally my turn, I begin to give him my order and he says that they are OUT OF BROCCOLI CHEDDAR SOUP! You know... the most popular soup... the everyday soup... the soup that probably put them on the map. OUT OF IT! I was in the drive thru around 7:30pm and they are open until 10pm, It wasn't like I was there 10 minutes before closing. Which means that the cheddar broccoli soup was low around 630/7PM... which means MAKE SOME MORE! I know you got all the ingredients in there Panera. When you see your most popular soup is low WELL BEFORE closing... MAKE SOME MORE. This to me is just poor management. I will think twice before visiting Panera again.",

Unfortunately it's the same old song evertime and my advice would be to avoid this location if you are craving one of their delicious treats. Prepare yourself to hear \"we are out\" no matter what you order (Soup, bagel, cookie ).

We have always known and been accustomed to their importance of customer satisfaction. But unfortunately we had the exact opposite experience at the University Panera bread location. The check-out staff was great, but the manager left us very upset and dissatisfied. They got my order for a breakfast sandwich completely wrong and just sent out a totally different sandwich just assuming it was ok. This location doesn't  make the Mediterranean egg white sandwich anymore. They never asked if they could me something different, they just sent something random out. Secondly, my husband's sandwich came out completely cold! The cheese was hardened and egg felt like it was in an ice bath. When we spoke to the manager, she didn't apologize for their mistakes, but simply just took it away and said she can just give us a refund. She didn't offer to remake our breakfast or offer us anything else to please us. She didn't want to deal with us. So we were provided our refund and left hungry and very disappointed.",

I got a broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl and they left a lot of bread in the bowl so there was barely any soup and the soup wasn't very good either. I do not recommend this Panera to anyone. It's hidden for a reason.",

The sandwich was great. I had half for lunch then the other for dinner. The next time I ordered that same sandwich I got half and this time I got a half of one bagel? How is the sandwich supposed to be served?",

Also they have food options and drink options as well. I ordered a Madagascar vanilla latte which was good and my wife ordered a mango smoothie with Greek yoghurt which I thought was amazing. The drinks I felt where a little pricey especially for a chain restaurant compared to local coffee shops in CLT.",

    "text": "I love Panera and this is my go-to location when I'm able to take a lunch off-campus. I've always experienced great customer service here and my food is on-point - seriously can't get enough of the Green Goddess salad.  The restaurant is well-maintained and tables are typically clean of crumbs/dishes, which is highly appreciated as I expect this particular location likely gets a high volume of traffic. My one complaint is the parking lot. There's a handful of spaces in front of the restaurant, otherwise you have to try to squeeze your car into the smaller-than-normal spaces in the back lot. I always fear for my car's life when I park it there but (knocking on wood) haven't had a real problem yet.",

Unfortunately, what did the cashier /waiter do while she took an order of Southwest salad without chicken , instead I asked for a substitute of quinoa. For which, they did not give me any substitute , and just plain salad. How sad is that!! And she spent so much time in taking my order shouting on top of her voice. I don't understand , where did she miss it ? I was hungry and after opening salad after a while, I realized now that salad is without any quinoa.  I always had good experiences at Panera , as a Panera fan. Unfortunately , today I am so disappointed with their customer service.",

    "text": "I've ordered from this Panera Bread multiple of times, online delivery, pickup and at the store itself. The service is always slow and the last time I went my boyfriend and I waited 45 minutes just to find out that our food was not ready to be served, because they did not have a receipt for us. I will clarify that the receipt did come through and the transaction of the card was processed right after we ordered to my email.   After they realized we had been waiting, a worker rudely asked for the name of the person who paid  (my boyfriend) and still could not find our order. I showed him the receipt on my phone and he took my phone to the kitchen to make the order. With that said, he then proceeded to come back and tell me there was a different name on the receipt. It was under my name, but he didn't ask for the account name. The worker had asked for the cardholder's name. He came back and made it sound like it was our fault that our order was not ready.   This would not be a big deal if the level of professionalism was missing. If you miss an order, you should politely apologize for the wait and try to work with the customer. Also, I don't know of any restaurant taking a customer's phone to the back of the kitchen.   *Update* We ended up leaving and asking for a refund. Turns out there were already 4 other people waiting for refunds in front of us. Please do not go here for Panera Bread. I have been a long time customer of Panera Bread, but will never be returning to this one.",

I mean I just don't get it, they offer customizations, but does anyone read them, it doesn't matter how simple the change is, so now once again I'm waiting for them to redeliver my order. Spoke to the manager Jonathan, who's excuse was they were busy, ummm why is that my problem. You still have an obligation to produce accurate orders. Now back to the food. This stores food freshness is lacking, they are hit or miss with wilted lettuce and bad avocados. Once my avocado was so bad it was black, like they had to see that while preparing it, would they want to eat that, would they feed that to their family? For as much as we spend on this supposedly fresh food with quality ingredients, they need to get it together!",

After we drove off, we realized that all of our sides were missing.  Then we got home and our food was so sloppily put together that we had to re-assemble it. The food quality was very poor-surprisingly for a Panera restaurant.  There wasn't one thing that anyone said was good.  We threw out 2 items. I contacted Panera about it and they said they'd look into it.  I haven't heard back so we will stay away from that one.",

It was the first order I placed online so I had no idea that it didn't go through. Being ill, my mother went to pick up the food and was asking for my name. They said they didn't have that order.  My mother replace the order and they ended up forgetting a soup off of the order... To make a long story short, they told us that they would take care of us the next time we came in and that's exactly what they did. The online order not going through wasn't their fault, but they still acknowledged that it was a problem and took great care of us. Tony & Maria made us delicious meals ad th manager Sydney gets an A+!",
