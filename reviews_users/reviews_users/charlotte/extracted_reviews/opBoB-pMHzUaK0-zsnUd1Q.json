The food is served on styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. But, it was delicious!  My only complaint is that for some reason they only allow one refill on fountain sodas. I don't understand this because fountain soda costs restaurants next to nothing. You are basically paying for the cup. So why not allow more than one refill?  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was just coming from the post office thinking I need to stop for lunch and figured I'd end up at Subway then I looked to my right and saw this place.  I remember a review in the Charlotte Observer and thought I'd give it a try.  So I put the car in reverse and pulled in the parking lot.  I think the place used to be an ice cream joint and it is small.  On the inside there are about 10 retro-style tables.  On the walls are old records and 50's and 60's memorabilia.  They have a small covered patio outside with ceiling fans and then picnic tables with umbrellas out in the sun in front of the patio.  The menu is on the wall written on a chalkboard.  It has breakfast and lunch items.  The breakfast looks interesting and I'll have to try that sometime.  For lunch, the menu consists of quick lunch fare - burgers, sandwiches, maybe a salad in there.  Nothing fancy.  There are daily specials for both breakfast and lunch.  I was greeted instantly as I walked in the door.  There were about 5 women working the front of the restaurant.  The order taker was very helpful in suggesting a special.  So I went with Jimmy's Special which was 2 burgers with cheese, onion rings on top, with a special sauce and fries.  Drink was $1.    It came out about 10 minutes later.  It was big.  The first thing I tasted was yellow mustard.  Was this part of the special sauce?  I wasn't complaining.  I love yellow mustard especially on a burger so I was quite happy even if I couldn't figure out the special sauce.  Anyway, the burger was good.  It was big and came with crinkle cut fries.   Nothing fancy on the food but sometimes that's all I need.  Simple can be great as well as long as it's cooked well.  And the service itself gets 6 stars from me.  The women were constantly asking if everything was ok or if I needed a refill on my drink.  Just beware if you go...if it's busy and it's too hot outside, there will be people hawking over your table just ready to pounce the instance you stand up to leave.",

The employees at the front counter where you order are always very nice and helpful when you just can't decide on what to order.  The restaurant is really clean and has a very kitschy, retro vibe to it.  You place your order when you walk in and then find a place to sit.  It's a kind of small restaurant so I suggest you get there early if you are going during the lunch rush!  The employees are always walking around making sure you have everything you need and making sure your drink is always topped off!  One of my favorite sandwiches there is the fish sandwich.  The fish is fried, but not too heavy.  It's very tender and flakey and served on a big bun.  They also put Cole slaw on it which I think is fantastic!  It's super yummy!  Their fries are always my choice side because they're awesome!  They are the crinkle cut style and they are always hot and fresh!  I've also tried their burgers and gyro and both are also good!  Give The Dive N a shot, you won't be disappointed!!",

They only serve breakfast and lunch and they have daily specials for each.  The theme is that of a 50's style diner.  With some reservations I decided to try to the BBQ plate.  Once I ordered I thought for sure I had made a mistake because I know what good Q tastes like and I just ordered it from a 50's style diner.  That's usually a big no no!  As you can see from the pic of the plate it's a nice portion of food.  I was acutally impressed by the pulled BBQ!  It was very tasty and I was a fan of the vinegar based sauce that accompanied it.  The slaw was great, finely chopped just the way I like it.  Also the drinks they serve come with that really crushed ice which is a favorite of mine.  I don't know why more restaurants don't have that?!?!  The BBQ plate was $7.25 plus $1.25 for the drink.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant area was very clean which is always a plus.  I will definitely be back here again to try some of their other menu items, but for first impressions I give them 4 stars!",

Sandwich was delicious... fries were decent, but a little undercooked for my liking. Inside is 50's style decor, and the staff is very friendly.

I loved the decor of the place... A cool, retro vibe with 50's style diner interior and even some of that aluminum siding stuff on the side of the counter... I found some snazzy murals on the wall of Elvis and Marilyn and they have some funny little caricatures of the staff as well...   Outside, they have a covered patio area and an additional area with picnic tables and umbrellas instead of an actual cover... It'd be perfect for a nice day with no wind...   If you're addicted to condiments, you should know they have their sauce game on lock...  Most places charge for additional condiments now, but at the Dive N, you are charged for additional condiments or sauces that don't \"come with\" your meal... So if you like a weird combination, you might have to pay a little extra... It's .45 cents, so it's not too bad...   The service was good... Since I didn't know much about the place, the person working the front desk gave me suggestions and was very pleasant...  The food was decent... I ordered the cheeseburger with chili, cheese, slaw and mustard... Since I got it to go, I had it with light toppings and they did a great job with that... The fries were still nice and crispy by the time I got home, so that was great... It was a good lunch... I'll probably go back if I'm at the mall or something, but it didn't bowl me over or anything...",

    "text": "So I don't live in Charlotte, but my parents do... Not knowing where to get good food is why I turn to Yelp.   I was starved post run and on my way to pick up my mom from work. I checked out places that were near by me so I didn't just go with a natal chain like Panera, Chipotle, etc....  After reading a few reviews here I decided to check it out.   Walking in you order quickly at the counter, they move through the propel very quickly (as if they were the AM Dunkin Donuts counter in Boston... Sorry back to this review...)  The food selection is such that you should probably go with their specialities ... Burgers, Chicken, BBQ. I went with a Gyro (one of the reviews mentioned it).   It was a pretty warm day for December, and so I elected to sit outside on the heated patio. They quickly brought out my food. Which was very good and the fries exactly how I like them.   I definitely would return for breakfast and even lunch. I'm definitely a fan!!",

    "text": "The Dive N is a nice place in Pineville to go and get a nice, huge, greasy burger! This is a throwback diner complete with vinyl booths and old records on the wall. You order up at the counter and they bring your food out to you.   I've only had the burgers here, but that will bring me back. They are seriously humongous and a great deal for the price. The burger I got came with 2 beef patties and was topped with 2 onion rings. It also had enough cheese so that it was oozing out of the sides. This is less of a gourmet burger place and more a greasy diner style burger so expect that. It will leave you wanting a nap afterwards. The fries are crinkle cut and were slightly above average with a nice crunch. The sweet tea was average and was not sweet enough for my liking.   My favorite thing about the Dive N is the picnic tables out front. They are great to enjoy a meal on a nice day. They have no problem with bringing your food out to you after you order at the counter. It's a nice relaxing spot to have a meal. The inside is also nice. They've got a 50's diner theme and there is plenty of memorabilia from that time on the wall. There is a private parking lot so parking shouldn't be a problem. We went at around 11:00 so there wasn't much of a crowd, but as we were leaving the people started flowing in.   The Dive N is a nice greasy spoon spot with a good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good diner food. I would go to enjoy a good burger on a nice day out on the picnic tables.",

And parking was almost so impossible, I almost gave up. Tight spaces, not many of them and lots of potholes. Finally grabbed a spot as someone was leaving.   Inside was very mom and pop which I actually prefer. They have a small patio it decided to stay in due to the loud traffic. They have a wall up counter where u order and pay. Was debating a burger but ended up ordering chicken tenders with fries and a water, paid the $10 and grabbed a booth. Was pretty busy. Lots of pick up orders. Most tables were full. Staff behind the counter was pretty friendly and helpful.  Took 22 mins to get my order. And sad to say that the food was pretty disappointing. Chicken was dry and flavorless. Fries weren't my favorite. BBQ sauce and ketchup were very basic. I actually didn't want to finish the meal nor take it with me. And tenders are usually my safe food when I go to a new quickie joint.   Overall I most likely won't go back based on this experience. The food doesn't come close to making fighting the traffic worth it. And for $10 and I can much better quality food at a dozen places close by. Both the food and condiments were obviously the cheapest they could get, but priced for higher quality food.   So still on the search for a NY style diner.",

The burger itself isn't as seasoned as you'd hope, the flavor is in the cheese/sauce they place on top of the patty.   The \"crinkled\" fries are a bit underwhelming, not much flavor, zero seasoning, but I guess that's what you'd except from an classic burger shop. You can combat that with their homemade ranch (guessing based on its style. Not the cheap dressing, but a decent dip for the fries.)  It's a themed diner which I can appreciate. Overall I'd say give it a go.",

One of those tucked away places that you happen across that has a great menu where everything we ordered was awesome- even the pickiest eater in our party devoured her food. (Our 6 year old grilled cheese connoisseur) the chicken fingers were flavorful and crisp on the outside. My sloppy joes had a heat to them and my husband loves the philly. This may be a new favorite.   The food was great and the service was good too. They kept circulating asking if we needed anything. Not bad for counter service.",

So often now, people will make cheap food, outdated decor and call it an authentic diner. No. A True diner has people who love good food and want you to love it, too. They're not into giving you an experience or taking you on a culinary journey. They want you to roll your eyes in back of your head, moan orgasmically and leave them a $3 tip on your $6 lunch. The $88 pp place with have you telling your friends about the shaved clam amuse bouchee. The diner will have you telling your friends that they HAVE to go there right how and try the ______ because it's to die for.   You have to go there right now. It's to die for.",

    "text": "I have never been to this restaurant before, but a couple of my co-workers and I decided to take our lunch break here. There is plenty of parking (especially since there is an empty lot next to the building). Inside there is a little hallway before you place your order. There are not that many tables inside but there are plenty of tables on the patio! We were lucky because she was cleaning a table right when we walked in (the last one available). I had a few questions about the menu since I have never been here before and the lady helping us was very informative and patient. I ended up ordering a turkey burger with the fried pickles as my side.  We sat down and gabbed for a little, and it was not that long until our food came out (probably 10 - 15 minutes, but they were pretty slammed). The turkey burger was pretty good! Flavorful. It does not come with toppings, but you can add whatever you like to it! The burger was definitely filling, and I was not able to even finish my fried pickles! The pickles were thinly sliced and lightly battered (the perfect combo, if you ask me). They were delicious! I could probably just eat a basket of them and be completely happy with my lunch.  The environment was welcoming and the staff is definitely friendly. You do not have a \"server\" here, but we were checked on a couple of times to see if we needed refills and to clean our baskets. It does have the \"diner\" nostalgia that draws in back to my childhood. The retro silver booths, and the Marilyn Monroe mural, and The Andy Griffith Show sign.  I will DEFINITELY be back in for lunch soon!",

I got the bbq sandwich with a side of potato salad. Usually I'm not a fan of vinegar based bbq sauces and elect to go with the thicker ones. For some reason there sandwich goes perfect with it. I've also had the sloppy joe which was great as well. Wish they were open passed 3 but if my only complaint is wanting them to be more available than I'd say they are doing good for themselves.",

The food came out rather fast for being cooked when ordered. The burger was flat topped cooked (at least it seemed like it) and it was good!! The fries were a little too done for me, but I'm pretty picky about my fries. The vibe of the diner was nice and exactly what I expected. Everyone that worked there was so polite and friendly.

If you are driving fast you will miss it, so be in the right lane so you can make the turn.  A diner, so burgers, fries and fried foods.  A good selection on the menu and prices are reasonable.  My 98 yr old dad likes it as he can order a fried egg sandwich.  The people who work there are very flexible to substitutions or special requests.  Just remember that it is a grill and deep fry kitchen.  Decent burgers and lunch sandwiches and breakfasts are excellent.",

They serve the food on styrofoam plates and coffee in styrofoam cups.. which is ok with me. The menu has a lot to pick from. You order at the counter and the food is taken to your table by a counter person. I ordered an egg, ham and cheese sandwich on rye toast. It was delicious and filling. The coffee is good. My Dad got scrambled eggs, bacon and toast and my Sister got a scrambled egg. Everything came to a little over $17.00, that is including the tip. I liked the place and would definitely go there again. Before I leave NC I want to go to try the burger and fries. Excellent experience. The staff are nice and friendly.",

On each visit, I was greeted warmly immediately upon my entry and offered attentive, friendly service throughout my meal. The atmosphere is uniquely nostalgic, which is one of my favorite things here.   You order at the counter and find a seat (a window booth if you're lucky.) Food is made to order and quickly arrives piping hot. I went sinple with a cheeseburger and fries for $5.20. Both were tasty. Burgers are like the old grill style, if you're old enough to remember.  I like breakfast here a bit more than lunch. You can't beat $5.99 for two eggs, country ham (with extra cholesterol and high bp), grits,  fluffy biscuit and coffee (eagerly refilled). One small shortcoming, however, is that butter and raw sugar are not available. I can handle the white granular sugar but, for me, margarine just doesn't cut it.   Sanitation score was an impressive 97 and has always been in high 90s each visit. Outside seating is also available.  Would definitely eat here again (and hope to.) I highly recommend this hidden jewel in Pineville!",

Portions are just right, flavor is on spot, fair prices, and ambience is relaxing.  Love the decoration.  Had 2 scrambled eggs, with bacon & hash browns, came with biscuit, toast or grits.  I ordered a biscuit and add gravy. (delicious) Coffee for a drink.  You must order in the counter, there's only one menu available, and the only thing I did not like is that you must sweeten your coffee and/or add creamer beside the register machine.  The Dive N, is a very clean place. Which does mean a lot for me. Waitress was very friendly. They have a very nice sunny patio.  Looking forward to having lunch next time, a little bird told me they have amazing burgers.   \"They do not open for dinner or Sundays!\"  Be back soon! Totally recommend the Dive N!",

I ordered a livermush sandwhich on rye with chili, mustard, onions and slaw with a slice of tomatoe and a poached egg on top and it really hit the spot. I ordered it half-heartedly not expecting it to actually be made, but believe it or not they did it to a tee. I was very happy with it.

    "text": "This is a fantastic place to get a burger, fries and a classic cherry coke.  It reminds me of a little burger joint I used to go to back when I was a kid.  The ladies working there are always amazingly nice, despite how busy it always is.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the hours are a little peculiar.  It always seems like we want to go here when they are closed, often times we would like to go for an early dinner on Saturday's but they close at 3 pm.  Never made it here for breakfast, but they open at 7 AM so it must be dang good.  Highly recommend this little local burger place!",

Mostly because the traffic in front of here is atrocious, but we finally gave it a try, and boy am I kicking myself for not eating here sooner! It was great! As I looked at the menu, I was shocked to see how affordable all the prices were. This is the kind of place you can eat regularly on your lunch break and not bankrupt your checking accont!     I had the Chicken Chef's salad. It costed 7.25 and it was huge!! I was shocked that they put a half of a tomato on it as well as cheese, cucumber, half a boiled egg, and onions. It was piled high and deep and tasted so freah and crisp. The chicken was perfectly fried to a golden brown and cut into thin strips. It was also very tasty. The honey mustard dressing was delicious and they give you plenty!    My frriend had just an old fashioned hamburger. It was so very big and costed 4.95! You could get double patties for only 5.75! I almost wished I had gotten that instead! The bun looked so fresh, almost bakery made, I do not know. They serve crinkle cut french fries, which I prefer, and they gave her a lot of them!    They also give you a card when you order that has 10 stars on it. For every 5 dollars you spend, they card punch one star. After the card is completely punched, you get a free burger plate. I like little things like that from a rest6aurant. The staff was also super friendly and gave great service. Sadly, it is a small place and most of the seating is outside, but most is covered and ther are plenty on tables.     I know we will be going back alot! They have a large menu and I want to try so many of their specials and sandwiches! Great job Dive N!!!! I'LL BE BACK!!!!",

It goes great with their huge sized burgers. Make sure you are really hungry if you order the double burger. The best part of going to the dive n is the staff. They are so friendly. They always remember their regular customers by name. It seems like they really appreciate your business and want to make you happy. They are also very fast to refill your drinks and clear away plates. Definitely give this place a try if you are in Pineville. They have a huge menu so everyone should be able to find a dish they enjoy. They also always have daily specials.",

Real grits too, because of course, no self-respecting southerner makes instant grits.  Very clean and waitstaff are friendly and prompt. Our only complaint was that the Dive N serves everything on Styrofoam or plastic. I would pay $5-10 more just to not add Styrofoam to the environment. Also the grits could survive with a bit less butter.",

Staff is friendly and know the menu well (important for someone like me who travels and is always checking out new places for the first time). The parking lot and inside of the restaurant are pretty cramped but I can't fault them for that. If the place sucked they'd have plenty of open tables and parking spaces; the fact that it's cramped just tells you how good the food is. I'm taking away a star because if you're going to charge for a cup of water, at least give the customer a bigger drink cup!",

Service was pretty good as well. Honestly though it wasn't anything super special... I can see why they have a good regular following but the food itself isn't anything I can't make better at home. I was not thrilled with their grits and they tasted rather instant to me. They did have the little jelly packs from my 80's childhood and even had the mixed fruit one (basically apple and grape) which was always my favorite so that was a cool memory to bring back. Would I come here again? Probably not, it wasn't memorable enough.",

I had the cheeseburger club with sweet potato fries, hubby had the gyro with fries and my sister had the fried bologna sandwich with onion rings. Cheeseburger club was very nicely done (hold the tomato for me) and sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly, needed salt and a dipping sauce option would be great too.  I tasted the gyro and it was good but not something I would normally order anyway, fries were standard fare. I don't eat bologna so i didn't try it, but the onion rings were thick and battered well. Yum! Sweet tea was True to it's name, though slightly pricey in my opinion at $1.75, although you could get it refilled constantly if you liked!  Seating inside is limited but outside seating is available too.  I would definitely go back and recommend it for.sure!",
