I was more put off by the service than the food. I asked for my food Indian hot & the waiter didn't believe I could handle the spiciness & made me eat their onion chutney in front of him to see how I'd react before he'd allow me to order.  Totally obnoxious.  In the end, my food came out mild anyways & it wasn't all that great.    I gave it a try, but the rude waiter & the boring food made my decision to never return.  I'll stick to Maharani, they don't question my desire for Indian hot curry!",

I feel that some samosas have a bit of a frozen and then flash-fried taste but these tasted pretty fresh and had plenty of filling. I had channa aloo masala (a chickpea and potato dish) and my husband had chicken tikka masala.  When you go for dinner you will be asked for your spice preference on a scale of 1-10. I chose 7 and was very pleased! I love spicy food and it was perfect for me. My husband chose 10 and loved his as well. Very friendly staff and a laid back atmosphere. Definitely will return especially with the Groupon!",

The food was all quite excellent with a great aroma hitting you right as you walk through the door. Getting some recommendations from the waiter was a bit awkward but you could tell they all knew their stuff. A lentil soup with a great presentation followed by some lamb dishes. You could adjust the spicy scale of the food so we cranked it up.   Overall great food, in a location that did seem a bit odd, no reservation needed on around 7:30 on a Friday.",

    "text": "After deciding to not watch a movie on our night out from the kids, my wife and I walked down to Saffron from the theater.  I should have followed my first instincts: as we walked in the door, we asked to see a menu so we could decide if we, in fact, wanted to eat here.  The server manning the door kept insisting that we \"sit down\" while we peruse the menu.  After we did sit down, I realized I left the door to the car unlocked with valuables inside, and asked my wife to order my drink.  I walked to the theater, locked the car, and then back to the restaurant.  The drink order had still not been taken, even though there were only 3  tables (7 individuals), including us, in the whole place and 4 visible staff members.  Eventually, I ordered a medium-spicy dish and my wife a mild one.  Her dish, cauliflower and potatoes, was spicier than mine and otherwise rather tasteless.  My dish, chickpeas and potatoes, had no heat whatsoever and tasted like curry and filler.  After we ate, I asked for the drink menu.  After 10 minutes, no one had come back to take my drink order (there were SIX tables at this point), so we paid and left.  The restaurant was nicely apportioned, and very quiet when we arrived.  However, shortly thereafter a family arrived with a small child who had a penchant for screaming.  The poor manners of this family aside, the exposed ceiling of the restaurant caused the noise to redouble, and my wife and I stopped even trying to converse.",

    "text": "Saffron is a perfectly fine Indian restaurant and would have gotten 4 stars from me, but a service hiccup near the end of our meal deserves some recognition.  As many have mentioned, the lunch buffet is a good deal. They offer more selections that it appears when you first arrive in the restaurant, and for the price, you really have the chance to try some pretty good Indian food. I also ordered a couple of things off of the menu -- everything was tasty, and the staff nicely ensured that the spiciness of the food matched my preference. The restaurant itself isn't the fanciest, but it's clean, neat, and provides a fine atmosphere for lunch (which is when I would recommend going).  The hiccup for which they lost a star came (as many hiccups do) with the bill. I had purchased the Living Social deal and had informed the first server of this when he came to our table for drink orders. Part-way through our meal, however, a different server began coming to our table, and she was apparently not informed of our coupon. When she brought the bill, we reminded her, she said something snotty like, \"You're supposed to tell us when you come in, and no one ever does.\" I tried to explain that I had, but she cut me off, sighing, and walked away. The coupon was ultimately applied (it seemed like an easy fix not warranting her reaction, I might add), but I didn't appreciate being spoken to in that way and then not even allowed to explain that I wasn't at fault.  In sum, it's a good lunch buffet, but nothing wonderful. Maybe I'll just stick with Copper.",

We sampled only the vegetarian dishes and came out very disappointed. The pav bhaji was cold, so were the aloo chops which also seemed tasteless. There were three vegetable selections - Mushroom Mutter, Palak Paneer and a Cabbage based dish. The vegetable dishes seemed tasty but were not warm. It was as though the heating was switched off because there were no customers. The saving grace was the naan, which was warm and well done. I would probably come here again on a better summer day and hopefully the fare would me much more fresh and warm. For under $10 per head, I guess this was good.",

Seriously they had a tikka masala that looked like a random watery chicken curry. In fact all of their options were watery!! I'm not sure what happened as the first time I came it was a solid 3 1/2 stars now the only thing making me give it 2 stars is it was cheap and the samosas with tamarind sauce was good. The waitstaff seems really off as well. They didn't seem to want to be there that day. All in all I highly doubt I will ever come back, I came out of convenience and well totally wasn't worth it!! Watery curry and unidentifiable selections are a clear sign to stay away!!!",

It was TINY and worse than that, the paneer was definitely old. It was hard and had rubbery corners. When we passed on the feedback to our server (point to note: very politely, making it known that we just wanted it cleared because the paneer tasted stale), he actually argued back saying the paneer was fresh. That felt rather inappropriate. The goat curry looked great but was almost tasteless. No salt, no spice :-( I was disappointed in all.",

I usually find the food to be lukewarm and rubbery: that is, when I am not too disgusted by my fellow patrons' self-service habits to eat it.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy Saffron.  The food is hot and frequently refreshed, the service is attentive and polite.  Best of all, at least in my opinion, is that the diners at Saffron are usually calm and restrained enough not to be thrusting their hands into trays or re-using plates in their frenetic efforts to feed themselves.  Lunchtime is just busy enough that you know the place is good, but slow enough that it's pleasant and quiet.  I wholeheartedly recommend the chicken tikka masala and the tomato soup, both of which are delicious.  Honestly though, everything at the small-but-thoughtful buffet is good.  If you are having one of those days that require a dessert, the rice pudding is tasty as well.  So let it be known that this buffet-hater has found a buffet he can enthusiastically endorse, even to his fellow buffet-haters.",

The cost of the buffet is not cheap and the place is becoming less and less impressive.    The food is fine but the little things are becoming more apparent.  The entrees are getting to be more saucey than they were in the past (e.g. the meat and vegetables in the dishes are being reduced).  Entrees that should be thick and dense are much more watery.    More important, the buffet selections have been reduced to basic dishes that are repeated daily.  There was a time when one could find new and unique dishes nearly every day.  In short I suspect that the economy is taking it toll on this one.",

We bring any out of town guests here for a great quiet dinner and the staff are strikingly respectful. I know that's an odd thing to say and it's sad that respect stands out as so odd that it merits mention. The lights are perfect, the menu seems to have been recently updated (try the papabi chat!!)  Saffron is great for a quiet dinner, an intimate chat, a delicious lunch buffet, an affordable semi-fancy date (because the ambiance is perfect and staff is wonderful) or just about any other small group.  Saffron is bad for a large group though because they add a large tip to the bill for you. I typically tip 20+ percent but I like the option to half it for terrible service. The service has always been excellent here but I want the option. I never tip extra when insulted with an 'auto-tip.' It's also bad if you like rice because they charge for extra rice!  On spiciness - I usually get a 7 and it tastes medium spicy. But there's a big difference going to 8 and you'll remember the meal the next day. I can eat Dave's Scorpion sauce straight and and the 8+ here is on par with that. It's tasty and still edible but wow, sweat by the end of the meal. Saffron is awesome. It's on my top 5 most visited restaurants in Charlotte for sure.",

It's not very close to home for me, but it's always worth the drive to come here.  The lunch buffet is absolutely fantastic.  I don't think I've ever eaten at one that serves samosas on it, but this one does and they're great.  The chicken tikka masala, as others pointed out, totally steals the show on the buffet.  I am normally not a fan of the rice pudding, but theirs has the perfect texture and level of sweetness.  At dinner time, this place is so intimate.  Now, I think the prices are a little higher than some of the other Indian places around, but the quality is just outstanding.  I love that they also offer dinner specials, as I don't think I've ever been to an Indian place that offers more than is on the menu.  The other night, I had a lamb shank curry that was just divine.  The meat was tender and flavorful, served right on the bone.  I was also very excited to see that they have saag here.  My partner ordered the chicken saag, and he repeatedly said it was the best he'd ever eaten.  Oh, and their rice is also wonderful, although at dinner time they just don't give you quite enough.  The decor is very elegant here.  The colors on the wall complement the dark wooden tables and chairs.  The service has been top-notch every time I've gone.  Since the food tends to be spicy, the wait staff does a great job of ensuring everyone has plenty of water to drink.  I am just sad this place is not closer to where I live.",

We got the chicken manchurian to start, and then he got the chicken tikka masala and I got the chicken vindaloo with a side of garlic naan and raita. The chicken manchurian was okay but I thought it was a bit overpriced. Tikka masala was decent, but the vindaloo tasted nothing like vindaloo and it tasted like the sauce was pre-made out of a box. I was also disappointed that neither the naan nor the raita were included, but that doesn't really influence my rating here. Spice level - they definitely veer on the mild side here. I got a 5 out of 10 and thought it was a teeny bit spicy but nothing too crazy. So if you like mild, come here!  I will say that the portions are good and their Indian beers are fun to try as well. Service was also great. However, next time I'd like to try an Indian place in Charlotte that tastes a bit more homemade.",

I was a victim of this type of behavior this past Friday night. While walking towards the restaurant I noticed an employee closing down the umbrellas. I checked the current time -9:57 pm, & checked online what time they closed on Fridays- 10:30. At that moment, the employee noticed me walking towards the restaurant and immediately went inside to turn the sign on the door from 'Open' to 'Closed'. It was hurtful and disheartening watching this occur right before my eyes. I walked away, while noting that the electronic 'Open' sign was still lit and that other customers were also turned away after I was. I used to work in the service industry so I understand the necessity for closing at a proper time; however I've also worked in retail and have had employees of this place as customers and they have no problem walking into a store less than 5 minutes before closing time.  It is unfortunate that this restaurant operates on such a double standard. While I enjoy their food, I will never eat here again because of the manner in which I was rudely turned away.",

The food is just right for me. Not crazy about hot and spicy foods. My stomach is not able to handle that much heat.  We order an appetizer- the Potali Samosa. The crust is like a fried Cannoli. Really good with the dipping sauce- Mild which was sweet, Med- Green sauce and Hot-Red which I steer far away from.  Entrees consisted of Lamb Saag- Creamy spinach with lamb. Also, Lamb Vindaloo- Little tangy spice. They entrees were prepared mild and was just right.  Wash it all down with a glass of Pinot Grigio. What a nice way to end the evening. Great place to take a date on, celebrate anniversary or even a girls night out.  Will be back again.",

When we arrived we were unsure of what we wanted and they listened and offered suggestions based on what we said.   I had the saffron tiki masala and spinach stuffed naan. They allow you to determine how spicy you want it and use the complimentary lentil chips and sauce as a gauge. We completed our meal with fresh and delicious rice pudding.   I will definitely return.",

I myself an Asian and love to have indian food all the time, I checked out online and saffron indian restaurant came out, saw some reviews and decided to get some food.  Well let me describe 1st I ordered one chicken biryani, one garlic naan and  one hot and sour chicken curry with plain rice. I normally don't notice the food when im super hungry, but today I didn't get any chance to say the food was good. 1st the garlic naan was so hard and thick.probably the cook was new or food was frozen, same was the biryani(fried rice with some pices chicken), And the HoT and sour chicken curry was SWEET. I never had that sweet curry before. Nothing was fresh at all.  wondering why  people are writing something good about it, very expensive comparing their food quality.Totally worthless !!!!!",

I told him I would like to grab something off of the buffet and he said they close at 2:30. After looking over the buffet that still had plenty of food and patrons still sitting,talking,and eating, I told him I would like the buffet.  He repeats that they close at 2:30,with an attitude. I decided to leave. When I called to complain about his customer service,the manager's excuse was that some people come in and take too long so that is why he acted like that. I told her I have worked in a restaurant and if we close at 11, and someone comes in at 10:59,we seat them and wait on them just as we would anyone else because our establishment is still open until 11. You are not rude to them hoping they leave so that you can close. What makes it so bad is that it is a buffet so it is not like they had to cook the food,it was already laid out. I will not return,and will encourage my associates to do the same. Customer service was very disappointing.",

Way too cramped especially when I am rushing to eat my plate full of food! Also, the table they sat us at was terrible for buffet-ing because it was a booth and hard to get in and out. They need more veggies.  Overall it was a good experience. Recommended for the $8.95 lunch buffet!",

With that said, I would give Saffron's food a 3.5 rating. However, their dreadful service (note other reviews) brings that down to about a 2-star.   It is amazing how lousy the service could be even while the restaurant is half-full. I would stick to buffet here, considering even asking for onions/jalapenos (a common complimentary add-on from Indian restaurants) would run you an extra $2-3 dollars. Furthermore, the portions are not quite right from the entrees, so buffet is best:  Monday - Friday: $8.95 lunch buffet Saturday: $9.95 lunch buffet Sunday: $12.95 lunch buffet (includes beverage)  Ultimately, this place works if you are really craving Indian, but I have yet to find a consistently fantastic Indian spot in Charlotte.

They have a small wine selection here, but you aren't really coming for that. They also have some mixed drink specials, but I didn't partake. I had sparking water. The only downside is the restaurant was freezing cold the night I went. It was cold outside, and I never got warm inside either. I wore my coat the entire meal as did most of the patrons. I probably should have complained, but generally I don't like to. They are also very friendly with good service.",

The first few times I went to this establishment, it seemed like they never changed their buffet menu. The past two times I have gone they have switched the dishes out. As for flavor, Chicken tikka Masala is my favorite dish and their variation of it is pretty bland. That's my only real complaint other than the variety of the buffet. I have tried some of the other dishes and they were full of flavor. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is nice.",

It's located in a brand new shopping center and is really fun to walk around and spend time in.   The restaurant has nice outdoor seating, friendly service, and pretty good food. The presentation is especially nice on the dishes. It's definitely on the expensive side, but worth the price.   They have an interesting concept called a spice scale where you can tell them to make your dish anywhere from a 1-10. My little sister got a 3 (mild) I got a 6 (medium) and my mom got an 8 (spicy). The food was delicious and it was nice to have the spicy-ness adjusted!",

My boyfriend and I just got off work and was craving Indian for dinner. This place was the closest to us so we decided to try it. Must I say, when we walked in they were very welcoming and you know it's authentic when locals are in there. We sat down and was provided chips and three various types of sauce from mild to spicy, which was very good! I ordered their Indian Chai tea and I will never look at tea the same again. This creamy milky aroma flavored tea was everything! I have never felt so uplifted with tea before lol. They have a wide menu selection from vegetarian to non-vegetarian. We got an appetizer, and I apologize because I forget the name but it was great! From then we knew the entrees were going to be phenomenal. We got the non-vegetarian for two dinner deal. It had chicken and lamb, enough for two with your choice of curry for each. We got chicken curry and paneer curry, AMAZING! It was creamy with great spices and we couldn't help but to keep dipping our naan in the curry. After that, they brought out dessert which was similar to Arroz de leche, great flavor and such a calming dessert after a spicy meal. We also asked the owner what was in their tea and dessert because it had such a specific taste and aroma to it. Found out, it was cardamom which is common within Indian tea (something new I learned). Overall, their service was excellent and very attentive. They have decent prices for the portion of food you get, quit being fatties people. The decor seems elegant yet settled. The bathrooms were clean and a bonus for good toilet paper. I highly recommend and if you had a bad experience, maybe it wasn't them but you. This may be our regular to go to Indian restaurant for now on. Thank you all so much for your service!",

I ordered an appetizer and an Indian beer and as a main dish Vindaloo chicken. There wasn't much chicken but the rice was very good. I liked that you get to choose how spicy you would like to have your dish. I chose 10 (the highest/spiciest) and it was challenging and exactly what I needed.

They have a very reasonable priced, &9.95, lunch buffet so I was able to try out quite a few dishes.  Everything I tried was very good.  They had about two types of rice, about 4 vegetable dishes plus about 4 chicken dishes on the buffet along with a little bit of salad, rice pudding, and carrot pudding, oh and of course naan.  Everything was hot and very well prepared.  I really don't know much about Indian cuisine, but I like art, I know what I like.  The chicken tikka masala was my favorite with the tandori chicken a close second.  The wait staff was very friendly and since it was very slow service was excellent.  If you like Indian cuisine then put Saffron on you list to visit.  If you are not quite sure or haven't tried Indian cuisine, then go for the lunch buffet so you can sample a little of everything.",

Friendly staff, beautiful decor, and excellent food.  The lamb was tenderly cooked, unlike a lot of other restaurants I've been to where it's overcooked.  As well, the portions were ample, particularly the raita.  Where I come from (Boston), we're used to paying 2.95 for a tablespoon of raita--this was one large bowl for 2.95.  Needless to say, we went home with leftovers.  The onion bhaji were to die for--again, they compared quite favorably to those I've had in the Northeast.  Great selection on the menu and attentive waitstaff.  Highly recommended.",

Food had too much of oil floating. Two desserts which were ok.  Don't go there with too high expectations I think they need alot of effort to work with their flavors and menu.

There is certainly plenty of food and the service is very friendly. Pretty much all of the meats on the buffet as far as I can recall have been chicken, which doesn't really reflect the full array of Indian dishes.  However, this limitation is not surprising considering the lunch buffet is all you can eat and it's only $10 per person.  Would I list it as a \"great spot to brag about and bring friends to\"? No. Would I likely go there again for the buffet, due to its ability to appeal to a large group and its reasonable and predictable price? Yes.",

The server was a bit pushy with trying to sell us the V-Day special, which we were gonna have anyway. But then he was also pushy with trying to get us to order drinks from the bar, and I was just gonna have a Diet Coke. But ultimately I thought, what the hell, it's a special occasion; I'll have Bailey's on the rocks. The specials ended up being sixty dollars and the drinks brought it up to a hundred bucks! My understanding was that drinks were included in the special. Isn't the point of a holiday special that everything's cheaper so you get more bang for your buck, not expensive as shit and being upcharged for certain things that were already included in the deal? We've had meals on regular nights that were about eight times less expensive. At any rate, my husband and I do feel like we've made a mistake and we probably won't be back for a while.",

    "text": "I have eaten a lot of Indian food in my life: in India, United Kingdom, and from Maine to South Florida. I think I am good at discerning the difference in quality presented by the many Indian restaurants in the USA. Saffron gets a grade of A - outstanding. The ambiance is pleasant inside (or diners may choose outside).  Service is friendly, helpful, attentive. This evening we shared a bottle of the house Merlot ($22) and the Maharaja Dinner for two ($49.99). So, with tax and 22% tip, total bill only $94.  The Maharaja Dinner starts with papadum and spices and then a chicken appetizer that was yummy. Then for entrees,  it includes a tandori sizzler of chicken and lamb with lots of onions and peppers, basmati rice, and nan/bread. For our optional entrees we chose Baingan Bharta  (eggplant) and Rogan Josh (lamb). We ordered everything medium spicy and it was just that. Food was simply delicious. When our orders arrived we thought \"no way can we eat all this\" but it was too good to eat in moderation. So, we violated the deadly sin of GLUTTONY.  Oh well, try to eat less tomorrow (not likely, on vacation now). And, the special dinner for two includes dessert. Gotta let out my belt a notch. Bottom line is that Charlotte has a great Indian restaurant here for locals to enjoy regularly and visitors to check out while they're here.",

The garlic naan is awesome.  If you're in the area and into Indian, check it out.  Also, I love cilantro.",

I love it spicy but I think I'll go with a 7 next time. It had great flavor and just enough basmati rice. I suggest no matter what you order, get the Garlic Naan! The naan was a perfect accompaniment and a great holder for the chicken and rice.  I'll be definitely ordering again from them. Very authentic! I'm excited to try other things on the menu... but I'll always order the garlic Naan!",

BIG MISTAKE! The chicken was tough and dry.  Seemed like left over chicken they were trying to use up and not waste.  The sauce itself tasted more like soup. Truly disgusting and I threw it away after 2 mouthfuls.  If I had lived closer I would have driven back to the restaurant to ask for my money back (I probably should have but 20 mins away) I thought I should at least get on to Yelp and post a review to warn others!!!",

The is now a small park and outdoor seating to enjoy the weather and people watch.  The food tend to have wonderful flavors and textures.  I try to order something different on each busy and have not been disappointed yet.  An excellent example this past visit was our wonderful waiter, Vinay!  He was kind, pleasant, happy, and helpful.

After 5 minutes, the lady at the counter came at our table and snapped as us - \"We don't have any other tables except this one\". I mean she should have been atleast sorry for not finding another table. Not sure if she was just having a bad day but that's not how you treat a customer. Thought of telling this to her face, but we have such experiences at previous visits as well and she doesn't seem to be apologetic at all. Let her off the door, the restaurant still got a chance.",

They're a fine dining Indian restaurant & we headed here for lunch one day.  The variety of the menu is kind of sparse for me, but maybe that's because it was all Indian food. I opted for the pizza, as close to an American dish as I could get. It was actually quite good & I would have never guessed I was eating ethnic food. Some other people at the table were a little more adventurous than me & ended up getting some stuff that didn't look too appetizing to me.  The atmosphere of the place is like your normal fine dining establishment, with white table clothes & the tables already set. It was kind of dead when we got there, but we probably missed the lunch crowd.  Apparently this is a high ranking restaurant in Charlotte, & #1 in Indian cuisine. I wish I could appreciate the food more, but I'd just rather stick to my American entrees.",

    "text": "We found this place while looking for another restaurant and thought it would be great to give it a try. It was during the lunch buffet and since I'm a vegetarian,  I thought to myself that you can never go wrong with Indian food. Since we've been to 2 others in the area (Spice South Indian Cuisine which is now Peacock Indian Cuisine and still amazing, and the other place being Jaipur) we thought this place would be a nice spur of the moment change.  First off the vegetarian options were very slim with only about 4 options versus the many chicken dishes. I got some of the vegetable biryani and naan and my husband got the other vegetarian dishes that I didn't get. I took one bite of the naan and the biryani and was instantly done! The flavor was non-existent and the rice was dry. I tasted the dishes that my husband got and they tasted like baby food and like they had come from a can and cooked in the microwave. I am not Indian, nor do I consider myself an expert on the subject of Indian cuisine, but, Indian food is my favorite kinds of cuisine and I've eaten and cooked enough of it to know that this was NOT good Indian food. Anytime I can cook your food better than you and I'm not \"you\" there's a problem. The food was elementary at best. We spent less than 5 minutes in this place, and even though I didn't feel like I should have to pay a rusty nickel for such a rudimentary execution of a meal, I did ($25 + a $5 tip for NOTHING) simply because I was already so disappointed and just wanted the experience to be over. Anyone that knows me, knows that nothing messes up my day more than bad food. If you think this is good Indian food, you are cheating yourself because you have obvoiusly not eaten GOOD Indian food(because there is a difference). And this place should certainly not be called \"Fine\" anything. I'm only giving it one star because I can't rate it any lower.",

I really like this place because the food is really good and I really liked the way people treated me. Buffet is good with a lot of dishes but you have to try the Maharaja dinner. It is awesome, you get a lot of stuff to eat and the Malai Kabob that you get with it is so yummy. But if you are looking for south indian dishes, then this isn't the right place. Most of the dishes are North indian. And of course you get one of the most Delicious desert here, my fav. mango kulfi.",

The buffet gave me the opportunity to try some dishes that I would not have ordered by themselves. The start of the bar offers a salad with various dressings. Next comes the samosas and naan. Then there were about a dozen or so of different curries to choose from. They also had a chicken biryani.  Everything was refreshed regularly and caused me to eat way too much. Can't wait to go back when I'm in the area.",

Salmon, chicken, lamb and seared fish are served and there are also plates of seared and sauteed vegetables with delicious sauces.  Another variation are their rice plates/dishes which are mostly flavored rices with meats, shrimp or veggies.  Service is good.  Buffet stayed full. Price is right and you can get an upscale version in the evenings for dinner.  A-OK place to try a lot of good Indian and Pakistani foods.",

I remember not being particularly enthused about the food but admittedly buffets can be iffy. This time however we came for diner and as you can see by my rating everything was fabulous.  I truly love fried cauliflower in Indian spices. Though it was was not on the menu they told me they do make it and was ecstatic. Though 8t was a bit different from how I am used to having it as this had more of a sweet and tangy flavor it was still very good.  Instead of Naan as a free appetizer like most Indian restaurants they do something a bit different where they bring you hose made chips with 3 different sauces (1 red and very spicy, 1 green with a cilantro bad but also spicy and the third is sweet...tastes like tambrind but I'm not 100% sure).  For our entrees my wife got the chicken Tikka Masala and I got a goat dish. All of their dishes come with Basmati rice but I love biryani and they substituted it for me. We also got a side of Garlic Naan which was also very delicious... Especially if the sauce for the chicken Tikka Masala. I also ordered a beer (Taj Mahal) based of the description I'm being very refreshing after a spicy meal. It did not disappoint and just as Kirin is my beer staple in any Japanese restaurant, so will the The Taj Mahal be my go to beer for any Indian restaurant I visit.   The green and red sauces were so good that I asked for extra to go with my entree. I asked for medium heat but it wasn't spicy enough but the sauces sure did the trick. I'm super excited to try another Naan and another dish in the near future.",

Mutton biryani was very mushy and could have had more flavor. Samosa filling was too bland. Dhokla dried up from sitting on the counter long.  All in all average buffet for 10.95 a person",

If you're a beginner I would recommend the standard Chicken Tikka Masala (not sure if I spelled it right). You can order any dish here spicy on a scale from 1-10, Careful even a 6 can sneak up on you after a few bites. The Naan bread is a must have with every order don't forget it or you'll regret it. Garlic naan is my favorite and it's just banging! If you feel adventurous or just are looking for a good Indian restaurant Saffron is definitely one of the best.",

It's definitely a good place to hit if you're heading to Ayrsley Cinema for a movie.",

I was here for a business lunch and I am a professional cook in my other life so I \"know\" food. These guys seriously underestimate their \"American\" clientele and think whatever they will cook, we will eat...well, guess what, not with everyone..at least not with me. 1. Stale: They store food for days..I can clearly see that the food is not freshly cooked. Probably if you go here every day, you will find out same curries day by day. I think the health dept need to make a surprise visit here. 2. Service: really needs some big improvements..or shall I say, they choose who to serve and who not to. I think typically in Indian restaurants, the servers profiles you as soon as you enter into the door and they already decide what level of service they will give you. 3. Pricey: These guys are flat out costly, period. For the money they charge, you do not see the quality at all..  I hope owners of this restaurant read this and do something about it..In my opinion it is \"safe\" to avoid this one.  J.",

When I first started coming to Saffron for the lunch buffet I thought it was mediocre at best.  At that time I thought everything was bland and just not that appetizing except maybe for the naan and I probably would have given Saffron 2 stars.    I've been back recently; twice within the last few weeks to be exact and the food is sooo much better now.  I don't know what changes have been made but I can definitely tell a difference because the Tikka Masala is so much richer and fuller now and there seemed to be a much bigger lunch crowd.  I hope they keep up the great work!  The only down side is that they desperately need a fountain machine for refills instead of using 2-liter bottles.  I think it irritates them to pour too many refills or maybe my friend and I drink too much :).    My hope right now is that they keep up the great food at the buffet and don't revert back to the old receipes!",

    "text": "I go to Saffron every few months. Its pretty good Indian.   Apps: Skip the samosa and go for the pakoora or bhaji. The samosas are a bit doughy. The filling is tasty though.   Mains: Chicken Tikka = tasty and not to be confused with Chicken Tikka Masala (what most people think of when they say Chicken Tikka).  The Tikka Masala is also very good. The flavors are well balanced and I have had it both spicy and mild. Both are good and just a matter of personal tastes at the moment.  Lamb Saag is good. Who can go wrong with spinach and lamb???  Ive had the mushrooms in spinach and they are full of flavor too.  Tandoori-- ahh the mainstay of any Indain joint. Theirs is well spiced and not over cooked.   Rice and Naan: The rice is spiked with bits of spices and very fragrant. The naan is soft and crisp at the same time. Try the garlic naan.   Rice pudding: Oh yea baby. Cardamum, rice and cream/milk. Simple and deceptively good even if you thought like I did that Indian rice pudding is really runny. Then I tasted it and realized its supposed to be like that. I'll take one now and one to go. It is really easy to make at home too.   My only complaint is that naan is sold a la cart. If you tend to go through it like I do (and most of the Indian population as well) it gets a bit pricey.",

    "text": "Charlotte police investigated today when an explosion ripped through the Saffron Indian Restaurant shortly after their buffet line closed.  Several windows were blown out and Indian food was scattered over a large area in the parking lots. No one appeared to have been injured although one woman reported that her husband had suddenly disappeared and has not yet returned. She said she thought perhaps he had gone back through the line again for one MORE helping but then there was this huge \"Puff\" and everything \"turned a kind of a saffron-like color for a moment\".    Hmmmmm . . . let me try again.  Eating the lunch buffet at the Safron is like listening to one of the world's great musical masterpieces while you are slowly strolling through a magnificent museum of art. Cascading tones of taste blend with contrasting elements of sour and sweetness, textures of pan and marsala and korma waft through the canvas and melodies of chicken and peas and mushrooms and lentils and rice and potatoes, all of which are saturated in the deep rich fullness of the melted flavors of spices and gravies that bring memories and dreams of glory to life, and each new bite is more than just an elevation of spirit, it is also a preparation and initiation for the next bite. Well - you will simply HAVE to go there and enjoy new thrills of great food.

The dishes change fairly regularly from what I've been told, but everything is pretty tasty save for the samosas, which are really greasy and pretty bland. I'm horrible with the names of Indian food - but the chicken masala was great, the \"chef's special\" rice, the spinach and potatoes dish plus a few others I couldn't hope to remember the names of. The naan is good too.   For $9, this is a great lunch buffet.",

The waiters were very attentive and didn't leave my glass empty and collected dirty dishes very quickly. I am vegan, so I can only comment on such items. They only had 3 dishes that were vegan friendly, a salad with dressing and samosas. They had more dishes containing meat than they did that were vegetarian. The best item they had was the samosas.  On to the food. I love rich, spicy foods. In this regard, Saffron did not deliver. The food was mildly spiced and didn't have a lot of flavor. I'm not saying it was bad, it just was too mellow for my liking. However, on the plus side, I could tell that the vegetables were fresh, not frozen/canned. They were not mushy at all and perfectly cooked. They got the part about using fresh vegetables right - now if only they would tweak the spices to be more exciting.  I only gave it 3 stars because of the lack of vegetarian/vegan selection, under enthusiastic spices and the upper price for a lunch buffet ($10). These are fixable problems, so I might give them another try if I see future reviews say they have improved. But for now, there are better, less expensive Indian buffets around.",

My stomach did feel weird the rest of the day but it may have been because I ate 3 huge plates of food!Definitely hit the spot for my Indian food craving.    Service was nice, although a bit slow on refilling water. I will admit I probably drink way more water than normal people when I go out to eat. I also ordered a chai tea & I guess it wasn't what I was used to because it tasted really watered down.

I consider everything they cook amazingly good, but their specialty, in my opinion, is the chicken tikka masala. It's usually on the buffet and I eat entirely too much of it every time I go. It's probably contributed to at least one dress size that I'm battling.  In addition to kick-ass food, the service is impeccable. You take a single drink and someone is right there to refill your glass. Plates are whisked away quietly while you're at the buffet loading up again.  Now, as a side note, which may or may not be important to you, the decor in the restaurant is truly lovely. At lunch you notice it and appreciate the delicate artwork and calm but spicy color scheme. But in the evening, this is a great place to take a date. With the colors and soft window dressings, this restaurant is elegant and understated, without being stuffy and expensive. The food is spicier at night, so be aware of that and order lots of lassi if you can't handle a little heat.",

It was so freaking delicious!!! The staff was very sweet, everything was made with love. I have been meaning to leave a great review for this delicious restaurant. We stuffed our faces with Naan and shared my Chicken Marsala and his lamb curry dish. I rarely ever eat lamb but the lamb they had was COOKED perfectly!! Great quality meat for sure. I recommended it to my best friend and she ate there two days after we did and also said it was AMAZING!! Thank you guys so much for such a wonderful night and wonderful dishes. We will be back!",

We sat on the patio, had tikka masala, garlic naan, samosas, mango chutney, etc. Everything was excellent, including service. Two different managers, who were both very polite, came by to check on our experience. I was quite impressed at how sharply dressed the servers were dressed... Having worked in service for some time I love a restaurant where the staff takes pride in appearance, as this is typically a good sign for attention to detail in other areas of the business (read:cleanliness). Didn't really see the interior decor but through the window it seemed somewhat generic. Would definitely pay another visit.",

I am still discovering Indian cuisine and so far I really like it.   Now for those of you that are familiar with Indian cuisine I will say that this is a buffet, so if you like spicy this is not the place for you. However if you want a nice lunch with a good selection at a good price then this place is wonderful.   The lunch buffet Monday - Friday is only $8.95!   I recommend here if your a beginner with Indian cuisine, for the price and selection of the buffet, and if your an expert on Indian cuisine and you you don't mind the mildness of the buffet.",

In addition they gave much less chicken than normal they were small pieces and not a ton. The samosa was normal other than the reddish sauce was also very watered down.
