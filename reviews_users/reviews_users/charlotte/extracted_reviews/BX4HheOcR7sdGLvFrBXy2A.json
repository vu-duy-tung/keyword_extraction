Been coming here for years, the one negative is occasionally (~5% of the time) the crust gets overcooked and is too crispy for NY style. Prices are ok, not a bargain but worth the quality.

A True northern style pizza place, and yes, it has big, bigger and OMG that's huge sizes.  The smallest pizza is enough for two with leftovers, and for the True pizza aficionados we call it breakfast.  What better way to start the day, than to relive the beautiful emotions you had last night while the pizza was nice fresh and hot.  Now that spring is here, it does offer an outdoor covered patio section, and the service is always fast and friendly.  Do yourself a favor, drop the larger pizza chains, and give these guys a try. The pizzas are reasonably priced, and I can assure you that you will NOT be disappointed.  NCFoodGuy",

Doesn't need any toppings other than cheese to be perfect. The Ballantyne location is clean, open and easy with little kids. Staff is friendly.  Definitely my \"go to\" pizza place - would be even more so if they delivered, but I don't believe they do (except through a third party service, which I would be skeptical about using). My wife likes Portofino's pizza better, but she is not from NY, so her archetypal pizza likely differs from mine.",

It's another alleged NY style pizza place, and while it's not terrible, there is just no flavor to it.  The sauce needs a little spice and/or sweetness to it.  The Greek salad we had was good.  Overall, I'm glad I had a Groupon that I bought with referral credits so the pizza and salad only cost me a few bucks.  I'll probably stick to Libretto's or Lorenzo's for a while.  I will say the people at Tony's were nice and they did not skimp on the cheese.",

The slices are soggy and oily in the middle and the farther away you get from the center, the crust becomes like cardboard. They are also not fresh because they pre make cheese pizza and then just put on any topping that people ask for and then reheat it in the oven for a couple of minutes. Looks like most of the ingredients are canned and not fresh as well. Such was the case with the mushrooms and pineapple on our slices.",

Food is awful and took some time to reach a temperature that wouldn't cause burns to eat. Three clowns behind the counter were to busy on their I phones to care about customers. Counter person with the ridiculous chin hair (goatee?) Said \" I know\" when I asked him why it wasn't warm like I had asked. They were all 3 standing around to busy on facebook or something to do their jobs. I will never return and hope the owner is losing his shirt as a result of these clowns. Furthermore they are grossly overpriced and actually solicit tips while you stand waiting for them to hand you food. Terrible food and no respect for the customers business. I know they have been around a while, but I can't wait to see them close.",

The garden salad is not just iceberg lettuce with tomatoes - it also includes good stuff like cheese, black olives & banana peppers.

Tony's really does a great job.   Goodness gracious, check out my photo for the scale of a single slice. It's the size of a small planet, food with it's own zipcode, it's own weather system, and website. Massive, to say the least, and so good. You've gotta fold one of these monsters. Unless you decide to go the fork and knife route, of course. At less than $3 per, two of these guys and a cup of water is a mighty fine and cheap choice for lunch.   The greek salad and garlic knots were just fine, too. The knots could slay a vampire from behind a steel door. Garlic and garlic aroma: plentiful.   The service is fine. A little aloof at times and their methodology behind announcing when your order is ready escapes me as being close to efficient. Customers just jammed at the counter and they were trying to figure out whose order was whose. Just a cluster.   The prices are super affordable and the food is great.

I've had the Italian sub and its on crunchy toasted bread, loaded with meat and your veggies and wrapped on the plate in reynolds wrap....come in 8\" and 12\"  I've never been disappointed with anything on the menu...everything is reasonably priced and super delicious!

Pros: large slices and pies, good volume, not too thick or thin, nice cheese/sauce balance, sauce is tasty, overall tastes like a NY slice except for one thing  Cons: Rubbery crust, tough to chew. I'll admit it softened up when I reheated it in the oven but still not very good. A bit pricey for a large pie at 16 bucks but par for the area.   The pie was ready on time when I got there.",

Good news is that Tony's is a solid, good pizza place = A-OK.

The extras cost:  $2.95 for the meatballs and $.75 for extra cheese.  Did not like paying for cheese, though.  Both were good and tasty.  No complaints.  Tony's is clean and the counter people are helpful and courteous.  Given this experience I think we will be back to try the pizza.  They were sure serving a lot of them, both to eat-in and to-go.

I got a pizza with half pepperoni and sausage and half mushrooms and onions so I went back. Instead of getting a hot pizza back after they messed up, I got a pizza back immediately where they threw the missing pepperoni and sausage on it and sent it back to me...no time in the oven, just half cooked pepperoni and sausage - which is NOT safe to eat (sausage). I didn't expect a new pizza, all they had to do was add toppings, but I did expect it to be COOKED PROPERLY. It will be a very long time before I go back - if ever again. I don't expect to have to bake a pizza like this when I get home just so it's safe to eat!",

I ordered on the phone near closing time. The pizza was ready in about 20 minutes, so that was fine with me. Another important element...... they got my order correct. I split the halves of the pizza, so I love when they dont foul things up. The workers were nice and friendly at closing time, so I bet they are even better when they are not itching to go home.  As for the food....... I have to say that the pizza was pretty good. Worth a 4/5 for that alone. I will have to try a few more in the Charlotte area before I praise it too much, but it was good. The garlic knots though.............. I thought they were quite sub par. They were very tough and dough-y. These have a dipping oil type coating, which is good...... if I was using it to dip my bread in at a restaurant. I guess I am used to light textured knots with a garlic/parmesan cheese coating, not flavored oil. But hey, I liked the pizza............... and its \"Tony's Pizza\" not \"Tony's Garlic Knots\", right?!?! I'll be back.",

They have all the awesomeness to sprinkle on your pizza like garlic powder, parmesan, chili flakes, seasoning and the staff in there is super nice and they make you feel like they are truly grateful that you've patronized their establishment.  I have also had their cheesesteak and fries and the cheesesteak was so darn good that I'll pardon them on the fries that may have been in slight need of new fry oil.  If I ever have a hankering for pizza and subs, I'll bypass the pizza place in walking distance of my home and drive the few miles up the street to Tony's. The place has plenty of seating indoor and outdoor, a usable and clean bathroom and a great menu selection. They even have daily specials for cash paying customers.  Sorry credit card folks.  I'm not sure if I'll venture off the pizza and cheesesteak path but if I do, I'll surely add it to my review.  Not much else to say so stop reading and go get some pizza and a cheesesteak and then enjoy your food coma while it lasts.  That is all!",

Such an uncomfortable exchange with the Italian guy behind the counter, possibly the manager, that it continued with him starring at me with a weird expression as I walked away to the condiment area.  It felt like he was talking about me as I walked away, but of course that's an assumption.  All the other stuff made the perception seem plausible.  So awkward I didn't go back to the counter to ask for the utensils or part cheese which isn't left out for customer use.  Food was ok.  Bathroom was dirty.  Chairs were sturdy and comfortable enough.  Overall awkwardness overshadowed.",

    "text": "We just checked into our hotel in Ballantyne after an 8hr drive with our two year old so needless to say we definitely wanted to order in. I looked on yelp for pizza joints nearby and Tony's was the closest and had a nice shiny 4 star rating so we decided to order from there. I'm a self described NY style pizza junkie which makes it very hard to get my fix in the northeast Ohio area. When I checked out the menu I got excited. Real NY style pizza...a freaking 24\" pizza! We went with the 17\" and honestly it seemed bigger than that...the slices were huge. The sauce was tangy but I felt they were a little heavy handed with the cheese. Yes too much cheese can be a bad thing. The pepperoni to onion ratio was pretty spot on. Overall, the pizza was good but I wished it would have cooked just a little bit longer to get the pepperoni a little more crisp and the cheese a little browned. 10/10 would definitely order again!",

In fact, they serve up some of the area's best quasi-NY style pies and calzones in the Ballantyne area all while providing friendly service (most of the time.)  The dining area is comfortable and laid out sensibly. The sanitation score is consistently high. In short, you can count on these guys as your go-to pizza joint; however, they do struggle somewhat with consistency. Their overall package easily earns them at least 4 stars and they are among the best two pizza restaurants in the area, but they are not quite in my Gotta Try category.",

The slices were hot, and large with a thin crust.  I liked the cheese and sauce and it  reminded me of a traditional pizzeria slice I grew up with in Brooklyn.  The pizza crust was crunchy, possibly reheated slices that had been waiting a while but I am OK with that as it tasted very good and that is typical for a by-the-slice pizza joint.  Overall satisfied with the cost, speedy service and cleanliness.",

Slightly greasy cheese,  sauce not overly sweet and slightly spicy which all contributed to that good  mouth feel. The garlic knots were very good. 2 diners had the chicken parmesan, nothing special and would not reorder again as the chicken was somewhat dry and chewy edges. .The side salads were basic but  good. The place was clean and the service friendly and attentive. We ate around dinner time and the place busy with diners.  Prices were reasonable. We  would definitely return again just for the pizza.",

She ordered a few toppings which pumped the price up to just about $20 for a 14\" pizza. A bit pricey, but she really enjoyed it so it's all good.  The wait time was long. Just about 30 minutes for our order to be ready. So will be mindful to call ahead next time.",

Truly, it was such a pest that I could barely eat. Also, made me lose some appetite (as hard as that may be to believe to those that know me lol!). Maybe they should pull out some bug spray?  Still, this is a great, little (well, not so little...very spacious!) hangout for truly gigantic pizzas by the slice. Of course, they have other Italian specialties too...and I may try some of that next time. 'Til then, I hope they can get a grip on flies?",

And that's hard with a crowd full of NYers! Perfect cheese grease sauce ratio!! Highly recommend for any party. We got 3 pepperoni and 4 cheese. It was more than enough to feed a crowd of almost 40!",

You will always be greeted and feel extremely welcome. Second, the slices are huge, amazing, and very customizable! With the exception of Friday evenings, you can get any topping on your single slice. Finally, it's very reasonable and cheaper than many other pizza places!

Very oily and a bit raw. But good.   And the 17\" pizza \"the worx\" for $22.70. Two drinks each for $2,29 (Pepsi products) and the garlic knots for $1,50. Ended more than $30. For two persons is a bit pricey, but of course, we took leftovers. Maybe the pasta is better. Don't know.   Staff, actually one person. Don't know his name but for sure he's Latino, he was very friendly and fast on taking orders.  A bit pricey actually. But a classic pizza, pasta sub store. Nothing fancy. Pizza is ok.   To be honest of course it will never be a place exactly like a Brooklyn pizza. So don't expect that. I'm saying this because of all the reviews saying \"like NYC \", best pizza in town, etc...  Tony's pizza deserves a chance. That's what I did.",

One piece would have been sufficient!  Regardless, I scarfed down both slices like they were the last on the planet.  Very clean atmosphere.   Nothing is out of place here.  It is a great place for splurging on decadent pizza.  Totally delicious!   Counter service, but the pizza comes out quickly.  Because there is no table service, I was reticent to leave a tip. My guideline for tipping is that someone has to come to the table to bring me something or check on me.  That didn't happen here, but it's just the way they are set up.   It was perfect for what it was.  I would go back a million times.  Oh, the crust is on the thin side, which is exactly the way that I like it!  Tony knows what he is doing.  Two thumbs up!",

I ate half an took the other half home Im having surgery so I froze it an Ill have it while I recover :)  Their garlic knots are great perfect dough with garlic an oil an marinara yum. They have outside seating which this time of year is great when the sun shines :) If your near any of their locations stop for a slice or the Stromboli.",

The only close second is Libretto's and their location in Ballantyne leaves much to be desired on taste and service...although they do have nice outdoor seating and ambiance. When it comes down to just taste I pick Tony's. You know pizza is good when you don't want toppings, side dishes, condiments, etc. When just a plain slice of hot cheesy goodness is heaven in your mouth, and you start wishing you could eat your weight in it.  I am not sure if it's True, but when Tony's first opened one of the employee's told me their crust was so crispy and good because they use water from New York. I am not sure if this means they ship it here or have some sort of reverse osmosis time/space travel machine, but it's great. Tony's crust HAS what many \"New York Style\" pizza restaurants in the south lack...crunch. Your pizza should have so much cheese it runs of the slice, the cheese should be so salty and delicious you could eat it alone, the sauce should marry the flavor of garlic and oregano on your tongue, and if you have to fold the slice to get its entire girth in your mouth then it should snap almost in half! I grew up mostly in Massachusetts, but I come from New Yorkers and I know good pizza...Tony's is good pizza!",

I have been back in Charlotte for about a year from NYC (Brooklyn to be exact) and from my previous experiences in Charlotte a lot of the places that I stumbled suck really bad,  especially the ones around where I stay.  Anyway,  I had another spot the day before which is still amazing (that'll be another review) but since they close on Sundays and I had that desperate taste for a slice again,  I decided to try this place after reading some recent reviews.  Anyway,  I have to recommend this place as it is delicious and the slices are humongous.  Even if you were to eat one slice,  it'll get you full.  The cheese is delicious,  the texture is thick but not overpowering, and the dough although a little thin,  it was still good and it held its own perfectly when I was folding it.  Plus,  the place is clean,  the service is quick and the staff was friendly,  if you from NY and you want to get a slice that'll remind you of back home,  hit this place up because it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE.",

I'd say what I bought was worth at the most $10.00.also considering the area it is in you would think quality not quantity. neither was there.this is the type of food I would get to feed my kids and the babysitter before I went out to eat.I'm glad I ate this trash first before feeding it to my kids, never would I subject my kids to eating this over priced garbage. they need to rethink the prices and the quality of the ingredients. poppa johns and dominos flips a better pie than this place.",

The staff always has great conversation while you wait for your pizza. And the pizza is flavorful with just the right amount of sauce. Not too much. But my favorite thing about the pizza is the crust! It is a little crunchy on the outside and soft and yummy on the inside. Just like the crusty bread you get at the table of an Italian restaurant. Good stuff, Maynard!",

In addition to pizza you can also get calzones, stromboli, ravioli, lasagna, ziti, among many other different pasta dishes. I've only tried the pizza and stromboli but have been very pleased with both. The fare is slightly greasy so be careful if you're in business dress. Definitely check them out if you're in the Ballantyne area.",

    "text": "Tony's Pizza just isn't very good. I'm sorry to dissent from the positive reviews and I suppose it's possible we just happened to go on an atypically unimpressive day, but we found our visit to be a real disappointment. My husband ordered the sausage and peppers sandwich and it had absolutely nothing going for it; there wasn't even cheese (bizarre).  Just the appearance of it would be enough to send anyone who likes sausage and peppers sandwiches into a deep depression. He ended up just forgetting about it and we picked him up a different meal on the way home. We ordered the chicken strips and fries for our toddler and they gave us half the number of strips that is listed in the description and simply explained that they ran out of them yet still charged us for the full order (weird). It was frankly as if the staff was aware that the place was mediocre and had utterly given up even the pretense of customer service.  When we arrived, we were the only patrons there yet when our food was ready, it wasn't brought to our table. Someone barked and so my husband went and picked it up. It was just an oddly missed opportunity to do the obvious thing and bring the food the 20 feet between kitchen and table. I had pizza and it was fine but unremarkable. If someone wanted to pick up a pie to bring home, I wouldn't try to persuade them not to. If they wanted to eat there or order that \"sandwich\", I would offer to help them find a better lunch/dinner option.",

Recently I've tried their Italian sub and cheese steak once again.  The Italian sub is very good made as it is on the menu.  It comes on warm toasted bread with ham, salami, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and oil and vinegar.  Highly recommended!  The cheese steak on the other hand just kind of sucks!  It comes with steak, cheese, onion, mushrooms, and peppers.  The ingredients seem fresh enough but its just not that great...the flavor just isnt there and it was kind of salty.  Plus I ordered it with mayo and mustard of which it had neither.  Try Penn Station on Providence or in Rock Hill for a tasty cheese steak.  From the other reviews it looks like the pizza is pretty good so maybe I will try that next.  Two thumbs up on the Italian sub, two thumbs down on the cheese steak sub and for that it gets an A-OK of three stars for the time being!",

    "text": "Yay!  Very good NY-style, thin-crust pizza.  Yes, I know y'all are sick of hearing us yankees complain about pizza, but we take our pizza seriously.  So far, this is the best pizza I've had in the Charlotte region since moving down here 13 years ago.  I ordered a lunch special of a slice of pepperoni with a small salad and a fountain drink for $7.50.  I think this is pretty pricey for a lunch special, frankly.  I think this should have been maybe $6 tops.  Not because it's inferior or anything, but just because I don't think a lunch special should be so expensive.  That being said, theirs was a larger-than-usual slice--very generous.  A lot of places take their large pie and take more than 8 slices out of it for their lunch specials, so you get smaller pieces.  Not here.  This is a full slice from a large pie.  First, the crust is the most important.  Tony's was nice and crispy on the bottom, and doughy underneath the toppings.  I prefer a big, poufy edge crust, and this was very thin, but it was yummy.  Very good crust, with a little dusting of flour on the bottom.  Perfect for folding in half--the way pizza should be eaten.    Then, the sauce is important, too.  This sauce was just right--not too tangy, not too sweet.  Very simple and tasty.  Lots of places just don't get this right, or they use whatever marinara sauce they usually put on their pasta dishes.  There should be a difference.  This was very good.  The pepperoni and cheese were, well, pepperoni and cheese.  Not too much or too little, and very tasty.  I'm not a big fan of lots of toppings (usually just pepperoni & mushrooms for me), so I'll leave the toppings comments to those of you who pile it on.  The salad was a typical slice-and-salad kind of salad:  a little clamshell box with lots of pale iceberg lettuce and only 2 little cherry tomatoes (I like lots of tomatoes), but there were lots of black olives and some banana peppers in there, as well as fresh shredded mozzerella on top.  It's just a salad--nothing to get excited about--and I guess it's what you'd expect.  Doesn't matter cuz I'm all about the pizza anyway.  I will definitely go back when I need a pizza fix, which is unfortunately all too often for the sake of my waistline, but what can I do?  Guess I'll order a salad with it.  ;)  Yous guys enjoy your pies, ya'll.",
