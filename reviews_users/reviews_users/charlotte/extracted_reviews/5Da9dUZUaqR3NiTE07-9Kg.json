    "text": "Met up with Nikki for a lunch date here, due to her having bought a Creative Loafing Deals deal for this Coltswold spot.  I have to say, it was around noon when I arrived and there was only a handful of people there.  By one, when we headed out, it was jammin!  So, it's a good lunch crowd.  The server was really great.  She was attentive and knowledgeable.  We split a Caesar salad and a White Wolfman pizza....the salad was o.k and while the pizza was tasty, we had to dunk ours in sauces that we requested (me-ranch and marinara; her-sour cream).......I would have liked a little more something on the pizza, but not sure what.  It was fresh and served at a good temperature.  Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to heading here when in the area.",

    "text": "The one star is for the fact that once this pizza place had the best pizza and delivery in our neighborhood for years. Recently, during the last couple of years, the quality and flavor have hit rock bottom.  The crust is always over cooked and the toppings taste as though they were thrown on top from a can. I have been keeping track of this because we love to order delivery pizza.  Each time we were more disappointed than the last!  The management has lost their pride and settled to produce a product that is obviously a disappointment to the neighborhood.  They once served a great product and I hope they do again. But, until then, we will not return. Wake up!",

    "text": "I love Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger.   There. I said it. I love the mustard sauce, the crust is killer, and it's one of the few times I actually, legitimately crave pizza. There's not a Wolfman's near my house, sadly, so I have to kinda drive across town to get it, which I happily do for that sauce.   Wolfscetta as an app is okay - nothing to write home about, though the bread is tasty and it's well-flavoured, I always feel like it's a it heavier on the oil than necessary and a bit lighter on the tomato than I'd like. The balasmic that accompanies it, however, is pretty delish.   The downside is that I went in this last weekend - lazy Sunday of running some minor errands with the hubby - and was really disappointed in the service. No, not 'cos they were stoned (which I doesn't actually bother me too much), but 'cos Jesus Crap, server - when I say \"I need a minute\" to check the menu, you don't have to TIME ME.   Hovering tends also to be one of those qualities I don't relish in a server - I appreciate that you want to be attentive, but hanging out by the table is a little much, don't you think? I was cool, though - I know sometimes as a server when it's a dead restaurant, you just want to make sure you're giving the best service possible. I know we're the only table here, it's 7 hours til closing, and the skies just opened up with a monsoon - but I don't understand why, as my husband and I served up our first slices of pie, you thought that was a good time to ask if we'd want desert and choose to leave our check? Since it just began raining, did you think we might want to hang around and buy some more beer? Why didn't it occur to you that we might actually PAY YOU MORE MONEY when we can't see out of the window, due to the rain?   Even more bizarre, I went to the ladies' room for a moment, and when I came out, the manager was hovering over our table, too, just behind my husband out of eyesight. Since - again - we were the ONLY TABLE IN THE PLACE, I couldn't help but ask if they needed to close up. I certainly didn't want to be the dick table that's keeping them there! But no - no shift change, no closing, so crush of people dying for our table.   Just inept service that served to make me feel like I was unwelcome and they wanted me out of there as quickly as possible.   Which kinda sucks, 'cos I can't get delivery to my house.",

Solution: Wolfman's Take and Bake.  We're pizza fans in this house, and we take it seriously. So we don't do takeout or delivery pizza. Doesn't matter how good the pizza starts out; by the time it reaches you it's not at peak. So we love Wolfman's for this reason. The Take and Bake option works beautifully and produces very good pizza. We always get the same thing - sausage with extra sauce. Recommended for folks who like good pizza.",

The Smores desert pie is amazing though we would like to see a few other desert pies (maybe on a rotating basis?)

It was a little smaller than I expected in there, but the few tables they had were enough to accommodate the number of people, making it look \"full.\"  There wasn't a lot of atmosphere and/or decor, but it was Kids (10 and under) Eat Free Tuesday and there was a \"Balloon Artist\" there making balloon creatures for kids of all ages (don't forget to tip!).  And the two TVs were playing \"Herbie, the Love Bug.\"  The menu was pretty extensive for a pizza place, and I had a hard time narrowing down my choices because even the creative sandwiches and salads sounded good.  We ended up splitting the 12\" Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza, which gave both of us 3 good-sized pieces each.  The pizza was topped with \"secret cheeseburger sauce, ground beef, bacon, roma tomatoes, mushrooms, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.\"  The chunks of bacon really added to the flavor, as did the secret cheeseburger sauce, whatever it was.  I was impressed.",

I love having food delivered to my door, but hate having to actually speak to someone to make that happen (I blame this on living in NYC for so long and being able to order anything I wanted without having to speak to an actual person).   I placed an order for a 10\" pepperoni pizza and a side of breadsticks. The estimated delivery time was approximately an hour  and it took about the exact amount of estimated time.   The food arrived hot and smelling delicious. They do not skimp on the pepperoni! The whole pizza was covered and it was well done which made them crispy, which happens to be my favorite way to eat pepperoni pizza and it was delicious!! The breadsticks were also super tasty and I enjoyed them with dinner and then again for breakfast the next morning!   I will definitely be ordering from here again as I consider it a much better option that the chain places that deliver to my house.",

The restaurant has interesting decor, although is a bit small, which isn't a problem for us as we tend to carryout or have the food delivered. The delivery almost always occurs prior to the timeline given, and the delivery guy has always been very friendly.  Wolfman pizza really is the best in the Cotswold area, and the breadsticks with three dip options are also very good. We generally get a salad with our meal (have to throw in some greens for at least a small attempt at healthiness), and the greek salad with dressing is a solid choice. We've tried the pepperoni, extra cheese, and the veggie pizza and have not been disappointed. On top of pizza, there is an extensive menu of pasta and sandwich options, which we've yet to try as the pizza is always so good.  Only downside is that Wolfman doesn't really offer \"deals\" like some of the other chains, so can be a bit pricey. But if you're looking for good pizza and breadsticks, and don't mind paying full price, the Wolfman in Cotswold is the place to go.",

Funky has been making every sauce and dressing from scratch for ever. Their specialty pizzas are outdated, but still outrageous. If you haven't tried it you won't understand. And if you think i work there think again. I was let go after 20 years and still can't be bitter. This is simply the best pizza you can eat in charlotte. #wolfmanstillwinning #itsyourdaykathy",

That said, I prefer a thinner crust, but theirs was cooked until crunchy and was not sweet. All of the toppings tasted fresh, and the meat toppings were all cooked properly. Not oversauced, which is usually a problem at chains. A great price for a pretty great product.",

The TV's are high up on the wall and hard to watch, so that takes away from being able to sit and enjoy the game while you eat.  I might get food to go from here, but I probably won't dine in.

Our server was simply amazing - very knowledgeable about the menu and took the time to suggest her favorites. Brandi and I decided to split the large Caesar salad and try the pie of the month, the white wolf. The Caesar was good but just your typically Caesar salad - although props to Wolfman for not drowning the salad in dressing. Appreciate that! The white wolf is a simple pizza, just what I wanted, with white sauce, basil and chopped tomatoes. All in all pretty tasty but there was hardly an sauce on it which made it pretty dry. Glad we requested sauces (sour cream for me, ranch for her) to make up for it.   Looking at the menu, I'd love to try a panini (they sound delicious!) or another pizza, like the buffalo chicken. I'll definitely head back, seems like a great spot to grab a bite!",

The pizza tasted like we were eating leftovers and it was mediocre at best. We also tried the wings which tasted freezer burned and like they had been boiled and then tossed in sauce.   I really wanted to like this place because the staff was so nice but was really disappointed in the quality of the food.

    "text": "Great little lunch spot in the Cotswold shopping center!   This was another one of those places I've driven by a dozen times and just hadn't had the chance to try yet. A break in between deliveries gave me just enough time to grab a pie to go and experience The Wolfman.   They have a great lunch special between 11am - 4pm. A 10 inch pizza with up to 3 topping is only $6! I took advantage of this and got a half and half pepperoni and sausage to go. I called ahead maybe 10 minutes before I arrived and it was hot and ready for pick up as soon as I walked in. The pizza was excellent and a different style than a lot of other places around the area. The crust was softer than I expected, but it was still sturdy enough to hold its shape while you ate. (It actually reminds me of a restaurant I used to frequent that closed; brings back some good memories.) The sauce is always important as it can make or break a pizza, and these guys nailed it. Theres a little hint of sweet from the tomatoes, but there's enough spiciness to balance it out. Whatever their blend of seasonings is it just works so well. The toppings were great too. Some restaurants have greasy pepperoni but Wolfman managed to get them nice and crispy and it's the perfect thing to tie the dish together.   I got my pie to go, so I didn't interact with the employees much but the lady I spoke with at the desk and on the phone was polite and more than willing to answer my questions.   Im definitely a fan of this place. If there was a Wolfman Pizza a little closer to the university area, I'd go all the time!",

In an area where there's a lot of MYO pizzas, I feel like Wolfman is a delicious sleeper option. They aren't MYO as in you walk down the line and pick your toppings, but you can make your own concoction. However, with all their different and delicious speciality pizzas, you don't have to!   I ordered the cheeseburger pizza and my husband ordered the meat pizza, and we were both impressed with the amount of toppings that came on them. They were loaded! Also, the small pizza size was perfect for a personal pizza, even with a slice leftover for later. Wolfman also has salads, sandwiches and pasta, but it seemed like everyone in the place was ordering pizza. They also do a take out and delivery business, so you can have your Wolfman to go as well!   My only complaint (and it's super small) was that they didn't have a changing table in the bathrooms, so if you have a little one in diapers, you're changing them on the floor (yuck).",

I personally like their pizza sauce and style of crust... way better than a brix pizza spot any day.... toppings are cool wide array and variety!  Cool atmosphere!!!!! Have been going to this location for I've a decade and quality had not changed!",

We complained to the manager and she was rude and didn't care that we were unhappy with our pizza. She told us that we should have ordered extra sauce and cheese. If you want a dry pizza with dough bubbles everywhere then this is the place to go. We will NEVER be returning to this location. Next time we will go get pizza from California Pizza Kitchen or Librettos!",

The service was great and the server gave perfect suggestions. Very thin crust and lots of pepperoni. Server suggested half and half, and that the New Mexico was a favorite. It was delicious and she even put jalapenos on some of the pieces. Servers were helpful, place is small but not too busy for Sunday lunch. Great pizza spot!",

Either the recipes have changed or my tastes have changed, by the pizzas seem more greasy in recent visits. I've been going to Wolfman Pizza for over 15 years! Maybe that makes me a little nostalgic but this has always been my favorite pizza place.   Service is dependent on which kid is working as they employee lots of youngsters.",

The next week, coworker and I each ordered our own, and it was not good. I give it a solid \"meh\". Coworker describes hers as \"gross\". I managed to get some of it down, but it was not an enjoyable dish, to the point where As soon as my hunger pains dissipated, I threw the rest in the trash.  Called as a courtesy to let them know it was subpar this time, and mgmt was very defensive and \"took a tone\" right off the bat. \"I watched the kitchen make those pizzas myself..\".   I won't order there again.",

The salad was very good, spinach and goat cheese and really good tomatoes, which is hard to find this time of year.  The pizza was delish. The crust was bubbly and chewy, (my favorite) and the pizza itself was not greasy. It was flavorful and filling. I had peppers, sausage and onion. I work nearby, so will be back! Great service too!",

    "text": "Quick lunch while waiting for a prescription at the nearby Teeter. It was busy for lunchtime, but I was able to take a seat and place my order quickly. Lunch specials are either a slice and a salad or two slices, each with a soda. I chose the latter.  Special slices rotate on a day by day basis, but today was the White Wolf (veggies and fresh basil) and the New York, New York (lots of meat). I went with one of each.  Since the pizzas aren't made to order for the lunch special, it didn't take long for them to arrive at my table. The NY, NY was greasy as expected. The White Wolf was tasty and needed only a little shake of the red pepper to kick it up. Sadly, neither slice was especially hot when they arrived.  It was okay for quick, but I think I liked the Pizza Peel nearby much better.",
