How do you run out of chips?!  And she let us order guacamole knowing there was no chips. Then it took 20 mins to get our check once we asked and we had to yell at her again. We are still waiting here another ten mins later wait for her to run out cards. Worse service I've ever had!!!!!",

Tortillas are fresh made, you have the option of chips with different dips or what I like to call hang over soup... Either choice is great!... I have gotten the tacos and it is authentic, but most times I get the carne asada plate and I love it... A lot of food for the price and I am always taken care of... Would recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican food in the university area! It's a hole in the wall, which is how I like my Mexican restaurants... I hate chain restaurants... This is down home good food!",

It is in a strip mall south of I-85 near a chinese restaurant and a Family Dollar.  The decor is pretty \"Mexican restaurant kitsch\".  I noticed that there was a bar, but we sat near the door and didn't venture further into the restaurant, so I couldn't comment on the bar.  We were presented with menus by a woman who seemed nice, but obviously spoke no English.  She pointed to the drinks, and waited expectantly.  We both ordered Cokes, and they arrived quickly, along with 2 bowls of a spicy soup with sausage, beans, and vegetables.  I don't know what it was called, but it was YUMMY.    Another waitress came to take our order.  This place has an extensive menu!  Most of the items have english translations on the menu, but not all of them.  I noticed everything from your standard tacos and tortas to beef tongue, octopus, and several types of ceviche.    We both ordered the \"Tres Compadres\" platter for 14.50.  It comes with a pounded chicken breast, 2 pieces of skirt steak, and 4 grilled shrimp.  The shrimp was slightly overcooked, but seasoned well.  The chicken and skirt steak were FABULOUS.  Flavorful, tender, and juicy.  The plate also comes with a large serving of rice (also tasty) and homemade tortillas.  The entire thing was excellent.  We shared an order of flan for dessert.  It was dense, and tasted faintly of cinnamon.  My husband commented that my flan is better, and more smooth.  Theirs wasn't bad, although it had very little of the caramelized sugar sauce.  In all, we spent about $17 before tip (after the $25.00 GC), and we were thrilled.  We intend to bring my in-laws in for a yummy, casual lunch.",

Now I won't run home and tell my mama about the food, but I can say the salsas and dippings are gooooood. I honestly could have just come for this. I can't exactly remember what I ordered for a meal, but clearly it wasn't that memorable cuz I remember food. Trust!  I'm sure I'll go back... probably with my dude tho (he's got street cred... no forreal he does) at least for the salsas and chips.

It is about a 25 minute drive from our house, but we go here every chance we can. It is the most legitimate Mexican food (and we are often times the ONLY Caucasian people in the place, which is a good sign to us). We love the service (although can be \"slow\" to American standards).. you just have to ask for things.  My fiance always gets the fajitas, and I always get the pastor tacos (I tried a few others, and that is my favorite). Salsas are good, as well.

Even though the food was okay there customer service was rude the young lady that was first serving us was nice but the other ones was rude. When we left we went to our car my daughter went back In cause she left something in the bathroom. One of the waitress a older lady came up to her and told her that it was rude for us not to leave them a tip. And scolded my daughter about that it was our obligation to leave tips. I'm sorry but tips are a blessing not an entitlement and you differently you never talk down to anyone Child . My husband and I was so upset and wanted to go back in there and say something, but we are not those kind of people and two wrongs don't make a right . So we walk away... SO BEWARE OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!  No suelo escribir critica, pero pense que deberia compartir mi critica. Mi familia y yo fuimos a este restaurante para probarlos ya que somos nuevos en charlotte. Aunque la comida estaba bien el servicio de atencion al cliente era grosero la senorita que era la primera vez que nos servia era agradable, pero los otros fue grosero. Cuando nos fuimos fuimos a nuestro coche mi hija fuimos en causa ella dejo algo en el bano. Uno de la camarera una senora mayor vino a ella y le dije que era grosero para nosotros no dejarles un consejo. Y regano a mi hija acerca de que era nuestra obligacion de dejar consejos. Lo siento, pero los consejos son una bendicion no un derecho y de manera diferente que nunca hablar con nadie Nino. Mi marido y yo estabamos tan molesto y queria volver alli y decir algo, pero no somos ese tipo de personas y dos equivocados no hacen un justo.

    "text": "My favorite Mexican restaurant in the University area; if there's some place better let me know. Instead of the ubiquitous chips & dip you can get a chorizo & bean soup that is light and flavorful; it doesn't fill you up like chips will. A good choice if you are watching what your weight, although if not you can get the chips with come with a queso dip, a thinned out guacamole and salsa.  Their pork carnita's are just divine; big chunks of perfectly cooked  pork,  nicely charred on the outside and tender and flaky on the inside.  They bring you a plate with three different salsa and  pickled onions. Sometimes you get what I think is a house pickled jalapeno - it is cut in strips and much firmer than the usual canned jalapenos you get elsewhere. You get a generous serving of radishes, which go with the meat in their house made tortilla's beautifully. Never seen that anywhere in Charlotte, although it is common in LA.  If you don't want to be overloaded with carbs you can order three taco's off the menu. They come in many varieties and are dressed simply with onions and cilantro. Add some of their grilled cactus and you can fill up for about the price of any of their other entries without the excess carbs.  Most of the time the service is pretty good, everyonce in a while you may get a waitress that is kind of slack, but I can overlook that for delicious and authentic food at great prices.",

I'm a big fan of this taco shop and so are most of the Latin people living in Charlotte apparently because it is so so so busy especially on Sunday and especially on Thanksgiving. The service and response time was so painfully slow on Thanksgiving that I decided to lower my star rating to A4 even though it's really 5 quality food. I don't like to reduce based on service but this was particularly bad. Having said that I do really love the parts here and if my experience next time is better than it will go back up to 5.  And it's real Mexican food. And that's what really matters. Forget that hipster fake Mexican stuff near downtown. You know the one I mean. Just forget it.",

    "text": "Seriously ghetto outside the door with lots of guys just hanging around, but don't be deterred. The food is actually good. They bring two salsas and three little cups of various hot sauces that are all interesting and tasty. The chips are thin and warm. Husband was happy with the lunch steak fajitas. Freshly made warm corn tortillas were served with it. I asked for veggie fajitas with onion and tomato only. It came with green beans, corn, peas, peppers, onions and tomatoes. Which should have been great, but it was a little odd. Not the flavors I expect in a fajita. On the plus side, most of the veggies were clearly fresh (not canned).   There were about 6 menu options containing eggs, but I'd never heard of most of them so I didn't know if they had meat in them. Other than those possible egg dishes, there was nothing vegetarian on the menu. So that makes it a bit difficult if the server doesn't speak English well.   Despite all this, I'd probably come here again at least for the salsas.",

    "text": "The food is good.  However, the service is just down right HORRIBLE.  The staff gathers at the bar talking.  You sit there clearly out of your beverage but no one stops to refill it.  You have to ask for more chips & when the waitress brings it, she reaches over your plate & sits it down.  Not one time saying excuse me please or anything.  Then on top of that she clearly sees you do not have any salsa in which she has 2 on her serving tray but doesn't give you one nor does she ask.  After about 20 minutes after we finished our meal, we are still waiting for the check.  This has happened on several occasions.  On another occasion, I stopped by for LUNCH.  I ordered from the LUNCH Menu.  When the check came, I was charged for the Dinner item.  When I questioned the waitress, another waitress came over to explain that she had charged me for the Dinner item because my waitress did not tell her that I wanted the LUNCH item.  She said because I was given a DINNER portion, I would have to pay that amount for the Dinner.  The miscommunication was between the 2 waitresses not me.",
