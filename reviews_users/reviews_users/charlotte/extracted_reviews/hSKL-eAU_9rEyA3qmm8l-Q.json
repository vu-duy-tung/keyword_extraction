    "text": "I picked up take out for lunch on the way back to the office after an appointment today.  They are really fast with take out orders and my food was ready in under 15 minutes.  Instead of just getting an entree which I would normally do, today I splurged  and ordered a side of Spring Rolls and also a Thai Iced Tea - which is jasmine tea with cream and  sugar served over ice (so good, it tasted like dessert!).     I haven't had Pad Thai in a super long time so I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Theirs is made the traditional way - rice noodles sauteed with beansprouts, onion, egg, ground peanuts and Thai spices.  I asked for \"medium spice\" but this one was not spicy at all. (Thankfully, I keep red pepper flakes at work, so I was able to spice it up to my preference.)   The lunch entree comes with a vegetarian spring roll which is quite small but tasty.  The side order of spring rolls I got today are with chicken and a larger than the vegetarian version. Both were good though!    My total bill came to just over $11 (which is more than I normally spend on lunch) but I definitely have enough food for 2 meals, so I have yummy left-overs to look forward to tomorrow!",

    "text": "Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.  I ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!  As I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \"You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \"I want to have room for my Pad Thai\".  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.  The Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.  I'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \"dumpling\".",

Every food experience I've had here has been mediocre, It's kind of like delivery Chinese food but Thai.    Now to describe my experience today... I ordered takeout for lunch as I was in a hurry to get back to the office.  Normally I would have ordered from another Thai restaurant around the corner but they seemed to be closed. So I decided to try Thai House again as my craving was strong. I seriously want to like this place but my pad see ew was just not very good. It was over cooked, hardly any vegetables at all, and I asked for spicy and there was no heat to my dish. The lunch special comes with a spring roll, well it was more like half a spring roll haha. Which that was the least of my worries but it wasn't any good. It's supposed to have chicken, clear noodles, and mixed vegetables. It had what looked like bok choy and that was it!!    I have some friends who like this place and I've had good that was good but  nothing special here. Essentially for me, it's like fast food quality.  I don't like giving poor reviews especially when the people there seem fairly nice, if a little out of it, but I just don't think I'll be back again!!",

I can tell you in all honesty that this is the BEST thai food I have EVER had in my LIFE. I'm apparently not alone in experiencing this, because right on the wall above the register is a sign that tells you it won something ridiculous like 100 best restaurants in America. Or something like that. I don't doubt it one bit.   The outside facade is unassuming. I was blown away when I walked in by the intricate and beautiful wood carvings that cover the restaurant.   The service is impeccable, the food is to die for, I debated even writing this review because I felt like this place is a secret (MINE!) but Thai House doesn't deserve it. So, I'm yelping it from the rooftop! (Ha.) THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD I'VE EVER HAD.   Great (the best) food, fantastic service, and a gorgeous dining environment. Trifecta.  When that craving hits, get in your car and immediately go to this place. You're welcome.",

The food was average and the spicy dish I ordered was not spicy at all. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. We had good drinks and was promptly served. Our meals arrived with correct temperature and quickly. It was not a bad experience but definitely nothing to write home about. We ordered appetizer, entree and disappointed that we could not get specialty rice. I picked out the meat and left most of the veggies in sauce on my plate-refusing to take it home. Fried items seem to be better prepared. My experience with Thai food is more thinner sauc bases but my entree was thick. We've discovered some better eating(s) in the area so this place probably won't see us for a while.",

I haven't been to Thai House in a long time, and this's my 1st visit to this location, and they still manage to have the same unfriendly, slow, unacceptable level of service as they always had (the one at University area) and apparently known for... hmmm, not sure if that's a reputation you want there Thai House.  To use up a Groupon, we had dinner there last night.  Amidst it's Father's Day, it wasn't really that busy or crowded.  Somehow we still had to sit around for a LONG time before our order was taken... this was after a seemingly non-busy waiter walked by us numerous times and never even turned his head our way AND after a waitress ignored the heck out of my \"excuse me.\"    Food wise it was ok.  I had the roast duck with pineapple curry sauce while my dinner-mate ordered the Tom Kha (coconut brothy soup) and the beef Pad Krapraw.  The soup was interesting, since coconut tends to be associated with sweet food items; I personally like it, it's not heavy at all.  My roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted.  The meat was a little over-cooked, but the curry sauce was good enough to compensate.  I had half a fork full of the beef Pad Krapraw... can't tell if it was good but this is normally my fav lunch dish (except I think it works better with chicken or pork).   In all, this is an average meal (food quality wise), but the service was  unbelievably bad.  When the most impressive part of the dinner is the decor (rich & ethnic without the tackiness)... well, enuff said.",

We often eat in, but have frequently taken food home (carryout).   I will admit the pad thai here is not the best I have had. I actually only ordered it once and then decided I didn't need to do so again. However, I totally crave their Rama of Sunset dish. We have had a number of their other dishes and my husband tends to try something new each time we go. Their Panang curry is also very good but you do have to empathize MILD if you don't like spicy food...

Excellent broth, plate full of pho fixings, sriracha, hoisin sauce, the works. Perfect temperature to where I didn't burn my mouth on my first bite. Only $8.95 for a huge bowl that I couldn't even finish! I'll definitely be back.",

Before I approached the restaurant, I was reading other yelp reviews and came across a few negative reviews, claiming that the pad thai tasted like watered down ketchup. Feeling optimistic, I neglected those reviews and ordered it anyways. When the dish arrived, it was red, I thought this was very odd considering most pad thai that I've seen are brown. I gave it a try and I was really disappointed. It tasted exactly like watered down ketchup. At my table, there were 7 of us and 4 of us ordered pad thai. All 4 of us were really disappointed and left majority of our plates untouched. However, we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great. For dessert, I ordered the mango sticky rice and we all shared it.   Take away: I wouldn't order the pad thai anymore. Service was friendly, overall decent. Papaya salad was fantastic and so was the mango sticky rice.",

I often order Pad Thai from restaurants I haven't tried before because I feel like it gives a gauge of what to expect from the place. Well I placed an order to go and showed the coupon I received in a mail flyer. When my food was ready, a lesser discount was applied to my bill. I questioned why they wouldn't honor the coupon I brought in, but they said that it doesn't apply to takeout orders. This wasn't printed on the coupon (though others were marked dine-in only) and the difference was about $1.50.  I'm not sure why they didn't tell me this upfront but I let it go and took my food.   The Pad Thai itself was really disappointing. The noodles were so over-cooked that they were falling apart into tiny pieces. There was also something in the dish was that gave it a dominating burned flavor. I ate about a third of it and threw the rest away. Overall, my experience here was poor on all fronts and I won't be back.",

Thai House consistently provides me with amazing service. From their manager to their wait staff they are the most courteous and helpful people. Always nice, well mannered, and gracious.   Their food is top notch. Hands down best Thai food I've tasted. I have never had a problem with their food tasting any different no matter the time or day of arrival. Take out or dine in it's the same great food experience. I will say that the menu is a bit pricy but real talk you get a ton of food so no complaints from me there.   Overall unbeatable food and service make Thai House a must-try if you haven't already.",

The interior also has a ton of hand-carved wood decorations and siding which make it a neat place to grab lunches for work meetings and large crowds alike.   Not familiar with Thai and don't want to look like an amateur? I would recommend these simple tips:  - Thursday is egg drop soup day, which is the best IMO.  - Ask for the chili paste to add some heat to your meal.  - Order the lunch menu by number. L5 (pad thai) and L7 (red curry) are my favorites.   - you can rate the heat of your dish on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. However, in my experience these are much like the points on \"Whose Line\": made up and don't really matter. Whatever the chef is cooking is what he is going to give you. Also I'm convinced that my pasty white complexion helps to tone down the amount of heat in my order.   While I haven't tried this place for dinner, I would imagine the servings are a bit larger and cost a bit more.",

The decor is nice, but that's it. When we sat down in this almost empty restaurant, it took about ten minutes for a server to greet us, and that was only after I waved one down.  They do NOT sale any liquor, only beer, wine, & saki. I ordered the cold saki (the only cold saki on the menu) and my bf ordered a Yuengling. They were out of both...... she acted as if this were normal.  The Tom Yum soup was just okay But the knock out rolls were really good.  We split the Kai Khua and it was also just okay. I would write more about it, but there's really not anything worth mentioning.  End result: We will not be back. It was a below average Thai restaurant and they should better stock their restaurant.   GO TO \"THAI FIRST\" INSTEAD!!!",

We arrived on Saturday at 6:45 pm and were seated right away.  We started with my favorite Thai appetizer, chicken satay. The chicken was good, the peanut sauce, sadly, not so much. The flavor was a distant place from many others I have loved before. The accompanying cucumber,  red slice onions and carrots salad was good, but nothing special either. I would try something else next time for sure   I ordered red chicken curry and asked for a tad spicier and boy was it. Not \"too spicy to eat it\" spicy,  but certainly cleared my sinuses and keep the water coming spicy. I would get it again at the regular spice level. Hubby ordered Thai roasted chicken and liked it very much. He said the sauce was sweet and sour like with a kick of chili spice. It was quite a bit of chicken for the money!  We topped it off with some mango sticky rice which was good but not close to another Charlotte location that I definitely prefer. It's served on this heated stone ware bowl platter that was perfect for date night dessert. At $42.00 for an appetizer, 2 entrees and desserts,  we'll worth the money and I brought home at least a meals worth of leftover.   The waitstaff work together to take care of customers, and aside from one lady, we're all super friendly,  the last was just not personable despite my efforts to be super friendly back. Otherwise, I was very pleased with my service!   We will certainly be back to try some other items,  maybe try to come at lunch and enjoy some of the specials!",

When we pulled up we weren't sure what to expect from the outside because the shopping center was a little slow on a Friday night. Once we got in we could see the place was busy. As you walk towards the tables you are drawn to the hand carved wood decor. Not sure how they got some of these in the restaurant? The staff was very friendly and seated us quickly. We ordered steamed pot stickers and a Thai tea to start. The dipping sauce for the pot stickers was on point and the Thai tea was nice and sweet. My wife ordered veggie pad Thai with the brown sauce and extra peanuts. Can never go wrong with pad Thai. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken. I have ordered this dish at many Chinese and Thai restaurants and I have to say this was the best! The chicken was fried perfectly and they give you the perfect amount of sweat and sour sauce. Many places drown the dish in sauce and lack in vegetables. The dish had large pieces of tomato, zucchini, broccoli, peppers, snap peas and pineapple. SO GOOD! I would highly recommend to anyone. We will be coming back real soon.",

I tried the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were ok. There were a couple of over fried pieces that I had to dig out of my molars. My entree was very pleasing to my palate. I chose the Red Curry dish with Shrimp. When I first put the spoonful of sticky rice and red curry concoction in my mouth I thought steam was going to come through my ears. I then had to pull it together or I was for sure going to choke on the spicy delicious bowl of yummy goodness before me. I braced myself and went in! I recommend that you try the Red Curry dish. The shrimp was a very good addition. My total came to $22 for the entire dinner meal Portion.",

Sorry to disagree with others, but my wife and I found the food to be quite ordinary and well-below quality at other Thai restaurants we visit.   The fried spring rolls were greasy- possibly were just fried a second time to get them hot. The Mee Krob was a good appetizer except the lettuce was partially wilted and brown in spots. I usually love pad thai but what was served had soggy noodles and not a lot of taste.   Perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night I was there. Not likely to try again though.",

They know how to cook my favorite comfort food: Pad Thai and Pad See Eww perfectly. The chicken satay appetizer is juicy and I love the slaw and peanut sauce it comes with. Every dish has a beautiful palate of vegetables.  My husband loves extra spicy and if you ask for it, they will deliver it. The flavors in the curries are so wonderful and the dished are garnished with carved vegetables.  Another favorite of mine here is the Cashew Chicken, which has almost a sweet and sour sauce, balanced with crunchy cashews, sweet peppers and rice. Once again, they will give it a kick if you ask! The mango dessert is sublime, with just the right amount of sweet creaminess. I have never been disappointed.",

All the tastes were unique. Perfect of course not. We needed bigger spoons to get the sauce onto the rice. The fried tofu was a little bland. Otherwise the food was good. The service was just right. (I hate it when the new waiter at Applebees asks you 9 times mid bite how your burger is) The ambiance is more than pleasant. Thai House is a great stop on a weeknight when you want Thai food and a bit of a treat. Overall, my new go too place for Thai.",

I added a teaspoon of \"red hot sauce\" from the squeeze container and mixed it all around in my food. It did help some and took a little of the sweetness away. My husband and I ordered coffee...thinking it would be regular hot coffee with cream, instead it was Thai coffee, an iced coffee that was really good. Another first for us!  Atmosphere was very nice with the soft Thai music. It was easy to hold a conversation at the table.The portions were good size and we were stuffed when finished.  The service was really good and we will be back but next time I think I'll try something less sweet!",

    "text": "I have to say it pains me to give this place a bad rating but I honestly had to. The food here is very good and I will likely come back simply because of that but I will be ordering take out from now on. The reason for this is as follows:  The waitresses at the front of the house are great and very pleasant but the man who runs the food out of the Kitchen into the dining room is very rude and unprofessional. My wife and I ordered and the above mentioned man brought us the wrong dishes. I was not paying attention (and honestly had a hard time understanding what he said) but when he aggressively belted out what I assume was the name of the dish he delivered out loud I nodded and he set it down. It was only when I looked up at my wife's plate did I notice that he had brought another table's food to our table. Normally not a big deal but he scolded me for nodding my head earlier and said \"so why did you say it was yours if it wasn't? He then proceeded to scold the next table because they didn't recognize the dishes immediately when he brought them by either. The table tried to smooth things over by making a joke but he immediately threw that back in their face too.   It didn't stop here either, when he finally did bring us our food he set it down in front of my wife and barked out \"Is this right? Make sure because I don't want to have to come back again.\" As if that wasn't enough he then scolded another table because they asked for a dish without onions and he brought it with onions and they called him on it.   I have a suggestion for you, Thai House - keep that man in the back where he isn't around people because he has absolutely no people skills and you will continue to lose customers because of his bad attitude. Most people don't complain about things like this. They just don't come back.",

Thus, Thai House off of 51 has popped up on our radar a few times and we finally made it in this week to check out the fare. I'm happy to say, I'll likely become a regular.   Started with the \"knock out rolls.\" Standard rice paper rolls with vermicelli rice noodles, tofu, cilantro, carrots and cucumber. The hoisin peanut sauce wasn't my favorite, but was reminiscent of other Thai places I've been to. These suckers were huge, too. Much bigger than your typical rice paper roll and the wrapper was a little more al dente, which I enjoyed.   The Pho....just perfect. All of the standard fixin's and just right. Perfect for the colder air that has abounded as of late.   My wife ordered the pineapple curry. Man, this was incredible. Coconut-y, creamy, with chunks of pineapple and great pieces of pan-fried tofu. Served with white rice. The flavors were so complex that each bite had a little more creamy, coconut flavor, or chili spice, pineapple and other spices. So creative and good.   The service is stellar. So friendly and attentive. Your water cup will never be empty.   Also, an element I typically don't comment on, the decor is phenomenal. Rather intricate and intriguing.   I'm looking forward to frequenting this place for many a dinner visit to come. Lunch is next!",

My other buddy (best friend, little sister) took off to Texas, where everything is bigger, including the club I have ready to club her down for deserting me here in Charlotte :(  Ohhh Lord, I digress......  Anyway, the lunch is served with a soup which is always delicious. Very watery but rich in flavor. Full of cabbahe and tofu the day I went (it changes sometimes) The entree also comes with a spring roll which isnt of the kind that leaves an entire sip of oil in your mouth ......ughhh. We ordered 1 entree and a Pad Thai that almost went entirely into a doggy bag! It was either too much food or small apetites run in the fam? Since we shared the shrimp entree, which was chockfull of veggies like zucchini, carrots, red peppers and a scant amount of almost raw brocolli, we ended up having to get an extra small side of jasmine rice. Its so yummy and sweet and delicious!  Overall, good service, good food, good portion, and wonderful iced Jasmin tea. I likey :)",

We ordered meals to go and were quoted 20-25 minutes.  52 minutes later they brought our food out.  The worst part after a long wait was that it had no flavor.  There are much better options for good Thai in Charlotte.  I won't be going back to the Thai house.",

(Signature is a tomato based sauce which is kinda weird) the kang masaman curry with shrimp is delicious as is the Tom kha soup. Highly recommend and definitely going back.",

It is a light and creamy tomato base curry. I order it with the white rice. Going to try the hot pot next. Lots of vegetarian options as well for those who like tofu etc. If you have an allergy to nuts I would recommend reading the menu carefully and talking with the staff. The sweet tea is also not southern. It is made from jasmine tea which I found bitter.",

We think that this and another Thai restaurant further north on Hwy 521 are the best in the Charlotte area.  Thai House at Tower Place has been consistently selected regularly for recognition in the various people choice endeavors.  Newspaper reviews are posted highlighting what you will experience when you come here to eat.  Service is fast and well done.  You can make adjustments to your meals as to components and degree of spice.  Remember that Thai food is normally spicy hot.  Ask your server and they will guide you on a scale of heat that will satisfy you.  Prices are very reasonable, especially at lunch times.  The lunch menu has some quick items and a good selection so if you are rushed, you can sit, eat and get out quickly.  The decorations are interesting and pleasing.  Very Thai with lots of wood carvings and, as the restaurant is named Thai House...there is a carved wooden Thai House in a large display case.  Children will enjoy finding things in it.  Ask the waiter or look at the sign asking where are the birds, turtles, etc. in the multiple carvings.  Very relaxing for dinners and a great date place.",

I definitely recommend also getting the mango sticky rice as well. I really enjoy the warm rice and cold mango together with the coconut sauce. One thing I would do differently is ask for be coconut sauce on the side. Overall great food and service here!",

The food is ok.  I got some type of curry dish each time I've been here.  It was never really consistent, but never bad.  Sometimes the spice level was a bit off from the time before.  The mango sticky rice is my favorite item on the menu.  It is very delectable.  If you've never had it, it is a must try and definitely worth the price.

Food is always artfully prepared, fresh and hot. Service is consistently friendly and efficient. Atmosphere is elegant yet comfortable.  Regarding the food... skip the salad and start with a delicious soup, which is a must, whether you go with the savory coconut based Tom Kha or the slightly spicy Tom Yum. As far as appetizers go, you can't go wrong with any of the dumplings (but if you must choose, go with the soup!)  My favorite entree is the Namprigpaow with chicken or crispy duck. Both come in a light brown sauce with perfectly prepared veggies served with brown rice and the best spring roll in town. If you prefer noodles, the Pad See Ew is an excellent choice but, be warned, it is addictive. The pineapple fried rice is also fantastic.  For dessert, try the mango and sticky rice ('cause it's the only one they offer and it just happens to be tasty and enough for two).   Again I love this place! (Did I mention the soup?) Enjoy!",

Very creamy and filling.  2) the pineapple fries with the Chinese sausages. This is THE ONLY place that offered Chinese  sausages. Something I grew eating and it's perfect with fried rice. Of course, pork and pineapple goes well with each other!  3) there special iced Thai Coffee. Coffee, cream and sugar. I'm not sure if it's special coffee but it's close to Vietnamese coffee. Not as strong tho.   I took the one star away because of the customer service. Every time I come, it's alway something. She got the order wrong. They charge us wrong. Asked the wrong question,, I just wish they pay a little more to the details!!",

    "text": "Thai places can be swing or miss. This place was a nice surprise.  Me and some work buddies stumbled in here one Friday because we got to Mr. Tokyo too late to get a seat but we wanted Asian for lunch and only had an hour or so to be back to work.  It was very pleasant, I noticed they have a bar for dinner and weekends, the staff was very friendly and the vibe was really nice. Decorations were very easy going and gave a good Thai/Asian feel.  They gave us some complimentary chicken noodle soup while we reviewed the menu, and it was really nice on a cold day. Nothing crazy but definitely nothing to complain about.  The menu was simple and sweet with some lunch specials that were really nicely priced. My whole thing is that when you go out to a new  Thai place you have to try their Pad Thai the first time. If they cannot nail this nothing else will probably be good.  I told her she could make it as spicy as they want. It came out shortly after we finished the soup and the dish was beautiful. I wish I had taken some pictures but I couldn't wait to dive in. They had the perfect amount of ingredients on the plate( not too many bean sprouts and onion like some places) , the chicken was excellent so tasty and the sauce had just the right amount of peanut flavor.  The plate comes out assembled like it's right off the wok on a street cart like I remember from little Asia. So you get the right to stir it up how you want.  It was spicy and delicious and she even gave me a bottle of in house mad chilli sauce to add myself. I was in heaven,  stuffed and sweating when I left.  I will definitely be back soon to try more menu items and if I ever have a sitter want to drive up to Charlotte for dinner.  Thanks and good job.",

The ladies were patient and I read over the menu.  I ordered spring rolls, dumplings, and the yellow curry. Spring rolls were good but very greasy. The dumplings were served with a hair on them so I sent them back. They brought new ones and they were pretty good but salty. The yellow curry was good but not great.... maybe I needed to order it with more spice? I was not asked what spice level I wanted so maybe they just gave me not spicy. The portions were decent and I have enough to feed my husband dinner. Overall for a first experience it was alright. Total was about $30 with tip.  The hair in the food and the food only being okay means I will spend my $30 elsewhere next time.",

Their steamed spring rolls are definitely different from what you expect- not bad- just different. I've had a lot of Thai and this is a unique take for sure. Peppery, and nice.  I got a yellow curry- it's exactly what it should be- fresh, spicy, a little sweet, and tasty. Not a ton of food, but just enough. It was delightful.  At this price point it's hard to beat this place. Some places will serve you beautiful dishes with orchids on the plate etc, but this place just serves the tasty meal (without the orchid, without having to break into the kid's college fund).  Yep. Do it.",

The duck panang is my fave thing on the menu. Its a solid curry dish with tender duck  breaded and deep fried. Not my #1 duck panang but it was my first so gotta give them credit for that. It is pretty good. The house salad makes for a great cheap lunch. Its $5.50 for fresh lettuce, bean sprouts, chunks of pineapple, fried tofu, tomatoes and onions. Served with a spice/sweet/peanut/ginger dressing. YUM. Also the spring rolls are  delicious. I've eaten in and grabbed to-go numerous times over the years and service is always acceptable. When i have gone with others everyone in the party seems to enjoy their food. Overall an A-ok place to eat.",

    "text": "I stopped into Thai House for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant wasn't very busy and I was seated right away.  The decor is very interesting, carved wood everywhere with a carved log sculpture dominating the center of the restaurant.  My server came over and took my drink order.  Shortly after another server brought a bowl of chicken soup which was OK.  It took a little bit for my server to come back to take my order, but I had the chicken soup to slurp on while I waited.  I ordered the chicken pad Thai along with an order of steamed spring rolls.  The spring rolls weren't like the typical ones I've gotten in other Thai restaurants.  They had tofu instead of shrimp and the wrapper wasn't the translucent rice wrapper other places use.  The spring rolls were OK, but I wouldn't order them again.  The pad Thai came out shortly after I finished the spring rolls.  It looked good and OK tasting.  The lunch prices were very reasonable, $7.95 for the pad Thai. The service was OK, the food was OK, I guess that makes Thai House an OK place to eat.",

The only problem I have with it is that they give you a huge bowl of curry with a small scoop of rice, and when you ask for more rice, they charge you 1.50 a bowl! Either give larger portions of rice with a dinner-sized curry entree, or cut down on the portions, it's RIDICULOUS that I have to spend up to an extra 3 bucks just to have enough rice for my entree.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch today...and thought I should bring up a few things.  First of all, the food was fail-proof...always so delicious! I tried one of my faves, Pad See Ew w/ Chicken & Shrimp ($2 add-on with extra meat), which also came with complimentary soup and spring roll...just $12.90 total for all this! Of course, I had to have their Thai Iced Tea, which bumped up the bill a bit...but all quite reasonable! Still, I must say, for the $2 extra, I thought they were skimpy on the Shrimp... As you'll see in my pic, it was mostly Chicken, just a few Shrimp on the bottom. Think I'll skip on adding Shrimp next time.  As always, the service was also spot on. Fast, friendly, and seamless!  The issue that I DID have this time around was the A/C...or the lack thereof. It was a super hot-n-humid kind of day, and just as hot inside. Thanks to super-fast service, I was done within 30-35 minutes, and quickly out the door! Honestly, I couldn't have lasted another minutes inside...yep, it was that bad. A/C has never been an issue on my dinner outings in the past, so not sure if they just shut the A/C down, or had it set at over 70 during the day? Anyway, it didn't work for me...so must dock a star.  Still, like you'll see from my previous reviews, I absolutely LOVE this restaurant...so I'm bound to be back again (and again). I just hope they work on comfortably setting their A/C (to nice and cool) all throughout the day...especially on hot, doggy days during the summer!",

On a related note they were very attentive to my wife's gluten allergy which was appreciated !",

They have gotten rid of the pretty China Condiment tray. They now have a bottle of Thai Chili sauce on the table. They are fast and efficient and the food is very good. We stopped in last night before a movie so we just had appetizers. We ordered Chicken Satee' which is grilled with a great peanut sauce. We had Shrimp tempura, which also has about 6 pieces of fried vegetables and six good size shrimp. But the only negative was the Potstickers, which were not Potstickers. They were a wonton skin filled with a pureed Spinach. Not like any Potsticker I have ever had. Not the best. All their other dishes and soups and rices are delicious. Stop in and try this Thai House !",

    "text": "When I was in middle school, my best friend's mom worked with a Thai lady. Occasionally she would make large batches of chicken in a Thai sauce and I got to eat some. I loved it. Thai House took me back to that moment as the pad krapraw tastes just like her dish.   I like this restaurant. There's very intricate wood carvings, some in shapes of elephants that transport you to another place. We had a nice quiet booth and there was no wait on a Friday night. Our server may have also been a manager. He was super friendly, attentive and made us laugh a few times.   The food is authentic and flavorful. We ordered the knock out rolls with shrimp which were basically summer rolls. Loved these. It wasn't just filled with rice noodles like other places. Plenty of crunchy veggies, decent sized shrimp and of course basil. The peanut dipping sauce was the right of amount of sweetness and paired well with the rolls. I ordered the pad krapraw with brown rice and hubby got the classic pad Thai in brown sauce. We both were asked the level of spiciness. He went with a medium and I went with hot. The portion sizes are good. My meal was enough for two. Now back to that pad krapraw. It's chopped chicken which I wasn't used to, but cooked in that sauce, I was in heaven. The sauce is a bunch of things, savory, sweet, spicy with a touch of basil. I love it. I wanted more sauce to drown my rice in. While it was very good, I could have used more spice. I didn't think it was \"hot\" spicy. Now I know for next time to get \"extra hot.\" Hubby enjoyed his meal, too.   I want to come back to try some other dishes, but Thai House has been added to our date night list.",

I've ordered steamed spring rolls, golden shrimp and a soup called poh tak, followed by a vegetarian yellow curry. We'll see how good they are.  Well the shrimp were hot and flavorful. The steamed spring rolls had a lot of dough to them but not much on the inside. The dipping sauce was nice though. The poh tak was a lemongrass and chili based soup with tomatoes and seafood. It was quite good. The vegetarian yellow curry was also quite good. It was a good balance between sweet and hot with plenty of different vegetables. All in all a very good place to dine if one is looking for vegetarian food.",

    "text": "This is the best Thai that you will find in Charlotte. The cuisine is authentic, and always delightful, and the service is superb. Six days out of seven, there will be no wait when you show up, so of course reservations aren't necessary. The longest I have ever had to wait at this restaurant was ten minutes tops. To compliment the Thai theme, the restaurant is beautifully decorated, everything very tasteful and not overdone. The wood carvings along the walls are interesting to behold, and the music is soothing, but not overpowering to conversation.   The Thai House is versatile as far as occasion is concerned; it serves well for dinner dates, but equally well for business lunches. Though I would recommend business casual attire, the servers never look down at customers in jeans or casual clothes. They are always friendly, and happy to please everyone.   At lunch time, along with your entree, you are served a soup of the day which is always light and refreshing, and a fried spring roll. The sweet orange sauce that you dip this spring roll in is to die for. I could make a meal on those spring rolls alone.   Nearly every time I dine at this restaurant, I order the Sweet Jasmine Tea-- absolutely delicious. And although many people recognize Thai food for Pad Thai, PLEASE be adventurous and try some of the curry dishes. My absolute favorite is called Panang Neur (with chicken): this has coconut milk, crushed peanuts and bell peppers over rice. When you are served this dish, it will look like soup-- simply dump the white rice on your plate, and spoon out as much of the chicken, bell peppers, and curried liquid over the rice as you please. This is a SPECIAL TREAT.   Unfortunately, the above entree is extremely addicting, and you will find yourself craving Thai House curry dishes on the regular. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!   PS  As far as price range is concerned, lunch is very affordable, $10 or less. Dinner dishes range from $12-14 and up, but the food is ALWAYS worth it.",

    "text": "Stopped by for lunch today.  Except I didn't realize they don't serve lunch on the weekends.  They serve brunch.  The single sided paper menu offered ten to twelve different options to choose from, none of which I was jonesing for.  C'est la vie!  I had the pineapple curry with chicken.  It included a fried egg roll and a bowl of soup, for $8.99.  The price was right and the entree was tasty, but other two items were \"just a bit outside.\"  The soup was nothing I was familiar with, but consisted of one piece of dry chicken, a couple of pieces of carrots, and a plethora of cabbage.  It was nothing exciting.  Nor was the egg roll.  But the entree was good.  It was red curry based and had some solid flavor.  I enjoyed it a lot.   The service was good.  When I placed my order, the gentleman let me know that it was going to be a little bit spicy.  I told him that I was okay with that, but I appreciated the warning.  Drinks were filled promptly, and the check was brought in a relatively timely manner.  I might try to go back when there they are serving their full menu, to try the dish I was looking for.",

With soup, spring roll in duck sauce and an entree, I've tried the red curry with chicken and the pad thai with chicken and both made me go \"ohhhh, yum!\".  Having never had Thai before this, I am not sure how much I can really speak to the spices, authenticity, or things like that but here's the rundown:  1. Place is AUTHENTIC looking, with all the ornate wood carving it's just a cool place! 2. Waiters are very helpful and attentive 3. The tea they have is minty - yummy and refreshing 4. Every meal I had I've loved - it just takes great! 5. BOGO in Entertainment Books ROCK!  I will keep going back long after the coupons end... :)",

I often bring friends and no one has ever disliked their meal here. My favorite things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). The food is always great.   The service is even better than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. Most times I am surprised at how fast the food comes out. After going here a while they treat you like family. I would definitely recommend it to others!",

    "text": "Delicious Thai food in South Charlotte.  This place is good for lunch, dinner and take-out.  Be sure to tell them how spicy you want it - sometimes they ask your preference on a scale of one to four, or low/medium/high.  (Hint: \"medium\" packs a punch!)    The service is usually good, though a couple of times they didn't come around to my table fast enough to refill my tea.  (If I remember, I'll sometimes tell the waiter, \"Your tip is tied to my glass of tea!\")  Their spring rolls are good, and the Pad Thai is the best I've had anywhere.   Tips: - Parking is good. - Mentally drained from work?  When you leave the office, call Thai House with your take-out order and it will be ready by the time you get to the restaurant. Take-out is usually ready in 10-15 minutes, maybe 20 if they're packed.",

    "text": "I've ordered their pad thai for take out a couple of times from this place, but last night was the first night that my husband and I decided to go dine in at this place. It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The service here is HORRIBLE!!   We went there around 9pm and was the only couple there besides another group at the place. The other group left shortly after we came, but we never got service after we received our food. We never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill. They had 6 staff walking around working and doing their own thing and NOT ONE of them ever even stop to come check on us especially our waitress. When we finally got up to leave she was talking out loud from the far back asking us if everything was okay. I wanted to throw a fit and say.. \"no, everything is not okay we got no service!\"   Aside from the poor customer service; we ordered my favorite dish which was the pad thai. I asked for no onions and bean sprouts, but we still got it with LOTS of big onions and bean sprouts. My husband told me to say something about it; but I figure I would deal w/ it because I'm always iffy about what people do with my food after they take it back and have to fix it for me. It already took about 15 minutes or so for them to bring out the dish and I didn't want to have to wait another 15 minutes.   We also ordered sticky rice..and I LOVE sticky rice. It took them longer to bring us the sticky rice than the other three dishes that we ordered. The sticky rice was not moist and sticky at all. It was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long. I guess they were trying to microwave or steam it before they brought it out, but didn't do a very good job.  We also ordered the green curry dish; that dish cost $13.95 and came in such a small size plate that should have been worth $7 at the most! Big disappointment on that dish.   So base on my experience last night; I have concluded that I will NEVER go here again nor will I even bother to order take out from this place. Bangkok Ocha down the street is so much better!",

While the University location is amazing, I quickly found out that this location is anything but.  The first time I ordered lunch, I received a dish that was way too salty. I didn't save the leftovers. I ALWAYS keep my University Thai House leftovers for a second meal.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, and decided to give them a second chance.  Ordered again today- even worse than my first lunch. My chicken pad thai tasted too sweet. Another yelp'ers description of it tasting like ketchup is not far off.  The noodles were overcooked and mushy. The spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery. To top it all off, the man who gave me my food had a bad attitude. Considering I was simply waiting for my food patiently, no grumpiness was needed.  Never going here again, though the other location I will continue to go to regularly as they have delicious food and super friendly staff.",

Me and my sister when on Saturday evening to have lunch there and it was amazing. My sister order a dish and then figured that it was to spicy and she cant eat it. When our waitress came to check we told her that it was to spicy. They took her dish and made her a  new one.. Really it wasn't there fault cause my sister should have read the ingredients but it was very nice of them to do that..",

I always look forward to the Namprigpaow or Red Curry. If you do the tofu instead of meat, you get veggies like broccoli with your meal. I think the tofu is better than the other protein here.I prefer going for lunch since dinner is about the same portion and costs significantly more. Gotta try the Knock Out Rolls which are an appetizer; fresh roll, vegetables, basil leaves and tofu wrapped in rice sheets and served with plum sauce. So refreshing.",

WHAT!?). There was an abundance of rice and chicken, but I didn't think it was salty enough. Next time I guess I would try the Red curry for lunch, or the Mussaman if I'm ever here on a Friday (available for lunch only Fridays).  This is odd, but I really really like the free soup that comes with lunch.",

    "text": "Had a very disappointing experience with takeout this evening. Called placed order 20 minutes prior to arrival. Upon arrival, cashier confirmed the order and had me pay for the food. She said food would be right out. I waited 15 minutes and no food arrived. Other take out customers came, picked up three orders and left. No update in my food was given. Went to the hostess desk to inquire but no one present. Finally a harried waitress came to the desk and I asked her to please check on my food since I had been waiting. She scurried off but did not return with food nor information. Hostess finally returns and says  my food would be ready in an additional 15 minutes. Says kitchen mixed up my order. I finally asked for a refund and left.",

Nicely deep fried with crisp shell. Delicious sweet sauce to dip in.  I had the Pad Kee Mow, AKA Drunken Noodles.  Chicken was grilled nicely before added to the noodles. The vegetables weren't undercooked and the dish wasn't overloaded with veggies vs. meat. Plate presentation was nice.   My wife chose her favorite Red Curry (med heat). Perfect curry seasoning. Excellent meal. Excellent price.    We also had the 3 springs rolls as an appetizer. They were complimented well with the sweet sauce that comes with them.   If you like Thai then I strongly recommend this place.",

    "text": "We came here for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded and were quickly offered a seat and the server was already ready to take our order.  We had to ask for another minute just to look over the standard, yet mesmerizing, menu.    I ordered the Pad Krapraw with brown rice and chopped chicken.  Yes, even for me that was new.  When it came to the table, I even forgot it was chopped and thought there were too many nuts on top.  I was skeptical as I usually prefer the cutlets of chicken and thought they were pulling a fast one on me with substandard meat.  I added the brown rice with the sauce and I couldn't stop eating.  The sweet, garlic and basil flavor really came out and reminded me why Thai is my favorite of Asian food.  I tried to save some to take home for later, but I just had to take more bites.  The prices are reasonable for quality Thai food.  I've tasted much worse in NYC but dishes were less than $10.  Appears they have two other locations in the Charlotte area, so expanding from a small family business suggests that's good news.",
