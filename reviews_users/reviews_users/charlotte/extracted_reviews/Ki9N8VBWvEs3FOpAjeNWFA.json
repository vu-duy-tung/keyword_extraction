    "text": "A new chain to South Carolina that I spotted when I went to a nearby restaurant, after I saw Jeff S's review that they have yummy reubens, I had to try it out.    On a Friday at 11:30, the place was already hoppin'. If you are coming down 77 S to get here via the Carowinds exit, get in the center lane and go through the light and you'll be at Culver's front door.  The parking lot was pretty much full, but I found parking at the back and once inside they keep everyone moving and there is a ton of seating - high tops, tables, booths (both small and large) and a few tables and chairs outside.   Their drive thru was also very busy.     The menu is LARGE, but very easy to read and figure out.  (I checked it out online before I went, so I already knew what I was getting).  Place your order at the counter, get a plastic stand-up number thing for your table.  Head around the corner to get your drink, napkins and straws and head to your table and wait for your food to be delivered.  The food: Reuben:  Jeff S. was right, it was delicious.  The corned beef was tender and not stringy.  I wish the bread had been grilled a smidge longer, but it was good.  I also wish I had eaten that first - I hadn't had a reuben for a good while and I forgot that the longer they sit, the soggier they get.  Still, a delicious sandwich.  Side salad:  Typical bag salad mix with a few juicy cherry tomatoes and a thick slice of cucumber.  Salad was crisp and fresh, no brown or wilted items in it.  Served with Culver's ranch dressing, which tasted like ranch dressing, nothing wow'y.  Served with heavy duty plastic utensils so you can actually cut and stab the salad.  (thank you!) Cheese curds:  Piping hot with a thickish crust over melted cheese.  Fried and cheese are my two of favorite food groups, so of course I inhaled these.  I thought they were well-flavored and yummy. Drink:  Culver's Root Beer - YUM! Dessert:  Vanilla Concrete Mixer with Oreo.  What is a concrete mixer, you ask?  It's another delicious version of a DQ Blizzard.  Creaminess with Oreos.  YUM!  The grand total was $16 - which is kinda of high, but I had a boatload of food, including the small Concrete Mixer, which was $3.80 w/ tax.  Everything seemed to be freshly prepared, was well flavored and promptly delivered.  The entire staff was so incredibly friendly!  Varying in ages from teenagers (none of which rolled their eyes or gave a 'tude) to seniors, which I think is fantastic (the older folks of course being the MOST friendly, but everyone was very nice and seemed genuinely happy to help).  I will definitely return.",

I got the limited time Pepper Grinder Pub Burger with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and I also got a Concrete Mixer with Oreos and Reese's. Ok so the burger was awesome! The pub bread was really flavorful and the combination of the two different cheeses was great. The bacon wasn't to stiff like other places where if you take one bite you pull out the entire piece. The sauce it had on it was also very good. The Mashed Potatoes smells like they use a chicken broth or something in their gravy it was really good as well, not too salty and not too bland. The Concrete Mixer was also really good the ice cream was very soft. I just wish it didn't melt as fast haha. If you're in the area and can't decide what to eat go to Culver's, you'll be satisfied.",

It's very creamy and the texture is smooth. Probably the best soft serve ever. The deep fried cheese curds are wonderful. If you really want a fast food experience that is different check out this restaurant.",

I told the lady at the drive thru that I had never been there before and ordered a salad for work the next day, along with a root beer float for that same night. She offered me a kit kat custard dessert free of charge. You never see that at Dairy Queen, sonic, or jack in the crack.   While I have to admit to being disappointed in the float (it didn't taste as good as a&w), I still have to give 5 stars because the rest was superb! Even the next day having that salad for work lunch was incredible. It wasn't soggy or gross, it was delicious and they didn't snub me on giving too little chicken like other places do.",

    "text": "5 stars for the frozen custard.  I live in the Milwaukee area, home to many classic frozen custard stands (Gilles'; Kopp's; Leon's), but I travel to Charlotte frequently, and when I need a fix, it's nice to know Culver's is near.  Note:  It's not ice cream, it's frozen custard, and it's AWESOME in any presentation:  Sundae; shake or malt or concrete mixer; or plain in a cone or bowl.   Outside of the frozen custard, Culver's food in general is hit & miss.  Sometimes the burger patty is great, sometimes it has been squashed and seared within an inch of its life.  Sometimes the chicken tenders are juicy, sometimes overcooked and dry.  Sometimes the fish is moist and flaky; sometimes greasy.  The service is always attentive and friendly.",

I usually don't judge a place by its appearance,  trust me I have eaten in some crazy looking joints, the best was in East New York, Brooklyn,  best rotisserie chicken ever was served out of a place that looked like a dumpster with a window but anyway,  the menu had me in awe, it was quite big with anything you could imagine from shrimp to chicken to burgers, chili, salads and really good ice cream shakes.  I ordered the butter burger double with bacon, it was delicious,  fries are good and also are the onion rings.  Cheese curds are also very tasty as well, all in all a great fast food place with excellent service,  the woman at the register was very nice and explained the menu to us without trying to rush us off the line even though it was crowded.   I have been there twice now in the last week.  Burgers are fresh not frozen.  My next time I will be trying the pot roast sandwich.",

    "text": "Ok, so this is fast food...with some niceties, the ambience of McDonald's, but the customer service is definitely a cut above. Once you've ordered at the counter, you go sit down with a number, rather than standing there in the way of others trying to order. The staff is extremely friendly and they bring your food out to your table, so you can sit and talk to your friends. We love the Rueben Sandwiches on grilled buttered rye: it's not Katz, but it's close by and tasty. You get a choice of sides, one of which is Fried Cheese Curds, crispy on the outside and wonderfully melty on the inside. The Butter Burger was good, but I really don't see what the fuss is over the Midwestern beef. It tasted ordinary as far as the meat goes. The grilled butter bun was light with crispy edges. It made the sandwich. Also they are known for their frozen custard. They always have Vanilla and Chocolate, and a different flavor every day. You can pick up a custard schedule so you know what flavor they will be serving. Custard is very smooth, smoother than ice cream, but theirs is also sweeter, and the flavors are on the bland side. I tired the Strawberry Bon Bon on one visit: way too sweet and very little strawberry flavor. The next time I had Orange Cream-sickle: once again not much orange flavor, very sweet and on top of it, they mixed in Graham cracker pieces, which I really didn't like. They have mix-in you can add to the custard and they make sundaes as well.  The fried chicken at the next table looked good and people were remarking how good it was. I'm going to try that next time. It's a little more expensive than most fast food places, but KFC is higher.",

    "text": "Stopped by on our way to GA and will be coming back. Great food, clean restaurant and friendly people. And the frozen custard...?  Wow!!!    Took a bite of my husband's bacon cheeseburger and stole some fries. Next time, I might have to pass on the salad since they were so good!  My salad was good, though. Freshly grated cheese, crisp croutons and a good assortment of greens. Probably wouldn't have the mango vinaigrette again but that's due to not liking sweet salad dressings.   My son had the chicken tenders (stole some of those, too) and daughter had a grilled cheese. Both were very happy.   You can order your dessert when you order the rest of your meal but ask them to bring it out after you've eaten. Keeps it from melting. Nice idea.   This is a great alternative to typical fast-food off the highway but it's pretty pricey. Spent just under $40 for 4 of us. Worth the money, though!",

They obviously strive to achieve what nearly every other fast food joint has forgotten - SMILE and (at least) appear that you're happy we chose this restaraunt. Culver's gets it!  The food unfortunately wasn't the high spot, but we did take it home and my onion rings were cold, fries were warm. The burgers were 'ok'. I had a mushroom swiss and well, barely found a mushroom.  I'll still go back, this time to eat in and see what it tastes like HOT.",

I had a coupon for a free value pack with the purchase of another, so i got that and then 1 scoop of vanilla custard. it was $15, when she told me the price i was like ummmm did u credit me the coupon. then i realized after taking a 2nd glance at the menu the meals are all around $10. i was like zaaayyyyuuummmmmm. Which would make my mini scoop pf custard around $4. again over priced. was it good, yes. my fav part was the onion rings. will i go again, probably not. because i don't believe in spending that much on fast food for 1 person. i thought WENDYS meals were high. Culvers has them beat. my tip here is if u go use coupons, if u dont have none take your pennies to where they will stretch like i prefer to do. for $5 more i could have sat down at chillis and ate a meal with a guest for the same price with 2 for 20 lol!",

My 2nd time eating there, and I realize their menu offering is huge. Burger, fried chicken, dinner plate, soup, ice cream... I mean, what don't they serve?  I typically order swiss & mushroom burger (single, on butter bun). It's not the biggest portion. Their burger patty is very thin, which allow them to crisp the outside a little. You can also replace the butter bun with butter (and grilled) sourdough toast. Side order of fries (medium is the size they come with a regular combo) were fresh and crispy. I also tried a cup of soup (stuffed pepper soup), which was pretty good.  It's not the cheapest joint, they don't have dollar menu or anything like that. But If you are anything like me, I always find the smallest portion (thus cheapest) to order when I'm in a fast food place to feel less guilty, then you can get by with a smaller size combo (small fries & drink instead of medium) for $4ish.  4 stars because: 1. solid food 2. friendly staff",

Those butter burgers are just so tasty - and the frozen custard - reminds me of Shake Shack in NYC, really tasty when you mix in some fruit or plop a scoop in their own brand of root beer.  Speaking of the root beer, I love when restaurants make their own root beer, especially when they do a diet version.  I always hate when my options are Coke or Coke.    I try to be health conscious when I walk into this place.  If you review their website, they have a smart choice area where they give you some lower calorie options that you can put together for a sensible meal.    A lot of reviews note that its lots of butter and fat, it might be because the options can be overwhelming when you first walk in, with most options being on the heavy duty side.  Be smart, take 2 minutes before you go and review the nutritional info.    I have also seen several orders here come out wrong and so I will agree that you should double check your order if you take out to make sure everything is correct.  However, last I checked, this is a fast food joint outside of an amusement park, not Dean and Deluca.  Its a big menu, and unfortunately, when its a \"have it your way\" style establishment, orders are going to be wrong.  Besides, its the south, no one ever gets your order right...",

The beef was okay. The beef stew was on top of bread, which was mush within a minute because of all the gravy.   The employees were super friendly, but that doesn't count for much if the food is bad.

You can see from my own picture. Nice.  I also got a chocolate malt custard shake to go home for the Mrs. That was a big hit.  Okay, so I was going to go with \"A-OK\" but I think it's good.

    "text": "Stopped here for a change of pace from my usual place after getting gas in SC.  I've actually never heard of this chain before but this midwest-based chain seems to be happy expanding into South Carolina.    I would describe this place as a fast casual place.  It's not quite fast food since you order, get a number and someone brings out your food later.   The menu is large, extensive and easy to read.  You have several choices of sandwiches including burgers, prime rib, reuben and more.  Also there's several options for sides including fries, cheese curds, chili cheddar fries and more.  And then there's the frozen custard.  It's like ice cream but better!  Another Midwestern treat.  I went with the reuben which was recommended by the order taker.  Made it a combo with cheese curds and a drink. Then I waited (cue jeopardy theme).     Finally, it came out with an apologetic staff member.  Well the sandwich was well worth the wait.  It was the 2nd best reuben I've had recently.  Good flavors, mix of kraut and meat and slightly covered in a tangy thousand island sauce.  The cheese curds were a bit disappointing as they seemed to have been in the fryer for too long and were almost rock hard on the outside.  The seating in the dining room is too close together where you can barely move when all thee tables around you are occupied.  And the parking lot can be a bit awkward.  They definitely used every inch of space, inside and out.  Also the drive thru was quite busy although it didn't look it was very efficient.  You paid for your order and then it looked like you had to pull up into one of 6 spaces and wait for your order.  Might as well go inside if you have to do that.  Perhaps, the kinks haven't been worked out yet or perhaps this isn't as much of a well-oiled machine as a fast food joint.  But I would come back here for the reuben and maybe even try a few other things off their menu.",

Conveniently enough, there's one just 15 minutes or so from my house in Charlotte, located right across the street from Carowinds.  I've been here 3 times in the recent past and get the Sourdough Melt. It's pretty good--they like to advertise that they use fresh beef and cheese which is nice to know. I like to say it's the Chick-fil-a- of burgers--better than average fast food with excellent service.  The custard really is great--I had a mini concrete mixer with Reese's cups and brownie. They put a copious amount of toppings in which was great and the cold, smooth custard hit the spot. The mini size was enough to where I didn't feel like I was going to give myself a heart attack but still was satisfying.  Service is usually very good--no complaints anywhere here. I'd have no problem going back in the future.  Edit: I hate giving fast food places 5 stars, but went back a few more times, and the service here is excellent. 5th star awarded.",

    "text": "Wow.   I'm definitely a fan of this place. I haven't been inside yet, but I definitely look forward to it on my next trip! But my total experience was outstanding!!!   I arrived early Sunday afternoon a little after 11:00am and the place was pretty busy. I got up to the drive thru menu board and was easily overwhelmed. Which in this case was a good thing. They have burgers, sandwiches, salads and of course custard!!!   I had already checked out the menu online and since it was so early I just went with one of the Snack Paks- you get a menu item (chicken tenders, butter burger, etc, fries and a drink) for a little over $4. In my opinion that's a pretty good deal for the \"not so hungry\" customer.   So one of the major reasons I'm such a fan of this place is that after you order and pull up to the drive thru window you pay and they give you a number, you simply park your car in the spot that matches your number and they bring out the HOT, freshly prepared food to your car. AWESOME!!!!   Here's the run down, I went with the chicken tenders and fries with a root beer to drink:  Chicken Tenders- Yum! They were totally not what I expected. But in a good way. The tenders did not have too much breading and were not too crunchy...very good seasoning and the best part was the tenders were all white meat. Score! Totally a win in my book!   Fries- OMGGG....FINALLY....HOT crinkle cut french fries. Crispy, hot, and just freaking delicious! I totally wish I had ordered more!  Drink- Root Beer- Delish! Seriously, get it!   Unfortunately, this visit I didn't get any custard, but it's cool because it gives me an excellent reason to come back!  Soon!   I'd say that they got it right, excellent food and customer service and I can't wait to come back!   Good job Culver's!",

    "text": "My very first visit to a Culver's! I was so excited, and proceeded to get recommendations from all of my Midwestern and Culver's-loving friends to help me choose my menu!  I was told that I absolutely, positively had to get the fried cheese curds, and I will say, they didn't disappoint! Served hot and melty, they were yummy from start to finish! Definitely five stars!  Another highly recommended item, the butter burger, was less thrilling. I'm told I have to give this one another chance, because mine was overcooked, rough around the edges, and a bit dry. I'm willing to consider this an anomaly, but it bumped off a star.  Lastly, the custard... Creamy, chocolatey, heavenly! I am told next time I need to get a shake, as they are out of this world!  Lastly, allow me to say that the service at this Culver's was delightful. I asked a lot of questions, and was advised on the best and most affordable way for me to try all the items that had been recommended to me, with a smile and happy grace!",

This location is the superior option in the Charlotte area (the one next to IKEA has messed our order up every visit).  The service is outstanding!  After a recent trip to Carowinds on my birthday we stopped at Culver's for dinner.  The food was awesome as usual but we had an unusual experience while we were eating.  The manager (perhaps the owner?) asked us if we wouldn't mind standing up from our seats because a kid had redeemed their points and wanted a soccer ball.  I guess they were stored in the booth seats.  No problem! But he offered us a free dish of ice cream for our \"trouble\".  I told my fiance we didn't need it but JUST IN CASE... asked him to check the flavor of the day.  Thank goodness we did!  They were featuring my favorite flavor from childhood that I had given up on ever having again!  I was so pumped!  It made my birthday!   Side note: they do an amazing veggie burger here if you happen to be a vegetarian!",

Walked in and was immediately impressed with the size of the menu board. Very extensive with  something for everyone.    After some thought, I went with the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Fries on the side and a fountain drink.  You place your order and pay and they give you a little number to put on your table.  You get your own drink and take a seat and shortly your meal will be delivered to you.  Service was fast and friendly and I was impressed by the finger wipes they brought with my lunch. Nice touch.  The Pork Tenderloin unfortunately did not measure up.  A bit overcooked and with a greasy taste did not cut it. Fries on the other hand were very good.  Restaurant is very clean and well organized and apparently well managed.  Next time I'll try something a little different and maybe I can find something a bit more appealing.",

I got in the car and went thru the drive in. instead of giving the food out as it came we had to move forward wrapping around the building. Food is ok. I ordered onion rings instead of fries and got a decent amount. Normally would give 3-4 stars but I refuse extra stars for their lack of respect for people that are not Christian.",

Chicken, butter burgers, beef, pork, salads and of course cheese curds and delicious ice cold cream ... better affectionately known as ice cream.

That's like McDonalds being out of French fries. But we were there and hungry so we still ordered.  We got our concrete custard mixers right away. But then had to pull forward to wait with several other cars. Not so much fast food when you have to wait more than 5 mins for your food.

I ordered the deluxe meal with cheese bites and a vanilla shake with oreo mixed in. Yes, I went all out on my consolation meal.  The restaurant itself is clean and the staff are very friendly. The service to get the food to my table seemed slow but I can't remember a time a fast food restaurant brought my food to me so maybe it is the norm.  The food itself, sadly, was just OK. The burger patties were thin and overpowered by the thick cheese slices and my lettuce tasted off. The shake was delicious but half the oreos were hardly mixed in leaving big cookie chunks I couldn't eat. The cheese bites were probably the best part of the meal.  Maybe I expected too much from this place because their pictures online looked amazing. The food is decent and the place is much cleaner than many other fast food places but nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "Hello friends,   I ventured to this location the other day to try them out. I ordered the Chicken tenders and their signature \"Butter burger\". Well you have to tell them what you want on your burger. Or, at least I was asked what i wanted on it. That was cool, but i wasn't expecting the need to give them exact detail as the picture seemed like a regular burger with all the regular extras. When I got home much to my surprise I had bread and meat. As in a no frills burger. Yippyyyy I passed many burger joints to come here for a plain burger. - Side Eye-.  The chicken tenders were nothing impressive. Actually the whole ordeal was non eventful and lack luster would be a overstatement. I'll try again another time. I won't give them the 1star based off the one experience. Looking at the pictures fellow Yelpers posted I may go in and show them a picture of what I want next time who knows??  Cheers",

Their concretes are my favorite. They have plenty of mix ins to choose from. They also have a flavor of the day which is always a unique flavor. My favorite combinations are peanut butter/banana/caramel. I had raspberry once too which was also good. They do charge you for extra mix in toppings though.   If you're in the area, I would recommend stopping here to try their custard.",

Start reading up on it and once I saw someone compare it to In and Out Burger then I just HAD to try it.  So we decided to try it one night. It did not disappoint! Honestly I haven't been to In and Out in years so I'm not sure I can compare the two. That being said it was definitely better than any of the fast food chains we have down here in FL.  We stuck to the basic double cheese burger with fries (after ordering I realized they had cheese curds, wish I would of tried that!) I also got a chocolate milkshake. The burger was perfect and so were the fries and milkshake. They also bring it to your table which was cool.   The place itself was also very nice, it even had a fireplace, seemed odd, but good, for a fast food place. Complete satisfaction was achieved!",

On a business trip in Charlotte and was heading out of town and needing a quick bite we decided to stop. A 4 star fast food joint? Must try it...  First off for a fast food spot it's clean, restroom for men not smelly nor in shambles, dinning room free of overflowing trashcans and stray wrapper flying around.  Customer service was on point, felt as composed as In & Out in CA. Orderly and everyone getting the job done. The staff taking the orders, the cooks to the staff delivering your meals.  Culver's claim to fame is they toast the bread with butter. This along with your non traditional patty not like other restaurants, but with a patty flattened/pressed on the grill so the edges are crispy. So so tasty. I had the mushroom Swiss burger and bacon. Very tasty and recommend it.  All in all, good service, good food, clean location... What more do you need? Buon appetito.",

The good thing is that this Culver's is located right off the interstate. The curds were pretty average, and they offered marinara or ranch as a condiment. I went with the marinara. The breading is crispy, but my order was just lukewarm. For the cost of a regular order of curds ($4.xx total), there were only about eight little balls of cheese, so I think I prefer the fried cheese from another major chain. They also gave me the wrong change, so I had to wait for them to correct that error. This probably still won't deter me from trying their burgers and custard next time though, because I'm pretty curious.",

Culver's may be the best fast food hamburgers in America; or should I say \"Butter Burgers!\" Yes, they are topped with a pat of butter which melts lusciously over the beef patty and bun, giving it a wonderful richness!

I sat in the drive thru waiting area for 20 minutes (after waiting for 15 minutes in the drive thru line to order). When I went inside to ask about my order (2 chicken tender baskets) I found out the order never went through even though I had already paid. I never received an apology or an offer of a refund (which most restaurants will do if a customer had waited that long). The fry cook said she dropped the tenders when she saw the order but never got a ticket. The manager wanted to give me food that had been sitting for over 20 minutes. When I insisted on fresh food she got an attitude and refused to look and/or speak to me. She handed to food to an employee to give to me. When I asked another employee for the contact information for HQ, the employee did not know and asked Mama D. She told her I could go look it up myself. I have NEVER been treated that way in any dining establishment. I had been looking forward to Culver's all day as we were visiting Carowinds and do not have a Culver's locally. After the way I was treated I do not want to dine at ANY Culver's Restaurant. Managers like this can ruin the reputation of restaurants/chains. I would advise anyone who asks NOT to dine at that Culver's and especially not that location.",

    "text": "Our experience was overall middle of the road. Not great like some reviews nor terrible. Really liked the customer service even though at times it seemed eerily robotic. :)  My Butter Burger was smaller than my bun which irks me, yet it tasted fine. The cheese curds were tasty, but would have been 10x better  had they have been served hot.  BF thought the salad was fine--nothing to write home about.  I liked the root beer because it was not very sweet. The custard was pretty tasty too. If I am in the area, then I would return ( no special trip)",

I'd only been one other time on a trip to WI; before that I'd never heard of them.  We ate lunch yesterday on our way back from a weekend getaway.  Service with a smile and delicious food - the burgers have that nice dark caramelized char on them from the butter, and I love the cheese curds.  Custard will have to wait another time as we were about to bust.  Can't wait to go again soon!",

It's high quality fast food if thats possible.  The food is cooked fresh once you order so it comes out piping hot.  Can't go wrong here if your getting fast food.",

The butter burgers are delicious and the onion rings are my favorite. Root beer is a very popular drink in Wisconsin and you will know why once you taste the root beer at Culver's. I forgot to mention how delicious their custard is. They have a flavor of the day into schedule showing the flavors for the whole month.",
